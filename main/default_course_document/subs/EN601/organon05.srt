1
00:00:22,251 --> 00:00:40,382
I come back to paragraph 33 with sub-note 17, which I was asked by Tania

2
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:48,507
to comment on this footnote 17.

3
00:00:48,707 --> 00:01:04,494
Hahnemann in order to prove that the remedy is stronger than the disease

4
00:01:04,694 --> 00:01:15,746
has given in footnote 17 an example, which we will analyze and you will see

5
00:01:15,946 --> 00:01:19,355
what exactly is there.

6
00:01:29,406 --> 00:01:56,620
"A striking fact in corroboration of this is that, whilst previously to the year 1801,

7
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:06,154
when the smooth scarlatina of Sydenham still occasionally prevailed epidemically

8
00:02:06,354 --> 00:02:17,724
among children, it attacked without exception all children who had escaped it

9
00:02:17,924 --> 00:02:21,458
in a former epidemic.

10
00:02:29,828 --> 00:02:42,711
In a similar epidemic, which I witnessed in Konigslutter, on the contrary,

11
00:02:42,911 --> 00:02:53,310
all the children who took in time a very small dose of Belladonna remained

12
00:02:53,510 --> 00:03:02,620
unaffected by this highly infectious infantile disease."

13
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:13,805
Based on this paragraph there has been a lot of misunderstanding

14
00:03:14,005 --> 00:03:20,848
and a lot of damage was done to Homeopathy. Why?

15
00:03:21,048 --> 00:03:30,845
Because certain people thought that Homeopathy could act as a prophylactic

16
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:40,974
and they took this idea and carried it to such an extreme that the whole idea

17
00:03:41,174 --> 00:03:50,280
was ridiculed in the press especially in England and everywhere else

18
00:03:50,480 --> 00:04:02,112
and I have spoken about this and explained what actually had happened.

19
00:04:02,312 --> 00:04:13,627
Hahnemann is a human, he observes and he thinks and he brings out conclusions

20
00:04:13,827 --> 00:04:27,763
but that does not mean that what he writes should be kept as a kind of Holy Book

21
00:04:27,963 --> 00:04:36,858
that we should try to fit all of our experience within this idea.

22
00:04:45,597 --> 00:04:56,264
First of all he says, in an epidemic which he witnessed all children

23
00:04:56,464 --> 00:05:07,826
who took Belladonna were escaped.

24
00:05:08,026 --> 00:05:20,218
In an epidemic some of the people were affected. Not every child is affected.

25
00:05:20,418 --> 00:05:27,211
So he comes to the epidemic he saw.

26
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:37,847
Out of the children to whom he distributed Belladonna, let us say 1000 or 2000,

27
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:46,202
whatever number, he doesn't say, but one can imagine how many people could

28
00:05:46,402 --> 00:05:54,332
have been given Belladonna with the possibilities of distribution of his time.

29
00:05:54,532 --> 00:06:04,949
So out of these children a big number would not be affected in any case.

30
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:14,305
Because in all epidemics it's like this.

31
00:06:14,505 --> 00:06:27,235
If we believe that all children were protected, which I will accept, what actually

32
00:06:27,435 --> 00:06:38,403
happened is that, he says he distributed the remedy during the epidemic

33
00:06:38,603 --> 00:06:47,601
and most probably he gave Belladonna 30CH or 15CH, he doesn't say.

34
00:06:47,801 --> 00:06:59,591
He gave the Belladonna as a protection, so the scarlatina of Sydenham has

35
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:08,285
a perfect picture of Belladonna.

36
00:07:08,485 --> 00:07:17,736
So what actually has happened most probably is that the children

37
00:07:17,936 --> 00:07:29,260
who were starting getting the epidemic, out of the 2000, the 100 children started,

38
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:41,886
they took Belladonna which acted curatively and it cured them before

39
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:49,094
they had developed a full blown of a scarlatina case.

40
00:07:51,600 --> 00:08:02,562
Because we know the genius of an epidemic, if we realize that we have a genius

41
00:08:02,762 --> 00:08:11,190
in action and we realize this epidemic has definitely the characteristic of

42
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:19,000
Eupatorium perfoliatum, we can in prevention give to our patient

43
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:26,983
Eupatorium perfoliatum, most probably to prevent, but it's not preventing,

44
00:08:27,183 --> 00:08:41,512
to cure them in case they start having the problem.

45
00:08:41,712 --> 00:08:52,334
Hahnemann's idea was that Belladonna was a strong medicine that

46
00:08:52,534 --> 00:09:03,277
fought the disease, suppressed and did not allow the disease to come.

47
00:09:03,477 --> 00:09:14,896
But actually it was a curative action of Belladonna in a typical case of Belladonna.

48
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:27,140
When an acute starts and you give Aconitum, the cases that respond to Aconitum,

49
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:35,029
next day will be Ok.

50
00:09:35,229 --> 00:09:38,588
Because this is the remedy which is needed.

51
00:09:38,788 --> 00:09:53,840
In the same way Hahnemann had observed this and

52
00:09:55,278 --> 00:10:02,695
I'm sure that not all children were protected. There were 2 or 3 children who needed

53
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:11,356
Eupatorium perfoliatum or Aconitum or some other remedy that would continue

54
00:10:11,556 --> 00:10:19,589
to be affected. But the general impression is that the remedy prevented

55
00:10:19,789 --> 00:10:24,035
the children from getting scarlatina.

56
00:10:33,788 --> 00:10:44,466
Otherwise, if you think that Homeopathy can act as an preventive outside of

57
00:10:44,666 --> 00:11:00,493
an epidemic, that means you think I will distribute Thuja in case smallpox comes,

58
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:06,991
people are covered by Thuja and people will be protected by Thuja.

59
00:11:07,191 --> 00:11:15,654
Because Thuja is the genius for smallpox.

60
00:11:15,854 --> 00:11:23,853
If you do this and the epidemic really comes, then you are going to be in a big trouble.

61
00:11:24,053 --> 00:11:33,130
Because you have given this year Thuja and you say take Thuja you are protected

62
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:42,355
and the epidemic comes 6 months later, 1, 2, 3 years later... you are not protected.

63
00:11:42,555 --> 00:11:53,094
Thuja may protect you when the epidemic is on and act as a curative action.

64
00:11:53,294 --> 00:12:06,231
Not as preventive. Because a remedy which has similar symptoms will act only

65
00:12:06,431 --> 00:12:15,579
in the case the organism develops symptoms similar to the remedy.

66
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:19,558
It's very simple.

67
00:12:19,758 --> 00:12:25,499
Unless you have the symptoms in the organism, you cannot imagine that

68
00:12:25,699 --> 00:12:34,215
this potency given 1, 2, 3 or, as many as you like, will do anything

69
00:12:34,415 --> 00:12:40,030
because in an organism in which Thuja is not indicated at this moment,

70
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:43,440
there is no epidemic, it's not indicated.

71
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:50,657
And I give Thuja to protect you from next year's epidemic, this is stupid, this is crazy.

72
00:12:50,857 --> 00:12:57,578
This is a misunderstanding of the whole Theory of Homeopathy.

73
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:05,894
A remedy will act only if there are its symptoms in the patient.

74
00:13:06,094 --> 00:13:12,516
Otherwise it will not act.

75
00:13:12,716 --> 00:13:27,470
This idea was totally misunderstood and I was bypassing it because

76
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,926
I didn't want to make the point but since Tania brought this point

77
00:13:30,126 --> 00:13:44,473
I had to explain to you that there are certain points which Hahnemann

78
00:13:44,673 --> 00:13:51,993
is not the absolute, the all-wise God that knows everything.

79
00:13:52,193 --> 00:13:58,682
Neither me, nor any human living on the earth.

80
00:13:58,882 --> 00:14:07,720
But we have some things which are logical and which we consider them as correct

81
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:14,768
because we have seen them working in practice.

82
00:14:14,968 --> 00:14:25,936
Further than the time of Hahnemann that he was facing different problems,

83
00:14:26,136 --> 00:14:29,426
today we face quite different problems.

84
00:14:29,626 --> 00:14:36,570
Today we face much more difficult problems than what Hahnemann

85
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:41,087
was facing himself.

86
00:14:44,341 --> 00:15:00,964
Hahnemann himself realized that giving a remedy in a chronic case did not always - though it fitted - cure the case.

87
00:15:03,323 --> 00:15:12,928
So he said why? It must be the miasm behind, the levels. What kind of miasm? Then he investigated.

88
00:15:13,128 --> 00:15:26,907
Syphilis, gonorrhea etc. Then he started thinking this, what I have said, that the remedy

89
00:15:27,107 --> 00:15:36,080
is more powerful... maybe it's not so, maybe something else is happening.

90
00:15:43,842 --> 00:16:00,609
Today Dimitri from Siberia brought me something from Chronic Diseases.

91
00:16:02,865 --> 00:16:09,177
This is written 20 years later after the Organon.

92
00:16:09,377 --> 00:16:17,747
I would like to know the page also. Because I do not remember this.

93
00:16:17,947 --> 00:16:25,127
But if that is true and Dimitri says he has just photocopied the book,

94
00:16:25,327 --> 00:16:29,400
so there is no question about that.

95
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:36,182
See what Hahnemann had said 20 years later concerning this matter.

96
00:16:47,985 --> 00:17:02,244
He tries to excuse himself for what he had said and he writes:

97
00:17:02,444 --> 00:17:11,596
"Of itself this vital principle [...] opposes only a weak resistance to the invading

98
00:17:11,796 --> 00:17:23,677
morbific enemy; as the disease grows and increases it opposes a greater resistance,

99
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:30,657
but at best it is only an equal resistance;

100
00:17:30,857 --> 00:17:35,870
with weakly patients it is not even equal, but weaker.

101
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:41,314
This force is neither capable, nor destined, nor created for

102
00:17:41,514 --> 00:17:49,398
an overpowering resistance, which will do no harm to itself.

103
00:17:49,598 --> 00:17:58,607
But if we physicians are able to present and oppose to this instinctive vital force,

104
00:17:58,807 --> 00:18:07,349
its morbific enemy, as it were magnified through the action of homoeopathic

105
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:17,227
medicines, if in this way the image of the morbific foe be magnified to the

106
00:18:17,427 --> 00:18:24,273
apprehension of the vital principle through homoeopathic medicines, which,

107
00:18:24,473 --> 00:18:36,782
in a delusive manner, simulates the original disease, we gradually cause and compel

108
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:55,020
this instinctive vital force..." To do what by the remedy?

109
00:18:55,220 --> 00:19:04,874
"to increase its energies by degrees". I did not remember this,

110
00:19:05,074 --> 00:19:09,242
it's first time I've seen it, that's why I doubted but it's exactly

111
00:19:13,771 --> 00:19:17,277
 what I have explained later in all my books.

112
00:19:17,477 --> 00:19:29,745
We compel the vital force - when we say the vital force we mean

113
00:19:29,945 --> 00:19:39,718
the defense mechanism-, we give extra energy to the vital force to face the problem.

114
00:19:41,195 --> 00:19:55,654
"[...]to increase its energies by degrees and to increase them more and more..."

115
00:19:57,454 --> 00:20:00,470
by repeating the remedy.

116
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:08,907
"[...] and at last to such a degree that it becomes far more powerful than

117
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:10,666
the original disease."

118
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:23,290
He comes exactly to what I have said. He tries to excuse himself for what

119
00:20:23,803 --> 00:20:28,179
he had published in 1910, 20 years later.

120
00:20:35,547 --> 00:20:50,246
"[...] The consequence of this is that the vital force again becomes sovereign

121
00:20:50,638 --> 00:20:58,897
in its domain, can again hold and direct the reins of sanitary progress,

122
00:20:59,513 --> 00:21:05,549
while the apparent increase of the disease caused by homoeopathic medicines

123
00:21:05,813 --> 00:21:09,013
disappears of itself".

124
00:21:09,846 --> 00:21:30,550
Here he wants to excuse the initial aggravation because he could see that

125
00:21:31,086 --> 00:21:42,518
by giving continuously remedies produced also some extra symptoms in the patient.

126
00:21:43,102 --> 00:21:49,054
And he said these extra symptoms which are produced by the remedy

127
00:21:50,382 --> 00:21:57,886
will disappear eventually by themselves. Thank you.

128
00:21:58,305 --> 00:22:05,268
But we will eventually discuss the idea of aggravation of Hahnemann

129
00:22:07,206 --> 00:22:11,110
and the idea of aggravation as we know it today.

130
00:22:16,254 --> 00:22:22,014
It's very interesting because I could not remember this.

131
00:22:22,534 --> 00:22:28,106
Most probably I just passed it 50 years ago when I was reading.

132
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:54,202
-My understanding from this scarlatina example is that the children who were

133
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:58,626
really helped with Belladonna, they already were in a Belladonna state, but in initial

134
00:22:59,082 --> 00:23:02,522
stages, that's why the remedy worked. Is that correct?

135
00:23:03,826 --> 00:23:07,042
So could you please explain to us the genius epidemicus?

136
00:23:13,754 --> 00:23:23,514
-The genius epidemicus is that many organisms when stimulated by a specific agent,

137
00:23:24,995 --> 00:23:31,530
morbific agent produce a reaction which is similar with one another.

138
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:44,594
It looks like one of our remedies. In influenza, most probably a lot of cases

139
00:23:45,042 --> 00:23:47,642
will look like Gelsemium.

140
00:23:48,922 --> 00:23:57,210
But in another influenza many times the epidemic will look like

141
00:23:57,699 --> 00:24:05,962
Eupatorium perfoliatum. Another time will look like Rhus tox.

142
00:24:07,282 --> 00:24:09,858
Another time may look like Arsenicum.

143
00:24:10,306 --> 00:24:19,330
At this specific time when the epidemic is hitting the children,

144
00:24:22,042 --> 00:24:27,162
a lot of parameters are taken into consideration from the organism and

145
00:24:27,714 --> 00:24:36,017
the organism decides to make a specific reaction, which gives you the impression

146
00:24:36,762 --> 00:24:43,538
that a lot of these people are having a picture of Gelsemium

147
00:24:44,018 --> 00:24:50,066
or a picture of Eupatorium perfoliatum. A lot, never all.

148
00:24:52,339 --> 00:25:03,027
If you do it as a routine practice and you give a remedy in an epidemic, you give it

149
00:25:04,258 --> 00:25:06,786
to everyone, not everyone will be cured.

150
00:25:12,018 --> 00:25:18,947
Sometimes also the genius epidemicus, that means the remedy that covers most

151
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:24,218
of the cases is only less than 50% of the cases.

152
00:25:29,506 --> 00:25:39,299
Therefore this idea of Hahnemann was an observation and he writes it down

153
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:42,386
in a footnote.

154
00:25:52,826 --> 00:25:57,598
Otherwise Hahnemann would have said here we have a preventing medicine

155
00:25:58,595 --> 00:26:01,666
for every epidemic and you give this and that...

156
00:26:03,418 --> 00:26:10,841
If he was sure about a preventive medicine, he would have said it somewhere.

157
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:20,458
He says nowhere that there is a preventing medicine, that we can give in every

158
00:26:20,794 --> 00:26:28,153
epidemic. Not only that, but he talks about during the specific epidemic

159
00:26:29,706 --> 00:26:40,475
where Belladonna was indicated specifically in the majority of the cases.

160
00:26:44,274 --> 00:27:01,834
Paragraph 38, "Or the new dissimilar disease is the stronger of the two.

161
00:27:03,354 --> 00:27:10,570
In this case the disease under which the patient originally labored, being the weaker,

162
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:17,921
will be kept back and suspended by the accession of the stronger one".

163
00:27:19,506 --> 00:27:26,346
This is exactly what happened later on in our times.

164
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:39,722
We gave antibiotics and we gave actually a disease, a disturbance on the vital force,

165
00:27:41,682 --> 00:27:50,689
which was more powerful than the disease that we were trying to cure.

166
00:27:51,425 --> 00:27:58,721
And in this way they suppress it, they suspend. The stronger suspends the other one

167
00:27:59,402 --> 00:28:01,450
that goes to the background.

168
00:28:02,154 --> 00:28:09,289
"[...] until the latter shall have run its course or been cured, and then the old one

169
00:28:10,194 --> 00:28:11,402
reappears uncured."

170
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:22,635
The same exactly that happens when you give antibiotics in a chronic cystitis case,

171
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:34,394
this cystitis goes away suppressed, then you say "Ok, this case is cured" but

172
00:28:34,874 --> 00:28:37,930
after a month or two cystitis is back.

173
00:28:39,746 --> 00:28:48,585
Back in the paragraph 38, he gives some examples.

174
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:56,018
"[...]  Two children affected with a kind of epilepsy, remained free from epileptic

175
00:28:56,418 --> 00:29:08,402
attacks after infection with ringworm (tinea) but as soon as the eruption on the head

176
00:29:08,858 --> 00:29:16,769
was gone the epilepsy returned just as before, as Tulpius observed".

177
00:29:18,441 --> 00:29:29,818
Can anybody comment on this example of Hahnemann? Is this a correct example or

178
00:29:30,794 --> 00:29:41,738
is it the wrong example? Yes Dimitri. Dimitri is following.

179
00:29:48,682 --> 00:29:53,329
-I think this is a wrong example because it is an example of law of Herring.

180
00:29:57,906 --> 00:30:03,957
-It is the wrong example because most probably the child was given some kind

181
00:30:04,178 --> 00:30:12,295
of medicine for epilepsy and eventually his organism went to a state where he could

182
00:30:13,031 --> 00:30:15,926
be affected by a ringworm.

183
00:30:17,538 --> 00:30:24,443
An organism in order to be affected by a ringworm, has to be in a certain state

184
00:30:25,842 --> 00:30:34,169
of health. So when his state of health from a deeper disorder went to a better state

185
00:30:34,498 --> 00:30:41,210
of health, was vulnerable after that to a certain outside influences.

186
00:30:42,026 --> 00:30:51,850
Ringworm was one of these influences. When this developed and the inner problem,

187
00:30:52,586 --> 00:31:01,886
you will be surprised to see the difference between somebody who has been

188
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:08,534
suppressed by ringworm and his mental/ emotional state...

189
00:31:19,726 --> 00:31:35,238
Ringworm is very strong infection of the skin and has to be very carefully treated

190
00:31:35,782 --> 00:31:39,478
and respected. This is my experience.

191
00:31:41,246 --> 00:31:48,830
And people who can be affected by a ringworm are in a quite good state of health.

192
00:31:51,461 --> 00:31:56,485
If you don't understand something, you must tell me.

193
00:31:59,302 --> 00:32:23,582
Ringworm or wringworm?. It is an infection that starts with a point

194
00:32:24,965 --> 00:32:33,389
which becomes very itchy, red and a little bit higher than the skin.

195
00:32:34,334 --> 00:32:47,654
Then it starts expanding in a circular manner and can cover huge areas.

196
00:32:53,782 --> 00:33:07,270
Latin name? Tinea capitis. I am not sure the tinea capitis which he mentions here

197
00:33:07,702 --> 00:33:15,855
is the same as ringworm. Anybody who is a skin specialist here?

198
00:33:34,349 --> 00:33:53,941
Herpes circinatus.

199
00:33:54,178 --> 00:34:05,706
But in any case real ringworm it is, as I described to you, very itchy and

200
00:34:06,897 --> 00:34:18,042
as the ring forms by little pimples which are extremely itchy and the color

201
00:34:18,498 --> 00:34:27,578
of the skin changes... It's a very annoying itching and very difficult

202
00:34:28,137 --> 00:34:30,265
to cure with Homeopathy.

203
00:34:31,106 --> 00:34:52,418
The cause? It's not a fungus. A little insect.

204
00:35:31,066 --> 00:35:36,289
The other example he gives again is wrong.

205
00:35:36,785 --> 00:36:07,329
The itch most probably means psora, scabies, which eat up the skin and creates itch

206
00:36:08,337 --> 00:36:17,058
"[...] scabies as Schopf saw, disappeared on the occurrence of the scurvy,

207
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:24,601
but after the cure of the latter it again broke out".

208
00:36:25,305 --> 00:36:36,498
So the person with the psora, was suppressed, scurvy developed, an inner condition

209
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:45,193
most probably were given some remedies and the psora reappeared.

210
00:36:53,578 --> 00:37:02,994
"[...]So, also the pulmonary phthisis remained stationary when the patient was

211
00:37:03,457 --> 00:37:15,922
attacked by a violent typhus, but went on again after the latter had run its course.

212
00:37:23,697 --> 00:37:33,538
If mania occurs in a consumptive patient, the phthisis with all its symptoms

213
00:37:34,306 --> 00:37:38,921
is removed by the former..."

214
00:37:47,730 --> 00:38:02,674
The manic depression in a tuberculous patient, as soon as the manic depression is

215
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:15,178
manifested, the tuberculosis disappears. That means it went inside.

216
00:38:17,794 --> 00:38:25,482
The tuberculosis is a better state than manic depression. But if tuberculosis is treated

217
00:38:26,066 --> 00:38:32,769
wrongly, suppressively, we will have a consequence and the consequence may be

218
00:38:33,537 --> 00:38:39,233
as bad as a mental derangement.

219
00:38:46,977 --> 00:38:55,114
"[...] but if that goes off, the phthisis returns immediately and proves fatal"

220
00:38:59,738 --> 00:39:07,625
When the tuberculosis is very strong and is going to lead the patient to death

221
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:17,889
and we manage through strong drugs to suppress this we create schizophrenia.

222
00:39:22,113 --> 00:39:33,354
If we treat the schizophrenia and it goes away then all the phthisis comes back

223
00:39:35,098 --> 00:39:40,441
so strong that nothing can help anymore and the patient dies.

224
00:39:45,818 --> 00:39:51,114
You see how clearly everything was said.

225
00:39:56,177 --> 00:40:04,377
"[...]When measles and smallpox are prevalent at the same time and both attack

226
00:40:04,756 --> 00:40:10,778
the same child, the measles that had already broken out is generally checked

227
00:40:11,298 --> 00:40:19,617
by the smallpox that came somewhat later; nor does the measles resume its course

228
00:40:20,458 --> 00:40:24,250
until after the cure of the smallpox.

229
00:40:28,698 --> 00:40:37,377
But it not infrequently happens that the inoculated smallpox is suspended for

230
00:40:37,858 --> 00:40:45,394
four days by the supervention of the measles, as observed by Manget..."

231
00:40:48,337 --> 00:41:02,706
"but it not infrequently happens that the inoculated smallpox..." I don't understand

232
00:41:02,962 --> 00:41:10,858
what he means here. They did not have vaccination by that time.

233
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:18,978
In any case the example is an example we don't exactly understand.

234
00:41:20,562 --> 00:41:26,817
He brings several example that give his idea. The examples are good enough.

235
00:41:28,137 --> 00:41:32,537
"[...]In an epidemic of measles, that disease attacked many individuals on the fourth

236
00:41:33,106 --> 00:41:38,362
or fifth day after the inoculation of smallpox and prevented the development of

237
00:41:38,874 --> 00:41:43,209
the smallpox [...] The true, smooth, erysipelatous-looking scarlatina of Sydenham,

238
00:41:43,633 --> 00:41:50,657
with sore throat, was checked on the fourth day by the eruption of cow-pox,

239
00:41:52,274 --> 00:41:59,001
which ran its regular course, and not till it was ended did the scarlatina again

240
00:41:59,521 --> 00:42:01,041
establish itself."

241
00:42:02,265 --> 00:42:13,929
So these are examples which on the whole they give the idea that disease can

242
00:42:14,817 --> 00:42:23,401
be suppressed by a stronger disease, by a stronger medicine that we have today.

243
00:42:24,098 --> 00:42:31,074
This is the idea. It's not suppressed only by one disease suppressing the other.

244
00:42:32,233 --> 00:42:39,705
Today what is happening is that diseases are suppressed with strong chemical drugs.

245
00:42:41,218 --> 00:42:53,050
Strong chemical drugs establish their own reign and do not allow the original disease

246
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:55,217
to appear.

247
00:42:55,993 --> 00:43:11,073
If the organism manages to get rid of the effect of the chemical drug, then the original

248
00:43:11,617 --> 00:43:19,665
disease reappears. What we know today to be the usual practice when they get

249
00:43:23,625 --> 00:43:32,858
a strong conventional medicine and the patient remains without symptoms for a period

250
00:43:33,362 --> 00:43:38,954
of time and after some time there is a relapse.

251
00:43:41,537 --> 00:43:49,617
Take again the conventional medicine and the third relapse doesn't manifest anymore.

252
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:55,603
What has happened? The problem has gone deeper. Then they come to the

253
00:43:55,978 --> 00:44:03,657
homeopath who has to unravel all this and to bring back the original problem.

254
00:44:04,154 --> 00:44:08,297
But the original problem could also be in the ancestors.

255
00:44:10,018 --> 00:44:12,874
It's not in the person himself.

256
00:44:14,626 --> 00:44:18,241
In the person who was born healthy, yes we can do a lot.

257
00:44:18,625 --> 00:44:26,914
But the person who was born with a hereditary predisposition due to the parents,

258
00:44:29,538 --> 00:44:38,274
we cannot reach him but up to a certain extent. Only if the person was born healthy,

259
00:44:39,961 --> 00:44:47,945
then we can make him healthy again even if certain of his diseases were suppressed

260
00:44:48,442 --> 00:44:49,882
all along.

261
00:44:52,665 --> 00:45:05,562
But the persons whose parents were unhealthy and they gave birth to a child

262
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:18,906
with strong and dangerous predispositions is not possible to alleviate totally.

263
00:45:19,871 --> 00:45:22,679
We can relieve them up to a certain extent.

264
00:45:23,335 --> 00:45:32,807
They can live comfortably but will never attain this joy of the healthy people,

265
00:45:34,543 --> 00:45:40,095
which I was talking about.

266
00:45:51,111 --> 00:45:57,999
So do you want me to answer this? Ok, there is a question here.

267
00:45:58,408 --> 00:46:07,087
He says yesterday you explained how your view about your homeopathic process is,

268
00:46:07,455 --> 00:46:11,255
it differs from Hahnemann's. For Hahnemann the remedies overwhelms the disease,

269
00:46:11,943 --> 00:46:18,943
for you the remedy stimulates the vital force so that symptoms are increased

270
00:46:19,975 --> 00:46:24,959
and overwhelm the disease. No, this is not what I said.

271
00:46:27,647 --> 00:46:34,167
You have to understand the logic, otherwise you will be confused.

272
00:46:34,784 --> 00:46:45,352
The logic is that the organism always in all diseases wants to cure itself, how?

273
00:46:46,871 --> 00:46:59,743
By symptoms. Symptoms are manifested in order to counteract the invasion,

274
00:47:00,255 --> 00:47:11,736
the disease. But why in chronic condition the disease is not cured?

275
00:47:12,775 --> 00:47:20,526
You have chronic headaches and with the least stress you have a migraine

276
00:47:22,015 --> 00:47:31,230
and you take some painkillers and the migraine is tolerable but next week

277
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:40,870
you have a little bit of stress, or without stress, the symptoms reappear.

278
00:47:41,302 --> 00:47:48,237
Take again the painkillers. Every 15 or 20 days symptoms disappear.

279
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:59,753
These symptoms are an effort of the organism to overcome the disease.

280
00:48:02,249 --> 00:48:24,057
And the chemical organism in its multiplicity decides that the best thing for me

281
00:48:24,465 --> 00:48:37,361
at the moment is to relax an artery in the brain, therefore you have the pain or

282
00:48:38,641 --> 00:48:45,136
to constrict an artery in the brain. I'm talking grossly.

283
00:48:47,528 --> 00:48:58,568
This constriction of the artery is to prevent further damage of the organism.

284
00:48:59,255 --> 00:49:10,488
This is the best thing the organism can do. Because there is a chemical imbalance

285
00:49:10,816 --> 00:49:19,016
in the whole organism and the best thing that the organism can do is to have a stricture

286
00:49:19,463 --> 00:49:24,911
of an artery and as a result you feel the pain.

287
00:49:27,576 --> 00:49:34,783
But why does the migraine come again and again? It is an effort.

288
00:49:35,503 --> 00:49:44,543
You say that Ok this is an effort of the organism to cure itself through this migraine.

289
00:49:46,064 --> 00:49:53,031
But why the organism makes an effort again and again for 10 years?

290
00:49:53,816 --> 00:49:57,944
Every 15 days I have migraines for 10 years.

291
00:49:59,712 --> 00:50:07,615
Hahnemann will say that in chronic diseases, the organism by itself cannot be cured.

292
00:50:09,375 --> 00:50:18,248
I say that this is the best way the organism is trying to cure the imbalance, not only

293
00:50:18,928 --> 00:50:24,519
the migraine but the general imbalance that exists in the body.

294
00:50:28,127 --> 00:50:39,711
So if this is true, what happens is that the organism does not have the means,

295
00:50:40,951 --> 00:50:52,368
though he tries, to make a final effort and finally get rid of the disturbance.

296
00:50:54,888 --> 00:51:05,440
Cannot make a super effort. So here we come and we give a remedy

297
00:51:07,992 --> 00:51:16,936
which gives the extra energy that the organism is needing in order to overcome

298
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:33,495
the problem. We give, therefore we stimulate, so next day the migraine becomes

299
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:39,311
excessive. First time in my life I had such a big migraine.

300
00:51:39,672 --> 00:51:43,464
But after that the migraines are cured.

301
00:51:50,951 --> 00:51:54,783
How this was done? It is simple.

302
00:51:55,096 --> 00:52:02,120
The organism gives out as a reaction a totality of symptoms.

303
00:52:04,032 --> 00:52:11,015
You get a remedy to which the organism is very sensitive because that remedy

304
00:52:11,304 --> 00:52:21,160
you choose, can produce similar symptoms. That means the symptoms that

305
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:28,751
are there increase. If you don't perceive this idea you will never understand

306
00:52:29,263 --> 00:52:33,655
what's going on. You have to be very careful.

307
00:52:34,168 --> 00:52:45,440
If you don't perceive it, forget it. The organism gives a push.

308
00:52:47,111 --> 00:52:54,399
The defense mechanism is trying to cure itself through the symptoms and cannot.

309
00:52:55,056 --> 00:52:59,943
Here we come with a remedy, we give the extra energy he needs in order

310
00:53:00,647 --> 00:53:06,207
to overcome. That's why there is an initial aggravation.

311
00:53:14,096 --> 00:53:19,743
Somebody may say "I don't understand". Please say it because otherwise

312
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:30,128
it will be useless to continue. You have to understand this process.

313
00:53:34,024 --> 00:53:45,176
The organism when it is stimulated by the similar process like the disease,

314
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:49,528
increases the symptoms.

315
00:53:50,344 --> 00:54:00,183
So Hahnemann later on will say, then when I gave the remedy in very small doses

316
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:08,495
I saw that there were a lot of aggravations, so I had to reduce the dose.

317
00:54:19,264 --> 00:54:30,111
Is anybody who does not understand this concept? You do not?

318
00:54:36,338 --> 00:54:41,777
It's very different. You say "and overwhelms the disease".

319
00:54:43,906 --> 00:54:48,138
It pushes the disease to become more. Not overwhelm.

320
00:54:48,914 --> 00:54:55,722
Overwhelm means to cover the disease. This is a wrong concept.

321
00:54:57,826 --> 00:55:03,898
It is increasing the disease, not overwhelm. Overwhelm means suppresses.

322
00:55:06,098 --> 00:55:12,850
This is the difference. Increases the disease.

323
00:55:13,842 --> 00:55:20,281
Gives an extra energy to the defense mechanism so the defense mechanism makes

324
00:55:20,986 --> 00:55:27,770
the final effort and the disease is over. Why the disease is over?

325
00:55:28,010 --> 00:55:36,569
Because already the effort of the organism through symptoms was an effort of

326
00:55:37,914 --> 00:55:47,282
trying to cure itself. That is why he does not have enough energy to overcome

327
00:55:49,762 --> 00:55:55,658
and there is repetition. We give the extra energy and we increase, not overwhelm,

328
00:55:56,074 --> 00:56:01,514
not suppress. Otherwise Hahnemann says overwhelms the disease.

329
00:56:05,346 --> 00:56:12,017
The remedy is stronger and overwhelms the disease and the disease is finished.

330
00:56:12,226 --> 00:56:25,562
But later on he comes to my idea. He says the same thing. Give energies more

331
00:56:25,938 --> 00:56:40,195
and more "[...] we gradually cause and compel the vital force to increase its energies"

332
00:56:40,674 --> 00:56:47,689
To increase, not to overwhelm. The remedy that we give increases the reaction,

333
00:56:48,330 --> 00:57:01,202
the energy of the vital force. You still have a problem?

334
00:57:10,442 --> 00:57:16,498
Who has a problem? Did you write down?

335
00:57:32,914 --> 00:57:42,650
-The remedy creates symptoms. The primary reaction is the reaction of the remedy.

336
00:57:44,001 --> 00:57:46,922
And the secondary reaction is the reaction of the vital force...

337
00:57:47,762 --> 00:57:53,065
-Don't confuse yet the primary and the secondary reaction because it's different...

338
00:57:53,506 --> 00:57:57,473
-I have a question. How the remedy increases the vital force?

339
00:57:57,897 --> 00:58:10,698
-I just explained. You have an organism who has decided to cure itself

340
00:58:11,298 --> 00:58:19,058
through 10 symptoms. That means he has brought out 10 symptoms that

341
00:58:19,265 --> 00:58:23,161
bother the patient.

342
00:58:28,498 --> 00:58:35,409
The remedy you choose to cure produces similar symptoms. What is going to happen?

343
00:58:36,865 --> 00:58:45,698
If you have diarrhea and you have a remedy that produces diarrhea and you take it.

344
00:58:55,721 --> 00:59:02,257
If you have diarrhea and you take a remedy, not high potency, low potency,

345
00:59:04,626 --> 00:59:13,121
Arsenicum. If you take Arsenicum by the time you have diarrhea and the diarrhea

346
00:59:13,561 --> 00:59:21,657
is of an Arsenicum type and you take a little bit of Arsenicum what is going to happen?

347
00:59:24,737 --> 00:59:30,641
The diarrhea will increase, most probably the person will die because the diarrhea

348
00:59:31,057 --> 00:59:37,865
will be increased. If I have a symptom and the remedy I take creates the same

349
00:59:38,242 --> 00:59:41,962
symptom, that means this symptom will become more.

350
00:59:42,505 --> 00:59:47,201
-But it's a little more.

351
00:59:47,497 --> 00:59:57,386
-Later on he will say how to reduce the dose so it not be dangerous for the patient.

352
01:00:07,647 --> 01:00:15,526
Before we go to LM potencies we have to understand so far...

353
01:00:15,911 --> 01:00:24,143
We'll talk about LM potencies but not now, otherwise we'll get confused...

354
01:00:24,583 --> 01:00:39,367
Later on, I don't know when... Most probably I will do this again a few times

355
01:00:39,583 --> 01:00:45,647
until I cover the whole thing and most probably the whole thing will be given

356
01:00:45,927 --> 01:00:55,919
to the students who will take the E-learning for students who are serious and

357
01:00:56,159 --> 01:01:00,327
really want to study.

358
01:01:01,023 --> 01:01:09,766
But at this moment we have the facts so far.

359
01:01:10,311 --> 01:01:15,167
Later on Hahnemann will speak about the dose, how to reduce the dose,

360
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:24,519
how he felt that the patient was getting too many aggravations because

361
01:01:24,968 --> 01:01:34,808
of the dose etc. Hahnemann himself supports my idea.

362
01:01:35,887 --> 01:01:43,654
Because later on he will say if you give a remedy that produces the same symptoms

363
01:01:43,951 --> 01:01:51,064
of course there is aggravation and then to reduce the dose and reduces not only

364
01:01:51,271 --> 01:01:56,839
the dose but the potency and how he came to the idea of the potency.

365
01:01:58,096 --> 01:02:06,463
The genius of Hahnemann was that he came to the idea of potentizing the remedy

366
01:02:06,863 --> 01:02:13,663
to the extent that there was no chemical substance left anymore.

367
01:02:14,728 --> 01:02:25,687
This is a discovery worth 10 at least Nobel prizes.

368
01:02:34,967 --> 01:02:42,888
-I think that the confusion comes from us saying that the remedy produces symptoms.

369
01:02:43,735 --> 01:02:50,927
From what you say it's not a remedy which produces symptoms,

370
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:57,823
the remedy acts on the vital force. And the vital force is the only one that reacts.

371
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:03,471
So we say that the remedy produces symptoms, but it's the vital force which

372
01:03:03,791 --> 01:03:06,903
produces symptoms under the effect of the remedy.

373
01:03:07,151 --> 01:03:19,439
-Exactly. The vital force is reacting to disease producing symptoms.

374
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:26,656
The vital force is reacting to medicines producing symptoms.

375
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:33,511
Which is the remedy that will help this case?

376
01:03:44,496 --> 01:04:06,548
I thought you are a ghost at the moment I saw you there... Stop this. I'm afraid.

377
01:04:08,752 --> 01:04:20,904
This is correct what you say, after this clarification is it understandable what I say?

378
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:28,848
Ok. Who has not understood yet?

379
01:04:41,384 --> 01:04:57,624
These ideas were written in my "Science of Homeopathy" back in 1976

380
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:09,487
when I was writing the book published in 1978 for the first and this was one of

381
01:05:09,712 --> 01:05:16,400
the basic ideas. When later I was teaching "Levels of Health"...

382
01:05:19,448 --> 01:05:24,103
By that time I mentioned the Levels of Health in the original book.

383
01:05:24,936 --> 01:05:28,296
Later on I say more about the Levels of Health in the

384
01:05:29,584 --> 01:05:36,304
"New Model of Health and Disease", in my book which I think it's a very

385
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:43,455
instructive book for anyone who wants to understand what is happening

386
01:05:43,711 --> 01:05:45,599
with the human body.

387
01:05:46,248 --> 01:05:59,320
Then in 1995 I decided to give a series of lectures in a 4-year course, the original

388
01:05:59,519 --> 01:06:03,935
course... who was in the original course?

389
01:06:10,056 --> 01:06:15,359
I decided to give the original course in which I explained everything

390
01:06:16,511 --> 01:06:19,631
that I had experienced so far.

391
01:06:23,129 --> 01:06:36,504
What I do now concerning the "Organon", I try to clarify what Hahnemann

392
01:06:37,288 --> 01:06:51,312
was writing and also the different aspects of my understanding from the ideas

393
01:06:51,607 --> 01:06:59,471
of Hahnemann. That does not mean in any way that Hahnemann was not correct

394
01:06:59,912 --> 01:07:06,887
or I am greater than Hahnemann, I hope you understand that.

395
01:07:07,439 --> 01:07:15,327
I'm trying to give you my experience based on the ideas of Hahnemann.

396
01:07:22,272 --> 01:07:26,591
After that I do not know what else I should do.

397
01:07:32,848 --> 01:07:44,040
Some students many times have said "when I have a case and I try to find the remedy

398
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:51,119
and I cannot find the remedy I think you will come and tell me the remedy".

399
01:07:53,008 --> 01:08:20,984
I cannot do that. You have a question? I will give you.

400
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:30,312
-About predisposition. Children that are treated with right homeopathic treatment,

401
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:37,967
what are the chances for their children to change the predisposition in a positive way?

402
01:08:39,207 --> 01:08:42,447
And in how long time?

403
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:54,616
-I must say that there is a chance, if the parents were treated correctly

404
01:08:55,295 --> 01:09:01,519
and they had children, that their children will be in better state of health.

405
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:14,944
The problem is that a child who is born does not depend only on the

406
01:09:15,232 --> 01:09:17,760
genetic predisposition of the 2 people.

407
01:09:18,336 --> 01:09:27,296
It depends on other factors; environmental and mostly according to my experience

408
01:09:30,255 --> 01:09:36,079
on the state of health at the moment of conception.

409
01:09:39,136 --> 01:09:49,480
Our state of health goes up and down and if the conception takes place in the best

410
01:09:50,312 --> 01:10:03,144
possible moment of the 2 organisms, the child born can be much greater in health

411
01:10:04,023 --> 01:10:11,975
than the parents. The parent give to the child the best possible, out of the 2.

412
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:21,159
And the child is born which is really complete. You know my theory on children?

413
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:36,400
No, better read the whole theory how children could be born healthy.

414
01:10:37,071 --> 01:10:46,152
I gave this lecture during this course also and there is in my books.

415
01:10:50,264 --> 01:10:58,207
Definitely there is an improvement but very important is the moment of conception.

416
01:11:01,672 --> 01:11:10,361
In a family somebody is really a complete person, not a genius because genius

417
01:11:10,616 --> 01:11:17,408
is different, but complete person, mentally, emotionally, physically, balanced and

418
01:11:19,792 --> 01:11:24,328
you see his brothers and sisters in a terrible state.

419
01:11:26,056 --> 01:11:33,143
That means the two parents were in love, they came and the first child was born

420
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:43,961
beautiful, complete etc. Then they hated each other after 3 years and they start

421
01:11:44,192 --> 01:11:50,063
fighting, they had all kinds of conflicts and the second child is not anymore

422
01:11:50,648 --> 01:11:55,384
as complete as the first one, depending on the health of the moment.

423
01:11:57,344 --> 01:12:05,352
You get a conception the time when the man is drunk, they have sex and the child

424
01:12:06,096 --> 01:12:12,895
will be born with a lot of problems.

425
01:12:19,608 --> 01:12:29,695
-You said several times before the birth of children from diseased parents, teratogenic

426
01:12:29,896 --> 01:12:34,744
factors, whatever who became more or less monsters can kill people, can accept the

427
01:12:34,976 --> 01:12:38,936
killing of people without remorse, without heart, it's clear...

428
01:12:40,079 --> 01:12:49,495
My question is, in the history of the mankind many situations where there were wars

429
01:12:49,912 --> 01:13:03,336
and a ruler gave an order everybody in this town to be killed in that period we expect

430
01:13:03,624 --> 01:13:09,096
them to be healthier people, how is this possible? This is my question.

431
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:20,319
-Particular leaders of these countries like Caligula or Neron were unhealthy,

432
01:13:21,704 --> 01:13:34,344
sick individuals. I cannot investigate their health history.

433
01:13:35,575 --> 01:13:41,903
But definitely they were very sick. Same kind of sickness.

434
01:13:44,912 --> 01:13:57,224
I cannot say what was exactly the sickness they had and how it was treated but

435
01:13:59,104 --> 01:14:11,104
usually such people are coming with diseases which are in relations

436
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:15,687
to their sexual behavior.
