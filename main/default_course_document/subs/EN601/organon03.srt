1
00:00:19,295 --> 00:00:27,326
I just want to say a few things concerning paragraph 9 which we have been discussing

2
00:00:29,114 --> 00:00:40,668
yesterday and I gave you my idea of what is a higher purpose in life.

3
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:46,264
Perhaps this is a misunderstanding.

4
00:00:48,154 --> 00:01:03,454
The highest purpose in life in some people is the spiritual enlightment,

5
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,062
the spiritual progress.

6
00:01:08,872 --> 00:01:16,768
That does not mean that this is the only purpose of the higher self.

7
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:31,350
There are a lot of other noble purposes which each one of us has and tries to attain.

8
00:01:34,055 --> 00:01:40,298
But I said from the higher purpose of attaining of becoming rich,

9
00:01:42,412 --> 00:01:43,202
which is the opposite,

10
00:01:44,923 --> 00:01:52,167
to this other higher purpose, which is the highest spiritual attainment,

11
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,343
there are a lot of other noble, higher purposes in life.

12
00:02:02,145 --> 00:02:17,217
Each one chooses to do. For a woman may be to raise her children properly,

13
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:24,529
devotes all her life into that. That is a higher purpose in life.

14
00:02:30,794 --> 00:02:38,407
For some other people to work on society and social matters.

15
00:02:42,867 --> 00:02:50,761
Even some politicians, very few, they come to politics with the idea

16
00:02:52,886 --> 00:02:58,830
that they will help forming a better society.

17
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:02,311
I didn't want to give the impression that higher purposes of life,

18
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:08,592
as far as we understand it now today, I do not know what Hahnemann meant

19
00:03:11,382 --> 00:03:19,445
but what I mean today that a healthy person should use his abilities

20
00:03:21,116 --> 00:03:25,290
for a higher purpose, to do something beyond himself.

21
00:03:27,095 --> 00:03:35,617
You remember perhaps my definition of health and the measure of health.

22
00:03:36,815 --> 00:03:51,780
Who is healthier than another. And I said, measuring health through creativity.

23
00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:05,548
A person who is creative, who is producing, which bringing in life, new ideas,

24
00:04:07,522 --> 00:04:10,621
new things in life, is a creative person.

25
00:04:12,536 --> 00:04:16,502
The only difference is between somebody who is selfish and somebody

26
00:04:17,593 --> 00:04:24,727
who is healthy is that what he does for himself should be also in,

27
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:35,729
half actually, in favor of society as well. What I do if I do it with the purpose

28
00:04:37,114 --> 00:04:44,107
of helping society, as much as I'm helping myself, I am in a very correct,

29
00:04:45,429 --> 00:04:47,464
good health condition.

30
00:04:51,625 --> 00:05:03,977
If I go one way like discarding myself and don't care about myself, only society...

31
00:05:05,969 --> 00:05:10,103
this is not healthy.

32
00:05:12,344 --> 00:05:16,101
In the same way, if I go, everything for myself...

33
00:05:18,093 --> 00:05:24,321
whatever I do, the purpose is to gain myself, forget the society.

34
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:34,510
They can die. I can sell my country, if I am a politician in order to make

35
00:05:36,386 --> 00:05:44,880
some billions in my account, that is a very unhealthy condition.

36
00:05:46,573 --> 00:05:52,554
You may say "But these people, they live long". It doesn't matter.

37
00:05:55,796 --> 00:06:04,506
It's not a matter of how long someone lives but what is the quality of life they have.

38
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:13,640
So the quality of life counts very much. In order to have a good quality of life,

39
00:06:14,977 --> 00:06:21,343
you have to have a balance. And also you have to have as little as possible

40
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:37,680
dark areas in your deep subconscious.

41
00:06:45,586 --> 00:06:47,454
You understand what it means.

42
00:06:51,958 --> 00:07:02,801
So in paragraph 10, Hahnemann says "The material organism,

43
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:14,088
without the vital force, is capable of no sensation, no function, no self-preservation,

44
00:07:15,984 --> 00:07:23,844
it derives all sensation and performs all the functions of life solely by means

45
00:07:25,176 --> 00:07:29,664
of the immaterial being (the vital principle) which animates

46
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:34,553
the material organism in health and in disease".

47
00:07:37,067 --> 00:07:43,157
So this is his main argument. He says, what is the difference between a corpse,

48
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:53,428
a person who has just died, what is the difference of that condition and

49
00:07:54,373 --> 00:08:01,946
the condition 3 minutes before? What is missing?

50
00:08:05,211 --> 00:08:14,086
1,2,3 seconds before the death and after the death... What is the difference?

51
00:08:20,398 --> 00:08:24,996
That the organism or one organ gave in or something like that? Not really.

52
00:08:26,613 --> 00:08:33,489
The difference is that this vital principle, this energy body which keeps the life

53
00:08:36,126 --> 00:08:43,185
of a person and gives the possibility of a human being to function,

54
00:08:45,896 --> 00:08:51,604
it is this energy body, he's talking about a new concept in Medicine,

55
00:08:56,291 --> 00:09:04,864
which was going to be realized and to be understood a few centuries later.

56
00:09:07,023 --> 00:09:16,368
That when we want to cure somebody we have to take into consideration

57
00:09:17,233 --> 00:09:21,496
the functioning of this energy body.

58
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:42,042
So it is his biggest argument actually. "[...]The material organism without the

59
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:53,185
vital force, is capable of no sensation, no function, no self-preservation",

60
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:03,866
what keeps the organism rejuvenating all the time. It is this energy body.

61
00:10:08,138 --> 00:10:17,013
In paragraph 11 says "When a person falls ill, it is only this spiritual,

62
00:10:18,304 --> 00:10:26,121
self acting (automatic) vital force..." You see he struggles with different words

63
00:10:27,112 --> 00:10:34,655
to define what this vital principle is, vital energy, energy body etc.

64
00:10:36,304 --> 00:10:42,206
"[...]everywhere present in his organism, that is primarily deranged by

65
00:10:42,992 --> 00:10:47,864
the dynamic influence upon it of a morbific agent inimical to life"

66
00:10:50,557 --> 00:10:55,709
and he is really a forerunner.

67
00:10:56,105 --> 00:11:03,458
Cellier much later said that the stress of life, he had written a whole book about

68
00:11:04,704 --> 00:11:10,402
The stress... What is the stress in life? Is it something material, some stone

69
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:16,576
that hits you on the head? No, we don't call this a stress. We call it an accident.

70
00:11:19,818 --> 00:11:34,590
A stress is an immaterial attack upon what? Since it is an immaterial attack,

71
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,684
it is going to attack something immaterial in the body.

72
00:11:40,998 --> 00:11:43,293
It is not going to attack something material.

73
00:11:48,014 --> 00:11:57,208
When somebody gives you an information, which is really valid for you

74
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:05,931
and it is very important, you listen somebody on the phone and says

75
00:12:06,635 --> 00:12:09,808
"Your son..." immediately you are aware.

76
00:12:11,406 --> 00:12:22,193
"Your son, he was in the football game...", you start trembling "...

77
00:12:24,048 --> 00:12:31,434
and unfortunately they stepped down and he's in the hospital".

78
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:43,117
What is this shock? Is it a material shock? Where has an effect? Upon what?

79
00:12:44,749 --> 00:12:50,026
What is the substratum upon which this stress has an effect?

80
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:58,996
You may say emotions. Yes, but emotions are becoming alive,

81
00:13:00,841 --> 00:13:08,182
sensations are becoming alive because of the vital principle, because of the energy.

82
00:13:08,382 --> 00:13:16,209
So behind the emotions and the thinking and the moving and the function

83
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:22,906
is a substratum, which Hahnemann called "vital force".

84
00:13:24,651 --> 00:13:29,657
And then it was a whole movement "the vitalism" and then they rejected

85
00:13:30,991 --> 00:13:34,648
the vitalism and became the materialism.

86
00:13:36,295 --> 00:13:40,564
They said vitalism is nothing, we have to see everything.

87
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:46,784
What do we have to see? Do you see the stress? Do you see anything?

88
00:13:48,108 --> 00:13:55,644
Is there any possibility for anyone to observe a stress on a human being?

89
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:18,544
So he says this material body is "[...] primarily deranged by the dynamic

90
00:14:19,977 --> 00:14:30,198
influence upon it of a morbific agent inimical to life".

91
00:14:34,204 --> 00:14:43,571
So the whole idea of the stress and how it is transferred into the organism

92
00:14:44,642 --> 00:14:51,953
and through the vital principle or the energy, always remember there is

93
00:14:52,823 --> 00:14:59,729
a substratum, an energy body, which is affected primarily and then

94
00:15:00,722 --> 00:15:09,945
this shock is distributed to the 3 levels. Mental, emotional, physical.

95
00:15:13,897 --> 00:15:21,953
Depending this stress, depending where it will have the worst damage

96
00:15:23,735 --> 00:15:28,885
in the person, depending on the genetic predisposition of his organism.

97
00:15:30,367 --> 00:15:34,193
If genetically he is mentally weak, it will derange his mind,

98
00:15:35,605 --> 00:15:45,952
will make the mother or the woman out of her mind. I lost my child.

99
00:15:55,904 --> 00:15:52,001
If there is a predisposition towards mental derangement.

100
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:59,445
If the predisposition is in the heart, she will have a heart attack.

101
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:05,396
If the predisposition is in the alimentary canal, will have a colitis,

102
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:11,872
next day she starts with pains in the abdomen and eventually

103
00:16:13,436 --> 00:16:15,378
an ulcerative colitis develops.

104
00:16:18,502 --> 00:16:24,339
We accept that the shock is totally an immaterial thing,

105
00:16:25,643 --> 00:16:34,873
which receives the organism and we do not accept that the shock is perceived

106
00:16:36,671 --> 00:16:38,511
by an equally immaterial agent.

107
00:16:50,985 --> 00:16:59,798
This is a way of describing the energy body which keeps up alive.

108
00:17:09,269 --> 00:17:14,515
"[...]it is only the vital principle, deranged to such an abnormal state

109
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:20,520
that can furnish the organism with its disagreeable sensations

110
00:17:22,044 --> 00:17:26,122
and incline it to the irregular processes which we call disease".

111
00:17:30,687 --> 00:17:42,096
So therefore he says most of the diseases are immaterial attacks

112
00:17:43,533 --> 00:17:53,263
upon the human organism and the receiver is the vital principle.

113
00:17:58,871 --> 00:18:05,800
"[...]for as a power invisible in itself and only cognizable by its effects on the organism,

114
00:18:07,808 --> 00:18:13,165
its morbid derangement only makes itself known by the manifestation of disease

115
00:18:14,425 --> 00:18:17,551
in the sensation and functions of those parts of the organism

116
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:24,302
exposed to the senses of the observer and physician, that is by morbid symptoms

117
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:29,141
and in no other way can it make itself known".

118
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:38,750
Hahnemann makes very long sentences. Maybe you will have a problem reading

119
00:18:40,472 --> 00:18:52,788
but what he says is that this stress makes itself known only through symptoms.

120
00:18:54,038 --> 00:19:01,405
If you receive a stress and for a time-being you have a shock but you overcome it,

121
00:19:02,598 --> 00:19:03,994
there's no problem.

122
00:19:08,451 --> 00:19:19,056
If they tell you whatever but you are in a position to resist or to handle that shock,

123
00:19:20,573 --> 00:19:22,409
nothing happens. There's no problem.

124
00:19:23,949 --> 00:19:30,845
He says if this shock creates problems in sensations and functions,

125
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:43,878
in feelings and in the function of the organs, then it produces symptoms.

126
00:19:45,306 --> 00:19:51,039
These symptoms are the problem, are the disease. Very simple.

127
00:19:52,827 --> 00:19:59,816
He repeats perhaps too much in order to make his point clear.

128
00:20:01,358 --> 00:20:03,836
He repeats the same idea again and again.

129
00:20:07,746 --> 00:20:25,057
In parag.12 "It is the morbidly affected vital energy alone that produces disease".

130
00:20:30,242 --> 00:20:38,880
So he says, the beginning of all diseases starts in the energy body.

131
00:20:48,473 --> 00:20:53,322
"[...]so that the morbid phenomena perceptible to our senses express

132
00:20:54,417 --> 00:20:57,794
at the same time all the internal change, that is to say, the whole

133
00:20:59,045 --> 00:21:03,083
morbid derangement of the internal dynamis".

134
00:21:05,824 --> 00:21:15,878
"[...]so that the morbid phenomena", the symptoms which are expressed

135
00:21:17,217 --> 00:21:25,373
and we perceive them, indicate all the internal changes that have happened

136
00:21:26,657 --> 00:21:28,673
in the organism.

137
00:21:35,534 --> 00:21:39,020
"[...]in a word, they reveal the whole disease..."

138
00:21:43,142 --> 00:21:56,638
His mode of thinking, his strategy is to tell us that what is the manifestation

139
00:21:57,639 --> 00:22:04,476
of the disease, which starts from a shock, from an effect on the vital force,

140
00:22:07,264 --> 00:22:16,180
it is only the symptoms perceptible to the person, to his people around

141
00:22:17,585 --> 00:22:19,888
and to the observer. This is all.

142
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:28,622
Because he wants to bring up the idea of similars eventually

143
00:22:31,121 --> 00:22:41,619
He prepares you to perceive and tries again and again to tell you that

144
00:22:42,656 --> 00:22:52,338
the derangement of the organism means automatically expression in signs

145
00:22:53,525 --> 00:23:02,541
and symptoms. Later on we will say how this can be alleviated.

146
00:23:09,739 --> 00:23:13,372
"[...]also, the disappearance under treatment of all the morbid phenomena

147
00:23:14,707 --> 00:23:18,377
and all the morbid alterations that differ from the healthy vital operations,

148
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:24,319
certainly affects and necessarily implies the restoration of the integrity

149
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,506
of the vital force..."

150
00:23:29,479 --> 00:23:36,596
If you take away the symptoms, you have certainly brought back health.

151
00:23:37,951 --> 00:23:42,820
This is his idea. "[...]therefore, the recovered health of the whole body".

152
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:45,938
The organism has recovered.

153
00:23:47,941 --> 00:23:57,744
And in 13 "Therefore disease (that does not come within the province of

154
00:23:59,024 --> 00:24:11,084
manual surgery) considered, as it is by the allopathists, as a thing separate from

155
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:18,328
the living whole, from the organism and its animating vital force,

156
00:24:20,089 --> 00:24:28,600
hidden in the interior, be it ever so subtle a character, is an absurdity,

157
00:24:29,963 --> 00:24:37,784
that could only be imagined by minds of a materialistic stamp, and has

158
00:24:39,305 --> 00:24:44,024
for thousands of years given to the prevailing system of Medicine

159
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:48,610
all those pernicious impulses that have made it a truly mischievous

160
00:24:49,746 --> 00:24:54,157
(non-healing) art".

161
00:25:00,021 --> 00:25:06,099
He expresses the idea of his time, of what they thought to be a disease.

162
00:25:07,626 --> 00:25:13,730
In those times the idea was that a disease is something separate from the organism.

163
00:25:14,933 --> 00:25:18,583
A disease has entered my organism, so I can take it out.

164
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,538
This was the idea of the time.

165
00:25:27,914 --> 00:25:34,161
So, we have a healthy organism, suddenly a disease, an entity, has entered

166
00:25:35,564 --> 00:25:39,377
my organism and now we have to find a way to take it out.

167
00:25:40,682 --> 00:25:46,593
And how to take it out, most probably, the blood is the best way to take it out.

168
00:25:48,292 --> 00:25:53,979
So draw blood to take out the entity of the disease.

169
00:25:58,322 --> 00:26:02,856
He says, all this is absolutely nonsense.

170
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:12,932
Because the disease and the organism is now one and the same, of course.

171
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:20,172
It is the organism that has become diseased through the morbific,

172
00:26:22,566 --> 00:26:29,191
inimical influence from the environment.

173
00:26:37,042 --> 00:26:48,059
In paragraph 14 "There is, in the interior of man, nothing morbid that is curable

174
00:26:49,215 --> 00:26:54,834
and no visible morbid alteration that is curable which does not make itself

175
00:26:55,757 --> 00:27:02,057
known to the accurately observing physicians by means of morbid signs

176
00:27:03,591 --> 00:27:09,177
and symptoms - an arrangement in perfect conformity with the infinite goodness

177
00:27:10,533 --> 00:27:14,192
of all-wise Preserver of human life".

178
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:23,930
Here he says, there is nothing inside the organism which is separate

179
00:27:25,993 --> 00:27:35,333
and the disease will make itself manifested with signs and symptoms

180
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,505
and arrangement.

181
00:27:48,853 --> 00:27:51,597
You have to realize also something else about Hahnemann.

182
00:27:53,244 --> 00:28:01,784
He's a man of vision, a man of perception who discovers things and

183
00:28:02,843 --> 00:28:05,491
discovery is fantastic. It's tremendous what he finds out.

184
00:28:07,077 --> 00:28:12,266
He finds out that all these nonsense they tell people, the disease as an entity

185
00:28:14,018 --> 00:28:16,385
which has entered and I have to take it out... all this is nonsence.

186
00:28:18,379 --> 00:28:26,212
What I realize is that there is an impact upon the organism, the organism reacts

187
00:28:28,148 --> 00:28:36,260
with signs and symptoms and this is one thing, the organism and the disease now.

188
00:28:37,463 --> 00:28:48,297
There is no separation. He realizes that all this is an arrangement that has been

189
00:28:49,948 --> 00:29:02,532
done by the higher spirit, the "all-wise Preserver of human life".

190
00:29:08,823 --> 00:29:20,099
This is a deep belief in God. He realizes like all people who discover

191
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:35,734
something essential in life... they come to believe that this complicated world

192
00:29:36,629 --> 00:29:40,521
in which we live is not possible to be accidental.

193
00:29:42,345 --> 00:29:54,585
Something is creating it and there is some power, some spirit

194
00:29:57,375 --> 00:30:04,723
which is beyond our comprehension and that we will never understand

195
00:30:05,874 --> 00:30:20,313
exactly what's going on. There is a power beyond which arranges all this,

196
00:30:22,842 --> 00:30:31,264
there is a kind of harmony which cannot be accidental.

197
00:30:33,213 --> 00:30:48,442
It is arranged by an all-wise Preserver of life. He gives in a way his understanding.

198
00:30:50,484 --> 00:30:56,172
He says "I've discovered this. But I cannot explain it.

199
00:30:58,043 --> 00:31:07,512
There is some higher power which is arranging that. I don't know what it is".

200
00:31:22,812 --> 00:31:36,616
I'm sorry. Some of you may be materialists and you may disagree.

201
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:49,701
I'm trying to give you the spirit of Hahnemann, the understanding of Hahneman,

202
00:31:51,484 --> 00:31:54,897
the knowledge of Hahnaman. I'm not going to teach you about God...

203
00:31:57,775 --> 00:32:07,585
Allah is better than this or that... Cabala is better than the Bible etc.

204
00:32:10,369 --> 00:32:18,734
I know you are from different beliefs. I'm trying to give you the understanding

205
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,673
of Hahnemann and what he writes here.

206
00:32:24,508 --> 00:32:27,327
Whether we like it or not, this is what he says.

207
00:32:31,374 --> 00:32:41,039
He says in paragraph 15, "The affection of the morbidly deranged,

208
00:32:42,395 --> 00:32:47,564
spirit-like dynamis (vital force) that animates our body in the invisible interior

209
00:32:49,147 --> 00:32:56,695
and the totality of the outwardly cognizable symptoms produced by it

210
00:32:58,137 --> 00:33:05,521
in the organism and representing the existing malady, constitute a whole and

211
00:33:08,542 --> 00:33:11,190
they are one and the same."

212
00:33:14,453 --> 00:33:23,383
The same idea, all the symptoms which are produced in a morbidly

213
00:33:24,963 --> 00:33:35,607
deranged organism, they are not separate from the organism.

214
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:43,394
The organism and the malady, the disease are together.

215
00:33:49,058 --> 00:33:56,443
"[...]The organism is indeed the material instrument of the life, but it is not

216
00:33:57,854 --> 00:34:07,173
conceivable without the animation imparted to it by the instinctively perceiving

217
00:34:08,423 --> 00:34:13,643
and regulating dynamis (just as the vital force is not conceivable without the

218
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:21,329
organism), consequently the two together constitute a unity, although in thought

219
00:34:23,114 --> 00:34:29,728
our mind separates this unity into two distinct conceptions

220
00:34:30,747 --> 00:34:36,400
for the sake of easing the comprehension of it".

221
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:48,474
The disease and the organism are together. What we do is separate the one

222
00:34:49,347 --> 00:34:55,907
from the other for the sake of understanding better. Disease is now this.

223
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:03,119
What he means is the totality of symptoms.

224
00:35:09,786 --> 00:35:14,722
He's very accurate in his expression and he is meticulous and he wants to make

225
00:35:16,381 --> 00:35:19,005
his point very clear. "That is why".

226
00:35:20,308 --> 00:35:25,748
He repeats again and again the whole idea, so it can be understood very well

227
00:35:26,742 --> 00:35:31,179
because it is a new idea that brings to the world.

228
00:35:33,235 --> 00:35:38,958
How could he pass it into the consciousness of the people?

229
00:35:42,832 --> 00:35:47,231
He feels he needs to give all the arguments.

230
00:35:56,829 --> 00:36:00,597
If you have a question about anything, you can ask me.

231
00:36:10,985 --> 00:36:17,267
Par. 16, "Our vital force, as a spirit-like dynamis, cannot be attacked

232
00:36:18,913 --> 00:36:21,245
and affected by injurious influences on the healthy organism caused

233
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:28,838
by the external inimical forces that disturb the harmonious play of life,

234
00:36:30,949 --> 00:36:36,026
otherwise than in a spirit-like (dynamic) way". It's the same idea.

235
00:36:37,282 --> 00:36:49,789
You cannot affect this dynamic body which is inside us, the energy body,

236
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:57,767
but with equally dynamic influence.

237
00:37:06,765 --> 00:37:09,778
If you want to affect a stone, can you affect it with air?

238
00:37:11,442 --> 00:37:18,194
You have to have another stone to affect it. So he drives to the idea of similarities.

239
00:37:19,943 --> 00:37:25,077
Then eventually he will say how can you affect this dynamic plane,

240
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:32,590
you have to have a dynamic instrument to affect it.

241
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:37,178
This is where he is driving to.

242
00:37:45,072 --> 00:37:50,733
"[...]and in like manner, all such morbid derangements (diseases) cannot

243
00:37:52,347 --> 00:37:56,620
be removed from it by the physician in any other way than by a dynamic

244
00:37:59,655 --> 00:38:07,573
alternative power of the serviceable medicines, acting upon our spirit-like vital force"

245
00:38:09,782 --> 00:38:15,052
You cannot remove this problem that was caused by a dynamic influence

246
00:38:16,238 --> 00:38:24,169
upon the organism but only through another dynamic means.

247
00:38:29,021 --> 00:38:33,852
"[...]which perceives them through the medium of the sentient faculty

248
00:38:35,195 --> 00:38:40,759
of the nerves everywhere present in the organism, so that it is only by their

249
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:46,056
dynamic action on the vital force that remedies are able to re-establish

250
00:38:48,167 --> 00:38:51,769
and do actually re-establish health and vital harmony

251
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:59,512
after the changes in the health of the patient cognizable by our senses

252
00:39:01,476 --> 00:39:03,902
(the totality of the symptoms) have revealed the disease to the carefully

253
00:39:05,808 --> 00:39:10,819
observing and investigating physician as fully as was requisite in order to enable

254
00:39:12,513 --> 00:39:17,747
him to cure it". It's very long process. It's very simple.

255
00:39:19,738 --> 00:39:27,965
He says this vital derangement of the organism can be cured only through

256
00:39:29,286 --> 00:39:32,262
another vital effect upon the organism.

257
00:39:40,752 --> 00:39:47,848
Par.17, "Now, as in the cure effected by the removal of the whole of

258
00:39:48,525 --> 00:39:52,902
the perceptible signs and symptoms of the disease, the internal alteration

259
00:39:54,043 --> 00:40:01,386
of the vital principle to which the disease is due - consequently the whole

260
00:40:03,424 --> 00:40:08,105
of the disease - is at the same time removed, it follows that the physician

261
00:40:09,545 --> 00:40:14,136
has only to remove the whole of the symptoms in order, at the same time,

262
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:19,742
to abrogate and annihilate the internal change, that is to say,

263
00:40:21,637 --> 00:40:26,102
the morbid derangement of the vital force - consequently the totality of

264
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,117
the disease, the disease itself".

265
00:40:32,328 --> 00:40:37,169
He hammers the same point again and again.

266
00:40:38,931 --> 00:40:44,223
He says that now the only thing you have to do is through a dynamic influence

267
00:40:46,088 --> 00:40:53,459
to bring back the harmony of the already deranged vital force.

268
00:40:56,070 --> 00:41:04,973
"[...]But when the disease is annihilated, health is restored and this is the highest,

269
00:41:06,581 --> 00:41:10,483
the sole aim of the physician who knows the true object of his mission,

270
00:41:12,652 --> 00:41:19,995
which consists not in learned - sounding prating but in giving aid to the sick".

271
00:41:26,137 --> 00:41:30,911
Hahnemann always had strict morality in his teachings.

272
00:41:38,826 --> 00:41:46,698
He was a very conservative man with a brain that would open up to new ideas

273
00:41:51,042 --> 00:42:04,319
and he realizes that if a physician has to understand really what he says and

274
00:42:09,476 --> 00:42:17,292
apply it must also have an open mind and clean character.

275
00:42:22,302 --> 00:42:26,741
He says "the highest, the sole aim of the physician".

276
00:42:28,173 --> 00:42:34,304
That means in order to understand and to cure, your soul must be pure.

277
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:41,018
"[...] who knows the true object of his mission" you see again and again

278
00:42:42,004 --> 00:42:48,537
he considers the work of the physician as a mission.

279
00:42:56,518 --> 00:42:59,534
And this is not just prating and words.

280
00:43:01,932 --> 00:43:09,637
Parag.18, "From this indubitable truth, that besides the totality of the symptoms

281
00:43:11,565 --> 00:43:17,662
with consideration of the accompanying modalities (par. 5), nothing can by any means

282
00:43:19,005 --> 00:43:25,124
be discovered in disease wherewith they could express their need of aid,

283
00:43:26,086 --> 00:43:31,955
it follows undeniably that the sum of all the symptoms and conditions in such

284
00:43:32,698 --> 00:43:40,628
individual case of disease, must be the sole indication, the sole guide to direct us

285
00:43:41,998 --> 00:43:43,508
in the choice of a remedy".

286
00:43:49,275 --> 00:43:54,958
Nothing but the totality of the symptoms should guide you to find the remedy.

287
00:43:56,914 --> 00:43:58,350
It's very simple.

288
00:44:15,626 --> 00:44:20,929
- Also in the first paragraphs he says if you deal with the symptoms, then you deal

289
00:44:22,073 --> 00:44:26,104
with the disease. So here I struggle with the concept of latent disease,

290
00:44:27,617 --> 00:44:34,549
latent psora, latent sycosis. You can't see it but it's there.

291
00:44:36,096 --> 00:44:39,876
So what are the symptoms there? What do we do when we know there is a disease

292
00:44:41,294 --> 00:44:42,604
and we can't see it?

293
00:44:44,218 --> 00:44:46,157
-When there is a disease and we cannot see it?

294
00:44:47,223 --> 00:44:51,658
- If Hahnemann says when there is disease, it makes itself known through symptoms.

295
00:44:53,194 --> 00:44:55,387
So I struggle with the concept of latent disease.

296
00:44:58,101 --> 00:45:06,095
-This is something which was not prevalent during these times.

297
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:14,522
This time human organisms were much more healthy belonging to the uppermost

298
00:45:15,348 --> 00:45:21,076
level, as we said, and therefore feeling healthy.

299
00:45:21,897 --> 00:45:24,719
If somebody was not healthy, an epidemic came and killed him.

300
00:45:25,643 --> 00:45:30,357
And there was, what we call, a natural selection.

301
00:45:31,447 --> 00:45:40,258
We, as human beings, managed to bypass this natural selection by doing what?

302
00:45:42,013 --> 00:45:50,259
By interfering into the immune system of the organism and rearrange it

303
00:45:52,669 --> 00:46:01,880
in such a way that you feel or you are in a condition where you don't feel

304
00:46:02,965 --> 00:46:09,824
symptoms but actually your basic constitution has been undermined.

305
00:46:14,057 --> 00:46:22,897
That concept that we have today was not prevalent during that time.

306
00:46:26,427 --> 00:46:38,582
A latent condition today means that the hereditary predisposition of the person

307
00:46:39,849 --> 00:46:45,426
is of a precarious state.

308
00:46:52,556 --> 00:46:57,629
And with any shock, it could flare up and kill the person.

309
00:46:59,827 --> 00:47:07,712
We have undermined our constitution so much that we have created this idea

310
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:17,270
of latent conditions that can flare up at any time,

311
00:47:19,259 --> 00:47:24,690
under some kind of stress to which we are sensitive to.

312
00:47:26,406 --> 00:47:41,775
Now you will say, why not? We did quite well as a society using the attainments,

313
00:47:44,821 --> 00:47:57,057
using the discoveries of Medicine. What is the problem?

314
00:47:59,904 --> 00:48:10,259
And why do we say today that there are Levels of Health and these kind of things?

315
00:48:15,829 --> 00:48:24,786
The problem that we have created for ourselves is

316
00:48:26,411 --> 00:48:36,187
that by interfering on the immune system, what we say to the immune system

317
00:48:37,203 --> 00:48:50,477
"don't be affected by this agent, by streptococcus, scarlet fever, epidemics..."

318
00:48:53,132 --> 00:48:57,499
And we have found a way to manipulate the immune system,

319
00:48:58,135 --> 00:49:00,522
so it cannot be affected by this.

320
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:12,191
You have to remember that for every change that we manage to obtain

321
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:19,943
on the immune system, there is a change of the whole constitution,

322
00:49:21,397 --> 00:49:30,447
which cannot be obvious like you took a vaccination and immediately

323
00:49:31,231 --> 00:49:33,794
after the 4th, 5th day you paralyzes.

324
00:49:34,802 --> 00:49:43,676
You took vaccination and then after a week you had a kidney damage.

325
00:49:46,142 --> 00:49:53,658
You took this vaccination and you had a kind of mental derangement.

326
00:49:55,893 --> 00:50:00,605
Autistic or psychotic problems etc.

327
00:50:03,833 --> 00:50:13,625
The idea that there is such a side effect on the human organism

328
00:50:14,875 --> 00:50:19,136
because of the interference with the vaccination.

329
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:28,766
The fact that there is obviously certain people even reach death after the vaccination.

330
00:50:29,769 --> 00:50:32,374
We have these statistics, we know how many are reaching death,

331
00:50:33,122 --> 00:50:36,779
how many had side effects. Nobody denies that.

332
00:50:39,485 --> 00:50:47,533
What we don't realize is that everyone who takes a vaccination has a change

333
00:50:48,653 --> 00:50:56,485
either bigger or lesser. Everyone. What is that change?

334
00:51:00,729 --> 00:51:14,527
That change cannot be always attributed to a certain organ.

335
00:51:15,836 --> 00:51:19,259
If you take this vaccination, your liver will be affected. No.

336
00:51:21,931 --> 00:51:28,227
But the interference brings about a change of the whole organism.

337
00:51:29,558 --> 00:51:34,677
That change of the whole organism is distributed on the whole organism.

338
00:51:38,796 --> 00:51:46,963
And it can produce mild or subtle changes that are not obvious.

339
00:51:48,285 --> 00:51:52,763
So they say "I took the vaccination and I had no side effects". This is not so.

340
00:51:52,963 --> 00:52:00,653
The side effects were there. What was the side effect? The side effect could have been

341
00:52:02,034 --> 00:52:10,253
even that you wake up in the morning and you were very happy seeing the sun,

342
00:52:10,925 --> 00:52:23,661
now you are not so happy. This little thing which took away a little bit of joy of life.

343
00:52:25,024 --> 00:52:33,850
This little thing is very important for the organism, it's very vital.

344
00:52:35,826 --> 00:52:42,085
If you lose this, you start entering the world of diseases.

345
00:52:43,203 --> 00:52:53,073
But now you say, "I have no problem, Ok, I lost a little bit of joy or I lost this or that...

346
00:52:54,552 --> 00:53:08,991
I don't have symptoms". In reality you have started with an undermining

347
00:53:10,235 --> 00:53:15,658
of the organ which has a predisposition due to your hereditary.

348
00:53:17,177 --> 00:53:19,893
When it's your brain, it will be your brain. When it is liver, it will be the liver.

349
00:53:21,492 --> 00:53:25,043
When there is the kidneys, it will be the kidneys or the lungs.

350
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:34,035
But it has undermined your hereditary weakness and has progressed it

351
00:53:35,047 --> 00:53:37,422
towards breaking down.

352
00:53:42,197 --> 00:53:48,482
If there is a hereditary mental problem, you will have an autistic child.

353
00:53:54,955 --> 00:53:59,537
If there is a predisposition for the heart, you will have a heart problem at

354
00:54:01,353 --> 00:54:13,320
10,15,20 years but it has started since the time you introduced this vaccination.

355
00:54:19,562 --> 00:54:29,656
The idea of "I am healthy" today is a very relative concept.

356
00:54:32,032 --> 00:54:41,212
When you examine a patient, you say "How many hours in your life you are happy?"

357
00:54:44,042 --> 00:54:47,461
He answers "Who is happy?"

358
00:54:55,057 --> 00:55:00,799
Compare the state of your patients with the state of the children.

359
00:55:05,722 --> 00:55:07,822
Very happy all the time.

360
00:55:08,022 --> 00:55:20,735
Now, these children have been vaccinated and eventually this happiness

361
00:55:22,449 --> 00:55:29,480
will not remain, will be taken away slowly. No symptoms. We call it no symptoms.

362
00:55:31,259 --> 00:55:40,303
But there are symptoms and there are indications for us to understand that

363
00:55:41,489 --> 00:55:50,807
there is a possibility of a breaking down of some organ in the organism.

364
00:55:52,505 --> 00:55:56,683
Why is the child always happy?

365
00:55:58,997 --> 00:56:06,539
And why this happiness is almost totally gone, as you grow up?

366
00:56:09,776 --> 00:56:16,017
Another example.

367
00:56:24,052 --> 00:56:38,541
We have in the earth primitive tribes, who never had any vaccination,

368
00:56:40,983 --> 00:56:46,040
 they are living in the Amazon, they used to live in Africa.

369
00:56:50,244 --> 00:56:53,494
If you have seen these people, perhaps you have seen documentaries,

370
00:56:55,837 --> 00:57:03,328
how happy they are and how easily are happy with little things.

371
00:57:04,826 --> 00:57:09,557
They dance, they laugh, they enjoy.

372
00:57:10,891 --> 00:57:19,776
Why are we in such a bad mood and we can't enjoy as much as they do?

373
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:36,679
They don't enjoy through sex because our enjoyment is mostly sex and drinks.

374
00:57:45,716 --> 00:57:51,695
I become drunk and I am happy. They don't. What's the difference?

375
00:57:52,556 --> 00:58:01,330
If we vaccinate all these people, they will lose eventually their joy of life.

376
00:58:02,038 --> 00:58:14,862
That losing of joy of life is the result of our generations having what we call

377
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:28,761
a latent state of disease. The disease is lurking under and is ready to flare up.

378
00:58:42,804 --> 00:58:52,253
During this time of Hahnemann I expect most of the people were in a kind

379
00:58:53,041 --> 00:59:05,431
of a primitive state. They were quite happy in spite of the fact they were poorer,

380
00:59:06,612 --> 00:59:19,400
they had less automobiles... much less possibilities than we have.

381
00:59:20,425 --> 00:59:28,042
Happiness is not depending on how much we are having, it's an inner state.

382
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:37,196
So interfere with your inner state with chemical drugs and

383
00:59:37,801 --> 00:59:40,291
you will destroy the harmony.

384
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:53,866
And then you produce more and more organisms which have a predisposition

385
00:59:54,688 --> 00:59:59,542
to be affected by any kind of stress.

386
01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:09,217
We are living today in a constant state of stress. How can we enjoy?

387
01:00:10,841 --> 01:00:17,847
Why have we arrived in this state? What is the real reason?

388
01:00:19,596 --> 01:00:26,331
The reason is that we have treated the organism wrongly, not with Homeopathy.

389
01:00:32,385 --> 01:00:36,986
You may say "Ok, what do you suggest? We don't vaccinate."

390
01:00:38,506 --> 01:00:44,702
It is too late. Either you vaccinate or you don't vaccinate you ancestors have given

391
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:49,594
you a constitution which is not really healthy.

392
01:00:51,312 --> 01:01:03,822
On top of that you are vaccinated, so how many hours of your life you are happy?

393
01:01:05,321 --> 01:01:22,305
Very few. This lack of joy, we do not consider it as a symptom because

394
01:01:23,614 --> 01:01:30,248
we don't perceive it as such. We attribute it to mode of life, to the social condition,

395
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:36,108
I don't have money, I'm in a bad mood, I don't have a car,

396
01:01:37,563 --> 01:01:43,397
I need a car and I don't have one... This is not true.

397
01:01:45,302 --> 01:01:51,167
People could be happy without anything.

398
01:01:52,770 --> 01:01:58,244
I lived in India and I have seen the poorest people on Earth

399
01:01:59,537 --> 01:02:04,010
according to my understanding in the 1960s

400
01:02:06,871 --> 01:02:13,044
and you would see the children and the people so happy!

401
01:02:16,375 --> 01:02:20,874
I was amazed to see that happiness in their eyes!

402
01:02:21,907 --> 01:02:33,993
I was thinking "How can I go back to Europe and see these sad faces?"

403
01:02:35,577 --> 01:02:44,441
You look around and you see sad faces all the time. You are living in happy people.

404
01:02:49,144 --> 01:03:00,861
Very happy! I gave him a rupee. But he is happy whether I give him the rupee or not.

405
01:03:03,701 --> 01:03:08,068
Before he was happy, after that he expressed his happiness.

406
01:03:09,526 --> 01:03:12,061
All the time he is playful.

407
01:03:19,299 --> 01:03:26,064
Last time I was in India it was 2000, about 40 years later.

408
01:03:27,126 --> 01:03:30,265
It was a different situation.

409
01:03:30,794 --> 01:03:38,489
A lot of vaccination of course and a lot of treatment with chemical drugs.

410
01:03:41,590 --> 01:03:49,409
I saw the same degenerative signs that I had observed in Europe.

411
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:59,349
These are facts that I don't know how to change but these are facts.

412
01:04:11,694 --> 01:04:17,927
"Now, as diseases are nothing more than alterations in the state of health

413
01:04:24,195 --> 01:04:26,558
of the healthy individual which express themselves by morbid signs

414
01:04:30,475 --> 01:04:34,723
and the cure is also only possible by a change to the healthy condition of the state

415
01:04:35,499 --> 01:04:38,766
of health of the diseased individual,

416
01:04:39,829 --> 01:04:45,010
it is very evident that medicines could never cure diseases,

417
01:04:46,262 --> 01:04:51,900
if they did not possess the power of altering man's state of health,

418
01:04:53,838 --> 01:04:57,636
which depends on sensations and functions.

419
01:04:58,443 --> 01:05:06,991
Indeed, their curative power must be owing solely to this power they possess

420
01:05:07,934 --> 01:05:10,339
of altering man's state of health".

421
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:26,435
Since diseases are changes in the state of health, if we want to cure diseases

422
01:05:27,671 --> 01:05:39,218
we should find a tool that can change the state of the health of the people.

423
01:05:47,990 --> 01:06:04,190
Indeed in reality the curative power of the remedies must depend exclusively

424
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:10,377
to this power that possess of altering man's state of health.

425
01:06:13,549 --> 01:06:21,965
He introduces the idea of provings. He says disease changes the state of health.

426
01:06:24,362 --> 01:06:27,797
Remedies change the state of health.

427
01:06:31,545 --> 01:06:39,323
That means the remedy that could alleviate the symptoms must have the possibility

428
01:06:42,045 --> 01:06:45,069
to change the state of health, like a disease.

429
01:06:46,791 --> 01:06:51,653
Disease has the power to change. Remedies must have the power to change

430
01:06:53,182 --> 01:06:55,412
the state of health.

431
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:00,225
He introduces the idea of proving.

432
01:07:02,447 --> 01:07:05,209
"[...]This spirit-like power to alter man's state of health (and hence to cure diseases)

433
01:07:05,781 --> 01:07:12,840
which lies hidden in the inner nature of medicines, can in itself never be discovered

434
01:07:13,340 --> 01:07:24,458
by us by a mere effort of reason; it is only by experience of the phenomena,

435
01:07:25,581 --> 01:07:31,685
it displays when acting on the state of health of man that we can become

436
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:35,053
clearly cognizant of it."

437
01:07:45,068 --> 01:07:56,850
Here he says that the power of the medicines to change the health

438
01:07:59,665 --> 01:08:07,011
cannot be recognized by mere reason.

439
01:08:10,617 --> 01:08:28,614
That means we cannot say that if you take a medicine which has a bitter taste

440
01:08:31,246 --> 01:08:46,833
will help your liver. Because the liver needs more bitter things.

441
01:08:52,323 --> 01:09:01,099
He says that in order to say later on that we have to try the different remedies

442
01:09:02,115 --> 01:09:08,570
upon the human organisms in order to see what changes can produce.

443
01:09:24,102 --> 01:09:33,597
The idea is that he wants us to understand that the tool we are going to use

444
01:09:34,781 --> 01:09:41,167
it has to be tested first in the human organism.

445
01:09:42,567 --> 01:09:49,240
Not imagining, not reasoning, not anything of that type with the mind

446
01:09:50,772 --> 01:09:54,337
with the imagination. Are facts.

447
01:10:01,785 --> 01:10:04,903
"Now, as it is undeniable that the curative principle in medicines is not

448
01:10:06,074 --> 01:10:09,436
in itself perceptible..."

449
01:10:12,123 --> 01:10:21,882
The real power of the drug is not the fact that the remedy is green or the remedy

450
01:10:23,946 --> 01:10:30,736
has this or that consistency or anything like that.

451
01:10:32,238 --> 01:10:40,068
He brings a totally new idea that the remedies have a power which is hidden

452
01:10:41,490 --> 01:10:45,443
in the remedy. Nobody can see it.

453
01:10:53,453 --> 01:11:06,331
He has understood that the effect of the remedies are not depending

454
01:11:07,511 --> 01:11:09,425
on their chemical substance.

455
01:11:10,964 --> 01:11:20,652
Depend on their inner power to change the health of the humans.

456
01:11:33,702 --> 01:11:40,101
"[...]and as in pure experiments with medicines conducted by the most accurate

457
01:11:41,344 --> 01:11:48,276
observers, nothing can be observed that can constitute them medicines or remedies

458
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:56,119
except that power of causing distinct alterations in the state of health

459
01:11:57,087 --> 01:12:05,293
of the human body and particularly in that of the healthy individual..."

460
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:22,621
Only a pure experiment upon the healthy can reveal the power of the remedies.

461
01:12:25,418 --> 01:12:36,018
"[...]and of exciting in him various definite morbid symptoms; so it follows that

462
01:12:36,571 --> 01:12:43,091
when medicines act as remedies, they can only bring their curative property

463
01:12:43,908 --> 01:12:51,028
into play by means of this, their power of altering man's state of health

464
01:12:51,998 --> 01:12:55,651
by the production of peculiar symptoms..."

465
01:12:57,641 --> 01:13:03,756
So the remedies can cure because they have the power to produce peculiar

466
01:13:05,410 --> 01:13:13,451
symptoms to themselves. "[...]and therefore, we have only to rely on the morbid

467
01:13:14,437 --> 01:13:21,144
phenomena which the medicines produce in the healthy body, as the sole possible

468
01:13:22,459 --> 01:13:25,554
revelation of their in-dwelling curative power."

469
01:13:26,422 --> 01:13:33,005
So we have to rely exclusively on the possibility of the remedies that have

470
01:13:34,106 --> 01:13:46,960
to produce morbid symptoms, which are beyond health.

471
01:13:49,729 --> 01:13:54,736
"[...]and at the same time what disease-curing power, each individual medicine

472
01:13:55,707 --> 01:13:57,415
possesses."

473
01:14:02,058 --> 01:14:13,953
He brings the idea here to two things; first that the remedies have an inner power

474
01:14:14,769 --> 01:14:23,743
to change the state of health and the second is that the symptoms they can alter

475
01:14:24,410 --> 01:14:31,173
and produce in the human organism are the ones that will guide you to the selection

476
01:14:31,980 --> 01:14:34,034
of the remedy.

477
01:14:35,722 --> 01:14:41,976
"But as nothing is to be observed in diseases that must be removed in order

478
01:14:42,544 --> 01:14:48,147
to change them into health besides the totality of their signs and symptoms,

479
01:14:48,845 --> 01:14:55,625
and likewise medicines can show nothing curative besides their tendency to produce

480
01:14:56,292 --> 01:15:01,835
morbid symptoms in healthy persons and to remove them in diseased persons".

481
01:15:04,174 --> 01:15:13,229
He says, in the same way that in a disease we can only see the totality of symptoms,

482
01:15:14,859 --> 01:15:21,684
in medicines also we have to use the totality of the symptoms the remedy can

483
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:32,494
produce in order to alleviate these symptoms. Here is the law of similars.

484
01:15:39,229 --> 01:15:46,433
The phrases are too long and sometimes you have to epitomize.

485
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:51,888
"[...]it follows, on the one hand, that medicines only become remedies and capable

486
01:15:52,408 --> 01:16:03,036
of annihilating disease because the medicinal substance, by exciting certain effects

487
01:16:04,056 --> 01:16:09,806
and symptoms, that is to say, by producing a certain artificial morbid state, removes

488
01:16:10,452 --> 01:16:16,755
and abrogates the symptoms already present, to wit, the natural morbid state

489
01:16:17,757 --> 01:16:20,316
we wish to cure."

490
01:16:23,699 --> 01:16:30,975
What he says is that the remedy which has similar symptoms with the disease

491
01:16:31,953 --> 01:16:35,660
will take away the symptoms of the disease.

492
01:16:38,555 --> 01:16:46,093
The similarity of the symptoms produced by the remedy will take away the totality

493
01:16:47,228 --> 01:16:49,404
of the symptoms.

494
01:16:51,592 --> 01:16:57,139
"[...] On the other hand, it follows that, for the totality of the symptoms of the disease

495
01:16:57,822 --> 01:17:07,753
to be cured, that medicine must be sought which have the greatest tendency

496
01:17:08,929 --> 01:17:15,497
to produce similar or opposite symptoms."

497
01:17:22,534 --> 01:17:30,639
He says that we must try to find the remedy which has produced similar symptoms

498
01:17:32,305 --> 01:17:45,286
in order to prescribe it to the patient. "(according as experience shall prove whether

499
01:17:46,201 --> 01:17:50,582
the morbid symptoms are most readily, certainly, and permanently removed and

500
01:17:51,524 --> 01:17:58,232
changed into health by similar or opposite medicinal symptoms)"

501
01:18:01,322 --> 01:18:09,716
"The other possible mode of employing medicines for diseases besides these two

502
01:18:10,823 --> 01:18:44,368
is the allopathic method in which medicines are given, whose symptoms have

503
01:18:45,252 --> 01:18:55,822
no direct pathological relation to the morbid state, neither similar nor opposite,

504
01:18:57,002 --> 01:19:01,691
but quite heterogeneous to the symptoms of the disease".

505
01:19:09,878 --> 01:19:16,115
In order to make us understand what he wants to say, he says

506
01:19:18,319 --> 01:19:23,683
if you give a remedy that has produced similar symptoms this will alleviate

507
01:19:25,702 --> 01:19:28,232
the totality of the symptoms of the case.

508
01:19:29,983 --> 01:19:34,714
There is another way that you can prescribe an opposite.

509
01:19:40,739 --> 01:19:50,509
That means you want to stop diarrhea. You will give a remedy that produces

510
01:19:51,936 --> 01:19:55,153
constipation. These are the 2 ways.

511
01:19:56,318 --> 01:20:02,942
Besides that there are other allopathic methods where they give any remedy

512
01:20:04,519 --> 01:20:05,826
for any reason.

513
01:20:07,201 --> 01:20:22,523
But the 2 most acceptable ways of prescribing remedies is the similar and the opposite.

514
01:20:29,396 --> 01:20:36,719
He accepts that by giving an opposite, a remedy that produces the opposite symptoms

515
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:42,824
than the one the patient has, is a way of prescribing remedies.

516
01:20:52,758 --> 01:20:57,459
He realizes it like Hippocrates also.

517
01:20:59,505 --> 01:21:08,018
He says that remedies could be prescribed by having opposite effect on the problem

518
01:21:09,174 --> 01:21:17,124
of the patient. If the patient has diarrhea, you give a remedy that can produce

519
01:21:18,072 --> 01:21:23,754
constipation. And you give it in big doses and you cure it.

520
01:21:25,863 --> 01:21:32,983
This was a way existing since the time of Hippocrates.

521
01:21:34,603 --> 01:21:40,763
It was Hippocrates who brought this idea of the opposites first

522
01:21:42,645 --> 01:21:46,422
and Hahnemann knew all that and he refers to this.

523
01:21:47,692 --> 01:21:56,055
He said this is logical. But it is not logical if you give a remedy which has nothing

524
01:21:58,752 --> 01:22:00,458
to do with the symptomatology of the person.

525
01:22:03,111 --> 01:22:08,177
That means you give a remedy that has no opposite or similar effects then...

526
01:22:10,404 --> 01:22:12,843
this cannot have an effect at all.

527
01:22:23,508 --> 01:22:27,767
"All pure experience, however, and all accurate research convince us that

528
01:22:28,611 --> 01:22:34,925
persistent symptoms of disease are far from being removed and annihilated

529
01:22:35,540 --> 01:22:37,777
by opposite symptoms of medicines."

530
01:22:39,553 --> 01:22:49,307
He explains and says there is that but he says that "all accurate research convince us

531
01:22:50,274 --> 01:22:56,741
that persistent symptoms of disease are far from being removed" by the opposites.

532
01:22:59,771 --> 01:23:08,133
He says you can give an opposite, you can give a laxative to a case

533
01:23:09,857 --> 01:23:16,767
where there is constipation. You give a drug which produces diarrhea.

534
01:23:20,698 --> 01:23:30,316
But this fact is far from being removed and annihilated, but these symptoms are really

535
01:23:31,146 --> 01:23:40,261
not removed and annihilated by opposite symptoms of medicines.

536
01:23:44,497 --> 01:23:54,948
"[...]that, on the contrary, after transient, apparent alleviation, they break forth again"

537
01:23:56,758 --> 01:24:02,344
You take the remedy for constipation, you have this diarrhea but on the contrary

538
01:24:02,981 --> 01:24:05,261
next time you may have stronger diarrhea.

539
01:24:14,196 --> 01:24:17,645
"[...] only with increased intensity and become manifestly aggravated".

540
01:24:20,036 --> 01:24:29,350
He relates his experience because they used to give several drugs on material doses

541
01:24:31,056 --> 01:24:39,200
to have an effect and he has noticed that later on after the patient has used frequently

542
01:24:41,675 --> 01:24:49,488
heavy doses of remedies on the idea of the opposites,

543
01:24:50,936 --> 01:25:00,915
eventually they had an aggravation. And he concludes, therefore

544
01:25:04,147 --> 01:25:12,356
"There is only one way of employing medicines in diseases that promises to be of

545
01:25:13,168 --> 01:25:19,028
service besides the homoeopathic, there is no other, by means of which we seek,

546
01:25:19,922 --> 01:25:24,057
for the totality of the symptoms of the case of disease, a medicine which among

547
01:25:24,703 --> 01:25:34,131
all medicines has the power and the tendency to produce an artificial morbid state

548
01:25:35,435 --> 01:25:40,363
most similar to that of the case of disease in question."

549
01:25:41,773 --> 01:25:50,205
Therefore you seek to find the most close remedy that has produced

550
01:25:50,776 --> 01:25:52,314
similar symptoms.

551
01:26:04,489 --> 01:26:11,001
All this concept is targeting towards the idea of one remedy.

552
01:26:13,684 --> 01:26:18,821
You have to find a remedy which has a similar totality of symptoms.

553
01:26:20,124 --> 01:26:36,452
That is why we cannot accept to practice Homeopathy with mixtures of remedies.

554
01:26:43,357 --> 01:26:46,776
This is what I realized when I read the Organon.

555
01:26:48,042 --> 01:26:53,087
I have taken these mixtures of remedies, they had some effect but at the same time

556
01:26:54,280 --> 01:27:04,641
they had side effect. Therefore then when I read this, I understood how wrong it was

557
01:27:06,392 --> 01:27:12,797
to practice Medicine with mixopathy, mixtures of remedies.

558
01:27:17,102 --> 01:27:23,097
And then when I tried to find out what was going on in the world at this time

559
01:27:24,301 --> 01:27:35,393
I found out that actually the 95% of the Homeopaths of the time in the 60s

560
01:27:36,419 --> 01:27:43,901
prescribed mixtures of remedies, because they did not want to sit down with

561
01:27:44,773 --> 01:27:50,078
the patient and discover his totality of the symptoms.

562
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:57,913
And then they had not studied enough the M.M. to realize that this concept

563
01:27:58,449 --> 01:28:01,436
fits with this concept.

564
01:28:25,314 --> 01:28:32,670
Paragraph 25, "Now, however, in all careful trials, pure experience,

565
01:28:33,558 --> 01:28:42,549
the sole and infallible oracle of the healing art, teaches us that actually

566
01:28:43,046 --> 01:28:49,473
that medicine which, in its action on the healthy human body, has demonstrated

567
01:28:50,217 --> 01:28:58,601
its power of producing the greatest number of symptoms similar to those observable

568
01:28:59,343 --> 01:29:08,864
in the patient, does also, in doses of suitable potency and attenuation, rapidly,

569
01:29:09,821 --> 01:29:17,218
radically and permanently remove the totality of the symptoms of this morbid state."

570
01:29:23,096 --> 01:29:43,357
Observation is the only way to perceive the real truth of what is happening.

571
01:29:47,624 --> 01:29:52,559
"[...] the sole and infallible oracle of the healing art"

572
01:29:57,634 --> 01:30:05,853
Observation and pure experience teaches that this is the only way

573
01:30:06,799 --> 01:30:09,232
that you can cure cases.
