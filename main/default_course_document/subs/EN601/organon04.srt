1
00:00:19,803 --> 00:00:29,949
We have seen the line of thinking of Hahnemann, who tries to persuade everybody

2
00:00:33,755 --> 00:00:38,722
that here we have found something of very great value that nobody can doubt

3
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:50,466
that it is so. That a disease is cured by a remedy that has similar symptoms

4
00:00:51,487 --> 00:00:54,670
in its proving with a disease.

5
00:00:58,521 --> 00:01:08,193
From this paragraph on we have a problem.

6
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:23,987
We disagree with Hahnemann. I disagree with what he writes and I will explain

7
00:01:25,144 --> 00:01:33,133
that to you. This process of the similar remedy curing the similar disease

8
00:01:35,918 --> 00:01:41,804
"depends on the following homeopathic law of nature which was sometimes

9
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:51,113
indeed, vaguely surmised but not hitherto fully recognized."

10
00:01:52,749 --> 00:02:00,146
It was mentioned by others. But not fully recognized.

11
00:02:01,068 --> 00:02:08,380
"[...] and to which is due every real cure that has ever taken place"

12
00:02:10,684 --> 00:02:14,281
And now he states the law

13
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:25,294
"[...] A weaker dynamic affection is permanently extinguished in the living organism

14
00:02:26,685 --> 00:02:47,791
by a stronger one, if the latter is very similar to the former in its manifestations".

15
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:15,176
His idea is that an affection in the human body, the disease, is extinguished

16
00:03:17,772 --> 00:03:30,135
by a dynamic intervention through the remedy if the latter (if this dynamic affection

17
00:03:32,203 --> 00:03:37,742
by the remedy) is very similar to the former in its manifestation."

18
00:03:45,298 --> 00:03:52,738
He has a logic and he wants to support this logic.

19
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:59,212
I will commend later on after I have shown you paragraph after paragraph.

20
00:04:01,765 --> 00:04:09,075
"The curative power of medicines depends on their symptoms, similar to the disease

21
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:14,138
but superior to it in strength".

22
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:30,546
The curative power of the remedies is due to the fact that this dynamic form

23
00:04:32,295 --> 00:04:43,491
of remedies is superior in strength than the disease.

24
00:04:49,046 --> 00:04:54,670
"[...]so that each individual case of disease is most surely, radically, rapidly and

25
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:00,330
permanently annihilated and removed only by a medicine capable of producing

26
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,002
(in the human system) in the most similar and complete manner the totality of

27
00:05:05,668 --> 00:05:10,299
its symptoms, which at the same time are stronger than the disease."

28
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:22,145
He insists that the fact that the remedy cures the disease is because the power

29
00:05:22,962 --> 00:05:28,869
of the remedy is stronger than the power of the disease.

30
00:05:33,003 --> 00:05:34,603
I will read some more.

31
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,401
"As this natural law of cure manifests itself in every pure experiment and every true

32
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:51,259
observation in the world, the fact is consequently established; it matters little what

33
00:05:53,365 --> 00:06:00,512
may be the scientific explanation of how it takes place..."

34
00:06:02,748 --> 00:06:08,600
For the first time Hahnemann has a doubt of what he states.

35
00:06:10,756 --> 00:06:17,377
Until this time Hahnemann has said there is no experience in the world who can say

36
00:06:18,184 --> 00:06:24,226
this is not so. This is first and the only time where he mentions

37
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:39,963
"[...] it matters little what may be the scientific explanation of how it takes place..."

38
00:06:43,796 --> 00:06:47,588
It's not important for me but I will tell you my idea.

39
00:06:48,996 --> 00:06:56,872
"[...] and I do not attach much importance to the attempts made to explain it.

40
00:07:04,182 --> 00:07:14,274
But the following view seems to commend itself as the most probable explanation,

41
00:07:16,396 --> 00:07:22,291
as it is founded on premises derived from experience".

42
00:07:28,231 --> 00:07:33,322
"As every disease consists only in a special, morbid, dynamic alteration of our

43
00:07:33,901 --> 00:07:38,621
vital energy manifested in sensation and motion, so in every homeopathic cure

44
00:07:39,497 --> 00:07:45,137
this principle of life dynamically altered by natural disease is seized through the

45
00:07:45,606 --> 00:07:48,950
administration of medicinal potency..." etc.

46
00:07:55,999 --> 00:07:58,099
Do you understand what he says?

47
00:08:01,727 --> 00:08:08,734
The remedy is more powerful than the disease therefore what it does, he will explain

48
00:08:09,516 --> 00:08:19,670
later on, it takes hold of the disease, suppresses the disease and whatever left over

49
00:08:20,807 --> 00:08:30,904
is out of this powerful intervention with the remedy, then with time also goes away.

50
00:08:33,844 --> 00:08:42,767
That means he understands that there are some symptoms that they may be left over,

51
00:08:43,585 --> 00:08:51,696
belonging to the remedy after the cure but these remaining symptoms will just go away

52
00:08:52,927 --> 00:09:04,558
with time. This is his explanation and he maintains that the cure takes place

53
00:09:05,716 --> 00:09:13,418
because the remedy is more powerful than the disease.

54
00:09:14,528 --> 00:09:21,849
When there's a weaker dynamic affection it's overwhelmed by a stronger one

55
00:09:23,382 --> 00:09:26,176
and this goes away.

56
00:09:28,695 --> 00:09:34,879
I was reading this by that time I remember and also I remember I was trying

57
00:09:35,907 --> 00:09:42,084
when people asked me how this happens. And I could not persuade them

58
00:09:43,109 --> 00:09:45,644
with this explanation.

59
00:09:48,349 --> 00:09:52,588
So I said to myself, something else is happening.

60
00:09:53,681 --> 00:10:00,696
Also I did not understand myself. How is that possible that this is not a suppression?

61
00:10:02,781 --> 00:10:06,484
If this is stronger it suppresses.

62
00:10:08,934 --> 00:10:16,485
Eventually I came to the realization of what really happens.

63
00:10:18,398 --> 00:10:27,579
I will give you my explanation so you can judge which of the 2 explanations

64
00:10:29,202 --> 00:10:31,270
is the most probable.

65
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:52,188
The symptomatology develops after the defense mechanism has been triggered

66
00:10:54,517 --> 00:11:04,707
by a morbific influence. Something attacks the organism whether physical or psychic,

67
00:11:06,821 --> 00:11:10,827
the organisms reacts with the totality of symptoms.

68
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:19,136
Why does the organism do this reaction?

69
00:11:22,385 --> 00:11:25,748
Hahnemann gave his logic and I will give you my logic.

70
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:40,732
What do the symptoms represent? We say it's a reaction of the vital force.

71
00:11:42,782 --> 00:11:52,945
A reaction for what? The reason there is a reaction and the specific symptoms

72
00:11:54,185 --> 00:12:03,183
that the organism develops is in order to cure itself.

73
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:16,696
That's way the organism brings out symptoms. It's in order to reestablish the balance.

74
00:12:18,098 --> 00:12:20,711
An example.

75
00:12:23,293 --> 00:12:28,291
Your organism is attacked by bacteria or a microbe.

76
00:12:29,438 --> 00:12:38,544
The first thing we see is the raising of the temperature of the body, fever, high fever.

77
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:56,549
And after 3 days whether he takes medicine or not the whole thing subsides.

78
00:12:58,635 --> 00:13:06,934
The organism comes back to normal. He was attacked, reacted and because he reacted,

79
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:15,995
why has he developed the fever? Because the organism realizes that these microbes

80
00:13:17,448 --> 00:13:31,057
that entered my body are so violent, virulent that I have to do something.

81
00:13:32,454 --> 00:13:36,229
Otherwise I will die. What can I do?

82
00:13:39,522 --> 00:13:47,377
I can raise the temperature so I know that these microbes can only live in an

83
00:13:48,223 --> 00:13:52,795
environment which is less than 40.2 C.

84
00:13:56,048 --> 00:14:02,498
If I raise my temperature in 40.3 C they die.

85
00:14:05,272 --> 00:14:15,855
This is the idea of the process of an acute disease which has a prodromal period,

86
00:14:20,311 --> 00:14:31,772
(the multiplication of the microbes) then it comes the main period, where we have

87
00:14:32,536 --> 00:14:37,141
the reaction of the organism, once the organism realizes then the bacteria are

88
00:14:37,946 --> 00:14:41,805
overwhelming me starts the reaction.

89
00:14:43,144 --> 00:14:53,153
The reaction raises the temperature and eventually comes the resolution of the acute

90
00:14:53,353 --> 00:15:05,538
which is either cure or death.

91
00:15:07,247 --> 00:15:18,337
If the microbes need a temperature of 40.3 C and the organism can raise up to 40 C

92
00:15:20,818 --> 00:15:37,379
the microbes keep on multiplying and then the organism tries more and more and

93
00:15:38,213 --> 00:15:40,767
finally gets very tired and succumbs and dies.

94
00:15:43,395 --> 00:15:54,795
The ending of every acute condition is either a cure by the reaction of the organism

95
00:15:56,883 --> 00:16:05,767
or death if the organism is not able to bring up a strong enough reaction.

96
00:16:10,473 --> 00:16:17,217
They understood this. This is the reason why we have symptoms.

97
00:16:23,071 --> 00:16:34,366
But if that is true that symptoms are useful for the organism which is manifesting them,

98
00:16:36,137 --> 00:16:39,691
if they are useful, then they should not be suppressed.

99
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:50,023
Because if you suppress them, then you will have side effects.

100
00:16:53,768 --> 00:17:03,010
Somewhere else the organism will find a way to diffuse the problem.

101
00:17:14,207 --> 00:17:25,138
With antibiotics we know what happens. We have found ways to suffocate

102
00:17:27,158 --> 00:17:34,705
the microbes through antibiotics and in this way we attack the microbes.

103
00:17:43,348 --> 00:17:50,203
How we treat successfully in acute conditions with Homeopathy?

104
00:17:50,893 --> 00:17:54,744
By the similar remedy. What is the similar remedy?

105
00:17:56,021 --> 00:18:03,600
You must remember we have given a remedy that produced in healthy organisms

106
00:18:04,505 --> 00:18:06,944
a totality of symptoms.

107
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:12,570
We take this remedy which produces similar symptoms with the organism

108
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:23,335
under observation and we take this remedy and give it to this organism.

109
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:33,349
But if this remedy had produced similar symptoms with those of the organism

110
00:18:34,818 --> 00:18:46,371
and you give this remedy, this remedy instead of going over and suppress

111
00:18:48,165 --> 00:18:51,905
the manifestation, what will do?

112
00:18:53,752 --> 00:18:59,358
The mechanics is that the organism in order to save himself it produces

113
00:19:00,642 --> 00:19:04,807
symptomatology. Then you take a remedy that produces similar symptomatology

114
00:19:05,883 --> 00:19:13,121
and you give it to the organism. For God's sake, what's going to happen?

115
00:19:15,198 --> 00:19:29,828
You will kill the organism because the remedy you give, will make symptoms worse.

116
00:19:33,292 --> 00:19:39,570
Because it is the same mechanism.

117
00:19:40,767 --> 00:19:46,439
When the organism receives that particular substance reacts in a similar way like

118
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:58,007
it's reacting during disease. So you give on top of the reaction that has produced

119
00:19:58,935 --> 00:20:06,372
the organism, you give a remedy to increase the reaction of the organism.

120
00:20:07,863 --> 00:20:16,730
To increase the symptoms, not to decrease them. Is it clear?

121
00:20:20,032 --> 00:20:27,206
Therefore the idea of Hahnemann most probably was wrong.

122
00:20:31,126 --> 00:20:44,612
He understood that... it's not important what it happens but I will tell you.

123
00:20:45,365 --> 00:20:54,702
The remedy is stronger and suppresses the weaker dynamic disturbance.

124
00:20:57,214 --> 00:21:04,682
In reality it increases the reaction of the organism. By that time what it does?

125
00:21:06,003 --> 00:21:16,358
As I said before, the organism needs in a pneumonia to reach for streptococcal

126
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:26,107
infection in order for the microbes to die 40.2 C.

127
00:21:31,096 --> 00:21:43,684
It cannot reach that and makes an effort, 40, 40.1, in the morning the organism is tired

128
00:21:44,777 --> 00:21:57,576
38 C, in the evening it comes again 40.1 C to burn out the microbes.

129
00:21:58,858 --> 00:22:04,324
And the third day in the pneumonia the organism is struggling and is starting

130
00:22:04,946 --> 00:22:07,731
to collapse. It's going to die.

131
00:22:14,931 --> 00:22:19,901
There you come with your knowledge and you give this little push to the defense

132
00:22:20,938 --> 00:22:33,430
mechanism, the vital force and you stimulate it. 40.2 C and the next day... no fever.

133
00:22:37,353 --> 00:22:43,314
You see the logic behind?

134
00:22:44,812 --> 00:22:50,569
- I think on one hand, you're right. For instance the phenomenon, if you give in

135
00:22:51,566 --> 00:22:59,578
childhood fever 39.5 C a Belladonna, it can be that the fever rises even more but

136
00:23:00,066 --> 00:23:04,588
then it goes down and I always explain to the parents that fever has its own sense,

137
00:23:05,812 --> 00:23:11,526
in times it works better, the homeopathic remedy doesn't suppress immediately but

138
00:23:12,755 --> 00:23:21,491
it helps to go over the peak of the mountain and then it can go into the healing.

139
00:23:23,488 --> 00:23:36,024
So the period when the fever raises as a first reaction is in your sense the reaction of

140
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:42,628
the organism will be stimulated even more but then it starts what Hahnemann says

141
00:23:43,858 --> 00:23:51,211
the wiping out and the fever goes down by itself.

142
00:23:52,357 --> 00:23:56,831
And the organism knows itself when this is the time.

143
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:01,773
So you are right and Hahnemann is also right.

144
00:24:18,314 --> 00:24:26,481
-There is a proverb in Greece. We say, you cannot have a full pie and at the same

145
00:24:27,478 --> 00:24:37,440
the dog is fed quite well. This is not possible.

146
00:24:38,835 --> 00:24:42,440
What you say is not correct, it contradicts itself.

147
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:57,599
Hahnemann says that the dynamic reaction - and he will further support this idea-

148
00:25:00,071 --> 00:25:16,383
is stronger... He will say actually later on that the remedies can affect all organisms.

149
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:30,075
That means if I increase the amount of the substance,

150
00:25:39,847 --> 00:25:42,496
there us going to be an effect in everyone.

151
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:55,154
If I give you - not poison, a simple substance, the mother tincture of Gelsemium-

152
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:16,248
100 mg, 3 times a day. The second or the third day there will be some of you

153
00:26:17,087 --> 00:26:20,602
who will say I have some dizziness.

154
00:26:23,892 --> 00:26:37,338
If I increase this, 500 mg and then I continue to 1 gr of mother tincture, 2, 3, 5, 10,

155
00:26:38,786 --> 00:26:45,327
20 gr, everyone will have eventually symptoms.

156
00:26:46,619 --> 00:26:57,530
So Hahnemann will say later the medicine can be increasing in amount and can

157
00:26:58,478 --> 00:27:03,009
affect everybody while the disease cannot affect everybody.

158
00:27:04,487 --> 00:27:11,897
It may be an epidemic and out of us only 20% will be affected.

159
00:27:14,865 --> 00:27:21,718
The epidemic does not affect all people. You must have a predisposition.

160
00:27:23,434 --> 00:27:28,767
But with medication you don't have to have a predisposition.

161
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:42,840
If I give you enough substance will create what today is understood as side effects

162
00:27:43,887 --> 00:27:46,055
of chemical drugs.

163
00:27:47,594 --> 00:27:57,236
If I give you one week of antibiotics, some of you will be destroyed within a week.

164
00:27:58,354 --> 00:28:04,525
Some will not feel very much. But if I continue and increase the dose and instead

165
00:28:05,357 --> 00:28:18,504
of 500 mg, I give you 1 gr 3 times a day, in 10 days everybody will be in bed.

166
00:28:20,506 --> 00:28:29,626
His idea is the medicine, the substance can affect, therefore it's stronger than

167
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:35,757
the disease who can affect only certain individuals.

168
00:28:37,657 --> 00:28:48,531
This is where he went wrong and thought the explanation.

169
00:28:50,083 --> 00:28:56,633
But as I said, he himself doubts what he writes.

170
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:01,728
"[...]I do not attach much importance...".

171
00:29:39,988 --> 00:29:48,275
"As every disease (not entirely surgical)..." why he says "not entirely surgical"?

172
00:29:54,028 --> 00:30:00,734
He has also seen that when a tumor has been formed, most probably by that time

173
00:30:02,554 --> 00:30:12,940
he would see some malignant tumors and he would see that the organism

174
00:30:14,372 --> 00:30:21,610
had reached a stage beyond which the remedy could not affect

175
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:28,056
and he calls it non-surgical. That means if there is a big tumor,

176
00:30:30,536 --> 00:30:35,929
I don't know when the surgery has started coming, but it appears in his time

177
00:30:37,889 --> 00:30:45,860
they had started some good surgery, he says if it is not a surgical disease,

178
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,276
then we could do something.

179
00:30:55,485 --> 00:31:02,335
"[...]consists only in a special, morbid, dynamic alteration of vital energy...

180
00:31:10,886 --> 00:31:21,817
manifested in sensation and motion, so in every homeopathic cure

181
00:31:23,331 --> 00:31:30,433
this principle of life dynamically altered by natural disease is seized through

182
00:31:31,362 --> 00:31:38,239
the administration of medicinal potency selected exactly according to symptom

183
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:48,885
similarity by a somewhat stronger, similar artificial disease manifestation".

184
00:31:51,648 --> 00:32:02,987
The idea of a stronger medicinal affection still continues.

185
00:32:04,477 --> 00:32:11,776
"[...] By this the feeling of the natural (weaker) dynamic disease manifestation

186
00:32:13,018 --> 00:32:14,479
ceases and disappears.

187
00:32:17,555 --> 00:32:24,603
This disease manifestation no longer exists for the principle of life which is now

188
00:32:25,469 --> 00:32:32,099
occupied and governed merely by the stronger, artificial disease manifestation".

189
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:41,456
His idea is that the disease is weaker, the medicinal power is stronger

190
00:32:42,995 --> 00:32:54,948
and the medicinal power takes over and defeats the weaker manifestation and

191
00:32:55,830 --> 00:33:00,248
now the stronger is ruling the organism.

192
00:33:06,823 --> 00:33:14,573
"[...] This artificial disease manifestation has soon spent its force and leaves

193
00:33:15,415 --> 00:33:17,795
the patient free from disease and cured".

194
00:33:20,718 --> 00:33:37,313
This stronger artificial disease takes hold and leaves the organism free.

195
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:53,068
"[...] The dynamis, thus freed, can now continue to carry life on in health.

196
00:33:54,777 --> 00:34:03,425
This most highly probable process..." You see Hahnemann who never doubts, says

197
00:34:04,136 --> 00:34:14,500
"This most highly probable process rests upon the following propositions."

198
00:34:16,753 --> 00:34:21,396
So I will explain to you this it's probable.

199
00:34:24,401 --> 00:34:31,032
"The human body appears to admit of being much more powerfully affected

200
00:34:32,397 --> 00:34:41,817
in its health by medicines than by natural morbid stimuli - for natural diseases

201
00:34:42,822 --> 00:34:45,216
are cured and overcome by suitable medicines".

202
00:34:47,696 --> 00:34:54,958
What I said before. For him natural diseases are weaker because they are cured

203
00:34:56,275 --> 00:34:59,361
by medicines, so medicines are stronger than diseases.

204
00:35:05,675 --> 00:35:11,391
He has not perceived the mechanism underlying his discovery.

205
00:35:12,394 --> 00:35:14,141
The real mechanism is different.

206
00:35:19,179 --> 00:35:26,696
"The human body appears to admit of being much more powerfully affected in

207
00:35:27,569 --> 00:35:41,062
its health by medicines than by natural diseases - for natural diseases are cured and overcome by suitable medicines".

208
00:35:45,318 --> 00:35:55,087
Paragraph 31, "The inimical forces, partly psychical, partly physical,

209
00:35:57,805 --> 00:36:11,234
to which our terrestrial existence is exposed, which are termed morbific noxious

210
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:18,915
agents, do not possess the power of morbidly deranging the health of man

211
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,470
unconditionally". This is what we said.

212
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:39,803
The stresses whatever psychical or physical do not have the power to affect all

213
00:36:40,925 --> 00:36:43,786
the organisms unconditionally.

214
00:36:50,846 --> 00:36:58,670
"[...] but we are made ill by them only when our organism is sufficiently disposed

215
00:36:59,782 --> 00:37:02,426
and susceptible to the attack..."

216
00:37:04,434 --> 00:37:09,539
Hahnemann had realized everything was happening.

217
00:37:10,111 --> 00:37:15,366
The fact that we disagree for this little explanation, it means nothing to take away

218
00:37:15,955 --> 00:37:25,028
from his genius. He says in order for somebody to get sick, he must be predisposed

219
00:37:25,958 --> 00:37:34,743
to it, he must have a susceptibility, a predisposition, otherwise he will not be affected.

220
00:37:36,282 --> 00:37:51,554
You see how this predisposition is manifested in an organism.

221
00:37:55,077 --> 00:38:03,290
I'll give you a very practical example which everybody will understand.

222
00:38:09,572 --> 00:38:17,903
At the age of 16 you had a lover and he behaved very badly and he said something

223
00:38:18,907 --> 00:38:21,185
insulting to you.

224
00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:29,072
At the age of 18 you had another lover and he behaved in a similar way.

225
00:38:32,736 --> 00:38:44,270
The 3rd lover that you will have, you will expect that he will be behaving in a similar

226
00:38:45,541 --> 00:38:56,495
way and you already have created in you a susceptibility for this particular stress.

227
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:05,680
"If he tells me I don't like you anymore and I must leave you because I am

228
00:39:08,218 --> 00:39:19,048
out of love with you" that can be so stressful because this susceptibility has been

229
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:25,187
building up in you and the 3rd time you hear this stress...

230
00:39:26,365 --> 00:39:32,444
the first time you overcome, the 2nd time it was a bit more difficult, the 3rd

231
00:39:33,227 --> 00:39:48,013
but the 4th time you're destroyed because the psychical impact found ground

232
00:39:50,649 --> 00:40:01,231
that was preparing to be affected very much by such a stress.

233
00:40:03,408 --> 00:40:15,703
The same organism, the same human being has a shock because lost his job.

234
00:40:19,816 --> 00:40:29,193
He lost it first, second, third time... He doesn't care. He tries for another job.

235
00:40:30,564 --> 00:40:40,550
There is a stress again but this organism is susceptible to that particular information.

236
00:40:41,577 --> 00:40:52,979
That particular information is going to create a problem as disease in the body.

237
00:40:54,975 --> 00:41:08,160
Hahnemann says exactly this "[...]but we are made ill by them only when our organism

238
00:41:14,372 --> 00:41:18,818
is sufficiently disposed and susceptible to attack of the morbific cause that may be present,

239
00:41:19,821 --> 00:41:30,314
and to be altered in its health, deranged and made us to undergo abnormal

240
00:41:31,636 --> 00:41:37,918
sensations and functions - hence they do not produce disease in every one

241
00:41:38,937 --> 00:41:41,032
nor at all times".

242
00:41:42,861 --> 00:41:51,448
So stresses, disease have to find a susceptible ground. He makes that clear.

243
00:42:05,391 --> 00:42:11,455
- I just wanted to understand the nature of stress. Can the stress be turned into a

244
00:42:12,416 --> 00:42:17,645
disposition if it happens over and over or some people will not be affected even

245
00:42:18,476 --> 00:42:19,909
if it happens over and over?

246
00:42:23,926 --> 00:42:31,027
- A stress if it happens over and over again, it will definitely create a predisposition

247
00:42:33,834 --> 00:42:47,488
but in the same individual different kind of stresses will take different number

248
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:54,159
of times that the organism should be attacked.

249
00:42:58,707 --> 00:43:08,269
A woman likes her children. But there are women who can leave the daughters,

250
00:43:09,497 --> 00:43:15,154
the son. They run away with a lover and they leave the child.

251
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:26,829
That woman does not have a susceptibility on this area.

252
00:43:27,929 --> 00:43:35,579
Another woman for all her life it's her daughter. You can imagine with the first attack

253
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:42,751
on the daughter, that means the daughter becomes sick. It's a big thing!

254
00:43:42,951 --> 00:43:50,299
The daughter becomes so sick that she may die. The woman will be destroyed.

255
00:43:50,499 --> 00:43:57,260
That area for that woman is a sensitive one.

256
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:09,213
The next time if the daughter continues to become sick more and more, the stress on

257
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:19,225
the mother will be so great that she will becomes ill, she will definitely develop some

258
00:44:20,165 --> 00:44:28,014
kind of chronic condition. But there must be a susceptibility.

259
00:44:30,218 --> 00:44:32,878
And then he will continue...

260
00:44:34,114 --> 00:44:45,383
"But it is quite otherwise with the artificial morbific agents which we term medicines.

261
00:44:45,583 --> 00:44:57,461
Every real medicine, namely, acts at all times, under all circumstances, on every living

262
00:44:57,661 --> 00:45:12,005
human being, and produces in him its peculiar symptoms (distinctly perceptible, if...)"

263
00:45:12,205 --> 00:45:22,605
There is this "if" which many times we do not take into consideration.

264
00:45:22,805 --> 00:45:34,282
The big "if" is this "[...]if the dose be large enough"

265
00:45:38,033 --> 00:45:52,347
All medicines act on all human at all times as long as the dose is large enough.

266
00:45:58,383 --> 00:46:09,456
That means when we want to try a new proving on a remedy,

267
00:46:09,656 --> 00:46:16,036
what do we have to do in order to affect and to produce symptoms?

268
00:46:16,236 --> 00:46:27,122
We have to give large enough doses in the provings.

269
00:46:27,322 --> 00:46:50,265
That means if you want to prove chocolate. You cannot prove chocolate by giving

270
00:46:50,465 --> 00:46:57,089
a little piece of chocolate to everyone.

271
00:46:57,289 --> 00:47:10,740
Today we have to eat 100 gr of chocolate each one, Ok maybe 200 gr.

272
00:47:14,007 --> 00:47:24,173
Out of us there will be 2 or 3 who will come and say I have my stomach this and that...

273
00:47:26,566 --> 00:47:30,582
I will say "out of the experiment". The rest? Nothing happened.

274
00:47:30,782 --> 00:47:42,341
400 gr chocolate today. Another 10 people will have this, headache etc.

275
00:47:42,541 --> 00:47:48,328
You observe, you write down your symptoms. Do you want to continue? Yes.

276
00:47:48,528 --> 00:47:58,492
Half a kilo chocolate. This is the way.

277
00:47:58,692 --> 00:48:05,487
If the dose is large enough, everyone, even those who are very resistant to chocolate

278
00:48:05,687 --> 00:48:10,855
if you keep on giving kilos of chocolate, they will become sick.

279
00:48:18,692 --> 00:48:22,653
How do we prove the remedies?

280
00:48:22,853 --> 00:48:31,766
Those first people who got out of the experiment because with a piece of chocolate

281
00:48:31,966 --> 00:48:36,292
they became sick, they are the most sensitive.

282
00:48:36,492 --> 00:48:43,898
Later on we will find in proving, Hahnemann says, when you have found these people

283
00:48:44,098 --> 00:48:56,450
on these people you can try a high potency. And then you have a real proving.

284
00:48:56,650 --> 00:49:07,161
If the dose is large enough.

285
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:25,082
"[...] so that evidently every living human organism is liable to be affected..."

286
00:49:27,337 --> 00:49:32,423
By a kilo of chocolate every day the 3rd day you may go to the hospital

287
00:49:33,843 --> 00:49:40,625
"[...] and, as it were, inoculated with the medicinal disease at all times

288
00:49:41,975 --> 00:49:51,460
and absolutely (unconditionally), which, as before said, is by no means the case

289
00:49:53,437 --> 00:49:55,449
with the natural diseases".

290
00:49:55,649 --> 00:50:11,350
He says the natural disease does not have the power of increasing the dose.

291
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:19,791
The moment that I am attacked by a group of microbes...

292
00:50:19,991 --> 00:50:28,091
By mistake I ate something with a group of microbes.

293
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:44,795
Then the organism, if it realizes that this is dangerous for my life, will create a reaction

294
00:50:44,995 --> 00:50:57,281
to kill the bacteria. What is the reaction? If you took the bacteria from the alimentary

295
00:50:57,481 --> 00:51:13,410
canal you will start vomiting, diarrhea and purging so that all the possible microbes

296
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:21,138
that they were created within the organism, eventually will be killed through

297
00:51:21,338 --> 00:51:35,728
this reaction. That's why in a food poisoning you always have diarrhea and vomiting.

298
00:51:35,928 --> 00:51:44,937
There are some organisms who are sensitive to this. So a poisoning in one organism

299
00:51:45,137 --> 00:52:02,450
by some microbes ingested will be much milder than another one who very fast will be

300
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:17,366
going into a state of severe acute gastroenteritis with high fever and at the same time

301
00:52:17,566 --> 00:52:24,648
blood in the stool or blood in the vomiting. That is a serious condition.

302
00:52:24,848 --> 00:52:31,214
That means the organism was susceptible to that particular.

303
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:38,479
But the disease does not have the possibility, as I am sick, to increase the dose,

304
00:52:38,679 --> 00:52:42,411
to take some more.

305
00:52:42,611 --> 00:52:48,873
The disease has not the possibility to give me more of the microbes.

306
00:52:49,073 --> 00:52:56,369
I took the microbes, in whatever conditions, because I breathed in or I ingested

307
00:52:56,569 --> 00:53:03,190
but that's finished. After that the reaction starts and the natural disease

308
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:09,235
does not have the possibility to increase the dose, so I can die.

309
00:53:09,435 --> 00:53:15,816
Because you will always die, if diseases had that possibility.

310
00:53:16,016 --> 00:53:20,751
You would never survive.

311
00:53:25,596 --> 00:53:35,254
I will read, just to show you his ideas. "In accordance with this fact..."

312
00:53:35,454 --> 00:53:44,224
that the medicinal powers affect every human "[...]it is undeniably shown by

313
00:53:44,424 --> 00:53:50,298
all experiences that the living human organism is much more disposed and

314
00:53:50,498 --> 00:53:57,239
has a greater liability to be acted on and to have its health arranged by

315
00:53:57,439 --> 00:54:00,349
medicinal powers..."

316
00:54:00,549 --> 00:54:11,490
He has understood this and he says again "it is undeniably shown by all experience"

317
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:20,060
nobody can deny. He did not say this for the way he explained how the remedy works.

318
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:29,525
This is the only time he doubts. Hahnemann knows very well that when he says

319
00:54:29,725 --> 00:54:35,322
there is no doubt, you can bring the whole experience, the whole world,

320
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:37,867
things are like this.

321
00:54:38,067 --> 00:54:46,437
The only time he doubted was when he was explaining the way that the remedy acts.

322
00:54:46,637 --> 00:55:06,237
Paragraph 33, "In accordance with this fact, it is undeniably shown by all experiences

323
00:55:06,437 --> 00:55:14,960
that the living human organism is much more disposed and has a greater liability

324
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:23,305
to be acted on and to have its health deranged by medicinal powers than

325
00:55:23,505 --> 00:55:32,124
by morbific noxious agents and infectious miasms.

326
00:55:32,324 --> 00:55:41,339
Or in other words that the morbific noxious agents posess a power of morbidly

327
00:55:41,539 --> 00:55:53,469
deranging man's health, that is subordinate and conditional, often very conditional

328
00:55:53,669 --> 00:56:00,813
whilst medicinal agents have an absolute unconditional power, greatly superior

329
00:56:01,013 --> 00:56:02,915
to the former."

330
00:56:05,217 --> 00:56:14,651
Hahnemann was just saying as if he was a prophet that the medications that

331
00:56:14,851 --> 00:56:28,111
you are going to give after 200 years are going to suppress and to cause problem

332
00:56:28,311 --> 00:56:40,550
because there is no organism who can resist the effect of chemical substances,

333
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:54,346
medicinal powers. There is no organism who can resist, especially if the dose

334
00:56:54,546 --> 00:57:01,125
is large enough and is repeated, that's exactly what happens today with

335
00:57:01,325 --> 00:57:07,174
conventional, chemical drugs.

336
00:57:07,374 --> 00:57:18,605
The moment they give a drug, what happens is what Hahnemann thought

337
00:57:18,805 --> 00:57:24,913
it was happening with the homeopathic remedy.

338
00:57:28,515 --> 00:57:43,582
It's very interesting that by mistake he predicts the way that a powerful medical

339
00:57:43,782 --> 00:57:56,866
drug can suppress by its power the disease agents.

340
00:57:57,066 --> 00:58:09,756
He thought this was happening on the homeopathic remedies, which was not true.

341
00:58:09,956 --> 00:58:20,775
It is happening when the organism receives large doses of chemical drugs.

342
00:58:32,656 --> 00:58:38,636
In paragraph 34, "The greater strength of the artificial diseases producible

343
00:58:38,836 --> 00:58:47,267
by medicines is however not the sole cause of their power to cure natural diseases.

344
00:58:47,467 --> 00:58:53,338
In order that they may effect a cure, it is before all things requisite that

345
00:58:53,538 --> 00:58:58,150
they should be capable of producing in the human body an artificial disease

346
00:58:58,350 --> 00:59:02,899
as similar as possible to the disease to be cured".

347
00:59:03,099 --> 00:59:10,943
So he says the fact that they're more powerful, it doesn't mean that you

348
00:59:11,143 --> 00:59:14,505
just give any remedy and because it's more powerful than the disease,

349
00:59:14,705 --> 00:59:16,756
it will cure the disease.

350
00:59:16,956 --> 00:59:22,986
You have to give a remedy that has the most similarity with the disease.

351
00:59:38,598 --> 00:59:47,416
"[...] which, with somewhat increased power, transforms to a very similar

352
00:59:47,616 --> 00:59:53,154
morbid state, the instinctive life principle,

353
00:59:53,354 --> 01:00:02,524
which in itself is incapable of any reflection or act of memory.

354
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:10,428
It not only obscures but extinguishes and thereby annihilates the derangement

355
01:00:10,628 --> 01:00:14,293
caused by the natural disease".

356
01:00:14,493 --> 01:00:21,093
He tries to explain and he uses words.

357
01:00:28,373 --> 01:00:45,278
That means the medicines you are giving not only obscures

358
01:00:45,478 --> 01:00:52,327
but extinguishes and thereby annihilates the derangement caused by

359
01:00:53,947 --> 01:00:55,785
the natural disease.

360
01:00:57,046 --> 01:01:02,279
"[...] This is so true that no previously existing disease can be cured,

361
01:01:02,479 --> 01:01:10,415
even by Nature herself, by the accession of a new dissimilar disease,

362
01:01:10,615 --> 01:01:18,260
be it ever so strong, and just as little can it be cured by medical treatment

363
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:23,915
with drugs which are incapable of producing a similar morbid condition

364
01:01:24,115 --> 01:01:26,215
in the healthy body."

365
01:01:26,415 --> 01:01:39,798
He says the cure can take place if the medicine can produce a similar disease

366
01:01:39,998 --> 01:01:42,960
in the human organism.

367
01:01:45,794 --> 01:01:51,759
But this cure cannot happen even by nature.

368
01:01:53,701 --> 01:02:01,413
The nature does not have the possibility to introduce into your organism

369
01:02:01,613 --> 01:02:09,901
a similar disease that can cure the previous one.

370
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:14,709
Later on he will bring some examples on that.

371
01:02:17,094 --> 01:02:20,903
"[...] no previously existing disease can be cured, even by Nature herself,

372
01:02:21,103 --> 01:02:30,824
by the accession, the incoming of a new dissimilar disease, be it ever so strong."

373
01:02:32,692 --> 01:02:37,689
If the new disease is dissimilar, the disease which you are having already,

374
01:02:39,050 --> 01:02:44,329
will remain there.

375
01:02:51,381 --> 01:02:59,604
And even less can be cured by medical treatment which is dissimilar

376
01:02:59,804 --> 01:03:06,762
to the problems of the patient.

377
01:03:06,962 --> 01:03:14,937
"In order to illustrate this, we shall consider in three different cases,

378
01:03:15,137 --> 01:03:24,467
as well what happens in nature when two dissimilar natural diseases meet together

379
01:03:24,667 --> 01:03:32,807
in one person, as also the result of the ordinary medical treatment of diseases

380
01:03:33,007 --> 01:03:39,020
with unsuitable allopathic drugs, which are incapable of producing

381
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:45,867
an artificial morbid condition, similar to the disease to be cured,

382
01:03:46,067 --> 01:03:52,489
whereby it will appear that even Nature herself is unable to remove

383
01:03:52,689 --> 01:04:00,445
a dissimilar disease already present by one that is unhomoeopathic,

384
01:04:00,645 --> 01:04:07,412
even though it be stronger, and just as little is the unhomoeopathic employment

385
01:04:07,612 --> 01:04:15,413
of even the strongest medicine ever capable of curing any disease whatsoever."

386
01:04:15,613 --> 01:04:27,550
He says, that if you give a dissimilar substance, it will never cure.

387
01:04:28,909 --> 01:04:31,977
And the same thing will happen in nature.

388
01:04:32,177 --> 01:04:38,217
If you have a disease and another dissimilar disease is coming,

389
01:04:38,417 --> 01:04:45,948
it cannot be cured. And he will say later on that each one

390
01:04:46,148 --> 01:04:53,087
will take its place in the organism, several disease may exist together

391
01:04:53,287 --> 01:05:00,558
in the same organism.

392
01:05:03,909 --> 01:05:15,656
When the one which is stronger will manifest mostly, the other which is the disease

393
01:05:15,856 --> 01:05:19,061
which is dissimilar but weaker will be subdued.

394
01:05:19,261 --> 01:05:31,956
And as soon as the stronger one is cured, the weaker one will come up again.

395
01:05:32,156 --> 01:05:41,403
Exactly the same thing that happens with allopathic drugs.

396
01:05:41,603 --> 01:05:48,358
Allopathic drugs are curing by dissimilar action.

397
01:05:48,558 --> 01:06:03,675
They are very powerful and they subdue, they suppress whatever is there,

398
01:06:03,875 --> 01:06:07,617
as disease manifestation, they do not see it anymore

399
01:06:07,817 --> 01:06:24,832
and they establish their own reign.

400
01:06:25,032 --> 01:06:34,635
What we know is that if we treat correctly a case, that has been suppressed

401
01:06:34,835 --> 01:06:45,404
by allopathic medicine, slowly the effect of this suppression will go away

402
01:06:45,604 --> 01:06:55,073
and there will come back the manifestation of the old disease that was there.

403
01:07:05,564 --> 01:07:12,782
" If the two dissimilar diseases meeting together in the human organism be of equal

404
01:07:12,982 --> 01:07:18,075
strength, or still more if the older one be the stronger, the new disease

405
01:07:18,275 --> 01:07:23,987
will be repelled by the old one from the body and not allowed to affect it.

406
01:07:24,187 --> 01:07:30,913
A patient suffering from a severe chronic disease will not be infected by a

407
01:07:31,113 --> 01:07:34,986
moderate autumnal dysentery..."

408
01:07:35,186 --> 01:07:51,448
This is what later on we discovered in the Levels of Health, where we say that

409
01:07:51,648 --> 01:08:07,463
if a person is chronically ill with a severe chronic disturbance, such a person

410
01:08:07,663 --> 01:08:23,068
cannot be affected by an acute, which is weaker than the already existing disease

411
01:08:23,268 --> 01:08:26,215
in the body.

412
01:08:34,496 --> 01:08:45,317
Hahnemann had very accurately observed that if a person was really chronically

413
01:08:45,517 --> 01:09:03,169
ill, with a strong disease, a weaker disease, influenza, enteritis, common cold

414
01:09:03,369 --> 01:09:13,210
or tonsillitis, all these acute conditions cannot affect an organism

415
01:09:13,410 --> 01:09:22,052
who is already sick in a chronic, serious condition.

416
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:31,707
This is something that Medicine has not realized.

417
01:09:31,907 --> 01:09:40,797
It has not realized that when they say, we give you these chemical drugs

418
01:09:40,997 --> 01:09:50,658
and repeat it again and again and there is a time when there are no more acutes,

419
01:09:50,858 --> 01:09:54,371
they feel they have done their duties.

420
01:09:54,571 --> 01:10:01,563
They have cured the person from chronic cystitis which was coming again and again,

421
01:10:01,763 --> 01:10:10,750
from chronic influenzas etc.

422
01:10:10,950 --> 01:10:17,407
Now we cured you. You don't get any more cystitis with fever

423
01:10:17,607 --> 01:10:30,289
but actually what happens is that the organism has become quite sick

424
01:10:30,489 --> 01:10:40,294
and therefore a stronger disease does not allow a milder disease to affect you.

425
01:11:16,478 --> 01:11:25,001
"So, also under ordinary medical treatment, an old chronic disease remains uncured

426
01:11:25,201 --> 01:11:34,821
and unaltered, if it is treated according to the common allopathic method.

427
01:11:41,486 --> 01:11:45,739
This is daily witnessed in practice, it is therefore unnecessary to give any

428
01:11:45,939 --> 01:11:47,934
illustrative examples."

429
01:11:59,144 --> 01:12:07,916
It's the same thing we say today that chemical drugs will not really cure

430
01:12:09,874 --> 01:12:13,419
any chronic condition.

431
01:12:20,154 --> 01:12:32,234
Chemical drugs will suppress but will not cure any chronic condition.

432
01:12:33,206 --> 01:12:46,406
You have asthma and you take bronchodilators, cortisone and you breathe better

433
01:12:46,606 --> 01:12:56,234
but this is only a temporary suppression of the symptomatology,

434
01:12:56,434 --> 01:13:04,496
it's a temporary alleviation of symptoms.

435
01:13:04,696 --> 01:13:14,757
But now the organism who is pushed every time with a chemical drug,

436
01:13:14,957 --> 01:13:26,819
what happens, at a certain moment it gives up and says I can't cope with this stress

437
01:13:27,019 --> 01:13:44,071
that drug is giving me anymore. Therefore I will put another level of defense

438
01:13:44,271 --> 01:13:48,864
which is on a deeper level and what is this deeper level of defense?

439
01:13:49,064 --> 01:14:03,565
It is a huge neurotic state, a serious depression, even a mental derangement

440
01:14:03,765 --> 01:14:13,965
and when he comes to you to be treated he is not suffering anymore with asthma.

441
01:14:14,165 --> 01:14:26,056
It comes with the neurotic symptoms, illusions, delusions, psychological problems,

442
01:14:26,256 --> 01:14:33,368
you give the remedy and then asthma comes back.

443
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:46,666
-Do you feel the same way about vitamins, herbs...? Can they suppress?

444
01:14:48,058 --> 01:14:49,842
-No, it's not the same in any way.

445
01:14:51,067 --> 01:15:01,847
And it's not always that allopathic drugs will suppress. Not always.

446
01:15:03,888 --> 01:15:12,046
Perhaps we can say most of the time but not always.

447
01:15:12,246 --> 01:15:22,492
Giving some support to the organism to deal with a problem like vitamins, herbs,

448
01:15:22,692 --> 01:15:31,533
better sleep, better diet, all these supporting things that you can be giving

449
01:15:31,733 --> 01:15:38,701
to the organism, you may help him to overcome the problem.

450
01:15:38,901 --> 01:15:46,621
In the same way sometimes, a supplement, even cortisone can affect a real cure.

451
01:15:46,821 --> 01:16:00,903
Giving cortisone which is due to the disturbance of the super renal glands

452
01:16:01,103 --> 01:16:09,309
which they don't produce the exact amount and you supply this amount

453
01:16:09,509 --> 01:16:19,436
and the person feels good and can breathe again and suddenly

454
01:16:19,636 --> 01:16:27,548
after a few months of treatment with cortisone, there is a big eruption arriving

455
01:16:27,748 --> 01:16:36,859
which was the initial cause of the asthma because it was suppressed.

456
01:16:37,059 --> 01:16:41,601
This can happen with allopathic drugs as well.

457
01:16:41,801 --> 01:16:50,270
The problem is that the doctors don't realize that this now is a good process

458
01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:58,917
and we have to be careful not to suppress again the skin eruption, the eczema.

459
01:16:59,117 --> 01:17:01,769
But what do they do? When the eczema comes

460
01:17:01,969 --> 01:17:09,943
"I have the eczema now, I have side effects from the cortisone".

461
01:17:10,143 --> 01:17:14,515
The doctor does not know to ask "Did you have such an eczema when

462
01:17:14,715 --> 01:17:22,383
you were a child? - Oh yes. - That's a very good process in your health."

463
01:17:22,583 --> 01:17:31,300
That means this is not a side effect from the drug. It is a process of cure.

464
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:36,814
They don't know it and they send it to the dermatologist and the dermatologist

465
01:17:37,014 --> 01:17:43,505
does a good job and in one week the eczema is disappearing

466
01:17:43,705 --> 01:17:50,863
and the asthma reappears and then the asthma comes back to you

467
01:17:51,063 --> 01:17:58,620
and you treat and you tell them it's very good that you have the eczema.

468
01:17:58,820 --> 01:18:03,508
So I give you a remedy and if the eczema comes back, it's a very good thing.

469
01:18:03,708 --> 01:18:11,332
Keep it and pray the eczema will come back.

470
01:18:12,996 --> 01:18:19,369
Sometimes people cannot tolerate these reactions.

471
01:18:19,569 --> 01:18:29,066
They come to you and they complain, I have this itching and I cannot sleep

472
01:18:29,266 --> 01:18:34,210
and you are trembling and you are trying to cure the asthma quickly.

473
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:38,667
And then you make mistakes because you give one remedy after another and

474
01:18:38,867 --> 01:18:48,294
then back again the asthma instead of waiting.

475
01:18:50,108 --> 01:19:00,256
I remember a case with a boy and Roger Morrison was studying with me in Athens

476
01:19:00,456 --> 01:19:06,357
and he had the case. He brought me the case and says

477
01:19:06,557 --> 01:19:14,035
"George the parents say that they have not slept for 10 days because all night

478
01:19:14,235 --> 01:19:21,786
the boy is scratching and the parents are awake trying to relieve him, please

479
01:19:21,986 --> 01:19:29,618
don't scratch, because we have told them not to do anything.

480
01:19:29,818 --> 01:19:35,042
And he comes to me desperate and says, I cannot see the remedy

481
01:19:35,242 --> 01:19:44,380
and I said, I'm sorry I cannot see the remedy and then after a week they come back

482
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:48,667
and they say the boy has these symptoms.

483
01:19:48,867 --> 01:19:56,211
I said that's Arsenicum, give Arsenicum tonight. The same night the boy slept.

484
01:19:56,411 --> 01:20:04,712
After a few days the eczema disappeared, the asthma also.

485
01:20:04,912 --> 01:20:09,894
So the boy was cured from asthma was cured and for the rest of his life did not

486
01:20:10,094 --> 01:20:12,789
suffer of it. Can you imagine all this?

487
01:20:12,989 --> 01:20:20,123
That this is possible, that there is a way to treat logically and he has given

488
01:20:20,323 --> 01:20:29,282
all the information possible, as long as long you have understood this.

489
01:20:29,482 --> 01:20:35,884
It's so important for a homeopath to have understood the Organon.

490
01:20:37,758 --> 01:20:47,438
And I'm really sad to see homeopaths who never read the Organon.

491
01:20:49,419 --> 01:21:00,888
They say, what is the Organon? I don't understand what the Organon is.

492
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:14,396
Do you want to ask a question? You have a lot of questions? This is good.

493
01:21:21,928 --> 01:21:28,539
-What you have just said, does it mean that if you have a patient with cancer

494
01:21:28,739 --> 01:21:35,400
having chemotherapy and you have the side effect of a very itchy skin eruption

495
01:21:37,190 --> 01:21:38,710
that would be a good effect?

496
01:21:39,274 --> 01:21:40,480
-Good effect.

497
01:21:41,625 --> 01:21:49,696
-And then you would stop the chemotherapy at this point, shouldn't you?

498
01:21:53,573 --> 01:22:00,190
-Today we have ways of knowing and we have possibilities to see

499
01:22:00,390 --> 01:22:09,389
whether there is a retraction by the markers, by the MRI, laboratory examinations,

500
01:22:09,589 --> 01:22:20,676
we know whether this is only an allergic reaction, because it can be.

501
01:22:20,876 --> 01:22:27,852
That means the chemotherapy contains something to which the person is allergic

502
01:22:28,052 --> 01:22:32,328
and it can have an allergic reaction. This is different.

503
01:22:32,528 --> 01:22:40,366
But if the person says I feel better and the pains have been reduced

504
01:22:40,566 --> 01:22:47,739
and the tumor also starts reducing, the markers are better and

505
01:22:50,020 --> 01:23:01,746
there is a severe skin eruption, yes you can say it is a curative process.

506
01:23:05,671 --> 01:23:10,907
-I was going to ask if one can differentiate when the cortisone or any other

507
01:23:11,107 --> 01:23:16,252
allopathic remedy has a curative effect or if it is just a reaction?

508
01:23:16,452 --> 01:23:20,199
So you said, you need to ask if the person is feeling better.

509
01:23:20,399 --> 01:23:25,829
If the person feels better and has a skin eruption is not an allergic reaction.

510
01:23:26,029 --> 01:23:29,224
Is there any other signs that we can...?

511
01:23:29,424 --> 01:23:37,105
-There are some other signs which you can be certain that the cortisone

512
01:23:37,305 --> 01:23:41,125
or the chemotherapy has acted.

513
01:23:41,325 --> 01:23:47,387
I said you have the markers, you are checking, you have the pain,

514
01:23:47,587 --> 01:23:53,242
which has been reduced, you have the general condition of the patient,

515
01:23:53,442 --> 01:24:02,162
you have the MRI that you will see the reduction of the tumor...

516
01:24:02,362 --> 01:24:08,911
You calculate all these together to make a decision

517
01:24:09,111 --> 01:24:12,868
whether this was a curative reaction.

518
01:24:14,865 --> 01:24:20,136
-When Hahnemann was presenting how he understands the homeopathic process,

519
01:24:20,336 --> 01:24:26,109
he was saying the remedy was doing the action, it's overwhelming the disease

520
01:24:26,309 --> 01:24:32,397
but the way you present how you understand it, you say actually

521
01:24:32,597 --> 01:24:34,693
the vital force is doing the work...

522
01:24:34,893 --> 01:24:45,175
-Exactly. We stimulate the vital force which does the reaction.

523
01:24:45,375 --> 01:24:52,110
Not that the homeopathic remedy comes from the outside and gets hold

524
01:24:52,310 --> 01:24:55,947
of the weaker and throws it out, not in this way.

525
01:24:56,147 --> 01:25:03,388
We stimulate the vital force and the vital force takes extra force

526
01:25:03,588 --> 01:25:17,504
to fight the disease and that is the explanation why we see initial aggravations.

527
01:25:17,704 --> 01:25:25,889
Otherwise you cannot explain the initial aggravation.

528
01:25:26,089 --> 01:25:35,765
In chronic headaches, the persons says you gave me a remedy and this time

529
01:25:35,965 --> 01:25:44,542
my headache was the worst ever. You say, very good the remedy was correct, wait.

530
01:25:44,742 --> 01:25:48,447
You know what you are doing. Once you know the Theory,

531
01:25:48,647 --> 01:25:53,439
you know what you are doing and until you know the Theory,

532
01:25:53,639 --> 01:25:55,798
then you cannot really cure.

533
01:25:55,998 --> 01:26:00,907
You may give correct remedies and then spoil the case later on.

534
01:26:01,107 --> 01:26:07,783
Because you don't know how to proceed.

535
01:26:10,651 --> 01:26:14,693
-There is a mechanical analog to what you are saying. So if this is a straight line

536
01:26:14,893 --> 01:26:19,024
of health and there is a deviation from health towards one direction,

537
01:26:19,224 --> 01:26:23,174
let's say to the right, then if you want to bring back to the straight,

538
01:26:23,374 --> 01:26:27,590
you have to pull that so it gets back...

539
01:26:27,790 --> 01:26:34,427
-I didn't understand your mechanic model. Repeat.

540
01:26:34,627 --> 01:26:44,524
-If you put the force, it has a force to come back again to the straight...

541
01:26:44,724 --> 01:26:50,526
-The force of the disease is pulling one direction...

542
01:26:50,726 --> 01:26:59,868
-This is the straight line of health. But in disease there is a deviation to one side

543
01:27:00,068 --> 01:27:06,745
let's say. If you want to bring it back to the straight line, you have to pull it a bit more

544
01:27:06,945 --> 01:27:10,830
so it gets the force to get come back...

545
01:27:11,030 --> 01:27:14,803
-And the organism brings it back. You can say that, as long as you understand,

546
01:27:15,003 --> 01:27:33,992
that the homeopathic remedy is not suppressing but on the contrary

547
01:27:34,192 --> 01:27:43,018
is triggering the reaction and pushes more.

548
01:27:52,269 --> 01:28:03,808
I'm hot now and my organism has to react. It has to bring balance.

549
01:28:04,008 --> 01:28:13,518
It says you are very hot. What does it do? Some reaction, it makes me perspire

550
01:28:13,718 --> 01:28:19,206
so I can cool off eventually through the perspiration.

551
01:28:19,406 --> 01:28:30,321
He has to do that otherwise, I will have thermoplexia.

552
01:28:30,521 --> 01:28:41,160
If the organism cannot do that, that means it cannot bring out symptoms

553
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:49,781
to relieve the heat, what happens...

554
01:28:49,981 --> 01:29:01,389
I have a sunstroke, then I fall off and I faint in the seaside and the people

555
01:29:01,589 --> 01:29:07,569
are bringing the person here.

556
01:29:11,633 --> 01:29:18,920
The organism did not have forces to react and to perspire and to bring

557
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:24,651
all the other chemical reactions that are needed to counteract the heat.

558
01:29:24,851 --> 01:29:32,056
The organism did not have that, therefore it has sunstroke and the person is out.

559
01:29:32,256 --> 01:29:44,510
You give the remedy and then there is a perspiration and the person comes back.

560
01:29:44,710 --> 01:29:57,449
It helps him to bring out the peculiar symptoms that are needed in order to cure itself.

561
01:29:57,649 --> 01:30:05,467
That means you are pushing the organism towards the right direction.

562
01:30:05,667 --> 01:30:11,540
Who was here, I think it was the Italian group?

563
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:21,945
They brought somebody with sunstroke, he was almost collapsing.

564
01:30:22,145 --> 01:30:27,475
In sunstroke we have remedies like Natrum carbonicum, Glonoinum, Belladona,

565
01:30:27,675 --> 01:30:36,878
Natrum muriaticum etc. The class gets very excited, the person is like this.

566
01:30:37,078 --> 01:30:49,848
I go there and I touch him a little bit and I see has a mild cold perspiration

567
01:30:50,048 --> 01:30:53,973
and I say, give him Carbo vegetabilis 200CH.

568
01:30:55,646 --> 01:31:03,469
In 5 minutes the person was sitting there attending the class.

569
01:31:03,669 --> 01:31:16,435
What you do is you help the organism to reestablish itself through symptoms

570
01:31:16,635 --> 01:31:19,400
which are good for the organism.

571
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:30,877
Not every organism develops the same symptoms in all conditions.

572
01:31:33,954 --> 01:31:39,000
Some organism will develop a severe headache.

573
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:54,740
He may be out of order completely under the sun because of a severe headache.

574
01:31:54,940 --> 01:32:01,992
For that you do not give Carbo vegetabilis, you have to give Glonoinum.

575
01:32:02,192 --> 01:32:12,199
Glonoinum will make his headache a little bit stronger for a moment and then is over.

576
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:25,337
-If the right remedy pushes the vital force, what does the wrong remedy do?

577
01:32:27,935 --> 01:32:30,242
-That's a good question.

578
01:32:35,939 --> 01:32:44,091
You have 800 remedies, if you put them on a vibrational rate,

579
01:32:45,721 --> 01:32:49,898
you will see the remedy that the person needs is here, on that rate.

580
01:32:50,098 --> 01:33:02,493
Left and right of this vibrational rate are close vibrational remedies.

581
01:33:02,693 --> 01:33:12,594
If you give a very close one, you will push the organism and then a second one

582
01:33:12,794 --> 01:33:19,020
and the third may bring the organism back into order.

583
01:33:19,220 --> 01:33:26,894
The more distance you are giving a remedy from the correct one,

584
01:33:27,094 --> 01:33:31,719
the less is going to be the effect.

585
01:33:31,919 --> 01:33:43,245
If the remedy is totally out, no effect. The worse is the remedy to be not very close

586
01:33:43,445 --> 01:33:52,399
but to be close enough as to bring about some changes. These changes are not good.

587
01:33:55,559 --> 01:34:03,284
But if the remedy is quite close, it will push the organism towards a more correct

588
01:34:03,484 --> 01:34:06,870
picture.

589
01:34:11,288 --> 01:34:12,378
-Can we suppress with a remedy?

590
01:34:14,460 --> 01:34:19,519
-Yes, you can suppress with the wrong remedy, if it is near.

591
01:34:20,735 --> 01:34:25,159
-The first time, or do you have to have several remedies?

592
01:34:25,359 --> 01:34:28,320
-You can suppress the first time, the second time...

593
01:34:28,520 --> 01:34:38,541
You can suppress with a remedy that it is near, which means that it will be changing

594
01:34:38,741 --> 01:34:48,302
the symptoms of the person without the person feeling better.

595
01:34:48,502 --> 01:34:54,457
And you just change. A headache from right goes to the left.

596
01:34:54,657 --> 01:35:00,758
Then you have to wait. The organism will bring it back by itself if you wait.

597
01:35:00,958 --> 01:35:06,969
But in this way you can suppress but not suppress in the way that a chemical drug

598
01:35:07,169 --> 01:35:15,253
will suppress. A chemical drug will suppress forever and will keep you

599
01:35:15,453 --> 01:35:19,873
under its effect for 20 years.

600
01:35:30,189 --> 01:35:38,988
-I didn't understand how cortisone or chemotherapy can have a cure.

601
01:35:39,188 --> 01:35:47,262
Is it like a homeopathic medicine? Does cortisone act like a homeopathic remedy?

602
01:35:48,756 --> 01:35:49,876
-Can you speak little bit louder?

603
01:35:52,599 --> 01:36:03,617
-I don't understand how cortisone or chemotherapy can have a curative action.

604
01:36:03,817 --> 01:36:09,490
Does it act as an homeopathic remedy?

605
01:36:09,690 --> 01:36:19,230
-Yes. The possibility is that in these chemicals, there is one chemical structure

606
01:36:19,430 --> 01:36:27,756
which is needed by the organism and takes a mother tincture of that remedy.

607
01:36:27,956 --> 01:36:31,045
It's like treating with mother tinctures.

608
01:36:31,245 --> 01:36:42,384
But being a similar within these different elements of the allopathic drug

609
01:36:42,584 --> 01:36:48,201
which contains a lot of different elements, one element it may happen

610
01:36:48,401 --> 01:37:01,796
to be indicated as a similar remedy or maybe there are some other functions

611
01:37:01,996 --> 01:37:06,238
we do not understand yet.

612
01:37:09,344 --> 01:37:15,722
I do not say that I know everything and know how this can happen.

613
01:37:15,922 --> 01:37:22,797
What I know are facts. People have come and said I have taken a little bit

614
01:37:22,997 --> 01:37:25,794
of cortisone and I feel great.

615
01:37:25,994 --> 01:37:32,843
And I examine them and in all respect mental, emotional, physical, very good state.

616
01:37:33,043 --> 01:37:45,493
Keep on this remedy. So the replacing of this very little cortisone brings

617
01:37:45,693 --> 01:37:51,980
the organism into a perfect condition. You keep it. I don't change it.

618
01:37:52,180 --> 01:37:57,146
I don't say stop this and I will give you a remedy.

619
01:37:57,346 --> 01:38:12,933
In the same way, I have seen cases with deep psychological problems,

620
01:38:13,133 --> 01:38:21,028
even with schizophrenia that have been given remedies which have produced

621
01:38:21,228 --> 01:38:24,402
severe skin eruptions.

622
01:38:24,602 --> 01:38:37,489
And during these eruptions the person feels his mind is clear

623
01:38:37,689 --> 01:38:43,161
and the correct doctor should say this is a curative action

624
01:38:43,361 --> 01:38:46,006
and this remedy is good for you.

625
01:38:46,206 --> 01:38:51,318
It doesn't matter because I'm a homeopath and he has been given

626
01:38:51,518 --> 01:38:55,474
an allopathic drug...

627
01:38:55,674 --> 01:39:02,683
These are only ideas, it's not reality.

628
01:39:02,883 --> 01:39:09,478
The reality is that this medication has tremendously helped this severely ill person.

629
01:39:09,678 --> 01:39:13,996
Keep it. This is good for you.

630
01:39:14,196 --> 01:39:18,917
-What about a person who is helped by cortisone to take potentized cortisone?

631
01:39:19,117 --> 01:39:23,337
Have you tried it?

632
01:39:23,537 --> 01:39:29,679
-No. I will not stop the cortisone of a person who feels very good

633
01:39:29,879 --> 01:39:37,902
under a little bit of cortisone, I am talking 3-4 mg.

634
01:39:38,102 --> 01:39:42,179
I have seen cases that they are doing well with this very little cortisone.

635
01:39:42,379 --> 01:39:48,041
I will not stop it and give it potentized cortisone. I've never done it.
