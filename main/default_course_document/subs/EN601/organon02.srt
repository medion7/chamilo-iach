1
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:32,478
Paragraph, aphorism 4. Who has the Organon? Very good.

2
00:00:36,446 --> 00:00:39,068
Who has read the Organon right through?

3
00:00:52,255 --> 00:01:06,639
Who has read the sub-notes in the Organon? Good. So you don't need me.

4
00:01:10,468 --> 00:01:16,343
That is Ok. I just give you some ideas, some perspective in some aspects.

5
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:32,671
"He is likewise a preserver of health if he knows the things that derange health

6
00:01:34,114 --> 00:01:41,405
and cause disease and how to remove them from persons in health".

7
00:01:43,487 --> 00:01:51,480
There is wrong translation. "[..] and know to remove them from persons in health"

8
00:01:57,836 --> 00:02:00,789
so the persons can become healthy, this is what it means of course.

9
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,617
"[...]if he knows the things that derange health".

10
00:02:19,876 --> 00:02:30,201
By the time he was writing the Organon, they knew very few things that one could

11
00:02:31,749 --> 00:02:40,636
say "deranges health". They did not know about the microbes, about bacteria,

12
00:02:42,585 --> 00:02:49,452
about the different things which we know today. So what does he mean?

13
00:02:54,296 --> 00:02:56,733
Can anybody tell me?

14
00:02:59,527 --> 00:03:03,892
He says "[..]a preserver of health if he knows the things that derange health".

15
00:03:07,077 --> 00:03:11,403
It's a big statement. He must have had something in his mind when he wrote this.

16
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:18,053
Things that derange health. We know that for instance bad food can derange health.

17
00:03:20,913 --> 00:03:29,153
This kind of things. And exposing someone to the cold. Is that what he means?

18
00:03:30,861 --> 00:03:41,069
Or he means something more? He means most probably, he is a pre-runner of his

19
00:03:42,095 --> 00:03:45,308
ideas concerning the miasms.

20
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:01,013
He goes further and says "Useful to the physician in assisting him to cure are the

21
00:04:02,499 --> 00:04:10,385
particulars of the most probable exciting cause of the acute disease, as also the

22
00:04:11,738 --> 00:04:16,791
most significant points and the whole history of the chronic disease, to enable him

23
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:25,215
to discover its fundamental cause, which is generally due to a chronic miasm.

24
00:04:32,029 --> 00:04:39,548
In these investigations, the ascertainable physical constitution of the patient

25
00:04:43,613 --> 00:04:47,533
(especially when the disease is chronic), his moral and intellectual character,

26
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:55,011
his occupation, mode of living and habits, his social and domestic relations,

27
00:04:56,853 --> 00:05:02,522
his age, sexual function etc. are to be taken into consideration".

28
00:05:06,777 --> 00:05:15,415
In one paragraph he gives all the factors that we discussed already that could

29
00:05:17,742 --> 00:05:19,145
derange the health of the person.

30
00:05:25,593 --> 00:05:36,461
And the first thing he says is the general constitution of the patient.

31
00:05:37,681 --> 00:05:45,163
That means he has noticed that if a person had a good constitution,

32
00:05:46,027 --> 00:05:47,612
his treatment would be easy.

33
00:05:53,461 --> 00:05:58,156
If his constitution was weak, his treatment would be much more difficult.

34
00:06:00,775 --> 00:06:03,317
"[...]especially when the disease is chronic".

35
00:06:04,936 --> 00:06:12,302
Constitution is connected with chronic condition. But one of the first things he makes

36
00:06:15,296 --> 00:06:19,879
is his moral and intellectual character.

37
00:06:24,636 --> 00:06:32,769
What could derange health is the moral and intellectual character.

38
00:06:36,714 --> 00:06:42,335
What could be the cause of his disease is the moral and intellectual character.

39
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:55,067
You see how clear he is in his mind. He has perceived in depth what was happening

40
00:06:56,649 --> 00:07:05,278
in the human organism in 1810. Not today, after all we know.

41
00:07:08,832 --> 00:07:21,121
I can tell you that this paragraph is so important to understand, for a physician

42
00:07:22,572 --> 00:07:33,769
who is treating cases, to understand why a case would be very difficult to cure.

43
00:07:36,138 --> 00:07:40,345
Moral character bad. It means you get a patient.

44
00:07:43,676 --> 00:07:55,186
He comes to your office with recommendations, this is an important person,

45
00:07:56,074 --> 00:08:03,675
very rich person. Pay special attention to him.

46
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:21,061
And he comes and he has the air of the boss. He is the boss of everybody.

47
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,272
He pays money to everybody. So he has learned to be like this.

48
00:08:28,253 --> 00:08:33,426
What he wants from you is just quickly fix this little problem which I have...

49
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:52,947
So I cannot lose my time with you. You realize the life of such a person.

50
00:08:54,597 --> 00:08:59,871
What it really is. Lots of money, lots of women, a lot of corruption.

51
00:09:01,469 --> 00:09:07,046
He has corrupted others. And he thinks everything is easy.

52
00:09:09,471 --> 00:09:12,592
Everything is his own birth right.

53
00:09:15,894 --> 00:09:24,361
So such people will be very difficult to treat, unfortunately.

54
00:09:26,784 --> 00:09:33,892
Never mind how much you may want to help them. This is going to be very difficult.

55
00:09:35,881 --> 00:09:44,302
Why? Because the corruption of their soul is so deep that it is not a kind of morality,

56
00:09:46,266 --> 00:09:51,778
his moral character, it's a case of reality.

57
00:09:55,426 --> 00:10:12,228
This person who is this and that and so strong, so rich... he has stepped on other

58
00:10:13,598 --> 00:10:19,927
humans, he has pushed them down. Perhaps he has committed crimes.

59
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:29,883
He appears as if everything is Ok. "Just give me the remedy so I can go".

60
00:10:31,739 --> 00:10:41,816
But you realize that this person has a life which is not clean at all.

61
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:55,147
And you can see in his face, you can see in the mode of the expression, in his

62
00:10:56,568 --> 00:10:58,896
intellectual capacity...

63
00:11:10,242 --> 00:11:17,188
Most probably Hahnemann had similar experiences.

64
00:11:18,981 --> 00:11:26,008
That's why he says the moral character. Be careful! Examine his moral character.

65
00:11:26,994 --> 00:11:30,771
You cannot examine the moral character because everybody will say "I'm the best,

66
00:11:32,152 --> 00:11:36,688
I give money, I support people, I do this and that". What they will say about

67
00:11:37,579 --> 00:11:44,800
themselves is what they think they are. It's not what the other self which is deep,

68
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:58,094
which is watching all the time says to him even in a subconscious level, but it's not

69
00:11:59,074 --> 00:12:00,636
even in a conscious level but on subconscious level tells him

70
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:13,253
"Wait. You are a bastard. You are a criminal". Such people will be difficult to cure.

71
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:22,254
I can tell you. They are very clever people because they have been successful in the

72
00:12:24,129 --> 00:12:30,720
society. They have attained position, politicians with great power.

73
00:12:35,438 --> 00:12:47,958
And high judges and whatever. If these people come to you, you are an unlucky

74
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:57,487
homeopath. I can tell you, though it may appear that you have the best clients

75
00:12:59,418 --> 00:13:04,105
and the most powerful. Because they are dangerous at the same time.

76
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:10,434
Because the moment you will not deliver what they think they should get... Because

77
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:27,070
they will not give you the ordinary money. So they expect that they will get the

78
00:13:28,786 --> 00:13:33,100
equivalent of what they paid. The more I paid the more I will be better.

79
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:38,005
It's not like this. It's the opposite.

80
00:13:43,146 --> 00:13:52,505
It's unbelievable in real practice how you realize what Hahnemann has written.

81
00:13:56,267 --> 00:14:01,530
The genius he was. He says "intellectual character, his occupation".

82
00:14:04,858 --> 00:14:10,476
What are you doing? There are people who are doing nothing today.

83
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:19,272
They just sit in their office and they have a computer and the millions come.

84
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:29,981
They realize this is not something moral for the world.

85
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:40,777
It's an expression. They don't really realize but on a deeper level they know this is a

86
00:14:41,609 --> 00:14:49,316
very immoral thing what I am doing. Because I am stealing the people of the country.

87
00:14:52,067 --> 00:14:54,112
This is the idea. This is what he says, the occupation.

88
00:15:00,188 --> 00:15:06,352
And there comes a man, a carpenter who build these chairs.

89
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:13,772
I never expected such heavy chairs, such a nice office. You see here how nice it is?

90
00:15:19,684 --> 00:15:27,030
He worked for three months. How much it costs? So much. Logical price you pay.

91
00:15:30,007 --> 00:15:42,750
And he is an artist. A very honest working man who produced this creation and he just

92
00:15:43,915 --> 00:15:46,338
asked for some money to live his family.

93
00:15:49,716 --> 00:16:04,009
"[...]mode of living and habits, his social and domestic relations".

94
00:16:06,338 --> 00:16:13,691
Another very important area in which conflict arises quite easily.

95
00:16:17,586 --> 00:16:22,080
You cannot live forever. You become old and die.

96
00:16:24,502 --> 00:16:32,817
You cannot...an old man comes and says "make me feel 16 year old. I'm sorry sir,

97
00:16:35,346 --> 00:16:48,728
I cannot do it". "[...] sexual function etc.". This sexuality is also a big issue

98
00:16:53,717 --> 00:17:08,506
because the preservation instinct and the instinct of procreation are very powerful,

99
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:16,343
both. So if somebody feels secure and good about these two issues, I have enough

100
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:24,966
money to support my family and my sexual needs are covered.

101
00:17:27,587 --> 00:17:37,976
That person is a balanced person. Anxiety about money and how to support

102
00:17:39,265 --> 00:17:54,018
my family and also insecurities concerning the acceptance as a human being

103
00:17:55,637 --> 00:17:57,836
by others are very powerful issues.

104
00:18:17,857 --> 00:18:24,748
"The unprejudiced observer". There are two other things that he tells here.

105
00:18:26,885 --> 00:18:40,238
The exciting cause and fundamental cause. Exciting cause is what triggers acute

106
00:18:42,505 --> 00:18:55,692
diseases. The microbes, the bacteria, the poisonous food, the pollution of the air.

107
00:18:57,413 --> 00:19:05,739
That is the exciting cause. But he said except of the exciting cause there is something

108
00:19:07,377 --> 00:19:16,690
which is underneath which is the fundamental cause or the maintaining cause.

109
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:26,044
Which actually he predicted the whole idea, genetic idea, which has come the last

110
00:19:27,503 --> 00:19:32,224
30-40 years concerning the genetic predisposition.

111
00:19:35,326 --> 00:19:42,714
This is exactly what he found out by simply observing his patients.

112
00:19:44,553 --> 00:19:52,147
Here he says there is an exciting cause, there is something which excites a condition,

113
00:19:53,878 --> 00:20:01,211
but also there is a fundamental cause which is behind this and to which he will

114
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:10,708
attribute the different miasms. The miasmatic theory is nothing else than the theory

115
00:20:11,935 --> 00:20:16,857
of genetic predisposition, which we all know today.

116
00:20:22,856 --> 00:20:33,240
And in paragraph 6 he says "The unprejudiced observer - well aware of the futility

117
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:41,703
of transcendental speculations which can receive no confirmation from experience..."

118
00:20:44,974 --> 00:21:00,864
He had also a problem with people who are just bringing up theories, ideas

119
00:21:02,439 --> 00:21:06,549
which have nothing to do with the practical issue of curing people.

120
00:21:10,945 --> 00:21:19,261
"The unprejudiced observer". He who has no prejudice.

121
00:21:24,888 --> 00:21:29,012
The homeopathic physician should not have any prejudice.

122
00:21:40,657 --> 00:21:47,065
The diet is an important factor in paying attention for better health.

123
00:21:48,638 --> 00:21:55,321
You have to examine it and if it is correct you have to accept it.

124
00:21:58,955 --> 00:22:05,555
There's nobody today who argues with this, the kind of food we eat is very important.

125
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:21,776
There is another system of therapy which is called acupuncture. Do I have evidence?

126
00:22:23,538 --> 00:22:36,118
Yes, Ok. There is another thing which is called osteopathy, chiropractors

127
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:42,598
manipulating the spine. Do I have evidence? Yes. Accept it.

128
00:22:46,218 --> 00:22:52,536
If you are prejudiced, nothing works except of Homeopathy...

129
00:23:04,725 --> 00:23:11,168
"[...]  be his powers of penetration ever so great, takes note of nothing in every

130
00:23:12,379 --> 00:23:17,671
individual disease except the changes in the health of the body and of the mind".

131
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:30,146
For a homeopath he says, if you are unprejudiced, you look upon in an open mind

132
00:23:31,678 --> 00:23:37,407
and you take into consideration the changes in body and mind.

133
00:23:39,361 --> 00:23:45,047
This is the pathology you are interested in. Sometimes we say which symptoms should

134
00:23:46,554 --> 00:23:48,219
be taken into consideration?

135
00:23:49,731 --> 00:23:55,451
You should take into consideration the changes that have happened in a certain period

136
00:23:56,848 --> 00:24:05,161
in the life of the person. I'm a happy person and because of an incident I lost my lover,

137
00:24:08,232 --> 00:24:14,873
my child and I've become another person. This is the change.

138
00:24:16,261 --> 00:24:19,178
This you should take into consideration.

139
00:24:25,345 --> 00:24:34,427
I was digesting everything, now I cannot eat cheese, I cannot eat onions, I cannot eat

140
00:24:35,304 --> 00:24:41,439
tomatoes, I cannot eat sweets, my stomach is upset. These are changes you have to

141
00:24:42,196 --> 00:24:54,255
take into consideration. This specifies what are the symptoms you have to take into

142
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:56,987
consideration.

143
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:05,929
What is the problem with us today when we see chronic cases and of quite deep

144
00:25:07,264 --> 00:25:10,837
character? What is the problem? Who can tell me?

145
00:25:12,503 --> 00:25:21,585
-We have symptoms from different levels and we cannot have a clear picture which

146
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,776
symptom we have to choose.

147
00:25:26,111 --> 00:25:28,585
-Very good! That's correct. I will say the same thing in a different way.

148
00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:38,616
From the moment somebody is born and they start giving vaccinations, antibiotics

149
00:25:39,884 --> 00:25:49,730
etc. changes start. Later on he has an acute. Later on more changes happen because

150
00:25:51,261 --> 00:25:55,401
of some effects, of some incidents in the life of the person.

151
00:25:57,112 --> 00:26:03,971
He gets acutes, he gets some frights, he gets some problems, the problems are

152
00:26:05,707 --> 00:26:12,148
changing his mood, changing his character and then more problems, more changes

153
00:26:13,847 --> 00:26:22,178
and when they arrive to us, there is not one set of changes that you can be aware of

154
00:26:24,099 --> 00:26:27,078
and be clear. That would be easy.

155
00:26:29,516 --> 00:26:43,131
If a person has lived a normal, healthy life and he is a villager in the mountains, strong,

156
00:26:44,675 --> 00:26:54,176
was eating good, natural products but one day he was tired, he had to milk the cows

157
00:26:56,589 --> 00:27:06,520
and it was raining and he got wet, he comes with a lumbago.

158
00:27:08,848 --> 00:27:15,978
This man comes with a lumbago, I can tell you the case will be so clear.

159
00:27:18,041 --> 00:27:23,337
One remedy and the next day he will back to his village working.

160
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:35,374
No changes and after changes... we have in the cities. In the city of London,

161
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:47,454
in the city of Athens, in the city of Paris and all these terrible cities.

162
00:27:50,663 --> 00:27:55,727
"[...]except the changes in the health of the body and of the mind [...]which can

163
00:27:59,296 --> 00:28:07,832
be perceived externally by means of the senses; that is to say, he notices only the

164
00:28:08,587 --> 00:28:13,752
deviations from the former healthy state of the now diseased individual, which are felt

165
00:28:14,869 --> 00:28:21,667
by the patient himself". These changes, he says, can be felt by the patient himself

166
00:28:26,117 --> 00:28:36,268
remarked by those around him. This is information that you need.

167
00:28:39,244 --> 00:28:47,535
What the patient will tell you, you ask the wife also because you will ask the patient

168
00:28:50,036 --> 00:28:51,979
"Are you irritable?" because you suspect this is a case of Nux-vomica.

169
00:28:53,308 --> 00:29:03,545
"Are you irritable? -No." and the wife makes like this and says "Ok...".

170
00:29:05,716 --> 00:29:13,521
I told you a professor of surgery, another of his surgeons was sitting next to me in the

171
00:29:15,506 --> 00:29:18,709
chair and I was taking his case and I asked him this question.

172
00:29:20,916 --> 00:29:31,122
I perceived this was a Nux-v. case. He can be irritable. So his student had seen him in

173
00:29:32,588 --> 00:29:41,679
operation and how he behaved and then I say "Are you irritable? -No, I'm very calm".

174
00:29:43,166 --> 00:29:48,604
George kicks me under the chair and says be careful.

175
00:29:50,761 --> 00:29:57,352
"And finally observed by the physician". There are 3 sources of information.

176
00:29:58,929 --> 00:30:04,408
The patient himself, the people around him and what the physician observes.

177
00:30:06,185 --> 00:30:13,912
All of them are important information that we should have in every case if possible.

178
00:30:15,485 --> 00:30:20,911
It's not possible every time. Because people when they see you they want to speak

179
00:30:22,659 --> 00:30:28,580
without anybody around. They want to be only themselves. Why?

180
00:30:30,694 --> 00:30:36,286
Because they don't want anybody else to know what's going on inside them.

181
00:30:42,422 --> 00:30:47,358
They will ask "Go out". If they say "go out" the case will be difficult.

182
00:30:51,695 --> 00:31:02,289
If the person says "No, I don't mind, my wife can stay" the case is going to be easier

183
00:31:06,012 --> 00:31:15,485
but if they know what you are going to ask...because if they do it in their ignorance of

184
00:31:17,431 --> 00:31:22,030
what kind of information we need, that's a different story.

185
00:31:23,592 --> 00:31:27,820
Because by the time they realize that you are asking difficult questions, the wife herself

186
00:31:29,825 --> 00:31:37,979
opens the door and goes out says "it's better you stay and tell the story yourself".

187
00:31:44,315 --> 00:31:52,335
"[..]All these perceptible signs represent the disease in its whole extent".

188
00:31:55,698 --> 00:32:00,802
Hahnemann actually says if you have all this information, you know everything about

189
00:32:01,972 --> 00:32:08,549
that character, about that constitution, you don't need anything more, this is the whole

190
00:32:08,749 --> 00:32:27,017
extent of his disease. What about laboratory tests? Do we need?

191
00:32:28,485 --> 00:32:38,908
Yes, we need laboratory tests. Mostly to know the depth of the pathology and also not

192
00:32:40,922 --> 00:32:53,138
to make a mistake and misunderstand what's going on with an organism who is quite

193
00:32:54,585 --> 00:33:01,295
undermined with pathology and you don't realize it and you give a very high potency,

194
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,672
there is a big reaction and all kinds of other things can happen.

195
00:33:13,748 --> 00:33:24,635
Actually today we are using all possible diagnostic tools that exist with conventional

196
00:33:26,357 --> 00:33:32,861
medicine and we have to know what possibilities there are. We must ask also if we are

197
00:33:34,427 --> 00:33:44,778
not very sure about the pathology. Of course the homeopath learns to diagnose a case

198
00:33:46,155 --> 00:33:48,424
through the symptomatology.

199
00:33:50,955 --> 00:34:01,779
"[... ]that is, together they form the true and only conceivable portrait of the disease".

200
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:20,028
Do you want to ask any question so far, paragraph 6? So we can go to paragraph 7.

201
00:34:21,461 --> 00:34:23,556
More complicated paragraphs.

202
00:34:31,637 --> 00:34:40,100
"Now, as in a disease, from which no manifest exciting or maintaining cause

203
00:34:41,731 --> 00:34:46,263
(causa occasionalis) has to be removed, we can perceive nothing but the morbid

204
00:34:47,451 --> 00:34:58,255
symptoms, it must be the symptoms alone by which the disease demands and points to

205
00:35:00,044 --> 00:35:01,903
the remedy suited to relieve it".

206
00:35:03,842 --> 00:35:16,880
If actually there is no an external cause or a cause that maybe it is the exciting cause,

207
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:30,901
you have a woman who wants to be looking better, they press themselves with

208
00:35:33,656 --> 00:35:39,535
different things and due to pressure they can have a swollen feet. You just tell them

209
00:35:41,502 --> 00:35:54,245
to release the thing... When there is a bandage and there is a swelling you just release

210
00:35:56,076 --> 00:35:58,616
the bandage to relieve the swelling. This is what he means.

211
00:36:00,216 --> 00:36:05,833
He says unless you have found such a cause which is obvious and you have

212
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:14,978
to remove it, then the only thing that constitutes disease are the totality of

213
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:30,339
the symptoms. That is the disease of the person. Mental and physical.

214
00:36:32,036 --> 00:36:41,590
It was me that I proposed the idea of mental, emotional and physical. The 3 levels.

215
00:36:43,976 --> 00:36:55,665
I did this in order to separate and to define the depth of the problem.

216
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:15,839
This is in hierarchy, the mental, my mental level is clear, my emotional level is not clear,

217
00:37:17,711 --> 00:37:27,564
I have some grief, I have some pains and I have my physical body.

218
00:37:36,801 --> 00:37:52,800
I have noticed that if drugs were given for a person in depression, on emotional level,

219
00:37:55,981 --> 00:38:05,340
he was having a clear mental level, he says "Now, I feel my mind is not clear anymore".

220
00:38:09,906 --> 00:38:18,331
I realize that problems from emotional level they can go deeper into the mental level.

221
00:38:27,425 --> 00:38:40,328
Also I noticed another way. When a mental problem was there, quite deep and

222
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:50,027
it was treated correctly the problem would go through the emotional. How?

223
00:38:54,701 --> 00:39:03,194
By the person complaining after that "I have become irritable, I have become more

224
00:39:04,745 --> 00:39:13,159
dissatisfied" and then you keep on treating him and then the whole problem goes to

225
00:39:15,516 --> 00:39:20,490
the physical body and there is a problem with his stomach.

226
00:39:22,844 --> 00:39:30,887
On the opposite, there is, as I have said in the Science of Homeopathy,

227
00:39:36,686 --> 00:39:47,277
each level has different organs. That means mental level has functions,

228
00:39:50,348 --> 00:39:56,566
it's like physical organs in a hierarchical importance.

229
00:39:59,053 --> 00:40:09,943
Which is the most deep organ which keeps a person intact, the person feels

230
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:19,374
"I am George and I am not lost, I don't know who I am".

231
00:40:22,454 --> 00:40:36,108
If I lost this, if I don't feel anymore my existence, my awareness, I don't have

232
00:40:37,901 --> 00:40:47,264
my consciousness fully, then I go to the doctor and he gives me a remedy.

233
00:40:51,730 --> 00:41:08,122
This focus of the high disturbance on the mental level goes lower into memory.

234
00:41:10,348 --> 00:41:14,975
I lose my memory I forget more easily than before certain things.

235
00:41:20,563 --> 00:41:29,851
In the same way with the emotional level. I am very depressed. Take a remedy.

236
00:41:33,364 --> 00:41:44,750
After a month I'm very irritable. So the irritation is on a lower level than

237
00:41:46,311 --> 00:41:56,648
the depression. Suicidal depression is the deepest. The person wants to kill himself.

238
00:41:57,888 --> 00:42:03,813
It's the deepest on the emotional level from suicidal depression goes to depression.

239
00:42:05,429 --> 00:42:12,305
The persons says "I don't think of committing suicide anymore. It was in my mind

240
00:42:13,066 --> 00:42:20,459
all the time, not anymore, much less". He is doing well.

241
00:42:22,096 --> 00:42:26,461
Otherwise how would you know what the remedy has done if you don't know

242
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:29,511
these things?

243
00:42:39,478 --> 00:42:45,591
You have to read the Science of Homeopathy, if the chapter is not conceivable.

244
00:43:08,005 --> 00:43:12,147
"[...]demands and points to the remedy suited to relieve it - and moreover,

245
00:43:13,792 --> 00:43:29,912
the totality of these symptoms, of this outwardly reflected picture of the internal

246
00:43:31,053 --> 00:43:40,252
essence of the disease, that is, of the affection of the vital force, must be the principal

247
00:43:41,449 --> 00:43:48,359
or the sole means, whereby the disease can make known what remedy it requires".

248
00:43:51,422 --> 00:44:00,484
"[...] The totality of these symptoms" which are reflected in the organism,

249
00:44:05,488 --> 00:44:16,529
" [...]of the internal essence of the disease", which is the disturbance of the vital force

250
00:44:17,949 --> 00:44:23,468
"[...]must be the principal, or the sole means, whereby the disease can make known

251
00:44:24,299 --> 00:44:33,487
what remedy it requires". Actually what he says is what we always say that

252
00:44:34,223 --> 00:44:42,077
in order to find your disease, it is not enough to tell me that you have a pneumonia,

253
00:44:44,761 --> 00:44:51,248
it's not enough to tell me a conventional medicine diagnosis.

254
00:44:52,736 --> 00:45:00,912
We cannot give you a remedy. This is something that was ignored for many years.

255
00:45:02,222 --> 00:45:09,176
When I first came to Homeopathy, I came in Homeopathy by meeting somebody

256
00:45:12,689 --> 00:45:19,524
who was giving mixtures of remedies for a specific problem.

257
00:45:25,216 --> 00:45:28,715
You have headaches, he has a headache bottle, he gives you the bottle for headache.

258
00:45:29,674 --> 00:45:34,978
What contained the bottle of remedies? Different remedies for headaches. All of them.

259
00:45:36,147 --> 00:45:44,018
20 - 30 remedies inside. I have hay fever, I had also hay fever, I came for that,

260
00:45:45,281 --> 00:46:01,343
he gave me a remedy I still remember "Rhinopalsan". And this remedy contained...

261
00:46:02,221 --> 00:46:10,253
I can't remember how many remedies. I took all this mixture and my nose was better

262
00:46:14,944 --> 00:46:20,761
but my energy went down. Actually it was suppressing me because it was low potency,

263
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:31,384
20 remedies every day... I suddenly felt heavy, tired...

264
00:46:37,943 --> 00:46:43,939
Then actually I had rejected Homeopathy in the way I had rejected conventional

265
00:46:45,525 --> 00:46:51,378
Medicine when I was 16. I went to the doctor and they said we can fuse your spine

266
00:46:52,854 --> 00:46:54,624
and maybe you'll be paralyzed.

267
00:46:55,338 --> 00:46:59,273
"No thank you very much, goodbye, I don't want to be paralyzed".

268
00:47:03,574 --> 00:47:11,102
Unless I had an accident with my car and I did not know what to do, I wanted to read

269
00:47:12,418 --> 00:47:16,909
a book about Homeopathy after all. They gave me this book,

270
00:47:20,849 --> 00:47:25,187
Boericke's Materia Medica. "What is this book you read there on the bedside...?"

271
00:47:27,588 --> 00:47:31,431
There was a friend of mine, he says "Boericke's Materia Medica".

272
00:47:33,013 --> 00:47:42,800
Where can I buy it? [Address] Johannesburg. I took the bus because I didn't have

273
00:47:44,417 --> 00:47:48,613
a car anymore, it was smashed totally but I was not hurt.

274
00:47:50,603 --> 00:47:56,566
And I got this book which I read right through in 2-3 days, I can't remember but I did

275
00:47:58,077 --> 00:48:02,136
not stop until I had finished all the remedies. Can you imagine this?

276
00:48:04,286 --> 00:48:11,914
I still can remember some of the very small remedies I was reading 51 years ago.

277
00:48:15,621 --> 00:48:27,714
Then I understood and I said to my friend who had introduced me to this guy

278
00:48:29,609 --> 00:48:33,043
and I said your friend who is doing this is not doing the correct Homeopathy.

279
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:40,269
He said why? After that I bought Kent and I read and next time when we met

280
00:48:41,955 --> 00:48:48,616
I explained to him why this man selling medicines for this kind of things

281
00:48:50,062 --> 00:49:03,656
was not correct. But very soon I found out, all of Europe, America... they used it

282
00:49:05,686 --> 00:49:12,548
in this way. That means they have never read what this man was writing.

283
00:49:14,697 --> 00:49:24,260
They were just medical doctors who knew the diagnosis, migraine, hay fever,

284
00:49:25,453 --> 00:49:33,248
duodenal ulcer, bronchitis and would give you the bronchitis remedies.

285
00:49:37,321 --> 00:49:46,455
But what he was saying, it was totally different. He says the totality of the symptoms

286
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:57,511
will indicate the proper remedy. "[...] the totality of the symptoms must be the

287
00:49:59,033 --> 00:50:07,700
principal, indeed the only thing that the physician has to take note of in every case

288
00:50:08,946 --> 00:50:16,382
of disease and to remove by means of his art, in order that it shall be cured

289
00:50:17,506 --> 00:50:23,164
and transformed into health". Very clear.

290
00:50:27,595 --> 00:50:38,584
Paragraph 8 says "It is not conceivable, nor can it be proved by any experience

291
00:50:40,355 --> 00:50:49,250
in the world, that after removal of all the symptoms of the disease and of the entire

292
00:50:52,212 --> 00:50:58,959
collection of the perceptible phenomena, there should or could remain anything else

293
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:02,044
besides health..."

294
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:16,970
Here Hahnemann is quite definite, quite sure that after the removal of all the

295
00:51:18,351 --> 00:51:23,718
symptoms nothing remains but health.

296
00:51:26,115 --> 00:51:33,642
That paragraph has to be understood again in the spirit of the old times of Hahnemann.

297
00:51:35,366 --> 00:51:49,520
Today it's not valid. Why? Because the phenomena today are such that you may have

298
00:51:50,665 --> 00:52:01,304
no symptoms and yet there can be some underlying problem which will be manifesting

299
00:52:03,406 --> 00:52:05,823
later on.

300
00:52:14,478 --> 00:52:28,332
For instance, in cases of high blood pressure the person may feel in very good health

301
00:52:30,739 --> 00:52:38,480
without any symptoms, yet his blood pressure can be quite high.

302
00:52:40,489 --> 00:52:46,874
Actually, when the blood pressure is quite high many people feel excellent.

303
00:52:51,226 --> 00:53:02,361
But that is dangerous. That means in our time when our constitutions have been

304
00:53:03,988 --> 00:53:23,591
undermined by all kinds of pollutions etc., we may have an underlying condition

305
00:53:24,424 --> 00:53:33,260
which may be preparing the organism for a severe problem.

306
00:53:36,359 --> 00:53:47,351
Therefore this paragraph should be read in two ways. One way is that

307
00:53:49,336 --> 00:53:55,098
when a person comes and is a good constitution and has a totality of symptoms

308
00:53:56,439 --> 00:54:02,744
and you find a remedy that the symptoms are gone, really remains in good health.

309
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:05,961
This is one way that should be read.

310
00:54:07,456 --> 00:54:26,471
The other way is that if a person has a weak constitution which has the possibility

311
00:54:27,496 --> 00:54:39,335
potentially to develop a severe disease may not be apparent because there were

312
00:54:40,571 --> 00:54:42,840
no symptoms to indicate it.

313
00:54:45,447 --> 00:54:58,052
In another way, you may be giving a remedy and you have the alleviation of certain

314
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:12,309
symptoms but underneath there may be a quiet pathology which can be developing.

315
00:55:14,098 --> 00:55:24,004
We know it today that this can be so. And this quiet pathology will manifest the

316
00:55:25,338 --> 00:55:34,624
moment that there is a stress from the environment or from his own self.

317
00:55:41,394 --> 00:55:50,225
That means there is somebody who says "I am well now", you don't need to continue

318
00:55:51,691 --> 00:56:04,449
treatment but at a certain time and under stress suddenly breaks out in a quite serious

319
00:56:04,998 --> 00:56:06,171
condition.

320
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:26,650
So this idea of Hahnemann, the way he says it..."It is not conceivable, nor can it be

321
00:56:28,791 --> 00:56:40,465
proved by any experience in the world", this is quite a strong statement

322
00:56:41,694 --> 00:56:47,822
"[...]that after removal of all the symptoms of the disease [...]  there should or could

323
00:56:49,354 --> 00:56:57,487
remain anything else but health". So it could under certain condition

324
00:56:58,796 --> 00:57:03,317
depending on the level of health an individual is in.

325
00:57:04,893 --> 00:57:09,815
Don't be surprised if you have treated somebody and has done very well

326
00:57:11,881 --> 00:57:25,836
and after 3,4,5 years under a stress either because of antibiotics, chemical drugs,

327
00:57:28,833 --> 00:57:39,161
emotional stress or whatever other reason a predisposition which is engrafted

328
00:57:40,679 --> 00:57:50,679
in his genes may just flare up suddenly, you may see a quite serious condition

329
00:57:52,087 --> 00:58:01,530
developing. The matter of predisposition, we will discuss later on also.

330
00:58:08,844 --> 00:58:19,535
"In the healthy condition of men, the spiritual vital force (autocracy), the dynamis

331
00:58:21,033 --> 00:58:26,817
that animates the material body (organism), rules with unbounded sway..."

332
00:58:28,410 --> 00:58:48,942
This paragraph has been misunderstood by a lot of people in the clergy.

333
00:58:50,237 --> 00:58:52,559
Because it says "the spiritual vital force".

334
00:58:55,667 --> 00:59:02,755
The meaning "spiritual" here I don't know the exact German word. It's the same.

335
00:59:05,201 --> 00:59:20,571
Means something else as well? Spiritual, Stephan...Similar to spirit.

336
00:59:29,665 --> 00:59:34,484
We have to take into consideration that Hahnemann was living in 1800

337
00:59:40,727 --> 00:59:50,937
and he has to describe the energy, the biological energy of the body and has to find

338
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:54,136
a word to describe it.

339
00:59:55,756 --> 01:00:01,756
And "spirit" during this time means something which is beyond material.

340
01:00:04,952 --> 01:00:21,712
It is not something material, something immaterial, which today we know that it is

341
01:00:22,809 --> 01:00:36,145
the bioenergy of the body. We know that the heart works with electric energy.

342
01:00:39,830 --> 01:00:46,696
We move our hands, we speak with the energy which is produced in our body.

343
01:00:48,306 --> 01:00:55,127
So therefore what he means is this energy which everyone has and everyone

344
01:00:58,977 --> 01:01:04,536
understands about that energy. What is simpler than this?

345
01:01:07,178 --> 01:01:14,433
How you move your hands? By some energy. This energy is meant here. That's all.

346
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:22,312
It's not something spiritual or something magical or anything like that.

347
01:01:24,853 --> 01:01:29,291
Hahnemann here means only the energy of the body. We can say that we have

348
01:01:30,095 --> 01:01:41,726
an energy body which is behind all the cells of our body, every cell of our body contains

349
01:01:43,041 --> 01:01:50,664
this kind of energy. It's behind every cell, every tissue, every organ, every system

350
01:01:51,676 --> 01:01:59,579
of our body, there is this energy. Therefore there is not misunderstanding.

351
01:02:07,726 --> 01:02:16,575
"[...]   rules with unbounded sway". This kind of energy, he says, rules the organism

352
01:02:21,775 --> 01:02:29,116
without any interference. Unbounded. Without any boundaries.

353
01:02:35,439 --> 01:02:44,407
"[...]and retains all the parts of the organism in admirable, harmonious, vital operation,

354
01:02:46,391 --> 01:02:51,611
as regards both sensations and functions".

355
01:02:52,775 --> 01:03:03,389
It is this energy which controls our emotions and our actions, functions. "[...]  so that

356
01:03:04,808 --> 01:03:15,242
our indwelling, reason-gifted mind can freely employ this living, healthy instrument

357
01:03:16,725 --> 01:03:21,568
for the higher purposes of our existence".

358
01:03:24,162 --> 01:03:32,009
What he says in a healthy body, most probably you will have a healthy mind.

359
01:03:34,478 --> 01:03:43,584
Very simple. The ancient Greeks they used to say exactly the same thing.

360
01:03:46,711 --> 01:03:53,818
So a healthy energy body will maintain a healthy mind and a healthy body.

361
01:04:01,193 --> 01:04:10,220
And if that is so, that means, if you are healthy in your body and mind

362
01:04:14,053 --> 01:04:22,279
then only perhaps, I say only, you can use this instrument for the higher

363
01:04:23,592 --> 01:04:30,487
purposes of life. Which are the higher purposes of life?

364
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:36,054
Each one has different higher purposes of life. But which is the highest?

365
01:04:42,101 --> 01:04:55,061
To make money! This is the highest! In dollar they say "In God we trust".

366
01:04:57,893 --> 01:05:10,184
In dollar we trust. The highest purpose in life. There are people who believe.

367
01:05:11,548 --> 01:05:18,529
What nonsense are you talking about... Reality is that money speaks.

368
01:05:26,508 --> 01:05:28,699
You have money, you can do anything. You want a University? Ok.

369
01:05:29,870 --> 01:05:36,614
You have enough money? Buy the university! For the higher purposes of life.

370
01:05:42,394 --> 01:05:52,099
So use what was given to you in healthy condition for the higher purposes of life.

371
01:05:53,917 --> 01:06:00,819
This is the idea. If you want to use it for attaining money, you can use it.

372
01:06:02,906 --> 01:06:06,762
If you want to use it for having good time in life, you can use it.

373
01:06:10,974 --> 01:06:20,811
But Hahnemann says you better use it for the higher purposes of your life.

374
01:06:22,592 --> 01:06:39,985
Exactly he says "[...]so that our indwelling, reason-gifted mind can freely employ

375
01:06:40,996 --> 01:06:48,521
this living, healthy instrument for the higher purposes of our existence".

376
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:57,014
You see why you suffer. Because there is no purpose. Take somebody who is rich,

377
01:06:58,117 --> 01:07:04,921
who has everything... no purpose in life.

378
01:07:07,292 --> 01:07:12,952
This person will be a raged individual, going from doctor to doctor, trying to find

379
01:07:18,062 --> 01:07:21,043
something to stimulate...Why?

380
01:07:22,812 --> 01:07:31,517
Because there is no purpose or the purpose was turned to the wrong direction.

381
01:07:33,052 --> 01:07:37,097
Not higher, but lower purposes of life.

382
01:07:39,103 --> 01:07:48,972
Once your purpose is turned downwards, you can forget about being healthy

383
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:59,417
and why are we not really healthy? Because we have this element,

384
01:08:01,168 --> 01:08:07,931
this dark, negative element, it's ingrained in our nature. It's within ourselves.

385
01:08:09,797 --> 01:08:17,303
We cannot get rid entirely of the negative part of ourselves.

386
01:08:19,238 --> 01:08:25,812
Always we will have something that's dragging you down.

387
01:08:33,445 --> 01:08:40,432
That's why if you read the life of people who have devoted themselves

388
01:08:42,298 --> 01:08:52,766
to spiritual practices, the struggle against their own self is so great and so powerful,

389
01:08:56,411 --> 01:09:01,141
somebody pulling them down and them pulling by sheer will, pulling themselves up

390
01:09:03,297 --> 01:09:10,622
in order to come in contact with the higher purpose...

391
01:09:11,938 --> 01:09:17,670
which for them, for the monks, for the spiritual people is the realization of the

392
01:09:18,566 --> 01:09:31,073
unification with God. Feel that feeling. Full feeling that you are really united with God.

393
01:09:33,838 --> 01:09:39,423
Can you feel that if you are pulled down with your desires, little things...?

394
01:09:53,018 --> 01:09:54,274
Yes, you want to say something.

395
01:09:56,768 --> 01:10:05,659
- I want to say something concerning the spirit-like. It's a wrong translation because

396
01:10:07,419 --> 01:10:11,302
in Germany we have the same word for spirit and ghost.

397
01:10:12,978 --> 01:10:16,925
And I think in this paragraph, this is meant as ghost-like because we cannot see the

398
01:10:18,335 --> 01:10:29,595
vital force. It's ghost-like. It's similar to a ghost. And not spirit-like...

399
01:10:40,369 --> 01:10:43,055
This is mistaken in translation.

400
01:10:44,779 --> 01:10:50,323
- Some other Germans do not agree. Stephan?

401
01:10:56,286 --> 01:11:04,985
- It's the same for ghost and the spirit but I think it's the spirit in the spiritual way.

402
01:11:07,349 --> 01:11:13,954
- Anyhow I translate this so therefore there is no question about that! [LAUGHTER]

403
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:29,657
I enter the idea of Hahnemann, I understand he tried to explain something he could

404
01:11:31,633 --> 01:11:39,945
feel but not touch. How can I say this force, this energy, how can this be described?

405
01:11:43,251 --> 01:11:46,530
Spirit-like, vital force.

406
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:57,906
-[not audible]

407
01:12:07,050 --> 01:12:16,436
- We use the idea of soul, who has touched soul and put it under microscope? Nobody.

408
01:12:20,089 --> 01:12:35,432
But everybody has accepted it that soul is psyche, we have psychotherapists.

409
01:12:40,231 --> 01:12:42,716
That means therapists who are dealing exclusively with the soul.

410
01:12:42,916 --> 01:12:55,469
And they don't say "Who can tell us what the soul is? Has anybody seen the soul?"

411
01:12:56,645 --> 01:13:00,823
They don't say anymore. They used to say it for the psychotherapists also.

412
01:13:05,536 --> 01:13:10,300
But now the accept it. Soul-therapists, psychotherapists.

413
01:13:13,258 --> 01:13:18,027
- Can you please go a little bit back to paragraph 8? You said if somebody has a weak

414
01:13:19,542 --> 01:13:24,983
constitution then there is a risk that his predisposition will come up, as a big shock.

415
01:13:26,691 --> 01:13:31,450
But surely with right homeopathic treatment can we keep this predisposition at bay,

416
01:13:33,288 --> 01:13:38,824
can't we help it stay in the background and not rise despite the shock?

417
01:13:40,321 --> 01:13:41,315
- In paragraph 8 you are talking?

418
01:13:42,799 --> 01:13:48,549
- Yes because you said if people are healthy, then the symptom will disappear

419
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:55,545
with the right treatment. If they are weak, we cannot bring them back to health.

420
01:14:00,415 --> 01:14:07,442
- Normally if they have a weak constitution, the symptomatology will go,"I'm good.

421
01:14:10,164 --> 01:14:16,479
You can forget about treating yourself anymore". You release the patient you say

422
01:14:17,641 --> 01:14:23,717
"Now you feel good in all respect. Continue". But in a weak constitution there is

423
01:14:25,188 --> 01:14:32,252
the possibility that under a stress a flare up of a serious condition may arise.

424
01:14:32,452 --> 01:14:44,221
That is why we cannot say, we cannot be so absolute with the expression once

425
01:14:45,970 --> 01:14:50,884
the symptoms are gone, there is nobody in the world that can tell you that any kind

426
01:14:52,319 --> 01:14:54,479
of disease exists anymore in your body.

427
01:14:58,333 --> 01:15:07,150
- Correct but if somebody has a psychotic predisposition in the family, can you not say

428
01:15:08,316 --> 01:15:14,377
with the right treatment you could avoid that they die at 45 of a heart attack?

429
01:15:16,136 --> 01:15:21,093
If they have not developed yet the symptomatology but you think there's a risk

430
01:15:22,493 --> 01:15:27,130
but with the right treatment, they may die in 75 or 80 of something else.

431
01:15:29,147 --> 01:15:33,429
Or maybe weak heat but not young. We keep it at bay, that predisposition with the right

432
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:36,829
with the right treatment, so they are healthy.

433
01:15:39,164 --> 01:15:45,012
- Whether you can eliminate a predisposition that can kill somebody at 45? Yes.

434
01:15:47,899 --> 01:15:53,608
We can do, as long as, there are some symptoms to guide us.

435
01:15:55,221 --> 01:16:01,058
This person comes to us. He is going to die with a heart attack at 48.

436
01:16:02,590 --> 01:16:08,054
He comes to us at the age of 40. And we start treating him.

437
01:16:09,641 --> 01:16:13,864
Then most probably, he'll avoid having heart attack at 48.

438
01:16:17,590 --> 01:16:22,531
But let us say he does not come to us and he feels quite good.

439
01:16:24,438 --> 01:16:31,562
And suddenly in 48 he gets an attack and dies. That is the question now.

440
01:16:34,306 --> 01:16:39,403
This somebody who did not have symptoms, was he absolutely healthy?

441
01:16:42,761 --> 01:16:49,224
And the answer is no. He was not absolutely healthy in the way Hahnemann stresses

442
01:16:50,749 --> 01:16:58,329
it so strongly. That if there are no symptoms there is not any possibility,

443
01:16:59,987 --> 01:17:07,788
anybody in the world can say that this person is not healthy. That is clear.

444
01:17:09,315 --> 01:17:12,508
This is what we can say about paragraph 8.
