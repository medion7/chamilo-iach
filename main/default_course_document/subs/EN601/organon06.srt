1
00:00:23,062 --> 00:00:37,461
The last paragraph "[...] But purgatives for
itch, and issues for epilepsy, cannot be

2
00:00:37,461 --> 00:00:45,417
more heterogeneous, more dissimilar
deranging agents - cannot be more

3
00:00:45,717 --> 00:00:53,815
allopathic, more exhausting modes of
treatment - than are the customary

4
00:00:54,117 --> 00:01:02,414
prescriptions, composed of unknown
ingredients, used in ordinary practice for

5
00:01:02,713 --> 00:01:08,415
the other nameless, innumerable
forms of disease..."

6
00:01:12,015 --> 00:01:19,816
He criticizes the kind of treatment
of his time and he says "purgatives",

7
00:01:27,017 --> 00:01:45,916
remedies that cause diarrheas were
used for psora and also epilepsy.

8
00:01:46,516 --> 00:02:02,116
They used to cure epilepsy by giving
purgatives, exhausting the organism

9
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:12,490
through constant diarrheas and in psora
if you are exhausted the psora will be

10
00:02:13,086 --> 00:02:20,586
suppressed and as soon as you start
eating again the psora will manifest.

11
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:27,786
The same with epilepsy. They used to
exhaust the people make them crazy...

12
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:49,090
"[...] These likewise do nothing..." This
kind of treatments who do not belong to

13
00:02:49,689 --> 00:03:02,590
either Homeopathy or Allopathy, which are
irrelevant, why cause diarrhea for psora?

14
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:16,991
"These do nothing but debilitate, and
only suppress or suspend the malady for

15
00:03:17,286 --> 00:03:25,989
a short time without being able to cure it,
and when used for a long time always add

16
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:32,289
a new morbid state
to the old disease".

17
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:39,786
And if they are used for long time you
will get a new, more severe disease.

18
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:56,888
This leads us to paragraph 40 "Or the
new disease, after having long acted

19
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:06,490
on the organism, at length joins the old one
that is dissimilar to it, and forms with it

20
00:04:07,087 --> 00:04:09,787
a complex disease..."

21
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:25,390
So the new disease after a long time
complicates with the previous one and the two

22
00:04:25,687 --> 00:04:30,789
together, they form a
new nosological entity.

23
00:04:37,387 --> 00:04:55,086
We see this everyday today, we see what
happens when conventional medicine starts

24
00:04:55,387 --> 00:05:10,686
treating chronic conditions and in the
process there are side effects which means

25
00:05:11,286 --> 00:05:21,186
new problems arising and while you
are treating a chronic condition

26
00:05:21,645 --> 00:05:33,647
of the kidneys after some period, the
heart gets involved and the two together

27
00:05:33,946 --> 00:05:45,745
they form a kind of a new pathology which
has both heart and kidney problems.

28
00:05:47,546 --> 00:05:58,642
I transferred the idea of diseases, as
he says, to the idea of diseases treated

29
00:05:59,246 --> 00:06:03,445
with conventional medicine.

30
00:06:05,847 --> 00:06:19,045
Because this is more important for
us what he brings as an example...

31
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:29,846
It's a rare situation where two dissimilar
diseases meet in the same place but

32
00:06:30,746 --> 00:06:38,546
actually his observation is true
concerning what is done today by

33
00:06:39,147 --> 00:06:43,642
conventional medicine.

34
00:06:44,245 --> 00:06:51,146
This we may not see, very rarely, we
will see that a new disease suppresses

35
00:06:51,446 --> 00:07:00,746
an old one. But we see very frequently
that a disease is transformed into

36
00:07:01,047 --> 00:07:05,246
some other complications
and side effects,

37
00:07:05,846 --> 00:07:10,643
if treated constantly
with allopathic drugs.

38
00:07:13,645 --> 00:07:20,845
"[...] Thus a syphilitic patient may
become psoric, and vice versa.

39
00:07:21,446 --> 00:07:26,842
As two diseases dissimilar to each other,
they cannot remove, cannot cure one

40
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:40,346
another..." This is the idea that has
started to bring up the idea of miasms.

41
00:07:41,842 --> 00:07:58,944
And he will conclude in the end that in
an organism you may have a psoric patient

42
00:08:00,745 --> 00:08:08,244
who in the process he gets syphilis,
who in the process of his life,

43
00:08:08,542 --> 00:08:11,546
he also gets gonorrhea.

44
00:08:13,046 --> 00:08:22,642
And he says out of these 3 miasms
whatever is the most powerful influence

45
00:08:22,944 --> 00:08:28,046
upon the body is and
will manifest first.

46
00:08:31,643 --> 00:08:42,445
If you treat this uppermost miasmatic
disease, then the next one will come up

47
00:08:43,042 --> 00:08:45,443
and manifest itself.

48
00:08:53,446 --> 00:09:01,991
"[...]As two diseases dissimilar to each
other, they cannot remove, cannot cure one

49
00:09:05,292 --> 00:09:20,694
another. At first the venereal symptoms
are kept in abeyance and suspended

50
00:09:21,293 --> 00:09:26,991
when the psoric eruption begins to
appear; in course of time, however

51
00:09:27,695 --> 00:09:36,996
(as the syphilis is at least as strong as the
psora), the two join together,1 that is,

52
00:09:37,296 --> 00:09:45,096
each involves those parts of the organism
only which are most adapted for it,

53
00:09:46,297 --> 00:09:52,894
and the patient is thereby rendered more
diseased and more difficult to cure."

54
00:09:54,093 --> 00:10:04,397
His idea is that each of the 3 miasms
occupies a different place in the organism.

55
00:10:07,697 --> 00:10:10,994
You treat always according
to the symptoms.

56
00:10:11,296 --> 00:10:19,097
Which is the most prominent and the
most powerful will come up first.

57
00:10:20,597 --> 00:10:25,394
An organism has a
predisposition for sycosis.

58
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:31,996
The sycotic Medorrhinum will be first.
The sycotic miasm will be uppermost

59
00:10:32,594 --> 00:10:37,696
because father/ mother had
sycosis, it comes first.

60
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:49,396
And then after you treat with sycotic
remedies and this layer goes away

61
00:10:49,696 --> 00:10:57,793
then it starts Mercury coming up and
you suspect there was some syphilis

62
00:10:58,097 --> 00:11:00,795
in the family as well.

63
00:11:10,997 --> 00:11:16,697
"[...] When two dissimilar acute infectious
diseases meet, as for example,

64
00:11:16,996 --> 00:11:21,796
smallpox and measles, the one
usually suspends the other."

65
00:11:22,397 --> 00:11:32,295
These observations we don't see today.
"[...]as it has been before observed;

66
00:11:33,195 --> 00:11:41,596
yet there have also been severe epidemics
of this kind, where, in rare cases,

67
00:11:42,195 --> 00:11:48,793
two dissimilar acute diseases occurred
simultaneously in one and the same body,

68
00:11:49,693 --> 00:11:54,796
and for a short time combined,
as it were, with each other..."

69
00:11:57,193 --> 00:12:08,594
Sometimes you have two different
epidemics combined forming a new entity.

70
00:12:12,793 --> 00:12:22,696
I do not have the experience.
It's interesting to know.

71
00:12:25,093 --> 00:12:29,896
"[...]During an epidemic, in which
smallpox and measles were prevalent

72
00:12:30,196 --> 00:12:37,697
at the same time, among three hundred
cases (in which these diseases avoided

73
00:12:37,993 --> 00:12:45,196
or suspended one another, and measles
attacked patients twenty days after

74
00:12:45,497 --> 00:12:53,294
the smallpox broke out, the smallpox,
however, from seventeen to eighteen days

75
00:12:53,894 --> 00:12:59,594
after the appearance of the measles, so
that the first disease had previously

76
00:12:59,895 --> 00:13:02,893
completed its regular course)"

77
00:13:04,695 --> 00:13:12,793
Two epidemics, one comes runs its
course and then the other one can come.

78
00:13:13,096 --> 00:13:20,896
Sometimes both are occupying
place in the organism.

79
00:13:26,893 --> 00:13:33,197
"[...]Rainey witnessed the simultaneous
occurrence of smallpox and measles

80
00:13:33,794 --> 00:13:46,996
in two girls. J. Maurice, in his whole
practice, only observed two such cases.

81
00:13:47,596 --> 00:13:55,397
Similar cases are to be found in
Ettmuller's works, and in the writings

82
00:13:55,696 --> 00:13:57,493
of a few others.

83
00:14:01,696 --> 00:14:08,297
Zencker saw cow-pox run its regular
course along with measles and along

84
00:14:08,418 --> 00:14:17,114
with purpura." These ideas are
observations of doctors of old cases,

85
00:14:17,713 --> 00:14:21,848
today we don't see such cases.

86
00:14:22,752 --> 00:14:31,450
Paragraph 41. "Much more frequent than
the natural diseases associating with

87
00:14:32,348 --> 00:14:41,438
and complicating one another in the
same body, are the morbid complication

88
00:14:42,038 --> 00:14:45,337
resulting from the art of the ordinary
practitioner, which the inappropriate

89
00:14:45,941 --> 00:14:51,337
medical treatment (the allopathic method)
is apt to produce by the long-continued

90
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,637
employment of unsuitable drugs."

91
00:15:04,539 --> 00:15:10,841
50 years ago I've read this and
I'm reading it again today.

92
00:15:14,738 --> 00:15:23,437
He says actually what I am saying. More
frequent than the diseases suppressing

93
00:15:23,738 --> 00:15:33,338
each other, what suppresses the
diseases is the inappropriate treatment

94
00:15:33,939 --> 00:15:35,437
which is employed.

95
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:45,339
And if their treatment was inappropriate
suppressing diseases you can understand

96
00:15:45,638 --> 00:15:51,941
today how much more
powerful drugs we have.

97
00:15:53,438 --> 00:16:05,742
Because by these times they had herbs and
leeches, simple things could not really

98
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:12,338
suppress as quick as we do today
with conventional medicine.

99
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:23,442
It's very interesting that he says that
because most probably what was happening

100
00:16:23,741 --> 00:16:34,241
during this time, the type of treatment
it was so aggressive in severe cases that

101
00:16:34,841 --> 00:16:45,340
the patient actually died so they had
much more deaths during that time.

102
00:16:47,739 --> 00:16:58,838
Today people do not die, they
just remain deeply diseased

103
00:17:00,941 --> 00:17:06,937
and deeper in any case
than before the treatment.

104
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:19,840
Today they can survive. We found ways to
suppress and let the organism stay alive.

105
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:30,638
And if it happens that somebody wants
to die, they do not allow him to die.

106
00:17:33,939 --> 00:17:41,739
You say the heart is collapsing, Ok put
another heart, the liver is collapsing,

107
00:17:42,642 --> 00:17:50,440
Ok put out the liver, put another liver,
the lungs are not functioning anymore,

108
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:58,237
put him in a machine
and make him breathe.

109
00:18:00,637 --> 00:18:11,438
This is considered the topmost scientific
application of medicine today.

110
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:21,337
"[...]To the natural disease, which it is
proposed to cure, there are then added,

111
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:29,737
by the constant repetition of the
unsuitable medicinal agent, the new,

112
00:18:30,341 --> 00:18:39,637
often very tedious, morbid conditions
corresponding to the nature of this agent..."

113
00:18:41,138 --> 00:18:47,739
Due to the repetition of the medication,
you will have a new disease

114
00:18:48,342 --> 00:18:55,842
which is of the nature of the
medicine you have been using.

115
00:18:57,638 --> 00:19:06,940
So you have been using hormonal
treatment, the problem will appear mostly

116
00:19:07,837 --> 00:19:12,638
on your hormonal area.

117
00:19:15,941 --> 00:19:31,841
You are using medication of the urinary
tract the problem most probably

118
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:42,339
from a simple cystitis that starts,
will end up into kidney failure.

119
00:19:50,441 --> 00:19:54,339
This was what he was saying.

120
00:19:59,137 --> 00:20:05,741
"[...]adding to the old disease a new, dissimilar,
artificial malady of a chronic nature,

121
00:20:06,042 --> 00:20:13,240
and thus give the patient a double
in place of a single disease,

122
00:20:14,141 --> 00:20:18,938
that is to say, render him much
worse and more difficult to cure,

123
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:23,139
often quite incurable..."

124
00:20:24,441 --> 00:20:31,640
When we take the cases sometimes we see
they have taken a lot of medications

125
00:20:32,841 --> 00:20:42,141
we declare this case incurable. Not
possible to cure, unfortunately.

126
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:54,741
It's amazing that this man at this time he
could have noticed, observed and written

127
00:20:55,339 --> 00:21:02,241
down such details of what was going to
happen all along the medical history

128
00:21:03,141 --> 00:21:10,038
in 200 years since
he wrote this book.

129
00:21:13,337 --> 00:21:19,941
"[...] Many of the cases for which advice
is asked in medical journals, as also

130
00:21:20,241 --> 00:21:27,741
the records of other cases in medical
writings, attest the truth of this..."

131
00:21:28,638 --> 00:21:35,241
He says, I read the cases in the medical
journals of the time and I came to

132
00:21:35,838 --> 00:21:44,237
this conclusion. "[...]Of a similar
character are the frequent cases in which

133
00:21:45,441 --> 00:22:00,137
the venereal chancrous disease..."

134
00:22:08,841 --> 00:22:17,841
This parlance is a little bit
out of our comprehension.

135
00:22:19,941 --> 00:22:33,141
Venereal chancre. I have never seen
this but if sycosis remained untreated...

136
00:22:40,338 --> 00:22:46,040
Of a similar character are the frequent cases
in which the venereal chancrous disease

137
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:52,637
[...] complicated especially with psora or
with dyscrasia of condylomatous gonorrhea..."

138
00:22:59,237 --> 00:23:20,838
This is less frequent when syphilis is
untreated there is a chancre. Ulcer.

139
00:23:22,937 --> 00:23:32,839
There is an ulcer in the beginning but if
it is left untreated, this goes away and

140
00:23:33,441 --> 00:23:44,242
the syphilis enters the system going
into the secondary syphilis and then

141
00:23:45,141 --> 00:23:50,840
tertiary syphilis which the
nervous system is paralyzed.

142
00:23:51,440 --> 00:24:05,543
But with sycosis, gonorrhea, the second
stage of condylomata is the one that

143
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:14,239
will stay for many years and they
will appear there and stay there.

144
00:24:17,241 --> 00:24:28,638
Today sometimes we ask whether a person
got gonorrhea in his young life.

145
00:24:29,539 --> 00:24:36,141
He says no. But actually if you
want to know if he got it or not

146
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:40,039
you have to ask about
condylomata as well. Why?

147
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:45,740
Because the secondary stage of
gonorrhea are the condylomata.

148
00:24:46,339 --> 00:24:53,537
These condylomata are infectious, can
be infecting the partner with whom

149
00:24:54,141 --> 00:25:04,040
you have sex. Therefore you are supposed
to have the gonorrheal, the sycotic miasm.

150
00:25:30,439 --> 00:25:38,241
"[...] And all this complication he says "[...]is
not cured by long-continued or frequently

151
00:25:38,841 --> 00:25:48,739
repeated treatment with large doses
of unsuitable mercurial preparations,

152
00:25:49,639 --> 00:25:57,139
but assumes its place in the organism
beside the chronic mercurial affection

153
00:25:57,741 --> 00:26:05,838
that has been in the meantime gradually
developed, and thus along with it often forms

154
00:26:07,637 --> 00:26:16,941
a hideous monster of complicated disease
(under the general name of masked venereal

155
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:24,142
disease), which then, when not quite
incurable, can only be transformed into health

156
00:26:24,738 --> 00:26:27,741
with the greatest difficulty."

157
00:26:29,539 --> 00:26:37,940
Even in his time, once you had a
person having syphilis and gonorrhea

158
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,341
then you have a difficult case.

159
00:26:48,441 --> 00:27:04,341
Now the perfect example of the suppression
of this venereal diseases today

160
00:27:09,442 --> 00:27:13,042
is the AIDS cases.

161
00:27:15,739 --> 00:27:27,442
In the AIDS cases what has happened?
It is syphilis and gonorrhea treated

162
00:27:28,941 --> 00:27:39,738
repeatedly by antibiotics. So you
have the miasms plus antibiotics that

163
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:49,038
have suppressed these two miasms, with
the end result being an immune system

164
00:27:50,241 --> 00:27:53,238
that is totally compromised.

165
00:27:53,840 --> 00:28:10,637
I was so amazed to hear the definition of
AIDS, a totally compromised immune system.

166
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:24,740
Is this the definition of a disease? It's
the result of the treatment of syphilis and

167
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:28,339
gonorrhea through antibiotics.

168
00:28:31,637 --> 00:28:39,439
And it was very interesting that in 1970,
when I was lecturing a group of doctors

169
00:28:39,737 --> 00:28:50,839
in Athens I have said that some years
later, if they continue giving antibiotics

170
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:59,241
to such diseases they will create new
diseases that will be incurable.

171
00:29:03,741 --> 00:29:12,442
And it was logical to say this because by
this time in Greece everyone was using

172
00:29:12,742 --> 00:29:25,041
lots of antibiotics. You have gonorrhea, it's
nothing, common cold just take 3, 5 days

173
00:29:25,341 --> 00:29:30,438
of antibiotics and it's gone.
Syphilis also, penicillin.

174
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:42,737
But penicillin in the first years in order
to treat syphilis you need 500 units.

175
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:50,838
After a few years 1000 units.
After 2 more years 3000 units...

176
00:29:55,637 --> 00:30:09,738
So the organisms were resisting the
suppression and they needed more and more

177
00:30:10,941 --> 00:30:20,240
by the time of Hahnemann, Mercury
was a very powerful agent and

178
00:30:20,539 --> 00:30:26,238
anybody who gave Mercury was
suppressing all kind of diseases.

179
00:30:28,638 --> 00:30:35,842
And that's why we see today
a lot of mercurial cases.

180
00:30:37,937 --> 00:30:46,937
It's coming from ancestors who were
taking a lot of Mercury to cure this kind

181
00:30:47,239 --> 00:30:56,842
of diseases whether syphilis or gonorrhea
and then it comes today where syphilis

182
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:04,337
appears on a totally
different picture.

183
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:11,540
It's not anymore the primary or the
secondary or even the tertiary syphilis.

184
00:31:13,337 --> 00:31:19,637
Syphilis appears today mostly
in mental aberrations.

185
00:31:26,842 --> 00:31:36,741
One thing which is very characteristic of
syphilis as a symptom is when a person

186
00:31:37,637 --> 00:31:51,141
has a tremendous fear of dirt. Anything
they touch they feel it's dirty

187
00:31:51,437 --> 00:31:53,998
and they have to wash
their hands immediately.

188
00:31:54,598 --> 00:32:05,999
They can wash 100 times a day. I have
cases that when their clothes touched

189
00:32:06,298 --> 00:32:13,799
somebody in the bus and they go to
the house they take the clothes and

190
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:23,098
they put them in fire. And
they are not rich people.

191
00:32:25,499 --> 00:32:32,398
And they will throw them. It was impossible
to put again the clothes if it touched

192
00:32:32,698 --> 00:32:46,498
somebody else. This is the one. The
second characteristic of syphilis is

193
00:32:53,398 --> 00:33:00,898
- not in all cases but in many
cases- of severe alcoholism.

194
00:33:03,001 --> 00:33:12,901
Severe alcoholism from young age
indicates the possibility of syphilitic

195
00:33:13,501 --> 00:33:17,701
predisposition from the fathers...

196
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:34,500
par 42, "Nature herself permits,
as has been stated, in some cases,

197
00:33:35,401 --> 00:33:41,103
the simultaneous occurrence of two (indeed,
of three) natural disease in one and

198
00:33:41,401 --> 00:33:49,800
the same body. This complication, however,
it must be remarked, happens only

199
00:33:50,099 --> 00:33:57,702
in the case of two dissimilar diseases, which
according to the eternal laws of nature

200
00:33:58,601 --> 00:34:06,100
do not remove, do not annihilate and
cannot cure one another, but, as it seems,

201
00:34:06,698 --> 00:34:12,998
both (or all three) remain, as it were,
separate in the organism, and each takes

202
00:34:13,602 --> 00:34:20,802
possession of the parts and systems particularly
appropriate to it, which, on account

203
00:34:21,401 --> 00:34:27,101
of the want of resemblance of these maladies
to each other, can very well happen

204
00:34:27,401 --> 00:34:32,801
without disparagement
to the unity of life."

205
00:34:33,398 --> 00:34:40,900
Two dissimilar diseases cannot cure, cannot
annihilate each other and can co-occupy

206
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:51,102
a different place in the organism in
such a way as to allow life to continue.

207
00:34:54,400 --> 00:35:07,901
This is something not known to us. In my
memory I cannot bring a case of that type

208
00:35:08,499 --> 00:35:13,002
but anyhow this is
his observation.

209
00:35:14,499 --> 00:35:22,299
Aphorism 43, "Totally different, however,
is the result when two similar diseases

210
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:30,698
meet together in the organism, that is to
say, when to the disease already present

211
00:35:31,298 --> 00:35:35,198
a stronger similar one is added.

212
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:44,203
In such cases we see how a cure can be
effected by the operations of nature,

213
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:51,398
and we get a lesson as to
how man ought to cure."

214
00:35:54,699 --> 00:36:05,801
From this two similar diseases meeting
and curing each other we get the idea

215
00:36:06,398 --> 00:36:12,703
how nature heals and we should
follow the same laws of nature.

216
00:36:14,799 --> 00:36:21,700
Paragraph 44, "Two similar diseases
can neither repel one another,

217
00:36:22,602 --> 00:36:33,100
nor suspend on another, so that the old one
shall return after the new one has run

218
00:36:33,402 --> 00:36:42,702
its course; and just as little can two
similar diseases exist beside each other in

219
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:47,802
the same organism, or together
form a double complex disease."

220
00:36:48,399 --> 00:36:56,200
So two similar diseases cannot expel
each other, cannot suppress each other

221
00:36:57,101 --> 00:37:02,798
and cannot remain both
in different places.

222
00:37:05,498 --> 00:37:08,198
-What do we mean by "disease"?

223
00:37:11,799 --> 00:37:12,998
-Measles.

224
00:37:14,501 --> 00:37:20,802
-But we know that disease is the totality
of the symptoms. So is it right to say that

225
00:37:21,401 --> 00:37:27,098
we can have two diseases in one
organism, it's still one disease.

226
00:37:28,302 --> 00:37:36,703
-No, his experience is that we
have different epidemic diseases.

227
00:37:37,901 --> 00:37:42,701
We cannot say we do not
have different diseases.

228
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:53,801
In epidemic diseases, he says, there are
some who are similar in their expression.

229
00:37:54,999 --> 00:38:06,701
So if these 2 meet, they cure each other.
Which is an example I do not know...

230
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:20,200
I don't have an example now. I don't
know if he gives any example.

231
00:38:21,402 --> 00:38:28,002
Does he give any example?
After 2 paragraphs, Ok.

232
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,398
After 2 paragraphs he
will give an example...

233
00:38:39,699 --> 00:38:47,199
So 2 similar diseases do not repel one
another, do not suspend and do not occupy

234
00:38:47,501 --> 00:38:52,301
a different place, they
simply cure each other.

235
00:38:55,002 --> 00:39:02,198
45, "No! Two diseases, differing, it is true,
in kind 1 but very similar in their phenomena

236
00:39:03,701 --> 00:39:12,403
and effects and in the sufferings and
symptoms they severally produce,

237
00:39:12,701 --> 00:39:19,002
invariably annihilate one another whenever
they meet together in the organism;

238
00:39:19,901 --> 00:39:27,701
the stronger disease namely, annihilates the
weaker, and that for this simple reason,

239
00:39:28,601 --> 00:39:35,799
because the stronger morbific
power when it invades the system,

240
00:39:36,701 --> 00:39:45,699
by reason of its similarity of action involves
precisely the same part of the organism

241
00:39:45,999 --> 00:39:50,799
that were previously affected by
the weaker morbid irritation,

242
00:39:51,400 --> 00:40:01,601
which, consequently, can no longer act
on these parts, but is extinguished 2,

243
00:40:01,902 --> 00:40:09,101
or (in other words), the new similar
but stronger morbific potency controls

244
00:40:09,701 --> 00:40:16,124
the feelings of the patient and hence the
life principle on account of its peculiarity,

245
00:40:17,021 --> 00:40:31,091
can no longer feel the weaker similar which
becomes extinguished -exists no longer-

246
00:40:32,226 --> 00:40:36,726
for it was never anything material, but a
dynamic -spirit like- (conceptual) affection.

247
00:40:37,325 --> 00:40:44,126
The life principle henceforth is affected
only and this but temporarily by the new,

248
00:40:44,423 --> 00:40:48,026
similar but stronger
morbific potency."

249
00:40:49,226 --> 00:40:58,524
In other words if the 2 similar diseases
meet, they extinguish each other.

250
00:41:00,924 --> 00:41:05,725
I just remember something
from my experience.

251
00:41:07,825 --> 00:41:14,425
I had a patient and examining him
he said in the past I had malaria

252
00:41:18,025 --> 00:41:23,425
that was coming back again and again.
How it was cured?

253
00:41:23,726 --> 00:41:29,728
He said I took different medication
quinine... nothing helped.

254
00:41:30,326 --> 00:41:39,925
So how it was cured? He says one time I got
the fit of the trembling and rigor and

255
00:41:40,223 --> 00:41:43,525
fever while I was near the sea.

256
00:41:46,525 --> 00:41:57,325
So I felt an impulse to fall into the
cold water. He went there and fell into

257
00:41:57,625 --> 00:42:06,323
the cold water and when I came
out, since then, no more malaria.

258
00:42:09,925 --> 00:42:19,226
You can say whatever but
this is what he told me.

259
00:42:22,524 --> 00:42:37,226
Can you say that it was a similar... a cold
creates rigor, he goes into the cold water,

260
00:42:38,127 --> 00:42:50,124
that means that raises the
rigor, makes the rigor stronger.

261
00:42:52,224 --> 00:42:57,923
It was like natural
homeopathic remedy.

262
00:43:00,325 --> 00:43:13,824
A remedy from nature and perhaps such
similar occurrences may have happened.

263
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:28,225
Hahnemann repeats a lot of times in
order to establish in the consciousness

264
00:43:28,528 --> 00:43:35,423
of people the ideas. That's why
he repeats it again and again.

265
00:43:37,524 --> 00:43:48,926
Paragraph 46, "Many examples might be
adduced of diseases which, in the course

266
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:54,325
of nature, have been homeopathically
cured by other diseases presenting

267
00:43:54,624 --> 00:44:01,226
similar symptoms, were it not necessary,
as our object is to speak about something

268
00:44:01,826 --> 00:44:10,528
determinate and indubitable, to confine our
attention solely to those (few) diseases

269
00:44:11,723 --> 00:44:19,523
which are invariably the same, arise
from a fixed miasm, and hence merit

270
00:44:20,127 --> 00:44:27,926
a distinct name. Among these the smallpox,
so dreaded on account of the great

271
00:44:28,224 --> 00:44:34,224
number of its serious symptoms, occupies
a prominent position, and it has removed

272
00:44:34,826 --> 00:44:40,226
and cured a number of maladies
with similar symptoms.

273
00:44:42,924 --> 00:44:52,524
How frequently does smallpox produce
violent ophthalmia, sometimes

274
00:44:52,826 --> 00:45:04,226
even causing blindness! And see! By its
inoculation Dezoteux cured a chronic

275
00:45:04,523 --> 00:45:09,326
ophthalmia permanently,
and Leroy another.

276
00:45:16,528 --> 00:45:27,323
An amaurosis of two years' duration,
consequent on suppressed scald head,

277
00:45:28,224 --> 00:45:32,423
was perfectly cured by
it, according to Klein."

278
00:45:34,823 --> 00:45:55,527
I don't know what amaurosis
is... Kind of blindness.

279
00:46:16,527 --> 00:46:24,927
-No apparent damage to the eye, still
blindness, it is named amaurosis.

280
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:35,125
-"[...] An amaurosis of two years' duration,
consequent on suppressed scald head..."

281
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:42,025
I don't understand, there is
probably a skin eruption on the head

282
00:46:42,628 --> 00:46:46,826
"[...] was perfectly cured
by it, according to Klein.

283
00:46:48,627 --> 00:46:53,427
How often does smallpox
cause deafness and dyspnea!

284
00:46:55,226 --> 00:47:04,528
And both these chronic diseases it removed
on reaching its acme, as J. Fr. Closs

285
00:47:05,126 --> 00:47:12,327
observed. Swelling of the testicle, even
of a very severe character, is a frequent

286
00:47:12,926 --> 00:47:19,226
symptom of small-pox, and on this account
it was enabled, as Klein observed,

287
00:47:19,527 --> 00:47:30,628
to cure, by virtue of similarity, a large hard
swelling of the left testicle, consequently

288
00:47:31,226 --> 00:47:38,123
on a bruise. And another observer saw a
similar swelling of the testicle cured by it.

289
00:47:42,625 --> 00:47:50,723
Among the troublesome symptoms of small-pox
is a dysenteric state of the bowels;

290
00:47:51,926 --> 00:48:01,226
and it subdued, as Fr. Wendt observed,
a case of dysentery, as a similar

291
00:48:01,524 --> 00:48:03,627
morbific agent.

292
00:48:07,228 --> 00:48:19,226
Small-pox coming on after vaccination, as
well on account of its greater strength,

293
00:48:20,127 --> 00:48:32,426
as its great similarity, at once removes
entirely the cow-pox homeopathically, and

294
00:48:32,724 --> 00:48:40,826
does not permit it to come to maturity;
but, on the other hand, the cow-pox when

295
00:48:41,127 --> 00:48:48,023
near maturity does, on account of its great
similarity, homeopathically diminish

296
00:48:48,626 --> 00:48:57,027
very much the supervening small-pox
and make it much milder, as Muhry and

297
00:48:57,326 --> 00:48:59,724
many others testify."

298
00:49:02,425 --> 00:49:18,926
His examples are examples which we don't
have today and are the observations

299
00:49:19,227 --> 00:49:21,926
of different doctors
of his time.

300
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:30,927
The fact remains that what he wants
to say is the law of nature.

301
00:49:34,525 --> 00:49:47,726
That heals by similars. There is actually
a dictum in one of the spiritual books

302
00:49:49,825 --> 00:50:09,326
of Jewish Bible that says "men heal
by opposites, God heals by similar".

303
00:50:14,727 --> 00:50:18,026
I think I have written
it in one of my books.

304
00:50:25,826 --> 00:50:40,826
Nature has shown us the way to heal really
in a natural way by using similar agents.

305
00:50:57,326 --> 00:51:04,623
"[...]The cow-pox, a peculiar symptom of
which is to cause tumefaction of the arm,

306
00:51:07,023 --> 00:51:13,624
cured, after it broke out, a
swollen half-paralyzed arm..."

307
00:51:19,323 --> 00:51:28,023
It is interesting what he says here. I
remember a case, I had a gynecologist

308
00:51:29,224 --> 00:51:45,423
who had given up his profession because
of a fungal infection that had made

309
00:51:45,723 --> 00:51:54,423
his arm almost double in size
and was painful and weak

310
00:51:55,923 --> 00:52:00,424
and cured it with one
dose of Thuja 200 CH.

311
00:52:03,123 --> 00:52:12,723
It's strange. Perhaps this man who
must be now around 100 years old

312
00:52:17,223 --> 00:52:26,225
and we spoke 3 years ago. I
called him on the occasion.

313
00:52:26,527 --> 00:52:33,425
I wanted to find out if he still
used distilled water for drinking.

314
00:52:34,023 --> 00:52:38,527
He had this fixed idea that
distilled water is the best.

315
00:52:39,427 --> 00:52:42,725
So he had a machine to
produce distilled water.

316
00:52:43,325 --> 00:52:49,626
So I called him 3 years
ago, he must have been 97.

317
00:52:52,024 --> 00:52:59,527
"Hi, I'm George Vithoulkas. He said,
no I don't recognize your voice.

318
00:53:01,626 --> 00:53:08,226
No, I'm George Vithoulkas, you have
come to me when your hand was swollen.

319
00:53:09,127 --> 00:53:18,127
He says, that is true. But your voice I cannot
recall. So you are not George Vithoulkas.

320
00:53:21,425 --> 00:53:26,826
Ok, whether I am or I am not
I want to ask a question.

321
00:53:28,626 --> 00:53:33,727
I knew you were having a machine
that produced distilled water.

322
00:53:34,328 --> 00:53:38,825
Can you tell me of what
type this machine is?

323
00:53:44,225 --> 00:53:49,026
No, I will not give you... because I don't
recognize you're George Vithoulkas.

324
00:53:49,627 --> 00:53:55,025
For God's sake! You don't remember...
I brought some other facts.

325
00:53:55,927 --> 00:54:01,027
Yes that is true. But I can't
believe you are George Vithoulkas...

326
00:54:07,026 --> 00:54:09,125
He was 20 years older than me.

327
00:54:13,627 --> 00:54:26,824
It was a very interesting case because
this man went back to work and he was not

328
00:54:27,427 --> 00:54:37,323
shy to say that I was cured with
Homeopathy. He was an honest person.

329
00:54:40,625 --> 00:54:50,523
Now I see small-pox has produced this
and Thuja is the main remedy for

330
00:54:50,824 --> 00:54:52,327
curing small-pox.

331
00:55:16,924 --> 00:55:30,124
He brings examples about the measles. "[...]
The measles bear a strong resemblance

332
00:55:30,724 --> 00:55:38,527
in the character of its fever and cough to
the whooping-cough, and hence it was that

333
00:55:39,726 --> 00:55:50,527
Bosquillon noticed, in an epidemic where
both these affections prevailed, that many

334
00:55:51,123 --> 00:55:55,624
children who then took measles
remained free from whooping-cough..."

335
00:55:59,827 --> 00:56:08,523
What's interesting is that when you read
these examples you get the information

336
00:56:09,126 --> 00:56:16,627
that by that time the children epidemic
was a very frequent affair of what

337
00:56:16,924 --> 00:56:25,323
was happening. Today we have managed to
eliminate the possibility of a child

338
00:56:25,925 --> 00:56:34,326
to contract an epidemic. There is no
possibility because of the inoculations.

339
00:56:35,826 --> 00:56:46,325
We consider this to be good. Actually according
to the homeopathic Theory this is bad.

340
00:56:47,224 --> 00:56:54,424
That means the deeper chronic condition
does not allow the child to get infected

341
00:56:55,025 --> 00:56:57,424
with an epidemic anymore.

342
00:57:04,324 --> 00:57:18,425
And the last paragraph 47 that says, "Nothing
could teach the physician in a plainer

343
00:57:19,024 --> 00:57:28,325
and more convincing manner than the above
what kind of artificial morbific agent

344
00:57:28,926 --> 00:57:38,227
(medicine) he ought to choose in order to
cure in a sure, rapid and permanent manner,

345
00:57:39,427 --> 00:57:51,728
conformably with the process
that takes place in nature."

346
00:57:53,824 --> 00:58:04,025
So the epitome of all these examples is to
tell us this is the natural way of curing

347
00:58:05,224 --> 00:58:10,023
and if you want a natural
cure use Homeopathy.

348
00:58:16,923 --> 00:58:40,323
-When will we hear your interpretation of
paragraph 49, 50 to 291? Just a question.

349
00:58:47,225 --> 00:59:07,025
-Repeat...That will happen before the next
course. I do not know. I have no idea.

350
00:59:07,924 --> 00:59:19,323
It just came to my mind while in the open
course, it was last year I think, I have

351
00:59:22,624 --> 00:59:27,724
promised to write commentaries on the
Organon but I said I will never be able to

352
00:59:29,226 --> 00:59:34,326
do it, I must speak out
and do the commentaries.

353
00:59:36,724 --> 00:59:43,926
Maybe in this way I can complete the
commentaries on the Organon and

354
00:59:44,525 --> 00:59:52,323
many years ago I said the last
book I wanted to write will be

355
00:59:57,423 --> 01:00:01,624
the meaning and the
origin of diseases.

356
01:00:04,325 --> 01:00:16,426
I want to write a book explaining the
meaning and the origin of diseases

357
01:00:17,626 --> 01:00:24,826
for which I have some ideas but I don't
know if I will have enough time to do it.

358
01:00:26,625 --> 01:00:35,026
This is not something I can speak out. I
have to sit down and organize my thinking

359
01:00:35,627 --> 01:00:40,726
before I do it. With
this it's easy.

360
01:00:43,128 --> 01:00:53,029
I believe there is a reason for us being
sick and I have to explain the parameters

361
01:00:53,326 --> 01:01:04,425
and the reasons and also what is
and where it leads. Diseases.

362
01:01:05,326 --> 01:01:12,228
It's a difficult subject but maybe
if I have time I will do it.

363
01:01:26,326 --> 01:01:33,229
-You talked of the stimulation of the vital
force by the remedy and the occurrence

364
01:01:33,525 --> 01:01:40,728
of an aggravation. Why don't we see the
aggravation in Group A and in Group D?

365
01:01:42,229 --> 01:01:49,728
-There is an aggravation but it is mild.
Once the disease is not deep,

366
01:01:50,629 --> 01:01:52,429
the aggravation is mild.

367
01:01:53,330 --> 01:01:58,726
-So there is but you can't perceive it.
Because the symptoms are too high in

368
01:01:59,029 --> 01:02:02,626
group A and the symptoms
too mild in Group D or...?

369
01:02:03,229 --> 01:02:14,626
-No, the symptoms are not having
behind them substance in group A.

370
01:02:15,527 --> 01:02:22,427
Symptoms are superficial.
Not really deep.

371
01:02:23,025 --> 01:02:30,828
So therefore you may give a remedy and
the aggravation is hardly perceptible.

372
01:02:32,626 --> 01:02:37,725
But as we go lower and lower the
aggravation becomes more obvious.

373
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:47,625
In level 5 aggravation is more obvious,
level 6 more aggravation, 7 you may have

374
01:02:48,527 --> 01:02:50,326
aggravations.

375
01:03:03,827 --> 01:03:11,626
Aggravation are strong because the
pathology becomes deeper and deeper.

376
01:03:14,029 --> 01:03:19,725
In the last ones, there is no force
and there is no aggravation,

377
01:03:20,029 --> 01:03:29,029
there is only amelioration.
The organism is too weak.

378
01:03:31,728 --> 01:03:41,028
It's like pushing somebody to start running
and you push him and he goes a few steps

379
01:03:41,627 --> 01:03:53,027
away and stops. Not running. Because
the vital force is almost finished.

380
01:03:53,626 --> 01:04:03,828
So there is a lot of suffering in these
levels but no power of the defense mechanism

381
01:04:04,729 --> 01:04:07,125
to bring about a reaction.

382
01:04:08,025 --> 01:04:20,029
Sometimes after a few remedies you may,
in some cases, bring the organism into

383
01:04:20,329 --> 01:04:30,225
a state where the immune system becomes
stronger and stronger and at a certain

384
01:04:30,525 --> 01:04:33,527
moment it shows an aggravation.

385
01:04:34,429 --> 01:04:44,029
That will be very good after the aggravation.
That may be after 5 years of treatment.

386
01:04:46,726 --> 01:04:51,529
And there comes the aggravation
and it's very good, if it comes.

387
01:04:54,828 --> 01:04:59,925
-Hello, I would like to know
your opinion about the pill.

388
01:05:01,728 --> 01:05:02,930
-The woman pill?

389
01:05:03,528 --> 01:05:13,429
-Yes, because if we are treating someone
with Homeopathy, the body is going

390
01:05:13,728 --> 01:05:20,327
the natural way. Do you consider the pill
as something negative because it's like

391
01:05:20,927 --> 01:05:26,328
a hormonal treatment? What should
we advise to our patients?

392
01:05:26,929 --> 01:05:31,125
Some other natural
contraceptives?

393
01:05:31,727 --> 01:05:38,327
-This matter is not simple. I
will discuss a little bit.

394
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:50,326
There are cases in which the
woman who takes the pill says

395
01:05:51,826 --> 01:06:01,425
"I used to have PMS and now after having
the pill there are no more problems".

396
01:06:02,329 --> 01:06:11,925
In such a case, the pill contains the exact
amount of hormones which the organism

397
01:06:12,829 --> 01:06:20,925
needs as a supplement. It's
like insulin in diabetes...

398
01:06:26,027 --> 01:06:36,526
In this case the pill may be Ok.
I don't know on the long run.

399
01:06:37,129 --> 01:06:43,728
But in the case where the woman feels
good and takes the pill in order

400
01:06:44,329 --> 01:06:51,227
not to become pregnant, that is not good.
Definitely there is a disturbance.

401
01:06:53,925 --> 01:07:04,427
Whether the woman who had the PMS and
does not have it now this is a good thing

402
01:07:05,027 --> 01:07:13,128
or not, I say I do not know, I am not sure.
But it is not as bad as the other woman

403
01:07:13,728 --> 01:07:20,326
who is normal and has menses with no
problem and takes the pill in order

404
01:07:20,626 --> 01:07:29,926
to prevent becoming pregnant. That is really
bad and will have an effect eventually.

405
01:07:31,128 --> 01:07:41,327
Therefore the best thing to
do is not to stop the pill...

406
01:07:52,128 --> 01:07:56,327
What is the most
logical thing to do?

407
01:08:04,919 --> 01:08:13,021
The most logical thing that you have to
do, if you know the pill makes you sick.

408
01:08:24,119 --> 01:08:28,619
Become pregnant? No, because you
don't want to become pregnant.

409
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:41,821
You just tell your man please have
a condom. This is the most simple.

410
01:08:44,519 --> 01:08:51,421
Why a woman should destroy her health
instead of the man using the condom?

411
01:08:55,021 --> 01:09:09,417
I did not hear that from anybody. It's very
simple. These things should be discussed.

412
01:09:14,222 --> 01:09:19,921
I'll tell you why this does not come
to your mind. Shall I tell you?

413
01:09:20,822 --> 01:09:28,618
Why were you not able to answer this
simple question? Shall I tell you?

414
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:50,218
I shall not tell you. I want
to say goodbye. We meet again.

415
01:09:50,817 --> 01:09:56,821
I don't know if somebody stays over
for the other things but anyhow those

416
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:02,976
who go away, I wish you a very nice journey
and I hope you enjoyed the Organon.
