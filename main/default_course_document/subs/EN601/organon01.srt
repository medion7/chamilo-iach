1
00:00:17,191 --> 00:00:26,708
The idea of this seminar will be to discuss the main book

2
00:00:29,515 --> 00:00:38,182
which is the Organon of Hahnemann and to really exchange ideas.

3
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:47,988
What I have in my mind is to read you the paragraph, then talk to you

4
00:00:48,511 --> 00:00:53,412
concerning the meaning of what I understand to be the meaning

5
00:00:53,922 --> 00:01:02,037
underline the paragraph and then I would like you to give me your aspect

6
00:01:02,388 --> 00:01:07,872
or your understanding concerning this paragraph.

7
00:01:14,253 --> 00:01:21,014
I will start, of course, with the first paragraph of the Organon

8
00:01:21,592 --> 00:01:34,549
which says "The physician's high and only mission is to restore the sick to health,

9
00:01:34,725 --> 00:01:41,214
to cure, as it is termed".

10
00:01:41,391 --> 00:01:55,307
This is a paragraph that Hahnemann decided to put as an epitome of his experience

11
00:01:55,476 --> 00:02:03,272
so far. He intended when he was writing this... he had done all the experiments,

12
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:12,877
he had cured a lot of people, he had organized his team for provings etc.

13
00:02:13,044 --> 00:02:26,308
and he'd being a physician all his life and having been disappointed from what he was

14
00:02:26,595 --> 00:02:41,063
practicing before, he was totally disappointed as you know from the conventional way

15
00:02:41,617 --> 00:02:46,204
of treating and he wrote this paragraph.

16
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:59,567
Actually this paragraph contains for me all his aspirations and all his experience

17
00:03:00,136 --> 00:03:10,787
in medicine. He was full of different ideas, theories of his time etc.

18
00:03:12,675 --> 00:03:27,137
And suddenly he found a system which is effective, which can cure without side effects.

19
00:03:30,407 --> 00:03:39,393
He was so excited with his new discovery and he says

20
00:03:45,201 --> 00:03:55,824
just to hell with all these theories and aspects, ways of practicing medicine.

21
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:06,009
He says "The physician's high...", "highest", actually should be the correct expression

22
00:04:06,778 --> 00:04:18,090
"... and only mission". Here the emphasis is "only mission".

23
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:27,994
You can understand his mentality and his way of thinking when he says

24
00:04:28,957 --> 00:04:40,466
the physician has a mission, not a profession and the physician's highest and only

25
00:04:42,817 --> 00:04:48,235
calling is to cure the sick.

26
00:04:52,670 --> 00:05:02,141
For him the idea is that unless somebody is concentrated upon the idea of curing

27
00:05:03,362 --> 00:05:10,105
the people cannot fulfill his mission as a doctor, as a physician.

28
00:05:11,272 --> 00:05:18,089
This is the physician's only calling, highest and only calling.

29
00:05:19,998 --> 00:05:31,488
If we go to compare with what is going on today in conventional medicine

30
00:05:32,793 --> 00:05:40,707
we'll see what a distance there is between the concept of Hahnemann and the concept

31
00:05:42,236 --> 00:05:45,223
of contemporary doctors.

32
00:05:53,758 --> 00:06:04,689
The contemporary physician is well-versed in reading some medical tests

33
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:17,417
he has ordered, he will then decide that this is the best medicine for your problem.

34
00:06:20,035 --> 00:06:31,370
He will give the recipee and send you to what we all know to be a state of health

35
00:06:33,191 --> 00:06:38,958
which is worse than the previous state in which the patient came.

36
00:06:45,295 --> 00:06:55,567
This paragraph is very applicable and should be taught to all medical schools.

37
00:07:00,659 --> 00:07:13,487
You see today medicine has arrived to a state in which they say we believe only

38
00:07:14,648 --> 00:07:28,553
in evidence-based medicine. Everybody now is repeating like a parrot

39
00:07:29,774 --> 00:07:35,316
"evidence-based medicine". The same thing Hahnemann says.

40
00:07:37,594 --> 00:07:42,867
Do you know what is the difference? The difference is the understanding of what

41
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:50,902
is evidence-based medicine today than what it was evidence-based medicine in

42
00:07:51,811 --> 00:07:53,856
Hahnemann's time.

43
00:07:55,525 --> 00:07:59,721
Evidence-based medicine in Hahnemann's time was to cure, simply.

44
00:08:00,817 --> 00:08:05,039
Just cure your patient. Can you cure? Yes. You have fulfilled your mission.

45
00:08:05,872 --> 00:08:16,102
Forget about the money, the prestige, all the other things that go together with that.

46
00:08:17,635 --> 00:08:25,977
And I can assure you that if you learn to do this everything else will come, naturally.

47
00:08:27,717 --> 00:08:33,610
You will have enough money to live, you will have enough prestige, you will have the

48
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:40,969
love of your patients, of the society, everything will come with this ability

49
00:08:41,945 --> 00:08:44,927
to cure the sick.

50
00:08:49,456 --> 00:08:59,083
Today evidence-based medicine... they understand... they say their own words.

51
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:06,075
Do you know what they think evidence-based medicine is?

52
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:15,755
Evidence-based medicine they understand or they want to interpret that whatever

53
00:09:17,662 --> 00:09:28,988
you do, you have to be able to prove it. Why this person is cured?

54
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:41,458
Because we gave antibiotics which cure the specific bacteria and therefore we have

55
00:09:42,228 --> 00:09:56,116
the evidence that this medicine kills the microbes. This is evidence-based medicine.

56
00:10:05,794 --> 00:10:15,586
In a Congress in America somebody, I have inside information...

57
00:10:19,192 --> 00:10:24,397
There was a congress in America with professors and discussing evidence-based

58
00:10:25,095 --> 00:10:26,691
medicine...

59
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:33,413
One of the professors got up and said "Do you really realize what you are saying?"

60
00:10:35,913 --> 00:10:44,688
Everybody was amazed. Homeopaths will come and according to this dictum

61
00:10:45,126 --> 00:10:53,263
they will say that we can only have evidence-based medicine, that means we can only

62
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:57,528
prove that we cure people.

63
00:11:02,201 --> 00:11:21,930
So there was actually a big realization and after this international Congress

64
00:11:23,544 --> 00:11:32,902
the evidence-based medicine idea was much reduced and became a low profile idea.

65
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:39,599
Otherwise they would have promoted aggressively all over the world.

66
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:47,565
You want to say that you cure this patient, first you prove that what you prescribe is

67
00:11:48,401 --> 00:11:52,299
affecting in this and that way the organism.

68
00:11:53,139 --> 00:12:02,677
They thought through this idea they will kill all alternative medicine.

69
00:12:09,315 --> 00:12:14,660
You are a psychiatrist and you do psychotherapy. How can you prove?

70
00:12:15,921 --> 00:12:22,644
What did you do? Nothing. And you prove not, out! Which is the idea?

71
00:12:24,584 --> 00:12:30,392
That only the medicine that we produce as a pharmaceutical industry is the only

72
00:12:31,633 --> 00:12:38,578
medicine that has a proof that it can cure and we have the evidence.

73
00:12:39,778 --> 00:12:42,350
It was a big mistake for them.

74
00:12:44,924 --> 00:12:47,633
Because as this professor said...

75
00:12:48,912 --> 00:12:56,712
By chance inside this Congress there was a professor who was my patient.

76
00:12:59,225 --> 00:13:05,593
So he says "George, I must tell you I was participating in this Congress

77
00:13:07,478 --> 00:13:15,194
and somebody, not myself, somebody else a very famous, very hard conventional

78
00:13:16,867 --> 00:13:25,715
professor got up and said "Be careful, the homeopaths will use these dictum in their

79
00:13:27,929 --> 00:13:31,331
favor". And that is true.

80
00:13:36,726 --> 00:13:46,714
So underneath this phrase of Hahnemann you start to understand his spiritual and

81
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:58,621
his logical mind that was really caring about the sick.

82
00:14:00,427 --> 00:14:06,969
A man who had tried to apply medicine in his time, he saw it did not work,

83
00:14:08,051 --> 00:14:14,445
gave up medicine and said "I cannot continue to destroy the people with this kind

84
00:14:16,171 --> 00:14:21,697
of medicine. I am going to start translating, make my living with these translations".

85
00:14:24,672 --> 00:14:31,102
You see how honest he was? How spiritually powerful he was?

86
00:14:33,516 --> 00:14:40,047
He gave it up, he had seven children, he says "I will start translating".

87
00:14:41,738 --> 00:14:43,860
He knew seven languages, he had studied everything.

88
00:14:45,196 --> 00:14:54,221
He was translating and earning his living and suddenly came across with the idea

89
00:14:56,021 --> 00:15:09,261
"My God, if I give China and I have a replication that produces a similarity to malaria

90
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:20,410
that means China is curing because of the similarity to malaria. Let me see.

91
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:31,669
Producing similar symptoms to malaria and China, quinine was given for malaria.

92
00:15:33,364 --> 00:15:39,068
There was explanation because it was bitter, for different other reasons.

93
00:15:40,095 --> 00:15:48,938
His reason was this medicine actually is useful because it can produce in the healthy

94
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:55,950
similar symptoms. So he tried again and again with different remedies

95
00:15:57,241 --> 00:16:02,470
and he saw the replication of different pathological states.

96
00:16:04,105 --> 00:16:07,172
He said "Oh my God, that is a huge discovery".

97
00:16:07,927 --> 00:16:16,890
And then he reads Hippocrates and finds there the idea. The idea was there.

98
00:16:17,558 --> 00:16:28,594
Hippocrates had said that with similars we cure similars. And then he found the idea in

99
00:16:29,807 --> 00:16:33,616
some other doctors that had noticed the same idea.

100
00:16:34,712 --> 00:16:44,406
And that discovery brings him finally to experiment and to apply what he found from

101
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:51,117
the experiments and finally he writes this paragraph.

102
00:16:52,374 --> 00:16:59,838
Underneath this paragraph is therefore all his life, all his beliefs, his faith, whatever...

103
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:13,094
They have said Hahnemann was a mason, he was this and that, he was whatever.

104
00:17:15,196 --> 00:17:28,420
It has nothing to do with religion. It is the belief, the faith in the goodness of a mind

105
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:36,851
which is healthy, which is powerful and which is spiritually sound.

106
00:17:39,052 --> 00:17:47,756
"I want to cure people". And the physician who is really a physician must want to do

107
00:17:48,994 --> 00:17:54,885
the same thing. This is the paragraph, what it says in a few words.

108
00:18:05,117 --> 00:18:10,430
I have not prepared anything, you may think I have prepared, you make a mistake.

109
00:18:11,816 --> 00:18:21,927
I am just thinking together with you. The idea is whether you read the Organon

110
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:29,302
and you understand it. Because when I read the Organon for the first time in 1960,

111
00:18:32,168 --> 00:18:36,818
I was reading the Organon and I said "Oh my God, it's so correct! "

112
00:18:38,481 --> 00:18:46,321
I was reading and my mind was going along with his way of thinking.

113
00:18:51,011 --> 00:18:54,356
This book was very easy for me to read and to understand.

114
00:18:55,161 --> 00:19:01,604
Later on, I found out from homeopaths that Organon was so difficult to read, so difficult

115
00:19:03,123 --> 00:19:06,700
to understand. Hahnemann writes in such a language...

116
00:19:08,274 --> 00:19:16,368
Even the Germans would come and tell me that Organon is very difficult to understand.

117
00:19:18,652 --> 00:19:27,609
I said how is this possible? And then I had decided one day to make comments on

118
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:32,917
the Organon and this is the beginning of these comments.

119
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:46,622
I would like to hear your ideas concerning the first paragraph, your questions,

120
00:19:51,147 --> 00:19:56,115
another aspect that you may have.

121
00:20:01,941 --> 00:20:11,648
Especially for Homeopathy today which, as I said, we have a lot of people

122
00:20:12,414 --> 00:20:22,904
practicing Homeopathy but curing because of placebo effect...So if you don't learn,

123
00:20:24,153 --> 00:20:31,753
you are basing your practice as a homeopath in the placebo effect.

124
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:47,390
You cannot say I practice Homeopathy, you should say I practice placebo effect.

125
00:20:53,086 --> 00:21:05,439
Placebo effect is so common. Because somebody cannot sleep and what he does?

126
00:21:08,022 --> 00:21:14,642
He makes a prayer because a prayer is believing that it is going to calm him down

127
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,989
and he can sleep. Placebo effect.

128
00:21:21,128 --> 00:21:30,105
Another one, he takes passiflora, just a drop of passiflora , he believes that

129
00:21:31,545 --> 00:21:32,941
passiflora will make him sleep.

130
00:21:33,405 --> 00:21:37,435
Another one will read a paragraph, whatever...

131
00:21:38,876 --> 00:21:52,315
But everything we will do to cure or to stop a symptom will be only according

132
00:21:53,222 --> 00:21:56,792
to the faith we have to what we are doing.

133
00:22:00,825 --> 00:22:15,428
And if this is mild, if it is something which is mild, whatever auto-suggestion we decide

134
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,503
to use, it will work.

135
00:22:21,688 --> 00:22:27,408
This is what we call auto-suggestion. This is a very well-known phenomenon

136
00:22:28,567 --> 00:22:39,003
of course, nobody denies. But to cure a condition which is really going on for years,

137
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:43,421
a chronic condition, is totally a different story.

138
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:52,363
- When I read the first paragraph of Organon, I was suddenly infected by an idea

139
00:22:54,424 --> 00:22:57,176
and I found that finally somebody says it with clear words.

140
00:22:58,743 --> 00:23:03,756
The doctor, he has to cure, it is easy. How can people make it so complicated

141
00:23:04,795 --> 00:23:07,567
when the main idea is so easy?

142
00:23:10,204 --> 00:23:15,998
Something else concerning the placebo effect which has been discussed also before.

143
00:23:18,061 --> 00:23:22,431
I'm a medical doctor, when I treat patients with Homeopathy, they often ask me

144
00:23:23,223 --> 00:23:30,466
"But now I have to believe and I have to suggest myself that it will be like that".

145
00:23:32,435 --> 00:23:36,278
And I say "No, you don't have to believe anything. What you should do is to observe

146
00:23:36,927 --> 00:23:40,289
precisely what is going on and obey to the rules..."

147
00:23:41,162 --> 00:23:42,576
- What changes happen after the remedy...

148
00:23:46,229 --> 00:23:50,927
- Yes, in detail and take care of the rules; no camphor, no coffee also... And then we will

149
00:23:51,292 --> 00:23:57,547
see and just keep open-minded and I have the impression that makes the people more

150
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,436
free from this kind of...

151
00:24:04,346 --> 00:24:08,063
- Yes. Anybody?

152
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:23,625
- I believe that of course the idea is very easy but I have many problems with the simple

153
00:24:24,727 --> 00:24:30,469
word "to cure" because men cannot cure. It is the vital force, the nature itself

154
00:24:32,081 --> 00:24:36,425
which cures. What we can do is to take off any obstacles to cure

155
00:24:38,635 --> 00:24:41,744
or to see what is preventing the disease from healing itself.

156
00:24:44,742 --> 00:24:48,077
This is really one thing which I don't like about this first paragraph that is to claim

157
00:24:50,568 --> 00:24:57,052
to cure. Because to cure is something that men cannot do. They are not healers.

158
00:24:59,145 --> 00:25:05,934
-Stephan, I understand. The second part you say.. the obstacles to cure, we will discuss

159
00:25:07,063 --> 00:25:09,395
it later in the paragraph.

160
00:25:13,246 --> 00:25:22,609
You bring up a philosophical aspect into this paragraph, which is the idea of cure.

161
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:28,435
What do we mean when we say "we cure".

162
00:25:33,386 --> 00:25:42,995
Hahnemann is more practical than a philosophical explanation of the word "cure".

163
00:25:47,535 --> 00:25:50,466
Because, as you know there's no cure in its absolute sense.

164
00:25:53,659 --> 00:26:02,562
In the absolute sense, I am cured... there is not such an idea.

165
00:26:06,744 --> 00:26:17,732
Because the process of life is such that will lead you definitely to a deterioration,

166
00:26:21,336 --> 00:26:28,092
to disease and to death. This is the natural process of life.

167
00:26:29,585 --> 00:26:43,583
So therefore, the idea of cure takes a relative importance and this relative importance

168
00:26:45,098 --> 00:26:50,209
also can be debated, what exactly do we mean.

169
00:26:55,188 --> 00:27:11,157
But if we analyze in that kind of depth the idea of cure, we will be entangled in

170
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:21,782
discussions that could be useful philosophically but not useful as practical application

171
00:27:23,315 --> 00:27:25,742
of a system of medicine.

172
00:27:29,033 --> 00:27:39,367
Hahnemann, don't forget, was a doctor who thought "I will cure people" when he went

173
00:27:40,556 --> 00:27:44,182
to the school he thought "I will learn how to cure people".

174
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:58,521
So, his idea was to relieve the pain, later on he will define what is a cure for him,

175
00:27:59,682 --> 00:28:01,916
in the paragraph, he will define it very exactly.

176
00:28:04,605 --> 00:28:15,674
But in this paragraph the word "cure" for him it is the alleviation of all the symptoms

177
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:18,892
of an organism.

178
00:28:22,496 --> 00:28:38,940
Later on, he will say it, if I have a system which alleviates all the symptoms of the

179
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:43,046
organism, I have accomplished a cure.

180
00:28:46,551 --> 00:28:52,698
But if that was true and we could at all times alleviate the system, alleviate the

181
00:28:54,151 --> 00:29:01,538
symptoms, then we have to arrive at the idea of immortality.

182
00:29:02,768 --> 00:29:11,377
Because why should I die? If I have system that every time alleviates disease...

183
00:29:14,927 --> 00:29:31,127
next month I'm 80 and I have been using Homeopathy exclusively for 52 years,

184
00:29:35,769 --> 00:29:42,016
I use exclusively Homeopathy without ever having used allopathic drugs and I manage

185
00:29:42,968 --> 00:29:51,886
to alleviate the symptoms every time but my condition today is the same as it was

186
00:29:52,433 --> 00:29:56,134
50 years ago? Of course not.

187
00:29:58,158 --> 00:30:03,518
What underneath has taken place, a deterioration of the tissues of the organism,

188
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:11,252
of the cells which they become weaker and weaker...

189
00:30:13,482 --> 00:30:14,784
So therefore there is an end.

190
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:21,330
And therefore underneath there is always the possibility of disease.

191
00:30:22,561 --> 00:30:33,165
So always the possibility of disease is lurking over there. Never mind the best

192
00:30:34,445 --> 00:30:43,380
Homeopathy you can apply. You cannot say "cure" in its absolute sense.

193
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:49,224
So I believe Stephan who is very philosophical he meant exactly that.

194
00:30:49,657 --> 00:30:53,940
What we mean by "cure". Is that, Stephan?

195
00:30:56,266 --> 00:30:58,072
So I want to proceed to the second paragraph.

196
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:15,878
"The highest ideal of cure is rapid, gentle and permanent restoration of the health,

197
00:31:18,357 --> 00:31:29,129
or removal and annihilation of the disease in its whole extent, in the shortest, most

198
00:31:30,231 --> 00:31:38,339
reliable and most harmless way, on easily comprehensible principles".

199
00:31:41,019 --> 00:31:53,372
Here again we have the experience of Hahnemann in his time with his patients

200
00:31:55,663 --> 00:32:05,264
and his fellow beings who were around him during his time of life and he was writing

201
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:14,962
that, look at this, "The highest ideal of cure is rapid", immediately.

202
00:32:15,588 --> 00:32:23,839
Many times people come and say "Well, your medicine is slow. I'm in a hurry.

203
00:32:24,995 --> 00:32:27,794
I want to get rid of my pain very fast.

204
00:32:28,466 --> 00:32:34,280
And we say "Well, it's slow but maybe it's better, a better way".

205
00:32:35,479 --> 00:32:41,675
But Hahnemann says "rapid". Rapid in comparison with what?

206
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:48,708
What he knew at that time as a possibility for a cure.

207
00:32:50,616 --> 00:33:00,297
"Gentle". Because he was so disgusted with all these kind of practices especially

208
00:33:01,235 --> 00:33:10,666
with blood letting, with leeches, draining blood, so the disease will go out

209
00:33:12,702 --> 00:33:18,257
with the blood, until people died of anemia etc.

210
00:33:21,565 --> 00:33:26,175
"Gentle and permanent restoration of the health".

211
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:33,999
Now we have to bring these ideas to our contemporary reality.

212
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:38,795
What is our contemporary reality?

213
00:33:40,817 --> 00:33:47,687
Is the cure of diseases that we treat rapid?

214
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:59,800
I'm afraid that here Hahnemann has mostly in his mind, he has the acute diseases.

215
00:34:07,642 --> 00:34:14,860
He has seen the amazing effect of the homeopathic remedy in acute diseases.

216
00:34:20,146 --> 00:34:29,140
He is so amazed that he will see a common cold, give a remedy and the next day is

217
00:34:30,207 --> 00:34:39,239
better. He's in a shock, in a fright and you give an Aconite and the next day the effect

218
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:46,179
of fright, anxiety and panic is gone from the one day to the other.

219
00:34:48,517 --> 00:34:54,008
There is a pneumonia and the pneumonia instead of the person goes on for 3, 5

220
00:34:56,177 --> 00:35:04,319
weeks left by himself actually by that time, it takes 3-4 weeks for him to recover from

221
00:35:04,848 --> 00:35:11,863
a pneumonia state at these days, he sees that he is cured within 4 days.

222
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:21,953
So for him it's very rapid and very gentle. And also permanent.

223
00:35:27,145 --> 00:35:36,382
Here it is something that Hahnemann could see with the organism he was dealing

224
00:35:37,247 --> 00:35:46,534
during that time. The organisms of the German people at the time were strong

225
00:35:47,974 --> 00:35:55,530
constitutions. There were so clear pictured, you give a remedy and the effect was

226
00:35:56,614 --> 00:36:03,943
amazing. Do we have the same kind of organisms today? This is the problem.

227
00:36:06,943 --> 00:36:12,784
Do we deal with the same strong constitutions today? Or today we deal with

228
00:36:14,055 --> 00:36:25,062
degenerated organisms? That you will have to battle sometimes for years before

229
00:36:26,253 --> 00:36:29,796
you can bring about a balance in such organisms.

230
00:36:32,445 --> 00:36:46,936
So therefore this rapid, gentle, permanent is for this time and as far as I am concerned

231
00:36:49,578 --> 00:36:58,442
it applies today to strong constitutions, which come to be treated for acute conditions.

232
00:37:00,341 --> 00:37:13,110
Chronic conditions, especially if they belong to lower levels of health, as we have

233
00:37:14,917 --> 00:37:21,959
explained... So according to the level of health the uppermost levels of health

234
00:37:24,226 --> 00:37:26,973
to which very few people belong, this is applicable.

235
00:37:29,657 --> 00:37:33,256
But it has to be the uppermost levels of health of people.

236
00:37:36,137 --> 00:37:43,296
Then you will see amazing reactions, never mind what is the pathology.

237
00:37:44,045 --> 00:37:49,986
The reactions will be amazing. You may see this but only for the uppermost levels

238
00:37:50,549 --> 00:37:59,539
of health. And what is the biggest problem today in our civilizations especially

239
00:38:00,469 --> 00:38:09,626
Europe and America? The people of Western civilization, as we call it, they have

240
00:38:11,437 --> 00:38:17,941
been undermined so deeply in their health that the focus of the disease has gone

241
00:38:18,858 --> 00:38:23,602
deeper and deeper to the mental and emotional side.

242
00:38:25,194 --> 00:38:34,835
That is the biggest problem we have. People are so confused mentally and emotionally.

243
00:38:37,027 --> 00:38:48,228
They are so confused because they tried a lot of experiments. A lot of experimentation.

244
00:38:53,880 --> 00:39:03,947
When I was, back in '71, in America teaching there and all kinds of crazy things were

245
00:39:04,834 --> 00:39:08,493
going on and my students, the doctors would say "do you know about that?"

246
00:39:10,855 --> 00:39:17,430
I said "please, tell me." They were relating to me all these crazy things which

247
00:39:18,655 --> 00:39:21,333
I could not understand why they do it.

248
00:39:27,072 --> 00:39:35,700
They would say, we have schools in which people go and what they do?

249
00:39:37,086 --> 00:39:50,963
They touch each other. They touch. They're in a line and you have to do all this in order

250
00:39:51,565 --> 00:40:02,899
to get the idea of being in touch with each other and you have to do all this in order to be

251
00:40:04,728 --> 00:40:15,210
able to communicate and of course from the touch to the shoulder, goes to the touch

252
00:40:16,611 --> 00:40:29,038
to the other etc... In order to do what? To excite themselves sexually.

253
00:40:31,743 --> 00:40:40,389
Why? Because they cannot be excited. Sexual excitement in an environment which is

254
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:55,409
supposed to be a specialist who will tell you how to do it, how to make love to the

255
00:40:56,762 --> 00:41:04,515
person whom you love. This is a totally crazy idea. This is automatic.

256
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:10,579
Anybody knows what to do when he is in love with somebody else.

257
00:41:11,977 --> 00:41:19,927
Automatically, instinctively. If you lose this basic instinct, then you may need

258
00:41:21,533 --> 00:41:28,807
treatment of course. And the treatment you do, if the problem has gone so deep

259
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:39,973
as not to be able to touch these basic human instinct, that means you have lost the

260
00:41:41,161 --> 00:41:52,346
possibility to be aroused sexually. You lost it totally because of the interference of the

261
00:41:53,221 --> 00:42:00,435
mental level, which is making a lot of thinking.

262
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:14,381
Critical about the other person, thinking all kind of things etc... Self-awareness.

263
00:42:19,045 --> 00:42:27,709
What is self-awareness? Self-awareness means that you are looking for yourself

264
00:42:29,015 --> 00:42:34,606
and you don't like yourself. This is self-awareness.

265
00:42:36,361 --> 00:43:00,147
What could I do? The human beings have such a possibility naturally that if you meet

266
00:43:02,245 --> 00:43:11,292
a person of the other sex, your natural tendency will be, if you like the person,

267
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:25,132
the natural tendency is to give and take in a state of non-selfishness.

268
00:43:28,793 --> 00:43:34,566
If you are aware of yourself, how I speak, how I do, how I move...

269
00:43:35,478 --> 00:43:40,927
If you were little children and you like a girl, you feel uncomfortable.

270
00:43:42,274 --> 00:43:49,714
How I speak, what I do, etc. But this is a natural protection.

271
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:57,335
It has to be like that because if you lose this natural protection, when you are 12

272
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:01,984
you start having sex. This is terrible.

273
00:44:03,803 --> 00:44:11,026
The natural protection is to be embarrassed.

274
00:44:15,701 --> 00:44:21,158
You feel embarrassed when you are in a very young age 12,13,14,15 you feel

275
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:30,317
embarrassed with the other girls/ boys, you feel embarrassed and closed.

276
00:44:31,751 --> 00:44:43,153
And this is a natural protection. Now in our society because we have been deeply

277
00:44:44,872 --> 00:44:56,833
affected by disease, once you grow you cannot let yourself to the idea of unification

278
00:44:58,686 --> 00:45:03,212
with the other. You remain self-aware.

279
00:45:03,412 --> 00:45:10,321
You make sex and at the same time your mind goes away to whatever.

280
00:45:12,351 --> 00:45:21,155
What am I doing now... Once this happens, then you separate.

281
00:45:22,779 --> 00:45:35,567
You cannot continue actually. That kind of deep disturbance in order to be cured

282
00:45:37,436 --> 00:45:46,412
needs a lot of homeopathic remedies and also a kind of very careful prescribing for

283
00:45:48,017 --> 00:45:51,953
long time. Because the problem is deep.

284
00:45:53,732 --> 00:46:00,639
Why do we say that people who are coming from villages, who are more primitive

285
00:46:01,395 --> 00:46:06,236
and instinctive and they act... they give you a case which is very clear.

286
00:46:07,862 --> 00:46:15,600
The more intellectual is a person, the worse is the case. You cannot make out.

287
00:46:17,432 --> 00:46:24,532
It can be this or it can be that. I may feel cold but this may be because... an explanation.

288
00:46:26,277 --> 00:46:29,623
I like onions but I have heard that onions they are good for me.

289
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:35,672
I take salt/ I do not take salt because I have heard that salt... And you cannot find.

290
00:46:36,221 --> 00:46:41,181
You are totally confused what this organism wants. I don't know.

291
00:46:42,838 --> 00:46:48,601
You are trying to find the basic instincts of the organism.

292
00:46:50,437 --> 00:46:58,384
The basic reactions of the organism and you cannot. Is it possible to cure such people?

293
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:13,210
If you think Ok, I have aversion to sex, woman that needs Sepia.

294
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:23,880
They take Sepia and sex desire comes back. What is this?

295
00:47:25,936 --> 00:47:33,901
This is not due to degeneration, it is due to physical imbalances.

296
00:47:36,177 --> 00:47:45,102
Physical imbalance can be affected by Homeopathy a lot and quite easily.

297
00:47:48,254 --> 00:47:56,668
But mental disturbance, the undermining of the mental or the emotional level,

298
00:47:58,279 --> 00:48:02,001
it will take very long time to cure.

299
00:48:07,536 --> 00:48:20,682
Many times you will see in your practice that a person with all these problems,

300
00:48:23,694 --> 00:48:30,613
all these psychotic problems one day due to your treatment or due to whatever

301
00:48:32,123 --> 00:48:42,612
reasons he comes to face his own problems, his own truth.

302
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:55,044
Once he comes, he realizes "I'm living in a darkness, in a confusion" and then there is

303
00:48:56,653 --> 00:49:05,197
a relief in that person. There is a big relief, an enlightment.

304
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:19,930
If what he was having was quite serious mental/ emotional disturbance, which is

305
00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:31,871
now gone in such an abrupt way to the extent that this was very serious,

306
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:36,316
to the same extent you will see this happening in his physical body.

307
00:49:38,972 --> 00:49:48,320
That's why you may start having stomach problems, you may have colitis, you may

308
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:55,863
have all kinds of physical problems etc. which can extend up to malignancy.

309
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:10,426
A person who is so deeply diseased on mental/ emotional level, if I see a big change,

310
00:50:12,133 --> 00:50:18,164
I will expect severe problems on the physical level.

311
00:50:19,645 --> 00:50:26,033
Orthodox/ conventional medicine they know it, they call it somatization of the disease.

312
00:50:26,951 --> 00:50:37,757
They have seen it happening. Because we are living with guilt, suppressed emotions,

313
00:50:38,917 --> 00:50:49,631
suppressed grief etc. we can live years after years but these suppressed emotions,

314
00:50:50,676 --> 00:50:59,819
this deep guilt, which comes because the mother said something, created a condition

315
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:09,618
to the child, "Don't do that, it's very bad! Don't go with a man! Man is very bad..."

316
00:51:11,726 --> 00:51:17,407
The mother does not know how to handle the situation and makes an impact to the

317
00:51:18,818 --> 00:51:27,075
child and the child becomes totally impossible to have connection with the other side.

318
00:51:30,039 --> 00:51:37,346
Instead of saying wait, it's very beautiful to be in love but not now because you are 12

319
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:42,674
and your menses just started, that means you are woman...

320
00:51:45,875 --> 00:51:52,194
But when you suppress, the emotions will be there but will appear how?

321
00:51:55,313 --> 00:52:02,643
In the form of hysterical reactions, all kinds of strange reactions, shouting, in a

322
00:52:05,451 --> 00:52:09,265
very unnatural way. You say Ok, I didn't say anything.

323
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:17,937
You insulted me... You go to an American woman and you say one word a little bit

324
00:52:19,181 --> 00:52:24,999
more... and you're finished. They will take you to the court.

325
00:52:26,772 --> 00:52:31,601
You say, for God's sake I wanted to make a compliment...

326
00:52:33,866 --> 00:52:38,879
Of course the emotions are distorted, are not pure anymore. They are not emotions

327
00:52:40,109 --> 00:52:52,309
of love, they are emotions which have been poisoned by the societal, environmental,

328
00:52:53,276 --> 00:52:55,029
family conditions.

329
00:52:59,638 --> 00:53:10,066
This is the most in our societies. So Hahnemann in his second paragraph talks about

330
00:53:11,781 --> 00:53:27,704
that time and also says further "annihilation of the disease in its whole extent".

331
00:53:30,899 --> 00:53:36,290
If you read this, you think you give a remedy and everything is finished, I cure

332
00:53:36,889 --> 00:53:47,114
everything. But Hahnemann himself realizes few years later that when you treat

333
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:56,186
chronic diseases, it's not that simple and as he thinks more and more, he sees more

334
00:53:56,671 --> 00:54:05,900
and more cases, he realizes that there are underlying problems which he calls

335
00:54:07,539 --> 00:54:14,404
the miasms. The syphilitic, the sycotic and the psoric.

336
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:27,611
He establishes these 3 miasms as a reason for not being cured diseases easily.

337
00:54:39,351 --> 00:54:48,946
When he says later on "I realize that the disease was deep and needed a miasmatic

338
00:54:50,877 --> 00:54:57,651
treatment", it means that you cannot see in the shortest way and the annihilation

339
00:54:59,986 --> 00:55:01,504
of all the symptoms.

340
00:55:04,279 --> 00:55:13,001
Our generations they are not only affected by the 3 miasms, most of us, but we are

341
00:55:15,565 --> 00:55:20,010
affected by more miasms that we know today.

342
00:55:21,817 --> 00:55:27,790
And we have to unravel this and we have to learn all the process, what to do and how

343
00:55:29,122 --> 00:55:37,056
to do it. And this is the difficulty in Homeopathy. You have to realize what it is now

344
00:55:37,659 --> 00:55:47,283
underneath what I treated. I treat a level and a new symptomatology comes up

345
00:55:50,852 --> 00:55:52,525
as a new level.

346
00:55:56,307 --> 00:56:14,692
Paragraph 3, aphorism 3. Hahnemann who has a very systematic way of seeing things

347
00:56:16,001 --> 00:56:17,489
and thinking..

348
00:56:19,648 --> 00:56:23,438
Look at this paragraph how he says a lot of things.

349
00:56:25,065 --> 00:56:35,088
"If the physician clearly perceives what is to be cured in diseases, that is to say,

350
00:56:36,124 --> 00:56:42,608
in every individual case of disease (knowledge of disease, indication)".

351
00:56:42,808 --> 00:56:54,034
You see what he says here "If the physician clearly perceives..."

352
00:56:57,707 --> 00:57:06,489
He doesn't say "clearly sees". It is a difference between "see" and "perceive"

353
00:57:08,633 --> 00:57:18,564
because the disease is not what only we see but what we perceive, as a patient

354
00:57:19,909 --> 00:57:25,968
perceives about himself and also the doctor perceives about the patient.

355
00:57:27,725 --> 00:57:36,037
So therefore what has been reduced today is clinical examination from established

356
00:57:37,477 --> 00:57:43,545
medicine. They say, you don't have to speak. I press you. You feel pain here.

357
00:57:45,262 --> 00:57:50,597
It's a stomach pain or it's a gallbladder pain. And I press you there and there is another

358
00:57:52,507 --> 00:58:02,011
one and I hear your lungs there are some rattles in bronchi and then I see your heart,

359
00:58:04,076 --> 00:58:08,796
there are some missing beats etc... Ok, have a cardiogram, have this, have an

360
00:58:09,795 --> 00:58:13,913
examination in your lungs and come back and I give you the prescription.

361
00:58:15,941 --> 00:58:22,629
He has not spoken to the person, the patient goes out many times and he says

362
00:58:25,269 --> 00:58:28,737
"Well, he did not examine me. He did not ask me anything.

363
00:58:31,284 --> 00:58:37,412
He did not ask me to tell him what's going on with me". This is most of the time.

364
00:58:40,524 --> 00:58:47,071
Hahnemann perceives this is going to happen and that's why he says not just what

365
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:53,857
you see but he goes further to explain what he means.

366
00:58:56,553 --> 00:59:04,087
He says "in every individual case of disease".

367
00:59:09,329 --> 00:59:15,057
First says "If he perceives what is to be cured in diseases..."

368
00:59:20,731 --> 00:59:28,244
This would be an indication that Hahnemann believed in diseases.

369
00:59:30,277 --> 00:59:36,176
Believed that there are diseases that have to be cured which is not true.

370
00:59:38,591 --> 00:59:45,575
That is why he completes the phrase by saying "If he perceives what is to be cured

371
00:59:47,238 --> 00:59:54,785
in every individual case", not in a disease, Ok... In duodenal ulcer you have to close

372
00:59:56,098 --> 01:00:03,941
the ulcer. That is not enough. You have to know what is curable in every

373
01:00:05,531 --> 01:00:09,920
individual case. What that means...

374
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:28,261
He realizes that in an individual case, you may understand what can be cured.

375
01:00:31,142 --> 01:00:35,984
You have to be able to have the knowledge in quotation.

376
01:00:37,555 --> 01:00:41,956
It says "knowledge of the disease and indications". You have the knowledge of

377
01:00:42,983 --> 01:00:53,319
diseases but you have to perceive what can be cured in this individual case.

378
01:00:54,310 --> 01:01:00,587
Which is something that we do of course because we know we cannot do otherwise.

379
01:01:02,807 --> 01:01:10,552
In a particular case we can say we can cure so far or so much...

380
01:01:18,711 --> 01:01:29,802
And what is more interesting is that many times the homeopaths confuse individual

381
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:43,859
characteristics of a personality, take them as symptoms and want to treat them.

382
01:01:48,381 --> 01:01:58,737
Every one of us has individual personality characteristics. It's a different personality.

383
01:02:04,394 --> 01:02:13,057
The fact there is here a sign that each one is different. That difference is in

384
01:02:13,963 --> 01:02:20,937
characteristics of personality. Everyone has his own characteristics.

385
01:02:22,316 --> 01:02:26,983
If you take all together the characteristics, the total characteristics of the personality

386
01:02:28,525 --> 01:02:32,082
of that person, it's different from the total characteristics of another person.

387
01:02:35,621 --> 01:02:43,890
Therefore each one of us has personality characteristics, which cannot be changed.

388
01:02:47,172 --> 01:02:52,817
If you seek to change such characteristics, you will be giving remedies for ever and

389
01:02:54,209 --> 01:02:56,518
you will not be able to do it.

390
01:03:03,092 --> 01:03:07,116
Her characteristic is to be sympathetic. She's suffering...

391
01:03:09,738 --> 01:03:19,822
That kind of characteristic is in her personality. If that characteristic goes beyond

392
01:03:21,299 --> 01:03:30,700
the usual, everyday characteristic, as she knew herself and she will come and tell you

393
01:03:32,954 --> 01:03:39,366
"I am extremely sympathetic to someone who is suffering and my life has become a

394
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:49,090
hell because I cannot see anybody suffering and I suffer". That characteristic that was

395
01:03:50,463 --> 01:03:59,066
there has gone to pathology. That characteristic you can bring back to normal but not

396
01:04:00,564 --> 01:04:02,322
eliminate it all together.

397
01:04:03,634 --> 01:04:11,892
Some other personality is very hard and he's not bothered whether somebody is

398
01:04:12,569 --> 01:04:21,252
suffering or not suffering and this is a characteristic of his.

399
01:04:23,277 --> 01:04:43,506
But he says "I have become so hard that I need to inflict pain to others in order to feel

400
01:04:44,454 --> 01:04:48,751
that I'm alive, that I have some feelings".

401
01:04:49,600 --> 01:05:00,308
When the original hardness goes so far, that is pathology.

402
01:05:02,025 --> 01:05:15,261
For instance people who enjoy are the people who work in the police departments or

403
01:05:16,906 --> 01:05:26,035
in the army departments, which are the ones who inflict the punishment, who torture,

404
01:05:27,942 --> 01:05:29,734
the torturers.

405
01:05:32,612 --> 01:05:38,214
These people they have from their own characteristic, they are choosing because

406
01:05:39,495 --> 01:05:47,211
they are hard in their character. When such people that are choosing to inflict torture

407
01:05:48,550 --> 01:05:58,554
on the prisoners, they enjoy this in order to be able to feel some joy... that is a problem.

408
01:06:01,176 --> 01:06:10,849
That is pathology. You can take into consideration this, the exaggeration of his particular

409
01:06:12,592 --> 01:06:15,052
quality and treat it.

410
01:06:22,423 --> 01:06:32,282
Hahnemann says you must perceive what can be treated, don't go as far as trying to

411
01:06:33,604 --> 01:06:42,155
change the personality of the person. When you perceive what can be treated, then...

412
01:06:52,138 --> 01:07:01,747
that is a knowledge which is beyond the knowledge of a clinician, of a medical doctor

413
01:07:03,246 --> 01:07:14,324
who knows clinical medicine. Hahnemann wants you to understand, to perceive

414
01:07:15,876 --> 01:07:22,383
with your whole being what is to be cured there.

415
01:07:26,223 --> 01:07:32,374
Where this organism has gone astray. You perceive it. You don't say it to the patient,

416
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:38,659
you don't need to explain to the patient a lot of things but you realize when you give

417
01:07:39,732 --> 01:07:41,256
the remedy, then you know whether he's coming back.

418
01:07:42,018 --> 01:07:47,712
When he comes back in the follow up, he gives you... ok, he's going good.

419
01:07:51,099 --> 01:07:57,026
That knowledge is not enough. You have understood the diseases and you have

420
01:07:57,391 --> 01:08:01,822
understood also what is to be cured in each individual case.

421
01:08:02,538 --> 01:08:17,358
That means the peculiarities of each one. But now he says "if he clearly perceives what is curative in medicine".

422
01:08:21,754 --> 01:08:28,314
So you perceive what can be cured in a disease but also you have to know what a

423
01:08:29,398 --> 01:08:31,496
remedy can cure.

424
01:08:35,019 --> 01:08:38,791
"[...] that is to say, in each individual medicine (knowledge of medicinal powers)",

425
01:08:42,961 --> 01:08:46,368
knowledge of what we know to be the Materia Medica.

426
01:08:49,622 --> 01:08:56,338
So you know what can be cured but also you have to know the Materia Medica.

427
01:08:59,366 --> 01:09:01,276
Not imagination, provings.

428
01:09:03,949 --> 01:09:10,381
"[...]and if he knows how to adapt, according to clearly defined principles"..

429
01:09:12,049 --> 01:09:16,503
Later on he will give the principles on which you can apply the medicine.

430
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:25,218
"[...]what is curative in medicines to what he has discovered to be undoubtedly morbid

431
01:09:25,937 --> 01:09:28,507
in the patient".

432
01:09:37,859 --> 01:09:43,643
Then you learn your M.M. and then you understand that this is pathology in the patient.

433
01:09:46,701 --> 01:09:54,515
And this is very important that you have a good education in conventional medicine,

434
01:09:55,902 --> 01:09:57,844
not all the details, you don't need it.

435
01:10:01,008 --> 01:10:12,277
But understanding that this is a case of cancer, it's not a case of simple influenza or

436
01:10:14,715 --> 01:10:16,727
something like that. It's a case of cancer.

437
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:20,909
This is a case of rectal cancer and not hemorrhoids.

438
01:10:25,144 --> 01:10:36,108
This is a case of cancer on the colon, it's not simple colitis.

439
01:10:40,654 --> 01:10:47,049
You have to know that, otherwise you will be in trouble one day or another.

440
01:10:54,960 --> 01:11:01,417
"[...]so that the recovery must ensue - to adapt it, as well in respect to the suitability

441
01:11:02,682 --> 01:11:09,386
of the medicine most appropriate according to its mode of action to the case before

442
01:11:10,734 --> 01:11:20,357
him (choice of the remedy, the medicine indicated), as also in respect to the exact

443
01:11:22,253 --> 01:11:26,789
mode of preparation and quantity of it required".

444
01:11:28,967 --> 01:11:32,566
The doctor has to know how the remedy was prepared, if it was prepared properly,

445
01:11:34,978 --> 01:11:42,651
first of all, and then he has to define the potency, the dose.

446
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:50,888
Dose here means potency and repetition. I think he mentions repetition.

447
01:11:56,540 --> 01:12:03,890
"[...]and the proper period of repeating the dose; - if, finally, he knows the obstacles

448
01:12:04,777 --> 01:12:10,965
to recovery in each case and is aware how to remove them, so that the restoration

449
01:12:12,559 --> 01:12:17,874
may be permanent, then he understands how to treat judiciously and rationally,

450
01:12:19,497 --> 01:12:21,865
and he is a true practitioner of the healing art".

451
01:12:23,591 --> 01:12:26,286
That means you know the disease, you know the medicine, you know how to apply

452
01:12:26,997 --> 01:12:29,383
the one to the other, you know the dose, you know the potency...

453
01:12:30,794 --> 01:12:37,230
But one more you have to know; the obstacles that prevent this patient from

454
01:12:37,918 --> 01:12:45,497
being cured. And when he says "obstacles" by that time he describes, if you have

455
01:12:47,751 --> 01:12:53,345
a little stone in your eye and you have to take the stone out, or a little piece of

456
01:12:54,027 --> 01:12:59,290
metal that is bothering you and things like that... this is not all.

457
01:13:00,688 --> 01:13:13,781
We have obstacles which can be physical obstacles and most of what we face today

458
01:13:15,689 --> 01:13:22,447
are obstacles on a mental/ emotional level. These are the worst obstacles.

459
01:13:24,767 --> 01:13:33,467
Because the society in which we live creates for us such big stresses.

460
01:13:35,587 --> 01:13:42,196
As far as profession is concerned, as far as emotional life is concerned and as far as

461
01:13:43,770 --> 01:13:53,643
social life is concerned, it creates such problems, such stresses that can be so huge

462
01:13:55,017 --> 01:13:59,488
that even the homeopathic remedy will take away a whole lot of symptoms

463
01:14:00,723 --> 01:14:03,292
because of this grief that you have, but the grief is not over.

464
01:14:04,485 --> 01:14:11,013
You have lost your son, the beloved son, your beloved mother, father

465
01:14:12,895 --> 01:14:18,427
and the remedy will be given and will take away...

466
01:14:21,237 --> 01:14:26,725
but if the obstacle is there, you have to take into consideration which is the obstacle.

467
01:14:27,940 --> 01:14:36,802
You have a child which is autistic and you feel this is a big load on your life.

468
01:14:38,488 --> 01:14:45,366
You have decided that is your mission to look after that child in the family and you

469
01:14:46,397 --> 01:14:55,826
become the victim of that family situation.

470
01:15:00,230 --> 01:15:10,178
So the doctor comes and he discusses and sees the child in his sees the mother,

471
01:15:11,312 --> 01:15:15,124
what she is suffering from and why she's suffering and all that.

472
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:27,533
She asks about the child, she says, well this is my mission in life, to look after this child.

473
01:15:29,734 --> 01:15:37,930
But this mission in life is not taken lightly. It's a mission you carry on your shoulders.

474
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:43,694
This is different from a mother who is very happy looking after the child.

475
01:15:46,527 --> 01:15:54,838
Because maybe this is a positive thing. But the stress, the obstacle to cure, the stress

476
01:15:56,341 --> 01:15:58,980
will become an obstacle.

477
01:16:00,536 --> 01:16:13,398
An obstacle to cure can be all the things we hide and we consider them as illegal.

478
01:16:15,233 --> 01:16:20,192
I have stolen money from somebody, I have killed somebody, I have an illegal affair

479
01:16:22,102 --> 01:16:33,372
and nobody knows and I keep it inside. That will become an obstacle to cure.

480
01:16:36,036 --> 01:16:40,999
Because it's not confessed. Has not come out to light.

481
01:16:46,157 --> 01:16:50,107
The person cannot see his own truth.

482
01:17:01,844 --> 01:17:09,807
If they cannot see their own truth, they remain in a dark area.

483
01:17:11,082 --> 01:17:17,060
There are dark areas inside. These dark areas, between light and dark,

484
01:17:18,540 --> 01:17:20,163
between life and death...

485
01:17:23,452 --> 01:17:26,192
Do you connect life with dark? No. Life is connected with light.

486
01:17:31,606 --> 01:17:33,744
The idea of death is connected with darkness.

487
01:17:37,513 --> 01:17:39,941
So therefore you keep these dark spots, you keep death inside.

488
01:17:45,341 --> 01:17:50,577
It will affect your lungs, it will affect your heart, it will affect your guts, it will affect

489
01:17:52,018 --> 01:17:54,943
your stomach, whatever... it will affect your body.

490
01:17:58,745 --> 01:18:07,545
And that dark spot will keep your stomach not working with a cancer and finally

491
01:18:09,172 --> 01:18:11,256
it reaches the stage of cancer.

492
01:18:14,243 --> 01:18:22,768
Therefore you give a remedy, it goes better for a while, back, repeat the remedy,

493
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:28,850
back again, change the remedy, back again...

494
01:18:34,087 --> 01:18:41,289
These are the dark areas, what is preventing the homeopathic remedy to act.

495
01:18:48,333 --> 01:18:53,179
When this can be alleviated? When the person realizes "I am a criminal.

496
01:18:55,762 --> 01:19:00,697
I have done this and that... I'm so bad...".

497
01:19:10,864 --> 01:19:24,013
Why in religions they have found that if a person wants to free himself from his own

498
01:19:26,104 --> 01:19:32,831
guilt, he has to confess and to repent.

499
01:19:35,996 --> 01:19:43,063
The monks they live without having sexual contact.

500
01:19:45,042 --> 01:19:50,726
The sexual instinct is a very powerful instinct. It has to be controlled, so there are a lot

501
01:19:53,255 --> 01:20:01,317
of fantasies... Could the monk live in a monastery with these fantasies?

502
01:20:02,807 --> 01:20:08,324
So they have found a way to get rid of the effect of the fantasies. What is it?

503
01:20:10,774 --> 01:20:20,195
For every monk there is a person, his spiritual mentor where he goes every day and

504
01:20:22,109 --> 01:20:33,478
says "I have thought, I did this, I thought very badly about other monk, I had fantasies

505
01:20:34,904 --> 01:20:47,451
about sex...". You cry, he says "Ok, you go". Next day you go again.

506
01:20:49,083 --> 01:20:55,954
Otherwise nobody can live in the monastery. If in the monastery they don't do that,

507
01:20:57,295 --> 01:21:01,974
they don't have this strategy what's going to happen? A monastery of orgies.

508
01:21:03,899 --> 01:21:08,595
Orgies take place in the monastery. Because everyone gets loose and the dark elements

509
01:21:10,939 --> 01:21:19,232
which are kept secret, inside, they take hold of the person and you try to cure such a

510
01:21:20,224 --> 01:21:23,179
person. Forget it. You will fail.

511
01:21:26,594 --> 01:21:34,968
All are connected. In the societies they have found such ways in order to exist

512
01:21:37,022 --> 01:21:42,340
the society in a kind of a peaceful way, so we do not kill each other.

513
01:21:43,709 --> 01:21:47,192
Otherwise we will eat up each other. We are the worst animals in the planet.

514
01:21:49,172 --> 01:21:57,842
Lions are nothing in comparison with us. We can kill by words, by actions...

515
01:22:04,568 --> 01:22:14,049
Hahnemann is so perceptive, he says you have to understand what prevents your

516
01:22:15,469 --> 01:22:19,910
treatment from being successful and you have to realize and you have to advise

517
01:22:21,912 --> 01:22:23,693
your patient accordingly.

518
01:22:28,378 --> 01:22:33,262
You see how contemporary is the Organon?

519
01:22:52,872 --> 01:22:59,837
Why Homeopathy, when it is given to a person who has not such deep problems

520
01:23:04,538 --> 01:23:15,466
still it can create a situation inside the patient that he will start telling the doctor

521
01:23:17,063 --> 01:23:21,165
next time about his life much more I have done this, I have done that,

522
01:23:23,032 --> 01:23:29,631
I was in love with this man, he did this to me and that... and then it's like a confession

523
01:23:31,655 --> 01:23:38,549
and then you give the next remedy and what do you see? The organism confesses,

524
01:23:40,753 --> 01:23:50,303
that means what is pathology inside, it brings it outside on the skin, on the light.

525
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:59,236
Bringing out a skin eruption is like a confession of the organism.

526
01:24:01,305 --> 01:24:07,125
I have spoken about this idea and they accused me for interfering with the church.

527
01:24:09,852 --> 01:24:13,374
This is absolutely stupid because we know it as a law.

528
01:24:14,541 --> 01:24:23,044
When the remedy will act, will take the internal problem outside and will present it

529
01:24:23,698 --> 01:24:28,966
as a skin eruption or an inflammation on the mucus membranes.

530
01:24:31,716 --> 01:24:44,520
This is the best processing cure. I will tell you something. Don't get depressed.

531
01:24:52,423 --> 01:24:56,402
Because I say that and it appears that I am outside of all that and you are inside...

532
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:06,697
We are all inside it these ideas. We all have shortcomings. We all have dark areas.

533
01:25:09,333 --> 01:25:15,305
Don't be "Oh my God, I have done this sin!" Don't think this way.

534
01:25:17,335 --> 01:25:23,574
Take the information and process it in a healthy way.
