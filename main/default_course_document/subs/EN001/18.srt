1
00:01:10,844 --> 00:01:21,667
So we talked about the predispositions
there and I hope you understood this point.

2
00:01:21,771 --> 00:01:27,833
This point is very important for you to understand, why?

3
00:01:28,281 --> 00:01:35,625
Because of the reactions that you
may have after giving the remedy.

4
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:51,740
The reaction can be, it's called in psycho-
therapy, "somatisation" of symptoms.

5
00:01:51,844 --> 00:01:57,354
That means from mental, emotional disturbances, the disturbance comes

6
00:01:57,458 --> 00:02:08,562
to the lower part which is the physical body. Many times what we have seen is treating

7
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:22,115
a problem in the abdomen, let us say is
a spastic colitis or an ulcer or gastritis,

8
00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:30,688
 we have the appearance of
hemorrhoids which is very disturbing.

9
00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:43,646
But since these hemorrhoids belong to the
place where the mucus membranes are joining

10
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:52,490
the skin, also you have the appearance of
 cracks on the corners, you have the

11
00:02:52,594 --> 00:03:04,938
appearance of herpes on the lips, so you
 know that your treatment is doing very well.

12
00:03:05,042 --> 00:03:13,865
Inspite of the fact, the patient may
complain a lot because the force

13
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:18,438
of the disturbance is the same.

14
00:03:20,552 --> 00:03:29,958
The force is not reduced, the quantity
is not reduced, the place is changing.

15
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:42,229
And eventually of course, it will be reduced as well. That means, an eczema which comes

16
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:56,219
 inside has the same force - itching- if it
 is a severe eczema you itch the whole night.

17
00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:11,198
Instead you have anxiety the whole night
and restlessness and feeling cold and stiff.

18
00:04:11,302 --> 00:04:19,073
You give the remedy and then you have the whole night you scratch, but this is the only

19
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:30,813
way you can cure. You have to know that.
That it went the right direction.

20
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:48,740
Now so far, we have been talking about one individual. Its structure and how it behaves

21
00:04:48,844 --> 00:04:51,844
 in health and disease.

22
00:05:02,573 --> 00:05:14,625
-When the level changes from mental to psychological, does the force come out

23
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:20,958
always at the same level?
Can it be at different level?

24
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:55,000
-Usually comes to the same level.
 For instance, a severe heart problem

25
00:05:55,104 --> 00:06:08,063
or a severe lung problem will have
as a result a severe skin eruption.

26
00:06:14,948 --> 00:06:29,792
The person is going to suffer quite a lot. But
 this happens if we have structural problems.

27
00:06:32,271 --> 00:06:44,896
That means pathologoanatomical problems,
 if we have really lesions in the organs.

28
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:00,198
If the problem is functional,
then it is light in any case.

29
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:17,865
The problem is here on the mental level,
but it is low on the mental level.

30
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:23,021
So when it comes, it comes out here.

31
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:35,396
 These levels we call them, functional levels.

32
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:44,458
So either you will not have the appearance but very little manifestation on the skin or not at all.

33
00:07:48,885 --> 00:08:01,229
In any case what is my experience is that,
for instance, you treat somebody who is sick

34
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:08,760
in this level and you give a remedy
and he becomes quite well and

35
00:08:08,865 --> 00:08:15,198
no manifestations in the skin
or the mucus membranes.

36
00:08:15,302 --> 00:08:24,563
After 2 or 3 years, that means it takes
very long time before it's organizing

37
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:29,479
something here in the skin.

38
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:39,406
You may be treating a case and
it appears to be well, totally well,

39
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:51,979
but after 2-3 years there is manifestation
of acne type in a grown up person

40
00:08:52,083 --> 00:09:02,844
 or some pimples, or some athlete's foot;
these are the least disturbing things

41
00:09:02,948 --> 00:09:06,438
that you can experience.

42
00:09:22,042 --> 00:09:36,896
We see here the direction of cure, it goes from inside to the outside and from up, downwards.

43
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,510
Here you see the stress going
from outside to the inside.

44
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:47,583
Of course we cannot show
all the possibilities.

45
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:59,708
A skin eruption which is on that side, will
manifest if it goes right to the mental,

46
00:09:59,813 --> 00:10:08,958
with problems on that level. Much lower.

47
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:18,760
If it goes to the physical, it will manifest
more or less on the same level.

48
00:10:18,865 --> 00:10:26,813
That means in practice,
you are treating somebody

49
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:31,865
whom you are thinking is not very ill.

50
00:10:32,594 --> 00:10:43,729
He has some phobias, some anxieties, these phobias and anxieties are really quite deep.

51
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:50,844
You give the remedy and then you see
a manifestation on the physical level

52
00:10:50,948 --> 00:11:01,625
which is too much. It breaks out into the
body with great force; which means

53
00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:12,042
 you have not understood the seriousness of
the mental-emotional condition of the person.

54
00:11:19,177 --> 00:11:33,135
I remember back in 1969 or 70 a case
sent to us by the French embassy,

55
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:42,479
the boy of the French ambassador in Athens.
He came from France where he was treated

56
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:52,229
 homeopathically with mixtures of remedies.
 He had severe asthma.

57
00:11:52,333 --> 00:12:06,635
He was taking cortisone and pills.
With a note, 'don't give Sulphur to that boy'.

58
00:12:09,927 --> 00:12:15,229
The French Homeopaths giving different
remedies, they have found out that whenever

59
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:23,854
 they gave Sulphur, there was a big
reaction and immediately they jumped

60
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:33,844
with 20 other remedies to stop the reactions.
 The boy was still with cortisone and

61
00:12:33,948 --> 00:12:44,958
bronchodilators. Of course, we gave Suphur.
We explained what is going to happen

62
00:12:45,063 --> 00:12:52,333
 and the boy was cured. But unless you have
 this information, how can you do Homeopathy?

63
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:58,073
And this kind of Homeopathy was
going on for years and years.

64
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:01,021
People didn't know what they were doing.

65
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:07,302
Throwing remedies all the time,
patching up symptoms.

66
00:13:23,792 --> 00:13:42,531
-You mentioned that they are coming
physical symptoms and my question is:

67
00:13:42,635 --> 00:13:55,271
the physical symptoms can' t they be
very new or they have been existent

68
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:59,885
 and they just come up another time?

69
00:14:04,792 --> 00:14:19,688
-You remember in the model, we have weak spots, weak predispositions in different levels.

70
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:28,042
Which ones of these spots are going to be activated? Potentially we're going to

71
00:14:28,146 --> 00:14:38,865
suffer with this or this or that disease.
Now we get a stress, we get antibiotics,

72
00:14:38,969 --> 00:14:52,406
we lost our parents, our children, we are
in big grief, which of these spots are going

73
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:59,781
to be activated? It might be activated
a spot which is quite deep.

74
00:14:59,885 --> 00:15:06,021
That means the organism jumps up very
 fast, the levels of predisposition,

75
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:13,479
in the lower level and goes very deep.
That means the grief was so much

76
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:22,302
that almost killed the organism.
So it can go very fast to the heart.

77
00:15:22,792 --> 00:15:29,135
It jumped several other predispositions
or it may go straight to the mental

78
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:34,740
or to the emotional and then confusion
comes or depression comes

79
00:15:34,844 --> 00:15:38,406
 and then the person stays depressed.

80
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:46,531
The person has predispositions, lower predispositions, which might have never

81
00:15:46,635 --> 00:15:54,333
experienced, these lower predispositions
may never have been activated before.

82
00:15:54,438 --> 00:16:03,625
In such a case when you give the remedy,
 lower predispositions are activated

83
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:10,333
and we have the manifestation
of a new kind of pathology.

84
00:16:11,042 --> 00:16:21,865
But if the person had experienced already the lower and then the more higher and finally

85
00:16:21,969 --> 00:16:33,313
the highest, then the disease will
 go back in a similar pattern.

86
00:16:33,417 --> 00:16:37,667
I will give you an example.

87
00:16:41,927 --> 00:16:49,896
You have an individual, he is quite
healthy, he gets gonorrhea.

88
00:16:50,000 --> 00:17:01,198
After gonorrhea he gets condylomata.
Condylomata are treated and here he develops

89
00:17:01,302 --> 00:17:21,958
 insomnia. And then a shock comes and he becomes depressed, suicidal depression.

90
00:17:25,104 --> 00:17:33,073
When you treat, you are going to pass
 through the phase of insomnia 100 %,

91
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:39,740
he may be suffering with this insomnia 20
years and with depression he comes to you

92
00:17:39,844 --> 00:17:48,604
for 6 -9 months or 1 year. You give the
 right remedy and here is insomnia.

93
00:17:48,708 --> 00:18:05,375
But insomnia is if you sleep 4
 hours the day, this is insomnia.

94
00:18:06,198 --> 00:18:25,156
Or 1 hour the day, all this we call
insomnia. So insomnia has a depth.

95
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:34,625
Before this goes down here, it goes
 right through the whole range of insomnia,

96
00:18:34,729 --> 00:18:43,958
that means under stress the person cannot
sleep at all for a certain period of time.

97
00:18:44,062 --> 00:18:47,896
After that the organism gets tired and
 jumps on another level which

98
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,135
is now depression, suicidal depression,
everything is lost.

99
00:18:53,240 --> 00:19:03,490
Now when you treat him and you bring him
up, what part of insomnia will be activated?

100
00:19:03,594 --> 00:19:16,938
That which was the deepest for him. There
were periods where he could not sleep at all

101
00:19:17,042 --> 00:19:23,708
or he could sleep only 1 hour,
so the period after your treatment,

102
00:19:23,813 --> 00:19:34,740
 the person will sleep for 1 hour and
then for 2 hours and then for 3 hours.

103
00:19:37,531 --> 00:19:43,687
When I say 'and then', it means a period
of time and another remedy perhaps.

104
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:50,979
So you have given 2 remedies for the
depression and you have given 3 remedies

105
00:19:51,083 --> 00:20:00,667
 before you can overcome the insomnia.
So within a period of, let us say, 9 months

106
00:20:00,771 --> 00:20:07,313
 you are treating him, you are going through
the phases of insomnia and then he comes

107
00:20:07,417 --> 00:20:12,969
to the point where the condylomata  reappear.

108
00:20:29,281 --> 00:20:38,156
-When I saw the model, 2 days ago,
I had to think of a patient who came to me.

109
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:42,719
His pathology was that he had an
eczema around the nose for 6 years

110
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:49,135
which was treated with cortisone, it developed into asthma which was treated also,

111
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:54,188
then he developed an ulcer of the stomach
which was operated on and then

112
00:20:54,458 --> 00:21:01,896
 he came with an angioneurotic edema.
He had to constantly take antihistamines

113
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:10,865
and with this fear, he came to me.
According to the symptoms I gave him Sulphur

114
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:16,740
 and one month after receiving Sulphur,
 he came back to me with great problem

115
00:21:16,844 --> 00:21:26,062
because fears appeared and he remembered that he used to work in a bank and one day

116
00:21:26,167 --> 00:21:33,531
there was a bank robbery and these
fears came back strongly.

117
00:21:33,635 --> 00:21:40,823
So for me it was quite strong clue that it was
not Sulphur but Aconite and two days later

118
00:21:40,927 --> 00:21:52,771
 he had this angioneurotic edema but only
 in a small spot in the hand and then

119
00:21:52,875 --> 00:22:03,250
it disappeared completely. So what
was his basic theme, his main issue,

120
00:22:03,354 --> 00:22:06,979
was it possible for the normal
traditional Medicine

121
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:15,521
 to treat in a such a way that
his fears were somatised?

122
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:23,823
Were these physical symptoms something like
a layer which was put on top of his fears.

123
00:22:23,927 --> 00:22:32,938
Could it be that the organism tried to
manifest this fear into the physical level?

124
00:22:33,042 --> 00:22:41,781
Basically he had a strong fear of death
and then he had this angioneurotic edema

125
00:22:41,885 --> 00:22:47,427
and it seemed that everytime something happens, I get my edema,

126
00:22:47,531 --> 00:22:54,521
 I have to take my remedies and then
he experienced the same fear

127
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:58,281
as when he was in the robbery.

128
00:22:59,594 --> 00:23:17,406
-In this case what happens is that the Sulphur
is what Hahnemann says, one sided disease,

129
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:22,604
you don't have enough symptoms you
most probably gave Sulphur because

130
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:26,438
he had taken a lot of medicines,
for reasons of that type.

131
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:30,563
-No, he had Sulphur symptoms?

132
00:23:30,667 --> 00:23:33,844
-Some, yes.

133
00:23:41,375 --> 00:24:03,667
-The Sulphur is correct, what you gave as the first remedy. Then the picture was full, open.

134
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:12,896
Generally they say that Sulphur is given
 when we don't have clear picture,

135
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:21,115
we discuss later on about all these things.
This is a question now which is for

136
00:24:21,219 --> 00:24:29,229
 advanced students but anyhow I'm taking
 it up just to satisfy a little bit your curiosity.

137
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:43,531
Sulphur does not cure, it makes things
 worse because it appears that

138
00:24:43,635 --> 00:24:52,469
he gives to the person mental-emotional symptoms but at the same time

139
00:24:52,573 --> 00:25:06,844
makes the picture clear. Then Aconite is given and the cure is following, it's more complete.

140
00:25:07,865 --> 00:25:14,406
Many times we see this is happening,
when we don't have a clear picture

141
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:19,844
you give a remedy that does not cure,
it appears to make the person even worse;

142
00:25:19,948 --> 00:25:26,229
but for the one who knows Homeopathy,
makes the picture clear.

143
00:25:26,333 --> 00:25:31,667
Therefore the first remedy is needed,
it brings about a clearness of the case

144
00:25:31,771 --> 00:25:35,271
 and then the second remedy cures.

145
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:45,865
Now how is that before he did not
have or was not aware of some fears?

146
00:25:45,885 --> 00:25:52,896
That means that person had the fears suppressed in his subconscious mind

147
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:00,542
and instead of the fears, he had
the angioneurotic edema.

148
00:26:01,771 --> 00:26:12,094
When the organism becomes stronger then the force of the angioneurotic edema becomes less,

149
00:26:12,198 --> 00:26:21,906
 there is also fears which are manifesting,
then we have the completeness of the cure.

150
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:40,510
Later on, we shall see how the development
of mental-emotional symptoms in a case,

151
00:26:40,615 --> 00:26:48,021
does not always indicate wrong direction.

152
00:27:04,417 --> 00:27:16,563
You have angioneurotic edema here, on the physical level and then you have fears

153
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:26,563
and anxieties which are on this level.
So going from angioneurotic edema to this level,

154
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:36,083
it is already a promotion of health though you may have some mental emotional symptoms.

155
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:49,781
The disease on that level becomes less, this is activated also and then the remedy comes

156
00:27:49,885 --> 00:27:54,438
and then goes out, angioneurotic
edema but on that level here.

157
00:27:56,667 --> 00:28:01,490
Because he says the angioneurotic
 edema now does not have a force,

158
00:28:01,594 --> 00:28:08,844
it's not threatening the life of the person.

159
00:28:14,219 --> 00:28:21,156
We will discuss later on, in detail, this.
 We have to go step by step,

160
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:26,917
otherwise the information is so
much that it may confuse you.

161
00:28:27,021 --> 00:28:32,625
For the time being I want you to
establish this knowledge.

162
00:28:33,417 --> 00:28:41,771
Later on we have a lot of modifications
and questions and problems to solve.

163
00:28:47,042 --> 00:28:55,104
-To this problem can I ask you something?
It cannot be that Sulphur was the right

164
00:28:55,208 --> 00:29:03,938
remedy but on the wrong time?
Maybe Sulphur was constitutional.

165
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,896
Because Aconite is complementary of
Sulphur, now he is in Aconite level and

166
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,750
he gave Sulphur to the wrong time.

167
00:29:15,635 --> 00:29:23,688
-No. When you have the development
of a clear picture after the remedy,

168
00:29:23,792 --> 00:29:34,135
that means the remedy is correct.

169
00:29:35,792 --> 00:29:42,823
You will see this in the videos later on,
 when we present the videos,

170
00:29:42,927 --> 00:29:53,146
 you will see all these things and you will
be able to follow the videos, to understand.

171
00:29:54,125 --> 00:30:02,313
-He developed Aconite symptoms after Sulphur?

172
00:30:02,417 --> 00:30:12,865
-And Aconite acted. Where could you
find Aconite in the beginning?

173
00:30:13,042 --> 00:30:22,594
If you give Aconite in the beginning
could you have the same result? No.

174
00:30:23,875 --> 00:30:38,906
I don't say no because I like to say no, but because experience shows that this is the way.

175
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:50,885
Maybe some of you remember a case in
Celle with a little boy scratching after Tub.,

176
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:57,125
scratching, who was there?

177
00:30:59,167 --> 00:31:10,469
Full of eczema with celiac disease, with severe problems, I remember I prescribed first

178
00:31:10,573 --> 00:31:19,979
Tuberculinum and then after 6 months
 I prescribed Pulsatilla and it acted

179
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:28,740
 within a few days. The practitioner reported
 3 days later, the itching has gone.

180
00:31:28,844 --> 00:31:41,844
Pulsatilla was given to this boy 6 months
 before I had given Tub and I came and I said,

181
00:31:41,948 --> 00:31:56,688
now is the time for Puls. Tub seems it had aggravated tremendously the skin eruption,

182
00:31:56,792 --> 00:32:03,469
it doesn't matter. Now it remained a clear
picture of Pulsatilla, now you give Pulsatilla

183
00:32:03,573 --> 00:32:10,448
and then it acts immediately.
Before, Puls had done nothing.

184
00:32:10,552 --> 00:32:17,177
It was given 6 months before and
the boy was suffering since birth.

185
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:41,021
-Did you see from the very beginning
that Puls would be indicated after Tub?

186
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:49,604
-No. I saw it afterwards.
After Tuberculinum.

187
00:32:49,708 --> 00:32:55,448
-When you gave Tuberculinum you had the impression that it would do the cure?

188
00:32:55,552 --> 00:33:01,771
-Yes, I had the impression that Tuberculinum may cure; instead of curing, it aggravated

189
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:09,177
the situation. For me it did not aggravate
 that I know all these things

190
00:33:09,281 --> 00:33:16,479
but I cannot explain in a class which
I don't know how much you know.

191
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:30,021
What I knew is that the child was suffering with celiac disease, with a disease that cannot

192
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:42,177
absorb starches, problems with
absortion and diarrhea etc.

193
00:33:42,281 --> 00:34:05,406
That portion was ok. And then all the force of the disease came on very high level on the skin

194
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:13,021
where before the level of the skin appeared
to be here and the celiac disease was there.

195
00:34:13,125 --> 00:34:27,781
So giving him Tub., all came up in this level but created a clear picture for the next remedy.

196
00:34:27,885 --> 00:34:30,740
-So after Tuberculinum the celiac
disease was ameliorated?

197
00:34:30,844 --> 00:34:39,312
-Yes. Because he could have a better
absorption. But this does not appear outside.

198
00:34:39,417 --> 00:34:45,000
If you see the case, you will
suffer, in the whole class

199
00:34:45,104 --> 00:34:50,302
people were screaming,
what is this? what has happened?

200
00:34:52,948 --> 00:35:01,927
Because all the force is coming out, the boy
was totally covered with neurodermatitis.

201
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:12,156
I remember as long as the mother kept
it there for 1,5 hour, in the interview,

202
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:22,896
the boy was scratching constantly.
In 2 days she reported, that itching has gone.

203
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:31,427
 In 20 days the skin was clean.
And we saw the case, 6 months later,

204
00:35:31,531 --> 00:35:34,177
 it was almost totally clean.

205
00:35:41,458 --> 00:35:57,917
-Excuse me, I wish to ask you if you mean,
 when you give a remedy like in these cases,

206
00:35:58,021 --> 00:36:04,854
 and this remedy brings clear picture.
And it brings order to the symptoms

207
00:36:09,198 --> 00:36:15,708
 of the patient, so that we can recognize
 the next step, the next remedy

208
00:36:15,813 --> 00:36:18,813
then this is always the right remedy?

209
00:36:19,063 --> 00:36:25,417
-Yes, this is what I say, absolutely.

210
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:36,667
-I don't understand why Pulsatilla
did not work at the very beginning.

211
00:36:37,458 --> 00:36:47,490
-You don't understand? Neither me.
The picture of Pulsatilla is not there.

212
00:36:47,594 --> 00:36:55,125
It appears to have some symptoms.

213
00:36:56,885 --> 00:37:02,302
Ok, I'll give you another information.

214
00:37:14,969 --> 00:37:22,937
These are the big symptoms in
a case and this is the level which

215
00:37:23,042 --> 00:37:36,729
we call Tuberculinum level; then we have
 another level which is Pulsatilla.

216
00:37:40,635 --> 00:37:49,073
You take the case and you see 1,2,3...7 symptoms and you choose Pulsatilla

217
00:37:49,177 --> 00:37:55,688
because of this, this, this is
common to both and then

218
00:37:55,792 --> 00:38:06,813
you decide the first remedy is
Pulsatilla, ok?  Nothing happens.

219
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:23,104
You choose Pulsatilla why? Because
some of the symptoms of Pulsatilla

220
00:38:23,208 --> 00:38:28,094
are manifesting in the case
and you have to choose.

221
00:38:28,198 --> 00:38:37,198
The cases I show you, all the cases you are going to study are cases of that type.

222
00:38:37,302 --> 00:38:46,552
There are shooting up symptoms of the underlying remedy or supposed to be,

223
00:38:46,656 --> 00:38:53,740
you do not know and all the time you
have to choose if I take this, this and that

224
00:38:53,844 --> 00:39:05,771
 is Tuberculinum, if I take this, this, this
and that is Pulsatilla. What shall I take?

225
00:39:05,792 --> 00:39:10,198
And you say, I take Tuberculinum
 because this is very important,

226
00:39:10,302 --> 00:39:16,406
too important symptoms and then I choose Tuberculinum. That's all the difference.

227
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:21,177
When the Tuberculinum goes
away, then what it stays?

228
00:39:21,281 --> 00:39:25,448
 It stays the clear picture of
 Pulsatilla underneath.

229
00:39:25,552 --> 00:39:35,948
Then you give Pulsatilla and
there is beautiful cure.

230
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:43,458
In this category falls the
example that he's giving.

231
00:39:54,083 --> 00:40:07,531
-I had a patient, she had breast cancer.
 They had operated her and

232
00:40:07,635 --> 00:40:14,000
and in two weeks after she made
hysterectomy.

233
00:40:14,104 --> 00:40:21,396
It was too much for my knowledge so
 I asked a colleague and he gave Tuberculinum.

234
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:30,531
And after 3 days the woman developed
very severe skin rash at the whole leg

235
00:40:30,635 --> 00:40:40,521
 that took 5 months, it looked terrible.
They also removed all the lymph glands

236
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:46,333
and so she had big swelling of legs.

237
00:40:54,417 --> 00:41:02,823
-Before you continue I will tell you
something so the class will not think that

238
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:07,146
 because you said it like this, I said it like that.

239
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:12,354
Now in this case what may happen?
The possibilities.

240
00:41:12,458 --> 00:41:20,688
When you see severe skin eruption,
severe, developing after cancer and the

241
00:41:20,792 --> 00:41:29,490
skin eruption goes away in 6 months,
 it's no good. That means

242
00:41:29,594 --> 00:41:36,604
you have to expect that if the
problem was really severe

243
00:41:36,708 --> 00:41:46,135
this problem has to last for years
 perhaps and be worse and worse.

244
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:54,708
If you see this coming out, then most probably the cancer will return or the inner state will return.

245
00:41:54,844 --> 00:42:01,146
-The woman got fistula between rectum
and vagina and she got operated on this

246
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:05,177
and then in 8 days she was dead.

247
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:15,552
-I said that because I would give the explanation afterwards, you would think oh he makes it up.

248
00:42:16,375 --> 00:42:30,823
I knew exactly what you are going to say. You realize how much the information is important.

249
00:42:30,927 --> 00:42:40,573
It is so important, if you can
appreciate what I'm giving you.

250
00:42:43,458 --> 00:42:50,115
When I see this, I see the organism
making an effort, it's not strong enough,

251
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:59,969
the whole thing is going to go back and most probably will have results which are fatal.

252
00:43:06,729 --> 00:43:15,979
-George can I ask you something?
In this case when the person is so sick,

253
00:43:16,083 --> 00:43:25,531
she had cancer, is it possible to
become even after the best remedy

254
00:43:25,635 --> 00:43:39,219
 after some days such a skin problem?
 I thought it's the wrong remedy.

255
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:47,229
-No, no, no. The wrong remedy cannot do
 this reaction. Tuberculinum is correct,

256
00:43:47,333 --> 00:44:02,094
the problem is....
 Here we have the possibility

257
00:44:02,125 --> 00:44:08,740
 to give... during the eruption state,
maybe another remedy is appearing.

258
00:44:08,844 --> 00:44:16,437
If we don't give it to push forward the organism, then most probably we lost a chance.

259
00:44:16,542 --> 00:44:30,333
The organism makes a tremendous effort but after a while it's coming back. That' s no good.

260
00:44:30,438 --> 00:44:37,938
If by chance you see the next remedy,
after Tuberculinum, more eruption,

261
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:42,896
 then the next remedy, more eruption,
 then there is a chance.

262
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:56,979
But I also say this. If the type of the cancer
 is not of a very malignant type;

263
00:44:57,083 --> 00:45:04,781
for me cancers are not all the same. Now
they recognize, also officially, different types

264
00:45:04,885 --> 00:45:16,781
 and different prognosis. So in
"non malignant" cancer, you may get

265
00:45:16,885 --> 00:45:25,375
reactions which even such
a reaction will be sufficient.

266
00:45:25,479 --> 00:45:33,271
But in a really malignant cancer,
if you get such a reaction

267
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:38,292
has to be really, really strong.

268
00:45:39,865 --> 00:45:48,917
-This would be different if different
potency would be given.

269
00:45:49,021 --> 00:45:58,802
-I doubt it. This reaction is very good.
 It's the optimal.

270
00:45:58,906 --> 00:46:05,938
Now whether she needed another dose of Tuberculinum when it started going back,

271
00:46:06,042 --> 00:46:14,510
or another remedy, I don't know but we are dealing here with very serious condition.

272
00:46:14,615 --> 00:46:20,094
So you have to know exactly what you
are doing and what possibilities are

273
00:46:20,198 --> 00:46:24,354
and what prognosis are etc.

274
00:46:25,125 --> 00:46:35,896
What I did just now, is usual.
 I do it all the time, to predict, why?

275
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:43,688
Because of this information. Because
 I understood or I found out

276
00:46:43,792 --> 00:46:51,417
by observation these things that
I'm trying to give you as knowledge.

277
00:47:09,417 --> 00:47:14,792
I want to take you on another level.

278
00:47:35,417 --> 00:47:48,854
The diagram says on the top, ideal state,
absolute health and the last one says, death

279
00:47:48,958 --> 00:47:54,885
and in between, increasing
degree of entropy.

280
00:47:54,969 --> 00:48:05,958
Entropy is the third law of physics which
 says that everything tends to go

281
00:48:06,063 --> 00:48:29,625
into a kind of chaos, chaotic situation.
Towards dissolution, towards disintegration.

282
00:48:34,615 --> 00:48:44,906
This law also is applying on
the human bodies as well.

283
00:48:45,104 --> 00:49:01,250
We have several levels of health
on which we find ourselves.

284
00:49:01,354 --> 00:49:13,885
Each one of us belongs to one of
these 12 levels of heatlh.

285
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:26,760
The levels are 12 or there are 112
I don't know, of course I don't know.

286
00:49:26,865 --> 00:49:34,250
I'm just giving a symbolic idea
of my observation concerning

287
00:49:34,354 --> 00:49:38,917
 the human organism and human health.

288
00:49:39,458 --> 00:49:45,146
Human health you can categorize
 in different levels.

289
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:59,813
So each one of us belongs to those
 levels. What it shows is that we are,

290
00:49:59,917 --> 00:50:14,271
 let us say, all of us in level E. When we are in good condition we wake up in the morning

291
00:50:14,375 --> 00:50:24,063
and we feel good. We are fluctuating
in the upper part of the level E.

292
00:50:24,167 --> 00:50:30,938
Then we get very tired in the evening
and we fluctuate in level E

293
00:50:31,042 --> 00:50:36,938
still but on a lower part of this level.
And because we fluctuate there

294
00:50:37,042 --> 00:50:44,604
 for several days because of giving too many lectures, walking too much, exhausting

295
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:57,917
oneself, then you are getting an influenza and then because you are getting the influenza

296
00:50:58,021 --> 00:51:05,708
and you still continue to exhaust yourself,
then the influenza goes into pneumonia.

297
00:51:05,813 --> 00:51:13,531
Now you reached the bottom part of
your level. This is dangerous.

298
00:51:13,635 --> 00:51:22,115
At this moment you better be careful.
At this moment there is a possibility

299
00:51:22,219 --> 00:51:36,229
 of jumping a level and go to level F.
At this moment means that the predisposition

300
00:51:36,333 --> 00:51:44,021
 spots which I showed you which are
 on a higher and more deep level

301
00:51:44,125 --> 00:51:54,156
can be activated and from one day to the
other, you have the development

302
00:51:54,260 --> 00:52:01,646
of a serious chronic condition for which you
have the predisposition that was kept there

303
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:10,750
 dormant but under the influence of drugs
here, because in pneumonia you take

304
00:52:11,083 --> 00:52:18,917
antibiotics. You take antibiotics and you
wake up the next day with asthma.

305
00:52:19,021 --> 00:52:28,240
And the asthma now is going to remain
the rest of your life in level F.

306
00:52:35,479 --> 00:52:44,229
So here while you are in level F, again
you display the same possibilities,

307
00:52:44,333 --> 00:52:51,198
going higher in level F where you have
dyspnoia, where you can live without

308
00:52:51,302 --> 00:52:59,604
 some bronchodilators but then you
exert yourself, you go down, you need

309
00:52:59,708 --> 00:53:06,938
bronchodilators, you need cortisone and eventually you need cortisone all the time.

310
00:53:07,042 --> 00:53:13,563
And you are fluctuating there in
the bottom of level F, cortisone, cortisone,

311
00:53:13,667 --> 00:53:25,646
 and one day asthma is going away and
you find yourself in severe anxiety state.

312
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:28,948
Fears, anxieties, etc.

313
00:53:36,219 --> 00:53:43,198
-How can you see that it's a different level and the constant decrease of the dynamics?

314
00:53:43,302 --> 00:53:56,854
-What indicates the disease itself; the
symptoms that you are getting.

315
00:53:56,958 --> 00:54:05,021
You see we have names for diseases.
I think you are in Medicine, right?

316
00:54:05,125 --> 00:54:18,375
So when you go to the hospital they tell you,
dear sir you are having diabetes mellitus.

317
00:54:18,479 --> 00:54:25,708
So from one moment to the other you
have gone into the state where your

318
00:54:25,813 --> 00:54:32,802
 pancreas has broken down and says,
 I can't handle it anymore

319
00:54:32,906 --> 00:54:40,510
and then the islands of Langerhans are destroyed and then you have

320
00:54:40,615 --> 00:54:46,333
the raise of sugar in the body. From
that moment you are a diabetic.

321
00:54:47,125 --> 00:54:50,781
That indicates that you have jumped level.

322
00:54:50,885 --> 00:55:01,177
Before you had the potentiality
but no symptoms, no problems.

323
00:55:01,281 --> 00:55:12,708
The moment the symptoms start and the disease is established then you have a new state,

324
00:55:12,813 --> 00:55:23,354
 a new level. Treating this person you have
 to get away from diabetes and jump

325
00:55:23,458 --> 00:55:32,479
again back to the state that it was
previously, of non diabetes state, clear?

326
00:55:36,688 --> 00:55:39,313
These things you have to understand
very well. If you have questions,

327
00:55:39,417 --> 00:55:47,302
please ask so everything is
 clear in your mind.

328
00:55:50,177 --> 00:56:00,406
-How does manifest diabetes who even needs insulin to go back from the diabetes state?

329
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:05,313
You said, we have to come
back from the diabetes state.

330
00:56:05,417 --> 00:56:16,271
-I said, if by treating this case you bring
 him back to the non-diabetic state

331
00:56:16,375 --> 00:56:25,510
that means you have taken this person
a level upwards again, towards health.

332
00:56:25,615 --> 00:56:34,781
Where the stress that was on that level, a stress that found you in this lower part of your level,

333
00:56:34,885 --> 00:56:43,813
can push you down to a new level,
which is a stress of whatever type.

334
00:56:46,125 --> 00:56:54,115
You are tired, you have been in a hospital,
you are afraid that if you lose your father

335
00:56:55,302 --> 00:57:04,854
you lose everything; my father is supporting me, you run back and forwards from the hospital.

336
00:57:04,958 --> 00:57:12,000
 And then one day the father dies
and the grief instead of being

337
00:57:12,104 --> 00:57:21,896
expressed with shouting, with crying,
 is kept inside and then diabetes

338
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,760
from one day to the other.

339
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:32,042
Now what type of diabetes will
depend on your predisposition.

340
00:57:32,146 --> 00:57:34,917
Let us say, your father also had diabetes.

341
00:57:35,021 --> 00:57:46,688
You are going to be in a state of diabetes which is quite serious and may require insulin.

342
00:57:46,792 --> 00:57:59,115
We have all kind of diabetes
and there is a diabetes which is quite

343
00:57:59,219 --> 00:58:08,448
serious the infantile diabetes,
 juvenile diabetes, very serious,

344
00:58:09,198 --> 00:58:16,073
very difficult to treat and you
have the diabetes mellitus,

345
00:58:16,177 --> 00:58:20,229
we have the two types, one who is gaining
weight to the fat ones and one who is

346
00:58:20,333 --> 00:58:24,375
losing weight with combustions etc.
The better prognosis is with the

347
00:58:24,479 --> 00:58:31,500
fat persons but this is not for the moment.

348
00:58:39,083 --> 00:58:45,198
-Can the islets of Langerhans be
repaired through Homeopathy ?

349
00:58:45,302 --> 00:58:54,979
-And I say yes it can be repaired.
We have seen cases which even

350
00:58:55,083 --> 00:59:12,167
require insulin to exist, recent cases
where they can be cured.

351
00:59:15,083 --> 00:59:28,969
 As you may also understand, nobody asked.
Ok, I'm in level E, can I ever go to level D?

352
00:59:35,479 --> 00:59:47,958
-Miasm is considerable? Can you explain
about miasm how it relates to this diagram?

353
00:59:48,063 --> 01:00:02,896
-In this level E you already have
at least two miasmatic layers.

354
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:11,625
The deeper you go the more the complication, the more the severity of the disease

355
01:00:11,729 --> 01:00:18,417
 and the more the miasmatic complications,
 we talk later on about it.

356
01:00:33,458 --> 01:00:37,271
-As a baby we can be born
 into any level, yes?

357
01:00:41,885 --> 01:00:53,188
-Absolutely yes. You can be born,
a baby with epidermolysis bullosa,

358
01:00:53,292 --> 01:01:03,438
I said the other day, is born right
to the bottom, the last level.

359
01:01:03,542 --> 01:01:17,281
Babies born with severe cancer which makes them die within a few years, belong to this level.

360
01:01:25,625 --> 01:01:32,625
The question is can we jump from E to D?

361
01:01:39,625 --> 01:01:46,354
Let us say, the person comes here when
he is diabetic and you give a remedy

362
01:01:46,458 --> 01:01:54,521
and you bring him back to this level where
 he had again the previous conditions

363
01:01:54,625 --> 01:02:02,667
where he was getting easily
influenzas and things like that.

364
01:02:04,969 --> 01:02:14,635
The possibility in these levels is that with the correct remedy you can jump one more level.

365
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:31,688
Perhaps in our litterature the idea is given that with correct prescription you can reach level A.

366
01:02:31,792 --> 01:02:36,135
This is not true.
This cannot be done.

367
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:43,021
Level A we cannot reach, it belongs to
the lucky people who are born with

368
01:02:43,125 --> 01:02:54,760
very strong constitution and they are close
 to level A and then with a little remedy,

369
01:02:54,865 --> 01:03:08,000
 they jump level, they go to the next. But this
 is only for people who belong to level B.

370
01:03:08,792 --> 01:03:19,865
Or people who were level A and went down
to B. Then with one remedy we push them up.

371
01:03:19,969 --> 01:03:23,958
These are people who are
 living over 90 years old

372
01:03:24,063 --> 01:03:29,396
 and are having a good
hereditary predisposition.
