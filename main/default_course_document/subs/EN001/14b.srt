1
00:00:20,167 --> 00:00:39,625
As we have 3 levels, we have the spiritual,
the psychic and we have the physical level.

2
00:00:39,948 --> 00:00:47,906
We are concentrating on the death of the physical body and we say serious!

3
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:56,365
What about the death of the spiritual level
and the death of the psychic level?

4
00:00:57,677 --> 00:01:05,833
A death here is more serious than this
death; it's very strange but it is true.

5
00:01:06,187 --> 00:01:09,969
A death here is very very serious.

6
00:01:11,542 --> 00:01:23,479
So what do I mean by death on the
spiritual level? You'll be surprised.

7
00:01:25,031 --> 00:01:29,948
If the establishment hears me talking,
they will kill me.

8
00:01:30,052 --> 00:01:33,635
Nobody of you belongs to the establishment.

9
00:01:39,198 --> 00:01:47,594
The cases that are spiritually dead,
 that means a person who has lost

10
00:01:47,698 --> 00:02:07,823
all kind of principles, values in life,
spiritual values, he says

11
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:17,479
it doesn't matter, kill him it's nothing
or steel his money.

12
00:02:19,365 --> 00:02:31,750
These people are preparing and eventually
go into a stage of mental derangement.

13
00:02:31,854 --> 00:02:37,063
Then you see the death behind it.

14
00:02:37,167 --> 00:02:41,667
There is nothing that moves such
an individual. It's finished.

15
00:02:42,635 --> 00:02:54,354
Unfortunately, the death of the psychic level
 may happen with the younger generations.

16
00:02:59,635 --> 00:03:08,083
They break all the rules. The rule is that
you drink clean water, it's one rule,

17
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:19,750
 you eat clean food, you breathe clean air.
 If you break all these physical rules

18
00:03:19,854 --> 00:03:24,990
then you have physical death, finished.

19
00:03:32,302 --> 00:03:39,479
Here there are rules as well, if you break
them you're finished at this level.

20
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:47,458
What are the rules here? What are
the rules on the psychic level?

21
00:03:57,104 --> 00:04:02,083
Who wants to answer this question?

22
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:08,969
-That you have clean thoughts
that you think in a positive way.

23
00:04:09,615 --> 00:04:15,948
-No, I mean on psychic level, feelings.

24
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,552
-A hardening of the feelings.

25
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:42,698
-Yes but what are the rules that if you break them, then you have hardening of the feelings.

26
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:56,031
-You should not hurt yourself or others.

27
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:07,625
-A certain respect to nature
of human beings.

28
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:12,333
-Hatred.

29
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:25,948
-I would say it starts with love for myself,
 if I can love myself I can also

30
00:05:26,052 --> 00:05:30,031
love others and be compassionate.

31
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:48,896
-The emotions which foster community
should always be the overruling ones.

32
00:06:06,615 --> 00:06:11,833
-Awareness and compassion
for the surrounding.

33
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:22,396
-You said correct things but as you may
 realize also, this is a tricky subject,

34
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:32,906
it's a sensitive subject. And you have
 in front of you a boy or a girl,

35
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:39,156
 how would you advise them, what
advice would you give them as healers

36
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:45,313
so they can protect themselves
 from becoming dead

37
00:06:45,417 --> 00:06:53,771
on the psychic level,
on the level of feelings.

38
00:06:54,813 --> 00:07:04,063
We are interested to find the rules how
 a society should raise their children

39
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:07,438
in order to be healthy on that level.

40
00:07:07,542 --> 00:07:13,531
This is actually the subject we are
talking about and you as healers

41
00:07:13,635 --> 00:07:23,417
and me as a healer, we are concerned
with this issue.This is a very serious issue.

42
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:30,750
-Not TV I would say.

43
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:47,656
- I think you are very curious about our opinion but we are also curious about your opinion.

44
00:07:57,563 --> 00:08:04,219
-It's very important for me when
 I discuss such matters.

45
00:08:04,323 --> 00:08:09,688
It's very important to receive the
opinion of the society

46
00:08:09,792 --> 00:08:15,354
what is happening outside of me, right?
 Because maybe I have some ideas

47
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:23,854
which are far away from the society and if
 I give you these ideas nobody will notice.

48
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:32,125
So I have to adapt my ideas, if it is possible,
 to your ideas, so they can be useful.

49
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:40,031
Otherwise if I tell you certain rules and
nobody can follow, there is no meaning.

50
00:08:43,437 --> 00:08:53,219
What I have found out, you see always
when I talk, I talk from experience,

51
00:08:53,323 --> 00:09:00,354
not from fantasy, theorising or
any kind of speculation.

52
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:09,542
I talk from experience and what
 I have seen is this:

53
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:18,823
As you know I've lived in India and I've lived in a time when India was not so much modernized.

54
00:09:18,927 --> 00:09:31,823
I don't know if today India starts
to get modern. By 1963-64-65,

55
00:09:31,927 --> 00:09:39,219
what I found out in the difference of
feelings between Western population

56
00:09:39,323 --> 00:09:52,042
and Indian population was something very prominent, very amazing and very obvious.

57
00:09:52,146 --> 00:09:58,646
The feelings of the Indian people
were alive; they were alive people,

58
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:08,333
with a lot of physical diseases but their feelings, feelings of love that could come easily out,

59
00:10:08,438 --> 00:10:18,990
were very alive. I could see them between
them, interacting, friends with friends.

60
00:10:20,896 --> 00:10:29,396
And in India there are some rules
concerning the feelings of young people.

61
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:36,240
And the rules are that you have to
 get married before you can have this

62
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:49,323
ultimate joy which is having a partner
and sharing with this partner that joy.

63
00:10:50,594 --> 00:11:10,750
We call it sex in the West. And I thought that maybe these people here are more right.

64
00:11:10,854 --> 00:11:18,333
 The society has remained on
psychological level, on a psychic level

65
00:11:18,438 --> 00:11:26,948
more healthy than our society which has
so much progress and so much freedom.

66
00:11:27,052 --> 00:11:33,688
So there are some rules. They had
some rules that they respected.

67
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:38,198
We, in the West,
are breaking all the rules.

68
00:11:38,302 --> 00:11:49,896
All these ancient rules that ancient societies
have established in order to keep a balance

69
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,396
in the psychological level, we are breaking
all these rules, one after the other.

70
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:07,979
So the young population of today they are
 acting prematurely for a level that has not

71
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:20,177
come, they are acting the child of 14 or 15
starting having sex is acting like a man of 25.

72
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:27,729
So if you do something which is
premature you cannot enjoy

73
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:31,458
because you don't know
the value of that.

74
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:58,979
Another observation: I saw couples
that they were married and had sex

75
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:08,188
for the first time, they never separate.

76
00:13:09,229 --> 00:13:15,906
All the other couples that have experiences especially if both parties have

77
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:25,896
sexual experiences, then the most
probable is that they will separate.

78
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:31,563
What keeps the one and what keeps the other?

79
00:13:37,302 --> 00:13:43,438
If you try to find the reason why people
 are separating you will find that

80
00:13:43,542 --> 00:13:51,240
it's the sickness of the
emotional level actually.

81
00:13:51,344 --> 00:14:02,854
She says, I don't enjoy, I like this man.
You know this idea has come into our minds,

82
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:08,333
we can enjoy, we can have anything
we like, and in this pursue of enjoyment,

83
00:14:08,438 --> 00:14:13,667
we lost enjoyment. So the younger
people, a lot of younger people

84
00:14:13,771 --> 00:14:20,479
 will come and they're acting as
if they have lived through everything.

85
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:26,063
They are 22 and nothing matters anymore.
 They have sex, they have drugs,

86
00:14:26,167 --> 00:14:35,313
they have pleasure,
so what is left for them?

87
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:47,104
Especially children from rich families and
these are the victims of our society.

88
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:56,490
The victims of good life and the victims
of effluence in the society.

89
00:14:56,594 --> 00:15:02,396
I had advised my students very
 long time ago. I said to them,

90
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:09,688
with Homeopathy you make
easy money, you live easily because

91
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:13,979
 I will teach you something which is
very valuable and you will have money.

92
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:23,938
But don't ever let your children
know that you have money

93
00:15:24,042 --> 00:15:31,063
and you can buy for them this and that.
Because you are going to spoil your children

94
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:35,688
and they are finished. Give them the
impression that if they have to win something

95
00:15:35,792 --> 00:15:44,313
they have to work for that and then they will become good children, useful and creative.

96
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:55,146
Now, some of them have problems, they did
not listen or they could not apply these rules.

97
00:15:57,927 --> 00:16:05,198
You will say, would you
concentrate in the idea of sex?

98
00:16:05,302 --> 00:16:13,563
These are the feelings. The feelings
are activated in relationships.

99
00:16:13,656 --> 00:16:17,063
Somebody said, you have to
have a relationship? Of course.

100
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:27,615
If you withdraw from society, again you can
be killing yourself but not as much as

101
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:33,063
when you are breaking
the rules on the other hand,

102
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:37,635
just becoming loose and
do whatever you like.

103
00:16:38,896 --> 00:16:45,500
It is a society which we break
 rules and then what?

104
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:59,156
And of course many things of what you
said are correct. If you want your children

105
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,531
to be influenced you have to be an
example. There is no question about that.

106
00:17:02,635 --> 00:17:07,646
You cannot theorize and tell your children
 this and that and then the children see

107
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:16,302
that you are doing the opposite.
But you, as healers, have to understand

108
00:17:16,406 --> 00:17:20,396
what makes somebody healthy.

109
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:30,552
They come to you, young boys and girls, and
 you say, please wait you will enjoy later on.

110
00:17:30,656 --> 00:17:37,063
Don't be in a hurry. You will see
later on - yes but I like him.

111
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:45,063
Ok, you like him, be just friends, keep
your emotions, keep the mystery.

112
00:17:45,167 --> 00:17:54,927
Forget it, because the children are
already influencing one another,

113
00:17:55,031 --> 00:18:04,177
they go their own ways, totally out of
control from the parents. It doesn't' matter.

114
00:18:04,281 --> 00:18:11,188
You still say, this is correct,
 you follow.

115
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:18,594
The whole society is doing like this.
My children will be different?

116
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:24,927
Yes your children can be different
and can be very nice.

117
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:42,604
You see the purity which has to
go together up to a certain stage;

118
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:49,208
 the purity is homogeneous with God.

119
00:18:53,896 --> 00:19:00,104
You see, the children who are pure,
their eyes look like angels.

120
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:03,979
And sometimes you see some grown ups.

121
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:17,615
You see the purity is there. And you say, she
has not broken the rules. She still has purity.

122
00:19:22,302 --> 00:19:25,563
I will tell you something now which
looks religious but it is not.

123
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:35,573
You go back to the history of religion
where it says, Adam and Eve were nude

124
00:19:35,677 --> 00:19:42,771
and lived in the paradise.
And suddenly the snake told them,

125
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:52,313
eat from the tree of the
knowledge of good and bad.

126
00:19:52,417 --> 00:19:59,854
Once they ate from the tree of good
and bad, they've put clothes.

127
00:20:04,813 --> 00:20:15,375
That means they became conscious
of separation between sexes.

128
00:20:15,479 --> 00:20:26,010
I am different sex than this one;
therefore I have to have shame.

129
00:20:32,146 --> 00:20:47,000
The purity was lost. I believe the society
in the future will establish itself some rules

130
00:20:47,104 --> 00:20:58,365
that children will follow. That they cannot
have sexual intercourse until they are 21.

131
00:20:59,396 --> 00:21:11,563
Children are to play, play soccer, football,
 then they start to play with computer, etc.

132
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:17,771
Each age has its own pleasures.
You cannot have a child of 12 taking

133
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:31,688
drugs and having the pleasure of drugs. And
then these people come to us to be treated.

134
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:39,688
 I look at the eyes of these young
people and they are dead on this level.

135
00:21:39,792 --> 00:21:44,260
Forget it. You know how difficult
 is to cure these people?

136
00:21:44,365 --> 00:21:49,396
Do you know how complicated
are these cases?

137
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:58,104
If the conscience of the child is
suppressed and says, it doesn't matter.

138
00:21:59,792 --> 00:22:10,083
Some people advise their children
and say, you have to survive,

139
00:22:10,188 --> 00:22:15,927
it doesn't matter if you
 step over the dead body of others.

140
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:24,062
The children say, do I have to do that?
And eventually they do it, of course.

141
00:22:27,302 --> 00:22:33,750
And they come to us, cure me, cure me.
How can I cure you?

142
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:42,312
It's very difficult to revive this than revive this one, the physical level I can revive more easily.

143
00:22:42,417 --> 00:22:53,667
But if they are dead in here, forget it. You need 20 remedies before you can revive this.

144
00:23:02,417 --> 00:23:07,688
I have spoken about Sepia or I don't know maybe we'll speak about Sepia.

145
00:23:07,792 --> 00:23:25,688
Sepia people sometimes if they go for spiritual truth or attainment, do you know what they do?

146
00:23:25,792 --> 00:23:30,646
They kill themselves in the process of
seeking spiritual enlightenment.

147
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:42,177
That means they suppress their
emotions in order to find an outlet.

148
00:23:42,281 --> 00:23:48,156
First you can't hear and you break the
rules and you're unhappy.

149
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,490
Once you're unhappy, then you seek
happiness. Where is happiness?

150
00:23:52,594 --> 00:24:06,021
Only in God, let's see who is God.
God is guru. You go to the guru.

151
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:14,417
The guru says detach and the Sepia
is ready for detachment because

152
00:24:14,521 --> 00:24:21,458
 he has not sexual desire. Detaches
until the feelings are almost dead.

153
00:24:21,563 --> 00:24:35,792
Then they go like this, they are alive
without meaning. Then they come to you

154
00:24:35,896 --> 00:24:43,750
because they have problem and
you see a dead person spiritually

155
00:24:43,854 --> 00:24:49,708
and in psychic and the body
 just moving around.

156
00:24:49,813 --> 00:24:55,708
Try to treat these cases,
because we have Sepia.

157
00:24:55,813 --> 00:25:02,063
If they are lucky, they start reviving but
 then you need a lot of treatment

158
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:06,042
before you can revive these levels.

159
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:26,104
-I find that this problem is not only
a problem of parents and society

160
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:32,198
but also a problem of babies and
small children. Once they get sick,

161
00:25:32,302 --> 00:25:39,083
they treated allopathically, they are suppressed on the emotional level and their soul gets broken.

162
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:47,375
-Absolutely but here is the same
problem. We have a society that

163
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:56,510
does not care about mental, emotional,
spiritual. We have a society that sees

164
00:25:56,615 --> 00:26:04,792
only the body. Take cortisone,
 but what happens after? Correct.

165
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:09,490
Also correct is the fact that we have
genetic predispositions.

166
00:26:09,594 --> 00:26:23,125
Now we have genetic predisposition for madness, for indifference, for depression.

167
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:33,688
So the baby comes and it's depressed or
the child is depressed at the age of 7,8,9.

168
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:43,729
They have anxieties, fears, fear of dying,
they have hypochondriasis, the children of 8.

169
00:26:43,833 --> 00:26:48,083
 They are finished, they cannot
enjoy anymore anything.

170
00:26:49,833 --> 00:26:56,729
Here if you have pains and still
you can enjoy if the soul is alive.

171
00:26:56,833 --> 00:27:01,302
Here is the enjoyment, not here.

172
00:27:02,208 --> 00:27:13,510
-I think we should start a little earlier than
the sexual reasons only, because I think

173
00:27:13,615 --> 00:27:16,688
we have to start even with the parents.

174
00:27:16,792 --> 00:27:22,177
We are very thoroughly destroyed already.
I don't know if it's only by drugs.

175
00:27:22,281 --> 00:27:25,646
I think it's because we have
the wrong values ourselves.

176
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:35,063
We are very split in what we want. We don't know. I don't know if I can give children

177
00:27:35,167 --> 00:27:39,979
new values because I'm looking for
them myself and if this was not true,

178
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:45,708
we would not need desperately
the Homeopathic treatment.

179
00:27:45,813 --> 00:27:51,156
Through all the societies I've seen so far is always the problem with the material things.

180
00:27:51,260 --> 00:28:07,552
It starts with the US...we cannot give new
 values of this kind to children.

181
00:28:07,656 --> 00:28:12,948
I think we should start much earlier
to make all the 3 levels come together.

182
00:28:13,052 --> 00:28:20,156
That means not like in Cuba that take
the children from the parents when

183
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:28,646
they are 7 and work  with them politically, for special reasons, that also destroys them.

184
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:35,771
But we have a problem in giving them emotional warmth. And you can see this in the society

185
00:28:35,875 --> 00:28:45,729
 in the ex-GDR, they always talk to the
children in the imperative, do this, do this.

186
00:28:45,833 --> 00:28:54,313
 I am from the GDR also until the age of 9,
the best thing I ever took was to work

187
00:28:54,417 --> 00:29:01,354
 with others in school. If somebody was not good in school, you had to teach him to be better.

188
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:08,104
You had to take care of your neighbor,
by that time.

189
00:29:16,229 --> 00:29:21,563
We left when I was 8 or 9.
But this was not in the west later on

190
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:27,750
we had to have another mentality
and I think this is very destructive.

191
00:29:27,854 --> 00:29:32,260
You have to fight for your own causes.
It's not my own causes,

192
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:38,438
I'm not living in this world alone.
This raises a lot of egotism

193
00:29:38,542 --> 00:29:45,198
and this is what I think we should change.
And see that there is a different God,

194
00:29:45,302 --> 00:29:53,573
not a material God. When we are dead
we're not taking these things with us.

195
00:29:57,792 --> 00:30:06,927
-It's very interesting that when we ponder about these very serious issues concerning health,

196
00:30:07,031 --> 00:30:16,500
we all agree. Then where is the problem?

197
00:30:17,521 --> 00:30:30,688
Maybe the problem is that we are too weak and we follow what the general trend is telling us.

198
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:39,729
I say, no. But you are peculiar,
they will throw stones on you.

199
00:30:42,948 --> 00:30:52,344
I believe this is correct, never mind,
you do whatever you like with me.

200
00:30:53,542 --> 00:31:02,063
So if people are standing up for their own
beliefs which is coming because they are

201
00:31:02,167 --> 00:31:12,219
different movements underneath, I don't
believe the society is going to be destroyed.

202
00:31:12,323 --> 00:31:19,594
Something will bring back this kind
of balance. We have lost our balance.

203
00:31:20,854 --> 00:31:26,281
-What I believe is that it doesn't make
much sense when we tell our children;

204
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:32,771
it goes in through one ear and out
on the other. Because we, ourselves,

205
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:39,573
are looking for the values. It's much
more important to live what we believe

206
00:31:39,677 --> 00:31:45,219
 and also this concerns the
 Homeopathic treatment.

207
00:31:45,323 --> 00:31:52,844
Lead them correctly, if they lead their
children correctly they will watch less TV,

208
00:31:52,948 --> 00:31:57,260
they will get less involved in these
activities and they will look for themselves.

209
00:31:57,365 --> 00:32:02,458
So I think through Homeopathic treatment
is very important to influence them,

210
00:32:02,563 --> 00:32:07,635
to cure them at a very early
age on the right way.

211
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:19,708
-That is true but the children will follow the general trend of what is happening.

212
00:32:22,125 --> 00:32:35,313
The American way is, unless the boy has no girlfriend at the age of 12-13 is not healthy.

213
00:32:35,417 --> 00:32:45,646
Unless we understand that this is a
wrong idea, then we accept that.

214
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:51,260
The boy is unhealthy at the age of
14 if he doesn't have girlfriend.

215
00:32:51,365 --> 00:33:00,990
But if the society is pushing the boy to
do this,  is killing the soul of the boy.

216
00:33:02,031 --> 00:33:12,021
-I would like to say one thing to this issue.
I found very often that in the appearance

217
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:22,083
they cannot bear any skin eruptions on the children. So even if they are coming with

218
00:33:22,188 --> 00:33:36,927
the babies and have some red points, they get exhausted and they always want that they

219
00:33:37,031 --> 00:33:42,240
disappear very soonly. Of course, no
cortizone but they have to disappear

220
00:33:42,344 --> 00:33:46,323
and they take Calendula and so on.

221
00:33:51,292 --> 00:33:59,552
-That' s very important issue of course.
Because if all the disturbances that we have,

222
00:33:59,656 --> 00:34:08,010
 came out to the skin, everyone
would look terrible.

223
00:34:16,875 --> 00:34:25,104
It is true, we see it many times.

224
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:46,104
There is a book that was written by a German actually who lived in Athens, in 1925.

225
00:34:46,500 --> 00:35:00,885
And he had Tuberculosis and he stayed
 in coma for a year in Berlin.

226
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:11,750
Then during this coma state,
he was living in a dream state.

227
00:35:11,854 --> 00:35:19,771
Once he came back from the coma
after a year, the doctors advised him

228
00:35:19,875 --> 00:35:23,438
 to come to Athens because the
 climate by that time was

229
00:35:23,542 --> 00:35:30,667
much good for Tuberculosis people.
He says, go to Greece.

230
00:35:30,771 --> 00:35:41,240
He got a place near Acropolis and one day he woke up in the morning and he remembered

231
00:35:41,344 --> 00:35:50,365
what he was seeing in his dream for one
year and he started writing his experiences.

232
00:35:51,187 --> 00:35:58,021
Once he finished, he was giving
German lessons to students.

233
00:35:58,125 --> 00:36:04,260
When he was going to die, he said to
one of his students who is now

234
00:36:04,365 --> 00:36:07,323
 a Professor in the University, he says,

235
00:36:07,427 --> 00:36:15,552
'take these and do whatever
you like with these notes'.

236
00:36:15,656 --> 00:36:26,594
This professor translated the notes into
Greek and published a book.

237
00:36:27,542 --> 00:36:39,000
Now in this book what is given is the
picture  of the future society.

238
00:36:39,542 --> 00:36:46,937
How the future society is going to be
 in Europe and the Western world.

239
00:36:47,042 --> 00:36:57,354
It's a fantastic book which predicts actually in 1925, he says, in the middle of the century

240
00:36:57,458 --> 00:37:11,990
1950,60 the people who will be adored, will
be the idols, will be hippies playing the guitar

241
00:37:12,094 --> 00:37:22,854
and football players. He could
not have been more accurate.

242
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:37,281
What is his name?
 Michael Jackson?

243
00:37:38,302 --> 00:38:00,719
You see this whole thing, guitars and
shouting the people to the idols.

244
00:38:05,417 --> 00:38:13,031
I don't know the names, Elton John?

245
00:38:17,458 --> 00:38:27,615
I think also one of them became a Sir.
 The English people made him.

246
00:38:28,656 --> 00:38:36,104
All this adoration in the middle of the
century and many other predictions

247
00:38:36,208 --> 00:38:42,458
 and he said by the year 2500
this is going to be the society.

248
00:38:42,562 --> 00:38:49,260
And he gives a picture of the society
in which he has lived there.

249
00:38:49,365 --> 00:39:00,792
In this society children are working up to the
age of 21. Nobody works after that age.

250
00:39:00,896 --> 00:39:06,010
All the problems are solved and after that
age, you can do whatever you like.

251
00:39:07,594 --> 00:39:14,771
Up to the age of 21 you are like a soldier, you belong to the society, you work for the society

252
00:39:14,875 --> 00:39:31,177
but no sex at all. What he says also
is that the people when they meet,

253
00:39:31,281 --> 00:39:39,063
they recognize their partner.
Once they are at that age, over 21

254
00:39:39,167 --> 00:39:48,354
 and for the first time come together boys
and girls, they recognize really their partner.

255
00:39:50,521 --> 00:40:03,542
So there is no this kind of confusion:
oh I got the wrong man or woman etc.

256
00:40:04,302 --> 00:40:15,948
The society has totally different rules
but what we see today, as healers,

257
00:40:16,052 --> 00:40:24,771
that people are coming to be healed,
the problem is here and it's very serious.

258
00:40:24,875 --> 00:40:34,156
And the secret I wanted to tell you is this.
If you see cases that the remedy is clear,

259
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:42,229
then these levels are usually
still in good condition !
