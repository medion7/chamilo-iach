1
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:46,156
So the grand rule on Homeopathy is
Similia Similibus Curentur.

2
00:00:47,583 --> 00:01:04,073
This is the grand rule which means
 that a remedy can cure if fits,

3
00:01:04,177 --> 00:01:09,156
if it is similar with the pathology of the case.

4
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:20,885
So, that means we have remedies
that we know their pathology.

5
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:36,042
I want you to understand why such
a thing is happening.

6
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:48,667
When you have a disease,
you have a symptomatology.

7
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:59,344
This symptomatology is the result of a
defence mechanism who is trying

8
00:01:59,448 --> 00:02:03,781
to re-establish itself into order.

9
00:02:03,885 --> 00:02:12,000
To bring back order into the organism
through that symptomatology.

10
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:19,052
So the symptomatology is a useful thing
 for the organism and the symptoms

11
00:02:19,156 --> 00:02:30,979
are absolutely necessary for that particular
organism in order to stay in balance, not to die.

12
00:02:31,135 --> 00:02:42,875
So we respect the symptoms of a patient whether in acute or in a chronic state.

13
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:55,625
We respect very much this symptomatology
 and we try to write down

14
00:02:55,729 --> 00:03:02,031
all the symptoms of the case
and then try to find which is the remedy,

15
00:03:02,135 --> 00:03:11,760
 which has in its pathogenesis when
it was proven in the healthy organism,

16
00:03:12,802 --> 00:03:22,448
we try to find which is the similium, which
is exactly that remedy that fits the totality.

17
00:03:24,823 --> 00:03:37,292
And then if you are given this, the patient
 is cured. Why this happens?

18
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,729
Here we have a graph, right?

19
00:03:50,292 --> 00:03:58,094
These are symptoms, strong
symptoms of the patient,

20
00:03:58,823 --> 00:04:09,135
here we have a very high fever
with its modalities.

21
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:15,115
Fever which comes in the afternoon
 4-5 pm, fever which comes

22
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:19,917
only in the morning, fever in the
evening, constant fever, whatever.

23
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:33,708
But fever is not the only symptom. He can
have also headache, strong headache,

24
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:46,844
headache with its modalities, we write them down exactly, the modalities of the fever.

25
00:04:47,021 --> 00:05:03,521
And then we have exhaustion, tremendous exhaustion and then we have

26
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:11,333
together with these fever, exhaustion etc.
we have coughing.

27
00:05:14,115 --> 00:05:27,375
And then here we have excessive thirst
and then here we have nightmares.

28
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:40,875
So you are searching to find a remedy
 with fever with a specific modality,

29
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:42,021
do you understand modality?

30
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:48,854
Anybody does not understand
some words, I'm using words

31
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:57,521
which are used in Homeopathy and
I suppose that everyone understands them.

32
00:05:57,625 --> 00:06:02,479
If somebody does not understand,
he has to ask so you can follow

33
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:10,010
step by step everything. Otherwise
it's not good, you just follow, follow,

34
00:06:10,115 --> 00:06:16,115
follow and then a confusion is created, ok?

35
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:23,385
We try to find a remedy that has fever, that
has a particular headache we are looking for,

36
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:29,115
which has a particular exhaustion,
which has the coughing, nightmares etc.

37
00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:37,313
 So that means it will be a remedy similar.

38
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:51,688
 The remedy will have more
or less a graph like this.

39
00:06:56,042 --> 00:07:07,813
If the exhaustion is very great, then
 it will have a graph like this.

40
00:07:07,917 --> 00:07:14,813
So the most characteristic of this patient
is the exhaustion he is totally exhausted,

41
00:07:14,917 --> 00:07:21,219
then the remedy has to have exhaustion
 in very great degree also.

42
00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:33,156
So for each symptom we have
intensity and modalities.

43
00:07:33,292 --> 00:07:44,000
How intensive is and what
modifies this symptom.

44
00:07:53,156 --> 00:08:07,656
If we give a similar remedy, the patient will
 be cured. There is a logic behind this.

45
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:13,583
There is a very, very clear logic.

46
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:28,292
Can anybody know why? Can you tell me
 why if you give a similar remedy

47
00:08:28,396 --> 00:08:35,083
- that means the symptoms - I'm going
to be worse, not better.

48
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:45,396
The symptoms are going to be worse
because this organism produces this graph

49
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:50,354
that means this symptomatology
as a reaction to what?

50
00:08:50,458 --> 00:09:00,740
To a bacteria, a virus or whatever.
So a bacteria has invaded my body

51
00:09:00,844 --> 00:09:05,760
or has developed within my body
and then the organism in order to

52
00:09:05,865 --> 00:09:17,229
counteract this invasion produces symptoms. And then I come and I give a remedy

53
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:23,188
which has similar symptoms. At this point
we have to be very clear because

54
00:09:23,292 --> 00:09:25,854
when we explain Homeopathy we
have to explain it in this way

55
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:34,854
that makes sense to the patient, to ourselves
to understand what we are doing and this

56
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:44,208
understanding is useful for later on when you evaluate that case, what has happened.

57
00:09:44,781 --> 00:09:49,760
Shall I give another remedy, shall
 I wait, what is this, what is that.

58
00:09:51,542 --> 00:09:55,198
Do I give a remedy for one symptom?

59
00:09:55,531 --> 00:10:01,500
I mean these questions are going to be
solved if you understand very clearly

60
00:10:01,604 --> 00:10:06,208
the mechanism of cure.

61
00:10:10,729 --> 00:10:22,146
So my question to you is why this
remedy is going to cure this patient

62
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:27,125
and not make him worse?

63
00:10:35,094 --> 00:10:38,708
There is a clear logic behind.

64
00:10:38,844 --> 00:10:48,479
 The explanation is this. If the organism
 tries to bring about a cure through

65
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:55,781
developing this symptomatology
and he cannot succeed

66
00:10:55,885 --> 00:11:02,938
because he comes to us to cure him,
that means he is suffering chronically

67
00:11:03,042 --> 00:11:11,604
 or acutely. That means that the organism is having the symptoms constantly

68
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:22,604
and through these symptoms the organism
 is trying, 'let's make it a little bit more

69
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:29,542
 this headache and then I will cure you'.
The defence mechanism behind.

70
00:11:29,646 --> 00:11:35,479
You see for those who suffer with
chronic headaches, every week

71
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:39,938
there comes a headache, every
week 3 hours come the headache,

72
00:11:40,042 --> 00:11:51,094
 every 3 hours come the pains in the
abdomen, every day or every 2nd day

73
00:11:51,198 --> 00:11:58,313
comes the pain in the gall bladder etc.
 That means the organism

74
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:10,646
That means the organism is bringing
 an epileptic fit every 5 days,
every 3 days, every day.

75
00:12:11,094 --> 00:12:20,958
This epileptic fit we claim it is an effort
 of the organism to cure itself.

76
00:12:21,417 --> 00:12:27,427
This cough is an effort of the
 organism to cure itself.

77
00:12:29,781 --> 00:12:41,656
Therefore if we strengthen by
a mechanism, if we strengthen this effort,

78
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:51,875
the organism will be cured. If we find
a way to strengthen the defences

79
00:12:51,979 --> 00:13:02,146
of the body, then the organism will be cured because the organism is saying that

80
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:11,760
'through these symptoms I try to cure myself
but I cannot, I need some extra strength

81
00:13:11,865 --> 00:13:21,375
 to make these symptoms a little bit
more so that I can overcome the disease'.

82
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:25,990
And there we come with a remedy
which is similar which

83
00:13:26,094 --> 00:13:37,521
touches the organism on an energy
level, as the student said,

84
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:50,469
and for a period of time we have an
aggravation, smaller or bigger aggravation.

85
00:13:51,469 --> 00:13:58,521
 In every case, in the homeopathic cure
we have an aggravation of the symptoms,

86
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:03,656
what we call the aggravation of the
symptoms. That means that the symptoms

87
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:12,698
will become a little bit stronger for a small
period, for a fraction of a minute sometimes,

88
00:14:12,802 --> 00:14:21,448
in an acute disease or for several days
in a case of chronic disease.

89
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:32,500
 The patient may experience an
 aggravation of the symptoms.

90
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:40,469
The symptoms become a little bit more
 or sometimes quite a lot more.

91
00:14:41,552 --> 00:14:47,271
If the symptoms become quite a
lot more then most probably

92
00:14:49,083 --> 00:15:01,042
we have given the right remedy. We shall talk about the different modifications of that.

93
00:15:01,823 --> 00:15:13,146
But giving an extra push, brings about what
the organism is not able to do by himself

94
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:26,500
and there is a release. Did you understand
this? Do you comprehend this point?

95
00:15:26,604 --> 00:15:32,625
This is a point where we have to discuss so everybody will understand very clearly.

96
00:15:32,729 --> 00:15:37,229
You have it in your mind
established very clearly.

97
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:43,854
- Dr. Vithoulkas, do you mean that if there is
no aggravation at all there is no cure?

98
00:15:47,448 --> 00:16:01,385
-Good question. I mean yes, when there
is no aggravation it cannot be a cure

99
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:04,010
with a difference.

100
00:16:04,115 --> 00:16:13,990
When this reaction has
reached its highest point,

101
00:16:14,094 --> 00:16:21,323
the reaction is almost
 imperceptible, is very little.

102
00:16:21,427 --> 00:16:32,719
The organism needs a little bit more so the patient himself does not realise the reaction.

103
00:16:32,823 --> 00:16:42,677
And usually this case is in severe,
 acute diseases, where the patient

104
00:16:42,781 --> 00:16:48,740
hardly realises the reaction,
 a little bit more fever,

105
00:16:48,844 --> 00:16:56,229
it doesn't' matter, a little bit more
headache, it doesn' t matter,

106
00:16:56,333 --> 00:17:05,604
because he is in a very bad state already.
But when we have chronic cases

107
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:13,510
there we have to be careful because
the reaction can be quite severe.

108
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:25,854
 If in chronic cases we have problems that
are functional, functional problems only

109
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:36,740
that means it is only a spasm of a
vessel which makes the problem

110
00:17:36,844 --> 00:17:42,781
with the headache and that's all.
We have different kinds of headaches,

111
00:17:42,885 --> 00:17:47,917
there are severe headaches etc.
and in Homeopathy we learn

112
00:17:48,094 --> 00:17:55,771
that each organism has
its own severity of state.

113
00:17:55,875 --> 00:18:01,354
That means, headache one person,
 headache the other person.

114
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:05,187
In this headache which looks
similar to his headache,

115
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:10,385
is much more easy to cure
 than his headache.

116
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:16,990
That means there is a depth on this headache and not a depth on that headache.

117
00:18:17,094 --> 00:18:25,708
That means that this headache will be cured without almost any perceptible aggravation.

118
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:35,531
His headache which is of a deeper kind is
 going to have a tremendous aggravation.

119
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:45,146
So it will depend on something which is
called the depth of the problem,

120
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:52,958
which depends on different characters
which we will be talking about, later on.

121
00:18:55,083 --> 00:19:01,208
I don't want to bring a lot of issues
together at the same time.

122
00:19:01,313 --> 00:19:07,146
I want to keep it clear, basic things
and then we'll elaborate as we go along,

123
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:15,042
 we will elaborate more and more
 on these issues.

124
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:23,646
But this I consider as a major
understanding of how the remedy acts.

125
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:34,802
That means that every symptom is an effort of the organism to be cured, to bring balance,

126
00:19:34,906 --> 00:19:42,760
because this organism after this will
come to a kind of a balance, like this.

127
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:51,115
That means little symptoms anymore,
they don't bother etc. he's almost well.

128
00:19:51,219 --> 00:19:54,677
Maybe at that state we can try
and give a second remedy

129
00:19:54,781 --> 00:20:01,250
or may not try even,
 to give a second remedy.

130
00:20:01,354 --> 00:20:07,604
So my first question to you will be:

131
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:51,031
Find where, in the Organon, which
paragraph, states the law of similars

132
00:20:51,135 --> 00:21:02,760
and in which paragraph Hahnemann
explains this law, how it works.

133
00:21:09,021 --> 00:21:21,667
State whether this explanation is the same as Hahnemann's or Hahnemman is different

134
00:21:21,802 --> 00:21:28,115
or my explanation is different.

135
00:22:11,021 --> 00:22:23,938
 State in which paragraph, the law of
similars is mentioned in the Organon

136
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:34,250
in which paragraph the explanation
 of how the remedy works,

137
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:44,375
and 3rd question, whether this explanation
is the same as the one I gave you here.

138
00:22:58,708 --> 00:23:12,146
The body is trying through this symptomatology,  to bring back the balance but you will say

139
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:22,406
if you have an epileptic fit is it possible that through the epileptic fit the body is trying to

140
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:31,958
cure itself? Have we ever seen a case of epilepsy where it has been cured

141
00:23:32,063 --> 00:23:45,177
through the epileptic fit? Such questions
I would expect from you. Do you understand?

142
00:23:46,198 --> 00:23:51,583
 I want you to put forward your
questions or whatever you feel,

143
00:23:52,125 --> 00:24:01,208
 well I don't understand, and we discuss
 until everything is clear in you.

144
00:24:01,313 --> 00:24:12,625
Symptoms are developing in order to
prevent a more severe or fatal outcome

145
00:24:12,729 --> 00:24:19,521
from the disease. So an epileptic fit
actually in the body which

146
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:29,052
   points out to a heavy electric discharge,

147
00:24:29,156 --> 00:24:39,188
it could have killed that organism if the
organism did not have the defence

148
00:24:39,292 --> 00:24:46,885
mechanism ready to produce that kind
 of unconsiousness and spasm etc.

149
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:57,406
So yes definitely, this is to balance the
body so it can exist, it can survive,

150
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:00,333
otherwise it can die.

151
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:08,698
But the fact remains, if we are
interested, that this points to us,

152
00:25:08,802 --> 00:25:16,146
how we shall go about finding the
remedy, by taking into consideration

153
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:21,177
all these symptoms of the patient.

154
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:27,719
- I just wanted to say that several copying strategies for people who have chronic pain

155
00:25:27,823 --> 00:25:32,250
and one of them is to increase the pain,
to go into the pain mentally and so

156
00:25:32,354 --> 00:25:36,521
they can cope with the pain, they can
reduce the pain by increasing it.

157
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:39,385
So this is similar to what
we are talking about.

158
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:51,115
-Yes. There are strategies, as you say,
that the people who are really suffering

159
00:25:51,219 --> 00:25:56,740
are trying to go into the pain and
increase the pain so it can relieve

160
00:25:56,844 --> 00:26:07,427
but always in a kind of temporary
decrease, not real cure.

161
00:26:09,271 --> 00:26:12,271
There are strategies in psychotherapy
 which are the same,

162
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:18,854
for instance somebody is fearing
microbes, he is fearing the microbes.

163
00:26:18,958 --> 00:26:22,323
In everything he touches,
he feels there are microbes.

164
00:26:22,427 --> 00:26:27,542
So there is a strategy in psychotherapy
where they take him in a bathroom

165
00:26:27,646 --> 00:26:35,365
where the bathroom is full of dirt
and say now wash your hands

166
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:43,740
into this basin and see how you feel.
I mean, you understand that the increase

167
00:26:43,844 --> 00:26:58,729
of the fear will be so great and then
this symptom which is fear of microbes,

168
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:02,656
it goes very high.

169
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:16,760
And they have observed that through
such thing we can have a cure of what ?

170
00:27:16,865 --> 00:27:19,604
Of the symptom. And this is the difference between Homeopathy and Psychotherapy.

171
00:27:24,156 --> 00:27:33,021
 Here they cure that symptom which was
over ruling the body, fear of microbes,

172
00:27:33,552 --> 00:27:37,188
 tremendous fear of
microbes and all his life is..

173
00:27:37,292 --> 00:27:41,344
and then they put him
there and then it increases

174
00:27:41,448 --> 00:27:46,521
and they find out that
this symptom goes away.

175
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:58,667
But many times they find that the organism replaces this symptom with another one.

176
00:28:00,552 --> 00:28:13,583
So therefore, the patient remains as a mental case but with a different symptomatology.

177
00:28:14,917 --> 00:28:20,406
- Mr Vithoulkas, I would like to ask, in par.2 Hahnemann uses the word gentle,

178
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:25,604
are you saying that the severe
aggravation can we call that gentle?

179
00:28:25,708 --> 00:28:36,833
-Very gentle. We call it gentle in
comparison with suffering.

180
00:28:36,938 --> 00:28:46,781
If the suffering is really severe and
for years, the aggravation of the few days

181
00:28:46,885 --> 00:28:55,031
is nothing for the patient, who is suffering
 for the last 10-15 years and after that

182
00:28:55,135 --> 00:29:10,167
to be cured. A second question, and
be careful these are questions that

183
00:29:10,271 --> 00:29:22,031
contain a catch inside, be careful.
Find in which paragraphs Hahnemann

184
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:28,958
talks about the aggravation.

185
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:48,990
And state whether this
explanation in the Organon

186
00:29:49,094 --> 00:29:56,458
 is the same as the explanation
we are giving here.

187
00:30:05,042 --> 00:30:17,188
So you will write, Hahnemann talks for aggravation on paragraph 78,103 and 104.

188
00:30:17,292 --> 00:30:23,802
The explanation is different or
it's the same. That's all I want.

189
00:30:30,156 --> 00:30:35,781
- We know that with some patients we have symptoms that depend on the presence

190
00:30:35,885 --> 00:30:44,010
or the absence of some elements in the
 body, like for example we might have goitre

191
00:30:44,115 --> 00:30:54,250
 because we lack iodine in the water. How
are we going to differentiate such symptoms

192
00:30:54,885 --> 00:30:58,917
from the symptoms that really have
 a sense in Homeopathy?

193
00:30:59,021 --> 00:31:07,073
Let's say for example, if someone
has lack of sugar in the blood

194
00:31:07,177 --> 00:31:13,688
a very simple method to correct
 this is if we give him sugar

195
00:31:13,792 --> 00:31:17,354
and not if we give him a homeopathic remedy.

196
00:31:20,135 --> 00:31:38,625
- Yes, that is correct. This is how most of us exist by doing certain supplement things in our life,

197
00:31:39,396 --> 00:31:46,854
correcting the diet, doing a little more diet
of this type than this type etc, etc.

198
00:31:46,958 --> 00:32:01,896
and these are measures on a level
which is quite superficial in order not

199
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:15,010
to suffer so much chronically.
The correct homeopathic remedy finally

200
00:32:15,115 --> 00:32:24,677
corrects the organism so it can receive the elements, the micro elements that needs,

201
00:32:24,781 --> 00:32:33,333
the vitamins, the minerals etc.,
 it can receive them from the food easily.

202
00:32:33,458 --> 00:32:38,917
Our organisms today, most of our organisms,
 are not in a position to do that.

203
00:32:39,021 --> 00:32:48,656
They are degenerated to a greater or
a lesser degree and they cannot do that.

204
00:32:48,760 --> 00:33:00,365
So some supplements sometimes are
necessary to feel better, what we call better.

205
00:33:00,469 --> 00:33:07,135
So if I take a particular mineral
 I feel better, that is true.

206
00:33:08,063 --> 00:33:16,854
The homeopathic remedy will correct
this, imbalance and this is the idea.

207
00:33:16,958 --> 00:33:24,500
So the organism will feel best with
only natural food finally.

208
00:33:24,604 --> 00:33:31,875
But many times we cannot attend
this and therefore we resort

209
00:33:31,979 --> 00:33:40,292
to different other measures to
support the organism.

210
00:33:49,167 --> 00:33:57,250
Let me complete this. What I want to say
 now is, do you understand this?

211
00:33:57,354 --> 00:34:11,031
Everybody understands this? Ok, now
we come to the question whether all reactions

212
00:34:11,135 --> 00:34:19,937
 from homeopathic remedies, that means all aggravations, are curative reactions?

213
00:34:22,042 --> 00:34:37,375
So we know that we have a reaction
 from just proving a remedy.

214
00:34:43,844 --> 00:34:57,958
We have a reaction which is curative,
we have a reaction that can come from-

215
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:29,792
we said this we call the - similimum the best remedy, the correct remedy is called the similimum.

216
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:41,396
But things are so close to each other,
that many times we choose a remedy

217
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:52,333
which is similar, it's only similar.

218
00:35:59,823 --> 00:36:14,583
What do we mean by similar? We go back to
this and we see that the remedy we choose,

219
00:36:14,688 --> 00:36:21,510
did not have the modality of this fever,
 it has another modality.

220
00:36:26,469 --> 00:36:39,104
And it had the headache and it had the
microbe but this, the thirst was not there.

221
00:36:39,208 --> 00:36:48,802
Actually, it wants negative here. So this
graph is similar because it contains

222
00:36:48,906 --> 00:37:00,854
 that similar, that similar, that similar but
we do not know anything better

223
00:37:00,958 --> 00:37:10,677
and we give this remedy. Then we give
what we call a similar remedy,

224
00:37:10,781 --> 00:37:13,010
we have a different reaction.

225
00:37:13,115 --> 00:37:19,385
We shall be examining now the reactions
of the organism in each particular case

226
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:28,292
and make it very clear in our
understanding what exactly we mean.

227
00:37:29,292 --> 00:37:37,979
So this 4th point it can be what?
You have an aggravation,

228
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:44,885
the patient comes and says
'oh, I was much worse'.

229
00:37:45,667 --> 00:38:03,250
Because the patient is a hysterical
 patient. He does autosuggestion;

230
00:38:03,354 --> 00:38:08,979
he likes to have an aggravation because
 he has heard that it is good to have

231
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:19,958
an aggravation. In this category there is
 another case, hypochondriac.

232
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:30,479
The hypochondriac patients who
are both these categories,

233
00:38:30,583 --> 00:38:39,677
they will produce symptoms of their own,
that have nothing to do with your remedy,

234
00:38:39,781 --> 00:38:48,188
 they will tell you here, 'oh I have such a big reaction' and it is good that I had this reaction

235
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:54,604
and this hypochondriac person will tell you,
 'I had this reaction and I had that reaction,

236
00:38:54,708 --> 00:39:00,604
what's happening to me, am I going
 to die now? I have a little bit of

237
00:39:00,708 --> 00:39:20,500
this buzzing inside my head and this
buzzing or a little bit of dizziness'.

238
00:39:20,604 --> 00:39:26,448
It becomes almost a matter
of life and death for the patient.

239
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:34,938
And then you feel that your
remedy is not reacting at all.

240
00:39:35,042 --> 00:39:41,219
You have to be able to perceive
 these things.

241
00:39:41,708 --> 00:39:53,854
And then of course, we have a reaction
 from an organism when and if

242
00:39:53,958 --> 00:40:01,521
we start the treatment while the
patient is on allopathic drugs

243
00:40:01,625 --> 00:40:12,375
and we tell him stop these drugs and
take this remedy. Withdrawal of drugs.

244
00:40:16,729 --> 00:40:23,833
Withdrawal of drugs can produce a lot
 of symptoms that do not belong

245
00:40:23,938 --> 00:40:29,625
to any curative reaction.

246
00:40:30,771 --> 00:40:40,688
So these are the categories which
you have to be thinking about.

247
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,292
 The patient
comes and gives a reaction.

248
00:40:44,396 --> 00:40:51,406
You have to evaluate: is it proving, is it similar,
 is it hysterical, is it hypochondriac?

249
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:56,323
 Immediately you have to know.
If you are clear in this,

250
00:40:56,427 --> 00:41:01,917
then you can continue.
If you are not clear forget it.

251
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,365
The patient will tell you this
time one group of symptoms,

252
00:41:06,469 --> 00:41:12,656
another time that group of symptoms
and you will continue throwing remedies

253
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:17,042
 without knowing exactly what
is going on with the patient.

254
00:41:24,708 --> 00:41:33,365
So we go to the first category
 and we say provings.

255
00:41:33,469 --> 00:41:37,802
When do we have a proving
and not a cure?

256
00:41:38,354 --> 00:41:44,583
What will be the difference?
 In provings you will develop

257
00:41:44,688 --> 00:41:54,990
symptoms that you did not have before.
But I will tell you something.

258
00:41:55,094 --> 00:42:01,292
In a curative action, you may develop new symptoms that you did not have before also.

259
00:42:04,833 --> 00:42:08,812
How do you differentiate between
one time which is not curative

260
00:42:08,917 --> 00:42:13,865
and another time
which is curative?

261
00:42:17,208 --> 00:42:33,698
In the provings there is no amelioration.
You have new symptoms

262
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:43,604
which have nothing to do with
the symptoms of the patient and

263
00:42:43,708 --> 00:42:49,740
at the same time the patient says
'on my other symptoms I am the same'.

264
00:42:49,844 --> 00:42:58,396
There is no general
amelioration of the case.

265
00:43:03,875 --> 00:43:08,427
So in the provings what he will
 tell you exactly?

266
00:43:08,531 --> 00:43:27,385
You gave a dose of Nat-m 10 M.
You gave a dose of high potency,

267
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:32,667
what we call a high potency and the
patient comes and tells you,

268
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:41,563
'It's strange that I did not suffer any
headaches and now when I wake up

269
00:43:41,667 --> 00:43:52,667
in the morning I have some headache'.
What do you have to ask immediately after that?

270
00:43:54,729 --> 00:43:59,021
He says 'I did not
have the headaches before'.

271
00:43:59,125 --> 00:44:05,031
 Your first question immediately to
short out, there is a typical question

272
00:44:05,135 --> 00:44:12,875
 that you have immediately to ask:
how do you feel in general now?

273
00:44:12,979 --> 00:44:22,427
He came for his phobias, for his fears, for
his colitis, for his duodenal ulcer, whatever.

274
00:44:22,531 --> 00:44:28,833
How is your duodenal ulcer and pains?
'Oh, there are much better.'

275
00:44:28,937 --> 00:44:35,698
 But what about the headaches?
If the headaches are typical

276
00:44:35,802 --> 00:44:40,771
headaches of Nat-m which has
headaches on waking in the morning

277
00:44:40,875 --> 00:44:48,104
 or at 10 o'clock especially, this is typical,
he says every day at 10 o'clock starts

278
00:44:48,208 --> 00:44:56,719
 a headache and he says my duodenal
ulcer is better. These two information

279
00:44:56,823 --> 00:45:04,781
make absolutely sure that your remedy
 is correct. But if he says that

280
00:45:04,885 --> 00:45:12,229
 'I have the headaches but my duodenal
ulcer is the same or my other symptoms

281
00:45:12,333 --> 00:45:17,427
 are the same, no change'
this is a case of a proving.

282
00:45:17,531 --> 00:45:27,708
 That means you gave a remedy
which had an effect and he is a prover.

283
00:45:29,396 --> 00:45:34,521
So in a prover you don't have an
amelioration on the energy level,

284
00:45:34,625 --> 00:45:40,188
you don't have an amelioration
on local symptomatology

285
00:45:40,292 --> 00:45:46,865
and you have the appearance of new
symptoms that he did not have before.

286
00:45:51,219 --> 00:45:59,813
These things you have to know very
clearly and immediately.

287
00:45:59,917 --> 00:46:07,094
Otherwise my experience is that cases
 have been spoiled mostly because of

288
00:46:07,198 --> 00:46:20,229
 lack of this knowledge. 'Oh, it is a proving
 I must antidote' or different ideas

289
00:46:21,625 --> 00:46:32,813
but if the person is better generally, better
 in his ulcer, leave alone the headache

290
00:46:32,917 --> 00:46:38,917
 of the Nat-m because it's going
to go away very soon,

291
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:49,604
by itself without any further remedy.
If you enter with another remedy

292
00:46:49,708 --> 00:46:55,958
you are going to spoil your good
action of your remedy.

293
00:47:01,354 --> 00:47:08,938
And of course when you're dealing
with deep severe chronic cases,

294
00:47:09,042 --> 00:47:14,938
 things are not very clear.
But the general rules should be there,

295
00:47:15,042 --> 00:47:23,427
 the general rules should
be understood by you.

296
00:47:24,729 --> 00:47:41,865
The first thing you'll see is a feeling of
being better, I feel better, general.

297
00:47:48,177 --> 00:47:57,208
I have more headaches, I have more
pains etc. but I feel better generally

298
00:47:57,313 --> 00:48:16,667
it is and indication that your remedy
 is correct. Then, psychologically better,

299
00:48:19,469 --> 00:48:36,396
that means in mental - emotional better
then most probably your remedy is correct.

300
00:48:48,917 --> 00:49:17,813
Better in symptoms, better in the symptoms
 and either no change psychologically

301
00:49:17,917 --> 00:49:25,010
 or no change in general that means
general the same, psychologically

302
00:49:25,115 --> 00:49:35,625
 the same.....you see you have
 to be very precise.

303
00:49:36,625 --> 00:49:44,031
Here, somebody tells you 'my stomach
pains, my headaches,

304
00:49:44,135 --> 00:49:52,854
my physical symptoms are better but
 I have no change psychologically

305
00:49:52,958 --> 00:50:01,885
 and I have no change in general', is it better,
is it curative action or is it not?

306
00:50:08,604 --> 00:50:15,250
You see, immediately you have doubts.
Here we do not have doubts,

307
00:50:15,354 --> 00:50:18,938
we have to be very clear, ok?

308
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:31,583
If these symptoms are better and
 it is curative that means,

309
00:50:31,688 --> 00:50:39,031
that the general state and the
psychological state are quite well,

310
00:50:39,135 --> 00:50:44,875
quite balanced, did not need
a rearrangement. All the force

311
00:50:44,979 --> 00:50:53,292
of the disease was in physical level.
That physical level gets better

312
00:50:53,396 --> 00:50:59,469
 and then that's all that the
remedy should do.

313
00:51:00,156 --> 00:51:05,875
If you expect every time to say the
 patient is better psychologically

314
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:17,760
 and better generally, it is wrong,
as long as these states,

315
00:51:17,865 --> 00:51:24,667
 general states, psychological states
are in a good condition.

316
00:51:24,669 --> 00:51:41,427
If the symptoms are better but worse
here or worse there, that is another story.

317
00:51:52,552 --> 00:52:06,938
In curative action here, you
may have a proving symptom.

318
00:52:08,448 --> 00:52:18,760
That means, better generally, better in the symptoms but one or two proving

319
00:52:20,292 --> 00:52:32,094
 symptoms are appearing that shows
that the remedy is absolutely correct.

320
00:52:32,198 --> 00:52:39,813
It is a confirmation that your remedy
is correct if you have the proving

321
00:52:39,917 --> 00:52:46,958
 of one or two symptoms of the remedy.

322
00:52:47,708 --> 00:52:52,563
While the person is getting better
psychologically or better generally

323
00:52:52,667 --> 00:52:55,531
or better in the symptoms.

324
00:53:05,354 --> 00:53:12,833
So therefore you say, you give a remedy
 'ah I have a symptom, it's a proving'.

325
00:53:12,938 --> 00:53:18,167
No, no, no wait a moment.
'How do you feel psychologically?', 'Better'.

326
00:53:18,271 --> 00:53:21,323
 Generally, better and
you have a proving?

327
00:53:21,427 --> 00:53:34,448
That is a confirmation that the remedy
was correct, it's not a proving.

328
00:53:37,042 --> 00:53:53,490
Now you come here in this group where
we have most of the problems, why?

329
00:53:54,156 --> 00:54:08,563
Because the remedy we many times give, especially when we prescribe fast,

330
00:54:08,667 --> 00:54:17,198
when we give a similar
remedy which what it does?

331
00:54:22,375 --> 00:54:39,271
Here, in this group we have
1) change of symptoms,

332
00:54:42,375 --> 00:54:49,750
 2) no general amelioration,

333
00:54:51,760 --> 00:55:00,708
3) no mental amelioration.

334
00:55:16,802 --> 00:55:24,781
When I say change of symptoms what
do I mean? I mean that a headache

335
00:55:24,885 --> 00:55:33,271
has been changing to vertigo. You gave
a remedy because of chronic headaches

336
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:42,729
 and the headaches have been changed
to vertigo. The person says I feel dizzy.

337
00:55:43,531 --> 00:55:49,604
Yes you feel dizzy but are you better
generally? He says no.

338
00:55:49,708 --> 00:55:57,813
Are you better psychologically? No.
That means you gave a similar remedy

339
00:55:57,917 --> 00:56:01,583
 and you are going to change
symptom after symptom.

340
00:56:01,688 --> 00:56:12,010
Now, how you handle that we'll talk.
In hysterical and hypochondriac patients

341
00:56:12,115 --> 00:56:18,229
you have a reaction almost with every
remedy you give. You don't know if the

342
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:27,115
reaction is because of the remedy or
because of the make up of the person.

343
00:56:27,625 --> 00:56:35,781
In these cases, hysterical, you see that not always the symptoms belong to the remedy.

344
00:56:35,885 --> 00:56:44,375
These hysterical people can bring out a lot of other symptoms that do not belong to the remedy.

345
00:56:51,094 --> 00:56:58,896
And many times in group 6
 because you decided to give a remedy

346
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:05,010
under allopathic drugs you don't know
what are the symptoms underneath.

347
00:57:05,115 --> 00:57:11,396
So you withdraw the drugs and all
other symptoms start appearing.

348
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:17,344
You don't know whether they belong to
 the remedy or not to the remedy etc.

349
00:57:17,448 --> 00:57:23,958
  and that is why the best thing
to handle these cases is to stop

350
00:57:24,063 --> 00:57:33,604
the allopathic drugs at least for one month,
see the picture and start from that picture.

351
00:57:33,708 --> 00:57:41,188
If you start while the person is under
allopathic drugs, then you will have

352
00:57:41,292 --> 00:57:49,125
a problem in evaluating what is
happening under your remedy.

353
00:57:52,865 --> 00:58:10,979
So handling of provings. How you
handle a proving? What do you do?

354
00:58:14,021 --> 00:58:18,896
A proving is when you have new
symptoms, belonging to the remedy.

355
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,250
Characteristic symptoms of the remedy
without any change of the condition

356
00:58:25,333 --> 00:58:33,115
 of the person. That's a proving.
What do you do?

357
00:58:36,865 --> 00:58:46,990
Here you have to wait and the symptoms
of the remedy will subside within

358
00:58:47,094 --> 00:58:56,208
a period of time which is between
a few days to a few weeks, 5, 6 weeks.

359
00:58:59,688 --> 00:59:08,896
If you wait the symptoms will subside but
that means that the remedy you have given

360
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:15,427
is wrong and you have to search
 for another remedy.

361
00:59:15,531 --> 00:59:22,990
In such a case you can prescribe
 the next remedy even when

362
00:59:23,094 --> 00:59:29,698
  the symptoms
of the provings are still there.

363
00:59:29,802 --> 00:59:33,677
The organism does not care.
 If you give the next remedy

364
00:59:33,781 --> 00:59:38,625
which is the correct one, will react.

365
00:59:40,333 --> 00:59:48,438
So here, for the provings the best is to wait
until the symptoms of the provings go away.

366
00:59:48,542 --> 00:59:55,229
If the person is suffering a lot you cannot
wait. Then you can still go ahead

367
00:59:55,333 --> 00:59:59,938
and give the next remedy.

368
01:00:00,042 --> 01:00:10,813
Will you take in consideration the
symptoms of the proving together

369
01:00:10,917 --> 01:00:17,583
with his other symptoms?
No, in this case, no.

370
01:00:22,375 --> 01:00:29,031
You go back to the original case and
you study the original case only,

371
01:00:29,135 --> 01:00:31,479
not the proving symptoms.

372
01:00:31,583 --> 01:00:43,896
If you put together the proving
symptoms then you make a confusion.

373
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:49,438
- Can I make a contradiction and go to the
first remedy and then to the next,

374
01:00:49,542 --> 01:00:53,813
right remedy, is it possible?

375
01:00:53,917 --> 01:01:01,563
-To make a contradiction? Counteraction, antidote, you mean antidote?

376
01:01:03,792 --> 01:01:09,760
No. It's not necessary
to give an antidote.

377
01:01:13,135 --> 01:01:23,292
The best is going back to the case,
restudy and give the next, best remedy.

378
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:37,938
On the curative reaction, especially
when he says better generally

379
01:01:38,042 --> 01:01:48,729
 but the symptoms still are
there, what you do?

380
01:01:48,832 --> 01:01:51,656
-Wait.

381
01:01:51,760 --> 01:02:03,521
-Wait, better psychologically the physical symptoms are still there, wait.

382
01:02:03,625 --> 01:02:13,000
Don't interfere with another remedy.
 Please don't spoil a good prescription.

383
01:02:14,583 --> 01:02:22,063
You will see eventually that these
symptoms also subside,

384
01:02:22,167 --> 01:02:28,833
maybe they need time
3 weeks, 3 or 5 months.

385
01:02:28,938 --> 01:02:36,354
If you leave alone the organism,
the symptoms will subside.

386
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:51,271
If you have a proving here, will you do
 anything? No, leave it alone.

387
01:02:51,375 --> 01:03:00,813
 Once you make sure that the person is
better generally, better psychologically and

388
01:03:00,917 --> 01:03:08,917
   some provings are there, leave it alone, the proving symptoms will subside by themselves.

389
01:03:13,167 --> 01:03:16,792
- How long can we wait?

390
01:03:23,573 --> 01:03:34,563
- Three years. Bill Gray, you know
Bill Gray? Everyone knows him.

391
01:03:34,667 --> 01:03:39,292
He came here to study with me for
2 years. He stayed in Greece.

392
01:03:39,396 --> 01:03:44,813
One year he went back for one
month to see his cases

393
01:03:44,917 --> 01:03:50,406
and then he came
 back again for the second year.

394
01:03:50,510 --> 01:03:56,146
In the meantime he was treating some
of the cases through correspondence

395
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:58,813
and all the cases that
 he treated a year ago,

396
01:03:58,917 --> 01:04:05,938
when he came back to me he said,
 'I cannot believe it, all my cases

397
01:04:06,042 --> 01:04:15,406
are doing well. Why? Because I did not
 interfere, I was not there to interfere

398
01:04:15,510 --> 01:04:22,958
with the remedy all the time. What I was
 doing stupidly all the time before.

399
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:33,979
 I left them alone, he says I want to see you, much better, diabetes, chronic diseases, everyone'.

400
01:04:34,083 --> 01:04:41,990
He has given the right remedy many times
and he was doing this kind of things,

401
01:04:42,094 --> 01:04:47,280
oh now I have this pain, take this remedy.
Now I have that, take this, take that

402
01:04:47,384 --> 01:04:54,563
 and you spoil the case. You leave it
alone and you see.

403
01:04:54,667 --> 01:04:59,760
I mean there is placebo, you can
give placebo if you want,

404
01:04:59,865 --> 01:05:07,990
if the patient needs to take
something, you give placebo.

405
01:05:08,094 --> 01:05:16,146
But it is very important to know the rules
 here. If you don't know the rules,

406
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:20,406
the proving,
the similar, the withdrawal,

407
01:05:20,510 --> 01:05:30,094
if you are not clear in that how can
 you proceed? You have to be clear.

408
01:05:31,917 --> 01:05:40,479
The remedy is correct you leave it alone.
How long you leave it alone?

409
01:05:40,583 --> 01:05:46,021
I would say if the person feels better
generally, better psychologically

410
01:05:46,125 --> 01:05:57,500
, 6 or 9 months, wait.
 As long as it is a real information,

411
01:05:57,604 --> 01:06:08,052
 not the idea of, 'are you better
psychologically'? The patient thinks,

412
01:06:08,156 --> 01:06:14,625
'you are better, you are better,
oh you are better'.

413
01:06:17,979 --> 01:06:28,563
Not like this, this is dangerous. You are
 better,  I can see you are better.

414
01:06:28,667 --> 01:06:33,031
Many times
I can see if somebody is better.

415
01:06:33,135 --> 01:06:39,604
They enter the room and there is another
 air, you feel immediately the remedy.

416
01:06:39,708 --> 01:06:45,854
He says, how are you and you have
a problem there with the patient

417
01:06:45,958 --> 01:06:55,115
who wants everything to go in one month.
Then you have to pass judgement quickly.

418
01:06:55,219 --> 01:07:03,438
 I see he's better, how much he accepts,
what type of the person he is etc.

419
01:07:03,542 --> 01:07:11,375
This is what we have to learn through
taking the case and evaluating.

420
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:22,646
Because human beings are not simple
beings, they are complicated.

421
01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:29,698
They have a lot of back thinking, think in
one level and there is another level

422
01:07:29,802 --> 01:07:32,031
where he thinks something else.

423
01:07:32,135 --> 01:07:37,333
And perhaps some of them are thinking
 on 3 levels at the same time.

424
01:07:38,667 --> 01:07:46,365
One level tells you one thing, the second level says let's see how he reacts if I tell this thing

425
01:07:46,469 --> 01:07:53,656
 and the third level is criticising you
and says this, this and that.

426
01:07:53,760 --> 01:08:01,021
All these are happening together.
It's not so easy, we say better

427
01:08:01,125 --> 01:08:05,896
psychologically and generally better, yes.

428
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:17,719
These reactions you get from people
 living in the country, villagers, farmers,

429
01:08:17,823 --> 01:08:25,958
people who work with their bodies
a lot, have simple reactions.

430
01:08:26,062 --> 01:08:36,812
The more educated is a person, the more complicated he is in his reactions and

431
01:08:36,917 --> 01:08:47,865
 transactions and you have to be very
aware of how he gives you an information,

432
01:08:48,667 --> 01:08:56,229
what he says, who he is. A simple
 person, you say to him you are better,

433
01:08:56,333 --> 01:09:00,625
 you are better, he will say
yes I am better finally.

434
01:09:00,667 --> 01:09:10,208
An intellectual he will not accept this
 treatment, he will judge you,

435
01:09:10,312 --> 01:09:15,031
 he will leave you, he will say 'oh, you're
 stupid you are this or you are that'

436
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:22,187
 and he will go to somebody else.
But an intellectual can be better

437
01:09:22,292 --> 01:09:28,854
and not tell you I am better because
he's judging you all the time.

438
01:09:28,958 --> 01:09:35,323
He gives you one thing and he's
judging you on another level.

439
01:09:35,427 --> 01:09:40,344
Does he understand, how much he
understands etc. and you have to be

440
01:09:40,448 --> 01:09:45,885
aware of what you have in front of you.

441
01:09:47,490 --> 01:10:00,438
The evaluation of the reaction to homeopathic remedy is an art really of high order.

442
01:10:00,542 --> 01:10:11,625
Because you are judged by the gods how
much really you understand human nature,

443
01:10:11,729 --> 01:10:15,010
do you understand human nature?

444
01:10:15,115 --> 01:10:22,563
You say yes, I understand but who
understands human nature, nobody totally.

445
01:10:22,667 --> 01:10:29,604
 But as the experience comes, you see more
and more cases, you are able to perceive

446
01:10:29,708 --> 01:10:35,604
more and more what is happening in the
soul of a person, in the mind of a person

447
01:10:35,708 --> 01:10:46,583
who comes to you to be treated. Because
your desire is to cure him, you don't care

448
01:10:46,688 --> 01:10:49,917
about judgement and things like that,
 he judges me or he doesn't judge me.

449
01:10:50,021 --> 01:10:58,583
What you are concentrated
 upon is his health.

450
01:10:58,625 --> 01:11:10,187
So you have to be an objective observer,
 not conditioned, not prejudiced.

451
01:11:10,292 --> 01:11:14,188
Because if you are prejudiced when
he comes there  and he judges you

452
01:11:14,292 --> 01:11:27,167
 and you understand, you judge him back
and you say he's pissed, he's this, that.

453
01:11:28,333 --> 01:11:37,604
Forget about the cure, your ego comes
into the picture and then

454
01:11:37,708 --> 01:11:44,146
some other person comes and you say
 how nice, only good reactions

455
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:50,385
and you will have only your friends and
people who like you as patients.

456
01:11:50,490 --> 01:11:54,042
All the others will leave you.

457
01:11:58,823 --> 01:12:11,146
When you give a similar remedy you have
the most unfortunate thing happening,

458
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:17,603
 changing the symptoms of the case
without curing the patient.

459
01:12:18,583 --> 01:12:22,646
 And this is the most unfortunate
 that can happen.

460
01:12:22,750 --> 01:12:27,500
Unfortunately
 it happens frequently.

461
01:12:29,708 --> 01:12:40,010
You give a remedy and then the patient
comes and tells you 'my stomachache is better'

462
01:12:40,115 --> 01:12:44,427
 but he comes after 3 months,
 because he follows you.

463
01:12:44,531 --> 01:12:51,292
These cases will follow you
for 3 years, 5, 10 years.

464
01:12:51,396 --> 01:12:55,897
They are patients who will follow
you the rest of your life.

465
01:12:55,938 --> 01:13:08,937
Because they have found out that
something you can do but not the best

466
01:13:09,042 --> 01:13:16,427
and they follow you, they are good
patients, they support us financially

467
01:13:16,531 --> 01:13:21,938
 because if you cure everybody one time,
the whole planet in 1 year is finished.

468
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:39,229
No patients, I'm just joking. These patients
 here you have to know yourself,

469
01:13:39,333 --> 01:13:44,073
 you don't tell them.  Or you can
 tell them if you think they are

470
01:13:44,177 --> 01:13:50,188
 intelligent enough to understand, you say
I made a mistake and I just changed

471
01:13:50,292 --> 01:13:59,885
your symptoms without curing you.
And I have to search for another remedy.

472
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:06,521
Now here the situation is very difficult.
We'll talk a lot about the second prescription

473
01:14:06,625 --> 01:14:14,229
 in such cases, in detail, how to handle
 this because it's a very very serious

474
01:14:14,333 --> 01:14:21,135
  condition and it
 goes into a lot of details.

475
01:14:22,865 --> 01:14:28,406
In this case you'll find that certain of the symptoms of the initial symptoms

476
01:14:28,510 --> 01:14:36,188
 are going away or are going away on a big degree like 80% gone but some other

477
01:14:36,292 --> 01:14:44,052
symptoms are developing of the
 same order, of the same level.

478
01:14:44,156 --> 01:14:55,917
Sometimes by giving these remedies a lot, you may change level and go in a deeper level.

479
01:15:00,604 --> 01:15:07,354
Now, hysterical or hypochondriac patients
are those who will tell you with every

480
01:15:07,458 --> 01:15:14,896
remedy you give, that they have different symptoms that you cannot find in the provings.

481
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:23,292
They are symptoms of their own.
Which do not present symptoms

482
01:15:23,396 --> 01:15:33,344
 of a remedy. You gave Sepia and
you have developing some phobias

483
01:15:33,448 --> 01:15:41,177
fear of the dark, fear of this or that,
symptoms that do not belong to Sepia.

484
01:15:41,427 --> 01:15:50,146
You search for Sepia and you don't see
clear symptoms of Sepia but the patient

485
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:53,271
 is presenting a lot. Then you give
another remedy then they present

486
01:15:53,375 --> 01:15:59,729
other symptoms etc, etc. All the time,
every time you give a remedy

487
01:15:59,833 --> 01:16:11,479
 there is a new set of symptoms. It's better
 to wait with this patient to settle down

488
01:16:11,583 --> 01:16:19,854
and give very low potencies before you
can make head or tail in this case,

489
01:16:19,958 --> 01:16:23,063
before the case is clear.

490
01:16:31,917 --> 01:16:43,188
- But the word hypochondriac means that
it comes from a very deep place,

491
01:16:43,292 --> 01:16:47,542
so it means that it's coming
from a very genuine source.

492
01:16:47,646 --> 01:16:53,552
 So you may have to do something about
it even if it's called hypochondriac.

493
01:16:53,604 --> 01:17:02,521
- Oh yes, absolutely. I don't say you leave
them alone, you don't treat them.

494
01:17:02,625 --> 01:17:08,625
 I say better be careful not to give,
 with every symptom that they give you,

495
01:17:08,729 --> 01:17:17,854
 another remedy. You can wait for such
people for months to collect all

496
01:17:17,958 --> 01:17:24,813
the symptomatology they present
 and make an evaluation of the whole

497
01:17:24,917 --> 01:17:28,823
 of the symptomatology and
see the general picture.

498
01:17:29,042 --> 01:17:44,031
Then you see the hypochondriasis
and what is hypochondriasis?

499
01:17:44,135 --> 01:17:53,385
Usually it's about the health of the
person  and every symptom is exaggerated

500
01:17:53,490 --> 01:18:03,521
 and every time, I mean whatever,
some people look their (pulse) and say

501
01:18:03,625 --> 01:18:12,875
'I cannot find this' or they pick
up the telephone and tell you

502
01:18:12,885 --> 01:18:29,990
 'I think I have 78 pulse'. You say, 'don't worry
 it's ok, it's normal'. They say 'normal, 78?'.

503
01:18:30,094 --> 01:18:45,938
'Yes it's normal', you have to be certain.
'78 pulses are normal', they say 'oh 68',

504
01:18:46,042 --> 01:18:56,938
 '68 it's also normal. The normal pulse
 is from 68 to 78', you have to be sure.

505
01:18:57,042 --> 01:19:03,385
Then you wait, what you're doing behind
your mind you are searching if this is

506
01:19:03,490 --> 01:19:15,896
a case of Nit-ac. or Lyc. or Nat-m
or Kali-ars. The remedies with such kind

507
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:28,667
 of an anxiety which all the time say
 'oh, I have a little pain I think'.

508
01:19:36,292 --> 01:19:46,052
'Do you feel pain?', 'I think, I think'.
You do not go and say pain in the right

509
01:19:46,156 --> 01:19:56,896
hypochondrium and give Chelidonium, no.
You take the whole situation of the patient,

510
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:02,938
 it's different all together. The one who
 has pain in the right hypochondrium

511
01:20:16,938 --> 01:20:23,813
he says, you read his mind at this
moment, he says: 'shall I tell him or not.

512
01:20:23,917 --> 01:20:29,521
If I tell him that I feel a pain maybe he
will say it is cancer but if I don't tell him

513
01:20:29,625 --> 01:20:35,396
that I feel a pain that means that he will
forget about me. So what shall I tell?'

514
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:42,646
 That kind of thinking is going on
on a hypochondriasis state.

515
01:20:43,417 --> 01:20:48,771
 Then you don't take this pain and that pain
and that pain, you take the whole picture

516
01:20:48,875 --> 01:20:52,230
which says wait a moment.
With the blood pressure,

517
01:20:52,334 --> 01:20:58,875
 hypochondriacs who have blood
 pressure, forget it.

518
01:20:59,375 --> 01:21:03,917
Because the blood pressure normally goes
up and down all the time, in the morning,

519
01:21:04,021 --> 01:21:13,000
in the evening etc. and then when
they learn to put this 'I have 148'

520
01:21:13,104 --> 01:21:24,917
Yes but then you are 58 and 148
is normal. They say 'it's normal?'.

521
01:21:26,198 --> 01:21:33,854
So when you come to these cases you
have a lot of problems, stop giving remedies.

522
01:21:33,958 --> 01:21:39,521
 You gave 1 remedy, you gave 2 remedies,
 every time it was a big reaction

523
01:21:39,625 --> 01:21:50,031
you didn't know where you are.
Wait a moment, wait and observe now.

524
01:21:50,135 --> 01:21:52,833
Eventually the picture will develop.

525
01:21:52,937 --> 01:22:01,427
Is this Agar., is Nat-m., is Lyc., because
you think on another level in the case.

526
01:22:01,844 --> 01:22:11,479
They guide you to look upon little symptoms
 here and there when the main symptoms

527
01:22:11,583 --> 01:22:19,875
are on mental level and then
you have a problem.

528
01:22:19,979 --> 01:22:25,625
 Because you are describing these
little symptoms all around and

529
01:22:25,729 --> 01:22:30,312
you forget about the mental level.

530
01:22:32,646 --> 01:22:42,781
What do I do when I give a remedy
and the patient has severe aggravation,
which he cannot tolerate?

531
01:22:42,885 --> 01:22:56,938
We shall be talking about these cases and
if this case is very close to be incurable,

532
01:22:57,042 --> 01:23:01,479
most probably you will have to interfere
 with another remedy

533
01:23:01,583 --> 01:23:04,465
in order to upgrade this patient.

534
01:23:06,458 --> 01:23:11,510
Otherwise if you let him
 go like that, he will die.

535
01:23:12,542 --> 01:23:16,938
So in an aggravation, real aggravation
from the homeopathic remedy,

536
01:23:17,042 --> 01:23:27,115
 in the so called incurable case, it needs
an interference with the next remedy.

537
01:23:27,219 --> 01:23:32,531
 And usually the next remedy
appears, you can see.

538
01:23:45,292 --> 01:23:50,406
- With the hysterical, hypochondriac
cases isn't a symptom on itself

539
01:23:50,510 --> 01:23:52,438
when you look out  at the rubric?

540
01:23:52,542 --> 01:24:05,406
- Absolutely, you take in consideration
the anxiety hypochondriac as a rubric

541
01:24:05,510 --> 01:24:10,229
but this is not enough because
there you have 50 remedies.

542
01:24:10,333 --> 01:24:27,094
Which of the remedies.... a lot of remedies
 which you have to differentiate.

543
01:24:35,865 --> 01:24:45,229
Is it good to give placebo to such cases?
 Absolutely you give placebo 3 times the day,

544
01:24:45,333 --> 01:24:55,979
 you start with 1 time, you say double it,
3ple it, 10 times whatever satisfies their need

545
01:24:56,083 --> 01:25:12,135
and because these patients are usually
led by their minds and hypochondriasis,

546
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:20,917
to keep them in a low level  it is very
good for them and will make them

547
01:25:21,021 --> 01:25:28,270
 survive enough time for you to observe
what other symptoms are there

548
01:25:28,271 --> 01:25:36,833
so you make your correct decision. But have
in mind with these cases especially,

549
01:25:36,938 --> 01:25:44,563
that it is an element which will always
be there to a certain degree.

550
01:25:45,781 --> 01:25:58,698
It's like personality traits.
 So it will stay, but the exaggeration,

551
01:25:58,802 --> 01:26:03,771
the fears, the anxieties, the panic attack
which goes with such cases,

552
01:26:04,271 --> 01:26:14,646
 all this will go away. And in the back of their mind it will remain,  what about this pain?

553
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:24,031
But then just a thought and then it goes
away. Otherwise, the thought stays and

554
01:26:24,135 --> 01:26:34,375
tantalize them and makes them really
fearful, I'm going to die.

555
01:27:01,156 --> 01:27:13,292
Find in the Organon where Hahnemann talks about hysterical and hypochondriac patients.

556
01:27:56,250 --> 01:28:06,156
Where Hahnemann talks about this group,
 the similar, in the Organon?

557
01:28:18,750 --> 01:28:25,000
And which are the paragraphs in
which he talks about provings?
