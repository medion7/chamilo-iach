1
00:00:16,451 --> 00:00:30,312
I must say that this was a great surprise for me to see so many people coming from so far,

2
00:00:31,733 --> 00:00:47,893
like Brazil.  I got some information from your teacher. She told me you are using

3
00:00:48,236 --> 00:00:58,981
low potencies mostly. Who is using high potencies, from Brazil?

4
00:01:12,853 --> 00:01:21,333
Ok. I don't know what you have heard about my teaching.

5
00:01:21,508 --> 00:01:30,461
Most probably you hear that I am using high potencies. This is not true.

6
00:01:30,877 --> 00:01:39,165
I use from very low to very high potencies depending on the case.

7
00:01:43,421 --> 00:02:03,269
What I wanted to say as an introduction; I respect whatever helps a sick person

8
00:02:04,493 --> 00:02:19,717
to become better. Especially if the problem is chronic, deep and severe.

9
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:35,717
We have problems with such cases I don't know the general health state of Brazil

10
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:56,581
but I see the dancers and I consider them as very healthy population.

11
00:02:56,837 --> 00:03:19,533
When I see these people I say my God this is the acme of health! I also see from your response,

12
00:03:19,902 --> 00:03:35,837
you are not facing the problems that we face here is Europe and North America

13
00:03:38,453 --> 00:03:49,877
where the general population is so degenerated in its health.

14
00:03:51,333 --> 00:04:00,006
We have big problems treating these cases. You are lucky.

15
00:04:00,237 --> 00:04:12,933
If Homeopathy is spread all over Brazil you can keep the population in a very good

16
00:04:13,165 --> 00:04:28,485
state of health. Here in Europe we lost our chance and I will explain it to you.

17
00:04:32,429 --> 00:04:42,445
There are people who are treating with vitamins, minerals,

18
00:04:46,829 --> 00:05:10,197
herbs and all kinds of complementary therapies in health market. These products act

19
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:24,245
upon the physical body so if by chance somebody has a lack of a vitamin and you give

20
00:05:24,549 --> 00:05:38,150
the right vitamin he feels better. If by chance somebody has a lack of a mineral

21
00:05:38,774 --> 00:05:48,429
and you give this mineral he will feel better. So treating the physical body

22
00:05:49,741 --> 00:06:02,126
is the easiest way of treating people. If somebody has a tumor,

23
00:06:03,005 --> 00:06:15,421
removes the tumor and feels better. The problem is when the disease

24
00:06:15,829 --> 00:06:23,172
is more complicated and it's not so simple, it's not a lack of mineral or a lack of vitamin

25
00:06:23,573 --> 00:06:32,629
but is a much deeper problem where you have in autoimmune diseases,

26
00:06:33,205 --> 00:06:50,413
neuromuscular diseases, diseases that have been the effect of several generations

27
00:06:51,637 --> 00:06:59,700
that inherited them to the children and already had bad health.

28
00:07:09,557 --> 00:07:22,541
Actually when I came to Homeopathy in 1960, 54 years ago, I perceived that

29
00:07:22,837 --> 00:07:35,509
what was practiced was only with low potencies. When I investigated about the results

30
00:07:36,549 --> 00:07:44,293
I found out that there was some amelioration. I took this mixtures

31
00:07:44,485 --> 00:07:59,077
of 5 remedies and had an amelioration. I took this mineral and I had an amelioration.

32
00:07:59,477 --> 00:08:09,117
So the amelioration was there but the real cure was not.

33
00:08:09,293 --> 00:08:18,173
That means you were able to keep somebody on a certain level, tolerably well

34
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:31,877
but the actual problem was never eradicated. Do I speak slowly? It's ok.

35
00:08:43,069 --> 00:08:55,710
The kind of Homeopathy that gives 5 remedies in low potencies is easy

36
00:08:58,021 --> 00:09:10,813
because we have established that if somebody has headaches the best remedies for headaches

37
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:24,301
are these remedies and you give all of them . Sometimes first you give the first 10

38
00:09:24,661 --> 00:09:32,445
then the next 10 and so on… At some point the headache is going to be modified.

39
00:09:33,317 --> 00:09:47,541
This is the easy Homeopathy which I understand that it is necessary

40
00:09:48,901 --> 00:10:05,045
because the other way that means finding the similimum is taking so much time,

41
00:10:05,349 --> 00:10:16,685
so much investigation, so much effort and so much studying before you can give the remedy.

42
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:33,925
When you use these measures, low potencies, herbs and minerals you are treating

43
00:10:35,085 --> 00:10:48,285
the physical body, you are affecting the physical body mostly. But we don’t have

44
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:59,590
only physical bodies, we have also a part which is not physical but is psychological,

45
00:11:00,396 --> 00:11:18,973
emotional and mental. It is a psychosomatic medicine that we are dealing with

46
00:11:21,997 --> 00:11:37,733
and what I found out quite early was that if by chance or by study you have given

47
00:11:39,669 --> 00:11:52,453
the correct remedy there was a kind of rejuvenation, explosion of the organism,

48
00:11:52,901 --> 00:12:03,421
it was touching the immune system in its very deepest core and the immune system

49
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:12,772
was mobilized, there was an immediate reaction and after an initial aggravation

50
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:31,549
you had a fantastic effect. You have seen such cases where you don’t believe the effect

51
00:12:34,117 --> 00:12:48,021
of the correct homeopathic remedy. Here you have come to learn how you can find and apply

52
00:12:48,309 --> 00:13:17,318
the correct homeopathic remedy. This is the idea. Those who have learned this science

53
00:13:18,453 --> 00:13:28,509
they become so successful that then they can have anything they like but before you become

54
00:13:28,805 --> 00:13:51,541
successful you must be dedicated in studying and make this knowledge your way of life.

55
00:13:55,069 --> 00:14:11,021
Homeopathy is magical, very attractive because the moment that you have a patient

56
00:14:11,581 --> 00:14:23,253
in front of you who is suffering for years and you have attained the art and the science

57
00:14:23,525 --> 00:14:35,981
to bring back health to this person who has been suffering for 10-15 years, it's like a miracle!

58
00:14:36,485 --> 00:14:43,533
It's not a miracle, it's a matter of knowledge, of understanding what you are doing.

59
00:14:44,069 --> 00:15:00,421
With the other you can ameliorate. It's ok but if you learn how to do it it's a tremendous

60
00:15:00,565 --> 00:15:15,117
difference between amelioration and cure. It's a battle. But a beautiful battle.

61
00:15:16,453 --> 00:15:30,949
Something will give you back anything you can imagine. I've heard many times by many doctors

62
00:15:31,293 --> 00:15:47,437
that I am a bad guy because I prescribe one remedy only. They should kill me!

63
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:10,741
There have been lots of fights and aggression but I always say this is correct.

64
00:16:12,253 --> 00:16:21,509
If you like it you take it, if you don’t like it goodbye! Continue with what you want to do,

65
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:31,134
I will not accuse you. Why should you attack me all the time?

66
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:42,981
Later on I went to India in 1963 to different colleges where they were teaching Homeopathy.

67
00:16:43,557 --> 00:16:56,701
All were teaching pluralist Homeopathy, low potencies with mixtures of remedies.

68
00:16:59,525 --> 00:17:11,493
I went to different colleges to see if I could learn something. I went to America 1970,

69
00:17:12,221 --> 00:17:23,414
and I asked how many homeopaths were in the U.S. and there 3 M.Ds and 10 other people.

70
00:17:25,061 --> 00:17:39,957
Homeopathy was finished. Today there is a big movement and at this time 5 medical schools

71
00:17:41,013 --> 00:17:52,317
are adapting Homeopathy for their medical doctors and the numbers are increasing fast.

72
00:17:53,773 --> 00:18:09,573
How this came about… When I was teaching I told them that we should do something

73
00:18:11,861 --> 00:18:24,349
to promote Homeopathy and especially to the medical schools. And they told me I am crazy,

74
00:18:25,565 --> 00:18:35,293
medical schools would never accept your teaching. 25 years later…

75
00:18:35,492 --> 00:18:51,141
Of course I live long enough to do this. If I have ever used allopathic drugs

76
00:18:52,029 --> 00:18:56,532
I would be dead long time ago.

77
00:18:56,773 --> 00:19:09,141
But I never took allopathic drugs for anything. Not one time. Only when I was 16 years old

78
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:16,300
I took one dose of anti-inflammatory drug because I had severe pains in my back

79
00:19:19,189 --> 00:19:27,709
and my stomach was burning for 2 days. That was the last… one dose of anti-inflammatory drug

80
00:19:28,157 --> 00:19:50,204
at the age of 16, nothing more. What you are going to learn here is a little bit difficult.

81
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:18,998
I will try to show you with real cases, either live, there are some people

82
00:20:19,605 --> 00:20:27,716
who have asked me to take their cases so you will observe the taking of the case

83
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:47,429
but I have to tell you a few things of how I take the case. In medicine they teach you

84
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:56,565
how to recognize a case of bronchitis and differentiate it from a case of pneumonia,

85
00:20:59,813 --> 00:21:11,382
pharyngitis etc. how you can recognize a gastritis from a duodenal ulcer,

86
00:21:12,141 --> 00:21:20,605
how a spastic colitis is and what is the difference with ulcerative colitis.

87
00:21:21,165 --> 00:21:33,909
Once you establish this you give the remedy. The way that a homeopath takes a case,

88
00:21:36,197 --> 00:21:46,222
this information is a little part of what you need, the information concerning the pathology,

89
00:21:47,613 --> 00:21:59,093
the diagnosis. What you are interested in is the whole of the human being, how he behaves,

90
00:22:00,533 --> 00:22:15,573
how he behaves when he gets back home and he is tired and his wife starts telling him blah blah

91
00:22:19,277 --> 00:22:26,148
and then he explodes and cannot control himself and throws things…

92
00:22:28,669 --> 00:22:40,262
You realize that this man who has the gastritis is a case of Nux-v. It's not a case of Rob.

93
00:22:40,397 --> 00:22:55,837
which also has severe gastritis symptoms. And then a woman comes and says that

94
00:22:56,149 --> 00:23:06,021
before my menses I become a monster. Don’t let anybody talk to me 2 days before

95
00:23:06,173 --> 00:23:13,805
my menses come, I will kill anybody that comes in front of me…

96
00:23:18,525 --> 00:23:33,757
There is also chronic constipation. What type of constipation? With urging and no effect.

97
00:23:36,117 --> 00:23:49,925
Just this little information is very important because you know the Materia Medica.

98
00:23:52,045 --> 00:23:58,238
That is why you can differentiate between the one remedy and the other.

99
00:24:00,197 --> 00:24:10,373
Therefore when you take the case as the information comes in and the back of your mind

100
00:24:10,965 --> 00:24:16,573
there is information you have of the different pictures of Materia Medica

101
00:24:19,173 --> 00:24:25,597
so you always compare the information with what you know from the Materia Medica and then

102
00:24:26,692 --> 00:24:41,949
you differentiate and then the case goes towards Nux-v. because she is such a bitch.

103
00:24:44,726 --> 00:24:54,070
Do you understand the word 'bitch'? She did not translate properly!

104
00:24:56,397 --> 00:25:11,870
She makes modifications, I need the similimum! Exactly! Not modifications.

105
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:42,533
No low potencies! This woman says she is so irritated and irritable and speaks

106
00:25:42,861 --> 00:25:54,237
so badly to her husband and she has a constipation but the constipation

107
00:25:54,645 --> 00:26:06,220
is not like urging without effect because Nux-v. is a nervous remedy.

108
00:26:06,349 --> 00:26:14,708
The nervous system is on the edge. The whole nervous system is becoming irritated.

109
00:26:20,325 --> 00:26:31,781
Nux-v. has kept inside quite a lot of anger. Had a fight and she did not bring out all the anger

110
00:26:32,101 --> 00:26:45,550
that was inside her. She was controlling so the nervous system kept the anger and the irritation.

111
00:26:49,381 --> 00:27:00,622
This irritation appears on the peripheral nervous system as a spasm in the rectum.

112
00:27:01,309 --> 00:27:08,940
Gives the idea that it wants to have stool, goes to the toilet but no stool.

113
00:27:09,262 --> 00:27:16,973
Goes back and stool is not coming out, anger is not coming out.

114
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:31,029
This is the typical constipation of Nux-v. But you investigate the case and you see that

115
00:27:31,189 --> 00:27:48,037
she has constipation but no urging at all. Is there is no urging then you have to think twice

116
00:27:48,325 --> 00:27:57,725
before you go to Nux-v. So you investigate further some other remedies.

117
00:27:57,893 --> 00:28:14,278
Which are the other remedies? In order to find out that this woman is a religious person

118
00:28:15,613 --> 00:28:35,525
who is all the time under a state of irritation but also dissatisfaction on sexual level so she

119
00:28:35,885 --> 00:28:49,997
becomes irritable, bitchy, says bad words, fly into temper, go from one room to the other,

120
00:28:50,317 --> 00:29:01,622
shutting the doors, saying bad words to her husband and then you investigate about

121
00:29:02,021 --> 00:29:15,117
the sexual sphere. How is your sexual life? Not so good. Sometimes women talk more easily

122
00:29:15,381 --> 00:29:24,093
about their sexual life than men. When you ask a man about his sexual life usually says 'normal'.

123
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:33,085
All men 'normal'.

124
00:29:37,301 --> 00:29:51,869
Unless there is total incapacity of erection and has for this all the others 'normal'.

125
00:29:53,421 --> 00:30:00,965
But women talk because they are not so shy. I don’t know Brazilians.

126
00:30:01,525 --> 00:30:26,775
Maybe they are shyer. With the sexual freedom that has prevailed in our countries especially

127
00:30:27,538 --> 00:30:44,266
Europe, North America… Women have no problem talking about their sexual deviations.

128
00:30:44,722 --> 00:30:53,993
I remember teaching in Berkeley in California, the class was here and I was teaching

129
00:30:56,650 --> 00:31:07,403
about 20 meters away where I was taking the case and by TV students

130
00:31:07,698 --> 00:31:18,194
were listening and I remember a case of an American young girl, she was telling

131
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:31,970
such extreme things concerning her sexual life that the class of 20 meters away,

132
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:45,650
I could hear them laughing. I went to the class and I asked why are you laughing so loud?

133
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:56,739
They said because we felt that you were going to have a cultural shock with what

134
00:31:57,154 --> 00:32:07,266
you were listening. I said yes, I had a cultural shock with her telling all these things freely,

135
00:32:07,506 --> 00:32:23,914
without any shame. I am talking about 30 years ago, 1975.

136
00:32:24,834 --> 00:32:37,570
But still I could not believe the freedom. I don’t know if you have this kind of freedom in Brazil

137
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:51,539
but anyhow Brazilian race is a very loving one, with a lot of emotions.

138
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:19,410
If you have an emotional patient you have an easy case. If you have a person who

139
00:33:19,738 --> 00:33:32,506
is closed and emotions are burned out, forget it. You will battle to get some information.

140
00:33:32,923 --> 00:33:54,026
You will get 'yes', 'no'… But if you have an emotional person where his emotions are floating

141
00:33:56,586 --> 00:34:03,042
there is no problem. You will have easy cases for what we are going to teach you.

142
00:34:08,978 --> 00:34:23,346
What you will have to observe during the taking of the case, you will have to observe

143
00:34:23,714 --> 00:34:35,643
the question because the questions I put indicaed what I have in my mind as a possibility

144
00:34:35,963 --> 00:34:45,683
at the moment. Every question has a meaning and behind each question

145
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:54,075
there is a possibility of a remedy. Those who have the information,

146
00:34:54,443 --> 00:35:07,715
who have attended the full course of Homeopathy, they can follow and know

147
00:35:08,162 --> 00:35:14,617
George is now investigating the possibility of Plat. George is now investigating

148
00:35:15,147 --> 00:35:23,810
the possibility of Med. George is now investigating the possibility of Calc.

149
00:35:27,498 --> 00:35:33,761
Sometimes they don’t understand because the case goes to a very small remedy

150
00:35:38,658 --> 00:35:53,938
Paris quadrifolia. Who know Paris quadrifolia. You have to attend the classes

151
00:35:54,234 --> 00:36:05,475
to know Paris quadrifolia but the first time Paris quadrifolia appears in the class nobody knows,

152
00:36:05,667 --> 00:36:21,867
it's ok, but most of the cases are understood, followed by the students

153
00:36:22,475 --> 00:36:33,059
who have taken the full course. I'll tell you something to see how we are thinking

154
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:50,866
and how we are observing. In 1969 I was back in Greece and I had one student,

155
00:36:51,810 --> 00:37:07,178
a M.D. neurologist Irene and we were thinking how to promote Homeopathy

156
00:37:07,554 --> 00:37:18,714
in Greece together. She said she has a teacher in the University who I know quite well

157
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:28,963
so I will invite him in my home and you also come and by chance you will start talking.

158
00:37:29,202 --> 00:37:40,474
He was a Professor of Cardiology in the medical school. He comes and by chance we start talking

159
00:37:40,682 --> 00:37:55,810
about Homeopathy and he gets interested and in the end after 2 hours of discussion he says ok,

160
00:37:57,282 --> 00:38:10,570
I am a practical man so I have a coryza and I know it is going down tomorrow

161
00:38:10,826 --> 00:38:20,827
and then bronchitis comes. This is the usual course. Can you give me a remedy to stop my cold?

162
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:38,386
I said yes. Why? I had taken the full case while we were talking, 2 hours. First of all it was winter,

163
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:50,563
the house was a little bit cold but he stayed with his overcoat all the time.

164
00:38:57,354 --> 00:39:04,466
I was wearing my sweater and he was wearing his coat. Then from time to time

165
00:39:04,914 --> 00:39:21,618
he would get up from his chair and would sit in another chair etc. Then I noticed

166
00:39:22,666 --> 00:39:36,778
his nose was red because of the acid discharge. So without asking any question

167
00:39:40,146 --> 00:39:56,970
the remedy was Ars. Restlessness, cold feeling, acid discharge. You don’t need more than this.

168
00:39:57,314 --> 00:40:07,291
I said to Irene to give him 1 dose of Ars. 200C. He did not hear the remedy,

169
00:40:07,442 --> 00:40:21,842
because he would think that arsenic would kill him! He took it, greeted me and said goodbye.

170
00:40:24,466 --> 00:40:40,074
He had my telephone number. I told him because the coughing had started

171
00:40:42,891 --> 00:40:56,051
so he had some discharge and coughing, next day you have no cough but the discharge

172
00:40:56,178 --> 00:41:11,042
will be much more. Next day he phones me and says it’s professor X the discharge is more,

173
00:41:11,338 --> 00:41:28,791
no coughing and hangs up. Next day he phones, no discharge!

174
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:50,119
After that he called me and told about a case he had and he described me a case of severe acne

175
00:41:51,455 --> 00:42:10,847
with thick discharges, can you do anything for this. Give one dose of Calc-s. 200C.

176
00:42:18,646 --> 00:42:29,334
15-20 days later he calls me and says do you remember the girl with the severe acne?

177
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:43,007
Yes. I kissed her! What do you mean? Her skin is totally normal so I kissed her.

178
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:58,431
Of course he became my student later on. This is the type of effect you are going to have.

179
00:43:01,183 --> 00:43:14,231
This is how Homeopathy was spread all over the world because of the effect

180
00:43:14,623 --> 00:43:22,967
that this kind of Homeopathy has. There is easy Homeopathy, there is ghost Homeopathy,

181
00:43:24,262 --> 00:43:39,398
there are all kinds of Homeopathy. Some people say I found the cure for AIDS.

182
00:43:41,167 --> 00:43:56,126
What is it? I will send you a disc with a song and if you play the song for a month you are cured!

183
00:43:57,615 --> 00:44:07,239
You call it ' Homeopathy'? Yes because the vibrations of this song is telling

184
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:17,216
with the vibrations of AIDS and then similia similibus curentur.

185
00:44:17,798 --> 00:44:29,727
I said similia similibus you're crazy. Another says I will send you the remedy

186
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:42,119
through mobile phone. He sent some vibrations on the mobile phone,

187
00:44:42,495 --> 00:44:50,278
now you received your remedy. Another one says you don’t have to give the remedy

188
00:44:50,654 --> 00:45:02,511
you have a piece of paper, write Lyc. 10M. Take the water put it over it and then you drink it.

189
00:45:03,423 --> 00:45:09,870
And then you took Lyc. 10M. All this is called Homeopathy!

190
00:45:10,047 --> 00:45:19,879
Another one says you look like an animal. Which animal? Owl! Take owl!

191
00:45:23,558 --> 00:45:31,479
If the person looks like an animal you give an animal remedy.

192
00:45:31,894 --> 00:45:36,486
If he looks like a vegetable give him a vegetable.

193
00:45:36,735 --> 00:45:42,223
If he looks like mineral give mineral remedy.

194
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:49,935
I had a class here and I presented a case of asthma.

195
00:45:52,127 --> 00:46:02,817
A German man with big mustache, black hair. I asked the class if he looked like an animal,

196
00:46:03,129 --> 00:46:16,121
a vegetable or a mineral. ANIMAL! Now I will show you the remedy that cured.

197
00:46:16,489 --> 00:46:34,921
Put the video. This man was cured with Bell. What is this nonsense!

198
00:46:37,881 --> 00:46:47,217
Before where you are a lot of people have given you all kinds of ideas and nonsense.

199
00:46:49,785 --> 00:46:59,753
You don’t even have to make a proving! You just imagine what the proving could do!

200
00:47:05,049 --> 00:47:22,961
If I tell you I have a remedy which is a plant and it is called Agave.

201
00:47:24,097 --> 00:47:34,098
Please imagine what this remedy can do. Each one of you will imagine a different thing.

202
00:47:35,112 --> 00:47:48,169
Is this Homeopathy? I said to them this is not Homeopathy, this is your craziness.

203
00:47:50,873 --> 00:47:57,952
You are crazy but keep it for yourself. Don’t spread your craziness.

204
00:47:58,104 --> 00:48:11,272
If everybody becomes crazy, then we have a problem. This doctor came here and said

205
00:48:11,568 --> 00:48:18,592
I would like your blessing. I said you are crazy, you want me to bless you,

206
00:48:19,273 --> 00:48:32,673
so you are spreading your craziness! Are you serious? I am sorry but you tell the people

207
00:48:33,073 --> 00:48:44,665
that you are telling lies. You confess your sins. Tell everyone I was bluffing, I was telling stories.

208
00:49:02,369 --> 00:49:10,000
I hear a voice from a man but I look there but all girls are there. How is it possible?

209
00:49:11,585 --> 00:49:39,793
Is there a man? There is a man! Know I solved the problem. Blind. But does not talk, he is quite.

210
00:49:41,984 --> 00:49:59,200
The other talks who is behind. I could not believe who is this woman who talks like this?

211
00:50:03,689 --> 00:50:20,921
Go back to the way I take the case. Usually they teach you that you have to let the patient talk

212
00:50:22,473 --> 00:50:34,696
and tell you everything. I don't let the patient talk and tell me everything.

213
00:50:36,793 --> 00:50:45,969
I interrupt them and I ask questions and I told you why I ask questions.

214
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:58,785
I get 4 symptoms and I form an idea about the remedy and this is considered

215
00:50:58,945 --> 00:51:13,385
as a bad way of taking the case. Because you may miss some information that the patient

216
00:51:13,873 --> 00:51:25,705
would have given you in case you did not interrupt. That is true. But I have to take a case

217
00:51:26,248 --> 00:51:36,145
within a certain period of time and I have to come here from the case taking room

218
00:51:38,201 --> 00:51:43,120
and make the analysis and explain to you what I put these questions,

219
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:48,912
what is the remedy and support this idea for the remedy etc.

220
00:51:49,289 --> 00:52:07,809
Therefore I do not have unlimited time. Sometimes you will be angry because

221
00:52:08,089 --> 00:52:19,177
you don’t follow the process and sometimes you will shout.

222
00:52:19,896 --> 00:52:33,649
I remember a case I was taking inside. It was a woman, a medical person, she had problems

223
00:52:34,168 --> 00:52:43,889
with her mother, great conflict so she started talking about her mother.

224
00:52:45,401 --> 00:53:01,417
I went to our  country house and there was my mother, and she did not greet me etc.

225
00:53:02,185 --> 00:53:14,201
I let her talk for a while, I understood there was a big conflict. I put some questions,

226
00:53:14,392 --> 00:53:18,240
she did not pay attention, she continued telling the story.

227
00:53:20,585 --> 00:53:28,048
I said please I will ask questions and you will answer only the question.

228
00:53:28,616 --> 00:53:45,480
I was very abrupt. She stopped and asked questions. Then I came inside.

229
00:53:46,952 --> 00:54:00,160
That was a german group. I started analyzing the case and one German woman gets up

230
00:54:01,088 --> 00:54:09,025
and she says to me George, I don’t understand you, you are so patient in other times

231
00:54:09,545 --> 00:54:21,489
and now you spoke so badly to that poor woman… Then another one gets up and says

232
00:54:21,912 --> 00:54:38,408
I also agree with her. I said you take Causticum and you take Causticum.

233
00:54:38,712 --> 00:54:50,273
And the lady here also needs Causticum. So Causticum 50M. They were surprised.

234
00:54:52,625 --> 00:55:00,600
The woman says I cannot take 50M! If you don’t like 50M take whatever you like.

235
00:55:02,769 --> 00:55:11,562
6 months later the group comes back and she said she is better in everything.

236
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:26,225
Did you take Causticum? Causticum is a remedy that cannot tolerate injustice.

237
00:55:26,425 --> 00:55:35,969
They felt I was treating her with unjustice. They felt they had to get up and they

238
00:55:36,273 --> 00:55:46,265
respected me anyway. I feel my students must be free to tell whatever they like,

239
00:55:46,720 --> 00:56:01,449
otherwise it would be like suppressing them. They cannot withstand to keep inside the anger

240
00:56:01,904 --> 00:56:07,712
when some injustice is seen. The Causticum will get up and speak.

241
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:14,861
Once, there was a woman, she was quite short, and asked why would you do if you saw

242
00:56:15,077 --> 00:56:25,710
injustice especially towards animals. Causticum has a sensitivity to people

243
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:38,982
treating animals badly. She said I once attacked a huge man because he was treating

244
00:56:39,294 --> 00:56:55,566
his dog badly. Causticum is of that type. Therefore what we are interested in taking the case;

245
00:56:57,782 --> 00:57:10,030
we're to know the psychology, the mental/ emotional picture together with the pathology.

246
00:57:10,557 --> 00:57:19,486
Not only the pathology. But what about the whole person, how he behaves emotionally.

247
00:57:32,478 --> 00:57:50,174
Do you know when you are going to be attentive to what I say? When you are emotionally open.

248
00:57:50,574 --> 00:57:56,998
And when I put emotions in my sayings.

249
00:57:57,502 --> 00:58:13,830
Then it becomes alive. Who can stay 1,5 hour alive and not go like this?

250
00:58:14,942 --> 00:58:30,174
It's not possible unless there is emotionality in speaking. In order to communicate,

251
00:58:30,438 --> 00:58:41,101
we don’t communicate with ideas, we communicate with emotion and then the idea comes.

252
00:58:43,302 --> 00:58:58,707
If I give you ideas you may attend half an hour 35,36,37 minutes…

253
00:59:20,448 --> 00:59:33,192
Terrible! The moment the teacher is tired, that means there is no emotional energy

254
00:59:34,064 --> 00:59:54,432
the class is down. Usually the cases that I see are the most difficult.

255
00:59:56,080 --> 01:00:04,665
Because they come from very far to the island to be treated. They are desperate.

256
01:00:05,177 --> 01:00:12,793
These cases are not going to be cured with one remedy.

257
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:25,320
These cases have different layers of remedies that the homeopath has to recognize

258
01:00:25,528 --> 01:00:37,753
which is the right one first, the right one second…then you may have the effect.

259
01:00:48,704 --> 01:00:56,792
For you maybe it is not so difficult because you don’t have so many deep chronic conditions,

260
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:06,376
I don’t know. As I said I'm looking at the girls that dance… And I get an impression

261
01:01:08,696 --> 01:01:28,128
girls are very healthy. Too healthy. Therefore you will have the experience of taking a case

262
01:01:30,248 --> 01:01:39,544
I must also say that somebody wrote me about his case and I refused.

263
01:01:40,104 --> 01:01:45,264
I said don't let this case come,

264
01:01:45,384 --> 01:01:57,864
I cannot promise that this case will be cured but since he came I will take his case. Thank you!
