1
00:00:19,542 --> 00:00:29,115
I said according to my experience
at the most you can jump one level.

2
00:00:29,219 --> 00:00:38,115
And you can stay in the highest part of
that level with good homeopathic treatment.

3
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:54,781
What I wanted to say is that when you treat
here the pneumonia you go back there,

4
00:00:54,885 --> 00:00:58,802
then another remedy and you go back there.

5
00:00:58,906 --> 00:01:13,229
Then another remedy or 2 or 3 to treat the pneumonia then it jumps there, back,

6
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:19,521
then 2 remedies to jump there and
2 remedies to jump at higher level.

7
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:28,958
That whole process it may
need from 1 to 5 years.

8
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:44,510
-Is this also possible only with
one remedy, this treatment?

9
00:01:44,823 --> 00:01:51,083
-Level E, no.
If you are on level E, no.

10
00:02:21,198 --> 00:02:28,573
You have these levels, it's only indicative.

11
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:49,219
Here in this level, people are living 90 years
old and higher, born to live more 90 years old.

12
00:02:51,552 --> 00:03:02,365
 Here in this level born to live more than 80 years, here more than 75 years and

13
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:17,333
 then it goes down 65, 60, 50.

14
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:49,625
I'm just giving you some indications,
 here 40, 30, 20, 10, 5.

15
00:03:52,750 --> 00:04:00,708
So each one is born with a possibility
 to live certain years.

16
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:10,646
That means this one here is born
with a predisposition that his heart

17
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,708
will last up to 60 years of age.

18
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:22,219
When he reaches that age then
 he has a heart attack and he dies.

19
00:04:26,906 --> 00:04:37,375
What you can do is jump him up to
level 75, by treating him.

20
00:04:46,771 --> 00:05:02,354
Here we have one miasm,
therefore one remedy.

21
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:12,583
In this level with one remedy
you have beautiful cures.

22
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:27,271
You find this man who is going to live to 90,
at the age of 65 he comes down with lumbago

23
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:35,490
 and you give one remedy Calcarea
carbonica, everything is gone.

24
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:47,896
He is having a cold, a beautiful picture of Bryonia, you give it, everything is gone.

25
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,031
They go like this. Their organism is so strong
that produces a very clear picture

26
00:05:55,135 --> 00:06:02,583
of a remedy each time.
And usually it is one remedy.

27
00:06:02,688 --> 00:06:12,563
 This person actually can happen, that with
one remedy you can cure everything,

28
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:22,958
 the lumbago, the cystitis,
the pneumonia, whatever.

29
00:06:28,802 --> 00:06:45,604
Now as you go more and more down, you start complicating, 2 miasms, perhaps 2 remedies.

30
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:56,375
You go here you have 3 miasms.
From 3-6 remedies.

31
00:06:57,531 --> 00:07:07,802
 You go here you have 4-5 miasms,
 7-10 remedies.

32
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:23,917
You go down here you need a lot of remedies, you will be changing remedies very frequently.

33
00:07:26,823 --> 00:07:33,031
Here you have very seriously ill people,
 from the very young age

34
00:07:33,135 --> 00:07:55,865
and you're going to need the drugs
intermingled and you will need 20 remedies.

35
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:10,292
20 remedies in order to bring
this child up in the scale of life.

36
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:28,073
As you go along this from here,
people who are in this level here,

37
00:08:28,177 --> 00:08:37,021
they can jump a level higher much
more than people who are here.

38
00:08:37,802 --> 00:08:47,542
You get a person who is going to live 75,
in this level, and the most you can do

39
00:08:47,646 --> 00:08:55,188
 is to reach him up to 80 or
he's 65, he goes up to 75.

40
00:08:55,292 --> 00:09:00,823
But you get a person who is here
and if you treat him correctly,

41
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:09,333
you may make him jump
more than one level.

42
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:19,104
So this is a model that gives you
an idea of  what you are going to face

43
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:25,104
 when you have a certain pathological
case which is quite serious.

44
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:40,073
So in this case, in a serious pathological case, you will have a mixture of all kinds of remedies.

45
00:09:40,177 --> 00:09:46,313
These 20 remedies we're talking, we're
talking about different levels of remedies.

46
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:57,521
So which one you will choose? These are confused cases, you don't know where to start.

47
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:05,979
You take the case and either there is
very little symptomatology or

48
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:13,802
too much symptomatology,
which indicates a lot of remedies.

49
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:21,281
You take 2 symptoms, you need 1 remedy, another 2 symptoms, another remedy etc.

50
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:32,115
If you start correctly and then the second
 and third remedy is correct,

51
00:10:32,219 --> 00:10:38,823
then this case starts to be
 clear more and more.

52
00:10:40,646 --> 00:10:46,771
As you prescribe correctly they come
 to these levels where you need

53
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:51,229
another 4-5 remedies before
you can bring him up

54
00:10:51,333 --> 00:11:00,156
and then you can bring
him back to 30 years old.

55
00:11:07,469 --> 00:11:15,885
There is another disease which is
called thalassemia, a severe anemia.

56
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:32,333
Do you know this disease?
How many types of this disease exist?

57
00:11:32,844 --> 00:11:35,667
-Two types.

58
00:11:35,771 --> 00:11:44,896
-Two types, minor and major. If we are
dealing with the major thalassemia

59
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:52,042
we'll see very early in life, the blood
is gone they need transfusion.

60
00:11:56,927 --> 00:12:02,417
In the age of 2-3 years old, they start
 having blood transfusions.

61
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:08,292
These cases have very bad prognosis.

62
00:12:08,396 --> 00:12:19,844
Now you treat these cases, these people die between 10-12 seldom they live up to 18.

63
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:27,375
So you treat such a case and they
may live up to 40.

64
00:12:28,927 --> 00:12:39,083
But you will never reach, a case like this,
 the age of 70 or 75.

65
00:12:40,823 --> 00:12:55,271
In this model it says also, that people
having a state of health in these levels,

66
00:12:55,375 --> 00:13:01,271
can have a very high
potency without problem.

67
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:13,208
As you go down the ladder, the potency which you have to use is smaller and smaller.

68
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:30,719
So when you reach actually these bottom cases you can use only low potencies repeatedly.

69
00:13:30,823 --> 00:13:45,604
Here you can use potencies like 6X up to
12 X and then you will have to repeat every day,

70
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:52,385
 3-4 times the day, for a period of time
until you see some reactions and then you

71
00:13:52,490 --> 00:14:00,625
 have a new case or whether the
disease is not progressing anymore

72
00:14:00,729 --> 00:14:10,208
you raise the potency from 6 to 7
and then to 8 and 9X.

73
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:23,219
The same idea is with LM potencies.
 They are acting mildly.

74
00:14:26,844 --> 00:14:32,917
So you can be using Q potencies,
some people use Q potencies

75
00:14:33,021 --> 00:14:40,802
in everything here and
there is some effect also.

76
00:14:40,906 --> 00:14:51,708
If you use 6X potency to these people here,
 there is going to be an effect definitely

77
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:56,052
but in a much longer period.

78
00:14:56,156 --> 00:15:03,156
That means here in these cases the
effect will be within 1-2 days.

79
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:17,260
If you use 6X, it will take 20 days. That's the difference but some action should be there.

80
00:15:25,552 --> 00:15:32,448
I make it not very clear with the age
 because we do not have enough

81
00:15:32,552 --> 00:15:40,427
information at the moment to determine
exactly the levels and each level

82
00:15:40,531 --> 00:15:50,042
how many years is going to last.
This is not possible at the moment.

83
00:15:50,979 --> 00:15:58,938
If you are interested in going into such
 research, I may tell you a model

84
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:04,021
out of which  you can do the research.

85
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:21,063
Apart from the general check up
of the boy,  which will show that this a case

86
00:16:21,167 --> 00:16:28,594
 of epidermolysis bullosa or it's a
case of thalassemia major

87
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:35,292
where you have a serious problem,
apart from this you have the diagnosis.

88
00:16:35,396 --> 00:16:43,094
There are other parameters which can be measured to show that a boy with thalassemia

89
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:52,823
major, may live up to the age of 20, 22
and another one will die at the age of 10.

90
00:16:53,865 --> 00:16:58,271
 These parameters we don't
know at this moment.

91
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:12,844
But I believe we have parameters to
measure and be able to establish a reaction.

92
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:20,917
So for instance, a boy with thalassemia, measuring his mental-emotional

93
00:17:21,021 --> 00:17:30,917
reaction, giving tests to this boy to
determine the mental-emotional state.

94
00:17:31,021 --> 00:17:40,823
It will be determining whether
that boy will live longer.

95
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:50,281
If the boy seems to be healthy in these
levels, you will get the highest possible.

96
00:17:51,042 --> 00:17:59,667
If these levels are affected they are
lowering down the possibilities of life.

97
00:18:08,844 --> 00:18:17,188
The hereditary factors have to be measured, whether the parents had the same

98
00:18:17,292 --> 00:18:29,260
or similar diseases. Then the voice
 has to be determined,

99
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:37,021
 what kind of voice when the child cries,
how he cries, how frequently he cries.

100
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:45,229
Then the level of communication with the
outside world. When he walks, at what age?

101
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:54,604
When the teeth are appearing, all these
 have to go into a computer and eventually

102
00:18:54,708 --> 00:19:00,448
to have enough parameters to
say that a person who is born,

103
00:19:00,802 --> 00:19:10,031
 within 3-4 years, we can determine what is his predisposition and how long, more or less,

104
00:19:10,135 --> 00:19:19,510
this person is going to live.
Genetic information now, which is coming,

105
00:19:19,615 --> 00:19:27,365
 is proving all these theoretical conditions
 that we have been talking about.

106
00:19:27,469 --> 00:19:38,365
Genetic predisposition tells us that a person
 is predisposed to multiple sclerosis or

107
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:49,021
to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
or psoriasis, serious diseases.

108
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:59,938
 So we have enough measures at this
moment, that if we put them together,

109
00:20:00,042 --> 00:20:09,292
we can have an idea of how long that person
is going to live under normal conditions.

110
00:20:12,104 --> 00:20:20,250
Then what happens is that we determine that
this person is going to live up to the age

111
00:20:20,354 --> 00:20:31,229
of 75 and this person gets sick
and gets the wrong treatment.

112
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:36,938
He has some complications and he
has another wrong treatment etc.

113
00:20:37,042 --> 00:20:44,469
Then what happens is that we find
at the age of 40, this person

114
00:20:44,573 --> 00:20:51,979
who is going to live at 75,
almost dying.

115
00:20:52,083 --> 00:21:04,437
We find him at this age but the possibility is 75. So what happens is that treating this person,

116
00:21:04,542 --> 00:21:14,688
jumps one level after  another very fast,
because he was born with the possibility is 75.

117
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:21,083
This person will never go to the next of course.
Because you'll treat him and reach him up to 75.

118
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:33,781
But this is a great feat that we can
accomplish with Homeopathy.

119
00:21:33,885 --> 00:21:40,563
So wrong treatment will bring him down
and wrong way of life will bring down

120
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:47,427
your possibilities and correct treatment
will bring them back.

121
00:21:47,531 --> 00:21:53,719
This is not theoretical, it comes again
 from experience, what we have seen.

122
00:21:53,823 --> 00:22:01,583
We have seen people who have abused themselves through drugs,

123
00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:09,313
through wrong living, drinking, god knows.

124
00:22:09,417 --> 00:22:29,312
Yesterday I heard on the TV that N.Ceausescu, the son of the dictator in Romania,

125
00:22:29,552 --> 00:22:50,927
died from liver cirrhosis at the age of
40 from internal hemorrhage.

126
00:22:51,688 --> 00:23:08,896
But if I see his parents living to the age,
they intended to live up to 90 of course,

127
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:19,115
if they allow them, that means his
predisposition was at least for that age.

128
00:23:19,219 --> 00:23:32,729
Wrong way of living, he was a playboy,
drinking a lot, taking the wrong medicines,

129
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:36,750
he brought his possibilities to 40.

130
00:23:37,531 --> 00:23:48,896
Now let us say this man with this
predisposition, he comes to me, 2 years ago.

131
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Within 5 or 6 years of treatment,
I will bring him up to the age of 75.

132
00:24:03,802 --> 00:24:23,719
The way of life is very important. When I took
 up the case of Krishnamurti, in 1965 in India,

133
00:24:23,823 --> 00:24:32,313
he gave me his case and told me that
all his family died under the age of 50.

134
00:24:36,063 --> 00:24:45,000
Mother, father, brother died under the age of 50. His brother died at 40 with Tuberculosis.

135
00:24:45,104 --> 00:24:54,115
Parents died also because of infections.
Him, having a very good way of life,

136
00:24:54,219 --> 00:25:12,510
very much protected like a king with his
court, very protected and when I met him

137
00:25:14,823 --> 00:25:20,021
he was in a terrible state of health, why?

138
00:25:23,375 --> 00:25:41,979
When I met him in 1963 he was
72 but in a terrible state, very weak.

139
00:25:46,573 --> 00:25:54,521
That means he was going to
live another year or two.

140
00:25:54,625 --> 00:25:58,979
He was taking allopathic drugs
for the last 10 years.

141
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:08,094
He had been to the best Homeopaths before;
he said, nobody could ever help me.

142
00:26:08,198 --> 00:26:18,000
When I looked at him, he was looking so old
that I felt... I was going to his lectures before,

143
00:26:18,104 --> 00:26:25,292
I was not even looking, I was looking
at the trees outside, he was so old.

144
00:26:27,042 --> 00:26:37,688
I never asked an interview with him because
 I always ask for interviews with people;

145
00:26:37,792 --> 00:26:44,740
he was so old, he is going to die.
This is what I calculated.

146
00:26:44,844 --> 00:26:52,313
In about 3-4 months I received a message
while I was in India, studying there,

147
00:26:52,417 --> 00:26:57,667
whether I would go and see him to treat him.

148
00:26:57,771 --> 00:27:03,083
I was a student in one of the
colleges there, very strange eh?

149
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:18,000
They came to take me to see him and he was
in a terrible condition. I started treating him.

150
00:27:19,135 --> 00:27:23,385
I stopped the allopathic medicine,
I gave him the first remedy.

151
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:28,625
He reacted very strongly because he
was suffering chronic bronchitis.

152
00:27:32,469 --> 00:27:41,781
He was exhausted. I said it's ok,
then the 2nd remedy, the 3rd, the 5th.

153
00:27:41,885 --> 00:27:48,979
After one and a half year of treatment,
 I was with him almost every day.

154
00:27:49,083 --> 00:27:59,406
I became the physician of the court.
Every day I went to see him,

155
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:05,740
I prescribed for him very carefully.
In one and a half year he said to me,

156
00:28:05,844 --> 00:28:15,052
sir I feel like 16 years old.
I said, very good.

157
00:28:15,156 --> 00:28:21,854
Now this man who had, according to my understanding, only a few months to live,

158
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:42,646
he died in 1986 at the age of 95
without any further treatment.

159
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:51,156
After I left he had another homeopath
who gave him salts.

160
00:28:51,260 --> 00:29:02,365
You know the 12 Schuessler's salts of course
he was doing yoga, exercises and all that.

161
00:29:02,469 --> 00:29:17,625
He died at the age of 95, so these things work. This is a public information which I say.

162
00:29:17,729 --> 00:29:28,563
Everybody knows at that time that I was treating Krishnamurti and the difference when I left.

163
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:39,469
He had forbidden anybody to
take a picture at 1963.

164
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:48,979
He did not want to leave his
pictures for posterity like this.

165
00:29:49,083 --> 00:30:02,354
The gorillas would take your camera and say,
sit there, listen, then take your camera and go.

166
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:11,271
Years later, he has pictures which
 look beautiful, in 1970, 1975.

167
00:30:19,354 --> 00:30:26,313
So what I say is not theoretical
and comes out of imagination.

168
00:30:26,417 --> 00:30:32,573
They are facts which I have
seen again and again.

169
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:58,521
You will get some teachers, they will say, especially one from Argentina, who says,

170
00:30:58,625 --> 00:31:05,271
well you always have to find
one remedy, the core remedy.

171
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:13,885
 That remedy is for the whole life of the person. Nat-m, you give for the rest of the life.

172
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:32,271
What they do not know is that we have
this kind of degrees of health and

173
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:38,896
they were talking about these
people here which it may be true

174
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,229
but only for those very uppermost
 kind of people.

175
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:53,510
For those only who represent perhaps 5%
 on the planet, not more than that.

176
00:31:53,552 --> 00:32:07,938
At this day, even less. 30 years ago that
was 7%. Now it is going down and suddenly

177
00:32:08,042 --> 00:32:15,865
also you will see this is going
down more and more.

178
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:25,521
-I think you are speaking about Mazi.
He says that he finds such cases

179
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:44,667
only 3% or something like this. 3% or 5%
I don't know but it's not so much.

180
00:32:44,771 --> 00:32:52,188
-But to go and teach and say to the students,
well in every case you have to find

181
00:32:52,292 --> 00:32:58,938
the one remedy, is a wrong teaching.
You give a wrong impression to the students

182
00:32:59,042 --> 00:33:03,406
 who think all the time, 'oh I did not find
the right remedy', he feels 'oh I did not

183
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:08,729
find the right remedy if I gave
Sulphur and then Aconitum'.

184
00:33:08,885 --> 00:33:14,625
No. This is the wrong way of teaching
 coming from wrong observation.

185
00:33:14,729 --> 00:33:22,823
His observation is correct as far as this is concerned. Now we come to your question.

186
00:33:23,594 --> 00:33:30,031
-People are getting older and older, the difference is that they have not all

187
00:33:30,135 --> 00:33:37,458
good quality of life. It means they are
older and older and sicker and sicker.

188
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:48,875
-These are two different issues. What I'm
talking here is about a percentage of people,

189
00:33:48,979 --> 00:33:57,688
who are destined to have only one
remedy which is going to help them.

190
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:07,854
This does not concern the general population.
 I would say the general population is only 3%?

191
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:17,479
What I say is, out of the cases that we
see, these cases represent at the most 5%.

192
00:34:19,135 --> 00:34:26,333
 It's a different issue. The issue whether we
 live today more or less is another issue,

193
00:34:26,437 --> 00:34:29,802
we can discuss it but not at this moment.

194
00:34:29,906 --> 00:34:41,583
I have my doubts, I have seen statistics
and I know things are not like that.

195
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:49,052
Mortality in children has dropped
dramatically from old times and it shows

196
00:34:49,156 --> 00:34:55,854
on the general graphs that the
population is going up, living longer.

197
00:34:55,958 --> 00:35:03,406
Actually the children are not dying as fast as
they used to die with epidemic diseases.

198
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:10,229
Therefore the general graph maybe
coming up, but still it's not coming up,

199
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:14,208
it's staying on the same level,
inspite of the fact...

200
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:23,938
That means that for instance in Greece
we had the highest life expectancy

201
00:35:24,042 --> 00:35:30,958
from all Europe, up to 1970. Statistics
showed that Greek people

202
00:35:31,063 --> 00:35:36,375
used to live longer than
any other European country.

203
00:35:38,104 --> 00:35:52,771
Also Honduras in South America they
had a very high life expectancy.

204
00:35:54,240 --> 00:36:08,979
Austria, very low, Romania forget it,
very low and all the countries that were

205
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:15,760
socialists countries, that means people
could get medicines without paying,

206
00:36:15,865 --> 00:36:29,365
had the lowest life expectancy.
The average was coming to 60

207
00:36:29,469 --> 00:36:34,854
where other countries were
coming up to 70, 72.

208
00:36:34,958 --> 00:36:54,135
Greece on 1970 or 68,  forced medical
doctors to come the villages.

209
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:59,698
It says, first you go to the village,
you practice there for 2 years and then

210
00:36:59,802 --> 00:37:03,000
you can come back to the city.

211
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:14,188
So all these young doctors went all over
 Greece, treating allopathically the population

212
00:37:14,292 --> 00:37:20,750
and today we are very low in the scale.

213
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:29,687
Unless you take into consideration these
 things, you cannot really find the solution.

214
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:40,625
As we go down we also see more and
more difficulty in finding the remedy.

215
00:37:40,729 --> 00:37:49,802
So another parameter that shows
that the case is low in that scale

216
00:37:49,906 --> 00:37:54,646
is the fact the remedy
 is not clear.

217
00:37:55,417 --> 00:38:03,385
Further than that, if you see that in
a case, several remedies indicated,

218
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:07,646
then it goes lower that scale.

219
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:14,000
The more clear the remedy,
the more high will be in the scale.

220
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:23,385
Here, where there is total confusion,
you give one remedy and in 2-3 days

221
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:28,625
you may have to change the
remedy and give another one.

222
00:38:28,729 --> 00:38:35,292
Here you must not change the remedy for years. You give one remedy and you may wait

223
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:39,958
for 1 or 2 years to see the effect and
the organism is improving,

224
00:38:40,063 --> 00:38:51,000
improving with one remedy.

225
00:38:51,104 --> 00:38:53,156
All potencies are useful, we don't say,
we are prescribing in our school

226
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,729
  high potencies or low potencies.

227
00:39:01,833 --> 00:39:09,417
We prescribe all potencies depending
 on the condition of the patient.

228
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:17,115
A lot of wrong information has been
given concerning my teaching.

229
00:39:17,219 --> 00:39:22,313
In the beginning they would say, oh George
 gives only high potency and when they saw

230
00:39:22,417 --> 00:39:29,146
actually what I was doing, they changed.
But you know misinformation is going on

231
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:41,938
in all levels; it is the disease of our
 times and you have to be very careful

232
00:39:42,042 --> 00:39:44,823
what you hear about the rumors.

233
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:57,938
So I would like to hear some questions to
see whether you understand the model.

234
00:39:58,042 --> 00:40:09,333
This is very important to understand quite
well before start treating a patient.

235
00:40:11,125 --> 00:40:17,271
-I would like to ask if there are certain
 remedies that give a clue in case of

236
00:40:17,375 --> 00:40:23,115
 children that they are healthier
in their expectancy of life.

237
00:40:23,219 --> 00:40:29,365
For example if a child needs Calcarea.
Does it indicate already

238
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:32,927
the direction of health of the child?

239
00:40:33,438 --> 00:40:43,604
-In the past I have said that I have observed
 that in the children, if the child is a clear

240
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:50,917
Calcarea carbonica, that means
that this child has quite a good health.

241
00:40:51,021 --> 00:41:06,521
And I still maintain this idea. If the Calcium is disturbed, it is a very strange phenomenon

242
00:41:06,625 --> 00:41:19,604
that in a child who needs a lot of Calcium
and the Calcium absorption is disturbed and

243
00:41:19,708 --> 00:41:24,073
 you give Calcarea Carbonica
and it is reestablished etc.

244
00:41:24,177 --> 00:41:33,771
It is strange that this child will live
healthily for many years whether

245
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:40,896
another child that does not have at this
age, this disturbance but has another

246
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:52,958
disturbance which does not point to
 Calc but points to another remedy

247
00:41:53,063 --> 00:42:03,052
 or between one or two remedies.
Why such a child should have

248
00:42:03,156 --> 00:42:16,896
a worse health than the Calcium?
The organism when it's stimulated gives

249
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:37,688
out a disturbance which is of the
least danger. This is a good sign

250
00:42:37,708 --> 00:43:00,271
but a child who needs Aethusa, why?
Because is vomiting everything it takes,

251
00:43:04,292 --> 00:43:12,552
 he needs Aethusa and not Calc,
that child if you see its development

252
00:43:12,875 --> 00:43:18,313
you will see that its health is
not as good as the Calc.

253
00:43:19,417 --> 00:43:31,521
The predisposition that has been triggered
 it's on a deeper level on the model,

254
00:43:31,625 --> 00:43:35,781
the predisposition that has been
triggered already at the age of 2

255
00:43:35,885 --> 00:43:43,563
is deeper than the predisposition
of the Calc child.

256
00:43:50,708 --> 00:43:58,740
-This is a question, maybe to think that
is also very important the remedy

257
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:10,573
which you need to begin to see the prognosis.

258
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:25,438
This case, you said Calc or Sulph etc. and
it's right but maybe there are other remedies?

259
00:44:26,167 --> 00:44:31,052
-I will tell you. Maybe I gave the
wrong impression. I did not say

260
00:44:31,156 --> 00:44:34,094
the name of the remedy is important.

261
00:44:34,198 --> 00:44:43,979
I say, the kind of disturbance is important.
 That means if I see a disturbance where

262
00:44:44,083 --> 00:44:51,333
I expected to be, a child needs a lot of
Calcium and cannot take it,

263
00:44:52,844 --> 00:44:59,938
 his organism gives out a reaction.
Then this reaction is Calc.

264
00:45:00,042 --> 00:45:10,000
I give it and I reestablish the absorption of Calcium. If the absorption of Calcium

265
00:45:10,104 --> 00:45:16,771
is disturbed then it's a good sign in the child.
But if something else is disturbed,

266
00:45:17,417 --> 00:45:22,875
 that means the absorption on a more complicated level,

267
00:45:22,979 --> 00:45:30,333
which gives out instead of Calc.
symptoms, it gives out symptoms

268
00:45:30,437 --> 00:45:40,021
 of Sulphur, that means an eczema
 comes out in the child.

269
00:45:40,083 --> 00:45:45,313
So it's not the Calcium, it's something
 else which is disturbed

270
00:45:45,417 --> 00:45:51,521
or a series of other minerals which
are disturbed, giving as a result

271
00:45:51,625 --> 00:46:02,229
a generalized skin eruption.
If this skin eruption points to Sulphur,

272
00:46:02,333 --> 00:46:09,469
 it is a worse state than the Calcarea
Carbonica but still a good state.

273
00:46:09,573 --> 00:46:20,698
If the skin eruption needs first Fagopyrum and then Tuberculinum and then Sulphur.

274
00:46:20,802 --> 00:46:29,781
Then we have a problem with that child.
That child is more seriously sick.

275
00:46:29,885 --> 00:46:42,760
Its life expectancy is more in danger.
But what is the most natural you expect?

276
00:46:42,865 --> 00:46:51,333
The disturbance on Calcium
 and you see it, that's a very good sign.

277
00:46:56,198 --> 00:47:12,583
-Excuse me I insist more. I wish to ask you
 if on one level where we have sickness

278
00:47:12,688 --> 00:47:23,854
or a child who needs Calcium but when
we have another sickness, multiple sclerosis

279
00:47:23,958 --> 00:47:36,542
 or epilepsy, I wish to ask you if the name of
 the remedy, if the remedy is showing also

280
00:47:36,594 --> 00:47:48,625
the prognosis? Because only the remedy
 can show how deep this problem is.

281
00:47:48,729 --> 00:48:01,563
For example epilepsy, we have Ignatia
epilepsy and Cuprum epilepsy.

282
00:48:01,667 --> 00:48:16,563
Only by the name, Ignatia is more functional, Cuprum is more organic. This is my question.

283
00:48:16,667 --> 00:48:28,604
-I understand. You cannot say that.
There is some truth and it is like this.

284
00:48:28,708 --> 00:48:46,521
If you need a remedy for epilepsy in a child
and that remedy takes him away from epilepsy

285
00:48:46,625 --> 00:49:00,896
 but develops now all kinds of acute diseases where you need to treat the child constantly.

286
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:13,125
Because he gets into bronchitis, then
 he gets into cystitis, into pneumonia.

287
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,625
That is a different prognosis than a remedy you've given -whatever it might be the remedy-

288
00:49:19,729 --> 00:49:27,781
and has reestablished the health of the
child and the child remains good, healthy.

289
00:49:27,885 --> 00:49:35,188
So the epilepsy with one remedy that
was cured and the child remained healthy

290
00:49:35,292 --> 00:49:49,167
 is better prognosis than the epilepsy that was cured but brought about some other problems.

291
00:49:51,552 --> 00:50:04,354
I had a child with severe epileptic fit and
 I treated the child and the child developed

292
00:50:04,458 --> 00:50:12,094
the children's epidemic disease after the cure.
And every time he had the chicken pox,

293
00:50:14,906 --> 00:50:24,802
 his EEG was going down. That means with
 the force of the acute disease the organism

294
00:50:24,906 --> 00:50:31,667
tended to go back to epilepsy. Not appearing
epileptic fit but when you check out the EEG

295
00:50:31,771 --> 00:50:43,729
you see it's preparing for the next fit.
Then I treat it and he had mononucleosis.

296
00:50:45,865 --> 00:51:01,938
And then again the EEG is coming
up again. Then he had this or that and

297
00:51:02,042 --> 00:51:12,896
you continue to treat but always with
the idea that maybe he will get a relapse.

298
00:51:13,063 --> 00:51:20,406
That's not a good prognosis for the child.
You have other children, you give one remedy

299
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:28,552
 and you see the EEG becoming normal and stays normal and the child is quite healthy,

300
00:51:28,844 --> 00:51:38,719
 it's not in that condition. Now let me tell you something else according to this model.

301
00:51:38,823 --> 00:51:54,906
These levels can be affected
by microbes and bacteria,

302
00:52:00,292 --> 00:52:10,052
streptococcal infections, staphylococcal infections you can see in these cases.

303
00:52:10,156 --> 00:52:19,646
Usually what you see in such cases,
that they have some chronic problems,

304
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:33,000
 treated with antibiotics and these
bacteria change into Proteus,

305
00:52:33,104 --> 00:52:57,240
 treated further it changes into Bacillus Pyocyaneous or Pseudomonas.

306
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:20,979
It's a very strange thing that you realize
 that if the person has been on this level,

307
00:53:21,083 --> 00:53:26,667
his health has come down quite considerably.

308
00:53:26,771 --> 00:53:38,000
 In that state in which he is now, down here,
cannot be affected by microbes or bacteria.

309
00:53:38,771 --> 00:53:49,292
And then you go all types of Fungi will
eventually develop in that body.

310
00:53:50,042 --> 00:54:03,406
So as you go down the ladder, you
notice that the organisms are affected by

311
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:29,021
microorganisms, virus and here in
these levels comes the AIDS virus.

312
00:54:32,646 --> 00:54:39,938
You have to bring your health to
that state, very much low,

313
00:54:40,042 --> 00:54:46,406
before you can be affected
by the AIDS virus.

314
00:54:46,510 --> 00:55:10,115
In this state here, you cannot be affected anymore by the gonococcus or the Syphilis.

315
00:55:10,219 --> 00:55:22,219
Syphilis can affect people up to here. From
here downwards Syphilis cannot be contracted.

316
00:55:24,552 --> 00:55:36,865
These people are protected from gonococcal infections because they have very bad health.

317
00:55:37,646 --> 00:55:46,979
Here belong people who are
disturbed mentally, emotionally etc.

318
00:55:47,000 --> 00:56:00,063
Take a person from a mental asylum,
anybody with schizophrenia and make him

319
00:56:00,167 --> 00:56:09,875
have intercourse with one who has
 Syphilis. He will never get it.

320
00:56:15,875 --> 00:56:25,396
Eternal happiness. You get him to
 have sex with somebody

321
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:29,427
who has Gonorrhea. He will not get it.

322
00:56:29,531 --> 00:56:41,365
Make this person here with
severe mental disorders,

323
00:56:41,469 --> 00:56:59,229
inject microbes if you want in his
organism. He will not be infected.

324
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:08,521
 If he is affected then during the
time of the infection, that means

325
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:16,750
 when he has a very high fever,
his mind will come back to normal.

326
00:57:17,792 --> 00:57:30,031
These are observations which all
psychiatrists who have worked in hospitals,

327
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:35,292
they know for sure to be true.

328
00:57:36,885 --> 00:57:43,365
There was a period of time,
 in the history of psychotherapy

329
00:57:43,469 --> 00:57:59,365
where they said, 'inject Tuberculus
bacillus into the schizophrenics

330
00:57:59,469 --> 00:58:09,229
 and then you create a reaction
and then you see some amelioration'.

331
00:58:09,333 --> 00:58:19,406
The problem was that when the fever
 was rising, it had to stay high

332
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:28,542
for a long period of time and then of course
they were getting afraid that the person will die

333
00:58:28,646 --> 00:58:36,667
 and would give him back the antibiotics
and back into the state of schizophrenia.

334
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:46,021
These, you think, they are theories.
They are not theory,

335
00:58:46,125 --> 00:58:53,083
they are the rules that
rule health and disease.

336
00:59:11,198 --> 00:59:17,979
- Hahnemann said about the intensity
of the external influence.

337
00:59:18,083 --> 00:59:26,646
But in this case, when you inject
something, especially to Hepatitis B

338
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:36,271
or C which is from blood transfusion,
 what do you mean about this?

339
00:59:36,375 --> 00:59:44,854
Hahnemann said, when these influences
are very strong can become,

340
00:59:44,958 --> 00:59:52,583
can be the origin of a chronic disease.

341
00:59:55,469 --> 01:00:12,823
-He does not say that. I should put it to you
 as an exercise to find out. Hahnemann,

342
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:35,917
what exactly says concerning the effect of the
human body if you inject foreign substances,

343
01:00:36,021 --> 01:00:48,375
 which are the paragraphs in which he talks about the effect on the human organism?

344
01:01:05,156 --> 01:01:21,448
Another question since you are writing
is, where Hahnemann mentions

345
01:01:21,552 --> 01:01:34,510
the idea of a second or third remedy?
Under what conditions?

346
01:01:37,333 --> 01:01:45,698
-There are people who are mentally ill,
Alzheimer patients for example.

347
01:01:45,802 --> 01:01:51,156
So they wouldn't get a flu or a
pneumonia and to die for that.

348
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:58,563
-This is correct, if they do get, during
the course of the pneumonia

349
01:01:58,667 --> 01:02:11,333
their mental state will improve
but the pneumonia will kill them.

350
01:02:12,906 --> 01:02:18,604
The pneumonia is not
treatable homeopathically.

351
01:02:18,708 --> 01:02:29,802
It can be treated allopathically and throw them back to the state of Alzheimer condition.

352
01:02:29,906 --> 01:02:36,958
Homeopathically you will not be able to
treat a pneumonia (very seldom phenomena)

353
01:02:37,063 --> 01:02:44,073
that develops, in an Alzheimer person.
Unless there is a possibility for a cure

354
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:51,365
of that person, in which case you will see a
clear picture of the pneumonia remedy

355
01:02:51,469 --> 01:02:56,271
and then you give and then you give the
2nd, the 3rd and maybe you bring back the

356
01:02:56,375 --> 01:03:03,156
consciousness and awareness
of the people, very improbable.

357
01:03:04,958 --> 01:03:10,802
The most probable is that during
the pneumonia now, they will die.

358
01:03:10,906 --> 01:03:20,469
Even with allopathic treatment
is very possible that they will die.

359
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:32,625
-If a person has got AIDS and you treat
 him and he develops gonorrhea,

360
01:03:32,729 --> 01:03:35,313
 would you say the case is on the right way?

361
01:03:35,417 --> 01:03:46,771
-Yes, I will show you a case that I was
treating with AIDS, he was in that state.

362
01:03:46,875 --> 01:03:54,896
It is very interesting also if you have some experience with AIDS people,

363
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:06,354
the young AIDS people who are suffering,
they started with  a very good

364
01:04:06,458 --> 01:04:16,313
state of health. Very strong people,
what they did?

365
01:04:16,354 --> 01:04:21,854
They took gonorrheas, they took
antibiotics, again gonorrhea

366
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:30,823
again antibiotics, then syphilis,
again antibiotics etc. then eventually

367
01:04:31,083 --> 01:04:41,740
you have the development of AIDS virus.
That means they broke down from here,

368
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:49,823
usually people of that level, AIDS people
and you see they bring down, fungi,

369
01:04:49,927 --> 01:04:58,760
 they are full of fungi etc. and then
 virus and then the AIDS.

370
01:04:58,865 --> 01:05:08,896
During the state of AIDS, you ask them,
'did you stop having sexual intercourse?'

371
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:19,958
They say, no. 'Did you get again gonorrhea?',
 'No'. 'Did you get syphilis?', 'No'.

372
01:05:20,063 --> 01:05:25,646
I treated such a person and I predicted
 in the class, not in front of him,

373
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:31,292
I said, this person with this
remedy is going to be better.

374
01:05:31,396 --> 01:05:40,813
Now he will be so much better that if
 he goes again and have unprotected sex,

375
01:05:40,917 --> 01:05:47,917
he will then again get Gonorrhea and it
happened exactly as I predicted.

376
01:05:50,823 --> 01:05:58,313
 He got better, he got Gonorrhea,
he treated Gonorrhea with antibiotics

377
01:05:58,417 --> 01:06:01,573
and then back to the state.

378
01:06:04,292 --> 01:06:13,031
You are able, if you really know the model,
 you are able to do these things.

379
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:20,917
I predicted another case, they brought me
 in London again, a case of AIDS.

380
01:06:21,021 --> 01:06:33,229
 And I said if he keeps away and he does not reinfect, he will live 20 more years, no problem.

381
01:06:33,333 --> 01:06:42,333
He was a man 53 years old, why?
Because his remedy was very clear.

382
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:56,583
 I said, with this remedy this person can live 20 more years, though he had the secondary state.

383
01:06:56,688 --> 01:07:00,823
You know in AIDS we have different
stages. We have 3 stages.

384
01:07:00,927 --> 01:07:07,823
The first stage in which we have
very mild symptomatology,

385
01:07:07,927 --> 01:07:12,563
the second stage in which we have the AIDS related symptoms, we have the glands swollen,

386
01:07:12,667 --> 01:07:23,563
we have the diarrhea and the exhaustion and then we have the third stage in which we have

387
01:07:23,667 --> 01:07:32,760
the Kaposi sarcoma and usually the
pneumonia Carinii develops very frequently

388
01:07:32,865 --> 01:07:39,885
and this makes them
fast to go the next stage.

389
01:07:42,844 --> 01:07:51,333
So if you get pneumonia Carinii
forget it, they have reached here,

390
01:07:51,438 --> 01:07:54,031
how can you find the remedy?

391
01:07:54,135 --> 01:07:58,760
Every time they try to find the remedy
there is no possibility to see it.

392
01:07:58,865 --> 01:08:02,698
The case I'm talking about is AIDS
related, we have the diarrhoea,

393
01:08:02,802 --> 01:08:09,573
the exhaustion and
 the lymphadenopathy.

394
01:08:10,208 --> 01:08:16,729
At that stage some organisms are still quite strong, they show the remedy, you give them,

395
01:08:16,833 --> 01:08:24,187
you uplift them and then again back
to the possibility of getting reinfected

396
01:08:24,292 --> 01:08:34,094
 because all these groups here,
are affected by Gonorrhoea and Syphilis.

397
01:08:34,198 --> 01:08:40,250
There is a state under which Gonorrhoea
and Syphilis do not affect.

398
01:08:40,354 --> 01:08:48,427
The same as the people in mental asylum.
 They can live in a terrible situation,

399
01:08:48,667 --> 01:08:59,771
 they can sleep in mud the whole night, they wake up in the morning, nothing happens.

400
01:08:59,875 --> 01:09:08,062
No pneumonia, no bronchitis, nothing.
How is that?

401
01:09:08,167 --> 01:09:17,708
Can you sleep one night inside the water?
See what happens next day.

402
01:09:34,156 --> 01:09:43,729
Do you perceive what I say? These children
 here they will not get epidemic diseases.

403
01:09:43,833 --> 01:10:00,104
Because here we have epilepsy and
during this state of epilepsy the child

404
01:10:00,208 --> 01:10:03,448
cannot get any epidemic disease.

405
01:10:03,552 --> 01:10:08,917
 You treat him with epilepsy, you bring
him up and then he starts being infected

406
01:10:09,021 --> 01:10:21,240
by different agents which are for
this level in which he is.

407
01:10:25,177 --> 01:10:37,802
You see, Fungi it can be all this. All this can be affected by Fungi, different types of Fungi.

408
01:10:37,906 --> 01:10:51,063
All this can be affected by bacteria,
Gonorrhoea, Syphilis etc.

409
01:10:53,865 --> 01:11:06,927
And virus can affect up to here. From
 here, downwards virus cannot affect.

410
01:11:10,865 --> 01:11:24,156
Is it possible for any schizophrenic
 to be affected by AIDS? It's not possible.

411
01:11:25,375 --> 01:11:37,104
If he is affected by AIDS,
he will improve mentally.

412
01:11:38,906 --> 01:11:50,448
- I disagree with you. We have the AIDS
 induced encephalopathy

413
01:11:50,552 --> 01:11:56,083
and this can have forms
 of schizophrenia too.

414
01:12:32,042 --> 01:12:39,406
-You are talking about a different thing.
The symptomatology of AIDS can affect

415
01:12:39,510 --> 01:12:47,292
also the central nervous system where
 we have mental symptomatology.

416
01:12:49,927 --> 01:12:59,115
The AIDS itself, that means the virus,
can affect different parts of the system.

417
01:12:59,219 --> 01:13:09,854
It can affect the lungs, the liver, the brains,
 the nervous system; in certain cases of AIDS,

418
01:13:09,958 --> 01:13:25,979
 we have the effect of the virus upon the
central nervous system. Why this is so?

419
01:13:26,083 --> 01:13:40,760
Because of the predispositions I was
talking on the different people.

420
01:13:40,865 --> 01:13:45,031
Once they have a predisposition on the
mental, once the disease is overwhelming

421
01:13:45,135 --> 01:13:49,979
it will affect the mental level as well.

422
01:13:50,083 --> 01:14:04,760
What I say is, that a schizophrenic who is from 16 years old to schizophrenia, now he is 40.

423
01:14:04,865 --> 01:14:12,313
You may him have sexual intercourse
 with a person who has AIDS.

424
01:14:12,417 --> 01:14:21,760
He will not get the disease, he is protected
by the fact that he is more sick;

425
01:14:21,865 --> 01:14:31,333
he is on a lower level than AIDS can affect.
This is what I'm saying.

426
01:14:40,708 --> 01:14:48,229
-Is it true that there is a predisposition
 to the vaccination for the babies?

427
01:14:48,333 --> 01:14:53,115
Would you say that some of them
are born with predisposition?

428
01:14:53,219 --> 01:14:58,021
And therefore they react, some of them react and some of them don't react to the vaccination?

429
01:14:58,125 --> 01:15:01,146
-Yes exactly.

430
01:15:13,177 --> 01:15:23,333
If you vaccinate these people
here, there is no effect.

431
01:15:23,958 --> 01:15:30,927
-No, what I mean is, when they are 2-3 months old, when you give the first vaccination.

432
01:15:32,375 --> 01:15:37,469
Is there predisposition that might cause the reaction to the vaccination?

433
01:15:37,573 --> 01:15:51,646
-Yes. If they had a side effect, a complication
 that means they had a predisposition towards

434
01:15:51,750 --> 01:16:00,563
that disease. If they have a big reaction,
they have quite strong predisposition

435
01:16:00,667 --> 01:16:09,938
and if that leaves them invalid, that means
the predisposition was really great.

436
01:16:13,177 --> 01:16:17,760
The vaccination will affect this
population not at all.

437
01:16:17,865 --> 01:16:31,021
From here on, you get a kind of a
reaction and there is a point in this,

438
01:16:31,125 --> 01:16:38,854
where all these people are predisposed
 for that particular disease.

439
01:16:38,958 --> 01:16:45,896
Then you will have in these levels a
 big reaction and then you have

440
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,000
the side effects of vaccination.

441
01:16:58,573 --> 01:17:04,219
Let me take it from another point of view.

442
01:17:10,396 --> 01:17:15,938
Every organism has or has not
predisposition for certain diseases.

443
01:17:16,042 --> 01:17:24,583
Let us take Poliomyelitis. There are
certain people from us, who have

444
01:17:24,687 --> 01:17:33,396
a predisposition for that disease.
If these people get the Polio vaccination,

445
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:40,781
 they are going to have a big reaction.
Some of us whose their predisposition

446
01:17:40,885 --> 01:17:49,177
 is very great, they will actually get
symptoms of Poliomyelitis.

447
01:17:52,000 --> 01:18:00,250
So the vaccination actually, what it does?

448
01:18:01,292 --> 01:18:06,854
Those who are predisposed in an
epidemic will get the disease,

449
01:18:06,958 --> 01:18:13,292
makes them get it in any case
 through the vaccination.

450
01:18:16,156 --> 01:18:25,521
The claim is, they say, that if the epidemic comes, the deaths will be more.

451
01:18:25,625 --> 01:18:34,562
The argument is that if you give vaccination
 to all population, then you will have

452
01:18:34,667 --> 01:18:43,000
a massive side effect from mild to serious
which we have to measure whether

453
01:18:43,104 --> 01:18:54,823
 all this massive effect, that means bringing down the level of health in a massif population

454
01:18:54,927 --> 01:19:03,271
is it worthy? Or is it better than having the epidemic itself and treat the epidemic?

455
01:19:03,375 --> 01:19:07,333
If it comes.

456
01:19:12,042 --> 01:19:20,604
I don't know, I cannot say for sure what
 is better. I have an idea but my ideas

457
01:19:20,708 --> 01:19:28,240
concerning health and disease are different
than the ideas of the governments.

458
01:19:34,708 --> 01:19:45,448
-You say that a patient who has epilepsy
 will not be affected by vaccination.

459
01:19:45,552 --> 01:19:54,354
I had a patient, I managed to treat, not to
cure but to control the fit of epilepsy

460
01:19:54,542 --> 01:20:02,188
 for a certain time. He cut himself and his
 mother rushed to the doctor

461
01:20:02,292 --> 01:20:07,917
and he had the tetanus vaccination.
The fit started all over again.

462
01:20:08,021 --> 01:20:13,833
 Can you explain to me
how that happened?

463
01:20:44,375 --> 01:20:52,896
-This is exactly what I say. You treated
this child and from this level

464
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:58,052
you brought it up to this
level, no epilepsy.

465
01:20:58,156 --> 01:21:02,938
Now the vaccine comes while
 the child is on that level

466
01:21:03,104 --> 01:21:06,135
and brings the child
back to this level, of the epilepsy.

467
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:15,521
This is what I say, that if the vaccine has
any effect at all is to bring down the health

468
01:21:15,625 --> 01:21:24,854
and protect the organism from the
microbes and the bacteria.

469
01:21:29,396 --> 01:21:37,750
Smallpox is acting on these levels,
only on these levels.

470
01:21:38,375 --> 01:21:44,021
What you have to do is to bring
all this population down here

471
01:21:44,125 --> 01:21:50,250
through vaccination and then smallpox
will not affect you anymore.

472
01:21:50,354 --> 01:22:00,875
That is why in older times when they used
 to use the vaccination for smallpox,

473
01:22:00,979 --> 01:22:07,448
people were having chronic conditions
after  the vaccination, headaches,

474
01:22:07,552 --> 01:22:14,188
 epilepsy, asthma. From which cause?
 The vaccination.

475
01:22:14,292 --> 01:22:19,948
Ok, give Thuja. That's how the idea
 of Thuja came against vaccination.

476
01:22:20,052 --> 01:22:24,708
Thuja treated a lot of such cases.

477
01:22:25,802 --> 01:22:34,927
The idea is that unless you bring down
 the organism, you don't protect it.

478
01:22:35,469 --> 01:22:42,740
If the organism has a reaction,
these organisms most of them,

479
01:22:42,844 --> 01:22:49,271
 especially this type of people, will have
 a big reaction to vaccination and

480
01:22:49,375 --> 01:22:53,937
they counteract the vaccination.

481
01:22:54,042 --> 01:22:58,469
 That means that the vaccination
is as if it was never given to them.

482
01:22:58,573 --> 01:23:05,312
That's why in a study they did in India
where we had smallpox epidemics

483
01:23:05,417 --> 01:23:12,146
the epidemic came in a town
where it was vaccinated.

484
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:20,073
And another town was left unvaccinated.
 The epidemic came and the results

485
01:23:20,104 --> 01:23:26,156
were equally the same with the vaccinated
 and the non vaccinated population.

486
01:23:27,438 --> 01:23:35,354
Those who died were the same amount
with those who died non-vaccinated.

487
01:23:39,135 --> 01:23:44,448
You will say, but smallpox
has been eliminated.

488
01:23:44,552 --> 01:23:57,781
I would claim, that smallpox because it was affecting only this part of the population

489
01:23:57,885 --> 01:24:05,125
you brought all the population down
here and then you protect it, of course.

490
01:24:06,667 --> 01:24:17,333
If the theory is correct then we may have to rethink what are we doing to the population?

491
01:24:17,438 --> 01:24:26,000
If what he says, which is my experience also, that after treating somebody who is quite well,

492
01:24:26,104 --> 01:24:32,271
then you give a vaccination and you bring
him down again, that means that there is

493
01:24:32,375 --> 01:24:36,698
something wrong with the idea of vaccination.

494
01:24:36,802 --> 01:24:45,292
With AIDS now, they found a vaccination
 that protects the people.

495
01:24:46,042 --> 01:24:51,292
That means they will bring down
 all the population down here.

496
01:24:52,333 --> 01:24:58,563
Mentally sick people can not be
affected anymore by AIDS virus.

497
01:24:58,667 --> 01:25:06,625
That means you have madness
all over but no AIDS.

498
01:25:25,906 --> 01:25:30,938
-What offers this protection? Is it
that the force of the disease

499
01:25:31,042 --> 01:25:36,823
is already spent on a focus?
Or the vital force or the reaction

500
01:25:36,927 --> 01:25:42,156
of the organism is no longer
 to get affected by these smaller ones?

501
01:25:42,292 --> 01:25:47,042
What is the protection of the organism
when is too sick by one thing

502
01:25:47,146 --> 01:25:49,583
 to be affected by a smaller one.

503
01:25:50,573 --> 01:26:00,729
-There is no protection. What I say is:
the more the population raises,

504
01:26:00,833 --> 01:26:09,781
the more are affected by virus
and microbes of that area.

505
01:26:09,885 --> 01:26:14,625
The more we bring down the health of the population, the more the population is affected

506
01:26:14,729 --> 01:26:28,271
 by new virus, by new bacteria, by new microorganisms that are going to be discovered.

507
01:26:28,375 --> 01:26:38,667
I have predicted in 1970 the effect of
AIDS and actually I was talking on the Greek

508
01:26:38,771 --> 01:26:50,760
and it is recorded on tape. I said to them,
the way you are prescribing antibiotics

509
01:26:50,865 --> 01:26:56,229
 is going to break down the immune system
 and a new disease will appear

510
01:26:56,333 --> 01:27:04,385
which will not be treatable by anything,
I could not name it, this is AIDS or whatever.

511
01:27:10,531 --> 01:27:17,292
And actually what happened was exactly that. The immune system was broken down

512
01:27:17,396 --> 01:27:24,531
by frequent use of antibiotics to the
highest risk group that were

513
01:27:24,958 --> 01:27:34,406
the homosexuals who were taking
as protection every day, antibiotics.

514
01:27:44,063 --> 01:27:48,917
 They were finding someone to have sex
and before they use to take antibiotics

515
01:27:49,021 --> 01:27:55,271
 to protect them from contracting
Gonorrhea or Syphilis.

516
01:27:55,375 --> 01:27:58,938
Many of them contracted the Gonorrhea
and Syphilis inspite the protection

517
01:27:59,042 --> 01:28:04,667
and they had to take
big doses of antibiotics.

518
01:28:04,771 --> 01:28:18,740
In 1983 when I knew the whole situation
 I said, this disease is a venereal disease

519
01:28:18,906 --> 01:28:25,375
and it's a combination of Gonorrhea,
Syphilis and antibiotics.

520
01:28:26,021 --> 01:28:36,854
And Coulter was present, sitting in the
class and then he brought out the book

521
01:28:36,958 --> 01:28:49,188
Syphilis and interconnections which is wrong.
Because he grasped part of my idea,

522
01:28:49,292 --> 01:28:54,188
 not the whole idea. It's not the Syphilis
 that has a connection, no.

523
01:28:54,292 --> 01:29:00,813
It's the Syphilis, Gonorrhea plus
antibiotics. The 3 combined breaks down

524
01:29:00,917 --> 01:29:05,740
the immune system and then you have
 the development of AIDS virus,

525
01:29:05,844 --> 01:29:17,594
 which virus was always there on the planet.
 It's not something new that comes from Sirius.

526
01:29:19,833 --> 01:29:25,896
The virus was always with us but it did
not affect us. The moment you bring down

527
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:35,875
the immune system, that particular virus
explodes and overwhelms the organism.

528
01:29:35,979 --> 01:29:45,031
Then it becomes very virulent because
 it takes strength by breeding.

529
01:29:45,135 --> 01:29:56,823
If you breed a virus you make it stronger.
 Then this virus can affect even somebody

530
01:29:56,927 --> 01:30:03,802
who has never taken an antibiotic
 but whose health is quite low.

531
01:30:04,844 --> 01:30:11,271
You see if the health is low, our health
 is low, we are in danger of AIDS.

532
01:30:11,375 --> 01:30:18,427
If our health is here, not danger.
If it is here, no danger.

533
01:30:18,531 --> 01:30:23,354
If we are close to die, no danger. If we
are close to absolute health, no danger.

534
01:30:23,458 --> 01:30:26,708
Otherwise we are in danger.

535
01:30:29,021 --> 01:30:38,135
-We know from children disease, that
whenever a child who is normal and healthy,

536
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:44,646
contracts a children disease and
then it comes over the disease,

537
01:30:44,750 --> 01:30:56,271
he gets into a healthier state. Does it mean
 that if you have normal children diseases,

538
01:30:56,917 --> 01:31:07,042
they are the source of something good for them which is bringing their health to higher levels?

539
01:31:14,875 --> 01:31:24,469
-That is correct to a certain extent because
 with epidemic children diseases you may have

540
01:31:24,573 --> 01:31:32,271
 another level which is  the eternal level,
you may have the death of the child also.

541
01:31:32,375 --> 01:31:43,583
So after a disease you may have the side effect of the disease that means much worse health,

542
01:31:43,688 --> 01:31:52,229
you may have the same health and in
some cases it may be even improved.

543
01:31:52,333 --> 01:32:00,760
The idea is if you have homeopathic treatment where the organism is stimulated well,

544
01:32:00,865 --> 01:32:05,906
then most probably you have a
better health than before.

545
01:32:06,469 --> 01:32:12,646
But not without homeopathic treatment.
Without it, you may have death, side effects,

546
01:32:12,750 --> 01:32:16,958
same conditions or sometimes better.

547
01:32:18,417 --> 01:32:23,406
- Next question is concerning
 the remedy Carcinosin.

548
01:32:23,510 --> 01:32:30,760
With this remedy we know that often
children do not get the children

549
01:32:30,865 --> 01:32:40,313
diseases or they get it very late in life.
How do you comment this?

550
01:32:43,708 --> 01:32:52,938
-I don't agree with that. With Carcinosin,
if it is indicated, in very few cases,

551
01:32:53,042 --> 01:32:59,646
 you may protect the child from acute
 diseases like any other remedy.

552
01:32:59,750 --> 01:33:06,698
Any other remedy which is indicated will protect the child from getting frequent acute diseases.

553
01:33:06,802 --> 01:33:14,385
Carcinosin belongs to the same
category as every other remedy.

554
01:33:14,490 --> 01:33:23,563
 If you get this wrong idea that if I give Carcinosin, I protect, then it's wrong

555
01:33:23,667 --> 01:33:32,500
 and you are going to dispense a lot of
Carcinosin to the wrong persons.

556
01:33:33,021 --> 01:33:41,271
Only if indicated, whether it is
Calc., Phos., Merc.,

557
01:33:41,375 --> 01:33:48,708
whatever is the remedy
will protect the child.

558
01:33:51,844 --> 01:34:00,365
- I said that with Carcinosin, as
a part of the picture, we may have

559
01:34:00,469 --> 01:34:06,115
absence of children diseases at the
normal age because most of the children

560
01:34:06,219 --> 01:34:12,521
 get the children diseases
and it is written in the book.

561
01:34:12,625 --> 01:34:14,875
-This is wrong, who wrote this?

562
01:34:16,333 --> 01:34:24,958
-In the Materia Medica.

563
01:34:32,375 --> 01:34:41,375
If you read my Carcinosin, you will not
see such a thing and it is beyond logic.

564
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:56,521
Unless there is indication of Carcinosin, and
it really improves the health of the person,

565
01:34:56,625 --> 01:35:00,760
there is no protection.
The only protection is, if it is indicated

566
01:35:00,865 --> 01:35:15,156
 and it has an effect, if you just give
it routinely to protect it's wrong.

567
01:35:18,250 --> 01:35:31,698
-Let's say a person who has in the
 family history, he has had cancer.

568
01:35:31,802 --> 01:35:38,917
So this should be that he was
born in the state which is here

569
01:35:39,021 --> 01:35:41,979
so he can contract the children
diseases which are there.

570
01:35:42,083 --> 01:35:47,979
That's why we are missing the
picture of the remedy.

571
01:35:50,333 --> 01:35:58,469
-A person with cancer parents can
 be born in any place.

572
01:35:58,573 --> 01:36:05,563
He can be born here with cancer
which is curable. It doesn't mean that

573
01:36:05,667 --> 01:36:20,604
he will be born here. But if you give
Carcinosin in this place and then you raise

574
01:36:20,708 --> 01:36:28,938
and you bring him here, on the contrary,
he will contract the disease.

575
01:36:29,042 --> 01:36:34,740
 It is the opposite, not only you don't
 protect from children disease

576
01:36:34,844 --> 01:36:49,052
but you expose it to chronic disease.
I mean in our litterature if you go and read

577
01:36:49,156 --> 01:37:02,219
 all the opinions of different people,
you can go crazy. Everyone has an idea.

578
01:37:03,313 --> 01:37:08,177
You have to use your logic.

579
01:37:12,042 --> 01:37:28,104
-As I understood if the picture of the disease
is clear or not is a parameter to recognize

580
01:37:28,208 --> 01:37:37,333
if the constitution is good or bad. Does that
 mean that if we would know more

581
01:37:37,438 --> 01:37:44,927
 remedies more clear that we
could recognize much more?

582
01:37:46,885 --> 01:37:54,708
This would mean that the constitution
would depend on our knowledge.

583
01:37:56,021 --> 01:38:02,958
-In a way yes, that is true. What is
 going to happen in the child,

584
01:38:03,063 --> 01:38:08,000
depends on our knowledge,
absolutely yes.

585
01:38:08,104 --> 01:38:16,375
But there are some rules
that we cannot overcome.

586
01:38:16,479 --> 01:38:24,313
You can say that nevermind what
disease the child has, if I knew very well

587
01:38:24,417 --> 01:38:34,000
 Homeopathy I could save everybody
and lift them from this prognosis of dying

588
01:38:34,104 --> 01:38:39,667
in 5 years I could make him
 live until 90, this forget it.

589
01:38:40,771 --> 01:38:48,094
But if you say that out of these children
 who are dying at the age of 10,

590
01:38:48,354 --> 01:39:01,448
you can save 5% and if I know better
 I can save 20%. This you can say it.

591
01:39:01,552 --> 01:39:08,448
You can also say that if I know
Homeopathy better, then I can lift a child

592
01:39:08,552 --> 01:39:12,865
from this level to this level, not to
this only. This you can do.

593
01:39:13,417 --> 01:39:22,396
But to think that by knowing Homeopathy
you can save all of them, forget it.

594
01:39:23,927 --> 01:39:34,031
-I want to ask if there is any connection between this theory and the epidemic from Romania

595
01:39:34,135 --> 01:39:41,875
of meningoencephalitis which affects
only the people between 30-40 years,

596
01:39:41,958 --> 01:40:10,135
 not the children and it's lethal.
 It's an unknown virus.

597
01:40:34,708 --> 01:40:47,604
-This falls again into what I say.
The swine fever, a new virus.

598
01:40:47,708 --> 01:40:56,896
There are about 20-30 epidemics which
have been discovered the last years,

599
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:14,083
 especially the swine fever which was affecting mostly soldiers who were fighting in Korea.

600
01:41:15,333 --> 01:41:20,188
Most probably they took certain
drugs that predisposed them

601
01:41:20,292 --> 01:41:27,521
  to a particular virus
that brought out like this.

602
01:41:27,625 --> 01:41:37,469
In Romania most probably, you see
the system was giving medicine

603
01:41:37,573 --> 01:41:41,698
to the people without paying.
 Is that correct?

604
01:41:41,802 --> 01:41:43,604
-Yes.

605
01:41:43,708 --> 01:41:50,094
-So anybody could go to the doctor and say,
give me medicine. He would give medicine.

606
01:41:50,198 --> 01:42:00,979
But the medicine was really the good
medicine? Was it quality medicine?

607
01:42:01,083 --> 01:42:15,646
They were over prescribed most probably.
So if you see statistics, you will see that

608
01:42:15,750 --> 01:42:28,115
 Romania is one of the lowest life expectancy, the same with Hungary, with Poland,

609
01:42:28,219 --> 01:42:37,250
with Russia, and all these countries
were low though they had coverage

610
01:42:37,354 --> 01:42:42,156
 by allopathic medicine quite a lot
because it was social medicine.

611
01:42:42,260 --> 01:42:48,917
Everybody could get medicine where in
Greece nobody could find medicine.

612
01:42:49,021 --> 01:42:56,292
 Here, in this island when I came, first
 time in 1968, there was no doctor.

613
01:42:58,823 --> 01:43:11,479
There was an old man living here who played
 the doctor. He would take out your tooth,

614
01:43:11,583 --> 01:43:24,781
he would set your bones and things like that.
Still before him there was nothing but,

615
01:43:24,885 --> 01:43:38,938
  what we call, herbal medicine. The old population used to live up to 90-95.

616
01:43:39,042 --> 01:43:43,896
The younger population, you say,
are you taking drugs? Yes.

617
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:54,563
The pharmacy is selling tremendous
amounts of medicine to a population

618
01:43:54,667 --> 01:44:00,333
that was healthy 20-30 years ago
 and did not need any medicine

619
01:44:00,438 --> 01:44:06,063
 and they lived very long.
Now who sees that?

620
01:44:06,167 --> 01:44:14,042
Is any government who sees that?
 They all close their eyes to the facts.
