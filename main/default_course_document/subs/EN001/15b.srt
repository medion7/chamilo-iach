1
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:27,914
The idea of prevention in Homeopathy 
is not a valid idea.

2
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:40,851
What is the reason? A remedy will act if you have the symptoms of the remedy.

3
00:00:40,938 --> 00:00:50,757
Let us you have no symptoms and you want to prevent smallpox and then you take Thuja.

4
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:55,705
How it can act?

5
00:00:55,792 --> 00:01:04,184
Then you want to make somebody sick through repetition of homeopathic remedies in order to prevent him

6
00:01:04,271 --> 00:01:08,559
from getting the disease. It' s not possible.

7
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:21,455
You take Arnica before you go for surgery or before you go to the dentist.

8
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:29,111
You take Arnica so you don't bleed, that's nonsense, you may bleed more.

9
00:01:33,531 --> 00:01:43,167
Or you take Phosphorus to prevent bleeding because you are going to have an operation? Forget it.

10
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:53,122
-I would like to ask what about the disease prevention of Malaria for instance or other diseases when

11
00:01:53,208 --> 00:02:00,424
people do not want to take vaccinations or other remedies so they take homeopathic remedies preventively

12
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:04,674
as not to get this illness in foreign countries.

13
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:16,080
-I cannot advise this because it has no logic behind that. Where is the prevention? You want to prevent Malaria?

14
00:02:16,167 --> 00:02:23,333
And you take what? Natrum muriaticum or China officinalis or China sulphurica?

15
00:02:24,927 --> 00:02:34,830
-Hahnemann in the Organon writes that during pregnancy one should take Sulphur to soften the psora for instance.

16
00:02:34,917 --> 00:02:36,914
What do you think about this?

17
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:48,080
-I don't agree with this idea. I don't remember where he writes it, if you can tell me I can look

18
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:58,559
maybe he means something else. But I don't agree with the idea of prevention because in order to prevent

19
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:10,205
that means you have to create within the human body, antibodies of the specific disease which you try to prevent.

20
00:03:10,292 --> 00:03:24,958
How to produce antibodies unless you give really the same substance that you are going to prevent?

21
00:03:25,063 --> 00:03:40,622
So you have to manipulate the immune system producing antibodies, so it can prevent. Once you do that

22
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:57,247
you disturb the organism with homeopathic or allopathic medicine. So I don't see the logic behind

23
00:03:57,333 --> 00:04:10,757
and I have not any proof that homeopathic remedy will really prevent anything. I went to India and I said

24
00:04:10,844 --> 00:04:19,622
I don't want to be vaccinated. So I went to a doctor and said please give me a certificate, how much it costs? So much.

25
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:29,747
He gave me a certificate, that was for yellow fever and smallpox and cholera, there were 3 at the time.

26
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:39,830
My organism was already very sensitive and I would be destroyed, I knew it and I said, I don't want it.

27
00:04:39,917 --> 00:04:54,403
I take the responsibility, don't worry. Now if I had taken homeopathic drugs to prevent this, I would think that this was

28
00:04:54,490 --> 00:05:03,125
prevented me from getting cholera or whatever because I was taking homeopathic prophylaxis.

29
00:05:03,211 --> 00:05:08,455
This is how the confusion is formed.

30
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:13,583
I don't have any serious case in which I can have some proof that homeopathic remedy can prevent.

31
00:05:19,292 --> 00:05:23,885
If anybody has this proof, he can give it to me.

32
00:05:25,823 --> 00:05:33,622
-George what about Gelsemium which is supposed to be a preventive treatment to be taken before

33
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:45,469
an exam for example, when somebody is too nervous before an exam he is taking Gelsemium, is it a prevention?

34
00:05:46,500 --> 00:06:00,851
-What about somebody taking Gelsemium before the examinations in order to calm down? This is something else.

35
00:06:00,938 --> 00:06:16,757
You have the symptoms. The people say 'I'm terrible when I go, I tremble, I lose power, I cannot remember'.

36
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:19,247
That is the time you take Gelsemium.

37
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:36,111
That symptomatology starts a few hours or a few days before the examination. Then I say, you take it.

38
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:50,976
And many times the effect is fantastic but he has the symptoms. And the symptoms are going away.

39
00:06:52,917 --> 00:07:05,289
This is not a prevention but to prevent Malaria. If I take China sulphurica and go to Africa thinking that I' m protected

40
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:14,583
that, I don't agree. I don't say, you are protected, I say, you are unprotected if you do this.

41
00:07:20,646 --> 00:07:29,122
-I have a question for vaccination. In your book you write it is very dangerous to get vaccination.

42
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:39,000
So how can we do the prevention? Because getting Malaria is not very funny, for instance.

43
00:07:42,531 --> 00:07:55,531
-If I knew how to do the prevention without the vaccination, I would have 5 Nobel prizes. I don't know.

44
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:11,580
-I have read in a book from R.R. that he suggests to give for instance nosodes of Hepatitis, Malaria, Typhus

45
00:08:11,667 --> 00:08:22,382
and you give double dose of 200 and you get one dose, and after 5 minutes, the second.

46
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:27,091
And I have done this when I'm going to India.

47
00:08:27,177 --> 00:08:28,643
-And you have been saved?

48
00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:31,361
-Yes.

49
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:42,872
-I have done the same and I stayed to India for 3 years and I never was vaccinated with anything, still I was saved.

50
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:48,382
I was also saved without any prevention.
 So it doesn't mean anything.

51
00:08:48,469 --> 00:08:58,070
Giving remedies of high potencies you don't need. One possibility: no effect at all.

52
00:08:58,156 --> 00:09:09,893
Second possibility: maybe some proving is there. Third possibility: you may need one of these nosodes and you are cured.

53
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:14,135
But not prevention.

54
00:09:15,177 --> 00:09:21,205
-On the question of giving Sulphur, as the doctor pointed out, to pregnant women, in Delhi hospital

55
00:09:21,292 --> 00:09:30,622
it was done for 6 months. And in the nursery about 35% infants were born with inexplicable rash on the cheeks

56
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:40,007
which was atopic dermatitis but it was happening over and over again until the Sulphur trial was stopped.

57
00:09:40,094 --> 00:09:48,799
Also the practice of giving Caulophyllum in the last trimester or in the last 4 weeks of pregnancy and we had a lot of cases

58
00:09:48,885 --> 00:09:58,625
going into uterine inertia and those people had to be induced for getting the pains and it had to be stopped.

59
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:16,247
-Correct. What you can do is make the uterus inactive and when it needs to contract to get out the baby, it does not contract.

60
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:34,539
Do you remember, was anybody in Aedipsos? Do you remember this dramatic with a Greek doctor bringing out, twins?

61
00:10:39,552 --> 00:10:57,664
And somebody, an American, went to see her and gave a dose of Sepia 10M because she said, 'I noticed some

62
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:06,164
discoloration in her thigh'. I said 'why did you give her?', 'Because I noticed some discoloration in the thigh'.

63
00:11:07,646 --> 00:11:21,622
What happened is that labor started and stopped. The uterus became inert and we expected

64
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:37,539
from 10 o'clock when it was dilatation of the uterus and should in 2-3 hours deliver, we waited and waited, it was 1 o'clock

65
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:49,976
2, 3, 6 o'clock in the night. The dilatation stayed there and the uterus was totally inactive.

66
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:02,851
By 9 o'clock I said to her, 'give me your symptoms, what do you feel?'

67
00:12:02,938 --> 00:12:13,007
And she gave me symptoms of Pulsatilla, I gave Pulsatilla and I predicted in 1 hour you deliver. It was 3/4 of an hour.

68
00:12:13,094 --> 00:12:24,403
21:45 that started the delivery. And what was the dramatic? The one child came out and the other one

69
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:36,184
came in the wrong position and the gynecologist who was there was trying to manipulate and bring the child.

70
00:12:36,792 --> 00:12:46,622
But the child cannot live very long in the 
uterus if they are from the same ovum.

71
00:12:50,292 --> 00:12:59,757
The woman was fainting, he was telling me tell the woman to push, the woman could not push and then faint

72
00:12:59,844 --> 00:13:09,497
and she was shouting and no contraction and I gave her Carb-veg to bring her back and then she had cramps

73
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:23,875
in the legs and I said, bring Cuprum, give Causticum. And finally at one time the second came out.

74
00:13:24,979 --> 00:13:26,914
What an experience!

75
00:13:28,063 --> 00:13:42,958
We were in a room like this and we had only one scissor of the woman of the house who used it for tailoring.

76
00:13:48,375 --> 00:13:57,914
What shall we do? It was 10, 11 o'clock in the night, 12 o'clock, no helicopter was coming.

77
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,382
I said, what shall we do? He said, we have to cut the boy to save the mother.

78
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:12,219
And one time he says to me, it's finished, it's dead, the boy, he didn't feel it anymore.

79
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:32,049
All the class was there and everybody 
wanted to know what was happening.

80
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:49,455
She is a strange woman, you know. She has now 12 children. And she was shouting, I want my daughters.

81
00:14:50,875 --> 00:15:03,164
I said what about that daughter and save the life of the mother? We only had one scissor to cut, how to get it out?

82
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:10,664
It was not possible to get it out, the boy was coming with the back, it could not pass through the uterus.

83
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:35,625
It was a real dramatic experience which I think if we didn't have homeopathic remedies, forget it. It was no way that we could manage.

84
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:53,580
No contraction, no possibility to get it out, the boy would just die in a few minutes and that would be a very nice

85
00:15:53,667 --> 00:16:00,000
advertising for Homeopathy.
Who is responsible? George.

86
00:16:02,063 --> 00:16:18,424
After that experience I remember we came so close with Tony, the gynecologist. He was sweating and I was

87
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:27,757
exhausted because I was holding her and all the time I was trying to get the symptoms to give the remedies to be able to

88
00:16:27,844 --> 00:16:33,955
push the boy to come out. He said 'I can't turn it, tell her to push I can't turn it'.

89
00:16:35,062 --> 00:16:48,760
She was trying to push and shout 'ah, cramps I can't push' and then she was fainting. He said, 'don't let her faint!'.

90
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:17,542
Nice experience that natural childbirth.

91
00:17:25,271 --> 00:17:39,539
-It's about the preventing. Hahnemann talked about epidemic situation and I want to know your opinion about it.

92
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:50,132
If you live in a situation where there is a very dangerous epidemic what is your opinion about?

93
00:17:50,219 --> 00:17:54,539
-What is a dangerous epidemic, tell me first and then I will tell you?

94
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:07,094
-Cholera or Polio or something like that.

95
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:23,382
-Cholera, if there is an epidemic I would say, ok go ahead, for Polio also, go ahead, not for other  diseases.

96
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:40,518
All the other children's diseases I don't agree with vaccination. Even with Polio, we have a lot of side effects and

97
00:18:40,604 --> 00:18:53,091
with Cholera also. Every time I have a case chronically ill, he was going to Africa, I must get Cholera.

98
00:18:53,802 --> 00:19:06,039
I say, ok take the vaccination and see what happens. Almost invariably there was eventually a relapse of the chronic state.

99
00:19:07,531 --> 00:19:15,622
But I cannot take the responsibility and say, don't vaccinate because one accident might happen and they will say

100
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:24,497
George is responsible because he advised it. For all the side effects nobody is responsible. Everybody accepts it.

101
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:33,361
I lost my child because of Polio vaccination, I have been brought autistic children after Polio vaccination

102
00:19:33,448 --> 00:19:45,539
and the parents say the child started having epileptic fit after vaccination, 2,3 days later, I went back

103
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:51,309
to the pediatrician and he said forget it,
 it's not because of the vaccination. They get away.

104
00:20:06,552 --> 00:20:17,455
Also I don't agree with Hepatitis vaccination, I don't agree and I would advice not to take it.

105
00:20:17,542 --> 00:20:27,716
I agree also that the children must go through the epidemics. If children do not get epidemics, I'm very suspicious

106
00:20:27,802 --> 00:20:40,872
that these children are mentally ill. You do not realize how much a child can be mentally ill because he is functional,

107
00:20:43,115 --> 00:20:55,580
especially if he is very clever. I'm very suspicious. My child is so clever, so intelligent and then it's a Veratrum album.

108
00:20:55,667 --> 00:21:03,500
Then this child will not get an epidemic, it is protected.

109
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:27,664
-It was a man 23 years old, he had some vaccines about 4 years old, and then he developed asthma

110
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:36,934
and allergy and some intestinal problems , by the age of 23 he was really bad and then after 2 months of homeopathic

111
00:21:37,021 --> 00:21:50,914
treatment, he was delivered to the hospital with severe allergy. He was totally covered with some skin eruptions and high fever.

112
00:21:51,000 --> 00:22:05,914
One of the doctors realized that this is not allergy. This is variola and he got the vaccine of variola

113
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:14,736
when he had problem, when he was 4 years old. That means that homeopathic treatment brought out the reasons

114
00:22:14,823 --> 00:22:18,622
for all these problems during these 20 years.
 Is it this?

115
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:20,455
-Yes, you are talking about yourself?

116
00:22:20,542 --> 00:22:22,028
-Exactly.

117
00:22:22,115 --> 00:22:26,156
-I got it.

118
00:22:29,156 --> 00:22:35,750
How do I know? By observation. What did I observe?

119
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:41,757
-Tetanus?

120
00:22:48,021 --> 00:22:55,778
-Tetanus. How many times really tetanus?

121
00:22:55,865 --> 00:23:19,518
I'm living here and one day a plank with a rusty nail fell on my leg and went inside so deep.

122
00:23:23,396 --> 00:23:40,247
Everybody said, get vaccination and I'm a scientist you know? I want to find out. Let's see what happens.

123
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:46,601
Nothing happened of course. All the Greek doctors here were terrified.

124
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:54,341
I said, let me see I don't believe I will get anything.

125
00:24:03,271 --> 00:24:16,007
A child falls in Athens. Where did they see a sheep or a goat in Athens? 50 years ago.

126
00:24:16,094 --> 00:24:35,042
And then they go immediately and vaccinate and then the whole health level goes down. This is my experience.

127
00:24:37,938 --> 00:24:59,778
But this is very interesting, what he related. Russians, the system is you have protection and everybody has to be vaccinated.

128
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:03,885
Everybody has to take antibiotics etc.

129
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:16,184
-I saw tetanus patient, when I was working in the intensive unit in a hospital, he was about 50 years of age.

130
00:25:17,292 --> 00:25:25,917
He already had the tetanic rigors of his jaw and he came into the hospital because he should have been amputated

131
00:25:26,135 --> 00:25:34,458
as his right index finger was the
 entrance of the tetanic organism

132
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:47,164
and 5 days before he went into the hospital,  he suffered from a very small injury in his right finger.

133
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:55,111
He was repairing his caravan and there was in an area where it was only sand and beach, there was no horse,

134
00:25:55,198 --> 00:26:11,042
goat, sheep and the disease came out within these 2 days. First he started with throat pain,

135
00:26:15,417 --> 00:26:20,542
he thought about some flu and didn't do anything and he had troubles swallowing.

136
00:26:32,021 --> 00:26:37,490
He went to a doctor and he was treated for flu.

137
00:26:45,958 --> 00:26:55,646
2 days later he had to go to the hospital because his neck was rigid and he had the tetanic rigors in his jaw.

138
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:12,914
Then the diagnosis was established. He came into the hospital he had already fits, he could not speak anymore

139
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:24,539
he was completely rigid. I don't want to further talk about his development what happened to this man

140
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:30,205
this is another story but when I came home after doing my duty in the hospital, I went

141
00:27:30,292 --> 00:27:36,396
home and said to all the people around, you have to get vaccinated.

142
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,330
-Which part of Germany?

143
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:48,080
-In north.

144
00:27:49,958 --> 00:27:52,747
-In a small town.

145
00:27:54,844 --> 00:28:02,490
-It's only a beach and a place for caravans.

146
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:27,289
- Most probably some animals were there but anyhow nobody denies that Tetanus is a deadly disease.

147
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:36,729
Seldom anybody survives and if he survives he will be injured for life.

148
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:54,622
But with Homeopathy I would be very curious. For instance in this case it would be interesting if this man

149
00:28:54,708 --> 00:29:07,458
had taken Hypericum high doses constantly.

150
00:29:09,792 --> 00:29:18,580
-The problem is nobody even thought of Tetanus when he had this little injury on the finger. It was obvious

151
00:29:18,667 --> 00:29:25,958
only when he was shaking and had these convulsions, these fits.

152
00:29:36,729 --> 00:29:45,289
-10 years ago when I worked as a surgeon in a little hospital in Germany, we had two cases of Tetanus within

153
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:54,958
one month after operation because nobody thought vaccinating them against Tetanus.

154
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:13,510
-Well now that all people are vaccinated, all children are vaccinated, still in Athens hospital there are cases of Tetanus.

155
00:30:16,469 --> 00:30:24,955
-The great problem with vaccinations is that there is no scientific proof of how vaccinations are preventing people

156
00:30:25,042 --> 00:30:31,830
from getting Tetanus. For instance in these 3 cases that are reported by our colleagues I would be highly interested

157
00:30:31,917 --> 00:30:40,205
to know whether they had been vaccinated against Tetanus. In those 2 cases that I reported the vaccination

158
00:30:40,292 --> 00:30:54,063
of Tetanus had been more than 20 years ago, and after they got a little injury their vaccination had not been refreshed.

159
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:17,049
-Theoretically in order to prevent an infection you have to make the whole organism, to bring down the health

160
00:31:17,135 --> 00:31:27,716
of the organism so it cannot be infected by the specific bacteria, virus or whatever. This, at least theoretically

161
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:37,674
is correct and I will explain to you more in theory, what is my idea concerning vaccination.

162
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:52,007
But don't get the idea that I have the answer, how to prevent. Or what is the real truth about vaccination

163
00:31:52,094 --> 00:31:59,309
and whether the vaccination has really done 
good or bad. I'm not in a position to say it.

164
00:31:59,396 --> 00:32:07,688
What I am in a position to say is some theoretical questions that I have concerning vaccination.
