1
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:54,600
One of the greatest things which I broke, it was a rule in Greece very strict rule.

2
00:00:54,700 --> 00:01:01,370
That nobody who is not a medical doctor is not allowed to practice Medicine.

3
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:05,210
I broke this rule for the past 32 years.

4
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:22,350
Another rule I've broken or it appears that I've broken is from this book 

5
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:27,210
which is called the Organon of the Art of Healing, 

6
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:36,100
from which I want to read to you with your tolerance.

7
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,850
I know most of you, you have read the Organon very carefully and some of you, 

8
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:45,700
you may know it almost by heart. 

9
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:54,440
I also had read the Organon with great interest in the very beginning, 

10
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,550
with the greatest interest and the greatest sympathy for what was written there, 

11
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,120
everything was appealing to me.

12
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:17,330
And I remember by that time I was reading par. 18 for instance, 

13
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:30,760
which says from the undeniable truth that besides the totality of the symptoms 

14
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:40,240
nothing else can by any means be discovered in diseases, 

15
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:48,350
we are with they could express their need of aid of cure. 

16
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:58,940
It is only the totality of the symptoms that expresses the need of the disease to be cured.

17
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:08,840
This is correct, it is clear. It follows undeniably without any doubt 

18
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:15,410
that the totality of all the symptoms of the disease 

19
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:23,330
and conditions in each individual case must be the only indication, 

20
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:30,270
the soul guide to direct us in the choice of the remedy.

21
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:39,740
On this par. was based a whole homeopathic movement, 

22
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:48,630
what we call today the Unicist movement.

23
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:54,580
Everyone by that time that I studied Homeopathy, everyone around,

24
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:04,020
in all the books, everywhere I would see search for the totality of the symptoms.

25
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:08,600
And then find the remedy that fits to that totality.

26
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:26,090
I will read you something now which will not agree with that statement and you will be surprised

27
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:34,680
and all my teaching has been based on what I found in practice.

28
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:44,830
In practice I found that this statement was not absolute, it was relative, 

29
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:58,850
to what degree we shall see and I'm sure that almost nobody because myself also 

30
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:04,910
when I read through the Organon, I did not pick up the discrepancies, 

31
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:17,750
the points that were appearing to oppose each other and I was taken over by the general mood,

32
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:28,040
the totality of the symptoms and then it was a day where I decided I'll break this rule.

33
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:37,040
It is not the totality of the symptoms, it is something else and what was the other?

34
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:46,630
Then I brought my experience into Homeopathy and I'll tell you in brief what was my experience.

35
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:12,080
But before I go further, I want to read to you another paragraph from the Organon.

36
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:25,690
Listen to that. It says in another paragraph, I will not tell you which one, it's very interesting.

37
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:30,950
In this search for the homeopathic specific remedy, it says, 

38
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:36,030
in your efforts to find the specific remedy which is indicated, 

39
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:47,700
which means in the comparison you are making between the totality of the symptoms 

40
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:58,440
of the disease with the least of symptoms in a proving, in this comparison you are making, 

41
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:10,790
in order to find between these remedies, these provings an artificial agent 

42
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:24,110
corresponding by similarity to the disease to be cured the more striking, singular, 

43
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:43,960
uncommon and peculiar characteristics, signs and symptoms are exclusively to be kept in view.

44
00:07:51,460 --> 00:08:10,450
Most solely, exclusively, do not pay any other attention but to what is striking, singular,

45
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:20,140
uncommon, peculiar. Where is the totality of the symptoms?

46
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:32,040
Because our subject on which I'm going to talk this time, it is how we select a symptom.

47
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:40,790
Why we take this symptom and not another? Why do we ignore certain symptoms?

48
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:48,290
In a case in practice you will have to ignore symptoms of the case.

49
00:08:48,390 --> 00:09:00,660
So what it says for it is more particularly these very similar ones 

50
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,940
in the list of symptoms of the selected medicine must correspond to, 

51
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:14,540
in order to constitute the most suitable remedy for affecting the cure. 

52
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:22,440
It is these peculiar remedies that must correspond to the peculiarity of the remedy.

53
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:33,200
And continues to say that the more general symptoms and undefined symptoms 

54
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:53,200
and he gives examples like loss of appetite, headache, debility, weakness, restlessness, 

55
00:09:53,300 --> 00:10:05,790
discomfort and so forth demand but little attention from you.

56
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:28,050
So I had broken the rule of the totality of the symptoms and in my teaching, as you may know,

57
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:46,240
I have said that what has to be taken into consideration is first the essence, 

58
00:10:48,490 --> 00:11:07,480
the second is the totality, the third are the keynotes and the fourth is the causative factor.

59
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:38,130
I remember presenting my ideas of one remedy, that one remedy has to be found, 

60
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:44,500
that there is a remedy which we have to find in order to complete a cure 

61
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:53,210
and a doctor from France got up in Congress and says George's ideas are so nice 

62
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:57,230
but this is a utopia.

63
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:07,990
Nobody ever can find one remedy that will cure a case. I'm talking about 10-15 years ago. 

64
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:20,630
Why? Because in his experience this has never happened and I accept that 

65
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:33,900
and in his experience he has seen that giving 3,4,5 remedies that was bringing some effect.

66
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,640
So this was his experience and I accept that but he got up and said this is a utopia, 

67
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:50,220
what this man is talking in front of the class. And then I thought they think it's a utopia!

68
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,460
A utopia for me that was a total reality 

69
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:00,890
because I had been treating with 20-30 medical doctors in Athens, 

70
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:04,650
I had been treating thousands and thousands and thousands of cases 

71
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:11,140
prescribing all the time one remedy, now this man gets up and says this is utopia.

72
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:18,130
I said to myself, well there is a big gap between our understanding 

73
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:23,720
where they are missing some information these people. 

74
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:32,300
And what kind of information they are missing in order to be able to do a better job? 

75
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:42,880
And that was my anguish and my thinking during these years, what shall I do 

76
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:50,380
in order to give enough information so they can do the same.

77
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,720
I would have seen that my students in Greece they could do it, they could repeat 

78
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:01,340
what my thinking was and they could analyze a case and they could have results, 

79
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,340
why not the others? 

80
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:09,340
And then the idea of the videos came about. Because I said to myself 

81
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:18,800
unless I show them really on a video I can present, then maybe they will continue saying 

82
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:24,300
this is not so, this is not so, it's his imagination.

83
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:34,480
But what about breaking the rules of the totality? 

84
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:48,580
Because I remember when I first came and taught in America, well they said where is the totality?

85
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:56,440
I said, where is the totality? I also don't see that a remedy can cover all the symptoms in a case.

86
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:11,160
But in the Organon also which paragraph was right? Paragraph 18 or paragraph 153?

87
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:20,760
Which of the 2 paragraphs was right? I want your feedback on that. What happened?

88
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:33,160
Well the most obvious answer is both are right but therefore we can not take any of them

89
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:36,170
in an absolute spirit. 

90
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,840
The moment that your mind sticks on the totality of the symptoms and you try to find a remedy 

91
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:47,950
that has 22 symptoms, the symptoms of the patient, then you may not be able ever 

92
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:51,510
to fit a remedy to that patient. 

93
00:15:52,760 --> 00:16:00,910
But there are sometimes where you can fit 18 out of 22 symptoms to a remedy, 

94
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:04,750
there you have the totality perhaps. 

95
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:09,450
But in which cases you have the totality and in which cases you have the essence 

96
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:12,160
and what do we mean by essence? 

97
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:25,760
And what do we mean by the keynotes? What is a keynote?

98
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:34,770
Do you know what is a keynote in practical terms? Tell me what is a keynote.

99
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:52,270
A symptom that you will find very frequently with the prover. Do you agree with that?

100
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:10,340
I will give you an example. 

101
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:23,440
For instance if you take Belladonna, you will have a face which is flushed. Is this a keynote?

102
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:33,630
Some they say no and some they say yes, now where is the truth?

103
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:44,090
We like to clarify these matters in order to be able to have a clear judgment, 

104
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:51,930
what we are doing in analyzing a case? Where we'll put our focus of attention?

105
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:23,000
A keynote is something that does not fit the rules, the rules of pathology let us say, 

106
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:31,520
all the rules, the common symptomatology of the diseases.

107
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:52,850
A keynote is a symptom that can be peculiar to only one remedy. 

108
00:18:55,610 --> 00:19:09,340
So we have to combine two factors here. The one factor is whether a symptom is produced 

109
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:17,390
almost always in a person and the other factor in order for this symptom to become a keynote,

110
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:24,740
to be characterized as a keynote, the other factor should be that no other remedy 

111
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:34,730
has that particular symptom. The more the rule is like this, the more we have a real keynote.

112
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:38,560
And we can prescribe on a keynote.

113
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:59,720
If you open your Repertory and you will see in a symptom 1 or 2 remedies covering that symptom,

114
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:09,220
there do you have a keynote?
-Not necessarily.

115
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,100
-Why?

116
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:22,900
The frequency of the appearance in the proving has also to be strong.

117
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:32,390
So if we have a peculiar symptom which is really strong in the proving 

118
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:39,740
but no many remedies have that symptom, then that becomes a strong keynote.

119
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:58,890
So in paragraph 153 Hahnemann talks about keynotes and he talks about keynote 

120
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:08,390
prescribing. But as you said we can not ignore par. 18 where he talks about totality.

121
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:16,140
So therefore we have to make a combination between par. 153 and 18 

122
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:26,000
and when we prescribe pay attention, not only to the keynotes but to the totality as well 

123
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,160
or to the combination of the two.

124
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:40,610
And what is essence? This idea which I brought into Homeopathy.

125
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:47,300
Because there was a misunderstanding on that as well. 

126
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:56,260
When I spoke about essences everybody came out later and they said, well forget totality,

127
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,760
forget the keynotes, you can only prescribe successfully 

128
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,800
if you know the essence of the remedy.

129
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,150
I never have said this.

130
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,960
What I have said it was a different thing. 

131
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:21,390
What is the essence, has anybody understood by reading some of the stolen Materia Medica, 

132
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:22,640
whatever you call it.

133
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:33,970
If you know this little book which was notes of one of my students and eventually was published,

134
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:38,660
what I was describing in essences.

135
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:15,070
Not intuition, I don't want intuition. This is a science, we try to reduce it actually to a science,

136
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:20,480
it is a science and we have to present it as a science and nothing else.

137
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:28,970
Otherwise we will be totally lost if we bring in the factor of intuition.

138
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:35,100
Anybody can say my intuition says give this remedy. My intuition says give the other remedy

139
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:41,240
and you will have 100 intuitions and a dead person.

140
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:48,990
So I never said intuition myself.

141
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:59,890
-It's a deep understanding of the personality of the remedy on the physical, 

142
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:02,940
the mental and the emotional levels.

143
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:09,390
-The understanding of the personality of the remedy. 

144
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:13,610
When you say personality, can you say his personality 

145
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:16,520
and his personality are the same? Never.

146
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:22,770
Two people are ever the same? No. So when you are talking about essence, 

147
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:31,770
you are talking again about the most striking, uncommon characteristics of a case 

148
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:41,020
in another level, not the physical level but the psychological, the mental level.

149
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:50,630
So here we have keynotes on a psychological and mental level combined in such a way

150
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:56,960
as the total effect to be given as the personality of the remedy.

151
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:18,350
And what is your experience and my experience 

152
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:23,610
and the experience of anybody practicing homeopathic medicine, what is it? 

153
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:34,860
That sometimes you have prescribed, a remedy has acted based on one keynote or two keynotes 

154
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:44,860
and sometimes you have prescribed a remedy based on essence and you have success 

155
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:51,030
and sometimes you are based on totality and you have success and some other times 

156
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:59,620
your prescription is actually a combination of all these four factors.

157
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:08,450
Because you see some kind of essence which fits with mostly on his totality 

158
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:13,200
which contains a few keynotes and contains also the causative factor 

159
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:18,700
and then you have a perfect case and then you say my god this is a Natrum muriaticum case,

160
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,550
you can not prescribe something else.

161
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:34,800
Is it possible to put this idea into practice? It is possible.

162
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,950
Can you show us in these three days that you will be staying with us, 

163
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:42,220
can you show us how to do it? Is it possible? 

164
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:50,950
No, it's not possible but the possibility is there, if you want really to learn that. 

165
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:58,710
There is a possibility to learn but you have to stay with me or with my teaching much longer.

166
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:06,450
It's not possible in three days to point out to you all the phenomena, 

167
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:18,870
all the parameters that go along to find the correct remedy in a case.

168
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:25,370
In the cases I'm going to present you I will focus always in these ideas and I will ask you

169
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:34,570
so together we can proceed in understanding my thinking, because I believe that's why you are here. 

170
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:43,200
You have come to understand what is the structure of my thinking, why I give this remedy

171
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:48,960
and not another? What do I do different between my judgment and your judgment?

172
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:54,450
What is the difference and then inside you, you say I judge it differently?

173
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:58,950
And then see the effect. What is the effect? Oh he is right.

174
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:04,960
Because he usually brings cases which have been treated successfully.

175
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:09,950
So if I bring you a case that means I'm right. 

176
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:20,210
When I give you an explanation I will prove it to you that it is right because of the effect.

177
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:29,620
Do you know the difference between somebody presenting a case and myself? 

178
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,510
There is a difference.

179
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:42,660
For the last 15-20 years and actually all my life, due to the fact 

180
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:52,200
that I always had the urge to teach and then I felt this is tremendous thing, 

181
00:28:52,300 --> 00:29:02,550
everybody has to know it, there were always around students. So I could never tell a lie.

182
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:08,450
I'm not alone in my room. How you are and things like that, no. 

183
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:16,040
I'm not good, I'm the same, no problem out. Oh I'm so good. 

184
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:24,790
Film it, we film it and then we take it, we present it to you and say, here it is, big case.

185
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,210
No, not with me.

186
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:37,450
Because in the last years actually all my cases were been able to be seen by the students,

187
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:42,460
so if I ever made a mistake it would be immediately seen 

188
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:48,790
because they say they came year after year, in the seminars in Germany. 

189
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:55,540
I would take cases, I would treat and everybody would see and all my cases 

190
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:00,530
were shown the results of my prescribing.

191
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:06,370
They were not brought into a class selectively, there is a big difference 

192
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:11,290
and I don't think there are many people have this courage, this takes a lot of courage.

193
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:25,290
That's why I got old very soon. I'm only 45 and I look 60, it is because of that reason.

194
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:31,970
Because you are very anxious, the situation in which you are put together says, 

195
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:38,790
here is a case, we bring a pneumonia case, today she will die.

196
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:43,790
Now what you do, show us because you talk to us and you say you treat pneumonia.

197
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:52,630
Show us, here is a case of pneumonia, how you will treat that? That's different.

198
00:30:52,730 --> 00:31:01,880
Then you start the excuses, not this kind of pneumonia. This is progressed pneumonia.

199
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:05,380
Actually they have prescribed another remedy, so they spoiled the case 

200
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:10,400
so I can not find the remedy, lots of excuses.

201
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:21,160
There is one characteristic of my teaching. I never, ever in any case I excuse myself.

202
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:27,220
Here, he is dying, treat it. Here, another one, treat it. I never said 

203
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,060
but you prescribed half of the Materia Medica in that case, 

204
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:34,550
how do you expect me to treat that case?

205
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:43,900
I never said it. So was this a utopia? 

206
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:55,820
What I was seen, what I was perceiving was a utopia? I don't think so.

207
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:20,080
Who was in NY seminar? Sixteen.

208
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:34,200
As I said to that seminar, I will repeat quickly. 

209
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:43,950
For a symptom you need to know the intensity of the symptom, how strongly is felt by the patient

210
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:47,290
because that will be expressed immediately. 

211
00:32:47,390 --> 00:33:07,790
He says, oh my hip joint. I also have a pain in my hip joint and

212
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:13,550
I also sometimes on the wrist. He puts it first there and then there on the wrist, 

213
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:23,790
it's different. When it is vague, forget it. 

214
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:28,280
When George comes and says these things, they say Hahnemann said different things.

215
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:34,700
He didn't say different things. The experience was the same. 

216
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:40,960
I'm absolutely sure and that's why I forgot about totality and he says forget it. 

217
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,960
I mean there is a reality here. Let's see what is the reality. 

218
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:49,090
This, this and that is the reality and then I went back and read the Organon and I said, 

219
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,780
oh my god he has the same experience. 

220
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:57,620
He has said the same things because he has said, totality only exclusively totality, 

221
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:02,120
search for the totality and nothing else and on the other hand he says, forget the totality, 

222
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:12,120
go to the keynotes, go to the peculiar characteristics. So intensity...

223
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:33,040
If a person says to you that in your search for the right remedy, a person tells you that last year,

224
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:38,210
because you asked about last year, the previous year, you want a full case 

225
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:48,310
and he says the last year I have a very severe stitch on my hip.

226
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:58,960
Now this person has come for epilepsy, you are searching and he says last year 

227
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:07,960
I had a very severe stitching pain in my right hip joint, would you take it into consideration, 

228
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:13,800
yes or no? Practical matters.

229
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:23,710
Do you have this stitching pain, do you still have it? He says, no. 

230
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:29,950
How frequently you have it? Oh just once. It was severe? It was very severe. 

231
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:39,200
For how long it lasted? About half a minute. Because he wants to give you some information. 

232
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:43,790
Last year for half a minute you had this and then you take it into consideration 

233
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:43,880
and you are going to prescribe in a case of epilepsy, when there is pains in the hip joints 

234
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:46,060
this is combined. 

235
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,750
Which is the remedy that will come to your mind?

236
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:57,710
Because I have never said this before so nobody can bring the answer.

237
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:19,140
In a case of epilepsy where hip joints also are affected there are two areas of sensitivity

238
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:27,280
to that person where the most probable remedy is Natrum sulphuricum.

239
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:34,180
And if you ask him whether the epilepsy has started after an injury, 

240
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:45,680
then it becomes really the remedy. Why? Because Nat sulphuricum has an affinity for the hip joints. 

241
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:50,530
It affects very frequently the hip joints.

242
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:52,430
A few years ago, I think 85 or 84, I was teaching in Berkley, I was telling the other day 

243
00:38:52,530 --> 00:39:01,200
that it is the only place in the world where insane people are loose and running around.

244
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:09,350
So my wife and myself we went out in the streets and in every corner we'll see somebody shout

245
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:17,010
and making noise and sleep and undressing. In every corner it was somebody.

246
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:21,270
My wife says what's happening here? 

247
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:28,210
And then I had to enquire and they said in Berkley there are no insane asylums 

248
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:33,970
and that would be great if the whole world acted like this 

249
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:40,770
because everybody would be able to see really what is going on with the diseases of today, 

250
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:48,850
who is insane and how much take all away all the sedatives 

251
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:54,400
and let loose all these 5.000.000 of people

252
00:39:54,500 --> 00:40:07,730
and then let us here about the very high quality of medical services of the West. 

253
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:13,240
Because it's in the West, the others are loose in any case. 

254
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:17,480
They do not have asylums, they do not have the possibility to take all the sedatives.

255
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:20,970
So if there is somebody insane is out.

256
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:28,730
But you don't see this phenomenon. So what happened? All this is driven inside. 

257
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:33,810
The diseases driven inside into the deepest recesses. 

258
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:39,060
So I was there in that place, it was amazing, it was a culture shock, 

259
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:48,820
they would call it George has a culture shock, ah he will get used and all these kind of things.

260
00:40:52,920 --> 00:41:07,610
But I was in that place, I was teaching and they said, we have a case that is quite severe 

261
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:12,930
and he is in a hospital, he is a child with cerebellitis, 

262
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:18,180
inflammation of the cerebellum after varicella. 

263
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:29,690
And would you like to see, you know how they put it? Would you like to see? 

264
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:34,780
And my answer always is, I never like to see anybody. 

265
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:43,760
If you bring it to me I will see it and I may even do something 

266
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:52,770
but to like to see a paralyzed child who just comes from the hospital in front of the class,

267
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:59,110
I do not like to see. But anyhow, as I said, I never objected.

268
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:11,280
I said OK, bring the child and I will now show you certain things in this case. 

269
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:25,710
You see there are a lot of theories in Homeopathy. It says drainage, it's one theory.

270
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:33,970
Another theory is treat first the pathology, the real pathology and then 

271
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:36,720
go for the constitutional remedy. 

272
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:52,720
Another theory is you give first all the nosodes, Tuberculinum, Syphilinum, Medorrhinum, 

273
00:42:52,820 --> 00:43:02,470
you give all, clear up the ground and the patient and then go to the constitutional remedy.

274
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:04,270
And there is success.

275
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:09,510
These people who claim all these things, they claim successes as well.

276
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:15,470
What we are talking here and what I feel for Homeopathy which is unjust 

277
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:23,180
is that all these people they claim success but when you come and see all their patients

278
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:30,930
what is the totality of the result, that is very poor.

279
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:35,680
The one or the second case that was presented where I gave Tuberculinum, 

280
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:43,100
Syphilinum, Medorrhinum, Bacillinum and did well, these cases are very few.

281
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:49,850
So we are talking about professional people who are healing others in every day basis.

282
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:55,600
Every day you have to see 10-12 cases and you have to have results.

283
00:43:55,700 --> 00:44:03,030
In 10 of them out or 12 to be professional. 

284
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:17,770
Ten of them must come back and Bill Gray who is here, he came and he tested. 

285
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:23,100
He said I would like to sit with you next to you when you see the case 

286
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:28,510
and I will enquire the patient how do you feel and I will get the answer.

287
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:35,610
So there are people who were treated a month ago, two months ago and Bill Gray

288
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:40,110
was sitting there and said, how do you feel and said, much better, much better.

289
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:47,110
He said, I'm too bored George I'm going. The answers are too boring, it's much better

290
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:52,860
and I know it and this is the idea of the professional. 

291
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:59,770
Much better in a boring manner, to get bored. 

292
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:08,810
Of course the cases I would see by that time they were first cases, 

293
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:16,110
they were not the most difficult cases, they were not the kind of cases I have to see now.

294
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:21,850
Because now what is ending up to me is everything else, 

295
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:30,190
where everybody else has not succeeded and so they bring to me and say, treat. 

296
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:37,200
So I would like to see all these theories applied in these kind of cases 

297
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:41,790
and then I would respect very much.

298
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:57,950
Not only but I have brought you cases to show you, where I have prescribed more than one remedy,

299
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:09,190
to show you in what kind of cases maybe you are justified to go to another remedy, 

300
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:16,520
like Boericke perhaps or some others I don't think they would see cases like the ones 

301
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:21,030
that we see today, these people of the old times.

302
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:24,880
Cases were much more easy during that time.
