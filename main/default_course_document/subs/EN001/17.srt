1
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,235
Theory 17

2
00:00:51,711 --> 00:01:07,815
Thank you. I see a lot of new faces. I want to welcome
you all and wish you have a fruitful week with a

3
00:01:07,827 --> 00:01:23,479
lot of enjoyment and knowledge. I just wanted to
know who is coming for the first time in Alonissos.

4
00:01:28,228 --> 00:02:04,129
Just give me an idea who has come before.
The Romanian group? The majority. Brazil?

5
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:40,910
Moldova? Croatia? Pakistan? Greece? There are
more from Greece. Egypt? Belgium? India?

6
00:02:41,343 --> 00:02:57,175
I remember the phrase of a historian, Toynbee, who
said India the conquered will conquer its conquerors.

7
00:02:57,187 --> 00:03:13,031
You are conquering the worlds with you philosophy and
your yoga. France? French are usually very scanty.

8
00:03:15,286 --> 00:03:53,847
England? Russia? Only one Russian. Spain?
Turkey? Ukraine? U.S.A.? You come to

9
00:03:53,859 --> 00:04:30,967
conquer us? Or we have a chance? Austria?
Ireland? Slovenia? Sweden? Latvia?

10
00:04:33,855 --> 00:04:51,412
A lot of human races are coming together in a peaceful congress
and I hope that this peace that will exist here will spread

11
00:04:51,424 --> 00:05:08,567
all over the world because at the moment the world is upside
down and I am afraid it is going to go much worse very soon.

12
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:30,808
I hope you will be the missionaries of peace
in your countries. Here we try to transmit

13
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:49,847
knowledge for curing people and we try to do
as much as possible with all our efforts,

14
00:05:50,815 --> 00:06:07,739
heart and knowledge but this is not enough because the
world needs urgently good homeopathic treatment because

15
00:06:07,751 --> 00:06:24,839
Homeopathy is either good or nothing. Either you find the
correct remedy or you are just upsetting the organism.

16
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:46,910
This is the problem with Homeopathy and this gentleman
here does not allow me to look at your eyes and

17
00:06:46,922 --> 00:07:05,759
see how you feel about the whole situation. Unless
each one of you becomes a missionary of peace,

18
00:07:06,871 --> 00:07:26,972
spreading the knowledge which you receive the world
has no chance, will kill each other, we’re the most

19
00:07:26,984 --> 00:07:46,711
clever animals existing on earth and we can kill each
other very soon and totally eliminate ourselves.

20
00:07:52,151 --> 00:08:06,292
I feel the world is preparing for a big clash, a big
conflict, I don’t know when it will end. I hope and

21
00:08:06,304 --> 00:08:20,592
we pray it is not going to happen at least in our time.
Your time I don’t know… I hope not in my time too.

22
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:34,835
I was thinking what I shall say. It’s customary in the
first lecture not to see cases because this seminar

23
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:47,698
is primarily seeing cases. But it is customary in the
first hour to speak about some theoretical matters.

24
00:08:49,574 --> 00:09:07,987
I was thinking what should I tell you and most of you have
heard about the levels of health. And most of you were

25
00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:25,454
intrigued by this idea and you came to learn about the
levels of health. I thought I’ll give you my secrets;

26
00:09:26,455 --> 00:09:42,747
how I arrived in this theory. What preceded this theory,
what happened and finally I came down with this concept

27
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:57,909
of the levels of health because this concept is new
not only for Homeopathy but for Medicine in general.

28
00:10:07,246 --> 00:10:26,138
Most of you know that I started treating
cases in 1960, 55 years ago and by chance or

29
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:44,174
whatever you think, the will of God, people
were coming to be treated by hundreds,

30
00:10:45,454 --> 00:10:54,045
so I had the opportunity to observe
what happened if one applies

31
00:10:54,057 --> 00:11:02,262
the idea of Homeopathy, of the
similar remedy, in an organism.

32
00:11:05,054 --> 00:11:18,739
From the first years I realized certain phenomena
that were happening after prescribing the correct

33
00:11:18,751 --> 00:11:33,270
homeopathic remedy. I must tell you that by that time
my success in prescribing were much higher than now.

34
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:48,210
The reason is that the patients now are much more damaged
in their immune systems than they used to be during

35
00:11:48,222 --> 00:12:00,814
the 60s and the 70s. Pictures of the remedies were
much clearer, therefore the successes were impressive.

36
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:10,719
You give one remedy and then there is an
aggravation in chronic conditions and then there

37
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:19,877
is an amelioration. My first observations
after prescribing the remedy was aggravation,

38
00:12:20,437 --> 00:12:30,121
amelioration and soon after people would call me for
an acute. I have an acute, what shall I do now?

39
00:12:30,133 --> 00:12:39,925
You told me not to take allopathic drugs so please
give me the remedy now because you are responsible.

40
00:12:40,382 --> 00:12:49,147
Sometimes they were aggressive, they said you are
responsible because I never had this problem, for the

41
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:57,598
last 15-20 years I never had high fever. Now I have
high fever please give me the remedy to cure me.

42
00:13:00,326 --> 00:13:09,211
I felt, invariably, I had this phenomenon
coming that means people who claim they never

43
00:13:09,223 --> 00:13:17,614
had an acute before for years, now after
the remedy, they were developing an acute.

44
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:36,996
Then the second observation, if I prescribed a
correct remedy for the acute the effect on the

45
00:13:37,008 --> 00:13:50,461
level of health of the people was impressive.
They were jumping into a state of wellbeing.

46
00:13:54,421 --> 00:14:04,251
On the contrary, I was observing that those people
who either by ignorance they came to me for a

47
00:14:04,263 --> 00:14:14,206
chronic condition now they had an acute and went
to conventional doctors to take allopathic drugs,

48
00:14:15,053 --> 00:14:24,773
they took allopathic drugs and there was a relapse of the
chronic condition, then they would come back to me having

49
00:14:24,785 --> 00:14:33,845
a relapse, why you had a relapse, I had an acute and
took antibiotics, cortisone and then I had the relapse.

50
00:14:36,782 --> 00:14:50,929
I describe to you my observations in the beginning
years. I was realizing that when I was asking

51
00:14:50,941 --> 00:15:05,246
them when did you have last time a high fever 39-40
Celsius. I can’t remember, when I was a child.

52
00:15:09,205 --> 00:15:16,537
When I was prescribing a remedy
for their acute they were

53
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:23,134
feeling, they would tell me
many times, young again.

54
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:35,474
They have lost through the chronic condition the joy
they were feeling as children and now after the acute

55
00:15:35,486 --> 00:15:45,797
and after treating the acute they were feeling again
as good as they used to feel when they were children.

56
00:15:50,830 --> 00:16:09,522
Then I took the medical history and I saw that this
person who was having acutes with tonsillitis,

57
00:16:09,534 --> 00:16:27,671
cystitis etc. 20,30,40 years ago these conditions
stopped getting acutes after a period of time.

58
00:16:29,885 --> 00:16:40,853
Then I realized that most probably their
chronic conditions has started when they took

59
00:16:40,865 --> 00:16:51,341
antibiotics and they suppressed their acute
condition, whatever it might have been.

60
00:16:53,006 --> 00:17:08,295
Actually I realized that their condition has started many years
ago and then you could see in their medical history they were

61
00:17:08,307 --> 00:17:24,094
developing certain conditions for which they would take more chemical
drugs in order to suppress the conditions that were arising.

62
00:17:24,797 --> 00:17:40,637
As a result of this process finally a diagnosis
was put like now you have an autoimmune

63
00:17:40,649 --> 00:17:57,222
disease, L.E., M.S., asthmatic condition. I shall
give you an example of what was happening.

64
00:17:57,442 --> 00:18:20,686
I took the medical history of a person and says I used to have high fevers
until the age of 14, then I remember I stopped with the high fevers

65
00:18:20,698 --> 00:18:43,954
and then I developed sinusitis and then I took antibiotics and then I
developed hay fever and then I had drugs for hay fever, anti-congestants,

66
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:57,199
cortisone to stop the hay fever bothering
them and eventually they started with

67
00:18:57,211 --> 00:19:10,035
difficult respiration and after a while
they started with real asthmatic condition.

68
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:24,853
So when they come to us and I see the history and then I give a
remedy and there is an aggravation and then amelioration and

69
00:19:24,865 --> 00:19:39,331
maybe after 5 months needs a second remedy and some cases after
a year a third remedy some cases after 2 years of treatment,

70
00:19:39,843 --> 00:19:54,851
4 remedies already, then there is a reappearance
of an acute. I considered this as a

71
00:19:54,863 --> 00:20:09,707
very important observation because I concluded
that the organism has a continuation,

72
00:20:12,195 --> 00:20:21,031
the organism is not something broken, you have
tonsillitis, you give a remedy and finished with

73
00:20:21,043 --> 00:20:29,890
it, then you have sinusitis, I give antibiotics
and finish with this part, then you have asthma,

74
00:20:30,531 --> 00:20:37,980
I give you anti-asthmatic and
finish with this part, then

75
00:20:37,992 --> 00:20:44,939
you have insanity… I say there
must be a continuation.

76
00:20:45,322 --> 00:20:59,690
If the organism is not reset, if it
has not come back to real health

77
00:20:59,702 --> 00:21:14,498
by a medicine or whatever then continues
to be sick on a deeper level.

78
00:21:19,643 --> 00:21:27,660
It can continue every time to go into a
state on deeper chronic condition more and

79
00:21:27,672 --> 00:21:35,315
more. I said wait a moment, something is
happening here that you cannot ignore.

80
00:21:35,803 --> 00:21:47,180
That means you cannot suppress a condition
without having the effect upon this organism.

81
00:21:47,192 --> 00:21:58,580
And this effect will last for life unless you
have the means to reset the whole organism.

82
00:22:04,394 --> 00:22:17,406
What was the difference between treating people in the 60s
and treating people in the 21st century? The difference

83
00:22:17,418 --> 00:22:29,083
was that by that time the organisms have not been
through excessive drugging and excessive vaccinations

84
00:22:30,259 --> 00:22:38,257
therefore their immune system was still
intact and you can work with that

85
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:45,955
immune system and stimulate it correctly
and then you have the results.

86
00:22:48,035 --> 00:23:05,367
But if the organism is harassed by
repeated injections and introducing drugs

87
00:23:05,379 --> 00:23:21,146
that affect the immune system then
the harmony of the disease is lost.

88
00:23:22,097 --> 00:23:34,770
Disease has a harmony but if you inject wrongly
different things to fight the disease, it

89
00:23:34,782 --> 00:23:47,889
starts be convoluted, confused and what appears
in the end after 30 years of wrong treatment,

90
00:23:48,994 --> 00:24:00,750
appears an organism who is confused and you cannot
see really what is going on. And then you have the

91
00:24:00,762 --> 00:24:13,107
diseases we get here, they will give a catalogue of
pathologies of which they are suffering at this moment.

92
00:24:16,105 --> 00:24:33,770
That means all the systems and organs of the
body have been affected by this process of

93
00:24:33,782 --> 00:24:52,665
suppressing the condition. Give me painkiller.
This morning I had a case which I was treating,

94
00:24:54,113 --> 00:25:09,583
she developed some acute so she took
anti-inflammatory drugs first and then heavier drugs

95
00:25:09,595 --> 00:25:24,561
and she ended up in the hospital with panic
state. And then she writes to me "save me".

96
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:44,352
Because though she was a student, she had
heard some things here, yet she went and took

97
00:25:44,364 --> 00:25:57,185
the anti-inflammatory drugs instead of
asking, I have this problem what shall I do.

98
00:25:59,897 --> 00:26:15,315
Such an organism who is not allowing the
picture of the disease to manifest and

99
00:26:15,327 --> 00:26:31,721
closes the expression of the disease… Our
imbalance has some expression all the time.

100
00:26:32,074 --> 00:26:42,594
I don’t feel good, I feel tired, I have a
headache, the headache comes in the evening,

101
00:26:42,606 --> 00:26:52,290
then I have some vertigo etc. All these
symptoms are expressions of the disease.

102
00:26:52,834 --> 00:27:03,721
If you have a headache, take a remedy to stop the
headache, if I have a pain in the guts I take

103
00:27:03,733 --> 00:27:14,745
an anti-inflammatory drug, if I have pain on the
right hip I take another anti-inflammatory drug…

104
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:32,850
You don’t allow to see the full imbalance of the
organism fully expressed. It is so important that

105
00:27:32,862 --> 00:27:49,674
people who are quite sick with chronic conditions
to go through suffering allowing things to happen

106
00:27:50,449 --> 00:28:02,095
so the one who is attending the case
will recognize finally the remedy which

107
00:28:02,107 --> 00:28:13,008
is indicated. There is another phenomenon
which happens with homeopaths;

108
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:24,594
the moment that a patient has some problems calls the
homeopath and the homeopath immediately jumps giving a

109
00:28:24,606 --> 00:28:35,386
remedy. That most of the times doesn’t correspond to
the full picture, it corresponds to the local picture,

110
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:42,849
therefore giving a kind of
suppression to the organism as well.

111
00:28:43,361 --> 00:28:52,763
The homeopathic remedy can also suppress the
manifestation of the symptoms which you

112
00:28:52,775 --> 00:29:01,857
know in order to reach the organism the
state which I call the harmony of disease.

113
00:29:03,114 --> 00:29:22,669
The harmony of disease is when the disease has
manifested signs and symptoms clearly of a particular

114
00:29:22,681 --> 00:29:42,442
remedy. This is the harmony of the disease, otherwise…
as the organism started with high fever acutes,

115
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:50,423
preceded into more chronic
conditions, sinusitis,

116
00:29:50,435 --> 00:29:56,833
and then preceded to hay
fever, and to asthma…

117
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:08,895
by treating such an organism you start with his
asthma and his asthma is getting better but at the

118
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:19,482
same time the organism starts going backwards and
whatever was suppressed will manifest again.

119
00:30:22,097 --> 00:30:36,850
Therefore, there is no one remedy that can be
given to a person and cure him for good. Because

120
00:30:36,862 --> 00:30:51,161
this organism has stages of imbalance, stages
of diseases that have to come back one by one.

121
00:30:54,217 --> 00:31:15,023
Therefore, slowly the idea of the levels of health
was created. And in this idea the most obvious sign

122
00:31:15,035 --> 00:31:35,449
that an organism is doing better was the developing
of a very high fever. Not once but several times.

123
00:31:44,073 --> 00:31:52,498
What I tell you in a nutshell
it was in the minds of medical

124
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:59,841
doctors, of homeopathic
doctors… it was in confusion.

125
00:32:00,561 --> 00:32:09,717
Now he has a chronic condition, we give the remedy,
now he has an acute, we give another remedy…

126
00:32:09,729 --> 00:32:18,329
and after 5 years a person with chronic condition,
comes and says he is in the same state.

127
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:42,828
Because it was just taking around the organism not improving
according to this order. Our organisms are constructed

128
00:32:42,840 --> 00:33:04,754
in such a way that if something comes against it, a
nosological agent or stress or an environmental condition,

129
00:33:05,722 --> 00:33:15,631
is able to face that stress and return
back to normal. I give you an example.

130
00:33:15,643 --> 00:33:24,929
In a very hot environment like this
one, I am suffering, I am perspiring…

131
00:33:38,778 --> 00:33:55,348
Perspiring is a reaction of the organism, perspiration is necessary
to keep the balance of it so the organism always has a reaction

132
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:11,314
whenever he is stressed by a stressor of whatever kind, the
organism will have a reaction and then the organism will come back.

133
00:34:12,497 --> 00:34:31,730
I’ll give another example. You have an unfortunate
incident where a beloved person died or left you

134
00:34:31,742 --> 00:34:50,409
– this doesn’t happen so much with the Indians but
with the Europeans- and there is a big stress.

135
00:34:54,121 --> 00:35:12,195
You lost a beloved one, the natural reaction of the organism
is to cry for some days or 2 months and then organism

136
00:35:12,207 --> 00:35:28,721
will say forget this, he is a fool, I am not going to
cry for the rest of my life and find somebody else.

137
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:41,902
This is a healthy reaction. An unhealthy
reaction is, I lost and this loss has brought

138
00:35:41,914 --> 00:35:53,850
about a change in my energy complex level
and after that incident I cannot breath,

139
00:35:54,794 --> 00:36:07,113
I try to take a deep breath and… you may have this
condition for years. And then he comes to you and

140
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:19,090
relates it to this and you say take a dose of Ignatia
and Ignatia makes the reset of the organism.

141
00:36:20,393 --> 00:36:28,314
Now I can breathe again, together with
the depression that you have and all

142
00:36:28,326 --> 00:36:35,737
the kinds of things… Ignatia takes
all these away and there is a reset.

143
00:36:40,409 --> 00:36:55,749
You have to imagine that our organisms are receiving
since childhood a lot of such stresses, the

144
00:36:55,761 --> 00:37:10,321
greatest of which are the initial vaccinations
which are given to us as babies in young age.

145
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:18,621
Because the vaccinations are addressed
to the immune system and they say

146
00:37:18,633 --> 00:37:26,705
to the immune system you produce
antibodies so I cannot get a high fever.

147
00:37:30,555 --> 00:37:55,441
When I realized this that actually the vaccinations were
to prevent having epidemics and acute conditions it was

148
00:37:55,453 --> 00:38:19,250
damaging the immune system and not helping it. Today
there are 20 vaccinations which are given in young age.

149
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:34,821
You can imagine the confusion of the immune
system receiving all these vaccinations and

150
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:48,401
after a compromised immune system, a child
living in a family experiences some problems.

151
00:38:49,370 --> 00:39:04,337
The man is treating his wife quite badly and the child is
looking this fight between the parents and is paralyzed

152
00:39:04,349 --> 00:39:18,146
because he cannot do anything. Some children cannot
stand this and will hit the father or the mother etc.

153
00:39:22,338 --> 00:39:33,484
A compromised immune system comes with the stress
and the child develops an asthmatic condition

154
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:44,538
and cannot breathe, and then he takes cortisone
or antibiotics and is becoming worse and worse.

155
00:39:47,314 --> 00:40:02,806
And comes to the age of 30 is a damaged organism and
comes to the homeopath and says fix me. What do I have

156
00:40:02,818 --> 00:40:18,466
now? I have some epileptic fits, I cannot think, my
memory is very bad, I have headaches etc… very difficult.

157
00:40:23,258 --> 00:40:29,511
Who can fix it? The one who really
understands what has happened to this

158
00:40:29,523 --> 00:40:35,874
organism. Unless you do understand with
the first reaction the person has,

159
00:40:36,314 --> 00:40:47,140
you do not realize that this is a good reaction
and you give remedies to stop the effect. I

160
00:40:47,152 --> 00:40:58,578
remember a case of a doctor, student of mine, he
was actually a professor of Medicine in the 70s,

161
00:41:00,065 --> 00:41:11,162
he was the doctor of the French embassy.
The French embassy referred to him all

162
00:41:11,174 --> 00:41:21,449
their problems, so the ambassador had
a son who was suffering with asthma.

163
00:41:27,553 --> 00:41:42,626
This professor who was a younger student of mine,
he did not know very much, he took the case

164
00:41:42,638 --> 00:41:57,081
of the child, brought it to me, the child was
taking homeopathic remedies but specialties.

165
00:41:57,577 --> 00:42:18,940
In France they have specialties. A bottle for asthma,
about 30 remedies, other for headache, hay fever

166
00:42:18,952 --> 00:42:38,874
etc. He was taking a lot of these for years and
there was no effect. The asthma was progressing.

167
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:54,392
They call me, took the case, brought the child and
I saw the remedy which was a miracle after all

168
00:42:54,404 --> 00:43:08,434
these remedies and I said the child needs Sulphur.
The ambassador jumps and says "No Sulphur!".

169
00:43:15,066 --> 00:43:24,537
Why? He said because when we gave him
Sulphur 7 years ago there was such a

170
00:43:24,549 --> 00:43:34,538
reaction, it brought out eczema that was
terrible and we had to give cortisone.

171
00:43:42,283 --> 00:43:56,033
The ones who were prescribing all these specialties were
supposed to be homeopaths and they told the father never

172
00:43:56,045 --> 00:44:09,203
give Sulphur again to your child. I explained and I said
Sulphur is the only remedy that can save this child.

173
00:44:14,748 --> 00:44:29,436
The next step is mental aberrations, psychotic
conditions. If you suppress the asthma,

174
00:44:29,448 --> 00:44:42,628
it may seem to be better but then you
will have psychotic symptoms developing.

175
00:44:46,259 --> 00:44:58,487
Finally he persuaded the ambassador to start with low
potencies of Sulphur and there was a reaction and

176
00:44:58,499 --> 00:45:10,268
eventually came out treated the boy in continuation
with the appropriate remedies, I can’t remember,

177
00:45:10,803 --> 00:45:20,573
I am talking about 1970-71-72
but I remember this exclamation

178
00:45:20,585 --> 00:45:29,579
of the ambassador "Don’t give
him Sulphur, we are lost!".

179
00:45:31,883 --> 00:45:54,565
If somebody claims he is a homeopath and does not
understand the theory of the levels of health darkness is

180
00:45:54,577 --> 00:46:17,692
coming. Is preparing you for a dark period. We stay
together in the dark, I will still teach you, don’t worry!

181
00:46:19,267 --> 00:46:31,307
From darkness to light! Don’t worry
because we have a backup system. We put

182
00:46:31,319 --> 00:46:43,371
the generator if darkness comes we’ll
know what to do. At least we think so.

183
00:46:54,324 --> 00:47:13,036
All these what I tell you are important facts for medical
doctors in general to understand themselves what

184
00:47:13,048 --> 00:47:31,772
is going on with the human body. I have written an
article "The continuum of a unified theory of diseases”.

185
00:47:32,395 --> 00:47:53,424
Who has read this article? So the rest of you is
uneducated. This article was published 2-3 years

186
00:47:53,436 --> 00:48:14,691
ago in a conventional American journal and about a
month ago I received a letter from that journal

187
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:36,214
saying that we would like to have more articles
from you because your article was downloaded

188
00:48:36,226 --> 00:48:53,972
by so many doctors that lead us… you know
what an impact factor is? Only very few.

189
00:48:54,060 --> 00:49:17,697
The medical journals are evaluated and are given a number,
the impact factor, the impact the journal has upon

190
00:49:17,709 --> 00:49:40,068
readership. I was teaching back in the 70s down at
Roussoum Gialos in a room about this number of people

191
00:49:40,427 --> 00:49:50,479
you can imagine in a about half the size of
this place, one was in the top of the other

192
00:49:50,491 --> 00:49:59,755
almost, packed, sitting on benches, hundred
people in less than the half of this.

193
00:50:01,156 --> 00:50:16,639
As I was teaching there comes and earthquake, in the meantime
the doors were closed and only windows and glasses were

194
00:50:16,651 --> 00:50:32,540
there. I thought immediately if people get panicky they will
jump through the glasses and will have a terrible situation.

195
00:50:32,979 --> 00:50:51,024
So I told them, sit down there’s no problem at all.
Don’t move. I continued. They thought if he is

196
00:50:51,036 --> 00:51:09,092
not afraid then most probably we are safe. The
earthquake was continuing. Then it finally finishes.

197
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:24,328
Then I say now if anybody wants to go out there is
one little door, go only through that door, don’t

198
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:38,644
panic, otherwise you may sit and I will continue
teaching. Nobody left and there was no further movement.

199
00:51:52,075 --> 00:52:05,560
The problem is that the subject on which I am talking
as a try to make it as simple as possible, but yet

200
00:52:05,572 --> 00:52:18,427
it is so new the ideas for you that you may need
some time to ingest and to perceive and understand.

201
00:52:20,532 --> 00:52:36,725
I talk from experience and you are listening to this
experience with another aspect. You have been learning

202
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:52,492
in Medicine, if you have a condition which is determined
by these symptoms this is called L.E. condition.

203
00:52:53,003 --> 00:53:03,091
Then the treatment is cortisone or whatever. You have
learned to think in this way and now what I am telling

204
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:12,740
you is to be careful because you cannot do that because
if you do it, it is going to have a side effect,

205
00:53:13,619 --> 00:53:22,399
they call it side effects of medicine. It’s
not the side effects of the medicine, it is

206
00:53:22,411 --> 00:53:31,203
the reaction of the organism towards these
medicines which are given. It’s the reaction.

207
00:53:32,803 --> 00:53:44,259
When you take an anti-inflammatory drug for
your colic pain and there is as a consequence

208
00:53:44,271 --> 00:53:55,611
a heart infarct, this is not the side of the
drug, it is the side effect of the organism,

209
00:53:56,212 --> 00:54:07,457
the organism says I cannot tolerate this suppression,
don’t suppress me and then the condition goes to

210
00:54:07,469 --> 00:54:18,508
a deeper level, leaves that levels of the guts and
goes to the heart which is a more important organ.

211
00:54:19,764 --> 00:54:32,236
If you suppress this then it will leave and go to
the brain. Therefore, this new understanding in

212
00:54:32,248 --> 00:54:44,605
Medicine is not only for homeopaths, it’s for all
people who are dealing with healing in general.

213
00:54:47,339 --> 00:55:08,516
It’s not possible to touch an organism without
understanding this not because I am saying it. What I was

214
00:55:08,528 --> 00:55:29,516
telling you is the result, the observation, the
experience of many years of treating chronic conditions.

215
00:55:30,964 --> 00:55:40,106
And you are going to see such chronic
cases. The objective of this

216
00:55:40,118 --> 00:55:49,955
seminar is to treat chronic conditions
and you will have the experience,

217
00:55:50,292 --> 00:56:05,881
you will see how difficult it is when you have an
organism who is undermined through stresses, diseases

218
00:56:05,893 --> 00:56:21,644
etc., how the signs and symptoms the organism is giving
are confused, are not presenting a clear picture,

219
00:56:23,523 --> 00:56:41,494
those who know some Homeopathy will
see how much confusion there is by

220
00:56:41,506 --> 00:56:58,475
looking at the case. Ok. Don’t laugh!
Lopez is a permanent student.

221
00:57:00,508 --> 00:57:16,387
She has a special laugh and if she
starts laughing the whole class will be

222
00:57:16,399 --> 00:57:32,926
laughing together with her. Do you want
to ask a question after all this talk?

223
00:57:44,870 --> 00:58:21,979
– You talk about suppression through pharmaceutical
drugs, what is your view of the use of herbs, do

224
00:58:21,991 --> 00:58:58,745
herbs suppress? – Good question. Herbs and complementary
supplements. The herbs is very interesting.

225
00:59:04,746 --> 00:59:14,641
The herbs can have an effect if the organism
is in a quite good condition. If the organism

226
00:59:14,653 --> 00:59:23,690
is undermined through a chronic condition
quite deeply, herbs will have no effect.

227
00:59:24,866 --> 00:59:42,039
There are some organisms that will need a little bit
of a stimulation and this can be from herb and you

228
00:59:42,051 --> 00:59:58,410
can have some effect but the cases we treat are so
deeply disturbed that herbs will have no effect.

229
01:00:00,338 --> 01:00:18,716
Neither these supplements like vitamins. When I was
teaching in the United States I could see most of

230
01:00:18,728 --> 01:00:36,578
the Americans were eating and having at the same
time a handful of different vitamins. All of them.

231
01:00:37,369 --> 01:00:50,150
I am talking about the 80s. I wanted to
understand if this had an effect. What I

232
01:00:50,162 --> 01:01:03,586
realized was that the food they were eating
was junk food that contained no vitamins,

233
01:01:04,010 --> 01:01:21,124
so by taking vitamins there was some effect that
was keeping them in a kind of balanced condition.

234
01:01:21,136 --> 01:01:37,570
None of them could claim that he was cured with
these vitamins or supplements. Just keep going.

235
01:01:39,138 --> 01:01:53,754
It is different than when a homeopathic remedy is given
and resets the organism. Supplement means that I

236
01:01:53,766 --> 01:02:08,393
need a kind of mineral or vitamin and then I take it
and keep the organism in a kind of a balanced state.

237
01:02:09,394 --> 01:02:23,114
But for a cure you need the homeopathic
remedy which is correct. –

238
01:02:23,126 --> 01:02:37,267
They can suppress? - I don’t believe.
He asked if herbs can suppress.

239
01:02:37,634 --> 01:02:51,041
Herbs cannot suppress unless they find some
new types of herbs or they call it herbs

240
01:02:51,053 --> 01:03:03,682
which contains some i.e. serotonin or opium
and they mix and then you feel good.

241
01:03:20,714 --> 01:03:33,160
– What’s your opinion on, if they come to you on
suppressive treatments do you normally take them

242
01:03:33,172 --> 01:03:45,122
off or you give the remedy on other medication?
– Which country are you from? USA? All of you?

243
01:03:45,274 --> 01:04:05,182
That’s why I don’t understand you. Speak English
like my English! Repeat slower and clearer. – When

244
01:04:05,194 --> 01:04:24,715
a patient comes to you on suppressive treatment do
you give the remedy while they are on the drugs

245
01:04:27,082 --> 01:04:37,068
-… Or I wait until they get rid of the drugs
and then I give them. It will depend. If I

246
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:46,850
can get them out of the drugs without any
danger for their health, that is preferable.

247
01:04:47,346 --> 01:05:00,122
But if somebody comes with a heart condition who
takes some drugs we cannot stop, if somebody comes

248
01:05:00,134 --> 01:05:12,410
with epileptic fits and for the last 10 years he
takes antiepileptic drugs, we cannot stop them.

249
01:05:12,753 --> 01:05:19,689
If somebody takes in ulcerative
colitis drugs for the

250
01:05:19,701 --> 01:05:26,521
last 10 years, we cannot stop them.
So what do we do?

251
01:05:26,682 --> 01:05:34,673
Either we say forget it you are not a
good subject for Homeopathy or the

252
01:05:34,685 --> 01:05:42,249
alternative is that you take the
case while they are under the drugs,

253
01:05:42,674 --> 01:05:55,003
try to find the best possible remedy and then you give it
together with the drugs and if on the process within a

254
01:05:55,015 --> 01:06:07,466
month or two there is an obvious amelioration you advise
them to reduce the medication and you go along like this.

255
01:06:07,906 --> 01:06:17,706
You give the homeopathic drug, you reduce the
medication as long as there is an improvement.

256
01:06:17,718 --> 01:06:27,425
Because if you say take the drug and reduce the
medication, the remedy might not be correct,

257
01:06:29,618 --> 01:06:48,242
so they have an aggravation because of the
stoppage of the drugs. – If during homeopathic

258
01:06:48,254 --> 01:07:06,682
treatment of a chronic condition the kid
occasionally takes a product with preservatives,

259
01:07:07,330 --> 01:07:18,034
with supplements and that acutes the disease, should we
give another remedy according to symptoms? Or we just

260
01:07:18,046 --> 01:07:28,274
stop, see how it goes and then continue with one remedy
that was prescribed during the chronic condition?

261
01:07:28,530 --> 01:07:40,030
– Your question is not clear to me. You repeat.
– For example, a chronic condition of a kid and

262
01:07:40,042 --> 01:07:50,954
she took Calcarea carbonica for a period of
time and the she got a cake with preservatives,

263
01:07:51,186 --> 01:07:57,900
not very good products and that acuted the
condition (swallowing , redness etc.)

264
01:07:57,912 --> 01:08:04,722
that it was not before… - She had an allergic
reaction towards the preservatives..

265
01:08:05,578 --> 01:08:11,929
– Should there be another
remedy to suppress according to

266
01:08:11,941 --> 01:08:18,634
these symptoms or should we
continue with Calcarea carbonica?

267
01:08:20,866 --> 01:08:34,579
– If the reaction was really due to preservatives and if
the reaction was on the skin it might have been the effect

268
01:08:34,591 --> 01:08:47,842
of Calcarea carbonica and not the preservatives so therefore
the correct idea is to stop the Calcarea carbonica,

269
01:08:48,202 --> 01:09:01,968
wait to see what happens after the aggravation and then
decide. If it is really a chemical towards which the

270
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:15,506
person is sensitive to, then you will have to give
another remedy in case there is quite a strong reaction.

271
01:09:16,849 --> 01:09:31,558
If the reaction is, in general, on the
skin do not be in a hurry to give

272
01:09:31,570 --> 01:09:46,290
another remedy. This is a rule. Leave
it to develop and see what happens.

273
01:09:47,050 --> 01:10:04,060
I pray to God many times that I get skin eruption myself
to prove to you that I am waiting because God gave me

274
01:10:04,072 --> 01:10:21,554
this reaction which is the best possible, I may live another
85 years… Why should I suppress it? This is the idea.

275
01:10:22,626 --> 01:10:57,755
A skin eruption saves the life of a patient. Suppressing
is totally wrong. You became a student of Homeopathy at

276
01:10:57,767 --> 01:11:33,218
what age? 70? 72! My God! How old are you now? He became a
student at 62 and now he is 72. 62 is a progressed age…

277
01:11:33,802 --> 01:11:56,459
Very nice. He was a student of Roger Morrison.
Both of them. They live close to San Francisco.

278
01:11:56,471 --> 01:12:19,378
–Nowadays many patients come with a complex
condition… - Nowadays people take complex remedies…

279
01:12:21,146 --> 01:12:32,383
- People come with different layers of medicinal
diseases and we consider first layer, second layer,

280
01:12:32,395 --> 01:12:43,978
third layer. So which layer should we start the medicine?
–The uppermost at the moment. He’s on level 7.

281
01:12:44,858 --> 01:12:54,528
Start with the remedy for this level. – And for
that layer which symptoms should we consider?

282
01:12:54,540 --> 01:13:04,634
Mental, physical central or physical particular?
–All. This is what we are going to say all along.

283
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:39,177
What symptoms or which symptoms we are basing our
prescription. We are going to explain to you on the live

284
01:13:39,189 --> 01:14:11,338
cases. – Professor, in diseases like amoebiasis,
parasitic diseases, how do we have to consider them?

285
01:14:11,858 --> 01:14:22,896
As acute or chronic conditions? Because
this condition for example in Peru is

286
01:14:22,908 --> 01:14:34,241
very wide spread and how do we have to
consider them? – For instance amoebiasis,

287
01:14:34,682 --> 01:14:52,770
we consider it as a severe chronic condition,
it’s difficult to manage it. Usually these cases

288
01:14:52,782 --> 01:15:09,930
are chronic, acute conditions are considered
those who have high fever. – Thank you, sir.

289
01:15:10,362 --> 01:15:22,081
In your experience has it even happened that somebody
with an allergy, has been completely cured and never

290
01:15:22,093 --> 01:15:33,386
has repetition of this allergy on that particular
substance? – Yes it has happened but it is difficult.

291
01:15:33,874 --> 01:15:47,893
The allergies in general which are the epidemic kind
of conditions of our societies. Allergic conditions

292
01:15:47,905 --> 01:16:01,401
are mostly the effect of an undermined immune system
and compromised immune system to a great degree.

293
01:16:02,146 --> 01:16:08,767
The immune system cannot deal
with environmental conditions.

294
01:16:08,779 --> 01:16:15,194
You smell a flower and you get asthma.
This is not natural.

295
01:16:15,882 --> 01:16:23,500
In order an organism to reach this
conditions it means it has been

296
01:16:23,512 --> 01:16:30,914
undermined and compromised a lot
and deeply in his immune system.

297
01:16:31,658 --> 01:16:42,254
Therefore the treatment of such cases is difficult
and takes a long time, that means you start and

298
01:16:42,266 --> 01:16:52,874
then there is a relapse and then again and eventually
if they insist they get rid of it, of course.

299
01:16:53,378 --> 01:17:01,768
The patients must insist coming to the
homeopath. – So, you would suggest that they

300
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:10,082
keep away from those substances… - Yes, for
the time-being. They have to keep away.

301
01:17:12,002 --> 01:17:23,133
There are people, for instance who are allergic to milk
and eventually after treating them, after some years,

302
01:17:23,145 --> 01:17:33,882
they try it and there is no problem but there are other
conditions which are quite strong and complicated.

303
01:17:34,562 --> 01:17:46,227
They need constant attention and treatment.
Not simple. Allergies

304
01:17:46,239 --> 01:17:57,562
are the punishment of the human
race for violating natural laws.

305
01:18:03,538 --> 01:18:23,968
Allergies are mostly the effect of vaccinations and
other interferences in the human body and that

306
01:18:23,980 --> 01:18:44,010
is why people who have not access to a lot of
medicines are very rarely suffering with allergies.

307
01:18:50,714 --> 01:18:57,373
– George, can you offer or do you think it
would be useful offering a definition of

308
01:18:57,385 --> 01:19:03,817
a drug and also a definition of a remedy?
Because to me they are two different...

309
01:19:09,099 --> 01:19:18,456
– Definition of the drug is when we have
a chemical substance of whatever kind

310
01:19:18,468 --> 01:19:27,363
and that chemical substance is able to
bring about changes in the organism.

311
01:19:28,683 --> 01:19:53,467
If a chemical drug is capable of bringing about changes
in the organism is considered as drug and is considered

312
01:19:53,479 --> 01:20:18,275
as inimical to the organism. A remedy if it is really
indicated is considered a kind of an energy, not chemical,

313
01:20:20,202 --> 01:20:41,664
which stimulates the corresponding energy of the human
body. If a remedy which is an energy is able to stimulate

314
01:20:41,676 --> 01:21:01,819
the human body is considered as a remedy. If a remedy
does not do anything, it’s nothing, it’s like water.

315
01:21:03,499 --> 01:21:16,274
– How is the level of health in a newborn? – There is no
need to know the level of health beforehand. That means

316
01:21:16,286 --> 01:21:29,187
if I know the level of health, then I know the remedy; no.
The remedy is known through the signs and the symptoms.

317
01:21:30,243 --> 01:21:40,362
So a baby will have some signs and
symptoms. You give the remedy according to

318
01:21:40,374 --> 01:21:50,635
them. If the baby is severely ill,
eventually will require some more treatment.

319
01:21:51,546 --> 01:22:09,855
If the baby is quite healthy the remedy will bring
about a reset of his organism. When an Indian makes

320
01:22:09,867 --> 01:22:26,943
like that… she says ok… half-half. – Please explain
the levels of health on the basis of miasms.

321
01:22:27,590 --> 01:22:37,237
I would like to know whether the miasm during
suppression from first few layers to other is there

322
01:22:37,249 --> 01:22:46,119
any change of the miasm from sycosis to syphilis?
I would like to know… - That is correct.

323
01:22:46,831 --> 01:23:00,926
That means correct treatment will take away a miasm, let us
say the uppermost miasm is the sycotic, and this sycotic

324
01:23:00,938 --> 01:23:13,959
miasm will be taken away by 3 remedies, Thuja, Medorrhinum
and Natrum sulphuricum within a period of a year,

325
01:23:15,255 --> 01:23:28,004
then there is a possibility that the organism will
manifest the syphilitic miasm which will require

326
01:23:28,016 --> 01:23:41,671
Mercury, Aurum, Syphillinum etc. We have seen that an
uppermost layer can go away not only with one remedy,

327
01:23:42,158 --> 01:23:55,020
it needs 3 remedies and underneath you will see
a change of remedies an then it goes towards

328
01:23:55,032 --> 01:24:08,599
syphilitic remedies and the psoric when the organism
breaks out to the skin, with a skin eruption,

329
01:24:09,031 --> 01:24:25,044
then we consider most cases are enriched psoric
cases. But it is wrong if you think that I will

330
01:24:25,056 --> 01:24:40,079
prescribe this remedy because it belongs to the
miasm. If you do that you will be mislead.

331
01:24:41,359 --> 01:24:52,523
You think that a layer is sycotic and
therefore you give Medorrhinum. This is wrong

332
01:24:52,535 --> 01:25:04,376
unless you have Medorrhinum symptoms you should
not give it. You have to be very careful.

333
01:25:16,527 --> 01:25:38,439
– You said at the start of the seminar about the
importance of our mission as homeopaths in the

334
01:25:38,451 --> 01:26:00,374
world. The challenge we face today in the world
especially concerning the vaccination in Brazil.

335
01:26:10,289 --> 01:26:26,037
The vaccination in Brazil is mandatory and a
baby takes about 15-20 vaccinations in the first

336
01:26:26,049 --> 01:26:41,473
year. – The question is what is your opinion
about recommendations, if we need to vaccinate.

337
01:26:55,585 --> 01:27:00,856
If there is kind of homeopathic
drug that could minimize the effect

338
01:27:00,868 --> 01:27:05,529
of vaccination since the vaccination
is mandatory in Brazil.

339
01:27:08,841 --> 01:27:17,772
– Vaccination is mandatory in Brazil and
she is asking what to do if the government

340
01:27:17,784 --> 01:27:25,769
says that you have to vaccinate the
child otherwise it cannot go to school.

341
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:37,118
The problem is that different countries have different
laws and I am not in the position

342
01:27:37,130 --> 01:27:46,376
to fight with all the government all over
the world but what you can do is this;

343
01:27:47,528 --> 01:28:01,360
if you understand that this idea is not correct
then you can have the argument of free choice.

344
01:28:01,372 --> 01:28:13,904
That means if I don’t want to vaccinate my
child I take the responsibility for myself.

345
01:28:14,553 --> 01:28:25,702
Your child is vaccinated and protected so why
should you bother if I don’t want my child to be

346
01:28:25,714 --> 01:28:38,049
vaccinated because your child is protected? Vaccinate
the whole class and 2 students are not vaccinated.

347
01:28:38,704 --> 01:28:58,547
Where is the problem? The danger is with my child and I
take the responsibility. You see? – Can I ask something

348
01:28:58,559 --> 01:29:16,464
just to clarify… If there is any homeopathic remedy
in order to minimize the effect [of vaccination]?

349
01:29:16,929 --> 01:29:34,737
– No. There is no homeopathic remedy that can protect
from epidemic diseases. That means if I give you a remedy

350
01:29:34,749 --> 01:29:52,569
and I tell you now you are vaccinated, let us say Thuja,
and smallpox will not come to you. This is not correct.

351
01:29:54,224 --> 01:30:03,660
What Homeopathy can do is when an
epidemic breaks out then you can

352
01:30:03,672 --> 01:30:13,544
give the most indicated remedy, we
call it the genius of the epidemic,

353
01:30:14,208 --> 01:30:19,694
you can give this to your
child so it can in a

354
01:30:19,706 --> 01:30:25,088
way prevent the disease
from developing fully.

355
01:30:25,472 --> 01:30:44,147
But we do not have a replacement in Homeopathy instead
because if we had that would go against our own

356
01:30:44,159 --> 01:31:03,753
understanding and theory because we would kind of exclude
this organism from coming into an acute condition.

357
01:31:04,681 --> 01:31:26,131
If we find a way to prevent acutes from happening
then we are making humanity more sick. You cannot

358
01:31:26,143 --> 01:31:46,961
prevent. There is a natural selection. The most
weak will die first, and you cannot prevent that.

359
01:31:47,585 --> 01:32:05,046
We have gone against that law of nature and what we have
done, we remained alive in spite of the fact we should have

360
01:32:05,058 --> 01:32:21,785
died at the age of 18,20,40,50 and natural selection will
allow the human race to become healthier and healthier

361
01:32:22,392 --> 01:32:40,892
otherwise if we interfere and we don’t allow
the natural selection then we are making more

362
01:32:40,904 --> 01:32:59,416
and more sick the human race. This is something
which sound very bad but this is the truth.

363
01:33:02,177 --> 01:33:21,109
You want to live longer but you live without
joy, without a feeling of real health. In

364
01:33:21,121 --> 01:33:40,065
our societies very few people, grownups, are
able to produce high fever at this moment.

365
01:33:45,049 --> 01:33:54,472
Unfortunately this is the condition
we have created through all the

366
01:33:54,484 --> 01:34:04,057
drugs and all the things we have
discovered. – Can I put a question?

367
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:21,378
I came from a region with heavy industry
from Romania and in my region where I

368
01:34:21,390 --> 01:34:38,392
practice we have many cases of heavy metal
intoxications. Chronic intoxications.

369
01:34:38,585 --> 01:34:46,236
And I ask you if we can completely
cure these chronic heavy

370
01:34:46,248 --> 01:34:53,272
metal intoxication. – Like
mercury, plumbum, arsenicum…

371
01:34:53,944 --> 01:35:02,024
What happens with this is if you receive a
case and you give the correct remedy the

372
01:35:02,036 --> 01:35:10,320
organism automatically will reject the extra
metal which is in excess in the organism.

373
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:25,260
– But it’s not acute, it’s chronic. Because people
live there and the ground and the trees are with

374
01:35:25,272 --> 01:35:39,088
metals. – If there is a situation where this metal
is everywhere there is going to be a relapse,

375
01:35:39,288 --> 01:35:56,585
even if the organisms reacts in the beginning
quite well… There is an idea that the airplanes

376
01:35:56,597 --> 01:36:11,880
are spraying us with aluminium, barium,
strodium and these are quite bad metals and

377
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:22,378
we inhale them and we take them and create a
problem for us but we live in such a society that

378
01:36:22,390 --> 01:36:32,472
these things can happen and this is unfortunate.
I don’t know how we can deal with this issue.

379
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:41,761
Fighting with the correct remedy is
one thing, but fighting politically

380
01:36:41,773 --> 01:36:49,681
to stop doing these things, on a
governmental level… is another issue.
