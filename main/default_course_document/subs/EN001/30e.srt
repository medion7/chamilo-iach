1
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:39,042
I want to say a few things which I have not said before to such groups they are coming here, in the Academy.

2
00:00:39,146 --> 00:00:52,635
Because the main object of coming here is to observe the application of Homeopathy.

3
00:00:57,542 --> 00:01:15,531
So many people, many times they have come before, they expressed a wonder of what kind of Homeopathy

4
00:01:15,635 --> 00:01:20,479
or case taking is going on here?

5
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:29,417
I have a special way of taking a case
and I never explained really why I do this.

6
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:38,945
So today I want to explain to you what you are going to observe in the taking of the case.

7
00:01:39,811 --> 00:01:59,000
But before I say this, I want to say that if a medical doctor is going to see a case

8
00:01:59,104 --> 00:02:06,896
when he receives a telephone call, somebody is with very high fever and chills.

9
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:17,594
He is not a homeopath.
He goes to see the case.

10
00:02:17,698 --> 00:02:24,729
What is he going to examine?
What is he going to ask?

11
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:29,625
Immediately he wants to know what's going on.

12
00:02:29,948 --> 00:02:45,031
Is this a pneumonia case? Is this a urinary infection? Is this a more severe condition?

13
00:02:47,635 --> 00:03:00,031
So he will start examining, from this point of view, the patient in order to differentiate what kind of a fever is this.

14
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:14,063
How he does this? By using a knowledge which he has received in his medical studies.

15
00:03:14,167 --> 00:03:20,854
And during his internship and then later on in his speciality.

16
00:03:22,698 --> 00:03:28,917
So he will examine the patient with this knowledge in the background.

17
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:46,596
Take another example. A patient comes with some psychological problems to a psychiatrist

18
00:03:46,700 --> 00:04:06,688
who is following the Adler approach, inferiority complex, the social contact behavior of the patient etc.

19
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:19,437
to see whether the problem comes because of the inferiority complex etc. or because of social deficiencies.

20
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:35,542
What is he doing? He's examining the patient according to what knowledge he has received in his speciality.

21
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:52,635
Is he interested whether the patient is thirsty or not? Is he interested whether the patient feels more cold or more heat?

22
00:04:54,125 --> 00:05:07,562
His questioning will be to understand whether he can put the patient into a context which he knows before

23
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:13,927
and so he can prescribe the necessary medication.

24
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:30,125
If he is a Freudian psychiatrist who follows the Freud idea, sexual behavior behind all that etc.

25
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:46,865
he will put questions according to what he knows to understand whether the boy, the girl have traumatic

26
00:05:46,969 --> 00:06:01,896
experiences in their childhood with their sexual behavior, with complexes related to sexual
 sphere.

27
00:06:06,438 --> 00:06:23,479
If he is Jungian, he will try to find out about the subconscious, how much importance there is in this psychotic patient

28
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:30,625
the collective subconscious etc., the dreams.

29
00:06:37,365 --> 00:06:49,833
You go to another speciality. You see somebody broke his elbow, he goes to orthopaedist.

30
00:06:50,792 --> 00:06:56,615
He is not interested whether you have psychological problems or other problems.

31
00:06:56,719 --> 00:07:11,948
He takes an X-ray, he sees it's broken there, he makes a sketch how I put a plastic new hand etc.

32
00:07:18,635 --> 00:07:28,771
So everyone of these people have become good or not or very good according to the knowledge

33
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:34,989
they have attained and how they
apply it in each particular case.

34
00:07:35,281 --> 00:07:43,625
And they do their job quite good,
very good, excellent etc.

35
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,833
Now what about the homeopaths?

36
00:07:53,438 --> 00:08:06,813
You, most probably learn like I use to
 teach also, you must take a full case.

37
00:08:07,594 --> 00:08:17,323
You let the patient talk and let the
patient give you all the story.

38
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:27,479
Don't interfere, don't ask questions
or ask the minimum questions.

39
00:08:28,813 --> 00:08:37,875
And eventually the case will manifest
in front of your eyes.

40
00:08:43,436 --> 00:08:52,351
One time I did an experiment when I had new comers, starting Homeopathy; they did not know.

41
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:59,233
I said, how many of you are medical doctors? Quite a lot, 40% medical doctors, the others chiropracts etc.

42
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:08,396
I said, ok we do an experiment. You take the case of each other and then you give it to me

43
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:15,531
and from the case you give me
I will decide the remedy for each one.

44
00:09:15,635 --> 00:09:18,656
You know what happened?

45
00:09:18,945 --> 00:09:28,021
When I had the feedback each one was writing according to his knowledge and not according to homeopathic case.

46
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:35,156
As a result it was impossible to
 find any of these remedies.

47
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:49,854
The medical doctors have written the medical history. At the age of 6 he had a pneumonia, at the age of 17

48
00:09:49,958 --> 00:10:01,156
he had an infection, he got antibiotics.At the age of this, he got this etc. And this was a homeopathic case.

49
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,542
Totally useless.

50
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:15,938
So what was missing from these cases?

51
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:20,594
Many of them were medical doctors, they have been trained to take a case, a proper case,

52
00:10:20,698 --> 00:10:31,948
 they wrote in detail what has happened. The medical history of this case. What was missing?

53
00:10:33,302 --> 00:10:39,677
It was missing what we call a homeopathic case.

54
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:58,219
Now I had another example. You know in Athens I used to have a center with medical doctors,

55
00:10:58,323 --> 00:11:01,417
about 30 medical doctors working there.

56
00:11:01,521 --> 00:11:09,667
They used to take the case and I used to prescribe, he gave me the case, prescribe.

57
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:25,719
There was one case, a woman doctor who
was programming her cases for 3 hours.

58
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:39,698
10 o'clock first case, 1 o'clock second case
 and she always gave me about 30 pages of information.

59
00:11:40,521 --> 00:11:45,927
I was never able to see the remedy.

60
00:11:56,917 --> 00:12:07,927
Whose problem was? The problem of the teacher who had not explained properly how a proper case is taken.

61
00:12:08,031 --> 00:12:21,896
So while you are here you have to learn how
to take a proper case, as fast as possible.

62
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:32,771
Because in practice a medical doctor needs certain time. He cannot be paid for 3 hours of taking a case.

63
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:43,885
Nobody will pay him for doing that. But if you don't know the way how to take properly a case

64
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:49,458
you will be lost in a lot of useless details.

65
00:12:50,229 --> 00:13:01,438
So how we manage to get away from such a practice? This is what I want to explain to you now.

66
00:13:01,542 --> 00:13:10,615
And what you are going to see me doing,
so you may understand what is going on when
 I take a case.

67
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:20,844
Because here, as I said, you are going to
see many cases. We shall be talking about

68
00:13:20,948 --> 00:13:29,823
differential diagnosis, we shall be talking about other things as well, some theoretical matters

69
00:13:29,927 --> 00:13:38,896
but mostly see cases and how the case is
 taken and how the analysis is for this case.

70
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,750
This is what you are going to see.

71
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:54,354
But you will wonder, especially those who come for the first time, why George interferes so much with the taking of the case.

72
00:13:54,458 --> 00:14:06,646
Why do I interfere and what is happening in a proper case, you want to be a professional

73
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:11,010
and you want to take a case and have a result?

74
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:25,866
As I said, all the other specialities examine the case according to the knowledge they have received in the University.

75
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:39,374
The question now is, what is the necessary knowledge in order to differentiate a case?

76
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:44,688
Whether it is Pulsatilla or Phosphorus or Argentum nitricum?

77
00:14:44,792 --> 00:14:54,344
What is the necessary knowledge that you must have before you can take a case properly?

78
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:09,844
You see the moment that you have a case in front of you and the person starts talking,

79
00:15:09,948 --> 00:15:20,479
already by the first information that you are getting your mind goes to certain remedies.

80
00:15:22,302 --> 00:15:37,167
Now, who is in the best position to find the remedy? The answer is very easy.

81
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:47,083
The person who has the highest
 knowledge of Materia Medica.

82
00:15:48,125 --> 00:16:02,542
With this knowledge of Materia Medica
in our heads, we approach the case.

83
00:16:03,052 --> 00:16:13,313
The more we are experts in knowledge of the Materia Medica, the more we are able to think

84
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:18,833
of several possibilities, immediately
 with the first questions.

85
00:16:23,411 --> 00:16:33,083
The approach that you will be observing here is an approach which comes from the knowledge of Materia Medica.

86
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:51,042
As you know I have the Expert System, sitting next to me, putting symptoms in the Expert System, the VES.

87
00:16:52,323 --> 00:17:04,594
I don't look always in the Expert System, many times I write the remedy in the beginning of the case.

88
00:17:04,698 --> 00:17:13,562
But the investigation continues, I continue the investigation for 1 hour which I'm allowed to take the case.

89
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:19,083
Sometimes I change the prescription but
many times I don't change the prescription.

90
00:17:20,031 --> 00:17:29,792
That means from very early in the case, you
 may be able to have an idea about the remedy,

91
00:17:29,896 --> 00:17:37,281
if you have a good knowledge of Materia Medica.

92
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:49,104
Of course, the VES will help you, will give you some ideas, of course the Repertorisation is necessary.

93
00:17:49,208 --> 00:18:03,146
Of course we have tools to help us decide for the remedy; but if you have not studied Materia Medica in depth

94
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:08,484
it will be very difficult for you to come to a conclusion.

95
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:13,021
You will always feel lost.
Especially if you have difficult cases.

96
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:24,646
If you have studied well 10 cases, most of
your prescriptions will be within 10 remedies.

97
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:37,438
I can guarantee. As I said, I had students
there who were taking cases.

98
00:18:37,542 --> 00:18:43,708
One of them gave 60% of the cases,
Natrum Muriaticum.

99
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:53,729
And he claimed he had some results.
Of course you will have some results. Why?

100
00:18:53,833 --> 00:19:07,594
Because Homeopathy can treat the whole person or can treat some symptoms of the person.

101
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:18,189
We have the possibility to change the symptom, one symptom, two symptoms. We have the possibility to do it.

102
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:33,500
No problem but the real central remedy which will change the level of health of the individual, will not be seen.

103
00:19:34,302 --> 00:19:47,865
And what happens? We start confusing the case and from one remedy to another remedy to another remedy

104
00:19:47,969 --> 00:19:58,229
some people they even give 3 remedies,
the same day, 4, 5 remedies the same day.

105
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:09,927
Take 10 remedies every day and in the
end you say, my headaches are better.

106
00:20:10,031 --> 00:20:16,545
Yes, your headaches are better but the general state of health has remained the same.

107
00:20:16,677 --> 00:20:20,552
There is no real improvement.

108
00:20:20,656 --> 00:20:38,021
And the real improvement, as you know, starts when you have the laws of cure applied in this person.

109
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:42,594
We have some laws, most of
you know these laws.

110
00:20:42,698 --> 00:20:53,146
You have to have the movement of symptomatology towards the physical body,
if it is

111
00:20:53,250 --> 00:21:02,521
a mental-emotional problem they have to be moving into the physical body the symptoms or when the symptoms

112
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:14,635
are in the physical body they have to move outside on the periphery, in the skin and in the mucus membranes.

113
00:21:15,767 --> 00:21:30,542
In order for us to say, we have succeeded in a case, we have to see this movement of symptomatology.

114
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:37,417
The symptomatology has to move from
deeper levels to more peripheral levels.

115
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:45,167
From mental-emotional levels, to physical levels.

116
00:21:53,167 --> 00:22:05,438
So what you are going to see is an examination with the background of knowledge, which is my background of knowledge.

117
00:22:05,542 --> 00:22:16,260
Many times you will not understand why I ask
a question. Many times my students know why George

118
00:22:16,365 --> 00:22:20,396
 is asking now these questions.
He is thinking of Medorrhinum,

119
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,646
  he is thinking of Argentum nitricum most probably.

120
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:31,042
And then the people who are knowledgeable they can follow very well almost all my questions.

121
00:22:32,052 --> 00:22:42,417
Sometimes if the case is really a small remedy, maybe it's difficult, you may not follow it.

122
00:22:42,521 --> 00:22:53,615
But I will explain when I come into the class, I will explain why I have decided on this remedy and not on other remedies.

123
00:22:59,278 --> 00:23:11,567
So it is very important if you want to become professional homeopaths, to learn the Materia Medica properly.

124
00:23:12,167 --> 00:23:19,542
Now this is the big question. What is to
 know the Materia Medica properly?

125
00:23:20,563 --> 00:23:32,354
We have 12 volumes of Allen's M.M., 12 volumes of Hering's M.M.. You can say what the hell you're talking?

126
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:40,323
Are we going to learn 12 volumes
 by heart? It's not possible.

127
00:23:41,365 --> 00:23:51,979
I remember when I had started bringing
 out these ideas of essential features etc.

128
00:23:52,083 --> 00:24:00,792
I remember criticism and groups
 that they were formed against this idea.

129
00:24:00,917 --> 00:24:10,635
One of the group was the Dulcamara group
 or something like that, the Sepia group.

130
00:24:14,233 --> 00:24:24,208
There was a leader and about 10 people,
 the Sepia group. I said, what did you do?

131
00:24:24,917 --> 00:24:30,771
One of my students has been there
 to report to me what they were doing.

132
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:57,438
He said, we went to a kind of pension to stay together, all of us and from the morning till the night, for 3 days

133
00:24:57,542 --> 00:25:07,865
we studied Sepia. How you studied Sepia? Each one took a different Materia Medica and he was bringing

134
00:25:07,969 --> 00:25:14,302
 into the group the information from
 the different Materia Medicas.

135
00:25:15,042 --> 00:25:26,906
For 3 days, they were studying Sepia and
 I said to him, ok what was the conclusion?

136
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:34,313
What are these symptoms that they
 brought out as main symptoms?

137
00:25:34,417 --> 00:25:41,646
You see the answer was that there was no conclusion. They were just symptoms, symptoms,

138
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:47,021
symptoms each one had noted
down thousands of symptoms.

139
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:59,563
And what is the Sepia case? If you go to really understand, to really find out whether the case is Sepia or not, you are lost.

140
00:25:59,615 --> 00:26:09,104
What are the main points which you have
 to have in mind and to remember for Sepia?

141
00:26:09,833 --> 00:26:19,375
If you don't have this, how the hell are you studying Sepia with 3.500 symptoms?

142
00:26:19,479 --> 00:26:27,948
Only Sepia. Sulphur has 5.000. It'a total loss.

143
00:26:28,458 --> 00:26:38,646
And now the problem is who is going to
 tell you what are the main symptoms?

144
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:48,552
If somebody who is not knowledgeable, he tries to teach Materia Medica, as many times it has happened,

145
00:26:48,656 --> 00:26:50,979
what he is going to tell you?

146
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:58,792
He is going to read the Materia Medica just before the lecture and bring out all the symptoms of Sepia

147
00:26:58,896 --> 00:27:02,417
and you are confused as much as he is.

148
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:09,354
The only person who can really teach
you, is a person who has experience.

149
00:27:09,458 --> 00:27:18,833
Not only who has experience but whose experience has been proven to be effective.

150
00:27:19,667 --> 00:27:30,771
That means you have effect; so you have to get this knowledge from a teacher who knows what he is talking about.

151
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:50,302
Otherwise you will be confused. One teacher says this, the other says that and then it starts the whole fantasy.

152
00:27:52,542 --> 00:27:58,750
I will give you a lecture about fantasy
 because it is a very interesting subject.

153
00:28:03,417 --> 00:28:21,813
You can fantasize anything. You feel this field of Homeopathy, because it concerns human beings who are not static

154
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:33,611
and are alive entities, you can apply any
 possible theory or idea upon them.

155
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:44,906
The problem is all these fantasies, whether you teach in a class, when you go to your practice

156
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:48,792
can you put them into practice
and can they have an effect?

157
00:28:48,896 --> 00:29:01,198
This is the problem. So it depends who
you listen to as a teacher in order to say,

158
00:29:01,302 --> 00:29:03,841
yes I understand now Homeopathy.

159
00:29:03,945 --> 00:29:14,365
The problem of Homeopathy is that we don't have a University. We don't have standardized information.

160
00:29:15,167 --> 00:29:25,729
Anybody can become a teacher, anybody can say whatever he likes and anybody can listen to everybody and say,

161
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:35,188
oh well George why don't we let things just
fly like this?Something will happen one day.

162
00:29:35,292 --> 00:29:43,854
No, nothing will happen one day. It will be more confusion and more confusion and more confusion

163
00:29:43,958 --> 00:29:49,510
and finally people will be disappointed
 and give up Homeopathy.

164
00:29:49,615 --> 00:29:54,333
This is what is going to happen, nothing else.

165
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:24,875
I think that you must be tolerant when you listen to taking of a case and to be observant only.

166
00:30:26,167 --> 00:30:32,854
Try to understand what I'm
doing when I'm taking a case.

167
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:47,656
Otherwise if you have your own ideas applied during the taking of the case, you will miss completely the point.

168
00:30:53,615 --> 00:31:10,750
In such groups I had an American guy who after the analysis of the case would go around and say, George is wrong,

169
00:31:10,854 --> 00:31:28,354
the remedy is this. When the patient comes back and gives the results, then he shuts up of course.

170
00:31:28,458 --> 00:31:36,188
He doesn't say anything but by the time you take the case, he says George is wrong. I know the remedy.

171
00:31:39,281 --> 00:31:51,896
Who was in my lectures in Celle in Germany? Do you remember a French guy, medical doctor?

172
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,844
There were 3 people from France.

173
00:31:54,948 --> 00:32:04,594
One of them was a medical doctor who said that he could find the remedy through an antenna.

174
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:15,948
From a car. He had taken the antenna, the radio antenna from his car, pulls the antenna and

175
00:32:16,052 --> 00:32:19,707
 I prescribe a remedy and then
some people come and say,

176
00:32:19,811 --> 00:32:27,771
you know the French guy is telling everybody that George is wrong, the remedy is wrong.

177
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:32,104
You see, I can find the
remedy with the antenna.

178
00:32:32,208 --> 00:32:41,906
I said, it's very interesting and what was
 the remedy he gave for this case?

179
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:50,063
He says, Veratrum Album and what he gave to the other guy? The remedy is Veratrum Album.

180
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:56,635
About 80% of the cases were Veratrum Album.

181
00:32:57,417 --> 00:33:08,542
I said, very interesting. I want
to see how you find the remedy.

182
00:33:09,167 --> 00:33:17,125
So we prepare all the scenery, we put all the remedies on a table, he pulls the antenna

183
00:33:17,229 --> 00:33:23,333
to find the remedy, he goes like this.

184
00:33:23,875 --> 00:33:34,417
And then he goes over the remedies,
 this is your remedy. I look, Veratrum Album.

185
00:33:35,542 --> 00:33:44,417
I said, now I have a very difficult case.
 Can you help me with this case?

186
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:50,656
Veratrum album. I said, thank you very much.

187
00:33:54,635 --> 00:34:13,823
I thought the guy is not balanced. Next year I think I was going every 6 months in Celle, if I remember well,

188
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:25,646
every 6 months I was returning. The next 6 months I see the two women doctors and not the other medical doctor.

189
00:34:27,542 --> 00:34:36,792
I said, what happened? Why he did not come, the Veratrum? She says, he is in a mental asylum.

190
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:52,375
They closed him down. I said, poor guy, we were trying to help him with Homeopathy. It was not possible and they locked him.

191
00:34:54,333 --> 00:35:06,823
All these are really sad events which are happening in homeopathic community.

192
00:35:06,927 --> 00:35:16,198
And you have to be very aware and very pragmatic, you see you are interested to practice Homeopathy,

193
00:35:16,302 --> 00:35:22,375
you are interested to have results.
You'd better don't fly in the skies.

194
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:35,146
 We have a science which is proving a remedy, get information from the provings, apply it to the person,

195
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:42,333
see the results what you have done after
 the application, make your observations etc.

196
00:35:44,365 --> 00:35:57,615
All the other theories, you see when I hear
 some other teacher from Holland saying,

197
00:35:57,719 --> 00:36:03,063
 actually we don't have to prove
the remedies. What you have to do?

198
00:36:03,167 --> 00:36:17,125
  It's just to meditate and through imagination, understand what possible symptomatology can be created by this remedy.

199
00:36:17,833 --> 00:36:28,573
I said, are you in your mind when you say that?
No George you are narrow minded, you are old, you are this, you are that.

200
00:36:28,677 --> 00:36:38,906
But don't you understand that if you say that
 to a class, I give you a remedy and I say,

201
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:43,948
 imagine the possible symptomatology of this remedy.

202
00:36:44,052 --> 00:36:51,567
There are 130 people in the class, it will be 130 provings. Each one will have his own imagination.

203
00:36:52,365 --> 00:36:57,156
And he will give his own version of the
remedy, don't you understand that?

204
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:02,177
No, you are narrow minded,
you don't understand.

205
00:37:02,281 --> 00:37:21,667
And all kinds of nonsense which have caused the English press to attack very viciously and I had to write an article.

206
00:37:23,969 --> 00:37:28,833
Some of you, do you know
this article on Homeopathy?

207
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:40,896
Who has read the article? Only few. I think it is good you read this article because you may discover

208
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:48,542
 you don't know things which are going on in Homeopathy which are real nonsense.

209
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:21,969
Is anybody wants to ask some question?

210
00:38:26,344 --> 00:38:40,104
Concerning the taking of the case?
Who has listened to this idea that you must allow the patient

211
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:49,875
 to speak and to say the whole story?
Who has listened to this idea originally?

212
00:38:50,927 --> 00:38:56,323
-It's in the Organon.
-It's in the Organon, very good.

213
00:39:01,417 --> 00:39:12,958
The Organon was written in a time when we did not have so many psychotic patients as we have today.

214
00:39:15,208 --> 00:39:28,240
Not only that, I will tell you. I remember a case.
 I was taking a case and at a certain moment,

215
00:39:28,344 --> 00:39:34,823
she had a problem with her mother.
And she started crying and saying

216
00:39:34,927 --> 00:39:46,021
 all these conditions etc. For half an hour
I let her talk, bring out all the grief etc.

217
00:39:51,125 --> 00:40:00,458
So I said, that's enough. You answer my questions now. 1,2,3,4 questions.

218
00:40:02,302 --> 00:40:18,521
I finish the case, I enter the class. There are two women, one she gets up, she says, George I'm really angry

219
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:27,083
because I know you are patient, you are treating the patients very nicely and in this woman you have been

220
00:40:27,188 --> 00:40:34,021
very hard and harsh. Why you did that?

221
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:42,479
And then somebody else comes and says, I accuse you for that. I say, ok hands up.

222
00:40:43,771 --> 00:40:56,104
But if I let this patient talk for 3 hours, I will never in the end be able to find the remedy for this patient.

223
00:40:56,208 --> 00:41:06,438
And the patient will not be cured. It was very interesting that she, herself, that was very much offended

224
00:41:06,542 --> 00:41:16,594
by the way I took the case. After 6 months that she was back, she said I am much better.

225
00:41:16,906 --> 00:41:23,729
Because I have found the remedy, of course.
 It doesn't matter because usually they tell us,

226
00:41:23,833 --> 00:41:33,667
 you treat your patient so nicely and you pat them in the back and they have the placebo effect.

227
00:41:35,875 --> 00:41:46,229
Well, many times I have treated patients very abruptly because I'm anxious to get the real information,

228
00:41:46,333 --> 00:41:51,396
 what is behind of what they tell me. I understand you have a problem with your mother, I understand.

229
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,219
 She has offended you, she has put you down etc. I understand all that, I don't need any more details.

230
00:41:53,323 --> 00:42:01,906
You had problems with your mother and I understand that, I don't need more information.

231
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:12,771
And I went into the house of my mother and my mother was lying in a sofa and her feet were out of the blankets

232
00:42:12,875 --> 00:42:19,885
and I tried to cover the feet with
 the blankets and bla, bla, bla.

233
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:32,510
And I said, no. The whole class will go out because you can't stand it, I mean I can stand quite a lot.

234
00:42:32,615 --> 00:42:46,729
The students can stand so far. You cannot ask them to wait to listen to all this kind of details

235
00:42:46,833 --> 00:42:51,083
which are irrelevant of the real case.

236
00:42:54,948 --> 00:42:59,604
Do you have any questions? You don't have questions. You are afraid of asking questions.

237
00:42:59,708 --> 00:43:09,063
In the beginning everybody is afraid, is calculating if he is going to give me a bad time.

238
00:43:10,563 --> 00:43:22,688
No. You can ask any question. You can say, dear sir in the Organon Hahnemann says let the patient talk etc. etc.

239
00:43:24,521 --> 00:43:39,063
Yes, the patient by that time of Hahnemann would say, I have a pain in my elbow and my left knee is also painful

240
00:43:39,167 --> 00:43:53,021
and Hahnemann would write Agaricus.
 Because of what? The diagonal picture.

241
00:43:53,125 --> 00:44:04,313
But if somebody comes today and relates to
 you a case of Agaricus will be totally different.

242
00:44:04,417 --> 00:44:20,021
I tell you, if you don't know the mental picture
 of Agaricus and the total anxiety and fear he creates about death

243
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:29,552
and dying, especially with cancer.
Cancer is the word they cannot pronounce.

244
00:44:29,656 --> 00:44:40,396
Usually Agaricus case will say for
 cancer, 'you know they died from that.

245
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:48,375
He died from this'. 'What is this?'
 'You know'. 'No, I don't know'.

246
00:44:48,521 --> 00:44:52,021
You cannot make them
pronounce the word cancer.

247
00:44:52,125 --> 00:44:59,792
The pronouncing of the word cancer is impossible for such a case, Agaricus.

248
00:45:01,146 --> 00:45:08,646
So little details like that. When you push somebody to tell you the word of cancer,

249
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:16,354
it points out to the core, to the inside
 information from the patient.

250
00:45:16,458 --> 00:45:30,260
You may ask a direct question,
 whether he is afraid of cancer.

251
00:45:30,365 --> 00:45:41,646
You will get an answer like mm....
you will not get a straight forward answer.

252
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:51,729
But you have to have the picture in your mind of how Agaricus is reacting to the idea of cancer.

253
00:45:51,833 --> 00:46:01,563
To understand the tremendous fear which is going on in the person and the anxiety.

254
00:46:03,656 --> 00:46:14,688
Unless you know that kind of picture, let the patient of Agaricus talk to you now.

255
00:46:14,792 --> 00:46:31,000
He will talk and talk, talk, talk . Another thing I've observed with Agaricus is that they think that

256
00:46:31,104 --> 00:46:36,365
all people around them are dying from cancer.

257
00:46:36,878 --> 00:46:43,458
Why? Because you hear somebody has died from cancer and the other day you forgot.

258
00:46:43,563 --> 00:46:50,418
It seems that the idea that this person has died from cancer, you say it's your relative? No.

259
00:46:50,522 --> 00:47:03,729
It's your friend? No. Who is? But I have a friend whose friend was 42 and died from cancer.

260
00:47:03,833 --> 00:47:11,438
And it has stayed in the mind so powerful
that overwhelms the individual.

261
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:17,927
So that is the anxiety of Agaricus, that kind.

262
00:47:18,031 --> 00:47:26,927
When you see that kind, you see the details how it is expressed this anxiety, then you have to know,

263
00:47:27,031 --> 00:47:34,594
 somebody must have told you. He must have described to you the anxiety of Agaricus to be able

264
00:47:34,698 --> 00:47:43,375
 immediately to say, I don't want anymore, now
 I can ask you some practical questions.

265
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:03,063
- The cases we see you take here are very
often people who know about Homeopathy

266
00:48:03,167 --> 00:48:08,271
 and they've seen homeopaths before.
They know what to expect.

267
00:48:08,375 --> 00:48:15,417
 We see or I see many people in England who have wrong ideas about Homeopathy,

268
00:48:15,521 --> 00:48:22,021
 they are not sure. What would you say to these people at the first appointment, about Homeopathy

269
00:48:22,125 --> 00:48:28,365
and the process of treatment to ensure
 that they stay with Homeopathy.

270
00:48:31,417 --> 00:48:37,990
-That is a good question.
The answer is, I don't know.

271
00:48:42,583 --> 00:48:54,104
Why I say that? Because first of all
these are English people, not Greeks.

272
00:48:57,811 --> 00:49:07,354
With Greeks you don't have to explain. He
 comes to be treated by you, he sits down there.

273
00:49:08,854 --> 00:49:16,219
He has come because he has listened to 10 other people who go to George, I have been cured, I have been cured.

274
00:49:16,323 --> 00:49:22,354
They sit there, they are trembling.
Whatever I want to ask, I will ask.

275
00:49:23,323 --> 00:49:38,354
English people are much more investigative, much more complicated in their mind they have
 a mind which is

276
00:49:38,458 --> 00:49:45,490
 much more complicated and they can think
3 different aspects at the same time.

277
00:49:48,438 --> 00:50:01,281
Such people you have to deal according to your race. You see I cannot give you advice for a person

278
00:50:01,385 --> 00:50:11,281
who comes with a lot of doubts in Homeopathy.
If you say, I will cure you, it is absolutely wrong.

279
00:50:11,385 --> 00:50:19,979
If you say, well I don't know, it is absolutely wrong. This is what I know.

280
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:31,104
If you will say, that 'first of all I would like to hear what you have and in the end I can tell you

281
00:50:31,208 --> 00:50:39,104
 whether I can help you or not' the person
 will settle down and will give the story.

282
00:50:39,208 --> 00:50:46,531
Further you can say, 'I'm going to ask some strange questions but we need these questions

283
00:50:46,635 --> 00:50:56,719
in order to find out what is your remedy.  For instance I will ask you whether you like eggs.

284
00:50:59,792 --> 00:51:08,823
 It may appear for you that it's irrelevant but for us it's very important because a desire for eggs means that

285
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:22,240
your organism does not absorb calcium and egg having a lot of calcium, the organism needs this egg.

286
00:51:22,344 --> 00:51:30,417
So the absorption of calcium is very important for your organism and that's why you have osteoporosis'.

287
00:51:31,719 --> 00:51:41,542
If the age allows you to make the prediction also. So he says, 'oh, this doctor knows everything'.

288
00:51:42,278 --> 00:51:50,563
But this kind of approach I think for the English people. For Greeks you don't need to do anything.

289
00:51:53,031 --> 00:52:02,823
But for English people you explain to them that if I ask you if you take your feet our of covers, for instance?

290
00:52:02,927 --> 00:52:09,313
Oh yes my feet I take out of cover.
Number 1 symptom you put it down.

291
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:20,021
But you explain to them that it has been researched and found out that the temperature

292
00:52:20,125 --> 00:52:32,333
regulator of the body is the big toe. The big
 toe regulates the temperature of the body.

293
00:52:32,438 --> 00:52:40,021
 If the temperature of the body rises beyond
 a certain limit, then people have to

294
00:52:40,125 --> 00:52:48,208
stick out their feet to cool down the
 temperature of the body.

295
00:52:49,479 --> 00:53:01,417
So you bring some examples of this type but never promise to anybody that 'I will cure you'.

296
00:53:02,167 --> 00:53:07,854
That is rule number 1.
Never promise 'I will cure you'.

297
00:53:07,958 --> 00:53:22,531
Of course sometimes you find a case in which the anxiety is totally overwhelming and at a certain time

298
00:53:22,635 --> 00:53:32,969
the patient calls you on the telephone, in a panic. 'I'm dying, I'm having this, that and I'm dying'.

299
00:53:34,875 --> 00:53:46,996
At this moment you have to be quite strong and say, don't worry I'll give you a remedy and you will be fine etc.

300
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:58,260
 But they're trembling during the panic attack, nothing can peace down such a patient.

301
00:54:00,125 --> 00:54:06,063
If you say with steady voice, don't worry
 I'll give you a remedy and it will help you.

302
00:54:06,083 --> 00:54:11,885
At this moment you are allowed to do it.
But only at this moment.

303
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:25,396
Because these persons are usually lead to the emergency room and they will put some injections

304
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:37,896
with valium or things like that and sedate the patient. You see, you don't want that, you want
 to continue.

305
00:54:39,677 --> 00:54:53,417
Some times during a treatment you had given wrong remedies, 1, 2 remedies wrong and then suddenly

306
00:54:53,521 --> 00:55:06,646
you see the full picture of an anxiety remedy. Like Arsenicum, like Phosphorus, like Agaricus, like Nitric Acid etc.

307
00:55:10,583 --> 00:55:19,917
Then you prescribe the remedy and the person really after that time starts to be better.

308
00:55:20,792 --> 00:55:32,667
And he comes after 3 years, because people with such deep disturbances where mentally

309
00:55:32,771 --> 00:55:42,615
have been affected so deeply, it takes years before you manage to bring them around,

310
00:55:42,719 --> 00:55:53,688
 to make them feel ok now I can stand on my feet. I was flying in the air, I was in a different world.

311
00:55:53,792 --> 00:56:07,177
But finally when they say, I'm centred again,
 they use such words, I'm on my foot.

312
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:13,938
When you hear these expressions and you ask them, do you remember how you were? Yes.

313
00:56:14,042 --> 00:56:24,021
How are you now? Yes I remember. This means that your treatment was really successful.

314
00:56:24,125 --> 00:56:30,698
I don't know, I answered your point? Not really.

315
00:56:33,875 --> 00:56:47,438
-Yes but I have to tell them a little bit more about the process of treatment and I wonder how much

316
00:56:47,542 --> 00:56:48,979
you would tell them at the start?

317
00:56:49,083 --> 00:56:58,729
-At the start I would not talk about high potency, energy remedies, nothing about these matters

318
00:56:58,833 --> 00:57:12,188
which are not clear and known. You have to bring examples of known facts. It is known that soft boiled eggs

319
00:57:12,292 --> 00:57:23,438
contain a lot of calcium that absorbs easily.
I know that the feet are the regulator of the temperature of the body.

320
00:57:23,542 --> 00:57:31,885
These are written facts and I'm using these in order to understand how your organism is working.

321
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:43,010
And if I can find your remedy, maybe
you will feel better. It's very good.

322
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:50,500
You don't take the authority, I'm the doctor and you are the patient and I know everything.

323
00:57:51,323 --> 00:57:53,792
-What do you say to them about
possible aggravation?

324
00:57:53,896 --> 00:58:01,042
That is another very good question.
You're asking very good questions.

325
00:58:01,146 --> 00:58:09,688
You see, in my experience when I had an aggravation from a remedy and the person

326
00:58:09,792 --> 00:58:19,396
 calls me on the telephone and gives me immediately I understand this is not something else,

327
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:26,813
 it is an aggravation from the remedy, my first word is excellent.

328
00:58:26,917 --> 00:58:33,156
Very good. Very good? Yes it's very good, excellent.

329
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:39,323
We're expecting this aggravation,
 in a few days you will feel fine.

330
00:58:40,188 --> 00:58:51,938
Immediately the anxiety, the fear goes down and they wait for a few days. And when comes the period

331
00:58:52,042 --> 00:59:02,041
of amelioration they come back and say 'you saved my life'. You have all that experience.

332
00:59:02,145 --> 00:59:15,938
But if you have given 2,3 wrong remedies in 3 months and the 4th month he telephones in a panic attack

333
00:59:16,042 --> 00:59:24,125
and you think that the panic attack is an aggravation from the remedy and you tell him very good

334
00:59:24,229 --> 00:59:35,563
for the panic attack keep your panic attack, you will search the patient and you will find him in the emergency room.

335
00:59:36,292 --> 00:59:47,354
That's for sure, they cannot tolerate. At this moment they need, in order the organism to tolerate the impact,

336
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:53,833
 the tremendous impact of the fear
 they need reassurance.

337
00:59:55,417 --> 01:00:02,229
You say, don't worry I'll give
you a remedy, your panic will go.

338
01:00:08,333 --> 01:00:16,278
-I'm from South Africa, if you don't understand
 my accent I'll speak slowly.

339
01:00:19,292 --> 01:00:22,198
-Yes if you speak slowly and clearly
everybody will understand.

340
01:00:22,302 --> 01:00:34,000
-Some homeopaths that I have spoken to, say that if you give a person the wrong remedy it will do nothing.

341
01:00:34,104 --> 01:00:39,885
And they give them wrong remedy after wrong remedy and they say, it's fine, when you get

342
01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:45,698
the right one you fix them up.
Can you comment on that?

343
01:00:47,281 --> 01:00:54,521
-Well I'll tell you something. From this
 point of view which is in a way correct,

344
01:00:54,625 --> 01:01:01,865
many times you give remedies they have no effect. On the other hand, come the people

345
01:01:01,969 --> 01:01:12,552
who suppose to do the provings and with one dose of 30 they have created 1000 symptoms.

346
01:01:12,656 --> 01:01:19,906
So there are two extremes which are not correct. The truth is in the middle.

347
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:28,646
Sometimes the wrong remedy will have a partial effect. Sometimes the wrong remedy will give you

348
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:32,438
a proving or 1-2 proving symptoms.

349
01:01:32,542 --> 01:01:39,667
Most of the times the wrong remedy will
have no effect. But sometimes is this or that.

350
01:01:40,281 --> 01:01:53,906
But neither is going to create a host of symptoms like Jeremy ...or a host of imaginary.

351
01:01:55,792 --> 01:02:05,208
Don't forget always you have to take into consideration the human factor of self suggestion.

352
01:02:06,792 --> 01:02:14,240
You have to be very critical about that point. Because the moment you have given a remedy

353
01:02:14,344 --> 01:02:24,917
and the patient comes and says: 'I have a
lot of symptoms because of your remedy'.

354
01:02:27,563 --> 01:02:36,604
Usually a mental case will attribute all her symptoms into the remedy you gave.

355
01:02:36,708 --> 01:02:45,573
And you have to know that this is a self suggestion; it is not because of the remedy.

356
01:02:45,677 --> 01:02:57,322
Because if you write down all the remedies that the patient is relating to you because of the remedy, then you are lost.

357
01:02:57,500 --> 01:03:03,333
But neither you can say, ok take another
 remedy, another remedy, 100 remedies.

358
01:03:03,438 --> 01:03:11,948
I had a few cases here that they have taken more than 100 remedies from the Materia Medica.

359
01:03:12,052 --> 01:03:20,688
When they come here; still I manage in
 a way to find a way out. Very difficult.

360
01:03:20,792 --> 01:03:24,281
Because the case is really confused.

361
01:03:24,385 --> 01:03:29,156
It is not so simple. You know, it's not
 going to do anything.

362
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:36,969
No, it can change the symptomatology
and confuse the case.

363
01:03:38,031 --> 01:03:45,823
-I need to get a clarification. When I listen to mental symptoms normally the patients

364
01:03:45,927 --> 01:03:49,188
are not comfortable during the first visit.

365
01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:56,979
-Especially if they are Indians.
-Indians. I come from South India

366
01:03:57,083 --> 01:04:08,771
and they are very unsure, why we are asking a mental question. So maybe it's during the 2nd or the 3rd visit

367
01:04:08,875 --> 01:04:12,929
that they open up on the mental features. So what is the approach that we have to take in such a case?

368
01:04:17,208 --> 01:04:26,313
 We might have prescribed after the first visit not knowing that there is more to come? What is the best thing to do at this point?

369
01:04:26,417 --> 01:04:36,521
-It is true when I was in India I had faced this problem. Because you are examining a woman and you are asking,

370
01:04:36,625 --> 01:04:52,542
are you good in sex? She will leave
 immediately. What are you talking about?

371
01:04:53,583 --> 01:04:59,229
Unbelievable for an Indian woman
to answer such questions.

372
01:05:04,229 --> 01:05:15,104
The good thing is that Indians on the whole are much more healthy than the Europeans or the Americans.

373
01:05:15,208 --> 01:05:21,563
And therefore very few really
have mental symptomatology.

374
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:27,927
So mostly the symptomatology is physical and therefore you can base your prescription

375
01:05:28,031 --> 01:05:30,438
on physical symptomatology.

376
01:05:30,542 --> 01:05:40,100
But if by chance, there is anybody who might have panic attacks, he will tell you.

377
01:05:40,989 --> 01:05:54,729
But don't ask them about sex. About menses?To that point you can go, are you regular? Regular, regular.

378
01:05:54,833 --> 01:06:00,854
What do you mean by regular? Normal, normal.

379
01:06:00,958 --> 01:06:17,208
But if you want to confirm whether a patient is Platina or Sepia, forget it. It's normal, normal.

380
01:06:24,417 --> 01:06:35,938
I always defend India, as you know. India is
 an amazing race which has kept ethics

381
01:06:36,042 --> 01:06:54,000
in their emotional contacts so strongly that it is to their advantage today that their marriages are staying.

382
01:06:54,104 --> 01:07:06,375
Very few divorces, I don't know the last years. By the time of 60's when I was in India, divorce was unthinkable. Why?

383
01:07:06,479 --> 01:07:17,255
Because the man and the girl come for the
 first time in sexual contact after marriage.

384
01:07:17,417 --> 01:07:34,438
That is the ideal for keeping a marriage. If one of the two has a lot of experiences, usually the men have a lot of experiences,

385
01:07:34,542 --> 01:07:39,396
the woman may suffer that the man will look around.

386
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:51,771
But if they come together, even the parents arrange marriage, the marriage will stay and they will enjoy sex.

387
01:07:54,708 --> 01:08:00,104
You think, ah they are enjoying?
 They are enjoying really.

388
01:08:00,208 --> 01:08:15,667
Where you ask the European or the American people that have started having sex at 12, 13, 14,

389
01:08:15,771 --> 01:08:21,107
what the hell can they feel at this age?
They can feel nothing.

390
01:08:21,211 --> 01:08:27,823
 They don't wait to become a woman and then you marry and you enjoy it the rest of your life.

391
01:08:27,927 --> 01:08:36,562
You enjoy 1,2,3, 5, times, 20 times, 100 times.
And after that you are dead, you are not interested.

392
01:08:36,667 --> 01:08:46,646
You cannot feel anything. Oh it's the same thing. Whether there is this one or that one, it doesn't matter.

393
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:51,531
Then let's try some other deviations.

394
01:08:54,052 --> 01:09:11,354
You see Indian people like South American races are much more keeping to the culture and to the ethics.

395
01:09:11,458 --> 01:09:17,927
We have destroyed everything, all the values, nothing.

396
01:09:20,208 --> 01:09:25,552
You know my ideas. I'm not religious person, right?

397
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:39,510
I appreciate all religions but what I told you, what I teach is experience and how people can become happy.

398
01:09:43,896 --> 01:09:53,625
Unfortunately we have overused this area.

399
01:09:55,969 --> 01:10:07,655
- Could you please tell us something from your experience about fast acting remedies or slow acting remedies.

400
01:10:10,542 --> 01:10:19,979
-According to my experience there are no fast acting remedies or slow acting remedies.

401
01:10:20,083 --> 01:10:27,240
There is no such a thing. There is no such a thing as acute remedies and chronic remedies.

402
01:10:29,667 --> 01:10:40,302
The only thing that exist is, if the remedy is indicated will act fast; if the remedy is not indicated

403
01:10:40,406 --> 01:10:44,656
you think, it will take time etc. etc.

404
01:10:46,125 --> 01:10:55,667
It's not because of the remedy that you may see a delayed reaction but because of the organism.

405
01:10:55,771 --> 01:11:04,594
If the organism is weakened his
 reaction will be a little bit delayed.

406
01:11:04,698 --> 01:11:14,906
But not because of the remedy. I told you
I have seen cases with Aconitum where it was

407
01:11:15,010 --> 01:11:19,813
considered as a remedy good for
 common colds and I have given it

408
01:11:19,917 --> 01:11:35,885
to very deep psychological trauma, fear that manifested at a certain point and lasted for 10 years.

409
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:41,552
And you give Aconite and the person feels free.

410
01:11:41,656 --> 01:11:53,021
And then you see the next remedy of course, because in such a case of what we call small remedies

411
01:11:53,125 --> 01:12:06,792
the idea is that you free the organism from a level of health, a level of remedy

412
01:12:06,896 --> 01:12:14,615
you free it and the underlying pathology is manifesting more clearly.

413
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:22,177
You take out the effect of tremendous fear.

414
01:12:22,281 --> 01:12:32,313
We had an earthqueake here in Greece and most of the houses are down.

415
01:12:32,417 --> 01:12:43,167
These people, some of them, they will get a trauma because of the earthquake that will last all their life.

416
01:12:43,479 --> 01:12:54,396
Now if you try to cure such a person and you take Calcarea Carbonica, you give it no effect or little effect.

417
01:12:54,500 --> 01:13:04,896
Or Lycopodium, little effect. And then you go down to the trauma where she describes and she says

418
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:16,312
when I hear the word "earthquake" it makes me tremble. It's either Aconite or Gelsenium or Stramonium or Opium.

419
01:13:16,417 --> 01:13:25,219
You give one of these remedies and then Calcarea Carbonica is coming again, beautiful now.

420
01:13:25,323 --> 01:13:34,646
Now I can give you the Calcarea Carbonica. Because it has been printed upon the organism.

421
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:44,229
Like an imprint of the traumatic experience, whatever it might have been and the remedy

422
01:13:44,333 --> 01:13:55,500
has to be targeted towards this uppermost layer which is waiting for you to recognise it and to give the remedy.

423
01:14:01,813 --> 01:14:09,411
-You said that when you're taking a case after about the first or the second question, you come to an idea about the remedy.

424
01:14:10,278 --> 01:14:20,929
Is that the information about the patient?

425
01:14:47,417 --> 01:14:57,909
-Have in mind that I never see the cases beforehand. I don't want to know anything that you don't know.

426
01:14:58,014 --> 01:15:06,354
So therefore I don't know what is written there and when I start taking the case, I am at the same position as you are.

427
01:15:06,458 --> 01:15:11,729
I have not studied before the case so I don't know what you're talking about in this case.

428
01:15:11,833 --> 01:15:16,156
-I just wondered if you set out the questionnaire before the person came.

429
01:15:17,594 --> 01:15:29,104
-No, no. You are asking whether it is good to have a questionnaire filled by the patient before you see him?

430
01:15:29,208 --> 01:15:36,219
-Yes.
-No, I don't think this is a good practice.

431
01:15:38,229 --> 01:15:46,771
Because it can give you false impressions.
 That means main points can be lost.

432
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:52,510
Because the patient does not realise that his main point is his fear of cancer.

433
01:15:52,896 --> 01:16:01,646
He thinks that the pain he has in the right hypochondrium is the problem. If the pain goes away, then I have no cancer.

434
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:10,729
But he does not tell you 'I'm terrified with the idea that I have cancer because I have a pain in the right hypochondrium'.

435
01:16:10,833 --> 01:16:16,542
So you miss the case if you do this.

436
01:16:41,854 --> 01:16:45,417
-I would like to say something about
patients coming for the first time.

437
01:16:45,521 --> 01:16:51,146
I know that most of them are doubteful whether Homeopathy is the right therapy for them.

438
01:16:51,250 --> 01:17:01,354
I want them to read the book "medicine of a new man" before they come, so all of them know what is important

439
01:17:01,458 --> 01:17:06,104
for a homeopath to know and even in
the first interview, most of them tell me

440
01:17:06,208 --> 01:17:10,531
what I'm telling you now
I never told anybody before.

441
01:17:10,635 --> 01:17:15,104
-Because they have been informed.
-Yes, I think that's a good way.

442
01:17:15,208 --> 01:17:18,771
-I also think it's a good idea.

443
01:17:27,365 --> 01:17:35,146
-I practice in London and this is what I actually do. To all my patients I give one of your books and I insist they read it.

444
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:43,646
And not to come if they don't have read it. I used to give one each because they used to be 20 pence those days

445
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:49,260
but now I just lend them and
 I ask them to bring it back.

446
01:17:50,698 --> 01:18:02,125
-Thank you. I have one of my books printed by an important publisher in Greece, a new book I wrote about

447
01:18:02,229 --> 01:18:09,375
the information 'Basic ideas of Homeopathy' which is translated into English now and it will come out soon.

448
01:18:09,479 --> 01:18:24,927
It will be shorter than the New Millenium and quite informative. In this book I write also an idea

449
01:18:25,031 --> 01:18:30,646
which I did not want to speak publically, before.

450
01:18:34,542 --> 01:18:40,031
Now I think it's time that we say everything.

451
01:18:40,875 --> 01:18:50,354
What I say in this book is, and I give some examples, that our social behavior

452
01:18:50,458 --> 01:19:06,278
our sexual behavior, our behavior in general is directly related to our pathology.

453
01:19:08,875 --> 01:19:14,789
That means you are a character, they call you this, this or that and it's because of your hormones.

454
01:19:15,302 --> 01:19:26,354
It's because of your pathology, because of your stomach not working properly that you behave in this or that way.

455
01:19:26,458 --> 01:19:38,354
The society today has to understand that unless we are able to find a system that brings back

456
01:19:38,458 --> 01:19:45,104
balance to the whole organism,
the society will go from bad to worse.

457
01:19:45,656 --> 01:19:52,125
And we have a violent society,
we don't know why.

458
01:19:52,854 --> 01:20:02,490
People become violent and if you ask them really why, they will admit they don't know exactly.

459
01:20:02,594 --> 01:20:10,811
It's something inside me, you know like the Causticum, Argentum Nitricum, impulsive people.

460
01:20:11,667 --> 01:20:20,063
They want to throw a bomb to the government and go to the government building and blow it all up because

461
01:20:20,167 --> 01:20:25,854
of unequality, because of injustice, because of this or because of that.

462
01:20:27,458 --> 01:20:38,823
In the same way when the child takes a gun and kills all his class mates. A child of 10 years old takes a gun and kills.

463
01:20:38,927 --> 01:20:46,490
What is this? Nobody says the child is sick.

464
01:20:46,594 --> 01:21:02,367
And we, as a society, should be able to detect his problem before he reaches that point of killing.

465
01:21:03,042 --> 01:21:13,708
And not only to detect it but to have a way of eliminating this problem with the child.

466
01:21:15,375 --> 01:21:25,174
You can understand how important Homeopathy becomes more and more, especially for Europeans and Americans.

467
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:34,146
It becomes more and more important. The danger is not so much with South Americans and with Indians,

468
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:43,875
people more balanced who
still keep the morals of a society.

469
01:21:44,917 --> 01:21:58,667
Once the morals are breaking down, we have broken a barrier within us, a barrier which is brought about

470
01:21:58,771 --> 01:22:04,594
by what we call as our conscience.

471
01:22:05,365 --> 01:22:18,823
Once we make concessions about our conscience, 'it doesn't matter', then we broke the barrier.

472
01:22:18,927 --> 01:22:30,979
And once the barrier is broken, then all hell
 gets loose. We don't have a point to stop us.

473
01:22:31,083 --> 01:22:40,655
See how important it is. I wrote an article about conscience and consciousness and the difference and what it means.

474
01:22:41,323 --> 01:22:47,219
Maybe I will translate it into English.
I wrote it for a journal.

475
01:22:47,323 --> 01:23:00,104
But I can tell you this: that once you make a concession with your conscience, there is no
 way back.

476
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:06,125
All hell will get loose. Anything goes.

477
01:23:07,542 --> 01:23:27,813
We had a case recently of a homosexual.
Very famous man. Actor.

478
01:23:28,989 --> 01:23:37,813
Because Greece has famous people
 only actors. Nobody else is famous.

479
01:23:41,967 --> 01:23:52,417
He was going out every night, getting a young boy, having whatever having, making a deal, you do this,

480
01:23:52,521 --> 01:24:02,062
 you do that, I give you so much. In the end
he says, you don't get anything from me,

481
01:24:02,167 --> 01:24:07,615
he goes to the kitchen takes a knife and kills him.

482
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:19,729
This man he must have been living in a hell because the barriers have been broken down.

483
01:24:19,833 --> 01:24:28,688
Finished, nothing could stop him. He would go openly because everybody knew what he was doing.

484
01:24:28,792 --> 01:24:40,687
He was not doing it even in secret, I'm famous I can do whatever I like. Go to the market, get somebody.

485
01:24:40,792 --> 01:24:44,771
Ok I pay you so much, you do this.

486
01:24:49,302 --> 01:24:55,729
I remember I had seen him and I said,
 this man is Tarentula.

487
01:24:55,833 --> 01:25:03,646
If he had got Tarentula, he was so much
 in a hurry whatever he was doing.

488
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:21,729
A state of anxiety you could see it, restlessness.
I said Tarentula. If he had taken Tarentula maybe his hormonal system

489
01:25:21,833 --> 01:25:34,344
that was driving him to have so frequently these kind of experiences, could have come down, reduced.

490
01:25:37,583 --> 01:25:43,052
You see the importance of Homeopathy?
 It's tremendous, it's unbelievable.

491
01:25:44,458 --> 01:25:51,417
But at the same time because it is so
 needed, there are so many noises.

492
01:25:51,521 --> 01:25:57,396
You know in a system which is clean,
how the noises can destroy the system?

493
01:25:57,500 --> 01:26:10,583
A lot of noises from the outside and the world
 cannot realise the importance of that system.
