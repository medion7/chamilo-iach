The title of the article is ‘The Continuum of a Unified Theory of Diseases’.

2
00:00:34,236 --> 00:00:46,323
When a person is born and starts having some medical problems

3
00:00:47,347 --> 00:01:01,120
and the newborn child is treated most probably for acute conditions

4
00:01:01,792 --> 00:01:08,944
there are 2 possibilities, after they have been treated,

5
00:01:09,407 --> 00:01:19,000
usually antibiotics or cortisone or chemical drugs, anti-inflammatory depending on the problem

6
00:01:19,336 --> 00:01:28,409
after they have been treated with such heavy chemical drugs the organism has two possibilities;

7
00:01:28,681 --> 00:01:43,032
one is to get rid of the chemicals as well as getting rid of the disease.

8
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:56,362
That’s one possibility that means you give a lot of drugs, the pneumonia subsides

9
00:01:56,834 --> 00:02:06,610
and later on the organism tries to get rid of the effect of the antibiotics or the chemicals.

10
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:24,244
The second possibility is in case the immune system is not strong enough

11
00:02:24,924 --> 00:02:41,863
what is going to happen is subdue the acute condition but the organism does not have the power to get rid of the acute

12
00:02:42,206 --> 00:02:58,077
and what is the best it can do is submit itself to the power of drugs in which case

13
00:02:58,365 --> 00:03:14,012
the acute inflammatory process becomes a sub-acute chronic inflammatory process.

14
00:03:15,772 --> 00:03:33,212
This sub-acute inflammatory process is what we call a chronic degenerative disease.

15
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:43,947
What kind of an inflammation of a chronic degenerative disease

16
00:03:44,235 --> 00:03:54,204
an organism will develop will depend on genetic predisposition.

17
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:07,739
So, if the genetic predisposition is towards a sensitivity on the ears

18
00:04:08,467 --> 00:04:18,762
it will develop ear problems of severe or less severe condition.

19
00:04:19,042 --> 00:04:28,251
If the predisposition is for epilepsy they will develop epilepsy,

20
00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:38,770
if the predisposition is for asthma, especially because

21
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:47,865
the primary inflammation in the children is in the respiratory system

22
00:04:48,209 --> 00:05:00,545
that is why we have so many cases of asthmatic conditions that have been created by suppression

23
00:05:01,105 --> 00:05:21,420
of acute respiratory diseases like bronchitis, pneumonia, pharyngitis, laryngitis,

24
00:05:22,084 --> 00:05:37,524
it can push the disease to deeper sights, the lungs, and then we have the manifestation of chronic asthma.

25
00:05:39,603 --> 00:05:50,019
The idea I was giving in this article was that; unless the organism had the possibility

26
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:58,554
to get rid of the disease and the effect of the drugs then we will definitely

27
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:07,843
have the manifestation of a predisposition of the organism.

28
00:06:08,362 --> 00:06:17,347
That organism can manifest all types of diseases as we call today.

29
00:06:21,986 --> 00:06:30,306
At least most of the times it’s not that the chemical itself will give a problem

30
00:06:30,802 --> 00:06:39,890
but it will trigger the predisposition of the organism.

31
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:49,506
The suppression can create a chronic condition of asthma.

32
00:06:51,386 --> 00:07:00,457
The suppression of severe laryngitis can create asthmatic condition.

33
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:12,064
As you go down to the respiratory system, the bronchi, suppression of the bronchi,

34
00:07:12,344 --> 00:07:19,409
then the disease that will develop will be more and more difficult

35
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:32,672
if the suppression had started from an area in the respiratory system that is deep which is the lung, pneumonia.

36
00:07:33,512 --> 00:07:46,753
Therefore, what I claim in the article is that there is a continuum of diseases

37
00:07:47,064 --> 00:08:07,639
and these diseases acute, chronic or developed by chemical drugs they have a continuum, they are connected with each other.

38
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:21,511
We cannot say he had gonorrhea or syphilis, it’s nothing take some antibiotics and it’s gone.

39
00:08:24,455 --> 00:08:31,134
Unless the organism is very strong in such a case then it’s gone.

40
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:38,263
But how many people have so strong organisms today?

41
00:08:38,966 --> 00:08:49,638
In most of the people the treating of an acute condition, whatever it might be,

42
00:08:49,878 --> 00:09:02,110
is going to leave most probably, its mark and from an acute inflammatory condition becomes a sub-inflammatory process.

43
00:09:02,382 --> 00:09:14,286
That’s why many years ago I have said all diseases are sub-inflammatory processes.

44
00:09:17,365 --> 00:09:25,743
I remember 2 years ago one of my students came and he said

45
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:41,054
“I found this in a medical journal that schizophrenia is an inflammatory process.”

46
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:53,789
Nobody could ever imagine that. There are some inflammations

47
00:09:54,318 --> 00:10:05,294
which are going on either of some proteins or whatever and then they reducing

48
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:12,149
for some time and then the inflammation comes up again and then the crisis comes.

49
00:10:13,173 --> 00:10:26,765
So Medicine in general in its effort to try to subdue acute, epidemic condition

50
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:36,837
they have found ways to suppress and in which case we have the side effects

51
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:51,796
and we have a person who is going in his life but is damaged irreparably in his life

52
00:10:52,676 --> 00:11:06,420
unless the immune system is again stimulated by the right way to bring about the original inflammation.

53
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:15,787
Unless in a case you find again the original inflammation, that means the organism

54
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:27,491
as it was going towards a degeneration after the homeopathic treatment starts a regeneration

55
00:11:28,835 --> 00:11:41,356
and must reach a point where the original acute must reappear.

56
00:11:42,267 --> 00:11:48,546
20-21-22 this is the age they get gonorrhea.

57
00:11:48,899 --> 00:12:10,626
The idea is that either the condition remains as non-specific urethritis that means in the morning there is a discharge.

58
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:25,481
It can go on for years. If the person takes a lot of antibiotics to stop this little discharge

59
00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:35,865
this discharge will manifest in the respiratory and the upper respiratory system especially post-nasally.

60
00:12:36,226 --> 00:12:45,716
If you study the blood picture of a person who had gonorrhea at the age of 20

61
00:12:46,692 --> 00:12:55,035
and he comes now he’s 50-60 and you start looking at his blood you will not find any gonorrhea.

62
00:12:59,251 --> 00:13:15,314
This is transferred to another type of microbe, bacteria, fungus etc.

63
00:13:16,435 --> 00:13:25,003
They have modified the original bacteria.

64
00:13:26,691 --> 00:13:39,789
When we say suppression we do not mean immediately that you will immediately find in a streptococcal pneumonia

65
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:49,452
that in the chronic condition you will find streptococcal infection in the organism.

66
00:13:50,076 --> 00:14:14,172
No. There is no direct line in which you can say he was having a staphylococcal infection on the skin

67
00:14:14,443 --> 00:14:17,844
and now he has a staphylococcal infection in the lungs.

68
00:14:18,372 --> 00:14:22,595
You must not try to do this. The organism works differently.

69
00:14:22,803 --> 00:14:32,724
I will give you an example. Let’s say you have a case of carbuncles

70
00:14:32,947 --> 00:14:36,052
and you start treating with antibiotics.

71
00:14:36,387 --> 00:14:46,298
After 1-2 years they appear again and now you find out that now it’s proteus.

72
00:14:47,106 --> 00:14:54,236
You keep on giving remedies, antibiotics to fight proteus infection

73
00:14:54,892 --> 00:15:03,274
and after a few years you find that it is bacillus pyocyaneus (pseudomonas),

74
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:11,122
much more severe infection that the original staphylococcal infection.

75
00:15:11,315 --> 00:15:22,346
Yet there is one line but you must not try to say now it is bacillus pyocyaneus, it is a different infection.

76
00:15:24,115 --> 00:15:33,674
No! The organism has changed, modified the original staphylococcal infection to proteus

77
00:15:33,985 --> 00:15:44,730
and to pseudomonas and perhaps to new strange which we found now in the hospitals,

78
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:53,305
hospital infections which are resistant to all types of antibiotics we know.

79
00:15:54,745 --> 00:16:00,961
How has this happened? How this new strange microbes have developed?

80
00:16:02,593 --> 00:16:13,328
It doesn’t mean because you find something totally different in the examination now that that’s different.

81
00:16:13,761 --> 00:16:33,967
No. It’s a continuum. And diseases can be considered, each one as a unified thing. It’s not isolated.Now I got this.

82
00:16:37,544 --> 00:16:46,239
No. You got now this condition because of this, this and that you had before.
