1
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:29,156
So the subject on which we are talking about is Objectives.

2
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:35,396
 Through homeopathic treatment where do we take the patient, what are we doing?

3
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:52,510
We are clearing, as much as possible, mental-emotional and then physical, in this order.

4
00:00:52,594 --> 00:01:01,615
First clearing mental, then emotional and then physical.

5
00:01:07,146 --> 00:01:16,000
So we have the idea from up downwards.

6
00:01:18,615 --> 00:01:29,667
We have the idea that the cure should go from Mental, then to Emotional, then to Physical.

7
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:40,667
This is a must in order to say that we are successful in treating a patient.

8
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:51,646
If a patient is here depressed and at
the same time he has headaches,

9
00:01:54,417 --> 00:02:02,208
the right order will be depression to go
and the headaches will become worse.

10
00:02:02,292 --> 00:02:13,417
Perhaps with the same remedy, if it's not very deep, we'll continue and the headaches will also be better.

11
00:02:18,281 --> 00:02:37,333
What do we all want? You want to be a good Homeopath, that's one. Some of you have more ambitions, you want

12
00:02:37,417 --> 00:02:47,729
to be good homeopath who will teach, some of you want to be a good homeopath who teaches internationally.

13
00:02:47,813 --> 00:02:55,750
Some of you who have more ambitions,
you would like to be the Minister of Health
of your country and then

14
00:02:55,833 --> 00:03:02,083
impose Homeopathy and say,
'Eh now you had it'.

15
00:03:04,188 --> 00:03:28,250
And if you think in your mind, shall I be this? If I'll be this, shall I be really satisfied? And always there is something else that you want.

16
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:36,583
You'll find out that there is always something else, what is this something else ?

17
00:03:42,927 --> 00:04:00,042
We want a state in which we are in peace with ourselves. That state we call, it's a generic name, we call "happiness".

18
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:12,802
Unconditional happiness, we don't want a happiness which is dependant upon anything.

19
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:29,958
Whether I'm successful or not successful in my profession, whether she loves me or she does not love me.

20
00:04:31,635 --> 00:04:40,042
We don't want this dependence, we want unconditional happiness; this is what everybody actually wants.

21
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:52,458
If you search deep down in yourself you will find that this is really with what you will actually be satisfied.

22
00:04:53,583 --> 00:05:10,417
And that is why also, people who could stay isolated in the desert, a little place in the desert, you see an individual

23
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:16,125
who is very happy, very content with himself, he has nothing, not even water.

24
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:27,135
What is that makes him happy? He is in peace with himself. That means, being in peace with ourself, it's a huge

25
00:05:27,219 --> 00:05:45,750
objective that is very difficult for anyone to attain. We need to have an individual, a giant, a saint to attain that state.

26
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:54,594
So it is an objective. Since this is an objective for anyone to be satisfied, happy etc.

27
00:05:58,656 --> 00:06:10,333
the Medicine which helps an individual to go closer to that objective, is the correct Medicine.

28
00:06:13,323 --> 00:06:35,198
So if you are dissatisfied in your life...what is a problem with you? especially children do like this, you give a dose of

29
00:06:35,281 --> 00:06:47,792
Calcarea Phosphorica and the child next day is happy. You give a dose of Chamomilla and the child is quite happy,

30
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:59,750
 a dose of Cina, all these remedies with the very dissatisfied, inside them is like having worms.

31
00:07:02,615 --> 00:07:14,667
So therefore Homeopathy is a system of Medicine which can promote the evolution of the human being.

32
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:25,000
Because it takes away the pathology which is in the mental-emotional and leaves the individual

33
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:39,083
 to battle with what is natural tendencies
 for him to battle, to fight.

34
00:07:40,615 --> 00:07:50,135
All of us, as I said, we have negative points, weak points, we have to fight them ourselves, nobody can help.

35
00:07:50,219 --> 00:08:05,323
But these points which belong to our personality, under pathological conditions, they are exaggerated.

36
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:18,260
So a person who is very quick and perceptive by nature, by character, becomes very irritable if somebody

37
00:08:18,344 --> 00:08:23,500
 does not understand what he is saying.

38
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:44,500
This shows already a pathology starting and then he fights with his relatives, he fights with his wife, with his children and

39
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:51,792
he fights himself and after fighting, fighting he finds himself isolated.

40
00:08:51,875 --> 00:09:04,990
Once he finds himself isolated, the depression comes. Then from Nux-Vomica goes to Aurum states of depression etc.

41
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:18,885
So the pathology if it is left to work inside us, exaggerates more and more the negative qualities of our

42
00:09:18,969 --> 00:09:29,573
 personalities, it gives us the feeling that we are going away more and more from happiness.

43
00:09:30,365 --> 00:09:42,000
That's why, when we are healthy and we were children, we say I was so happy, I had a happy childhood

44
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:49,396
 and then problems came and then in order to fight the problems the pathology comes in

45
00:09:49,479 --> 00:10:00,344
and then you have a huge pathology later on which leads the patient to come to you to ask for help.

46
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:03,042
This is the whole picture.

47
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:18,625
We have another objective to establish an understanding of what is health.

48
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:29,042
And if we have accepted so far the idea
that an individual is functioning on 3 levels

49
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:36,542
actually we have to have a
definition that fits all the 3 levels.

50
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:56,417
What is the word that can characterize the definition on these 3 levels? The word is "Freedom" !

51
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:23,292
Health therefore, is freedom on the physical level, freedom from pain, discomfort. I'm not the slave of pain.

52
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:36,000
Did you ever have a toothache? Did you ever have a severe pain to see how much slave you are in that pain?

53
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:45,083
Can you think of anything else?
Forget it, you are a slave.

54
00:11:52,219 --> 00:12:01,125
Freedom from pain gives the definition of health in the physical.

55
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:16,083
But there are people who say I don't have pain but I have general malaise, a general feeling of tiredness in my body.

56
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:28,677
So therefore the freedom from pain has to be completed by a sense of well-being.

57
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:46,469
So the definition on the physical level has to be like this. Freedom from pain has having as a state a feeling of well being.

58
00:12:46,552 --> 00:12:55,573
I feel well. It's a long time since we felt like this.

59
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:10,292
When I was thinking about these issues and I was trying to get an answer, I have seen quite a lot of patients in the meantime.

60
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:23,333
I have seen healthy individuals. I remember a case of a villager who had come, not here, I was in Athens.

61
00:13:27,042 --> 00:13:44,625
He was relating to me a case where his neighbour came and put the boundaries of his land a little bit inside his.

62
00:13:46,708 --> 00:14:06,823
He says 'I took my gun, I went there and I shoot him'. And of course when he came to be treated he was after prison.

63
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:21,135
 Very strong, but was he healthy? I thought this man is not healthy in his emotional side.

64
00:14:23,552 --> 00:14:39,958
And then I treated a lot, here in Greece in these times 1960's still the Communists were people of great fanaticism and passion.

65
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:44,104
Down, the government and whatever !

66
00:14:46,656 --> 00:15:00,615
And I saw their psyche was always in a state of, you know if you mention the word "government"....

67
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:10,219
And I said, is this a healthy state?

68
00:15:11,292 --> 00:15:26,042
Then I saw other cases of people who were attached to another individual, usually a man to a woman.

69
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:38,167
 A man came and he was a slave to
 that passion for that particular woman.

70
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:50,417
His actions were irrational, totally
irrational, like the fanatics.

71
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:59,771
And you say, these are healthy people but in these levels something is wrong. What is wrong?

72
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:13,177
And then I saw spiritual people who were trying at least to attain it, they had a serenity and all that.

73
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:21,260
And how they faced all these
issues, with much more serenity.

74
00:16:22,635 --> 00:16:42,240
The definition of health was completed by the idea of freedom from passion on the emotional level.

75
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:55,771
If you are very passionate you are the slave of your passion, whatever it might be.

76
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:09,396
Then I saw individuals who had no passion at all.

77
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:34,656
They were people that had no passion
 for anything. No interested, nothing.

78
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:49,927
You lose your wife, it doesn't matter, you lose your home, it doesn't matter. He is a Mahatma, but he was not a Mahatma,

79
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:59,906
he was sick. He has apathy. That may give
 you the idea of freedom from passion

80
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:04,667
 but on the other hand you are apathetic.

81
00:18:08,323 --> 00:18:23,167
So the definition on this level should be that the person has to be free from passion but he has to have inside him

82
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:40,802
a dynamic serenity, dynamic calmness. The calmness which is alive, not a dead calmness, not I'm indifferent.

83
00:18:40,885 --> 00:18:53,906
I'm calm but I'm alive, perceptive. I think about everything, I perceive, I respond.

84
00:18:54,927 --> 00:19:02,531
Somebody is suffering I respond, somebody wants my help, I respond, somebody wants to talk, yes.

85
00:19:02,615 --> 00:19:09,344
I am alive but not passionate !

86
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:17,677
Either you have Homeopathy,
everyone has Homeopathy or die!

87
00:19:21,677 --> 00:19:34,104
I take a bomb and I throw a bomb in the world because the world does not accept Homeopathy. I could be like this, why not.

88
00:19:34,188 --> 00:19:38,958
Many of you think I am like this, it doesn't matter.

89
00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:48,625
I am much more tolerant unfortunately.

90
00:19:55,792 --> 00:20:05,708
So, I felt that the people who are really more in peace with themselves, they were more perceptive,

91
00:20:05,792 --> 00:20:26,021
 more ready to come to the rescue, that means you have more love. Love flows naturally, you don't say to yourself

92
00:20:26,104 --> 00:20:34,156
'oh, I have to help'. If you say this, forget
it, the emotions are gone.

93
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:53,177
You make a program, today I'll help this, this and then you try to accomplish these things, forget it, this is not healthy.

94
00:20:54,812 --> 00:21:12,167
But if you attain that state where there is no irritability, no passionate attachement to anything idea or whatever

95
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:23,667
then you may have a dynamic serenity inside
you and face calmly the situations.

96
00:21:24,458 --> 00:21:35,375
Who can do it? Nobody, but I say this is the target of a healthy state. It is where we should be looking at

97
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:48,177
 not that anybody is like that. Perhaps
some of you have some grandfather

98
00:21:48,260 --> 00:22:05,010
 whom you remember in the end years being like this but it's not an easy state to attain. So we are looking towards that.

99
00:22:05,344 --> 00:22:14,552
And then we come to the mental state. The health of the mental state that is even more difficult to attain.

100
00:22:14,635 --> 00:22:32,542
Because there we have to have freedom from - nobody has that - a healhty mental state

101
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:50,292
is a state where you are free from selfishness. You are not selfish anymore.

102
00:22:51,708 --> 00:23:08,375
This is something for sure impossible for anyone to attain. All, we are selfish, I want this, I want that.

103
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:20,823
It is not possible to eliminate selfishness.
Because if you eliminate selfishness

104
00:23:20,906 --> 00:23:32,323
 that means the sense that I'm separate, I am a separate human being - this is selfishness;

105
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:46,802
 I am and I want this, that and the other is 3-5 meters away, and the world is all around me.

106
00:23:48,417 --> 00:24:00,354
If we can eliminate that then the state in which we enter is a different state. We can make a jump in the consciousness

107
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:19,104
and then we are actually connected with the cosmic consciousness, with God. Who can do that?

108
00:24:23,792 --> 00:24:37,417
You see it is pure mechanics. The moment I'm here and I'm separate, I cannot be flowing into the consciousness.

109
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:51,042
 I have the sense that I am here so everything will be limited, everything will be measured

110
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:59,208
 from me to that distance, to the other person, to the other things.

111
00:24:59,292 --> 00:25:11,708
If I can eliminate this idea, I'm nothing,
 then I'm one with the consciousness.

112
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:22,958
 It is a very high spiritual state towards which we may be going, freedom from selfishness.

113
00:25:23,042 --> 00:25:48,375
It's the effort that everyone of us is doing every day to be able to be less selfish to be more in connection with that which we call God.

114
00:25:49,125 --> 00:26:05,583
 We cannot eliminate that. I feel that nobody can really eliminate his selfishness, this egoistic element which is with us.

115
00:26:05,667 --> 00:26:18,552
It's not possible but we all try towards that goal. And I'll tell you something, the new generation

116
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:41,333
 is thinking a lot on these lines. That is why by taking the wrong path they went into drugs, they wanted to

117
00:26:41,417 --> 00:26:54,750
experience the sense of not being, so they took the drug and some of them they experience something so nice.

118
00:26:54,833 --> 00:27:06,438
And then they became slaves of that passion which is called spiritual passion or whatever.

119
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:29,750
Because we can be slaves of our desire to become this, to become saints, one with the cosmic consciousness.

120
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:45,531
So therefore a person comes to you and you talk with them and you understand more or less where they stand,

121
00:27:45,615 --> 00:27:55,208
what they want, where are their shorcomings because we all have shortcomings, we all have weak points.

122
00:27:55,292 --> 00:28:13,104
And what you do as a healer you try to ease out these points. It's like somebody who is suffering, because

123
00:28:13,188 --> 00:28:29,667
people who come to us, suffer for years. Can you imagine somebody who needs a bit of attention, he never had

124
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:44,000
any attention and you just give a bit of attention and some care and he feels so good. You don't do that because

125
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:54,208
 this is very little, temporary. Psychotherapists, psychologists they are doing quite a lot of that.

126
00:28:54,292 --> 00:29:11,333
But we have a possibility to give relief on a deeper level and that is why we have to stay objective observers,

127
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:18,219
not to get involved. Oh I love you, you are so nice !

128
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:32,313
If you do this in a Homeopathic consultation you lose the truth of the other person, you don't understand what is happening.

129
00:29:32,458 --> 00:29:44,354
You cannot see the picture, if you are involved. A person comes who likes you and you like her

130
00:29:48,792 --> 00:29:56,000
you feel both very well doing the interview, she gives you some compliments, you give her some compliments.

131
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:07,333
She goes away today, tomorrow and then again in depression. Because you did not realize that this is a case of Aurum

132
00:30:07,417 --> 00:30:25,667
 or Natrum muriaticum, you did not realize because you got involved. So we don't do this temporary relief

133
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:40,958
where you give some sympathy. We are acused for giving attention and they say if you give so much attention

134
00:30:41,042 --> 00:30:48,490
to an individual it's natural he will feel better and that's why you have some results with Homeopathy.

135
00:30:49,885 --> 00:31:09,438
That for me is pure noncense. Because I have seen cases where I paid very little attention and I had the most fantastic cure.

136
00:31:09,521 --> 00:31:17,771
I saw a sign, I saw a little thing, I asked one or two questions, take this and go. How is that?

137
00:31:26,438 --> 00:31:40,375
I remember a case from Germany, he had come with his child, he brought his child in 1969. His child was suffering

138
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:52,688
with asthma, he was a greek architect living in Germany.

139
00:31:52,771 --> 00:32:00,917
By that time we did not have pharmacy, we just dispensed the remedy. So I said to the child 'open your mouth'

140
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:15,042
and I put this and I said 'ok go'. They went. The child was cured. 10-15 years later I hear that this man

141
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:29,042
 is back to Greece and he's talking and he says 'George he doesn't have to give you a remedy, he just does this'.

142
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:41,625
He had forgotten that I told the child open your mouth and I put it. All this has gone out and the only thing he remembered

143
00:32:41,708 --> 00:32:59,438
was that I said ok, be well. He was an architect, he was an educated man. Later I met him and said, are you serious?

144
00:32:59,521 --> 00:33:03,792
He said 'yes this is what I thought'.

145
00:33:06,125 --> 00:33:16,042
That means autosuggestion or whatever you call it. This is pure nonsense, absolutely.

146
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:23,667
You have to be objective, to know what you're doing, you give it and then forget about it.

147
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:29,927
You don't have to give attention,
how nice you are etc.

148
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:40,708
Sometimes of course if the person is totally distressed and you feel that the next day is going to jump from the window

149
00:33:40,792 --> 00:33:44,865
 then you may say a few good words, pay more attention.

150
00:33:56,677 --> 00:34:12,875
But we have the possibility to relieve this pain in a very deep level and give the possibility to the individual

151
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:22,531
 to continue with his life and do whatever he likes with. it.

152
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:40,396
The problem is that they come to you so distressed and say 'I will change my life if I find my health back'.

153
00:34:40,677 --> 00:34:50,000
You say but you have being doing all these things which are not correct, smoking, drinking a lot forget it, don't do it.

154
00:34:51,625 --> 00:34:55,750
They say absolutely I'm not going to touch anything. You say 'ok take it'.

155
00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:01,510
After a few years they have again the same thing.

156
00:35:01,594 --> 00:35:12,417
The same thing and of course is a relapse because the way of your life brings about a relapse.

157
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:24,510
Then they come back to you and again they promise, no I'm not going to do it. They continue doing it. Third relapse.

158
00:35:27,594 --> 00:35:34,792
So the definition for health is freedom, freedom, freedom.

159
00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:42,677
Not anarchism.

160
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:55,865
This has nothing to do with governments, I'm not an anarchist.

161
00:35:55,948 --> 00:36:00,292
It has to do with inner states.

162
00:36:02,458 --> 00:36:14,063
How can we know how far we can take that individual to health?

163
00:36:17,969 --> 00:36:27,042
You see an individual and you have more or less the idea how far you can take him to health through Homeopathy.
