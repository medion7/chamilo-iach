1
00:00:20,542 --> 00:00:32,458
So for those who do not know the kind of Homeopathy which is practiced here, I have to say a few things.

2
00:00:33,531 --> 00:00:47,958
That you will see me taking a case and you will not be able, sometimes, to understand the questions, why?

3
00:00:48,354 --> 00:01:01,208
Because you have not been educated. You have not taken the whole course to know all the remedies, all the questions etc.

4
00:01:01,271 --> 00:01:10,010
So, be patient those who do not understand.
I have to explain to you the strategy

5
00:01:10,115 --> 00:01:16,115
 I'm following in order to understand
more or less what's going on.

6
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:28,292
As I am a person who knows Homeopathy
and I have some experience,

7
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:40,333
when I hear a few symptoms, immediately
I'm thinking of some remedies.

8
00:01:41,563 --> 00:01:49,698
The usual thing that you are learning in certain schools that you have been before, according

9
00:01:49,802 --> 00:02:05,073
to this, they say first let the patient tell you the whole story and then put some questions and then you decide.

10
00:02:06,135 --> 00:02:09,917
Here, it's not so.

11
00:02:10,021 --> 00:02:16,938
Unfortunately we do not have
 the time and the luxury to do this.

12
00:02:17,042 --> 00:02:24,135
Because if I do this for the whole
week we will see one case.

13
00:02:25,177 --> 00:02:37,146
You don't want that. You want to see how Homeopathy is practiced in a practical manner,
 in real situation

14
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:49,698
where you have a practice and people are coming to be treated. You have scheduled
5-10 people in a day.

15
00:02:49,802 --> 00:03:06,740
You're not going to hear stories and stories. You want to find the remedy and this is the most important thing.

16
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:17,208
Because it doesn't matter how much
 the person will say about himself.

17
00:03:17,313 --> 00:03:30,052
Still he will not be healed. It may be good
 for the person to talk about himself.

18
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:41,938
So in this way, we may have what we call a placebo effect. Somebody comes and sees that we are very sympathetic,

19
00:03:42,042 --> 00:03:50,229
we are listening to him, we are very perceptive of his problem.

20
00:03:50,333 --> 00:04:04,323
 He feels at ease to talk and that is
a kind of psychotherapy, some kind.

21
00:04:05,417 --> 00:04:14,542
And that is why, as Homeopaths,
we have a lot of cases of placebo effect.

22
00:04:14,781 --> 00:04:23,875
It's not the remedy, it is because you
listen to the person very carefully.

23
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:26,813
So we come back to the strategy we follow. When a person gives me a few symptoms

24
00:05:26,917 --> 00:05:40,625
I know more or less what might be his remedy.
I ask certain questions concerning this remedy,
 I try to confirm.

25
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:59,354
 In this way he adds one more information which is negating what I thought, ok, I go to another idea.

26
00:05:59,896 --> 00:06:14,781
I ask questions concerning a new idea.
This is the kind of taking of the case that you
 will follow.

27
00:06:17,073 --> 00:06:33,760
But I have to tell you a few things which are
 very important. For instance, as you know,

28
00:06:33,865 --> 00:06:49,646
a person is bothered by heat and when he comes to the fresh air, he says, he feels better.

29
00:06:50,760 --> 00:07:01,563
This is a subtle point which
is so important for Homeopathy;

30
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:09,229
you cannot imagine the
importance of such a symptom.

31
00:07:10,448 --> 00:07:26,052
Why, what happens to the organism who is coming out to the air and the whole organism is rejuvenated?

32
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:40,719
 How comes? In the fresh air the energy
 is coming up, better feelings.

33
00:07:41,604 --> 00:07:54,646
Then you get another one, he sits there
and feels, oh my god there is a draft
 somewhere I feel it.

34
00:07:55,958 --> 00:08:08,073
And more and more is constricted; his cervical region becomes more and more constricted.

35
00:08:08,177 --> 00:08:15,031
His back, oh my god where is
coming this bloody draft?

36
00:08:15,135 --> 00:08:25,625
Nobody realizes actually where this draft
 comes that the organism perceives.

37
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:46,854
This little bit of draft contracts the muscles and creates in the whole organism such a difference

38
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:58,229
 between a normality and total discomfort.

39
00:09:03,354 --> 00:09:16,406
These things are so important with Homeopathy which you cannot dispense with.

40
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:25,417
For instance if I ask you, which is the
remedy which is better in open air?

41
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:32,333
-Who says Pulsatilla?

42
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:48,385
Who doesn't say Pulsatilla? You know what
 that means? That those who put their hands
 up know Puls for sure.

43
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:53,875
Pulsatilla is better in open air.
The others, they are not sure.

44
00:09:53,958 --> 00:10:05,156
This lacking of knowledge is very important because you may not be able to recognize
 a Puls case.

45
00:10:11,646 --> 00:10:34,719
When you examine a person and you find this
 is a Puls case and the person has come with hay fever etc.

46
00:10:36,667 --> 00:10:46,313
If you ask him when you are in the open air,
you feel better? What is the answer?

47
00:10:46,427 --> 00:10:50,167
-Who says yes?

48
00:10:51,313 --> 00:11:07,125
No, Pulsatilla in this local symptom
 is worse in the open air.

49
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:17,760
You see already you got two
 little things for a hay fever.

50
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:42,333
Puls eats the fat?
Meat with a piece of fat very good for Puls.

51
00:11:46,000 --> 00:12:03,177
This Puls hates. It will take out all the
 pieces of fat but you say, what about butter?

52
00:12:05,135 --> 00:12:23,688
You will hear, I relish butter. I put a lot
of butter. Little things like that.

53
00:12:26,073 --> 00:12:47,563
If you have a case in which the main symptom
is depression and the desire to die really.
 I'm not interested.

54
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:59,406
And the person says, you ask the person, 'is any condition which makes you feel better?'

55
00:13:00,417 --> 00:13:18,625
And she says, usually a woman, 'when I am outside and the wind is blowing my depression
 is lifted'.

56
00:13:20,469 --> 00:13:34,917
If that is what the person has told you, then the remedy is not Pulsatilla. It's Aurum muriaticum.

57
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:52,354
How comes that the headache is better in the open air? We don't know the chemistry.

58
00:13:52,458 --> 00:14:00,917
We don't know really what happens but it is a fact that when the headache is better, is Pulsatilla.

59
00:14:01,427 --> 00:14:05,406
 When the depression is better
 is Aurum muriaticum.

60
00:14:10,979 --> 00:14:18,250
How can you define this through
 physiology and anatomy?

61
00:14:18,354 --> 00:14:24,365
 It's not possible to know the chemistry
what takes place within the organism.

62
00:14:24,469 --> 00:14:31,813
Because the organism is so complex,
you cannot imagine the complexity.

63
00:14:31,917 --> 00:14:42,052
I mean nobody could ever imagine the complexity of the human brain. And I don't believe

64
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:51,177
that anybody ever will find out what's
going on with the human brain.

65
00:14:51,948 --> 00:15:05,354
They try to locate where is, in the brain,
where is located conscience.

66
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:13,844
Not consciousness. It's different.

67
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:28,781
 I have a bad conscience. I have a clean conscience, it's different than I'm conscious of, I'm aware of.

68
00:15:29,292 --> 00:15:44,646
Where is located? They are trying to locate it,
 the neurophysiologists, different experiments.

69
00:15:49,094 --> 00:16:03,792
According to me, they will never find.
Because that quality of the human being
 belongs to

70
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:12,823
the whole human being, not to
a particular place within the brain.

71
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:24,698
Never mind how long they may be trying.
So, we Homeopaths, are hundreds of years ahead

72
00:16:24,802 --> 00:16:39,781
 in understanding health and disease than what materialistic Medicine is knowing so far.

73
00:16:40,563 --> 00:16:52,021
That is why if you are a good homeopath you
 can do a better and more quick diagnosis of a case

74
00:16:52,740 --> 00:17:08,625
than all the laboratory tests they can bring you.
I will show you a case. I had seen in Berlin.

75
00:17:09,115 --> 00:17:21,823
I was there, giving a seminar and a case was presented to me, a little girl. Her mother is a medical doctor.

76
00:17:23,615 --> 00:17:42,792
She said to me, my girl has been diagnosed as Still's disease, it's juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.

77
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:54,667
It makes the joints swell and distorted.

78
00:17:56,229 --> 00:18:04,448
I took the case and I said, who said this diagnosis? She said, 3 hospitals in Germany.

79
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:12,677
I go inside the class to analyze
 the case, the mother was sitting there.

80
00:18:12,781 --> 00:18:22,583
I said, I'm sorry but this case is not Still's disease. She said, what it is?

81
00:18:22,688 --> 00:18:37,073
 I said, I don't know the syndrome but this is a hereditary syndrome which is very severe

82
00:18:37,177 --> 00:18:48,000
and according to my understanding the child will not go over 7 years. The child was 1,5.

83
00:18:51,135 --> 00:19:00,479
The mother comes afterwards and says, what are you talking? I said, I don't know what is the syndrome

84
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:11,708
but definitely this is not a rheumatoid arthritis, it is something much more severe and it is hereditary.

85
00:19:13,292 --> 00:19:41,292
She takes the child and goes back to 3 different hospitals. One of the hospitals they made the correct diagnosis.

86
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:54,073
Morbus Farber's disease for those
who know some good medicine.

87
00:19:57,719 --> 00:20:09,958
It is a deficiency in a particular enzyme,
 it's called ceramidase.

88
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:20,458
In the books, it was written when I went
back I read, children live up to 7 years old.

89
00:20:20,563 --> 00:20:28,854
It was unbelievable what I was saying.
 Because I didn't know the syndrome and

90
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:40,156
yet I was able to understand that a person with this problem is not going to go over 7 years.

91
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:55,292
With Homeopathy all these years, about 12
 years of Homeopathy, the child is now 13.

92
00:20:57,667 --> 00:21:11,104
I don't know how long it's going to live and she
 is on a wheel chair. Still the deformities are apparent

93
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:19,000
but not to the extend she was,
she was not able to talk.

94
00:21:26,917 --> 00:21:34,844
But I will show you some pictures of the child to understand. Why a homeopath can make

95
00:21:34,917 --> 00:21:42,042
 a diagnosis and all the laboratories
and all the knowledge of

96
00:21:43,000 --> 00:22:00,719
speciality of the people could not understand
the difference between Still's disease and something else.

97
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:13,615
This is not Still's disease. You see the nose was deformed because this disease affects the cartilages

98
00:22:13,719 --> 00:22:23,677
which are expanding and the cartilages expanding make fantastic deformities.

99
00:22:23,781 --> 00:22:31,781
The person cannot really
use the hands or the voice.

100
00:22:42,042 --> 00:22:48,052
So I come back to the idea of
what you are going to watch.

101
00:22:52,469 --> 00:23:09,271
When you are learning in the school how to take a case, actually you are not learning anything.

102
00:23:10,719 --> 00:23:18,729
One time I had a class like that; I said to them, you don't know anything about Homeopathy.

103
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:30,542
They were medical doctors. Ok, take the case of one another and show me what information you had.

104
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:37,250
 Two lines, each.
 He had headaches and he had this.

105
00:23:38,094 --> 00:23:44,844
He had vomiting at the age of 10
and then tonsillitis.

106
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:59,917
You see what you have done, you went back to your memory to what you know about medicine

107
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:07,406
and you applied this knowledge
 to the taking of the case.

108
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:30,271
Is anybody eggastrimithos? (ventriloquist).
You know people who talk with their abdomen,

109
00:24:32,563 --> 00:24:46,135
it seems to me there is somebody here
who is doing this. No.

110
00:24:51,677 --> 00:25:06,750
So I told them, ok now I'm going to teach you in this course something else. What is this something else?

111
00:25:07,313 --> 00:25:12,583
It is what we call the Materia Medica.

112
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:28,813
But the question is: is it possible that any
 human brain can hold all the information

113
00:25:28,917 --> 00:25:35,979
 of 12 volumes of Materia Medica?
Is it possible?

114
00:25:36,146 --> 00:25:45,844
By the way, my 12th volume of
Materia Medica Viva is coming out soon.

115
00:25:48,958 --> 00:26:01,583
So if you are interested maybe put some orders because in about 20 days, it will be out.

116
00:26:02,604 --> 00:26:26,875
 I will tell you which remedies are there. Iris, Hepar, Hyoscyamus, Ignatia, Iodum, Hypericum.

117
00:26:27,646 --> 00:26:38,958
These are the remedies which are contained in this Materia Medica in a very expanded form

118
00:26:39,052 --> 00:26:49,667
with the original, essential features
which is about 2 pages each.

119
00:26:52,292 --> 00:27:10,292
So the information that you must have in your mind is tremendous. How can you hold it?
 It's not possible.

120
00:27:12,385 --> 00:27:28,000
What you need is to hold in your brain
a few main points, we call them keynotes
of the remedies.

121
00:27:28,167 --> 00:27:40,958
If you manage to hold the keynotes in your
 brain, then you have a fantastic information.

122
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:54,490
Now the problem is who is the one who will
tell you which are the important points in
each remedy?

123
00:27:55,052 --> 00:27:59,958
-You.

124
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:17,677
-You see, the person who has a lot of experience can really transfer to you the information who says,

125
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:29,208
 in many cases of Iodium I have seen
 this, this and that keynotes.

126
00:28:29,313 --> 00:28:39,385
 Therefore you have to get the correct information about the remedy. From whom?

127
00:28:41,177 --> 00:29:00,000
The problem is that today we don't have legalized schools. Anybody can open a school, no problem.

128
00:29:00,802 --> 00:29:15,208
What is teaching, I don't know. But there are
 no standard things which are taught in these,
 so called, homeopathic schools.

129
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:33,563
Unless in a school you learn the correct Materia Medica, you are gathering in your brain information

130
00:29:33,667 --> 00:29:42,542
which is rubbish and you need to get it out in order to put the correct information, later on.

131
00:29:43,844 --> 00:29:55,823
 You see this is a big problem which happens
 in our science. I tell you some facts.

132
00:29:58,698 --> 00:30:11,438
When I was practicing in Athens, and I had
a lot of medical doctors practising with me.
 What we were using?

133
00:30:11,719 --> 00:30:22,802
Kent's Repertory and Materia Medica and Materia Medica Boericke, basically.

134
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:37,542
You won't believe the success
rate we had with this information.

135
00:30:37,646 --> 00:30:49,500
Why? Because I have given to my students the information which I have gathered 15 years back.

136
00:30:49,604 --> 00:30:54,990
I have given them the main points
so they would be able to recognize

137
00:30:55,094 --> 00:31:05,292
whether a case is a Mercury or it is a
Calcarea carbonica or a Pulsatilla.

138
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:14,563
Which are the differential points to understand the difference between the one and the other?

139
00:31:20,021 --> 00:31:30,583
So, when Bill Gray, who knows Bill Gray?
Who knows Roger Morisson?

140
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:39,521
Both of these American doctors came to study with me in Athens. Bill Gray came in 1976,

141
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:56,458
he sat next to me like some other doctors were sitting and I have asked Bill, when a person was coming in as a follow up,

142
00:31:56,563 --> 00:32:11,740
 I said to Bill, ask him in English: 'how are you?'.
 And the 99% of the answers was 'much better'.

143
00:32:18,958 --> 00:32:31,292
After a few months he told me, 'I will not sit next to you because it is routine. I know if he comes he will say, much better'. Why?

144
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:42,250
Because the information on the Materia Medica that we had, it was the correct kind of information.

145
00:32:43,208 --> 00:32:47,354
That is why you will have these results.

146
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:57,250
I come back now to the idea of the
 specialist who has some knowledge.

147
00:32:57,271 --> 00:33:06,104
 If you are a medical doctor you
 have the knowledge of medicine.

148
00:33:06,208 --> 00:33:12,208
You have added now the knowledge
 of Materia Medica.

149
00:33:12,313 --> 00:33:19,333
So you are able now to see a case with
 a different perspective all together.

150
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:32,604
You are asking a question, 'how are you affected by drafts?'. 'No problem'. Finish the question.

151
00:33:33,938 --> 00:33:49,438
The other one says: 'drafts oh my god I can't stand them'. Another one: 'I don't like them'.

152
00:33:49,542 --> 00:34:02,583
So in experience what you will find out is that each symptom has a degree of intensity.

153
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:13,562
It is this degree of intensity which becomes important eventually because if the person

154
00:34:13,667 --> 00:34:29,177
will tell you: 'I can't stand drafts at all',
your mind goes to which remedies?

155
00:34:30,844 --> 00:34:42,292
-Kali-carbonicum, Lobelia, Hepar, Silica.

156
00:34:51,083 --> 00:35:05,750
There are 3 remedies which are quite strong, Rhus-t., Calc-p. and Cimic. for what?

157
00:35:06,448 --> 00:35:12,719
If there is a draft affects their cervical region.

158
00:35:32,938 --> 00:35:47,802
You see you have to be very careful because here you are going to do the most detailed examination, right?

159
00:35:50,156 --> 00:36:12,563
The one who is affected by draft mostly in
the lumbar region, is not so much Cimic.
It is Kali-c, is Calc.

160
00:36:16,646 --> 00:36:29,958
The Calc-p., is affected very much
 in which kind of weather?

161
00:36:31,115 --> 00:36:44,135
Just after the snow, this weather which
 is wet and cold. It's killing for Calc-p.

162
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:56,917
 There are a lot of remedies which are affected by wet and cold. One main remedy is ...?

163
00:36:58,208 --> 00:37:08,542
-Dulcamara! Correct. But Dulc., how
mostly will be affected?

164
00:37:16,094 --> 00:37:17,187
-From warm to cold?

165
00:37:17,292 --> 00:37:22,073
-No, where in the body?

166
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:29,875
-Knee joints.

167
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:44,760
-In the joints, yes. The pains in the joints
will increase. What else?

168
00:37:49,052 --> 00:38:06,094
You will see that also he can affect the
colon the guts and you may have diarrheas.

169
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:15,562
So exposing especially the feet in cold and
wet and getting diarrheas, the remedy

170
00:38:16,625 --> 00:38:23,781
 is not anymore Rhus-t
and it's not Calc, it's not Kali-c.

171
00:38:32,708 --> 00:38:49,917
But if the person says, worse from drafts, very much worse but I'm better from wet weather?

172
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:17,760
-Hep. and Kali-c and Nux-v, except Caust.

173
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:43,292
Causticum is better in wet weather. He feels more energy and that his  pains in the joints
 are better.

174
00:39:55,688 --> 00:40:09,479
How is it possible, if you have a case in front
 of you and you give one hour for the case to investigate that case.

175
00:40:11,094 --> 00:40:20,292
How is it possible to speed up the time,
to arrive to the correct remedy?

176
00:40:23,427 --> 00:40:26,271
You need some technique.

177
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:39,177
You need first of all to know the keynotes of
the Materia Medica, the first you have to know.

178
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:46,708
That's why I said, did you go through  the complete course? Because there I gave all
the keynotes.

179
00:40:46,958 --> 00:40:55,771
It's not possible to give all the keynotes in
a seminar like that because it's not the first
year studies.

180
00:40:55,875 --> 00:40:58,302
It is a post-graduated study.

181
00:40:58,406 --> 00:41:06,354
Some of you were waiting to hear this
new case that we are going to hear

182
00:41:06,458 --> 00:41:11,156
and to see whether you can spot the remedy.

183
00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:20,656
And sometimes the remedy is so difficult
to spot that even the whole class,

184
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:28,792
maybe there is not one person in the
class who can see the remedy, why?

185
00:41:30,115 --> 00:41:37,156
Because there are some degrees of
 knowledge of the Materia Medica,

186
00:41:38,177 --> 00:41:45,229
either we want it or not this is a fact.

187
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:10,250
The Indian books they smell. If you
smell an Indian book there is a smell.

188
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:21,135
If you enter India there is a particular smell all over. And if you don't like that smell, don't go.

189
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:35,052
I had a colleague, a gynecologist, he is a Professor now. He says, I went once and we landed in Bombay

190
00:42:35,156 --> 00:42:49,448
 in the airport and he said, 'I got out for a while,
I got in again and I don't want to fly over India because it smells so much'.

191
00:42:52,229 --> 00:43:03,688
Yet when I was in India I was so happy, I never was so happy in my life. Indian people are real people.
