1
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:26,167
You have to study, there is no way that
 you can learn without studying.

2
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:36,510
We tell whatever we tell here but you have
 to be grounded in Homeopathy.

3
00:00:36,615 --> 00:00:42,312
Homeopathy has to become a
kind of second nature.

4
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:51,979
Everything concerning health is evaluated according to that knowledge

5
00:00:52,083 --> 00:01:01,875
which will be inside you. You have a
knowledge and then evaluate every time.

6
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:09,865
You cannot imagine the difference.
You'll see in your practice, the difference.

7
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:34,750
We'll talk a bit more lightly now.
This was a little bit heavy.

8
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:51,219
You know this graph from my book,
a human being functions in 3 levels

9
00:01:51,323 --> 00:01:58,313
mental, emotional, physical.

10
00:01:58,417 --> 00:02:12,313
These function as one, I'm G.V.
you are N.K. etc. as one individual,

11
00:02:12,417 --> 00:02:23,396
 through something which
connects the 3 levels.

12
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:32,646
That which connects these 3 levels
and makes them happen,

13
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:41,688
whatever I think, I have a fear,
I get scared, ex. there is an earthquake

14
00:02:45,677 --> 00:03:00,615
- don't worry if it comes. It may come, the building is built in such a way that it will not fall.

15
00:03:05,813 --> 00:03:11,354
So, if the fear comes, the fear is
 a thought, I'm going to die,

16
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:16,042
immediately you see the perspiration
 and the palpitation.

17
00:03:16,146 --> 00:03:23,417
That which connects the mental,
the emotional and the physical is

18
00:03:23,521 --> 00:03:31,438
what we call the bioenergy, the energy,
 the vital force as Hahnemann called it.

19
00:03:31,542 --> 00:03:45,042
It's the energy which connects the
 3 functioning as one. This is something

20
00:03:45,146 --> 00:03:56,573
extremely important and also important
is the fact that these 3 levels in us

21
00:03:56,677 --> 00:04:08,792
 are in hierarchical order, more important,
 less important, less important etc.

22
00:04:09,771 --> 00:04:23,448
Highest importance in us has the mental
 level which you see it is included inside,

23
00:04:23,552 --> 00:04:35,156
it is the most protected. We don't go crazy.
 You see it took hundreds and hundreds

24
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:50,542
of years to make through wrong treatment
 the population of western people, crazy.

25
00:04:51,833 --> 00:05:02,115
We are, most of us, affected in mental
and emotional level. We have fears,

26
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:11,229
we have anxieties, we have all kinds of
psychological problems, perversions etc.

27
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:18,229
 We have affected our mental
and emotional state quite a lot.

28
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:27,938
It took hundreds of years for this to
happen in such huge numbers

29
00:05:28,042 --> 00:05:38,729
as we are today. The psychotropic
drugs which are sold by the companies

30
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:43,833
 today are the highest from
other drugs. What happens?

31
00:05:44,323 --> 00:05:50,938
The psychological disturbance on the
planet which we call western

32
00:05:51,042 --> 00:05:56,240
civilized countries, the most
disturbance has gone to the mental

33
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:09,448
and emotional levels, where countries like
Africa, Asia and undeveloped countries of S.A.

34
00:06:09,552 --> 00:06:16,417
do not have mental disorders
 to that extent at all.

35
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:25,604
So you will see the connection
between what we did to ourselves,

36
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:39,688
what civilized medicine did to
 our generation. Treating the wrong way

37
00:06:39,792 --> 00:06:51,781
 all along and pushing diseases more and
 more to mental and emotional level.

38
00:06:51,885 --> 00:06:59,198
You see, from the outside diseases went deeper and deeper to mental and emotional states.

39
00:06:59,302 --> 00:07:11,448
This is our understanding today. So next question is to find in which paragraphs

40
00:07:11,552 --> 00:07:17,552
Hahnemann mentions
the mental and emotional levels.

41
00:07:19,854 --> 00:07:30,177
Now the different kinds of medicine that
 we have applied ourselves, there were

42
00:07:30,281 --> 00:07:41,833
different kinds of therapeutic measurements
that we applied all through the generations.

43
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:52,958
On mental level, there are treatments which
 are directed towards mental level.

44
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:58,677
Which are these treatments
 that we have today?

45
00:08:02,323 --> 00:08:22,750
By affecting the mental level, they try to cure a patient. They do psycho-analysis, of course.

46
00:08:23,552 --> 00:08:32,531
Almost everybody has gone to psycho-
analysis today. We have been through

47
00:08:32,635 --> 00:08:42,115
psychoanalysis, that was the big
discovery on the 20th century.

48
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:53,646
 Before the 20th century, no psychoanalysis.
At the end of the 20th century,

49
00:08:53,750 --> 00:09:07,604
 suddenly there was a need for psychoanalysis, and psychotherapists and psychologists

50
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:18,083
expanded to cover the demand. What
that means? Most of the population,

51
00:09:18,188 --> 00:09:25,813
especially the American population, the Americans found out how good is to have

52
00:09:25,917 --> 00:09:37,417
a psychoanalyst and what he does addresses you on the mental level and tells you,

53
00:09:37,521 --> 00:09:45,063
don't worry there is a reason for your
anxiety, there is a reason for your fears.

54
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:49,156
Try to find the reason and then
redirect your mind instead of thinking

55
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:59,552
of the anxiety, to think why do I have
the anxiety and dig inside you

56
00:09:59,656 --> 00:10:07,885
and you'll find out that your mother was
not proper mother, she had a boyfriend

57
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:13,292
you did not like him, he did not like you,
and then you reconnect with your father,

58
00:10:13,396 --> 00:10:21,490
 your father was this and that and you
search etc. and the anxiety is reduced.

59
00:10:21,594 --> 00:10:29,531
Because the mind has been redirected
into something else but the main thing

60
00:10:29,635 --> 00:10:37,469
for me is why such a need for
psychoanalysts in the West?

61
00:10:37,573 --> 00:10:52,063
Do you have psychoanalysis in the Zulu tribe? Do you have psychoanalysts in India?

62
00:10:52,167 --> 00:11:02,188
Thailand? China? Brazil?

63
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:12,854
Why? Because people there, are still
suffering mostly on physical level.

64
00:11:14,438 --> 00:11:22,198
Why have we come about to this deep
 level, ourselves? Do you know why?

65
00:11:22,302 --> 00:11:29,354
Because of some measures that were
applied to us in a very general way.

66
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:39,219
What were such measures?
Except of antibiotics.

67
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:53,750
Vaccination was applied to all western population, thinking that we are

68
00:11:53,854 --> 00:12:07,021
more smart than nature. And if we
analyze what vaccination is doing,

69
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:19,542
 we'll see that it forces the organism
 to produce antibodies.

70
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:28,490
At what cost is the big question mark.
Are you forcing so deep an organism

71
00:12:28,594 --> 00:12:36,656
to do something without
punishment? Is it possible?

72
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:45,750
You change the structure of an organism
 to behave in a different way.

73
00:12:45,854 --> 00:12:52,510
Ah, wait a moment you are going to pay
 for that. And what is the payment?

74
00:12:52,615 --> 00:13:00,510
The payment is the increase in
neuro-muscular diseases,

75
00:13:00,615 --> 00:13:13,417
multiple sclerosis, all kinds of myasthenia,
ALS, all these severe

76
00:13:13,521 --> 00:13:19,156
neuro-muscular disorders,
which have exploded today.

77
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:27,844
So the nervous system, we see it primarily affected by these interferences and going

78
00:13:27,948 --> 00:13:31,750
deeper into the nervous - from the
peripheral nervous system,

79
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:36,979
into the central nervous system - where
we have the change in the mentality

80
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:44,510
and the manifestations of fears,
phobias and all kind of

81
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:49,771
psychological disorders and diseases.

82
00:13:52,927 --> 00:14:02,458
That is why the application of
psychotherapy on the mental level.

83
00:14:04,042 --> 00:14:12,146
But you will see the difference between Homeopathy and these treatments.

84
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:24,146
The treatment is directed on one
part of the body, mental level.

85
00:14:25,396 --> 00:14:34,604
And there is another level on which
some therapists are directed

86
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,781
and this is the emotional level.

87
00:14:37,885 --> 00:14:45,708
Can you tell me any therapy directed
on the emotional level?

88
00:14:51,885 --> 00:15:02,448
You need a positive shock on the
emotional level to bring about a cure

89
00:15:02,552 --> 00:15:08,010
and sometimes it happens.

90
00:15:10,573 --> 00:15:23,563
Musical therapy, yes. This is a therapy
 but to cure really a chronic disease,

91
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:35,281
 music is very, very, mild shock.
You need a big shock.

92
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:48,729
I will tell you. You have a person who
is living in a state of indifference.

93
00:15:50,281 --> 00:15:59,063
 He says 'I don't care, I'm not interested
to study, I'm not interested to go out,

94
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:04,875
 I'm not interested in doing
anything creative etc.'.

95
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:11,188
And then happens one shock in
his life, on the emotional level

96
00:16:11,292 --> 00:16:18,823
and this whole picture changes and
he becomes active, creative, enjoying

97
00:16:18,927 --> 00:16:23,188
life and everything.
What can this shock be?

98
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:27,750
-Falling in love.

99
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:38,781
-Falling in love, of course. Falling in love
can act on the emotional level and bring

100
00:16:38,885 --> 00:16:49,552
about a rearrangement of the whole
body and feels very very good.

101
00:16:49,656 --> 00:16:56,573
Life has a meaning again!

102
00:17:00,042 --> 00:17:03,656
The only problem is ...

103
00:17:04,042 --> 00:17:08,906
- Getting married !

104
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:25,885
-Yes, getting married, very good.
What is the real problem?

105
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:43,813
Unless you produce such a shock to cure
 you globally, to cure you group wise,

106
00:17:43,917 --> 00:17:56,167
 everybody is cured. The problem with falling
in love and becoming well is what?

107
00:17:58,042 --> 00:17:59,958
-To disappoint?

108
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:12,417
-It's the problem of dependency. This state depends on an external situation.

109
00:18:12,521 --> 00:18:20,240
It's like putting somebody who
 is worse in wet weather.

110
00:18:20,344 --> 00:18:36,469
He has pains and you take him and put him
in a very nice, dry environment. Ah, good !

111
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:45,042
As soon as you take him back
 to the wet condition....

112
00:18:48,656 --> 00:19:04,646
This state also is, I mean the modalities
 which are using this level also are,

113
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:19,104
what we call faith cures or spiritual cures.
Whatever, energy cures.

114
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:34,802
You remember from Christ, he says,
do you believe? You will be cured.

115
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:44,500
This is an effect on emotional level.

116
00:19:44,604 --> 00:19:56,531
You go to a spiritual healer.

117
00:19:56,635 --> 00:20:04,448
Do you think you can change your
condition unless you believe

118
00:20:04,552 --> 00:20:11,042
in that deep in yourself? The more
you believe, the more the effect will be.

119
00:20:11,146 --> 00:20:17,552
And then the healer comes, he touches
 you and you go ahh! the guru

120
00:20:17,656 --> 00:20:34,646
has touched me. I felt so good. Again
we have the dependency on that state,

121
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:43,833
 upon the relationship between the guru and
the disciple and how much he loves me

122
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:49,458
or he doesn't love me
 or he touches me etc. etc.

123
00:20:52,594 --> 00:20:57,865
So the spititual teacher acts
 upon the emotional level

124
00:20:57,969 --> 00:21:07,510
and how well the person feels
 is analogous to the faith

125
00:21:07,615 --> 00:21:14,198
and belief he has in his guru,
teacher or whatever.

126
00:21:14,302 --> 00:21:23,646
People can live next to a guru
for years feeling very good.

127
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:29,115
The moment they get a disappointment
from this particular guru,

128
00:21:29,219 --> 00:21:34,938
'I thought he was a saint and
I found out that he wasn't'

129
00:21:35,042 --> 00:21:42,948
then the whole system collapses
and then the problems reappear.

130
00:21:47,875 --> 00:22:01,833
So in the emotional level we have the
faith and love as positive emotions.

131
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:18,938
-But falling in love maybe sometimes is
 the beginning of building a real love,

132
00:22:19,042 --> 00:22:29,938
which is not just dependency but
interaction with support, which is good.

133
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:42,448
-That's what I said. In such a case,
the state of a better health will remain

134
00:22:42,552 --> 00:22:48,771
for many many years and it will be
 lost when the person is lost.

135
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:55,646
This is the case when people have
lived together for many years

136
00:22:55,750 --> 00:23:07,302
and then one dies and the other goes totally
to pieces and within few weeks, he also dies.

137
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:19,396
 It was a meaningful relation for those two persons, that means completing the needs.

138
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:27,646
It's like you lack a mineral and I have
the mineral, I lack a vitamin and

139
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,521
you have the vitamin, and I give you
the mineral, you give me the vitamin

140
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:39,417
 all the time and then we are in
balance and we go ahead etc.

141
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:49,448
I'm just talking to you because you have
 to understand the difference between

142
00:23:49,552 --> 00:23:57,042
the different therapeutic disciplines
that exist all around you,

143
00:23:57,792 --> 00:24:02,042
because you are going to be healers.
 Somebody will come and tell you

144
00:24:02,146 --> 00:24:08,521
 'I was better with this or that',
so you know what's happening

145
00:24:08,625 --> 00:24:17,219
 with that person, how deep he was
affected, why he was affected, etc.

146
00:24:17,323 --> 00:24:24,458
to be able to really help that
person more substantially.

147
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:41,271
The need to be loved is a situation where
does not bring a change in health.

148
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:52,021
It leaves you in a state of health which is
bad and it can become worse and worse.

149
00:24:53,792 --> 00:25:06,490
When I say 'I am in love', I mean that
feeling of inspiration, exaltation, whatever

150
00:25:06,594 --> 00:25:18,135
in which the other person also has
 a reciprocal feeling for you.

151
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:26,448
Otherwise the change can not happen.
If you fall in love and the other person

152
00:25:26,552 --> 00:25:36,448
 doesn't reciprocate... you found somebody
 you say fantastic... and after a week you say,

153
00:25:36,552 --> 00:25:43,854
what about going out? He says,
 I'm sorry I'm already engaged

154
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:57,448
... It was only for one week. It didn't last
very long because during this week,

155
00:25:57,552 --> 00:26:03,646
 you thought that the other
person is reciprocating.

156
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:13,552
The moment you found out she is not,
then back to the chronic state.

157
00:26:15,833 --> 00:26:30,313
But what you have to know is when there
is a reciprocal love, health can improve

158
00:26:30,417 --> 00:26:44,844
dramatically but not deep enough to
bring about a permanent cure.

159
00:26:44,948 --> 00:26:50,521
It will depend on the other person.

160
00:26:53,458 --> 00:27:05,531
I'm not against the gurus. What I say is, be aware of the workings of the human mind,

161
00:27:05,635 --> 00:27:12,042
emotions and body.
Try to understand how it works.

162
00:27:12,146 --> 00:27:19,167
How things are happening in this world concerning health and disease.

163
00:27:19,948 --> 00:27:27,885
I have seen, for instance, somebody
who says, 'ah you will be well',

164
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:34,448
because he believed, his friend loved him,
 whatever. You don't deny that, you don't say

165
00:27:34,552 --> 00:27:40,313
'oh, it's only Homeopathy it can do', no.
If you feel better, it's good.

166
00:27:43,948 --> 00:27:53,271
 We don't argue with these things. We understand how deep they can go,

167
00:27:53,375 --> 00:27:59,708
how long can last, this kind of cures.
And what is the difference between

168
00:27:59,813 --> 00:28:10,104
 these cures and the homeopathic cure.
 What is really to be healthy?

169
00:28:11,188 --> 00:28:20,979
We have to be absolutely sure when
we say that somebody is healthy.

170
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:24,354
Who is really healthy?

171
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:26,823
-Nobody.

172
00:28:26,927 --> 00:28:34,573
-Nobody, ok. Nobody has total health.
Let's be clear on that, at least.

173
00:28:37,167 --> 00:28:48,823
And we have therapists which affect
the physical level, which is the lowest,

174
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:59,344
 and which are, first of all, primarily,
the allopathic drugs.

175
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:10,115
All chemical drugs affect the physical level
 and from the physical level the action

176
00:29:10,219 --> 00:29:21,260
 is transferred to the
mental or the emotional.

177
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:28,688
In the same way that the affection of
the emotional can be transferred

178
00:29:28,792 --> 00:29:38,188
to physical or mental, is it clear?

179
00:29:41,573 --> 00:29:52,219
What else do we have in physical level?
All supplements. What else do we have?

180
00:29:52,906 --> 00:30:04,750
All herbs. Herbal remedies are affecting
 the physical level primarily

181
00:30:09,167 --> 00:30:20,604
and of course we have  the vaccinations
affecting the physical body very deeply.

182
00:30:20,708 --> 00:30:30,510
Why? Because vaccinations
 affect directly the defense mechanism.

183
00:30:30,615 --> 00:30:40,156
They go right to the core of the defence
of the human body and affect

184
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:45,906
the defence mechanism forcing
the mechanism to do

185
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:53,813
 certain things which are
not in order with nature.

186
00:30:55,302 --> 00:31:10,396
Saying all that, I do not mean you to
understand that I discard or throw away

187
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:21,521
all allopathic, herbal or vaccinations.
 It is not as simplistic as that.

188
00:31:23,104 --> 00:31:34,885
There are certain cases in which herbal
 remedies will help considerably;

189
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:44,448
there are other cases where allopathic
 medicine will help considerably

190
00:31:44,552 --> 00:32:01,604
and there are other cases
where physical measures, like surgery,

191
00:32:01,708 --> 00:32:19,021
can affect positively the human body.
I do not mean to just disregard everything;

192
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:27,063
to be clear about that ; not to give you
 the impression that George said,

193
00:32:27,167 --> 00:32:31,219
 'ah only Homeopathy and throw
everything out', no. I don't throw away

194
00:32:31,323 --> 00:32:36,177
the spiritual healing, I don't throw away
 the psychotherapy, I don't throw away

195
00:32:36,281 --> 00:32:47,646
all other measures. In certain cases even
with good homeopathic remedies,

196
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:57,115
you will need the support of some psychology
 or psychoanalysis, in some cases.

197
00:32:57,219 --> 00:33:10,708
In other cases, you will not be able to handle
 an infection with homeopathic remedy,

198
00:33:10,813 --> 00:33:20,896
 for instance Syphilis, where you cannot
play around with homeopathic remedy

199
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,573
for a long period of time,
 because Syphilis progresses quite fast,

200
00:33:26,677 --> 00:33:35,063
from one stage to another and goes to the tertiary Syphilis state where you have

201
00:33:35,167 --> 00:33:38,625
 the affect of  the nervous system
 and then you have problems.

202
00:33:38,729 --> 00:33:47,708
So, therefore to say let us try to see
if we can find a homeopathic remedy

203
00:33:48,104 --> 00:33:53,292
 in a Syphilis case,
 it's very very dangerous.

204
00:33:53,396 --> 00:34:03,958
You better give immediately the penicillin
 and after this treatment is gone,

205
00:34:04,063 --> 00:34:09,708
which you don't do it yourself,
you send them to the specialist.

206
00:34:09,812 --> 00:34:17,937
Then after that you try to bring about
the balance from the side effects

207
00:34:18,042 --> 00:34:21,187
of the treatment or whatever.

208
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:27,979
But treating primary Syphilis with
Homeopathy, because we have some

209
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:35,979
 records from old Homeopaths, who say
I treated Syphilis and I cured Syphilis.

210
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:49,969
In our literature we have these cases.
I never tried myself to treat primary Syphilis.

211
00:34:54,396 --> 00:35:07,396
You have also cases where you have
severe peritonitis. The peritoneum is

212
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:16,979
 in inflammed state and the danger of
 life is imminent and you don't see

213
00:35:17,083 --> 00:35:26,802
the right remedy clearly. You go and
 give the antibiotics, though in

214
00:35:26,906 --> 00:35:34,156
such cases of peritonitis, some cases
I have treated successfully.

215
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:45,104
But unless you find immediately the
first remedy correct, forget about the effect.

216
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:52,750
I once had a case of super infection on
an open eczema. The eczema was open,

217
00:35:52,854 --> 00:36:00,417
it was running and she washed dishes and
there was a super infection upon the eczema,

218
00:36:06,677 --> 00:36:15,844
 which we had left untreated because it was
 the result of a homeopathic treatment

219
00:36:15,948 --> 00:36:27,042
due to severe asthma. Asthma treated
and then that state came about.

220
00:36:27,146 --> 00:36:34,948
The eczema opened up and it was
 really running out.

221
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:42,083
The woman tried to wash the dishes,
it was a super infection, and she came

222
00:36:42,458 --> 00:37:01,344
with 39-40 degrees fever and she was red
from here all along and with high fever.

223
00:37:02,302 --> 00:37:06,750
You know what is that?

224
00:37:11,167 --> 00:37:14,885
-Sepsis.

225
00:37:18,281 --> 00:37:32,635
-Yes, septicemia is called. In 48 hours
 you may have the death of this patient.

226
00:37:36,615 --> 00:37:43,333
It is septicemia which is starting, going
up and in 48 hours she is gone.

227
00:37:43,438 --> 00:37:56,313
She came to Athens while I was going around treating patients from one room to another,

228
00:37:56,417 --> 00:38:02,979
you know I was entering a room, writing a remedy, next room, writing the remedy

229
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:08,979
and in the middle of this, she came
and said, 'look at me!'

230
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:18,375
I said, 'come to the kitchen' because all the
 other rooms were filled with patients.

231
00:38:18,479 --> 00:38:26,240
I see her and I say ok,
the remedy is Sulphur,

232
00:38:26,344 --> 00:38:34,635
I say to my secretary, give her Sulphur
50 M and I continue, go to the next room.

233
00:38:35,677 --> 00:38:46,354
This was on Friday night. Then I go to
my home to sleep by 12:00 at night

234
00:38:46,458 --> 00:39:01,167
when we finish, and I say to myself...
what have you done?

235
00:39:02,219 --> 00:39:12,802
I mean, I did not even take her
 telephone number to call.

236
00:39:12,906 --> 00:39:19,021
It was Saturday, the center
 was closed, Saturday and Sunday

237
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:32,156
and I had no contact with her.
 I could not sleep of course the whole night,

238
00:39:32,375 --> 00:39:35,625
Saturday I could not sleep,
on Sunday I could not sleep.

239
00:39:35,729 --> 00:39:41,937
On Monday I was finished, I go to the
 office thinking that most probably

240
00:39:42,042 --> 00:39:47,979
she had died and I said
'why are you stupid?'

241
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:56,510
You could tell her go and get some penicillin
and now you would be sleeping nicely.

242
00:39:56,615 --> 00:40:01,281
Ok, we cannot treat
everything and everyone.

243
00:40:02,219 --> 00:40:13,729
This is to show us the possibilities of Homeopathy. Fortunately for me,

244
00:40:13,833 --> 00:40:21,885
on Monday afternoon, she came
and said, 'look how well I am'.

245
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:32,708
I said, thank God that she had
this nice idea to come and tell me.

246
00:40:32,813 --> 00:40:42,594
Because by this time I was totally
 finished, in depression

247
00:40:42,792 --> 00:40:50,687
I was telling myself how stupid
you are, we cannot save everybody.

248
00:40:50,792 --> 00:41:01,729
And treating people, having
all the responsibility. It was fantastic.

249
00:41:01,833 --> 00:41:10,906
50M fortunately, the remedy was correctly potentised, because it could have not been

250
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:16,135
 correctly potentised and the
cure was fantastic.

251
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:24,885
She says, 'next day I was ok'. Yes, we
have this possibility but the remedy

252
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:30,885
has to be clear and we have to
 know what we are doing.

253
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:45,417
Always keep in contact. You cannot do it in
this stage. Don't do it in this stage, please.

254
00:41:47,167 --> 00:42:01,021
Penicillin it will save your sleep, you and
 the patient. So I don't disregard all,

255
00:42:01,125 --> 00:42:03,573
just to be clear about that.

256
00:42:03,677 --> 00:42:13,885
But extreme cases in which I have put
myself in the process of these 35-36 years

257
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:18,271
of doing Homeopathy, have shown
me the the possibilities we have with

258
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:23,104
Homeopathy, which is great.

259
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:31,604
But on the other hand we can't be stupid
and narrow minded and think that

260
00:42:31,708 --> 00:42:40,010
always we can treat with Homeopathy,
never mind if the patient is dead or alive.

261
00:42:42,344 --> 00:42:53,531
-Excuse me, if I may go back to the case
 of Syphilis. Isn't dangerous and

262
00:42:53,635 --> 00:43:00,125
driving the troubles deeper with antibiotics
 and maybe even confusing the case?

263
00:43:02,417 --> 00:43:10,604
-Well, it is better to confuse the case
rather than lose the case all together.

264
00:43:10,708 --> 00:43:22,958
Secondly, it has been found out that
penicillin will really manage to leave

265
00:43:23,063 --> 00:43:29,292
the person with very little problems
considering the big problems

266
00:43:29,396 --> 00:43:32,865
he would have,
if he was left untreated.

267
00:43:32,969 --> 00:43:38,688
So, we have to chose between few
problems, little problems, huge problems

268
00:43:38,792 --> 00:43:44,083
which will be unmanageable by anybody.

269
00:43:45,813 --> 00:43:55,208
Don't even try, at least I have not
tried ever with Syphilis.

270
00:44:03,833 --> 00:44:18,906
So, here you see all other treatments
are addressing themselves

271
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:28,729
either to the mental, emotional or physical.
 And through the try to affect the other levels.

272
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:33,708
Try to affect mental level
 through emotions etc.

273
00:44:35,438 --> 00:44:45,469
The difference with Homeopathy is
that we go beyond that to the real

274
00:44:45,573 --> 00:44:53,156
defence mechanism which is the
vital force and have an effect

275
00:44:53,219 --> 00:45:00,417
 upon the vital force which
connects these 3 levels.

276
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:07,354
By affecting the defence mechanism,
we have the rearrangement of

277
00:45:07,458 --> 00:45:16,792
all these levels and we have the
best possible result.

278
00:45:18,167 --> 00:45:26,938
In this same level, it works also, I believe,
 I don't know very much Acupuncture.

279
00:45:27,042 --> 00:45:34,260
Acupuncture works on this same level.
