1
00:00:00,873 --> 00:00:10,658
What is my function here is show you real cases.

2
00:00:12,378 --> 00:00:20,528
You will be seeing cases for the first time, like me, as if you were the doctor who takes the case.

3
00:00:24,975 --> 00:00:39,023
I have to explain to you a little bit, especially for the younger ones, what it means to take a homeopathic case.

4
00:00:43,927 --> 00:00:57,215
For those who are MDs they have learned the conventional way of taking the case.

5
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:10,440
The investigation which is performed by a MD is to find out what the diagnosis is,

6
00:01:11,048 --> 00:01:18,231
what is the pathology, what the patient suffers from and this is enough.

7
00:01:18,863 --> 00:01:21,463
You have rheumatoid arthritis.

8
00:01:22,679 --> 00:01:27,303
We know the treatment, cortisone, aspirin etc.

9
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:33,479
Or you have a spastic colitis etc.

10
00:01:36,167 --> 00:01:49,063
This is something which Homeopathy needs up to a certain extent, what the diagnosis is.

11
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:56,903
The patients who are coming to Homeopathy, they usually already have this diagnosis

12
00:01:58,487 --> 00:02:04,406
because they have been to different doctors and they have tried very hard to cure themselves,

13
00:02:06,663 --> 00:02:11,191
it was not possible and then they end up in a homeopath.

14
00:02:13,143 --> 00:02:21,008
This has been already investigated and comes ready to you.

15
00:02:21,688 --> 00:02:33,985
If there is a patient who has never had before any treatment you are going to make the diagnosis.

16
00:02:34,314 --> 00:02:59,177
That means you are going to use your knowledge in Medicine, lab tests and all the technical things which exist today which help in making the diagnosis and then you will start the homeopathic investigation.

17
00:03:01,346 --> 00:03:22,928
What we want to understand from a human organism is his reactions to external and internal stresses.

18
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:40,848
We have to find in which way the organism reacts.

19
00:03:41,336 --> 00:03:54,168
We will hear a homeopath asking peculiar questions which are not usually asked in a medical consultation.

20
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:11,857
For instance, if a patient takes his feet out of covers during sleep.

21
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:26,160
You say for god’s sake I have colitis or rheumatoid arthritis, what does it mean if I take my feet out or not? For Homeopathy this becomes very important information.

22
00:04:28,728 --> 00:04:41,417
We know from all physiology information that the thermostat of the body is the big toe.

23
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:51,841
This is the thermostat which regulates the internal temperature of the organism.

24
00:04:53,274 --> 00:05:06,545
So, if an organism during sleep is heated due to external conditions, has to regulate itself immediately,

25
00:05:07,144 --> 00:05:23,352
otherwise this rising of the internal temperature will cause a damage to it so automatically the organism needs to cool down and the patient takes out his feet.

26
00:05:29,545 --> 00:05:31,857
Otherwise there is a problem.

27
00:05:32,017 --> 00:05:36,168
We cannot say which problem, but definitely there is going to be a problem.

28
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,904
I'll give you another example.

29
00:05:43,034 --> 00:05:59,424
For instance we take into consideration whether a patient has an organism which is easily heated up by external condition.

30
00:05:59,864 --> 00:06:05,880
If it is warm he cannot tolerate it and takes off his clothes etc.

31
00:06:07,745 --> 00:06:26,209
Because if he does not do that he is going to have repercussion, his blood pressure will rise, he may even have a brain stroke, or if he is outside under the sun he will have sunstroke.

32
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:42,305
In the seaside there are 30 people lying under the sun and one has sunstroke.

33
00:06:44,824 --> 00:07:01,569
We want to know what is the difference in this organism that external heat rises the internal temperature to such a degree that becomes unconscious.

34
00:07:08,232 --> 00:07:11,016
I'll give you another example.

35
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:21,504
We all know people complaining when the weather is wet.

36
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:34,857
Once there is wet weather I am stiff, I have lumbago or I have problems.

37
00:07:36,976 --> 00:08:03,016
Why is that? It is because the tissues of the body are always containing the right consistency of water, minerals etc.

38
00:08:05,056 --> 00:08:18,744
So an organism that is sensitive to wet weather absorbs water from the environment.

39
00:08:19,584 --> 00:08:42,912
As a result we have excessive water within the tissues and the cells and then the tissues become watery, weak and then he says I have a lumbago.

40
00:08:44,233 --> 00:08:56,785
A lumbago is the tendency of the organism to go out of alignment of the spine.

41
00:08:57,064 --> 00:09:32,396
The moment that the tissues which hold the body straight become weak because of excess water within the cells, then it is easy to go out of alignment and there is a lumbago and sciatica.

42
00:09:37,982 --> 00:09:57,966
Whether a person is sensitive to the external as it is today, today is a very wet day, it is very important for us to understand the organism how it functions.

43
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:36,430
On the contrary another organism who does not receive extra
water that means is lacking the absolute good quantity

44
00:10:36,998 --> 00:10:51,686
of water within the cell when there is a lot of water
outside, the atmosphere is wet, he feels very good.

45
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:59,198
He says if I am in a wet weather I am in my best.

46
00:11:01,062 --> 00:11:14,118
Because his absorption process cannot absorb the amount of water the organism needs in order to have the exact amount that the organism needs.

47
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:29,014
The organism regulates itself every moment in all elements, vitamins, water etc.

48
00:11:29,302 --> 00:11:33,206
that needs to have its best performance.

49
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:57,189
The problem is that the organism cannot do it because of malfunction of the alimentary canal, guts, liver, gallbladder etc.

50
00:11:57,598 --> 00:12:05,398
Cannot absorb certain elements.

51
00:12:05,806 --> 00:12:10,758
He has been damaged and cannot absorb certain elements.

52
00:12:12,551 --> 00:12:24,767
You will hear a question from a homeopath saying "do you eat onion?".

53
00:12:26,974 --> 00:12:54,959
You say what is he talking about? The problem is that the general medicine has not realized the importance of the microelements which the organism needs in order to balance itself.

54
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:13,510
So onion contains a lot of sulfur.

55
00:13:17,438 --> 00:13:43,150
If an organism has difficulty in absorbing sulfur or its composites calcarea sulfurica, kali sulfuricum etc then when you ask the patient do you like onions

56
00:13:45,093 --> 00:14:02,269
he will say "Oh my God yes! I want onion from the morning till the night!" There is a need for onions…

57
00:14:21,638 --> 00:14:41,118
In the children who are growing and they need a lot of calcium to build up their skeleton structure because their skeleton is growing fast and they need a lot of calcium.

58
00:14:41,718 --> 00:14:51,206
So what the children mostly need is food which is rich in calcium.

59
00:14:52,470 --> 00:15:17,855
Which food is rich in calcium primarily? Milk which he takes from the mother, milky products and what else when the child becomes one year old?

60
00:15:18,022 --> 00:15:37,598
There is some food which the child badly needs and you may find out that the food the child eats very easily is eggs.

61
00:15:38,406 --> 00:15:42,846
Because eggs contain a lot of calcium.

62
00:15:43,286 --> 00:16:00,351
So if we see a child with a special desire for eggs and milk we realize his calcium intake is not good enough.

63
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:12,551
Therefore he needs regulation on this level.

64
00:16:13,438 --> 00:16:23,629
But the child has come for dyspnea or asthmatic condition or constant diarrheas.

65
00:16:24,054 --> 00:16:25,734
It doesn't matter.

66
00:16:26,366 --> 00:16:49,734
The lack of calcium brings about a disturbance in the organism that will express itself in the most weak part of the organism.

67
00:16:50,694 --> 00:16:58,949
Which is the weak part of the organism? The respiratory system and will express itself in a respiratory disorder.

68
00:16:59,334 --> 00:17:21,790
By getting colds very easily, the child gets cold very easily and the cough stays to the bronchi and sometimes he ends up even in pneumonia.

69
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:34,038
Due to the fact that his absorption of calcium is inefficient.

70
00:17:41,990 --> 00:18:08,621
The homeopath is trying to find this deeper reason for the pathology of the child in order to correct it and then the colitis of the child, the respiratory problems of the child resolve...

71
00:18:22,854 --> 00:18:27,726
You mean if you take the examinations of the child.

72
00:18:28,046 --> 00:18:35,574
Whether calcium low intake will be seen in the blood of the child...

73
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:58,742
Most laboratory examination will say from so much to so much, the highest, is normal.

74
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:11,767
A little bit out of this area is abnormal but actually for this organism there is only one normal.

75
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:15,286
It is not from here to here normal.

76
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,598
Let us say we have from 1 to 10.

77
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:29,887
For this organism the normal is 7, for the other organism the normal is 9 and for this organism the normal is 5.

78
00:19:30,414 --> 00:19:48,014
The fact that the calcium level goes up to 3 for this organism it means damage.

79
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:56,910
Eventually you will find out that the organism will produce damage.

80
00:20:01,398 --> 00:20:05,869
That means the child gets colds easily.

81
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:12,950
This cannot be seen in these examinations from lowest to highest.

82
00:20:13,566 --> 00:20:25,798
Because the child's calcium level is from 8-10.5.

83
00:20:28,974 --> 00:20:54,998
You see the child the child which is in 8.2 and is normal but it is not normal, the child craves for calcium, drinks milk, eggs, especially soft boiled eggs.

84
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:11,287
It has been proven that if you boil the egg and you make it hard some portion of the calcium in the eggs is lost.

85
00:21:12,302 --> 00:21:18,509
That why the child wants soft-boiled eggs.

86
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:22,614
When you give them he takes them.

87
00:21:23,894 --> 00:21:34,790
It's such an important issue among others and it has been ignored in conventional medicine.

88
00:21:35,302 --> 00:21:36,798
Totally.

89
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:44,118
The pediatrician doesn't even ask and or know.

90
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:54,909
They say give him this but if I force the child to eat this he says no and spits it out.

91
00:21:56,862 --> 00:21:59,478
No, you have to give it.

92
00:22:00,622 --> 00:22:16,590
That means you provide elements to this organism which the organism fully receives and has aversion.

93
00:22:16,926 --> 00:22:32,022
If the intake of calcium in a child is enough from all foods, if you give him eggs he will spit it.

94
00:22:37,694 --> 00:22:40,030
So it goes both ways.

95
00:22:40,334 --> 00:22:43,581
Desire and also aversion for eggs.

96
00:22:46,550 --> 00:23:13,366
Eggs can become like poison in an organism that is anemic because we don't realize that the organism has its own intelligence and regulated everything, all the intakes and non-takes.

97
00:23:13,966 --> 00:23:21,445
I don't like this, don't give me this food because it becomes like poison to me.

98
00:23:26,366 --> 00:23:30,662
Like the example of onions and sulfur.

99
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:47,710
If an organism takes a lot of sulfur and doesn't need this, if you give him onions he says that his stomach takes 2 days to digest it.

100
00:23:49,686 --> 00:24:09,590
I feel aversion but if you force him just to see what happens I have distention, dysphoria, my breath became bad; I feel very bad if I take onions.

101
00:24:12,406 --> 00:24:20,406
The human intelligence is different and very restricted.

102
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:26,158
You say this is good for the child, you do this and that.

103
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:46,590
But who really knows? Is there any human brain that can enter an organism and by super-wisdom understand what is good or bad? It's not possible.

104
00:24:47,862 --> 00:25:02,566
But yet Hahnemann said we have been given a way to understand what is happening in an organism by the symptoms.

105
00:25:07,374 --> 00:25:21,782
Take the totality of the symptoms, take all the symptoms down and you will understand what is going on with this organism and only then you can correct it.

106
00:25:30,591 --> 00:25:40,711
This is a tragedy that the whole of medicine has not understood this idea.

107
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:58,742
You know originally whose idea is this? This  idea first time was given very clearly by Hippocrates.

108
00:26:00,438 --> 00:26:13,470
He says "δια τα όμοια νόσος γίνεται";with the similars we produce disease.

109
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:17,845
"Δια τα όμοια προφερόμενα εκ νοσευόντων υγειαίνονται".

110
00:26:18,181 --> 00:26:28,637
By giving the similar you bring the patient from disease to health.

111
00:26:31,813 --> 00:26:59,901
He said there are 2 ways to treat; one by opposites that means you are having fever I give you a anti-fever remedy, so I suppress the fever and the fever goes.

112
00:27:02,517 --> 00:27:13,710
That means you burn you hand and if you put it into cold water the pain will stop.

113
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:21,852
The pain will stop but what happens afterwards?

114
00:27:24,261 --> 00:27:39,877
There is a tremendous blister and he has noticed that if you burn your hand and you want to cure it don't put it in cold because you will have side effects.

115
00:27:42,562 --> 00:27:53,258
Put it back in the fire, not to burn yourself totally
but to have enough heat, to give heat back, so the

116
00:27:55,978 --> 00:28:11,546
organism will get out of that situation slowly and you
may be spared of the blisters and the aftereffects.

117
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:39,097
In WWII here in Greece where soldiers were fighting in snowy areas in the mountains, a lot of them because of bad shoes, they had frostbites.

118
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:44,674
They became blue.

119
00:28:45,194 --> 00:28:53,594
Those who did not know they went and put the frostbites to the heat.

120
00:28:54,034 --> 00:29:02,819
Those who did this they developed gangrene and their legs got amputated.

121
00:29:03,346 --> 00:29:32,882
But then soon the soldiers learned that once you have a frostbite treated with snow, you go and take some snow and then slowly put on some snow little by little, your leg doesn't go to gangrene.

122
00:29:33,978 --> 00:29:39,754
And they were saved, a lot of them by treating with similars.

123
00:29:42,066 --> 00:29:49,594
So these are few examples, there are hundreds of that type.

124
00:29:51,594 --> 00:29:56,522
But what it means for us...

125
00:29:59,458 --> 00:30:11,626
The little symptom, any symptom that a person has it has its explanation and physiology.

126
00:30:14,594 --> 00:30:40,034
When somebody comes and tells you I have a dysuria, difficulty in urination, there is a pathology which explains why this man cannot urinate properly.

127
00:30:43,458 --> 00:31:04,602
How do you differentiate between a stricture in the urethra or a swelling of the prostate gland which is the most usual?

128
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:24,970
How do you differentiate that this kind of dysuria that this man has is of a different type than the other one which can be cancerous?

129
00:31:28,578 --> 00:31:41,878
All this information will be given by the totality of the symptoms that the organism is presenting in front of you.

130
00:31:45,630 --> 00:32:11,902
The totality of the symptoms means, in other words, it the language of the defense
mechanism which is beyond the reticuloendothelial system or the hormonal system

131
00:32:12,413 --> 00:32:21,942
or the different other immune systems that we have known in the Medicine.

132
00:32:22,342 --> 00:32:35,726
It is an intelligence which is beyond that which sees in the totality the whole reaction of the organism.

133
00:32:38,886 --> 00:32:55,942
Why is there dysuria and at the same time there is lachrymation of the right eye?

134
00:32:56,998 --> 00:33:15,142
Who can put this together and at the same time why is there in this organism a lack of thirst?

135
00:33:19,342 --> 00:33:44,573
And why at the same in this organism there is constipation? And why at the same time this organism when he goes upstairs, 10-20 steps becomes like this?

136
00:33:45,766 --> 00:34:04,846
All this becomes a totality together with some others which you cannot understand even if you are the most intelligent brain in the world, a computer or whatever.

137
00:34:05,238 --> 00:34:10,502
You will never understand why there is this reaction and not the other.

138
00:34:10,886 --> 00:34:14,405
Why this organism needs a lot of water.

139
00:34:15,877 --> 00:34:24,118
He says give me water but I need water with ice.

140
00:34:29,478 --> 00:34:37,765
Why does he need this very cold water? We know the remedy...

141
00:34:39,374 --> 00:35:11,550
Phosphorus which needs cold water and because we know what is the most probable pathology of Phosphorus which is the easy
bleeding, the peripheral arterioles of the organism of a Phosphorus case are breaking up easily and they open up and they bleed.

142
00:35:12,478 --> 00:35:27,278
So the patient will tell you I have been bleeding, I have nose bleedings since childhood and I need very cold water.

143
00:35:30,846 --> 00:36:09,688
Because the cold water makes the arteries, especially in the stomach, constrict, they do not allow relaxation.

144
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:22,920
If it breaks the bleeding of the nose will be transferred to the stomach.

145
00:36:23,577 --> 00:36:44,024
That is why the organism says don't give me hot water, because by hot water the arterioles will relax and break up and I will have a big problem, bleeding of the stomach.

146
00:36:45,208 --> 00:36:59,401
Now in the hospitals they know a little bit of these things we know and they say give me him cold applications, cold water...

147
00:37:01,464 --> 00:37:07,320
don't give hot things in a patient who is bleeding from his stomach.

148
00:37:08,048 --> 00:37:10,208
They know it from experience.

149
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:16,160
We have a better knowledge and a deeper knowledge of pathology.

150
00:37:17,897 --> 00:37:28,657
Because we have studied all possible reactions of the organism.

151
00:37:30,096 --> 00:37:38,592
There is no reaction of an individual who is not registered in our Materia Medica.

152
00:37:42,032 --> 00:38:00,008
It has registered the different pathologies which are produced by different remedies when they have been given in healthy individuals.

153
00:38:03,736 --> 00:38:08,376
You are going to hear much more about that, much more explanation.

154
00:38:08,689 --> 00:38:21,713
But what I want you to understand at this moment is, because I will be taking real cases, patients who are suffering,

155
00:38:22,544 --> 00:38:36,960
and you will hear me asking questions which some of you especially those who come for the first time will not understand.

156
00:38:37,808 --> 00:38:50,024
Why he wants to know all this? Why I want to know all this is not so much because I want to understand the pathology, for this also,

157
00:38:50,832 --> 00:39:18,753
but what I'm trying to do is to collect information for the organism and at the same in the back of my
mind or in the computer today, we have all the information of the pathology that is produced by medicine.

158
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:23,928
All medicines produce pathology.

159
00:39:24,072 --> 00:39:34,481
If you take antibiotics everyday for a month you will have a pathology in the end, having a certain set of symptoms.

160
00:39:37,553 --> 00:40:00,024
If we wanted to use antibiotics as a remedy what would we do? We would collect all the possible side effects of antibiotics in all cases, in this case it produced stomach problems,

161
00:40:01,417 --> 00:40:10,121
in this case it produced kidney problems of that type, this produced liver problems etc.

162
00:40:10,265 --> 00:40:19,249
We would collect all this information of the side effects and then we would have a remedy we call a antibiotic of a specific type

163
00:40:19,841 --> 00:40:36,632
and if we have a case with similar pathology then we would use the antibiotics but in a very minute dose.

164
00:40:39,064 --> 00:40:43,488
Absolutely small dose.

165
00:40:47,033 --> 00:40:56,641
What you will see happening, you will the see reacting to this very minute dose.

166
00:40:57,496 --> 00:41:03,624
It reacts in such a way as to bring about balance again.

167
00:41:08,545 --> 00:41:12,480
I will give you a short explanation how this happens.

168
00:41:14,888 --> 00:41:35,376
In pathology all the symptoms of a patient are its effort to bring about balance, a cure.

169
00:41:36,032 --> 00:41:46,712
An organism wants to be cured and that's why it produces a set of symptoms.

170
00:41:55,457 --> 00:42:16,424
His intelligence is such that he says if I make an effort and I will detonate the electrical imbalance in the organism by an epileptic fit.

171
00:42:18,992 --> 00:42:42,240
The type epileptic fit which detonates the electrical imbalance of the organism, this type is the best this organism can do to rebalance his electrical discharges.

172
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:52,712
It can do no better.

173
00:42:53,256 --> 00:43:04,161
He's an epileptic and once in a week he has an epileptic fit or once in month or once in a year.

174
00:43:05,433 --> 00:43:12,032
This is an effort at this moment to rebalance the organism.

175
00:43:16,264 --> 00:43:39,400
If an organism is invaded by bacteria, all bacteria are existing in the organism, and then we say that the organism is invaded.

176
00:43:40,257 --> 00:43:53,817
What does it mean? It means the organism at a certain point becomes a good ground for the developing of those specific bacteria.

177
00:43:55,092 --> 00:44:00,563
The bacteria cannot come outside all the time.

178
00:44:00,787 --> 00:44:22,371
If the constitution of the organisms lowers itself in immunity, it prepares the ground for allowing the streptococcus or the staphylococcus to develop in a great degree.

179
00:44:23,075 --> 00:44:32,196
Once this staphylococcus is spreading within the blood then there is a time when the organism says wait, it is dangerous.

180
00:44:33,244 --> 00:44:50,740
So what I have to do is raise the temperature to burn these invaders, like fire.

181
00:44:52,371 --> 00:45:01,612
Actually it raises the fever in order to kill the bacteria.

182
00:45:02,124 --> 00:45:21,356
And that is why certain bacteria are killed when the organism reaches 40,2 degrees while some, other 39,5 degrees etc.

183
00:45:51,948 --> 00:45:52,122
Now that bacteria are modified due to antibiotics some others cannot be actually burned out,
that means the organism raises the temperature but if you allow him to be like that he will die.

184
00:45:52,536 --> 00:45:55,313
In pneumonia this is what happens.

185
00:45:56,345 --> 00:46:13,537
There is always a percentage in pneumonia, in the old times it was 20%, 20% of pneumonia cases would die, today depending on the age is maybe 5%.

186
00:46:19,073 --> 00:46:28,145
This is not actually a total victory of antibiotics.

187
00:46:28,698 --> 00:46:39,402
Antibiotics are useful, don't misunderstand me, in certain cases, in septicemia, pneumonia etc.

188
00:46:40,313 --> 00:46:43,968
The antibiotics will save the life of the person.

189
00:46:45,593 --> 00:47:15,738
But the life of the person who is not in a condition to face the problem itself, if the organism cannot face the invasion of bacteria himself by allowing him to raise the fever up to the point he wants

190
00:47:16,065 --> 00:47:32,985
and then he will survive the organism and then bacteria will die but there are organisms who cannot survive a very high temperature,

191
00:47:33,409 --> 00:47:50,209
in such cases the antibiotics who are targeting in not allowing the bacteria to spread may be life-saving but with side effects.

192
00:47:53,064 --> 00:48:09,633
This is when the organism compromises and says I will not go to the end, I will not die but I will become chronically ill.

193
00:48:12,945 --> 00:48:32,737
That is why from sinusitis of an aggressive type, when antibiotics are fully given in order to cure it eventually we may see asthmatic conditions developing.

194
00:48:38,361 --> 00:48:40,473
I come back to the idea.

195
00:48:40,681 --> 00:48:58,697
The organism produces symptoms, raises the fever, the cough, the cough must bring out the mucus which has been collected for a reason.

196
00:48:59,137 --> 00:49:19,592
The mucus has been collected in order to reduce the development of local bacteria so there is mucus in order to kill the local bacteria and if there is a lot of mucus that stays the lungs will collapse,

197
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:28,761
the bronchi will collapse and the person will die of suffocation.

198
00:49:29,009 --> 00:49:32,721
That's why the organism brings on the idea of cough.

199
00:49:32,977 --> 00:49:38,224
Coughs and brings out the mucus in order to release.

200
00:49:38,754 --> 00:49:46,593
The mucus starts again collecting because there is a local problem and it has to reduce it etc.

201
00:49:51,409 --> 00:50:05,465
What I want to show you is that the symptoms of the organism are useful in order to cure itself.

202
00:50:07,145 --> 00:50:27,169
Since they are useful what should we do? Suppress them or promote them, give them an extra push? The whole idea of Homeopathy lies in this.

203
00:50:29,161 --> 00:51:12,265
But how can you find a substance that can act like the organism? We have tried and tested remedies and we have recorded their action and then the
action of arsenicum of producing diarrheas is the same or similar with the diarrheas produced by a poisonous food which the person has taken.

204
00:51:15,145 --> 00:51:24,361
He takes a poisonous with bacteria, he goes home and tremendous diarrhea starts.

205
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:32,761
This kind of diarrhea in toxicology we know it is produced by arsenicum.

206
00:51:33,113 --> 00:51:54,569
By giving arsenicum, of course if you give pure arsenicum you will kill the patient, he already has his symptoms, arsenicum has his symptoms you do not give a high quantity, you have a minute dose.

207
00:51:55,705 --> 00:52:06,897
Once that minute dose touches the sensitivity of the organism it will cure the diarrhea within a few hours.

208
00:52:08,777 --> 00:52:20,993
If you try to give suppressive drugs to stop the diarrhea it may take several days and still with a lot of side effects.

209
00:52:21,489 --> 00:52:23,433
This is the big difference.

210
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:33,849
I see you are very tired today and I have spoken too much.

211
00:52:36,145 --> 00:52:43,457
If you like you can ask a question.

212
00:52:54,097 --> 00:52:56,153
- Hello.

213
00:52:56,465 --> 00:52:57,753
Nice meeting you.

214
00:52:58,841 --> 00:53:08,817
You told that story about calcium, eggs and milk, dairy product.

215
00:53:10,417 --> 00:53:26,777
You said a certain person Calcarea Carbonnica will manifest lung disease because of his predisposition but his predisposition is also lack of calcium.

216
00:53:27,409 --> 00:53:31,249
That bad mechanism who doesn't allow absorb the calcium.

217
00:53:32,577 --> 00:53:36,529
These are two paths?

218
00:53:36,873 --> 00:53:41,865
- No this is the total picture.

219
00:53:42,281 --> 00:54:02,473
This organism because of lack of intake of calcium has a picture of lung disease or whatever that becomes one picture but how do you find the remedy that you have to give?

220
00:54:02,833 --> 00:54:50,362
Not by investigating only the lung by x rays, auscultate etc, you may have all this information as a pediatrician and then if
there is dyspnea you give theophylline or whatever for releasing the bronchodilators in general, sometimes you give cortisone...

221
00:54:51,497 --> 00:54:57,432
This is a part of the picture.

222
00:54:57,929 --> 00:55:12,857
For the full picture you go deeper and you find out the child needs a lot of calcium, you realize calcium intake is in default and then you prescribe calcarea carbonica.

223
00:55:13,529 --> 00:55:18,697
The picture is full, both taken into consideration.

224
00:55:19,217 --> 00:55:37,993
- What I meant...this part of lack of calcium, this bronchomechanism is a miasmatic predisposition and the other one with the lung disease only a genetic predisposition.

225
00:55:38,481 --> 00:55:40,017
It's a different thing?

226
00:55:40,761 --> 00:55:43,385
- The miasmatic and the genetic...

227
00:55:43,753 --> 00:55:45,784
You are progressing too much.

228
00:55:51,345 --> 00:56:06,025
We have not spoken about miasms and the idea of miasms so it is a question which can be answered later on when the whole class will have heard about the idea of miasm and the predisposition.

229
00:56:06,281 --> 00:56:16,130
What I can say here only is that genetic predisposition always comes from the two parents.

230
00:56:16,657 --> 00:56:26,457
For us all diseases are genetically inherited by the parents.

231
00:56:28,105 --> 00:56:43,417
Because in conventional medicine they say epilepsy is perhaps only inherited or psoriasis is inherited and other diseases are not.No.

232
00:56:43,689 --> 00:56:51,125
Every disease each one of us has come from the mixture of the two parents.

233
00:56:51,645 --> 00:57:00,620
It is a predisposition but not directly from the one or the other but from the mixture of the two parents.

234
00:57:00,885 --> 00:57:15,732
That means the child who comes with psoriasis which the father has, she may have it much more
that the father or much less than the father, the much less from the father means that his mother

235
00:57:15,924 --> 00:57:37,036
was in a better condition than the father when the father got married, the mother was in a
very good condition so the child took the predisposition from the father but to a mild degree.

236
00:57:37,828 --> 00:57:49,476
On the contrary, the mother was neurotic mother and the father had psoriasis, the child might appear much worse psoriasis.

237
00:57:53,108 --> 00:58:00,908
He may not be neurotic like the mother but all the impact is taken in the psoriasis in the level of the skin.- Hello.

238
00:58:20,597 --> 00:58:26,948
You talked about producing mucus in pneumonia, bronchitis.

239
00:58:27,876 --> 00:58:30,220
So this is normal...

240
00:58:30,557 --> 00:58:45,220
Every one of us produces mucus in a order to overcome the bacterial disease but some people may produce which is not easily expectorated.

241
00:58:47,452 --> 00:59:00,284
This shows us maybe a remedy but this is not healthy, I cannot understand how this symptom is useful.

242
00:59:03,996 --> 00:59:15,069
- There is a tickling in the trachea and the person has to cough.

243
00:59:15,701 --> 00:59:28,605
The tickling means that some area in the trachea or in the larynx is inflamed.

244
00:59:29,084 --> 00:59:31,748
There is a little inflammation.

245
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:49,485
Tickling is like a skin eruption, an eczema when it is very itchy, what is the natural thing you do, scratch it.

246
00:59:49,877 --> 00:59:59,069
By scratching it relieves the pain, the itching.

247
00:59:59,452 --> 01:00:06,084
It's the same thing with the coughing without mucus.

248
01:00:08,468 --> 01:00:22,397
This organism either will produce mucus and the cough and then in the end mucus will come and then most probably you will see the end of the problem...

249
01:00:24,317 --> 01:00:31,612
And it is well known that in a dry cough when it becomes loose it's a good sign.

250
01:00:33,292 --> 01:00:47,596
That means until the organism is able to bring out, complete its defense, then he has to do whatever is possible to relieve itself.

251
01:00:49,277 --> 01:00:55,188
Cannot cure it but has to do something to relieve himself.

252
01:00:55,580 --> 01:01:14,076
So the dry coughing is like scratching in a place where it is itching until the
inflammation becomes too much and then mucus comes and the mucus comes out or the

253
01:01:17,309 --> 01:01:40,436
overall problem is over and the organism has rearranged the elements that has to take
in order to fight that particular inflammation and then the problem will be over.

254
01:01:41,255 --> 01:01:49,198
There will be cough for some days and then it stops without ever bringing mucus.

255
01:01:49,551 --> 01:01:56,047
That means the inflammation was not of that severe type.

256
01:01:57,735 --> 01:02:28,759
Another theory I have spoken about and I have brought out for the Medicine in general is my theory that all diseases are of inflammatory type.

257
01:02:31,543 --> 01:02:51,750
Some are with high temperatures but once this is suppressed then we have a sub-acute inflammation process that is going on all the time for all chronic diseases.

258
01:02:59,423 --> 01:03:13,007
Later on you will learn an idea which I brought out of observation when the organism reaches the point where he will be able to raise fever it's in a good condition.

259
01:03:23,255 --> 01:03:35,247
I will show you a case in the afternoon and I will try to explain during the taking of the case what I am trying to do.

260
01:03:37,143 --> 01:03:38,735
Thank you!
