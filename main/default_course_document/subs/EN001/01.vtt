WEBVTT

00:54.340 --> 01:18.870
So the grand rule on Homeopathy is 
Similia Similibus Curentur.

01:20.240 --> 01:36.070
This is the grand rule which means
 that a remedy can cure if fits, 

01:36.170 --> 01:40.950
if it is similar with the pathology of the case.

01:42.980 --> 01:52.210
So, that means we have remedies 
that we know their pathology. 

02:00.560 --> 02:06.760
I want you to understand why such 
a thing is happening.

02:07.640 --> 02:18.880
When you have a disease, 
you have a symptomatology.

02:20.160 --> 02:29.130
This symptomatology is the result of a 
defence mechanism who is trying 

02:29.230 --> 02:33.390
to re-establish itself into order.

02:33.490 --> 02:41.280
To bring back order into the organism
through that symptomatology.

02:41.960 --> 02:48.050
So the symptomatology is a useful thing
 for the organism and the symptoms 

02:48.150 --> 02:59.500
are absolutely necessary for that particular
organism in order to stay in balance, not to die.

02:59.650 --> 03:10.920
So we respect the symptoms of a patient whether in acute or in a chronic state.

03:11.240 --> 03:23.160
We respect very much this symptomatology
 and we try to write down 

03:23.260 --> 03:29.310
all the symptoms of the case 
and then try to find which is the remedy,

03:29.410 --> 03:38.650
 which has in its pathogenesis when 
it was proven in the healthy organism,

03:39.650 --> 03:48.910
we try to find which is the similium, which 
is exactly that remedy that fits the totality.

03:51.190 --> 04:03.160
And then if you are given this, the patient
 is cured. Why this happens? 

04:05.040 --> 04:08.380
Here we have a graph, right?

04:15.640 --> 04:23.130
These are symptoms, strong 
symptoms of the patient, 

04:23.830 --> 04:33.730
here we have a very high fever 
with its modalities.

04:33.830 --> 04:39.470
Fever which comes in the afternoon 
 4-5 pm, fever which comes 

04:39.570 --> 04:44.080
only in the morning, fever in the 
evening, constant fever, whatever.

04:45.570 --> 04:57.320
But fever is not the only symptom. He can 
have also headache, strong headache,

05:01.290 --> 05:09.930
headache with its modalities, we write them down exactly, the modalities of the fever.

05:10.100 --> 05:25.940
And then we have exhaustion, tremendous exhaustion and then we have 

05:26.040 --> 05:33.440
together with these fever, exhaustion etc. 
we have coughing.

05:36.110 --> 05:48.840
And then here we have excessive thirst 
and then here we have nightmares.

05:52.880 --> 06:01.800
So you are searching to find a remedy
 with fever with a specific modality, 

06:01.900 --> 06:02.900
do you understand modality?

06:03.000 --> 06:09.460
Anybody does not understand 
some words, I'm using words 

06:09.560 --> 06:17.780
which are used in Homeopathy and 
I suppose that everyone understands them.

06:17.880 --> 06:22.540
If somebody does not understand, 
he has to ask so you can follow 

06:22.640 --> 06:29.770
step by step everything. Otherwise 
it's not good, you just follow, follow, 

06:29.870 --> 06:35.630
follow and then a confusion is created, ok?

06:37.120 --> 06:42.610
We try to find a remedy that has fever, that 
has a particular headache we are looking for, 

06:42.710 --> 06:48.110
which has a particular exhaustion, 
which has the coughing, nightmares etc.

06:48.210 --> 06:55.980
 So that means it will be a remedy similar.

07:01.760 --> 07:09.780
 The remedy will have more 
or less a graph like this.

07:13.960 --> 07:25.260
If the exhaustion is very great, then
 it will have a graph like this. 

07:25.360 --> 07:31.980
So the most characteristic of this patient 
is the exhaustion he is totally exhausted, 

07:32.080 --> 07:38.130
then the remedy has to have exhaustion
 in very great degree also. 

07:40.050 --> 07:49.590
So for each symptom we have 
intensity and modalities.

07:49.720 --> 08:00.000
How intensive is and what 
modifies this symptom.

08:08.790 --> 08:22.710
If we give a similar remedy, the patient will
 be cured. There is a logic behind this. 

08:22.810 --> 08:28.400
There is a very, very clear logic.

08:33.150 --> 08:42.520
Can anybody know why? Can you tell me
 why if you give a similar remedy 

08:42.620 --> 08:49.040
- that means the symptoms - I’m going 
to be worse, not better.

08:50.240 --> 08:58.940
The symptoms are going to be worse 
because this organism produces this graph 

08:59.040 --> 09:03.700
that means this symptomatology 
as a reaction to what?

09:03.800 --> 09:13.670
To a bacteria, a virus or whatever. 
So a bacteria has invaded my body 

09:13.770 --> 09:18.490
or has developed within my body
and then the organism in order to 

09:18.590 --> 09:29.500
counteract this invasion produces symptoms. And then I come and I give a remedy 

09:29.600 --> 09:35.220
which has similar symptoms. At this point 
we have to be very clear because 

09:35.320 --> 09:37.780
when we explain Homeopathy we 
have to explain it in this way 

09:37.880 --> 09:46.420
that makes sense to the patient, to ourselves 
to understand what we are doing and this

09:46.520 --> 09:55.400
understanding is useful for later on when you evaluate that case, what has happened.

09:55.950 --> 10:00.730
Shall I give another remedy, shall
 I wait, what is this, what is that. 

10:02.440 --> 10:05.950
Do I give a remedy for one symptom?

10:06.270 --> 10:12.000
I mean these questions are going to be 
solved if you understand very clearly 

10:12.100 --> 10:16.520
the mechanism of cure.

10:20.860 --> 10:31.820
So my question to you is why this 
remedy is going to cure this patient 

10:31.920 --> 10:36.600
and not make him worse?

10:44.250 --> 10:47.720
There is a clear logic behind.

10:47.850 --> 10:57.100
 The explanation is this. If the organism
 tries to bring about a cure through

10:57.200 --> 11:04.110
developing this symptomatology 
and he cannot succeed 

11:04.210 --> 11:10.980
because he comes to us to cure him,
that means he is suffering chronically

11:11.080 --> 11:19.300
 or acutely. That means that the organism is having the symptoms constantly

11:20.000 --> 11:29.860
and through these symptoms the organism
 is trying, 'let's make it a little bit more

11:29.960 --> 11:36.520
 this headache and then I will cure you'. 
The defence mechanism behind. 

11:36.620 --> 11:42.220
You see for those who suffer with 
chronic headaches, every week 

11:42.320 --> 11:46.500
there comes a headache, every 
week 3 hours come the headache,

11:46.600 --> 11:57.210
 every 3 hours come the pains in the 
abdomen, every day or every 2nd day 

11:57.310 --> 12:04.140
comes the pain in the gall bladder etc.
 That means the organism 

12:04.240 --> 12:15.980
That means the organism is bringing
 an epileptic fit every 5 days, 
every 3 days, every day.

12:16.410 --> 12:25.880
This epileptic fit we claim it is an effort
 of the organism to cure itself.

12:26.320 --> 12:32.090
This cough is an effort of the
 organism to cure itself. 

12:34.350 --> 12:45.750
Therefore if we strengthen by 
a mechanism, if we strengthen this effort, 

12:46.170 --> 12:55.560
the organism will be cured. If we find 
a way to strengthen the defences

12:55.660 --> 13:05.420
of the body, then the organism will be cured because the organism is saying that 

13:05.520 --> 13:14.650
'through these symptoms I try to cure myself 
but I cannot, I need some extra strength

13:14.750 --> 13:23.880
 to make these symptoms a little bit 
more so that I can overcome the disease'.

13:23.990 --> 13:28.310
And there we come with a remedy 
which is similar which 

13:28.410 --> 13:39.380
touches the organism on an energy 
level, as the student said,

13:39.480 --> 13:51.810
and for a period of time we have an 
aggravation, smaller or bigger aggravation.

13:52.770 --> 13:59.540
 In every case, in the homeopathic cure 
we have an aggravation of the symptoms, 

13:59.640 --> 14:04.470
what we call the aggravation of the 
symptoms. That means that the symptoms

14:04.570 --> 14:13.150
will become a little bit stronger for a small 
period, for a fraction of a minute sometimes, 

14:13.250 --> 14:21.550
in an acute disease or for several days 
in a case of chronic disease.

14:25.320 --> 14:32.160
 The patient may experience an
 aggravation of the symptoms.

14:32.580 --> 14:39.810
The symptoms become a little bit more
 or sometimes quite a lot more. 

14:40.850 --> 14:46.340
If the symptoms become quite a 
lot more then most probably 

14:48.080 --> 14:59.560
we have given the right remedy. We shall talk about the different modifications of that.

15:00.310 --> 15:11.180
But giving an extra push, brings about what 
the organism is not able to do by himself 

15:11.280 --> 15:24.000
and there is a release. Did you understand 
this? Do you comprehend this point? 

15:24.100 --> 15:29.880
This is a point where we have to discuss so everybody will understand very clearly.

15:29.980 --> 15:34.300
You have it in your mind 
established very clearly.

15:34.400 --> 15:40.660
- Dr. Vithoulkas, do you mean that if there is 
no aggravation at all there is no cure?

15:44.110 --> 15:57.490
-Good question. I mean yes, when there 
is no aggravation it cannot be a cure 

15:57.590 --> 16:00.010
with a difference.

16:00.110 --> 16:09.590
When this reaction has 
reached its highest point, 

16:09.690 --> 16:16.630
the reaction is almost
 imperceptible, is very little.

16:16.730 --> 16:27.570
The organism needs a little bit more so the patient himself does not realise the reaction.

16:27.670 --> 16:37.130
And usually this case is in severe,
 acute diseases, where the patient 

16:37.230 --> 16:42.950
hardly realises the reaction,
 a little bit more fever,  

16:43.050 --> 16:50.140
it doesn’t' matter, a little bit more 
headache, it doesn' t matter,

16:50.240 --> 16:59.140
because he is in a very bad state already. 
But when we have chronic cases 

16:59.240 --> 17:06.730
there we have to be careful because
the reaction can be quite severe.

17:07.760 --> 17:18.580
 If in chronic cases we have problems that 
are functional, functional problems only

17:18.680 --> 17:29.030
that means it is only a spasm of a 
vessel which makes the problem 

17:29.130 --> 17:34.830
with the headache and that's all. 
We have different kinds of headaches, 

17:34.930 --> 17:39.760
there are severe headaches etc. 
and in Homeopathy we learn

17:39.930 --> 17:47.300
that each organism has 
its own severity of state. 

17:47.400 --> 17:52.660
That means, headache one person,
 headache the other person.

17:52.760 --> 17:56.340
In this headache which looks 
similar to his headache, 

17:56.440 --> 18:01.330
is much more easy to cure
 than his headache.

18:01.430 --> 18:07.670
That means there is a depth on this headache and not a depth on that headache.

18:07.770 --> 18:16.040
That means that this headache will be cured without almost any perceptible aggravation.

18:16.810 --> 18:25.470
His headache which is of a deeper kind is
 going to have a tremendous aggravation.

18:26.360 --> 18:34.700
So it will depend on something which is 
called the depth of the problem, 

18:34.800 --> 18:42.200
which depends on different characters 
which we will be talking about, later on.

18:44.240 --> 18:50.120
I don't want to bring a lot of issues
together at the same time. 

18:50.220 --> 18:55.820
I want to keep it clear, basic things 
and then we'll elaborate as we go along,

18:55.920 --> 19:03.400
 we will elaborate more and more
 on these issues.

19:03.720 --> 19:11.660
But this I consider as a major 
understanding of how the remedy acts.

19:12.120 --> 19:22.370
That means that every symptom is an effort of the organism to be cured, to bring balance, 

19:22.470 --> 19:30.010
because this organism after this will 
come to a kind of a balance, like this. 

19:30.920 --> 19:38.030
That means little symptoms anymore, 
they don't bother etc. he's almost well. 

19:38.130 --> 19:41.450
Maybe at that state we can try 
and give a second remedy 

19:41.550 --> 19:47.760
or may not try even,
 to give a second remedy.

19:47.860 --> 19:53.860
So my first question to you will be:

20:14.960 --> 20:35.550
Find where, in the Organon, which 
paragraph, states the law of similars 

20:35.650 --> 20:46.810
and in which paragraph Hahnemann 
explains this law, how it works. 

20:52.820 --> 21:04.960
State whether this explanation is the same as Hahnemann's or Hahnemman is different

21:05.090 --> 21:11.150
or my explanation is different. 

21:52.340 --> 22:04.740
 State in which paragraph, the law of 
similars is mentioned in the Organon

22:04.840 --> 22:14.640
in which paragraph the explanation
 of how the remedy works, 

22:14.740 --> 22:24.360
and 3rd question, whether this explanation
is the same as the one I gave you here.

22:38.120 --> 22:51.020
The body is trying through this symptomatology,  to bring back the balance but you will say

22:51.120 --> 23:00.870
if you have an epileptic fit is it possible that through the epileptic fit the body is trying to

23:00.970 --> 23:10.040
cure itself? Have we ever seen a case of epilepsy where it has been cured 

23:10.140 --> 23:22.730
through the epileptic fit? Such questions 
I would expect from you. Do you understand?

23:23.710 --> 23:28.880
 I want you to put forward your 
questions or whatever you feel,

23:29.400 --> 23:38.120
 well I don't understand, and we discuss
 until everything is clear in you.

23:38.220 --> 23:49.080
Symptoms are developing in order to 
prevent a more severe or fatal outcome 

23:49.180 --> 23:55.700
from the disease. So an epileptic fit 
actually in the body which

23:55.800 --> 24:04.850
   points out to a heavy electric discharge, 

24:04.950 --> 24:14.580
it could have killed that organism if the 
organism did not have the defence 

24:14.680 --> 24:21.970
mechanism ready to produce that kind
 of unconsiousness and spasm etc.

24:23.400 --> 24:32.070
So yes definitely, this is to balance the 
body so it can exist, it can survive, 

24:32.170 --> 24:34.880
otherwise it can die. 

24:36.200 --> 24:42.910
But the fact remains, if we are 
interested, that this points to us, 

24:43.010 --> 24:50.060
how we shall go about finding the 
remedy, by taking into consideration

24:50.160 --> 24:54.890
all these symptoms of the patient.

24:56.040 --> 25:01.170
- I just wanted to say that several copying strategies for people who have chronic pain

25:01.270 --> 25:05.520
and one of them is to increase the pain,
to go into the pain mentally and so 

25:05.620 --> 25:09.620

they can cope with the pain, they can 
reduce the pain by increasing it.

25:09.720 --> 25:12.370
So this is similar to what
we are talking about.

25:12.470 --> 25:23.630
-Yes. There are strategies, as you say, 
that the people who are really suffering 

25:23.730 --> 25:29.030
are trying to go into the pain and 
increase the pain so it can relieve 

25:29.130 --> 25:39.290
but always in a kind of temporary 
decrease, not real cure.

25:41.060 --> 25:43.940
There are strategies in psychotherapy
 which are the same, 

25:44.040 --> 25:50.260
for instance somebody is fearing 
microbes, he is fearing the microbes.

25:50.360 --> 25:53.590
In everything he touches, 
he feels there are microbes. 

25:53.690 --> 25:58.600
So there is a strategy in psychotherapy
where they take him in a bathroom

25:58.700 --> 26:06.110
where the bathroom is full of dirt 
and say now wash your hands

26:06.210 --> 26:14.150
into this basin and see how you feel. 
I mean, you understand that the increase 

26:14.250 --> 26:28.540
of the fear will be so great and then
this symptom which is fear of microbes, 

26:28.640 --> 26:32.310
it goes very high.

26:32.410 --> 26:45.850
And they have observed that through 
such thing we can have a cure of what ? 

26:45.950 --> 26:48.580
Of the symptom. And this is the difference between Homeopathy and Psychotherapy.

26:52.950 --> 27:01.460
 Here they cure that symptom which was
over ruling the body, fear of microbes,

27:01.970 --> 27:05.460
 tremendous fear of 
microbes and all his life is..

27:05.560 --> 27:09.450
and then they put him 
there and then it increases 

27:09.550 --> 27:14.420
and they find out that 
this symptom goes away.

27:14.520 --> 27:26.080
But many times they find that the organism replaces this symptom with another one.

27:27.890 --> 27:40.400
So therefore, the patient remains as a mental case but with a different symptomatology.

27:41.680 --> 27:46.950
- Mr Vithoulkas, I would like to ask, in §2 Hahnemann uses the word gentle, 

27:47.050 --> 27:51.940
are you saying that the severe 
aggravation can we call that gentle?

27:52.040 --> 28:02.720
-Very gentle. We call it gentle in 
comparison with suffering.

28:02.820 --> 28:12.270
If the suffering is really severe and 
for years, the aggravation of the few days 

28:12.370 --> 28:20.190
is nothing for the patient, who is suffering
 for the last 10-15 years and after that

28:20.290 --> 28:34.720
to be cured. A second question, and 
be careful these are questions that

28:34.820 --> 28:46.110
contain a catch inside, be careful. 
Find in which paragraphs Hahnemann 

28:46.210 --> 28:52.760
talks about the aggravation. 

29:04.750 --> 29:11.990
And state whether this 
explanation in the Organon

29:12.090 --> 29:19.160
 is the same as the explanation 
we are giving here.

29:27.400 --> 29:39.060
So you will write, Hahnemann talks for aggravation on paragraph 78,103 and 104.

29:39.160 --> 29:45.410
The explanation is different or 
it's the same. That's all I want.

29:51.510 --> 29:56.910
- We know that with some patients we have symptoms that depend on the presence 

29:57.010 --> 30:04.810
or the absence of some elements in the
 body, like for example we might have goitre

30:04.910 --> 30:14.640
 because we lack iodine in the water. How 
are we going to differentiate such symptoms

30:15.250 --> 30:19.120
from the symptoms that really have
 a sense in Homeopathy? 

30:19.220 --> 30:26.950
Let's say for example, if someone 
has lack of sugar in the blood 

30:27.050 --> 30:33.300
a very simple method to correct
 this is if we give him sugar 

30:33.400 --> 30:36.820
and not if we give him a homeopathic remedy.

30:39.490 --> 30:57.240
- Yes, that is correct. This is how most of us exist by doing certain supplement things in our life,

30:57.980 --> 31:05.140
correcting the diet, doing a little more diet 
of this type than this type etc, etc. 

31:05.240 --> 31:19.580
and these are measures on a level 
which is quite superficial in order not

31:19.680 --> 31:32.170
to suffer so much chronically. 
The correct homeopathic remedy finally

31:32.270 --> 31:41.450
corrects the organism so it can receive the elements, the micro elements that needs, 

31:41.550 --> 31:49.760
the vitamins, the minerals etc.,
 it can receive them from the food easily.

31:49.880 --> 31:55.120
Our organisms today, most of our organisms,
 are not in a position to do that. 

31:55.220 --> 32:04.470
They are degenerated to a greater or 
a lesser degree and they cannot do that.

32:04.570 --> 32:15.710
So some supplements sometimes are 
necessary to feel better, what we call better. 

32:15.810 --> 32:22.210
So if I take a particular mineral
 I feel better, that is true.

32:23.100 --> 32:31.540
The homeopathic remedy will correct 
this, imbalance and this is the idea. 

32:31.640 --> 32:38.880
So the organism will feel best with 
only natural food finally.

32:38.980 --> 32:45.960
But many times we cannot attend 
this and therefore we resort 

32:46.060 --> 32:54.040
to different other measures to 
support the organism.

33:02.560 --> 33:10.320
Let me complete this. What I want to say
 now is, do you understand this? 

33:10.420 --> 33:23.550
Everybody understands this? Ok, now 
we come to the question whether all reactions

33:23.650 --> 33:32.100
 from homeopathic remedies, that means all aggravations, are curative reactions?

33:34.120 --> 33:48.840
So we know that we have a reaction
 from just proving a remedy. 

33:55.050 --> 34:08.600
We have a reaction which is curative, 
we have a reaction that can come from-

34:14.530 --> 34:39.160
we said this we call the - similimum the best remedy, the correct remedy is called the similimum.

34:41.120 --> 34:50.300
But things are so close to each other, 
that many times we choose a remedy

34:50.400 --> 35:00.800
which is similar, it's only similar.

35:07.990 --> 35:22.160
What do we mean by similar? We go back to 
this and we see that the remedy we choose,

35:22.260 --> 35:28.810
did not have the modality of this fever,
 it has another modality. 

35:33.570 --> 35:45.700
And it had the headache and it had the 
microbe but this, the thirst was not there.

35:45.800 --> 35:55.010
Actually, it wants negative here. So this 
graph is similar because it contains

35:55.110 --> 36:06.580
 that similar, that similar, that similar but 
we do not know anything better

36:06.680 --> 36:16.010
and we give this remedy. Then we give 
what we call a similar remedy, 

36:16.110 --> 36:18.250
we have a different reaction.

36:18.350 --> 36:24.370
We shall be examining now the reactions 
of the organism in each particular case 

36:24.470 --> 36:32.920
and make it very clear in our 
understanding what exactly we mean.

36:33.880 --> 36:42.220
So this 4th point it can be what? 
You have an aggravation, 

36:42.320 --> 36:48.850
the patient comes and says 
'oh, I was much worse'.

36:49.600 --> 37:06.480
Because the patient is a hysterical
 patient. He does autosuggestion; 

37:06.580 --> 37:11.980
he likes to have an aggravation because
 he has heard that it is good to have

37:12.080 --> 37:22.520
an aggravation. In this category there is
 another case, hypochondriac.

37:25.930 --> 37:32.620
The hypochondriac patients who 
are both these categories, 

37:32.720 --> 37:41.450
they will produce symptoms of their own,
that have nothing to do with your remedy,

37:41.550 --> 37:49.620
 they will tell you here, 'oh I have such a big reaction' and it is good that I had this reaction

37:49.720 --> 37:55.780
and this hypochondriac person will tell you,
 'I had this reaction and I had that reaction, 

37:55.880 --> 38:01.540
what's happening to me, am I going
 to die now? I have a little bit of 

38:01.640 --> 38:20.640
this buzzing inside my head and this 
buzzing or a little bit of dizziness'. 

38:20.740 --> 38:26.350
It becomes almost a matter 
of life and death for the patient.

38:27.710 --> 38:34.500
And then you feel that your 
remedy is not reacting at all. 

38:34.600 --> 38:40.530
You have to be able to perceive
 these things. 

38:41.000 --> 38:52.660
And then of course, we have a reaction
 from an organism when and if 

38:52.760 --> 39:00.020
we start the treatment while the 
patient is on allopathic drugs

39:00.120 --> 39:10.440
and we tell him stop these drugs and 
take this remedy. Withdrawal of drugs.

39:14.620 --> 39:21.440
Withdrawal of drugs can produce a lot
 of symptoms that do not belong 

39:21.540 --> 39:27.000
to any curative reaction.

39:28.100 --> 39:37.620
So these are the categories which 
you have to be thinking about.

39:37.920 --> 39:41.080
 The patient 
comes and gives a reaction.

39:41.180 --> 39:47.910
You have to evaluate: is it proving, is it similar,
 is it hysterical, is it hypochondriac?

39:48.010 --> 39:52.630
 Immediately you have to know. 
If you are clear in this, 

39:52.730 --> 39:58.000
then you can continue. 
If you are not clear forget it.

39:58.080 --> 40:02.270
The patient will tell you this 
time one group of symptoms, 

40:02.370 --> 40:08.310
another time that group of symptoms
and you will continue throwing remedies

40:08.410 --> 40:12.520
 without knowing exactly what 
is going on with the patient.

40:19.880 --> 40:28.190
So we go to the first category
 and we say provings. 

40:28.290 --> 40:32.450
When do we have a proving 
and not a cure?

40:32.980 --> 40:38.960
What will be the difference?
 In provings you will develop 

40:39.060 --> 40:48.950
symptoms that you did not have before.
But I will tell you something. 

40:49.050 --> 40:55.000
In a curative action, you may develop new symptoms that you did not have before also.

40:58.400 --> 41:02.220
How do you differentiate between 
one time which is not curative 

41:02.320 --> 41:07.070
and another time 
which is curative?

41:10.280 --> 41:26.110
In the provings there is no amelioration. 
You have new symptoms 

41:27.720 --> 41:35.620
which have nothing to do with 
the symptoms of the patient and 

41:35.720 --> 41:41.510
at the same time the patient says 
'on my other symptoms I am the same'. 

41:41.610 --> 41:49.820
There is no general 
amelioration of the case. 

41:55.080 --> 41:59.450
So in the provings what he will
 tell you exactly?  

41:59.550 --> 42:17.650
Υou gave a dose of Nat-m 10 M.
You gave a dose of high potency, 

42:17.750 --> 42:22.720
what we call a high potency and the 
patient comes and tells you,

42:24.240 --> 42:31.260
'It's strange that I did not suffer any 
headaches and now when I wake up

42:31.360 --> 42:41.920
in the morning I have some headache'.
What do you have to ask immediately after that?

42:43.900 --> 42:48.020
He says 'I did not 
have the headaches before'. 

42:48.120 --> 42:53.790
 Your first question immediately to 
short out, there is a typical question 

42:53.890 --> 43:01.320
 that you have immediately to ask: 
how do you feel in general now?

43:01.420 --> 43:10.490
He came for his phobias, for his fears, for 
his colitis, for his duodenal ulcer, whatever. 

43:10.590 --> 43:16.640
How is your duodenal ulcer and pains? 
'Oh, there are much better.' 

43:16.740 --> 43:23.230
 But what about the headaches? 
If the headaches are typical 

43:23.330 --> 43:28.100
headaches of Nat-m which has 
headaches on waking in the morning

43:28.200 --> 43:35.140
 or at 10 o'clock especially, this is typical, 
he says every day at 10 o'clock starts 

43:35.240 --> 43:43.410
 a headache and he says my duodenal 
ulcer is better. These two information 

43:43.510 --> 43:51.150
make absolutely sure that your remedy
 is correct. But if he says that

43:51.250 --> 43:58.300
 'I have the headaches but my duodenal 
ulcer is the same or my other symptoms

43:58.400 --> 44:03.290
 are the same, no change' 
this is a case of a proving. 

44:03.390 --> 44:13.160
 That means you gave a remedy 
which had an effect and he is a prover.

44:14.780 --> 44:19.700
So in a prover you don't have an 
amelioration on the energy level, 

44:19.800 --> 44:25.140
you don't have an amelioration 
on local symptomatology

44:25.240 --> 44:31.550
and you have the appearance of new 
symptoms that he did not have before.

44:35.730 --> 44:43.980
These things you have to know very 
clearly and immediately. 

44:44.080 --> 44:50.970
Otherwise my experience is that cases 
 have been spoiled mostly because of

44:51.070 --> 45:03.580
 lack of this knowledge. 'Oh, it is a proving
 I must antidote' or different ideas

45:04.920 --> 45:15.660
but if the person is better generally, better
 in his ulcer, leave alone the headache 

45:15.760 --> 45:21.520
 of the Nat-m because it's going 
to go away very soon,

45:23.030 --> 45:31.780
by itself without any further remedy. 
If you enter with another remedy 

45:31.880 --> 45:37.880
you are going to spoil your good 
action of your remedy.

45:43.060 --> 45:50.340
And of course when you're dealing 
with deep severe chronic cases, 

45:50.440 --> 45:56.100
 things are not very clear.
But the general rules should be there,

45:56.200 --> 46:04.250
 the general rules should 
be understood by you.

46:05.500 --> 46:21.950
The first thing you'll see is a feeling of 
being better, I feel better, general. 

46:28.010 --> 46:36.680
I have more headaches, I have more 
pains etc. but I feel better generally

46:36.780 --> 46:55.360
it is and indication that your remedy
 is correct. Then, psychologically better,

46:58.050 --> 47:14.300
that means in mental - emotional better
then most probably your remedy is correct.

47:26.320 --> 47:54.060
Better in symptoms, better in the symptoms
 and either no change psychologically 

47:54.160 --> 48:00.970
 or no change in general that means 
general the same, psychologically

48:01.070 --> 48:11.160
 the same.....you see you have
 to be very precise.

48:12.120 --> 48:19.230
Here, somebody tells you 'my stomach 
pains, my headaches, 

48:19.330 --> 48:27.700
my physical symptoms are better but 
 I have no change psychologically

48:27.800 --> 48:36.370
 and I have no change in general', is it better, 
is it curative action or is it not?

48:42.820 --> 48:49.200
You see, immediately you have doubts. 
Here we do not have doubts, 

48:49.300 --> 48:52.740
we have to be very clear, ok?

48:54.960 --> 49:04.880
If these symptoms are better and
 it is curative that means, 

49:04.980 --> 49:12.030
that the general state and the 
psychological state are quite well,

49:12.130 --> 49:17.640
quite balanced, did not need 
a rearrangement. All the force 

49:17.740 --> 49:25.720
of the disease was in physical level.
That physical level gets better

49:25.820 --> 49:31.650
 and then that's all that the 
remedy should do.

49:32.310 --> 49:37.800
If you expect every time to say the
 patient is better psychologically

49:37.900 --> 49:49.210
 and better generally, it is wrong, 
as long as these states,

49:49.310 --> 49:55.840
 general states, psychological states 
are in a good condition.

49:55.842 --> 50:11.930
If the symptoms are better but worse 
here or worse there, that is another story. 

50:22.610 --> 50:36.420
In curative action here, you 
may have a proving symptom. 

50:37.870 --> 50:47.770
That means, better generally, better in the symptoms but one or two proving 

50:49.240 --> 51:00.570
 symptoms are appearing that shows 
that the remedy is absolutely correct.

51:00.670 --> 51:07.980
It is a confirmation that your remedy 
is correct if you have the proving

51:08.080 --> 51:14.840
 of one or two symptoms of the remedy.

51:15.560 --> 51:20.220
While the person is getting better 
psychologically or better generally 

51:20.320 --> 51:23.070
or better in the symptoms.

51:32.500 --> 51:39.680
So therefore you say, you give a remedy
 'ah I have a symptom, it's a proving'.

51:39.780 --> 51:44.800
No, no, no wait a moment.
'How do you feel psychologically?', 'Better'.

51:44.900 --> 51:47.830
 Generally, better and 
you have a proving?

51:47.930 --> 52:00.430
That is a confirmation that the remedy 
was correct, it's not a proving.

52:02.920 --> 52:18.710
Now you come here in this group where 
we have most of the problems, why?

52:19.350 --> 52:33.180
Because the remedy we many times give, especially when we prescribe fast, 

52:33.280 --> 52:41.470
when we give a similar 
remedy which what it does?

52:46.440 --> 53:02.660
Here, in this group we have 
1) change of symptoms,

53:05.640 --> 53:12.720
 2) no general amelioration, 

53:14.650 --> 53:23.240
3) no mental amelioration. 

53:38.690 --> 53:46.350
When I say change of symptoms what 
do I mean? I mean that a headache 

53:46.450 --> 53:54.500
has been changing to vertigo. You gave 
a remedy because of chronic headaches 

53:54.600 --> 54:03.580
 and the headaches have been changed 
to vertigo. The person says I feel dizzy.

54:04.350 --> 54:10.180
Yes you feel dizzy but are you better 
generally? He says no.  

54:10.280 --> 54:18.060
Are you better psychologically? No.
That means you gave a similar remedy

54:18.160 --> 54:21.680
 and you are going to change 
symptom after symptom.

54:21.780 --> 54:31.690
Now, how you handle that we'll talk. 
In hysterical and hypochondriac patients 

54:31.790 --> 54:37.660
you have a reaction almost with every 
remedy you give. You don't know if the 

54:37.760 --> 54:46.190
reaction is because of the remedy or 
because of the make up of the person.

54:46.680 --> 54:54.510
In these cases, hysterical, you see that not always the symptoms belong to the remedy.

54:54.610 --> 55:02.760
These hysterical people can bring out a lot of other symptoms that do not belong to the remedy.

55:09.210 --> 55:16.700
And many times in group 6
 because you decided to give a remedy 

55:16.800 --> 55:22.570
under allopathic drugs you don't know
what are the symptoms underneath. 

55:22.670 --> 55:28.700
So you withdraw the drugs and all 
other symptoms start appearing.

55:29.280 --> 55:34.410
You don't know whether they belong to
 the remedy or not to the remedy etc.

55:34.510 --> 55:40.760
  and that is why the best thing 
to handle these cases is to stop 

55:40.860 --> 55:50.020
the allopathic drugs at least for one month, 
see the picture and start from that picture.

55:50.120 --> 55:57.300
If you start while the person is under 
allopathic drugs, then you will have  

55:57.400 --> 56:04.920
a problem in evaluating what is 
happening under your remedy.

56:08.510 --> 56:25.900
So handling of provings. How you 
handle a proving? What do you do?

56:28.820 --> 56:33.500
A proving is when you have new 
symptoms, belonging to the remedy. 

56:33.600 --> 56:37.680
Characteristic symptoms of the remedy
without any change of the condition

56:39.680 --> 56:47.150
 of the person. That's a proving. 
What do you do?

56:50.750 --> 57:00.470
Here you have to wait and the symptoms 
of the remedy will subside within 

57:00.570 --> 57:09.320
a period of time which is between 
a few days to a few weeks, 5, 6 weeks.

57:12.660 --> 57:21.500
If you wait the symptoms will subside but 
that means that the remedy you have given

57:21.600 --> 57:27.770
is wrong and you have to search
 for another remedy.

57:27.870 --> 57:35.030
In such a case you can prescribe
 the next remedy even when

57:35.130 --> 57:41.470
  the symptoms 
of the provings are still there.

57:41.570 --> 57:45.290
The organism does not care.
 If you give the next remedy

57:45.390 --> 57:50.040
which is the correct one, will react.

57:51.680 --> 57:59.460
So here, for the provings the best is to wait 
until the symptoms of the provings go away.

57:59.560 --> 58:05.980
If the person is suffering a lot you cannot 
wait. Then you can still go ahead 

58:06.080 --> 58:10.500
and give the next remedy.

58:10.600 --> 58:20.940
Will you take in consideration the 
symptoms of the proving together 

58:21.040 --> 58:27.440
with his other symptoms? 
No, in this case, no.  

58:32.040 --> 58:38.430
You go back to the original case and 
you study the original case only, 

58:38.530 --> 58:40.780
not the proving symptoms. 

58:40.880 --> 58:52.700
If you put together the proving 
symptoms then you make a confusion.

58:52.800 --> 58:58.020
- Can I make a contradiction and go to the 
first remedy and then to the next, 

58:58.120 --> 59:02.220
right remedy, is it possible?

59:02.320 --> 59:09.660
-To make a contradiction? Counteraction, antidote, you mean antidote?

59:11.800 --> 59:17.530

No. It's not necessary 
to give an antidote.

59:20.770 --> 59:30.520
The best is going back to the case, 
restudy and give the next, best remedy.

59:35.510 --> 59:44.580
On the curative reaction, especially 
when he says better generally 

59:44.680 --> 59:54.940
 but the symptoms still are 
there, what you do?

59:55.039 --> 59:57.750
-Wait.

00:59:57.850 --> 01:00:09.140
-Wait, better psychologically the physical symptoms are still there, wait.  

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:18.240
Don't interfere with another remedy.
 Please don't spoil a good prescription. 

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:26.940
You will see eventually that these 
symptoms also subside, 

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:33.440
maybe they need time 
3 weeks, 3 or 5 months.

01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:40.660
If you leave alone the organism, 
the symptoms will subside.

01:00:45.590 --> 01:00:54.980
If you have a proving here, will you do
 anything? No, leave it alone. 

01:00:55.080 --> 01:01:04.140
 Once you make sure that the person is 
better generally, better psychologically and

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:11.920
   some provings are there, leave it alone, the proving symptoms will subside by themselves.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.480
- How long can we wait?

01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:36.540
- Three years. Bill Gray, you know 
Bill Gray? Everyone knows him. 

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:41.080
He came here to study with me for 
2 years. He stayed in Greece.

01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:46.380
One year he went back for one 
month to see his cases  

01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:51.750
and then he came
 back again for the second year.

01:01:51.850 --> 01:01:57.260
In the meantime he was treating some 
of the cases through correspondence 

01:01:57.360 --> 01:01:59.820
and all the cases that 
 he treated a year ago, 

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:06.660
when he came back to me he said,
 'I cannot believe it, all my cases

01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:15.750
are doing well. Why? Because I did not
 interfere, I was not there to interfere 

01:02:15.850 --> 01:02:23.000
with the remedy all the time. What I was
 doing stupidly all the time before. 

01:02:23.770 --> 01:02:33.580
 I left them alone, he says I want to see you, much better, diabetes, chronic diseases, everyone'.

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:41.270
He has given the right remedy many times 
and he was doing this kind of things, 

01:02:41.370 --> 01:02:46.349
oh now I have this pain, take this remedy.
Now I have that, take this, take that

01:02:46.449 --> 01:02:53.340
 and you spoil the case. You leave it 
alone and you see.

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:58.330
I mean there is placebo, you can 
give placebo if you want, 

01:02:58.430 --> 01:03:06.230
if the patient needs to take 
something, you give placebo.

01:03:06.330 --> 01:03:14.060
But it is very important to know the rules
 here. If you don't know the rules, 

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:18.150
the proving, 
the similar, the withdrawal,

01:03:18.250 --> 01:03:27.450
if you are not clear in that how can
 you proceed? You have to be clear.

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:37.420
The remedy is correct you leave it alone. 
How long you leave it alone? 

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:42.740
I would say if the person feels better 
generally, better psychologically

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:53.760
, 6 or 9 months, wait.
 As long as it is a real information,

01:03:53.860 --> 01:04:03.890
 not the idea of, 'are you better 
psychologically'? The patient thinks, 

01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:10.200
'you are better, you are better, 
oh you are better'.

01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:23.580
Not like this, this is dangerous. You are
 better,  I can see you are better. 

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:27.870
Many times 
I can see if somebody is better.

01:04:27.970 --> 01:04:34.180
They enter the room and there is another
 air, you feel immediately the remedy.

01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:40.180
He says, how are you and you have 
a problem there with the patient 

01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:49.070
who wants everything to go in one month. 
Then you have to pass judgement quickly.

01:04:49.170 --> 01:04:57.060
 I see he's better, how much he accepts, 
what type of the person he is etc.

01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:04.680
This is what we have to learn through 
taking the case and evaluating. 

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:15.500
Because human beings are not simple 
beings, they are complicated. 

01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:22.270
They have a lot of back thinking, think in 
one level and there is another level 

01:05:22.370 --> 01:05:24.510
where he thinks something else.

01:05:24.610 --> 01:05:29.600
And perhaps some of them are thinking
 on 3 levels at the same time.

01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:38.270
One level tells you one thing, the second level says let's see how he reacts if I tell this thing

01:05:38.370 --> 01:05:45.270
 and the third level is criticising you 
and says this, this and that.

01:05:45.370 --> 01:05:52.340
All these are happening together. 
It's not so easy, we say better 

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:57.020
psychologically and generally better, yes.

01:05:57.120 --> 01:06:08.370
These reactions you get from people
 living in the country, villagers, farmers, 

01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:16.280
people who work with their bodies 
a lot, have simple reactions.

01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:26.700
The more educated is a person, the more complicated he is in his reactions and

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:37.310
 transactions and you have to be very 
aware of how he gives you an information, 

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:45.340
what he says, who he is. A simple
 person, you say to him you are better,

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:49.560
 you are better, he will say 
yes I am better finally.

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:58.760
An intellectual he will not accept this
 treatment, he will judge you,

01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:03.390
 he will leave you, he will say 'oh, you’re
 stupid you are this or you are that'

01:07:03.490 --> 01:07:10.260
 and he will go to somebody else. 
But an intellectual can be better

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:16.660
and not tell you I am better because 
he's judging you all the time. 

01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:22.870
He gives you one thing and he's 
judging you on another level.

01:07:22.970 --> 01:07:27.690
Does he understand, how much he 
understands etc. and you have to be 

01:07:27.790 --> 01:07:33.010
aware of what you have in front of you.

01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:46.980
The evaluation of the reaction to homeopathic remedy is an art really of high order.

01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:57.720
Because you are judged by the gods how 
much really you understand human nature, 

01:07:57.820 --> 01:08:00.970
do you understand human nature?


01:08:01.070 --> 01:08:08.220
You say yes, I understand but who 
understands human nature, nobody totally.

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:14.980
 But as the experience comes, you see more 
and more cases, you are able to perceive

01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:20.740
more and more what is happening in the 
soul of a person, in the mind of a person

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:31.280
who comes to you to be treated. Because 
your desire is to cure him, you don't care 

01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:34.480
about judgement and things like that,
 he judges me or he doesn't judge me. 

01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:42.800

What you are concentrated
 upon is his health.

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:53.940
So you have to be an objective observer,
 not conditioned, not prejudiced.  

01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:57.780
Because if you are prejudiced when 
he comes there  and he judges you

01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:10.240
 and you understand, you judge him back 
and you say he's pissed, he's this, that.

01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:20.260
Forget about the cure, your ego comes 
into the picture and then 

01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:26.540
some other person comes and you say
 how nice, only good reactions

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:32.530
and you will have only your friends and 
people who like you as patients. 

01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:36.040
All the others will leave you. 

01:09:40.630 --> 01:09:52.460
When you give a similar remedy you have
the most unfortunate thing happening, 

01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:58.659
 changing the symptoms of the case 
without curing the patient.

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:03.500
 And this is the most unfortunate
 that can happen. 

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:08.160
Unfortunately
 it happens frequently.

01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:20.170
You give a remedy and then the patient 
comes and tells you 'my stomachache is better'

01:10:20.270 --> 01:10:24.410
 but he comes after 3 months,
 because he follows you.

01:10:24.510 --> 01:10:31.000
These cases will follow you 
for 3 years, 5, 10 years. 

01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:35.421
They are patients who will follow 
you the rest of your life.

01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:47.940
Because they have found out that 
something you can do but not the best 

01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:55.130
and they follow you, they are good 
patients, they support us financially

01:10:55.230 --> 01:11:00.420
 because if you cure everybody one time, 
the whole planet in 1 year is finished.

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:17.020
No patients, I'm just joking. These patients
 here you have to know yourself, 

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:21.670
 you don't tell them.  Or you can
 tell them if you think they are

01:11:21.770 --> 01:11:27.540
 intelligent enough to understand, you say 
I made a mistake and I just changed

01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:36.850
your symptoms without curing you. 
And I have to search for another remedy.

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:43.220
Now here the situation is very difficult. 
We'll talk a lot about the second prescription

01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:50.620
 in such cases, in detail, how to handle
 this because it's a very very serious

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:57.250
  condition and it
 goes into a lot of details.

01:11:58.910 --> 01:12:04.230
In this case you'll find that certain of the symptoms of the initial symptoms 

01:12:04.330 --> 01:12:11.700
 are going away or are going away on a big degree like 80% gone but some other

01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:19.250
symptoms are developing of the
 same order, of the same level.

01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:30.640
Sometimes by giving these remedies a lot, you may change level and go in a deeper level.

01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:41.620
Now, hysterical or hypochondriac patients 
are those who will tell you with every 

01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:48.860
remedy you give, that they have different symptoms that you cannot find in the provings. 

01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:56.920
They are symptoms of their own. 
Which do not present symptoms

01:12:57.020 --> 01:13:06.570
 of a remedy. You gave Sepia and 
you have developing some phobias

01:13:06.670 --> 01:13:14.090
fear of the dark, fear of this or that, 
symptoms that do not belong to Sepia.

01:13:14.330 --> 01:13:22.700
You search for Sepia and you don't see 
clear symptoms of Sepia but the patient

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:25.700
 is presenting a lot. Then you give 
another remedy then they present

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:31.900
other symptoms etc, etc. All the time, 
every time you give a remedy 

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:43.180
 there is a new set of symptoms. It's better
 to wait with this patient to settle down 

01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:51.220
and give very low potencies before you 
can make head or tail in this case, 

01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:54.300
before the case is clear.

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:13.620
- But the word hypochondriac means that 
it comes from a very deep place, 

01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:17.800
so it means that it's coming 
from a very genuine source.

01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:23.570
 So you may have to do something about 
it even if it's called hypochondriac.

01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:32.180
- Oh yes, absolutely. I don't say you leave 
them alone, you don't treat them. 

01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:38.040
 I say better be careful not to give,
 with every symptom that they give you,

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:46.900
 another remedy. You can wait for such 
people for months to collect all 

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:53.580
the symptomatology they present 
 and make an evaluation of the whole

01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:57.430
 of the symptomatology and 
see the general picture.

01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:12.030
Then you see the hypochondriasis 
and what is hypochondriasis? 

01:15:12.130 --> 01:15:21.010
Usually it's about the health of the 
person  and every symptom is exaggerated

01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:30.740
 and every time, I mean whatever, 
some people look their (pulse) and say

01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:39.720
'I cannot find this' or they pick 
up the telephone and tell you 

01:15:39.730 --> 01:15:56.150
 'I think I have 78 pulse'. You say, 'don't worry
 it's ok, it's normal'. They say 'normal, 78?'. 

01:15:56.250 --> 01:16:11.460
'Yes it's normal', you have to be certain.
'78 pulses are normal', they say 'oh 68', 

01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:22.020
 '68 it's also normal. The normal pulse
 is from 68 to 78', you have to be sure.

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:28.210
Then you wait, what you're doing behind 
your mind you are searching if this is 

01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:40.220
a case of Nit-ac. or Lyc. or Nat-m 
or Kali-ars. The remedies with such kind

01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:52.480
 of an anxiety which all the time say
 'oh, I have a little pain I think'.

01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:09.170
'Do you feel pain?', 'I think, I think'. 
You do not go and say pain in the right 

01:17:09.270 --> 01:17:19.580
hypochondrium and give Chelidonium, no.
You take the whole situation of the patient, 

01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:25.380
 it's different all together. The one who
 has pain in the right hypochondrium

01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:45.420
he says, you read his mind at this 
moment, he says: 'shall I tell him or not.

01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:50.900
If I tell him that I feel a pain maybe he 
will say it is cancer but if I don't tell him  

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:56.540
that I feel a pain that means that he will 
forget about me. So what shall I tell?'

01:17:56.640 --> 01:18:03.500
 That kind of thinking is going on
on a hypochondriasis state. 

01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:09.380
 Then you don't take this pain and that pain 
and that pain, you take the whole picture 

01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:12.701
which says wait a moment. 
With the blood pressure,

01:18:12.801 --> 01:18:19.080
 hypochondriacs who have blood
 pressure, forget it.

01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:23.920
Because the blood pressure normally goes 
up and down all the time, in the morning, 

01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:32.640
in the evening etc. and then when 
they learn to put this 'I have 148'

01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:44.080
Yes but then you are 58 and 148 
is normal. They say 'it's normal?'. 

01:18:45.310 --> 01:18:52.660
So when you come to these cases you 
have a lot of problems, stop giving remedies.

01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:58.100
 You gave 1 remedy, you gave 2 remedies,
 every time it was a big reaction

01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:08.190
you didn't know where you are. 
Wait a moment, wait and observe now. 

01:19:08.290 --> 01:19:10.880
Eventually the picture will develop. 

01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:19.130
Is this Agar., is Nat-m., is Lyc., because 
you think on another level in the case.

01:19:19.530 --> 01:19:28.780
They guide you to look upon little symptoms
 here and there when the main symptoms

01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:36.840
are on mental level and then 
you have a problem.

01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:42.360
 Because you are describing these 
little symptoms all around and

01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:46.860
you forget about the mental level. 

01:19:49.100 --> 01:19:58.830
What do I do when I give a remedy 
and the patient has severe aggravation, 
which he cannot tolerate?

01:19:58.930 --> 01:20:12.420
We shall be talking about these cases and 
if this case is very close to be incurable, 

01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:16.780
most probably you will have to interfere
 with another remedy 

01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:19.646
in order to upgrade this patient.

01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:26.410
Otherwise if you let him
 go like that, he will die.

01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:31.620
So in an aggravation, real aggravation 
from the homeopathic remedy,

01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:41.390
 in the so called incurable case, it needs 
an interference with the next remedy.

01:20:41.490 --> 01:20:46.590
 And usually the next remedy 
appears, you can see.

01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:03.750
- With the hysterical, hypochondriac 
cases isn't a symptom on itself 

01:21:03.850 --> 01:21:05.700
when you look out  at the rubric?

01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:18.150
- Absolutely, you take in consideration 
the anxiety hypochondriac as a rubric 

01:21:18.250 --> 01:21:22.780
but this is not enough because 
there you have 50 remedies.

01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:38.970
Which of the remedies.... a lot of remedies
 which you have to differentiate. 

01:21:47.390 --> 01:21:56.380
Is it good to give placebo to such cases? 
 Absolutely you give placebo 3 times the day,

01:21:56.480 --> 01:22:06.700
 you start with 1 time, you say double it, 
3ple it, 10 times whatever satisfies their need

01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:22.210
and because these patients are usually 
led by their minds and hypochondriasis, 

01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:30.640
to keep them in a low level  it is very 
good for them and will make them

01:22:30.740 --> 01:22:37.699
 survive enough time for you to observe 
what other symptoms are there

01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:45.920
so you make your correct decision. But have
in mind with these cases especially, 

01:22:46.020 --> 01:22:53.340
that it is an element which will always 
be there to a certain degree.  

01:22:54.510 --> 01:23:06.910
It's like personality traits.
 So it will stay, but the exaggeration, 

01:23:07.010 --> 01:23:11.780
the fears, the anxieties, the panic attack 
which goes with such cases,

01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:22.220
 all this will go away. And in the back of their mind it will remain,  what about this pain?

01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:31.230
But then just a thought and then it goes 
away. Otherwise, the thought stays and 

01:23:31.330 --> 01:23:41.160
tantalize them and makes them really 
fearful, I'm going to die.

01:24:06.870 --> 01:24:18.520
Find in the Organon where Hahnemann talks about hysterical and hypochondriac patients.

01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:09.270
Where Hahnemann talks about this group,
 the similar, in the Organon?

01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:27.360
And which are the paragraphs in 
which he talks about provings?
