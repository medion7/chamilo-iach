1
00:00:18,823 --> 00:00:27,156
-I have a patient that I'm treating constitutionally and one day a severe shock happened to her.

2
00:00:29,542 --> 00:00:37,354
Her little baby was run over by a car and after that she developed severe fears.

3
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:43,354
She remembered that as a child she was attacked by a bird and this bird

4
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:48,031
actually picked on her face
 and destroyed her face.

5
00:00:48,135 --> 00:00:53,729
And according to this event of shock,
 I gave her Aconite.

6
00:00:53,833 --> 00:01:00,604
All her life long she was not able to move,
she always has a stiff neck

7
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:05,094
and after giving her Aconite, she
could move her head again.

8
00:01:05,135 --> 00:01:11,438
My question is: is this person
strong person constitutionally?

9
00:01:11,542 --> 00:01:19,875
Because her fears materialized to her
body by the stiffness of the neck?

10
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:32,719
-There are several things there. The first
 is that this woman had a shock

11
00:01:32,823 --> 00:01:39,042
when she was a young girl and has a
shock when she is a grown up woman.

12
00:01:41,156 --> 00:01:55,896
Due to initial shock, the fears
somatised in the stiffness,

13
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:04,813
she became stiff from fear,
we say it. She could not move.

14
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:18,781
And the stiffness was somatised on the neck. Now she gets another shock and the baby

15
00:02:18,885 --> 00:02:24,958
is run over and then the fears develop.

16
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,813
She comes with a stiff neck from initial fear,
 with new fears which come from the baby.

17
00:02:33,917 --> 00:02:41,688
He gives Aconite and actually what it does,
 it takes off the first layer of this woman.

18
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:46,521
The first layer of that
woman now it's taken away.

19
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:51,250
After Aconite, most probably the next
 remedy will be more apparent,

20
00:02:51,354 --> 00:03:00,198
more clear and you will be able to go
deeper and help this patient deeper.

21
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:13,896
This is a good example of fears that
went straight to the physical body.

22
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,031
The body does not have anymore
 the possibility to somatise the fears

23
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:29,521
 and the fears are exploding. She comes
to the Homeopath, he gives most probably a
 very high potency.

24
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:32,521
What potency you gave, you remember?

25
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:37,427
-1000.

26
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:47,063
-Not very high, eh? It's quite high and the stiffness as well as the fears are reduced.

27
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:54,938
Most probably, I don't know the case,
but most probably this case has been

28
00:03:55,042 --> 00:04:00,917
left with some symptoms now,
is that correct?

29
00:04:01,021 --> 00:04:05,958
-That's correct.

30
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:15,229
-These examples are important because you bring examples from your own practice

31
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,854
and it's important for others to listen.

32
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:25,677
-For me it was so interesting because these
fears before had never been in the foreground.

33
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:36,583
-This is exactly what we're saying here.
The fears maybe they were

34
00:04:36,688 --> 00:04:40,500
 not existing in the first place.

35
00:04:40,604 --> 00:04:46,625
By the strength of the organism they were
 gone to the physical body.

36
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:56,292
And then the second fears, the body cannot handle and then they are exploding.

37
00:05:04,646 --> 00:05:14,625
-I don't really agree with what you said before that it's always less difficult to treat a child.

38
00:05:15,531 --> 00:05:23,896
-Don't forget, he's a pediatrician so he has
an opinion which is quite serious.

39
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:36,469
-If they have severe hereditary problems,
I think the child will take a lot of time before
 you find the remedy.

40
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:50,271
-This is true, he has faced the problem
 because he sees the children. In children
you do not have the possibility to get

41
00:05:50,375 --> 00:06:01,479
easily the symptoms, you rely upon observation of the parents and that makes it already quite difficult because you don't have the original

42
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:09,896
 information from the baby. 'I'm afraid'.
Like in the case of encephalomyelitis which I described to you, tremendous

43
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:20,563
fear of the child and the mother thought it was courageous because it was taking all these injections without talking at all without crying.

44
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:28,375
Total misinterpretation of the woman concerning the emotional level of the child.

45
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:43,688
But what I said is this: that if we have a pneumonia in a child and a pneumonia
in an old person, equal things,

46
00:06:43,865 --> 00:06:53,990
that pneumonia on the child will be easier
to respond once we find the remedy. He says, how do we find the remedy?

47
00:06:54,094 --> 00:07:06,542
That is some difficulties we have there concerning how easy is for us to get the information for the child.

48
00:07:06,646 --> 00:07:17,010
 A child is very difficult to describe symptoms,
a baby especially but still many times we have

49
00:07:17,115 --> 00:07:24,344
 very obvious symptoms in the children,
which give us the peculiarity

50
00:07:24,938 --> 00:07:29,958
we are seeking for in order to prescribe
the correct remedy.

51
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:39,063
-I have two questions. When you say,
take off the first layer you mean the bottom
one or the top one?

52
00:07:39,177 --> 00:07:52,667
-The top one. Here in his case, Acon.
was the first. This is stiffness in his case

53
00:07:54,094 --> 00:08:01,625
and these are different other remedies.
Now this person gets another shock

54
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:13,000
and this fear that was so little
becomes like this, fear of death.

55
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:26,917
And then the stifness becomes a minor thing concerning the present fears but still is there.

56
00:08:27,313 --> 00:08:36,417
You give the Aconite, then this goes down and that goes down and all this goes away and then you had the next layer.

57
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:42,167
-How does the intensity of a symptom go into that painting? I don't quite understand.

58
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:54,385
You have different diseases, like heart disease, severe or minor heart disease, how does
it go into that?

59
00:08:54,490 --> 00:09:07,719
-It goes according to your knowledge of Medicine. Your knowledge will tell you if this is
 a severe endocarditis

60
00:09:07,823 --> 00:09:17,344
or a minor endocarditis.
Your experience as a doctor will tell you that

61
00:09:17,448 --> 00:09:24,604
 and you know what might be a
dangerous or not a dangerous situation.

62
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:30,708
This is according to your medical knowledge.

63
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:41,083
-Does this mean in the case of Acon. that luckily Acon. was able to treat two levels at once?

64
00:09:41,292 --> 00:09:53,406
-Not two levels, one level that was aggravated further. Acon. was needed as a first remedy,
 at the age of 6,

65
00:09:53,510 --> 00:10:03,448
it remained there as Acon. level; there comes another shock and makes the Acon. picture much stronger.

66
00:10:03,552 --> 00:10:06,531
Then you say, oh my God this is Acon.

67
00:10:07,042 --> 00:10:14,760
In spite of the fact you may have been given Sulph. or Lyc. before, without effect.

68
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,833
You may have been given the underlying
remedy even before the Aconite without

69
00:10:20,115 --> 00:10:26,604
 having the effect of releasing
that stiffness which means that

70
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:34,802
you gave either prematurely the underlying remedies or your remedy was wrong.

71
00:10:35,094 --> 00:10:48,896
Let us say, you've given Ars., none of these remedies, not Acon. or you gave Phos. and then this and that, no effect.

72
00:10:50,865 --> 00:10:58,292
It changes a little and then the shock comes
and the Acon. picture becomes so strong.

73
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:07,990
I have said many times that Acon. is not to be considered as an acute remedy for common cold.

74
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:18,938
It is remedy to be used for chronic conditions
 and also for deep chronic conditions, this is one more proof.

75
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:30,625
-I have one more question to this Aconite case. Could it not be possible that he had treated the patient before

76
00:11:30,729 --> 00:11:38,479
and isn't also possible that he gave different remedies which only uncovered the Acon. layer

77
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:44,448
which was maybe one of the underlying layers
and that at this time when the Acon. layer was revealed

78
00:11:44,552 --> 00:11:48,490
 she had a second shock which
made it more pronounced.

79
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:58,729
-It is possible of course. This person with Acon. she had a grief and then another grief and another grief

80
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:05,500
and then on top of the  Acon., there was
a Nat-m layer developed, and then he gave
the Nat-m and

81
00:12:05,604 --> 00:12:14,365
took away some of the symptoms. Stiffness
 and other symptoms which belong to the Acon. remained,

82
00:12:14,469 --> 00:12:23,188
then the shock came, then the
 fears appeared, that is also true.

83
00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:37,719
But what I say is that one time the organism
 itself does what the homeopathic remedy
will do.

84
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:48,292
It somatises, it takes the fears and put them
 on the physical level. The organism by itself did this.

85
00:12:49,865 --> 00:12:59,208
-George I want to ask you a question about melanoma. I had a patient, he's been with me
 for 6 years.

86
00:12:59,313 --> 00:13:07,271
He came to me 2-3 weeks after he
was operated for melanoma on his face.

87
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:18,979
I took his case carefully and
 I came up with Arg-n.

88
00:13:19,083 --> 00:13:26,229
There were clear symptoms of
anxiety and many symptoms on Arg-n.

89
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:38,177
 I used it for 4 years, 200 and so on.
He became greatly improved, mentally,

90
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:46,875
emotionally and he even started to practice as
 a psychologist. He got a degree and he became

91
00:13:46,979 --> 00:13:57,542
very successful and somewhere around 4
 years after treatment, it was discovered

92
00:13:57,646 --> 00:14:09,448
a metastasis of the original melanoma in his brain. I was actually very upset because I thought

93
00:14:09,552 --> 00:14:14,698
 the remedy was so good, why
did he get this metastasis?

94
00:14:14,802 --> 00:14:27,510
But he was very courageous and he got himself operated by a good neurosurgeon and much to my delight he recovered very well.

95
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:40,115
He continued to do very well, he still came to me occasionally and I repeated the Arg-n a few times.

96
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:54,844
Last year, he had no remedy for almost one year and appeared symptoms of Sulphur. There was no doubt about it.

97
00:14:55,188 --> 00:15:02,000
I gave one dose Sulphur 10M
and he has been very well since.

98
00:15:02,104 --> 00:15:07,094
Can you comment and show me some guidance? He has been extremely well,

99
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:15,500
he calls me from time to time, he refers
 patients from time and he is very successful.

100
00:15:15,917 --> 00:15:20,271
-Before I give you an explanation I will
 say a similar case with a friend of mine.

101
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:26,438
We were playing when we were children,
more or less my age about 25 years ago,

102
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:39,167
he came with a melanoma and I prescribed
for him and 25 years there is no relapse.

103
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:45,990
Different type of melanoma, I think it was on
 his chest or something, if I remember well.

104
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:58,865
What happened in your case, most probably,
is that: If we suppose that Arg-n was correct,

105
00:16:01,396 --> 00:16:09,781
then maybe we can suppose that the
next remedy you did not see.

106
00:16:10,042 --> 00:16:16,719
 It was a Sulphur, and you did not see it.
 So after Arg-n, you might have given

107
00:16:16,823 --> 00:16:20,156
different other remedies but not Sulphur.

108
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:33,385
Then the organism progresses and goes towards disease and eventually the defence mechanism

109
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:43,521
 throws out symptoms which for you at this time are clear and you give it and then he becomes very well.

110
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:54,719
That means Sulphur might have been indicated six months after the Arg-n and you missed this possibility.

111
00:16:54,823 --> 00:17:03,802
As a result you gave wrong remedies, even
 Arg-n after you repeated it might not have been indicated.

112
00:17:04,115 --> 00:17:14,604
So we consider it as the wrong remedy after
 the 2d, 3rd repetition. That means the disease progresses

113
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:22,740
and it reaches a point where the organism is really shaken and throws out a picture, you say a picture of Sulphur.

114
00:17:22,844 --> 00:17:34,854
This is a case where we have a lot of hope,
 when the remedy is clear and the reaction is very good,

115
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:43,583
then we can say, inspite of metastasis he
may be living another 10 years. How old is he?

116
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:08,625
-Every time he got Arg-n it was
repeated at long intervals, in high potencies.

117
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:15,760
He would report great improvement
of his mental and emotional condition.

118
00:18:16,781 --> 00:18:19,271
-Why you stress mental and emotional?

119
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:31,521
-Because he had mental-emotional anxiety,
 lack of confidence, he was angry with his
 wife

120
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,146
and all of that seemed to improve.
His desire for sweets became less and less,

121
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:49,000
his eating habits became very nice and he
 felt very much at ease in every day life.

122
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,042
-After he became at ease, then Arg-n
is not anymore indicated.

123
00:18:56,646 --> 00:19:04,542
-Is it possible that without the Arg-n. the metastasis would have take place

124
00:19:04,646 --> 00:19:09,604
much sooner rather than so many years later?

125
00:19:09,708 --> 00:19:19,552
-Definitely, my answer is definitely because
if the melanoma is of such type that will

126
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:26,792
have metastasis, the metastasis will
come much sooner if the organism is weak.

127
00:19:27,896 --> 00:19:34,406
-Also the metastasis was not large, it was very small metastasis. It was easy to detect and it was operated

128
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:42,583
and he came back home within less than one week. So what could I have done better?

129
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:50,396
Secondly, why did I not see Sulphur
is my second question.

130
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,427
This is speculation but I'm trying to
see what could I have done better?

131
00:20:00,531 --> 00:20:05,146
Because now the  man is doing
 very well, inspite the surgery.

132
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:20,229
-I have also made the same mistakes. There
 is a kind of accusation, everyone of us makes similar mistakes.

133
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:30,406
Don't think that I don't make mistakes.
I could made as well the same mistake,

134
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:42,188
that means not recognizing the next remedy
though it might be apparent for somebody else, even for a novice.

135
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:55,875
He sticks his feet out or covers and a novice knows that Sulphur sticks his feet out of covers

136
00:20:55,979 --> 00:21:00,115
and because of that he gives Sulphur and does better than you that you know all the Materia Medica

137
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:07,094
and all the Repertories and you have
eaten all the books of Materia Medica.

138
00:21:07,604 --> 00:21:13,417
And he still comes and says,
how could I not have thought about it?

139
00:21:26,844 --> 00:21:38,333
-He said I cannot wait to eat at around 11-11:30,
 I have to bring a sandwich, and my feet are out at night and are burning

140
00:21:38,438 --> 00:21:45,271
And I said, I don't give you Arg-n anymore,
I gave you Sulphur and I gave one dose only

141
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:48,740
and now for one year he does not come back.

142
00:21:48,844 --> 00:22:04,958
-He will not come back. Was anybody in
London when I took a case about 1983-4.

143
00:22:08,115 --> 00:22:16,083
I took a case of AIDS and I predicted
this man is going to live at least 20 more years.

144
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:22,708
 Was anybody present? Do you remember,
 a Sulphur case from Germany?

145
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:33,625
Remind me to tell you the name
of the doctor who presented the case,

146
00:22:33,729 --> 00:22:39,292
 I would like to see whether
 this person is still alive.

147
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:46,229
-So, a disturbance on the upper level of
 the emotional level is more threatening

148
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:50,448
than a disturbance on the
bottom of the mental level?

149
00:22:50,552 --> 00:23:02,938
-No, no. There is a corresponding here
between emotional-physical-mental.

150
00:23:03,042 --> 00:23:15,521
The corresponding mental or physical, for instance, if the disturbance on the emotional
is here

151
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:29,115
and it is doing better, it will go on the
mental level here. It will not go there.

152
00:23:29,219 --> 00:23:45,865
If it goes there, it's a suppression. It has to go
 on a level which is better in its correspondence than the original case.

153
00:23:49,333 --> 00:24:01,938
A disease in the mental level which is equal in severity with an emotional, then it's more serious.

154
00:24:02,042 --> 00:24:07,990
This problem here is more serious
than this problem on the emotional.

155
00:24:08,094 --> 00:24:12,250
Because they are on the same level.

156
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,229
-Patients which after treatment say,
these fears I never had before,

157
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:40,656
is it possible that they are born with 3 or 4
 layers as we have on the board there?

158
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:49,479
And then they come for treatment at the age
of maybe 20 years? And we, slowly but steadily, take away the layers?

159
00:24:49,583 --> 00:24:57,667
And then if we reach a level of Calc then
the person develops Calc fears?

160
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:12,115
-Yes sure, it can develop. But these fears are not as serious as Acon. fear that was originally.

161
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:28,333
A fear has different shades or different intensity, each fear. You take fear of death and he says, sometimes I have fear of death.

162
00:25:29,313 --> 00:25:39,927
 Another person says, I fear death constantly
 and another person says, I fear death so much
 that I don't go out of my house.

163
00:25:40,979 --> 00:25:43,990
That is a different intensity fear.

164
00:25:44,094 --> 00:25:58,750
The first time, Acon<i>.</i> will take the very great intensity fear, then the fear remains in a lesser degree, Calc. will take it away.

165
00:26:01,313 --> 00:26:13,490
The same with headaches. Severe headaches, you give Bell and then he says, 'I'm much better'.

166
00:26:13,594 --> 00:26:15,354
Why are you much better?

167
00:26:15,458 --> 00:26:21,854
'Because my headaches do not paralyze me,
 now I can go at least at work. Before I had to stay in my home

168
00:26:21,958 --> 00:26:26,375
because the headaches
were so strong, I could not work'.

169
00:26:26,479 --> 00:26:37,271
This lesser headaches, still are there
and they are taken away by Calc.

170
00:26:37,375 --> 00:26:44,063
A little bit of change in the nature of the headaches, the other symptoms change also

171
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:49,531
a little bit, then you give Calc.
and takes away the rest of the headaches.

172
00:26:50,573 --> 00:26:57,229
-Is this the explanation for the patient saying,
 'well I have never in my life had these fears before.

173
00:26:57,333 --> 00:27:01,583
I experienced them for the first time'.

174
00:27:02,042 --> 00:27:08,490
-When the patient says, 'I have a fear
I never experienced', it is very relative.

175
00:27:08,833 --> 00:27:15,781
He may have experienced the fears but in a
such less degree that he did not pay attention.

176
00:27:20,135 --> 00:27:34,646
Even in a proving of a remedy, has a kind of similarity with the genetic predispositions

177
00:27:35,052 --> 00:27:39,094
of the person in order to bring out
such symptoms. There is a similarity.

178
00:27:42,333 --> 00:27:49,094
But within these 3 different levels I must tell you that I'm absolutely insecure in swimming and

179
00:27:49,385 --> 00:27:56,667
 I have real problems following you. In this jumping physical-mental-emotional level.

180
00:27:56,854 --> 00:28:04,427
-How it happens? The mechanism?

181
00:28:06,531 --> 00:28:13,188
-Yes, I have not understood the mechanism.
In the case of him, since he has an amelioration

182
00:28:13,292 --> 00:28:22,094
on the emotional level, can you exclude an aggravation on the mental level in this case?

183
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:33,844
-No, you can not exclude but the aggravation
on the mental level it will be minute. Of no great importance.

184
00:28:37,135 --> 00:28:48,208
-One more question. I'm treating someone
 who has compulsive neurosis.

185
00:28:51,375 --> 00:29:06,510
Suppose this person ameliorates and he then develops either diabetes or high blood pressure.

186
00:29:06,615 --> 00:29:12,021
So if I understand correctly and I'm not
sure, this would be an amelioration?

187
00:29:12,177 --> 00:29:14,146
-Yes.

188
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:20,271
-Now, I'm treating this endocrine problem and during this treatment he develops a depression

189
00:29:20,313 --> 00:29:27,583
with suicidal thoughts. Is this an aggravation?

190
00:29:32,802 --> 00:29:42,813
-She said, suicidal depression. Suicidal depression means at any moment the patient
 will jump.

191
00:29:42,917 --> 00:29:48,646
This is different than depression. If you ask
 this class, do you have depression?

192
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:53,229
 Everyone will say I have some
depression, little, bigger etc.

193
00:29:53,333 --> 00:30:07,760
If you say suicidal depression means a person who is sitting there - Aurum state - and meditate all the time how to kill himself.

194
00:30:07,844 --> 00:30:15,875
Then, this is an aggravation.
The depression is an amelioration.

195
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:28,833
It is a matter of intensity.
Sometimes it is difficult to get to

196
00:30:28,938 --> 00:30:43,708
 know what is more serious. A suicidal depression or a heart condition?

197
00:30:46,063 --> 00:30:50,854
Usually the heart condition,
if it developed after a treatment

198
00:30:50,958 --> 00:31:02,208
for suicidal depression, a heart condition is better though it endangers the physical
 health of the person.

199
00:31:04,583 --> 00:31:14,469
Either we like it or not, these are the facts.
 These are described in paragraph,

200
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:22,802
you go and find the paragraph in which Hahnemann describes exactly that.

201
00:31:26,427 --> 00:31:42,313
That when a physical condition goes away,
you may have a suppression where the
 problem goes into mental-emotional.

202
00:31:42,375 --> 00:31:51,167
And when you treat this person on the mental-emotional, the physical problem reappears.

203
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:12,917
Where in the Organon, Hahnemann says that physical conditions can be suppressed

204
00:32:13,021 --> 00:32:22,844
and mental-emotional conditions
 may appear? And vice-versa.

205
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:37,427
During treatment, you treat a mental-emotional and the physical condition becomes deteriorated.

206
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,875
Yeats, I think an English poet....

207
00:32:50,063 --> 00:32:51,938
-Irish.

208
00:32:55,844 --> 00:33:03,938
-Irish? Who wrote a very interesting poem,
I remember a phrase which says:

209
00:33:09,625 --> 00:33:25,531
'they doubt and sigh and do not love
at all, of these am I, of these am I'.

210
00:33:26,823 --> 00:33:39,833
That means he was in a depression state
and he was expressing the torture of an intellectual.

211
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:55,375
They doubt about everything and they sigh and then the feelings go away. And then he says, of this type I am.

212
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:09,448
It's beautiful, it is expressing a
state of a human development.

213
00:34:10,292 --> 00:34:15,219
 As we go and go, we have more
of this type of people today.

214
00:34:19,854 --> 00:34:31,271
-My question is, as you told us, if I understand
 it correctly that the more layers we have in
our patient,

215
00:34:31,375 --> 00:34:41,188
the less obvious picture will be at the first layer.
 And the more obvious picture, this will give us idea

216
00:34:41,292 --> 00:34:48,833
that the closer to the bottom, constitutional
layer we are in. That surprises me.

217
00:34:48,938 --> 00:34:52,031
- Are you a mathematician?
- Yes, I'm a mathematician.

218
00:34:57,625 --> 00:35:02,188
- Really?
- Yes really. I am theoretical physics.

219
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:06,688
- Not mathematics.
- No, it's the same.

220
00:35:13,042 --> 00:35:20,375
-Many times that you prescribe for people for Russian group, for some cases we took here,

221
00:35:20,479 --> 00:35:26,625
for some of them you did just give one dose of let's say 10M and that's all.

222
00:35:26,729 --> 00:35:33,625
For some persons like you did to my case, you prescribe 200, next day 1M, next day 10M.

223
00:35:33,646 --> 00:35:40,521
 Does that mean that you expect if you do it so aggressively, attack the vital force?

224
00:35:40,625 --> 00:35:49,427
 And you suspect that those persons are closer to the bottom and it's time to push a bit?

225
00:35:50,938 --> 00:36:07,813
-Mostly, I repeat, thinking two things.
One that maybe the organism is more
lazy,

226
00:36:07,917 --> 00:36:15,000
and it needs a little bit more pushing
before starting go towards a cure.

227
00:36:16,156 --> 00:36:27,396
The other time, I may think...we are in America, from where will you get the medicine?

228
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:39,646
I'm not convinced that all pharmacies are good. So I may do it like this with the hope that if 1M
 is not potentized,

229
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:49,510
then 10M will be potentized or 50M, one of
the three will be potentized. So there are two ways for doing that.
