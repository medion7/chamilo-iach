1
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:08,376
Well, you are a graduate class and I'm going to ralate to you only the problems of Homeopathy.

2
00:01:08,699 --> 00:01:14,155
The first years, we all say how wonderful Homeopathy is, how easy it is

3
00:01:14,795 --> 00:01:20,490
and you can cure everything very fast, very easily with one remedy and it's finished.

4
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:28,363
By the last years you ralate only the problems, beacause people most propably come to hear only the problems.

5
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:46,043
So what I'm trying to make my students aware of, the last one or two years, are problems concerning prescribing, our prescribing.

6
00:01:50,310 --> 00:02:01,940
I honestly say that if they were not these problems Homeopathy would have been at this moment already established in the world.

7
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:18,690
You will hear what are the problems which you have to be aware, otherwise you will be disappointed.

8
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,340
What do you think is the first problem in Homeopathy?

9
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:33,940
I say a problem after you have given a remedy which is correct.

10
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:44,140
Say you overcome all the other problems of studying and finding the remedy you overcame all that,  you are a graduate student,

11
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:53,270
you are able to prescribe correctly you gave the correct remedy, according to your understanding and then the problem starts.

12
00:02:54,530 --> 00:03:03,760
What might be the first problem which you will encounter for many times and if you are not aware of that problem, you will lose a lot of your cases.

13
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:13,190
What do you think will be a problem after you have prescribed the correct remedy?

14
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,060
-That it will become worse and better.

15
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:38,170
-But this is in your knowledge and you expect an aggravation. So this is really not a problem.

16
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,320
-No reaction.

17
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:55,520
-Yes. How is this 'no reaction' going to be expressed?

18
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:10,770
One of the biggest problems that our society is facing, I mean the western society the sophisticated society, the society in which we mostly deal at this moment.

19
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:29,590
Our problem is because of the sophistication, because of the complexity of the individuals, because of the preconceptions; I took a remedy so I have to be well perhaps after a week or after 3 -5 days etc.

20
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:49,680
Because of these preconceptions, notions, you will get many times after the remedy has acted and it is the correct one, you will get an answer which it says, no effect.

21
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:58,150
The person who has received the remedy, which is the correct remedy, will say I have no change. I am the same.

22
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:05,380
-Now this answer, 'I am the same', for me it doesn't mean anymore anything.

23
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:20,640
There the problem starts. Because when you have a case and the person says, 'I had a big reaction and it feels wonderful', I say thank you very much, bye, bye, we finished.

24
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:34,820
The problem starts when you have given the right remedy and the person comes and says, 'well....'. Usually they almost like it.

25
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:48,390
 I will show you a case where actually I will drive her to the point to say 'I don't want to be well'.

26
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:55,800
Now do you expect that such case in the beginning will tell you, I'm so much better?

27
00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:04,950
No, it's too complex, too sophisticated, too confused emotionally the people.

28
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:16,860
They don't understand what is happening to them, their disease has become part of their lives and their disease is a complex within the society.

29
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:43,880
If you don't realize that this remedy is acting in spite of the person saying 'no effect' what you are going to do? You prescribe another remedy, it's very natural. Because you say OK there is no effect.

30
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:56,040
I have seen from the cases they brought me internationally in the seminars because as you know, I prescribe in different countries before the seminars.

31
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:08,780
The cases that they bring to me, most of them, when I take the follow up, you will hear this answer. Why?

32
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:17,660
 Because they are the most complicated, the most difficult cases that they have received a lot of other remedies, they are mistrustful, they don't expect much

33
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:33,270
they don't say if they are little changes, they will not mention, the result is no effect! I am the same, I have no changes and this is a point where you have to be very aware.

34
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:47,801
If, on the other hand, you take too much notice of that, then you never change your remedy and if it is wrong, you continue with the wrong remedy.

35
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:54,751
And you say, wait, wait, wait and then what, nothing is happening.

36
00:07:54,790 --> 00:08:03,520
If you wait with the right remedy, changes will start to happen almost in spite of the will of the person.

37
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:15,760
He doesn't want to get well but he will get, never mind what. So this we have to be very aware of, it's a big, big problem.

38
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:45,760
Then the second problem. Something, which I have found out that practitioners who use Homeopathy in the way that we do, in the classical way, prescribing one remedy etc. many times they misunderstand the reaction.

39
00:08:47,340 --> 00:09:07,500
What may happen is that there is a reaction but the reaction appears to be either the wrong reaction, appears to be wrong.

40
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:17,680
What do we mean appears to be wrong reaction?
When is a wrong reaction in Homeopathy?

41
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:32,011
When the physical symptomatology is getting better and the mental-emotional levels of the case are getting worse, right? Do you all agree? Do you know this rule?

42
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:54,150
When the physical symptomatology, when a pain is getting better, when an eruption is getting better, when a physical pain is disappearing and mental-emotional the person is getting worse, then we say this is the wrong reaction.

43
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:06,680
This is a rule in Homeopathy. You cannot say I agree or I don't agree because it is a principle.

44
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:28,501
And according to the model I have given the 3 cones, mental, emotional and physical, I have said that anything that goes from outside which is the physical,

45
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:42,671
anything that goes towards the center when the disease is progressing in this way, then we say it's not a good sign.

46
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:51,220
In this we have to agree. It's not a matter of opinion, it is a fact.

47
00:10:53,630 --> 00:11:03,100
But what do I mean when I say the reaction appears to be wrong, to take the wrong direction?

48
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:24,070
When the person will say, well now emotionally I'm upset, I'm this and then, I have this mental symptomatology now, you say what have I done?

49
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:33,880
It must have been in your experience, if you have enough experience in Homeopathy you must have seen cases where this took place.

50
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:45,380
In such case either you have given the wrong remedy or what? Can anybody tell me?

51
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:57,570
I would like before you answer because the class can benefit from your experience that you put your hand up so I can point out.

52
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,280
- Old symptoms come from the past.

53
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:28,161
-It is not possible that you have physical symptoms which are worse than symptoms in the emotional level and that may appear that the disease is getting worse.

54
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:42,110
For example I thought that psoriasis can be worse than emotional pathology on the emotional level.

55
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:52,990
-So far we had two answers. One is that this symptomatology may be coming from the past.

56
00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:04,600
What is your observation here? Mental symptomatology coming from the past.

57
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:17,571
Here you have to be careful. Homeopathy is Mathematics. I guarantee about that.

58
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:34,041
You have to have a logical mind and think logically. And don't come and tell me in the end, you have intuition;  that's why you found the remedy or you said this or you asked this question.

59
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:46,760
No, I have no intuition and to prove that, my students are better than me. Do they have more intuition than me?

60
00:13:55,330 --> 00:14:12,370
If you think logically, you will say in this occasion, this person he was mentally ill in the past and now he is physically ill, he has a colitis.

61
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:21,681
I cure his colitis and his disease is going back to the mental, this is most improbable.

62
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:29,361
The most probable is that he was mentally ill and because he was getting better, he got eventually the colitis.

63
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:43,091
It is very improbable that we have the second answer, where he was mentally ill, that means he had some anxiety in the past not very great anxiety

64
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:51,880
and now he had a severe ulcerative colitis. We treat the ulcerative colitis and now the anxiety is coming back.

65
00:14:52,120 --> 00:15:05,040
This is a case where you may say, yes I feel now more easily excitable like I was feeling 15 years ago. That is a symptom returning.

66
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:14,000
But what I ask appears to be wrong I don't mean this case.

67
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:25,160
What is another possibility that you may have found from your experience?

68
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:39,750
-To be the right remedy but the patient is too sick, it is the only way it could go.

69
00:15:41,600 --> 00:16:01,221
-Yes, it's quite close. It might be the correct remedy, the person is quite sick and the remedy activates another level of the disease

70
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:08,400
 which includes mental or emotional symptomatology.

71
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:34,900
The person was too sick and the remedy you have given activates another level that means treats the person on one layer and brings out another layer, another remedy.

72
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:52,650
The remedy you had given was the correct one, it was the only one that could start the case and the next layer that activates will have the quality of being a clear remedy.

73
00:16:53,400 --> 00:17:09,120
So when appears to be wrong, that means stimulating a level which has also mental emotional symptomatology, this layer which comes, has clear symptomatology.

74
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:21,091
Where initially your case was not clear. You say, is this remedy, is that remedy, is the other remedy, there are 5 remedies indicated, I don't know which to give.

75
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:38,560
You give 1 remedy and it produces a big reaction, the person gets emotionally upset physical symptoms are there but if you take the next picture, you will see that that is a clear picture of Nat-m. now.

76
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:51,491
That means that your first remedy acted correctly in spite of activating this layer which needs now Nat-m. You have given Sepia, activated the layer, brought

77
00:17:51,530 --> 00:18:03,240
about certain symptomatology which is mental-emotional, as well as physical, but the remedy appears now to be more clear.

78
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:17,201
So when you will see this kind of reaction, don't be in a hurry to prescribe immediately. You say my remedy is wrong. No.

79
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:25,431
 Your remedy most probably is right and what you need now is a second remedy, which will follow the first one.

80
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:35,650
And then you will see the real effect, the curative effect. Your patient will never say I'm better during this stage.

81
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:46,680
 He may hint a few things here and there, maybe the energy a little bit here or maybe this is better, my tiredness is better

82
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:54,230
but he will relate to you a lot of other symptoms that are quite frightening sometimes.

83
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:12,850
I've brought cases to show you these points I'm relating.

84
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:21,830
I want you to have a practical experience of what I mean when I say these things.

85
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:28,360
So in the course I'm going to exemplify these points.

86
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:43,850
Because, as I said, unfortunately this class of cases is too big now and we have to be careful.

87
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:57,100
A third problem is, you have given the right remedy and the person comes and says 'nothing'. What it might mean?

88
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:08,680
And this is the most difficult to understand. And the most difficult to take action.

89
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:20,120
But unfortunately is happening more and more, in my practice at least.

90
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,080
Can anybody think?

91
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:36,280
Intoxication. The person is intoxicated so much that the remedy does not act, is that what you mean?

92
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:43,620
-He is intoxicated by environment or by social factors.

93
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,120
-Or by allopathic drugs?

94
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:56,831
- The amelioration seems not to last long.

95
00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:08,090
- I say 'no effect at all'.

96
00:21:08,129 --> 00:21:25,600
There is no doubt in your mind that the remedy produced no effect at all because you take all the symptoms, you see no reaction no adverse reaction no better reaction, no better somewhere, nothing.

97
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,920
 You see no change at all really.

98
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:47,880
Let us that you are certain about the remedy. This is a case of Nat-m, this is a case of Sulphur. I give Sulphur, nothing.

99
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:53,620
-No energy in the medicine.

100
00:21:55,110 --> 00:22:02,480
-The medicine is not prepared properly or the remedy has been spoiled in the pharmacy.

101
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:13,930
Unfortunately this is my experience again and again and again.

102
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:33,980
 And it's only because I prescribe. Many times I'm very certain and I say this is this remedy, give it from another pharmacy and then it acts.

103
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:46,960
We have to be aware that our remedies are not checked, cannot be checked at this moment and also I do not know how well they are produced on the first place.

104
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:08,120
Finally you find out that Boericke and Tafel 100 years ago produced some high potencies that still selling. How much of this is spoiled?

105
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:16,041
And maybe we're giving high potencies without any remedy inside.

106
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:27,041
Don't forget that there is the factor which says placebo effect, there is that factor and

107
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:33,571
we maybe dealing with this factor and for a long period of time we'll be happy that we're doing something.

108
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:46,720
In the meantime when we see some severe case because you are medical doctors and you have the possibility to give also antibiotics, you say take some antibiotics.

109
00:23:48,200 --> 00:24:02,630
Because you are afraid, you don't trust several things. Now these are the things I'm going to make you aware so you are more powered when you prescribe.

110
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:15,441
You say this is a Pulsatilla case, why it does not act? The Pulsatilla case is so clear. If you know your Materia Medica and you know this is a Pulsatilla case, why it does not act?

111
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,990
 Let me try from another source. You have to.

112
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:44,660
In the course in London I will show you this Paris quadrifolia case.

113
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:56,171
One year ago in April a case of Paris came. I said, give Paris quadrifolia 30 or 200 I don't remember, one dose.

114
00:24:56,210 --> 00:25:08,280
She took one dose and came after 2 months and says, no effect, nothing. No change in the case. The Paris did not touch the case at all.

115
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:21,321
Of course from my experience I said, this cannot be, this is a Paris quadrifolia case. Give from another 2 pharmacies, take the same potency.

116
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:29,280
They gave the remedy from another 2 pharmacies and I will show you the case now one year later.

117
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:41,401
 First of all I will show you the reaction, what happened when the remedy was potentized. The woman says, 'now I'm worse'. I said, in what worse?

118
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:56,161
She said, 'my voice...', complained for different things. The remedy is acting but in the video you will say, it is not acting. This remedy made this woman worse.

119
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:09,430
 And I say, no, no, it has acted and why. And you will see a year later what has happened with the transformation of that woman. The transformation of the case.

120
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:25,281
How the hell can we trust it's Paris Quadrifolia?
 If it Sulph., you know Sulph., Puls. you know Puls., Lyc. and Nat-m. but Paris you cannot know, you might have made a mistake.

121
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:36,650
And you change your remedy and forget about it. You will never find the remedy again because this woman, she has been given different remedies and nothing has touched her.

122
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:46,060
In this woman we exemplify what we call a placebo effect.

123
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:52,070
How is that possible that this woman I prescribed the remedy and she said, no effect?

124
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:59,481
And I prescribed the same remedy, the woman does not even know, the second time she has a big reaction, where is the placebo effect?

125
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:07,750
You eliminate completely the possibility of placebo effect because the first time you see
 the patient has no reaction at all.

126
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:14,921
You are the same person, you gave another remedy or the same remedy from another pharmacy and then there is a big reaction.

127
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:25,200
Then you know for sure that this is your remedy that is acting and eventually you wait long enough and you see the effect.

128
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:44,960
The fourth reason for which you may not see a reaction after your first remedy, what it is?

129
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:04,160
-Antidotes.

130
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:25,170
- You have to find out whether the person at the same time as he kept taking your medicine, he kept on drinking coffee, he kept on taking cortisone, antibiotics, the other remedies that he was taking.

131
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:33,090
There is a possibility that because there is antidotal effect, the effect of your remedy will not appear.

132
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:50,130
And many, many people will not tell you in the first interview that I have been taken for the last 10 years Largactil

133
00:28:50,800 --> 00:29:02,761
because they come to you for a skin problem or for a colitis but they have been taking chronically a very strong remedy, a very strong drug.

134
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:14,410
And they keep on continue taking it, what your remedy is going to do under Largactil or Aloperidin or psychotropic drugs of that order? Nothing.

135
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:27,400
These are the four main groups that you have to be aware of in your prescribing.

136
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:49,601
The first group is the most frequent, the person has no effect and the remedy has actually acted. The second group appears to be wrong by bringing about the wrong reaction

137
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:04,290
The third is no effect at all because no remedy and the fourth one is the antidotes.
