1
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:23,948
Many times we have to be careful. We have symptomatology on 3 levels, as we said,

2
00:00:24,052 --> 00:00:33,354
not always. If the symptoms are on the physical level forget the picture on mental, emotional.

3
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:45,719
This is normal. What is normal?

4
00:00:45,823 --> 00:00:53,792
When do we have symptoms
and when do we have normal?

5
00:00:53,896 --> 00:00:58,583
This person is normal in these levels.

6
00:00:58,688 --> 00:01:08,313
I said certain cases of Phosphorus may not
 have symptoms on mental or emotional

7
00:01:08,417 --> 00:01:15,031
and we say is normal. What is normal?

8
00:01:15,135 --> 00:01:23,135
When do we have a symptom and
 when we don't have a symptom?

9
00:01:24,177 --> 00:01:28,667
This is a question I'm asking.

10
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:52,250
What the society considers as normal?
 I want another definition.

11
00:01:57,135 --> 00:02:03,760
-It depends on the suffering of the person.

12
00:02:07,135 --> 00:02:16,490
-I think is when it doesn't bother
 him to function normally.

13
00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:27,427
-If he can fulfill his purpose in life.

14
00:02:31,896 --> 00:02:40,281
-She says when you are free from pain,
 you are free from passion and you are

15
00:02:40,385 --> 00:02:44,208
free from egotism, then
you have no symptoms.

16
00:02:53,292 --> 00:02:58,771
-The society considers somebody
 normal when he functions,

17
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:05,917
when he is seemingly balanced;
 then he is considered normal.

18
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:12,396
-When one is free from anything that could
hold him, he is free to choose what he likes,

19
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:21,094
free to do what he likes, free of any burden.

20
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:34,094
-Let me ask you another question.

21
00:03:34,198 --> 00:03:56,073
When you are born, will you be considered
as healthy at this moment of birth

22
00:03:57,375 --> 00:04:03,188
or you would be considered that
you have a predisposition for a

23
00:04:06,563 --> 00:04:14,490
certain disease which may
or may not develop later on ?

24
00:04:15,156 --> 00:04:23,740
How much of that constitution of the
newborn can be considered as healthy

25
00:04:23,844 --> 00:04:29,385
or not healthy, depending on what ?

26
00:04:30,042 --> 00:04:38,490
When you treat this person when you arrive
 at the point you say, now you are healthy?

27
00:04:41,896 --> 00:04:47,510
 Do we have an easy answer
for these questions?

28
00:04:49,354 --> 00:04:55,292
-I think healthy is when all needs are fulfilled.

29
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:15,542
-I need 20 women. I need 20 chocolates.

30
00:05:16,823 --> 00:05:27,323
-I think that it is relative things.
This idea, to be healthy is to be free,

31
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:31,073
to be without negative feeling and so on.

32
00:05:37,052 --> 00:05:43,188
-There are two different things which
are going on here. First we have an ideal

33
00:05:43,292 --> 00:05:50,969
definition of health in which we all agree
at least. If you don't agree you cannot say

34
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:59,771
 because I said it. But anyhow, we
suppose we agree in this idea.

35
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:09,250
That ideal health is freedom from
selfishness, egotism, freedom from being

36
00:06:09,354 --> 00:06:16,052
 enslaved in passions, freedom from
being enslaved in pain and discomfort.

37
00:06:17,385 --> 00:06:24,125
Now we come to the reality of
treating an individual saying:

38
00:06:24,229 --> 00:06:33,646
that individual is unhealthy in his liver or unhealthy in his feelings or unhealthy

39
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:52,146
 in his mind or his lungs. We have to have
 a guiding process to lead us to say:

40
00:06:52,250 --> 00:07:02,521
this individual is healthy in these levels and unhealthy in these levels. How do we go about?

41
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:10,521
To attain the ideal health as we said
and we agreed, nobody can attain it.

42
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:18,875
Nobody can attain it. Nobody can be
 free of egotism, free of selfishness.

43
00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:25,302
 If we stick it to our mind that I'm going
to free myself from all egotism

44
00:07:25,406 --> 00:07:29,208
you are going to have a delusion
eventually. It is not possible,

45
00:07:29,313 --> 00:07:39,969
 even the greatest, even the people
who are considered as saintly people,

46
00:07:40,073 --> 00:07:52,302
they have their own weak spots.
Now, were they unhealthy to what extend?

47
00:07:52,406 --> 00:08:01,406
Is it possible that they would become
healthy with the homeopathic remedy?

48
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:09,740
Somebody is very selfish. Is it possible with
 the homeopathic remedy to make him

49
00:08:09,844 --> 00:08:20,250
less egotistical? These are questions.

50
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:38,990
She says, that if we treat a person
with egotism, we give a remedy,

51
00:08:39,094 --> 00:08:49,667
the egotism becomes less and
the person is better in his egotism.

52
00:08:51,469 --> 00:09:02,740
-I don't think so. Maybe it will round the edges but he will succeed better in his egotism.

53
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:10,719
-Egotistical person you give the correct
 remedy, then his egotism will reduce

54
00:09:10,823 --> 00:09:21,250
and other values will go up, so his
development will be more easy.

55
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:40,813
-If you give a remedy his egotism will not
be less but it will make him suffer less

56
00:09:40,917 --> 00:09:45,875
himself as well as the people around him.

57
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:04,052
-The idea is that every individual
needs some kind of egotism

58
00:10:04,156 --> 00:10:09,385
because egotism has good qualities
as well, like integrity, sincerity etc.

59
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:18,854
So you may need this quality and
by giving the remedy you don't take away

60
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:24,104
the good qualities of egotism which
is helpful in an individual in order

61
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:29,781
to progress and to develop spiritually.

62
00:10:30,823 --> 00:10:38,792
-He will be more aware of his condition.
He will be uncomfortable with the fact that...

63
00:10:38,896 --> 00:10:46,500
Somebody who is really egoistic
 he doesn't bother at all.

64
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:55,271
But if he starts bothering,
maybe we will think twice.

65
00:10:56,052 --> 00:11:14,542
-Yes but not always the symptoms bother
 the person. They bother the others.

66
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:23,896
What I'm asking is from a totally
practical point of view.

67
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,438
You have an individual, you are treating him
 and from a totally practical point of view

68
00:11:28,542 --> 00:11:35,479
you want to see whether this individual is affected in his mental emotional level

69
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:44,344
and to what extend. Or you say, this person seems to be balanced from a totally

70
00:11:44,448 --> 00:11:51,896
practical point of view, as a healer.
People will come to you to be healed.

71
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,917
And because of all these theories that we
have and this information about the remedies,

72
00:11:59,021 --> 00:12:04,563
we start projecting and imagining things
and we may project upon the individual that

73
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:13,167
 we have in front of us, certain things which
are not really there on the individual.

74
00:12:13,271 --> 00:12:19,438
And we may make a case of Agaricus
where it is a case of Sulphur

75
00:12:19,542 --> 00:12:22,646
and a case of Phosphorus where
 it is a case of Natrum muriaticum.

76
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:32,646
This is what I try to clarify with this question.

77
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:41,271
And I found out that many Homeopaths
 they go wrong because of not

78
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:46,792
comprehending well these practical problems.

79
00:12:46,896 --> 00:12:58,333
He comes to you and he says, oh he looks
 like Phos, or he looks like Nat-m or Agar.

80
00:12:58,427 --> 00:13:04,365
But this person actually is normal
 in his mental, emotional level

81
00:13:04,469 --> 00:13:14,979
and he is suffering in his physical pathology.
His kidneys are affected, his liver, lungs

82
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:23,438
 his joints are affected and that's it.
Otherwise the person is quite normal,

83
00:13:23,542 --> 00:13:29,896
in the mental, emotional sphere.
How do we say he is normal?

84
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:40,792
What are the guiding lines for saying
so or making that statement?

85
00:13:48,156 --> 00:13:51,854
-I think the symptoms; he's supposed
 to come and complain about things.

86
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:55,729
First of all, take the first
symptom that complains about.

87
00:13:55,833 --> 00:14:00,604
And see the whole picture, the real
 picture whatever you see real,

88
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:06,427
not imagination, not all
kind of crap around.

89
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:13,354
-I think if the person has coherence, clarity
 and creativity of mind and also a state of

90
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:19,625
calmness of emotions, then the person is healthy; we do not have to treat the person.

91
00:14:23,823 --> 00:14:41,385
-Correct. Most of you have said more or less, correct things. But I still feel it's not very clear.

92
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:49,719
For instance, in questions like egotistical. You
go to the Repertory and you see 'egotistical':

93
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:57,354
Lach., Sulph., Calc., Plat. etc.
Some remedies say 'egotistical'.

94
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:07,146
What does that mean?
Who is not egotistical?

95
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:13,563
On the other hand we say, everyone
 is selfish, everyone is egotistical.

96
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:27,188
Now why there are so few remedies on the
rubric 'egotistical' since everybody has an

97
00:15:27,292 --> 00:15:38,490
 egotistical element, that means looking
 after himself, his own interests?

98
00:15:39,052 --> 00:15:45,510
Why in certain remedies we say,
this is pathology?

99
00:15:47,760 --> 00:16:03,438
-Egocentric and egotistical is more or less
 the same as far as we are concerned,

100
00:16:03,542 --> 00:16:10,510
we are talking about pathology. We are examining the pathology of the person.

101
00:16:12,385 --> 00:16:19,563
-I think the most important question is if
 the patient is suffering of this symptom.

102
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:22,167
Maybe egotism or anything else.

103
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:30,521
-But as we said, he may not be
suffering but others maybe suffering

104
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:37,563
because of that symptom, so then
again we have a problem.

105
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:45,104
You see the manic people, especially
 manic depressive people,

106
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:55,458
during the mania stage they feel wonderful.
They feel on the top of the world,

107
00:16:55,563 --> 00:17:06,781
they feel absolutely powerful and free but
 they may be doing things that hurt others.

108
00:17:07,781 --> 00:17:13,177
And then we put the labels
as manic depression.

109
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:29,771
-I come up again with the needs
of a baby. The need of a baby makes

110
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:38,063
an imprint when it is adult
for something it didn't get.

111
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:49,854
It is a blockage, disharmony and homeopathic remedy makes it harmonise again

112
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:55,417
and feel better, feel healthy.

113
00:17:56,958 --> 00:18:12,000
-I thought you said that a person once he
has his desires fulfilled, he is healthy.

114
00:18:12,781 --> 00:18:28,323
-But I say I have my desires fulfilled, I have
20 women, 20 chocolates. But am I healthy?

115
00:18:28,427 --> 00:18:35,448
Or I am over sexed or I have
all kinds of perversions etc.

116
00:18:41,646 --> 00:18:48,406
-You have been asking about egotism and
I think the pathological form of egotism

117
00:18:48,510 --> 00:19:07,292
is the lack of ability for
empathy to other people.

118
00:19:14,688 --> 00:19:24,635
-Ok, if we take this everyone has
 indifference to other's suffering.

119
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:33,229
Then you go to Phosphorus who has
empathy and we say this is pathology now.

120
00:19:33,938 --> 00:19:43,823
 Phosphorus has empathy so much, sympathy, suffers a lot and we say this is pathology.

121
00:19:56,563 --> 00:20:12,562
-We have to observe in that person
 whom we call egotistical,

122
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:17,250
whether he is creative, whether
 his creativity is affected.

123
00:20:17,354 --> 00:20:25,583
Creativity towards others and if this
is affected then there is pathology.

124
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:35,323
-I think Hahnemann gave a very good description of the healthy state in his par. 9 of the Organon.

125
00:20:35,427 --> 00:20:48,521
There he says, the body must serve the spirit
 as a tool to fulfill the higher goals of existence.

126
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:59,104
So if someone is in a manic state he cannot see his higher goals. So this is one important thing,

127
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:03,073
he must be able to see his higher
 goals and the other thing is,

128
00:21:03,177 --> 00:21:09,510
the body must be a good tool
to follow these higher goals.

129
00:21:12,052 --> 00:21:22,417
-This another question. Hahnemann
 in par.9 speaks about the balance

130
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:26,104
which comes with the homeopathic
 remedy and gives the opportunity

131
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:32,719
 for the individual to develop spiritually.
 This is not the question.

132
00:21:32,823 --> 00:21:43,104
There is another paragraph and you
have to find it, in which Hahnemann gives

133
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:58,583
what we may say this is pathology. We say
 now, this is pathology, this is not normal.

134
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:15,604
-I wanted to add something about this
egotism. I think the aim is to find the center,

135
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:26,667
the middle between the polarities of being too
much inside egotistical or too much outside.

136
00:22:27,229 --> 00:22:34,135
 There has to be a middle where we have
a balance between both polarities.

137
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:39,813
It's like in Phosphorus. Phosphorus is too
open to outside, then he also develops

138
00:22:39,917 --> 00:22:46,771
a border line case. But you have
to find a place in the middle.

139
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:53,229
A baby also has the right to
egotism as when it gets older

140
00:22:53,333 --> 00:23:01,844
and also concerning the time of life, you have different stages where you find the middle.

141
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:09,563
-You have to find the really middle
balance point between two polarities.

142
00:23:09,667 --> 00:23:17,958
If you go to extremes, to one or the other side, then most probably there is pathology.

143
00:23:20,042 --> 00:23:25,938
-I think many of the things that we
read in Repertory, we all experience

144
00:23:26,042 --> 00:23:33,250
in different circumstances. What actually
makes it pathology is if it is appropriate

145
00:23:33,354 --> 00:23:38,188
to the situation that you're actually in at that
time. For instance in children we do see

146
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:43,167
 a lot of egotism because they have high
needs and they have to get these needs.

147
00:23:51,802 --> 00:23:58,563
So it depends on the situation that
the person is in with egotism

148
00:23:58,667 --> 00:24:03,542
or cheerfulness or whatever
 is appropriate or not.

149
00:24:11,823 --> 00:24:17,990
-I think it's very dangerous if you
want to have a middle of everything.

150
00:24:18,094 --> 00:24:24,990
If somebody always is in balance,
no specialties, then never any special

151
00:24:25,094 --> 00:24:29,688
 or extraordinary thing would happen. We wouldn't have any extraordinary people,

152
00:24:30,458 --> 00:24:36,104
 for example artists always
were special, extraordinary.

153
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:41,646
 In a certain way also pathological because otherwise they would not be able to create

154
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:51,604
what they have created. You always have to see in what time the person lives and who is judging.

155
00:24:52,406 --> 00:24:59,521
-It is dangerous to say or to state or to
accept that everybody has to be balanced

156
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:07,479
and everybody has to be within a range.
Actually there are people who have gone

157
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:12,365
into extreme, like artists, like very
creative people who have done

158
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:18,010
extraordinary things, who have
 gone away from normal,

159
00:25:18,115 --> 00:25:23,302
maybe this is pathology
but still very creative.

160
00:25:23,406 --> 00:25:32,083
-And my question is when do
we consider that this pathology?

161
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:42,625
Hahnemann gives 3 sources from which
we get information about diseases.

162
00:25:45,542 --> 00:25:49,688
The patient himself.

163
00:25:55,229 --> 00:26:03,156
 People around the patient.

164
00:26:07,542 --> 00:26:16,802
Physician's observation.

165
00:26:20,313 --> 00:26:30,635
If you follow these rules of Hahnemann
 you will always be able to state

166
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:39,583
whether there is pathology, there is no
 pathology and when the pathology has started.

167
00:26:41,271 --> 00:26:50,719
So actually each individual is different
and has qualities which are unique.

168
00:26:53,229 --> 00:27:01,458
Therefore nobody can say this is normal.
How many times you eat a day?

169
00:27:03,292 --> 00:27:13,563
The normal is one time the day. I can tell
you if you eat one time the day, you go to the

170
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:21,281
Caucasus people they eat one time
the day and live 100 years.

171
00:27:21,385 --> 00:27:35,229
The normal is 3 times or 1 time?
To have sex is good, it's natural.

172
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:39,229
The normal is 1 time/day,
1/week or 1/month?

173
00:27:39,469 --> 00:27:42,771
There are different ideas, different
people with different constitutions,

174
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:45,542
will do different things.

175
00:27:47,021 --> 00:27:52,635
So what is normal? Essential things
like eating, having sex, every day

176
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:59,990
things that will come against immediately
some problems, if we put theoretical questions.

177
00:28:00,094 --> 00:28:08,438
Here Hahnemann says, wait a moment
 I will tell you when there is pathology:

178
00:28:08,542 --> 00:28:15,542
If the patient tells you 'that bothers me'.
Then it's pathology.

179
00:28:15,646 --> 00:28:30,833
I used to be very fast in my mind and now my mind is slow, this bothers me. This is pathology.

180
00:28:30,938 --> 00:28:40,875
I used to have a lot of energy,
I cannot drag my feet, this is pathology.

181
00:28:40,979 --> 00:28:49,479
I used to drink two glasses of water,
now I need 20 glasses. This is pathology.

182
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:57,563
So the patient will state the
changes that feels in himself.

183
00:28:57,667 --> 00:29:03,521
But Hahnemann says, this is not enough
 to determine that all the pathology

184
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:09,615
is what the patient says. Because the
 patient might not be aware that he has

185
00:29:09,719 --> 00:29:14,313
some other problems which the
other people around can perceive

186
00:29:14,417 --> 00:29:26,615
 but he, himself can not perceive. So the
others around this person perceive that

187
00:29:26,719 --> 00:29:36,792
 this person has changed. To what has
changed? This person was normal before

188
00:29:36,823 --> 00:29:47,323
and now he has become so egotistical,
he thinks that he knows everything,

189
00:29:47,427 --> 00:29:51,229
that everything he says is correct,
the only person on the earth that knows.

190
00:29:51,333 --> 00:30:04,896
'I know, I know, I'm telling you, I'm sure,
I don't even discuss anything'.

191
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:17,875
But this person was not like this before. So
the people around him detect changes in him,

192
00:30:17,979 --> 00:30:23,948
that's pathology, you have to
take it into consideration.

193
00:30:24,052 --> 00:30:32,125
And of course the observation from the physician. The physician observes

194
00:30:32,229 --> 00:30:42,458
mostly the signs, physical signs with clinical examination and the physician observes

195
00:30:42,563 --> 00:30:53,229
also certain other things which can
be on the mental, emotional level,

196
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:56,802
there is no question about that.

197
00:30:57,604 --> 00:31:08,125
So when we talk about pathology and
what is to be treated, it's these changes

198
00:31:08,229 --> 00:31:17,667
which are observed by these
3 different factors.

199
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:28,917
Now, the rest belongs to the
personality of each one of us

200
00:31:29,688 --> 00:31:32,802
who has a different personality.

201
00:31:35,604 --> 00:31:53,167
 So everyone can be jealous, egotistical,
but if you observe that this woman

202
00:31:53,271 --> 00:32:04,073
 has become crazy in her jealousy, you say,
here she is developing some pathology.

203
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:08,854
That pathology takes the form of jealousy.
Which are the remedies which have

204
00:32:08,958 --> 00:32:14,073
strong jealousy elements?

205
00:32:14,177 --> 00:32:23,490
-Hyoscyamus, Lachesis. This is the idea exactly. The whole class has to think immediately.

206
00:32:23,594 --> 00:32:29,583
The main problem of this patient is jealousy.

207
00:32:31,344 --> 00:32:39,854
More or less you shift your way of
thinking towards the remedy that has

208
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:48,688
quite this pathology that the person has.
Very sympathetic, a person is suffering a lot.

209
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:54,938
There are two remedies, Causticum, Phosphorus. Then you look at the Repertory

210
00:32:55,042 --> 00:32:59,104
there are other symptoms also, but your
thinking should come immediately

211
00:32:59,208 --> 00:33:03,479
once there is a big remedy.

212
00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:15,365
Desire for cold water, how much?
A lot of cold water. Phosphorus.

213
00:33:15,469 --> 00:33:40,281
What other remedies have strong... Bryonia, Nat-m, Sulphur. Out of these remedies,

214
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:48,354
 which is the remedy that wants cold water,
has to be cold, otherwise the water is

215
00:33:48,458 --> 00:33:55,677
like poison. Warm water for
Phosphorus is like poison.

216
00:33:55,781 --> 00:34:11,812
That is why it says when it gets warm,
he vomits it. In pneumonia case,

217
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:18,082
when they give you this information,
immediately your mind should go to Phos.
