1
00:00:18,396 --> 00:00:26,344
-The first book I wrote, they stole it.
I said, it's going to be a success.

2
00:00:26,448 --> 00:00:36,344
A woman says, my book was stolen.
 I said, ok let them read.

3
00:00:36,448 --> 00:00:43,344
-George, I would like to ask. There
was a little confusion about underlining.

4
00:00:43,448 --> 00:00:46,833
Maybe you could state this once more.

5
00:00:46,938 --> 00:00:54,521
-There was another confusion also. Karim
says that if we have a strong symptom

6
00:00:54,625 --> 00:01:10,396
like a lot of warts on the face and you see
it in the Repertory with small letters, right?

7
00:01:10,917 --> 00:01:18,313
 The symptom is very intense, you see it
in the Repertory with ordinary letters.

8
00:01:19,167 --> 00:01:33,844
This should not take you out of the possibility
of this being the remedy. With one difference:

9
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:46,094
This is there on ordinary letters because
 it was said by one prover.

10
00:01:46,198 --> 00:01:49,813
 It was recorded and we have it.

11
00:01:49,917 --> 00:02:02,323
Now we have a case in which Lyc.
was confirmed by a case, as he said.

12
00:02:02,427 --> 00:02:11,250
Then this should become italics.
Once it is confirmed then it becomes italics.

13
00:02:11,354 --> 00:02:16,833
It's very simple. If this is confirmed again
and again, then it becomes capital.

14
00:02:16,938 --> 00:02:25,271
That's the idea. There is no difference
 between what we said.

15
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:30,479
If a symptom is recorded one or two
times, then we are careful.

16
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:35,427
We see it frequently and
intensely, we raise it.

17
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:44,542
And that is why we have corrected
the Repertory. That's one thing.

18
00:02:47,427 --> 00:03:08,688
The second problem is the underlining. This
is when in the patient the symptom is clear.

19
00:03:09,427 --> 00:03:15,292
If it is especially peculiar
symptom which is clear,

20
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:24,542
you have to underline it 3 times.
 If it is a common symptom which is clear

21
00:03:24,646 --> 00:03:29,042
and intense, you have to
underline it 3 times.

22
00:03:30,885 --> 00:03:38,073
And usually you will find it in the
remedy underlined also three times.

23
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:48,583
But through this process, the
Repertory is an alive information.

24
00:03:48,688 --> 00:03:53,542
It's never going to be complete.
Nobody will write ever the total

25
00:03:53,646 --> 00:04:00,563
Materia Medica, the final Repertory.
 This is not going to happen.

26
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:02,583
 It's an alive science.

27
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,563
Some of these symptoms which
are in the Repertory today,

28
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:12,198
they will just go into
the rubbish bin.

29
00:04:13,448 --> 00:04:18,271
Some which are on small letters,
they will become italics,

30
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:28,021
and then strong, capitals.
So, is it clear now?

31
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:51,708
What I want to discuss today is a problem
which I feel the class is not clear about it.

32
00:04:53,177 --> 00:05:05,177
And since you are good students, I will try
 to give you the best possible information.

33
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:13,646
You remember this model which
 we have been talking about?

34
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:22,698
This is the best way
to depict the 3 levels.

35
00:05:22,802 --> 00:05:37,625
It is not the absolute way. The outside
which envelops the other two

36
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:46,344
is the physical body and this is the
emotional body and this is the mental body,

37
00:05:46,448 --> 00:06:02,604
which is the deepest. There is a
cooperation and a synchronization,

38
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:08,990
everything works together. The
only difference is sometimes

39
00:06:09,094 --> 00:06:18,583
 the physical body is working primarily, then
 the emotional body is primarily activated.

40
00:06:18,688 --> 00:06:24,292
Especially when you get excited because
 you saw somebody you like.

41
00:06:24,396 --> 00:06:28,990
Oh, are you here?
 There is no mind.

42
00:06:29,094 --> 00:06:34,813
The other people are looking, don't
do it like this, what they will say?

43
00:06:34,917 --> 00:06:48,708
No, no. Forget about it. Your emotions are overwhelming the whole human being.

44
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:53,833
The same thing when you sit
down there. You say to the emotions,

45
00:06:53,938 --> 00:06:58,500
you better stay cool,
 I want to understand.

46
00:06:58,604 --> 00:07:02,896
I like George, I don't like George, he is
such an egoist, he says this and that.

47
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:17,583
Quiet, quiet, let's see what he says.
Especially if your interest is attracted,

48
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:27,292
then the mental level is activated more
and more. Then it's when you learn the most.

49
00:07:33,094 --> 00:07:44,146
Now we come to people who are sick,
mentally, emotionally and physically.

50
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:52,271
Sometimes in all three levels,
in different degree in each level.

51
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:57,854
Then the first question
 we ask the patient is:

52
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:07,146
where is the seat of the problem,
in the physical body?

53
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:15,813
Why? Because his kidneys are affected, they
are breaking down. It's a big problem there.

54
00:08:15,917 --> 00:08:23,625
So, the mental-emotional will be maybe
affected but to a lesser degree.

55
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:27,208
You got somebody else,
 he comes to be treated.

56
00:08:27,313 --> 00:08:31,052
- Why have you come to be treated?
- For depression.

57
00:08:31,156 --> 00:08:33,292
- What has happened to you?
- I just want to commit suicide,

58
00:08:33,396 --> 00:08:36,323
I don't want to live.

59
00:08:36,427 --> 00:08:40,896
 And then you investigate and he says
 'I have a pain here, I have another

60
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:54,271
pain here and then sometimes my
ear aches, my teeth etc.'. These are minor.

61
00:08:54,375 --> 00:09:02,896
They go to the dustbin. You are not interested.
You're interested about depression.

62
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,875
If you give a remedy for the pains here
 and there and you miss the remedy

63
00:09:10,979 --> 00:09:19,667
which will cover the depression
element then you are missing the case.

64
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:29,896
Another one comes and says, I cannot concentrate at all. I'm finished,

65
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,938
I had a job and they dragged me out
because I could not do the job.

66
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:43,323
You are not going to say, do you feel
depressed? Of course he feels depressed.

67
00:09:45,604 --> 00:09:53,583
But the main thing, the pathology is on the mental level, it's not on emotional.

68
00:09:53,625 --> 00:10:00,938
The emotional is a consequence because
he lost his job. It's a natural thing.

69
00:10:01,042 --> 00:10:04,073
When he comes to you he will say,
'yes I'm depressed

70
00:10:04,177 --> 00:10:09,437
because I have two children and
 I cannot support them now'.

71
00:10:09,552 --> 00:10:19,708
You don't concentrate on the depression, you concentrate upon the mental deterioration.

72
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:26,750
You are supposed to know
all that very well.

73
00:10:29,865 --> 00:10:33,313
When the confusion which
 I want to clarify comes?

74
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:49,427
It comes from the fact that Kent - who is
one of our greatest Homeopaths ever lived.

75
00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:56,667
 Prescriber, teacher and irritable.

76
00:10:57,438 --> 00:11:08,667
He was a great prescriber, great
teacher and great irritability man,

77
00:11:09,688 --> 00:11:14,771
especially when you gave
the wrong answer to the theory.

78
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:18,375
He said, what? Out.

79
00:11:19,198 --> 00:11:25,135
Nobody was passing the classes if he had answered incorrectly the theory.

80
00:11:25,865 --> 00:11:32,094
 - in his theory he said that whenever
 you have a case, you give a remedy

81
00:11:32,198 --> 00:11:38,729
and there is an aggravation of the
mental, emotional level, mind,

82
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:46,323
he called it mind. And there is an amelioration
on the physical level that is a suppression.

83
00:11:46,427 --> 00:11:49,708
That means your remedy is incorrect.

84
00:11:53,594 --> 00:12:04,292
Now we come to clarify these issues
 as much as we can, at this moment.

85
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:18,625
Do you remember the other day
when we spoke about.....

86
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:33,875
and I said that every level is
structured in hierarchical way.

87
00:12:34,938 --> 00:12:42,104
So you have organs, you have the brain,
it's an organ as a whole, the heart,

88
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:52,156
the endocrine glands, the liver, the lungs, the kidneys, the bones, the muscles and the skin.

89
00:12:52,375 --> 00:13:03,979
These are organs or systems which
they are hierarchically structured

90
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:22,896
and we know that a heart ailment may,
in its way towards cure, develop -

91
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:34,979
the patient develops - arthritic pains.
We say that this is good or bad?

92
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:38,604
-Good.

93
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:45,896
-Good, if the heart problems go away
and then arthritis, severe inflammation

94
00:13:46,000 --> 00:14:00,156
on the arthroses, start, we always say, this
is a good direction, this is a curative direction.

95
00:14:00,938 --> 00:14:10,333
If the heart is affected and then you
develop spastic colitis, is it good or bad?

96
00:14:17,917 --> 00:14:26,104
In the same way, as the physical body is structured on this hierarchy level,

97
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:35,979
is the emotional body is also structured,
with systems and organs

98
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:50,604
 which deal with different emotions.
So if we go on the emotional level

99
00:14:50,865 --> 00:14:58,146
 we see that from suicidal depression,
 people just commit suicide and finish,

100
00:14:58,469 --> 00:15:06,167
we come down to apathy state, to
 indifference and then sadness

101
00:15:06,271 --> 00:15:11,385
 where people many times confuse
depression with suicidal depression,

102
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:15,271
suicidal depression is when you jump,
 finish, there is no way out of

103
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:18,760
this depression that's why you jump.

104
00:15:18,865 --> 00:15:22,646
Then sadness, then anguish, then phobias,
 then irritability, then disatisfaction.

105
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:31,604
Why I construct this out of my experience?
What I have seen in this experience?

106
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:38,625
When people came with depression
 and I gave the remedy,

107
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:46,292
I saw that once the depression went out,
 the people started living again,

108
00:15:46,396 --> 00:15:51,917
 the joy of life had come, the emotions
were activated and then

109
00:15:52,021 --> 00:15:56,094
 I noticed many times
 the fears have come.

110
00:15:56,198 --> 00:16:00,448
I'm going to die. First I want to die
when they are in depression.

111
00:16:00,917 --> 00:16:11,583
Now they are afraid that they will die.
That means the joy of life has returned.

112
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:20,052
They developed different fears many times.
They go even better by developing,

113
00:16:20,156 --> 00:16:28,677
you see irritability, anger comes
out, from depression.

114
00:16:28,781 --> 00:16:36,458
The organism what it had done before,
 it was suppressing the anger.

115
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:39,854
You wanted to say, 'you are a fool, you
 are a bastard, you have done this to me,

116
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:50,229
you have done that to me' and you could
 not because of different reasons.

117
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:55,729
The organism does not recognise
your reasons. The organism says,

118
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:04,208
 'I'm dying, I'm dying,
tell him that he was unjust'.

119
00:17:04,312 --> 00:17:11,698
'No, I can't'. The organism will push you,
do this. You say 'I cannot do this',

120
00:17:11,802 --> 00:17:20,625
and then 'I'm dying'.
One portion of emotions dies.

121
00:17:22,781 --> 00:17:35,719
 The organ which is concerned with
anger, dies. I mean it goes into collapse.

122
00:17:35,823 --> 00:17:42,740
In the same way the liver says, you
give it bad food, drinking,

123
00:17:42,844 --> 00:17:48,542
the liver works and says, 'don't give
me more' and it collapses.

124
00:17:48,646 --> 00:17:56,344
We call it liver cirrhosis. The other
organism is continuing, is going on.

125
00:17:56,448 --> 00:18:11,031
In the same way we have portions of the emotions which die, they die and they die.

126
00:18:11,135 --> 00:18:21,937
What is left? The final organ that fights
for life. It says, 'no, stay alive'.

127
00:18:22,042 --> 00:18:28,187
But all the organs, all the defences
 actually which are lower,

128
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:33,229
have broken down and
there is a life and death situation.

129
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:38,854
Life and death, life and death.
It says, death, jump, finish.

130
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:44,062
Jump from a high place and finish.

131
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:52,188
Or there is another possibility that the
organism will give to this person.

132
00:18:52,292 --> 00:18:58,010
It says 'the pain is so much I cannot
stand, I cannot remember.

133
00:18:58,115 --> 00:19:06,031
She told me to get out, you are a stupid
bambuin and all this, no, I have to die,

134
00:19:06,135 --> 00:19:11,052
 I'm nothing, I have to shoot myself'.

135
00:19:11,156 --> 00:19:19,375
And they say 'don't shoot yourself you're not stupid and then it says, forget it, forget it'.

136
00:19:20,802 --> 00:19:27,344
And the disease is transferred from
the level of the emotions

137
00:19:27,448 --> 00:19:37,729
 to mental level and there is a confusion.
 It starts a dizziness, confusion,

138
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:47,542
 I can't concentrate. And we have
transference from the emotional level

139
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:50,875
to the mental level which
 is deeper.

140
00:19:50,979 --> 00:19:58,677
Still the organism was given the
possibility to be alive but since

141
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:05,677
you did not manage to handle this
situation Mr liver, with so much wine,

142
00:20:05,781 --> 00:20:23,031
 since you did not manage, I give you
the possibility that the disease

143
00:20:23,135 --> 00:20:30,719
or the disturbance will go on a deeper
level and your whole organism

144
00:20:30,823 --> 00:20:34,875
 will stay alive with a possibility.
Maybe there is a good homeopath

145
00:20:34,979 --> 00:20:37,583
who can bring you back.

146
00:20:43,865 --> 00:20:49,979
These are the facts, this is exactly
what is happening.

147
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:58,344
Unless we understand this very
well, we're going to make

148
00:20:58,448 --> 00:21:03,542
the wrong judgment in
 evaluating a case.

149
00:21:03,646 --> 00:21:11,469
We give a remedy and the patient comes
back to us and says certain symptoms.

150
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:18,188
We have to evaluate the case and to
know exactly whether the remedy

151
00:21:18,292 --> 00:21:24,792
has acted curatively,
suppressively or not at all.

152
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:39,563
Unless we have understood this
scheme, to be able to judge correctly

153
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:42,625
 on the evaluation of your case.

154
00:21:43,823 --> 00:21:47,896
So far, is any question that
 you would like to put?

155
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,625
I want to clarify these issues,
I don't take much time.

156
00:21:57,292 --> 00:22:06,479
-I have a question to get my inner peace.
How do you see when somebody

157
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:18,677
has a lot of grief, he is depressed,
 cries a lot and you give a remedy

158
00:22:18,781 --> 00:22:26,625
 she gets quieter, she says that
 she is ok, and she doesn't cry

159
00:22:26,729 --> 00:22:33,385
anymore and she
has pain in her right shoulder.

160
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:51,896
She can't lift the arm anymore after the
remedy. She can't stand the pain and

161
00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:00,729
she does take another remedy
and she is shouting

162
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:10,760
she is screaming, getting mad.
How do you see this thing?

163
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:17,010
-Very good. I'm going to explain
exactly what is her question.

164
00:23:17,115 --> 00:23:20,688
This is exactly what I'm going to
 explain to you where in a case

165
00:23:20,792 --> 00:23:26,760
you go from the emotional to the physical
 back to the emotional, right?

166
00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:31,917
From the emotional problem to
a severe physical problem

167
00:23:32,021 --> 00:23:39,021
back to the emotional problem.
 What have you done then?

168
00:23:45,823 --> 00:23:50,385
The issue is quite complicated and
you have to be very attentive

169
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:56,042
to be able to perceive
 exactly what is happening.

170
00:23:59,052 --> 00:24:04,031
-Does this mean that the symptoms that
come back, if you treat them someone,

171
00:24:04,135 --> 00:24:11,698
let's say for depression, he gets fears,
did he have these fears before?

172
00:24:11,802 --> 00:24:15,958
Or can other symptoms arise that
he did not have before?

173
00:24:37,135 --> 00:24:55,927
This is a depression state, this is depression,
 this is forgetfulness, pains in the arms etc.

174
00:24:56,135 --> 00:25:03,094
and we had here grief when
the person went through grief.

175
00:25:03,198 --> 00:25:12,438
Now, before the grief there was a
chronic condition picture.

176
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:19,063
There were some fears, not very much.

177
00:25:20,646 --> 00:25:27,385
So this looks better than this one,
it is less disturbed.

178
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:35,031
After the grief the person was really
disturbed, here he has fear of death

179
00:25:35,135 --> 00:25:43,469
fear of thunderstorm, fear of disease,
little other fears of the dark etc.

180
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:51,063
The person lives with these fears
 without much problem,

181
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:58,625
he doesn't even go to the doctor to
treat these fears because they are

182
00:25:58,729 --> 00:26:03,323
not very disturbing. There comes the
grief and changes the whole picture

183
00:26:03,427 --> 00:26:19,021
where here we have apathy. This is the
biggest thing and then what you have to do

184
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:25,875
 is to give a remedy for this level,
 the fears etc that he had before

185
00:26:25,979 --> 00:26:31,448
or the new picture that we have
established after grief?

186
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:37,979
The correct thing is to give a
remedy that covers the grief.

187
00:26:39,802 --> 00:26:44,896
Here actually the individual who
needs several remedies

188
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,490
to proceed to a total cure,
will have several levels.

189
00:26:54,917 --> 00:27:07,667
It is like this and here most probably
is Lyc, here is Sulph and here is Calc.

190
00:27:10,271 --> 00:27:21,344
On top of this was a Nat-m. Because
the grief, the most dangerous symptom

191
00:27:21,448 --> 00:27:31,500
 was this apathy where the loss of interest in living took place, I'm not interested in living.

192
00:27:31,604 --> 00:27:38,813
I just want to die, this is a very bad
symptom, it leads to self-destruction.

193
00:27:38,917 --> 00:27:44,271
Then you give this and this second
layer will come up

194
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:48,813
and then the third layer will come up
 and the fourth layer will come up.

195
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:55,813
Sometimes the one layer mixes
a little bit with the underlying layer.

196
00:27:55,917 --> 00:28:03,385
 So here in this bottom layer you
 may have some sexual

197
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:16,292
disturbances but for the individual are not disturbances, they are normal things.

198
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:23,698
You cannot say not they are disturbances
 because you do not have

199
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:28,990
 the sensitivities of that person
and you may say that seems

200
00:28:29,094 --> 00:28:36,198
to me very normal. So these
 may lie here on the bottom.

201
00:28:38,042 --> 00:28:46,250
Underneath Calc., we have Platina
 and then you give Platina

202
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:50,552
and you get the normalization finally.

203
00:28:52,042 --> 00:28:59,188
But if you take here, the person
will not deal with this problem.

204
00:28:59,292 --> 00:29:03,146
Here he says, I'm not
even interested about sex.

205
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:10,094
Sex, under this condition?
Forget it.

206
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:20,406
Then the deep genetic predispositions
finally they will come out

207
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:26,354
and you will see this is a
Platina case now. Why?

208
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:30,438
Because the person will say, it
seems to me I have become

209
00:29:30,542 --> 00:29:33,781
from indifferent to sex, oversexed.

210
00:29:35,094 --> 00:29:41,760
-There is a question that bothers
me since our last case. I have a patient

211
00:29:41,865 --> 00:29:47,563
and he needs Nat-s. for the deepest
 suicide and depression.

212
00:29:47,667 --> 00:29:54,563
I have to give Nat-s., I suppose, and
 then how can I be sure that

213
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:58,802
the aggravation I must face,
could not kill this patient?

214
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:10,208
-As I explained, the organism knows
 what is best for the organism.

215
00:30:10,313 --> 00:30:16,990
What we do with Homeopathy,
we stimulate this defense mechanism.

216
00:30:17,094 --> 00:30:20,521
The defense mechanism does
not make mistakes.

217
00:30:20,625 --> 00:30:27,563
It is concerned about preserving the life.
That's why we say, defense mechanism.

218
00:30:27,667 --> 00:30:30,521
Defending what? Life.

219
00:30:30,625 --> 00:30:36,271
If you strengthen that, then it will
give you the best possible answer.

220
00:30:36,375 --> 00:30:41,615
So if there is a severe suicidal
depression and you give Nat-s

221
00:30:41,719 --> 00:30:50,521
and it is correct, there is no way that
this person will go to commit suicide.

222
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:58,073
If it's wrong, it's a different story.
He may by chance, commit suicide.

223
00:30:58,177 --> 00:31:05,604
That is why in 1976 Ortega
presented a case and he said

224
00:31:05,708 --> 00:31:10,292
it was a case with suicidal depression,
I gave Sulphur and the person

225
00:31:10,396 --> 00:31:19,583
committed suicide. Now this kind of talking
is irresponsible in my opinion, why?

226
00:31:20,042 --> 00:31:27,479
Because you cannot stimulate a defence mechanism which has such a wisdom

227
00:31:27,583 --> 00:31:37,052
and knows exactly what to do and the orga-
nism by chance goes to the wrong direction.

228
00:31:37,156 --> 00:31:42,990
That means Sulphur was wrong,
suicidal depression was there

229
00:31:43,094 --> 00:31:47,896
and after giving Sulphur, the person
committed suicide.

230
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,042
That means Sulphur was not
the indicated remedy.

231
00:31:54,667 --> 00:32:04,677
Now we come to the point of the original
lady who has asked about going backwards,

232
00:32:04,781 --> 00:32:13,094
to the physical body and then go back
to the mental or to the emotional.

233
00:32:13,198 --> 00:32:15,333
What is happening then?

234
00:32:20,292 --> 00:32:29,229
So I can proceed now and I take as an
example a case which suffers a lot

235
00:32:29,333 --> 00:32:44,625
on the emotional level.
This is the emotional level.

236
00:32:50,625 --> 00:32:58,479
When the disturbance is minute
and there is simple dissatisfaction,

237
00:32:58,583 --> 00:33:03,646
the emotional
problem is down there.

238
00:33:03,677 --> 00:33:13,625
When the problem is suicidal depression,
then the emotional problem is right there.

239
00:33:13,833 --> 00:33:25,917
It has destroyed the rest of the emotional
side of the person and has gone very deep.

240
00:33:33,042 --> 00:33:37,208
Then we have the mental level.

241
00:33:51,198 --> 00:33:57,813
The person thinks many many times
that 'I should end my life',

242
00:33:57,917 --> 00:34:07,813
this is suicidal depression. And at the same
time this person has some minor pains

243
00:34:07,917 --> 00:34:11,781
on the joints, physical body.

244
00:34:14,396 --> 00:34:32,708
This outside line is the skin and minor
ailment in the skin would be right down here.

245
00:34:33,729 --> 00:34:39,854
Minor ailment in the mucus
membranes will go a little bit higher.

246
00:34:39,958 --> 00:34:46,990
So the person who has suicidal
depression and some minor

247
00:34:47,094 --> 00:34:55,344
arthritic pains, I would say, he has
problem here on the physical level.

248
00:34:57,958 --> 00:35:05,156
You have to imagine that these
are corresponding lines.

249
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:15,990
One ailment which is here corresponds
 on this line, that means

250
00:35:16,094 --> 00:35:24,177
if you push this ailment on this line,
 it will go inside in this line.

251
00:35:25,979 --> 00:35:33,698
So we take on the physical level
and on the mental level he says,

252
00:35:33,802 --> 00:35:41,625
 'I have some forgetfulness'.
This is very low, absent minded.

253
00:35:41,729 --> 00:35:59,344
So we have here, emotional very deep,
physical not so deep, mental even less deep.

254
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:10,958
You give the remedy and this person
who was before depressed,

255
00:36:11,062 --> 00:36:19,667
starts now having some fears. Where are
 fears in the levels? Fears are here.

256
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:33,198
What happened with his physical pains? They became much stronger, they came up here.

257
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:42,042
What happened with the mental level?
A little bit more forgetfulness.

258
00:36:42,146 --> 00:36:52,292
So we have another triangle now and
the whole triangle is on a lower level.

259
00:36:52,667 --> 00:37:06,750
You give the second remedy because the
person complains a lot about the pains.

260
00:37:08,875 --> 00:37:18,167
You give the remedy and
suddenly the pains go away

261
00:37:18,271 --> 00:37:25,146
and a tremendous
irritability arises. Where is it?

262
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:36,354
Here, on the emotional level. So this will go
 down here, irritability will come again

263
00:37:36,458 --> 00:37:40,104
and the mental level, let us stay.

264
00:37:40,208 --> 00:37:48,396
So we have this triangle now.
So the whole issue is much lighter.

265
00:37:48,688 --> 00:37:55,510
Unfortunately this is not very clear.
I have to make a big one.

266
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:23,781
According to this scheme, when the
physical becomes dangerous for life,

267
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:32,625
with pericarditis,
 the physical is not only pains.

268
00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:38,688
It can be inflammation of the pericardium
or endocardium or an inflammation

269
00:38:38,792 --> 00:38:44,708
of the liver, or the kidneys.

270
00:38:47,448 --> 00:38:54,781
And you treat a person with
 inflammation in the kidneys.

271
00:38:54,885 --> 00:39:02,656
As the organism will be getting better
and better what you will see?

272
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:11,625
You will see coming up the genetic predispositions of the emotional level.

273
00:39:12,135 --> 00:39:17,094
 So genetically this person had some
 fears but the kidneys are broken down

274
00:39:17,198 --> 00:39:24,812
completely and the fears do not matter.
Who says now, I'm afraid to die, you're dying.

275
00:39:24,917 --> 00:39:30,917
You have no kidneys you will die.
So the fear of death has no meaning.

276
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:37,854
You treat the kidneys,
 the person gets strong,

277
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:43,958
enjoys life again, then the fear of
dying comes back.

278
00:39:44,938 --> 00:39:49,854
Then you have fears but that
which was very dangerous,

279
00:39:49,958 --> 00:39:57,250
the endocarditis it has
 become much less,

280
00:39:57,354 --> 00:40:03,823
the heart is functioning now and
now you have irritability.

281
00:40:04,094 --> 00:40:13,021
So on this level, on these correspondences,
 you will see that still the disease

282
00:40:13,125 --> 00:40:25,469
will be going down on the
scale of hierarchy.

283
00:40:37,979 --> 00:40:49,687
I want that you grasp this very well. Otherwise you cannot make an evaluation of a case.

284
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:58,542
Unless you understand that after
a severe, acute condition,

285
00:40:58,646 --> 00:41:03,479
you're treating a systemic disease,
lupus erythymatosus,

286
00:41:03,583 --> 00:41:11,990
 rheumatoid arthritis; you're
treating something serious,

287
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:16,406
then as the person
gets better on the physical body

288
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:24,562
some disturbances may appear on
the emotional level which as

289
00:41:24,667 --> 00:41:33,167
corresponding will be in minor,
in lesser, in lower level

290
00:41:33,271 --> 00:41:37,750
than the original disturbance.

291
00:41:59,833 --> 00:42:07,563
-Let's suppose that the patient took a remedy and on the emotional level came down

292
00:42:07,667 --> 00:42:13,208
but on the physical level, on the skin
 he developed a melanoma.

293
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:20,219
-What is this development? Is it good
or bad? This is the question.

294
00:42:24,688 --> 00:42:32,656
If a person, after treated correctly homeopathically for emotional problems,

295
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:41,167
develops a very severe physical disturbance,
then that means that this physical

296
00:42:41,271 --> 00:42:48,313
disturbance is of lesser damage or
importance than the emotional.

297
00:42:48,417 --> 00:42:59,844
That means that this person was crazy.
If we have disturbances which are really

298
00:43:02,833 --> 00:43:10,271
mental-emotional deep disturbances,
to see their corresponding

299
00:43:10,375 --> 00:43:21,958
physical equal, it might be quite strong,
 quite terrifying sometimes.

300
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:29,990
As the lady described it, so much pain,
she cries and she can't stand the lumbago,

301
00:43:30,094 --> 00:43:31,583
these are still nothing.

302
00:43:32,396 --> 00:43:41,896
But if you have something like melanoma,
even in such a case I have found out that

303
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:50,427
if this organism is shifted to this direction,
there is a possibility for a cure.

304
00:43:50,583 --> 00:43:54,031
Most of the times, the next
remedy will be apparent

305
00:43:54,135 --> 00:43:59,354
and then you will be able
to help further the individual.

306
00:44:00,427 --> 00:44:08,115
Now, there is a possibility that all this development is accidental

307
00:44:08,219 --> 00:44:13,427
which is of a different thing.

308
00:44:16,313 --> 00:44:26,938
- There are 2 levels, very deeply
affected. Heart ailment- strong,

309
00:44:27,042 --> 00:44:36,563
and on the other side suicidal
depression or destructive delirium.

310
00:44:36,667 --> 00:44:44,250
Where do I have to put the
stress of the treatment?

311
00:44:47,865 --> 00:44:56,875
-In such a case it will be very difficult to find the remedy. The remedy will not be apparent.

312
00:44:57,271 --> 00:45:06,781
In so progressed cases in pathology
we cannot see the remedy.

313
00:45:06,885 --> 00:45:13,427
So there is no a question where you put
the stress of the treatment.

314
00:45:13,531 --> 00:45:23,229
You don't see the remedy. You just see all possibilities there without a specific remedy

315
00:45:23,333 --> 00:45:28,667
 which you're searching for. In such a
case you will not find the remedy.

316
00:45:33,083 --> 00:45:39,760
-We always have to put the question,
how long may last such a process?

317
00:45:39,865 --> 00:45:44,021
How long it may last until
we can come to cure?

318
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:55,104
-That's a good question. The deeper you
start here, the longer it will take.

319
00:45:56,875 --> 00:46:05,094
 If you start with the physical, even
severe, but the mental-emotional

320
00:46:05,198 --> 00:46:14,323
 disturbances are minute, then the
length of time that you need

321
00:46:14,427 --> 00:46:22,656
to bring about a cure, will be much
 less than if you are treating a mental case

322
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:33,094
 of a deep disorder. It will take much
longer with the mental-emotional.

323
00:46:35,979 --> 00:46:43,406
-In the case of depression that evolved into melanoma, once you have the melanoma,

324
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:50,292
do you think it is wise to treat it surgically or should we treat it with a second remedy?

325
00:46:50,781 --> 00:46:56,344
-Especially with melanoma, it's not only
what you would like to do,

326
00:46:56,448 --> 00:47:05,021
it is what society likes you to do. Society in general and I mean the medical society,

327
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:12,833
 demands that you treat it surgically.
So what you have to do is to treat

328
00:47:12,938 --> 00:47:21,938
it surgically so you don't have the attorney inquiring and then you continue to treat

329
00:47:22,042 --> 00:47:28,479
 according to the symptomatology
with the hope that it's not going to be

330
00:47:28,583 --> 00:47:34,958
 a metastasis
or a relapse of the melanoma.

331
00:47:42,448 --> 00:47:51,396
-If I have a patient with a lot of
aggression and I gave him a remedy,

332
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:55,646
then he gets a big heart problem.

333
00:47:55,750 --> 00:48:01,917
Is it possible that he can get a heart attack
or I don't know how to react in this?

334
00:48:02,021 --> 00:48:17,031
-It's a heart problem, yes. Developing
 from fears, strong anxiety neurosis

335
00:48:17,135 --> 00:48:21,802
the heart
can maybe affected, yes.

336
00:48:26,208 --> 00:48:32,385
-I wish to ask you about this
case with the melanoma.

337
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:43,052
I heard and I read about melanoma.
Before all of them medical doctors thought

338
00:48:43,156 --> 00:48:53,188
that melanoma is very very aggressive,
one of the mosts aggressive cancers

339
00:48:53,292 --> 00:48:57,271
but after a while saw that many patients

340
00:48:57,375 --> 00:49:09,010
have melanoma since 20 or 30 years.
Now I think that this development

341
00:49:09,115 --> 00:49:13,760
you can see after the operation,
 this aggressivity.

342
00:49:13,865 --> 00:49:23,167
And I think to let operate it will
be an explosion in the body

343
00:49:23,271 --> 00:49:28,188
and it will be very difficult to manage.

344
00:49:28,292 --> 00:49:32,073
-That is true, sometimes after an
operation with melanoma

345
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:35,385
we have the explosion and
we have the metastasis.

346
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:39,563
It is true in some cases. It is true also
that in some cases of melanoma

347
00:49:39,667 --> 00:49:43,719
it might stay for a long period of
time without progress.

348
00:49:43,823 --> 00:49:51,438
So there are different types of
melanoma and different individuals,

349
00:49:51,542 --> 00:49:54,719
depending on their defences,
how they can handle

350
00:49:54,823 --> 00:49:57,542
 and they can bring about, balance.

351
00:49:57,646 --> 00:50:08,104
That is true but what we say is that in case
you allow your patient to be operated,

352
00:50:08,208 --> 00:50:13,052
 by giving the homeopathic
remedy, you protect him

353
00:50:13,156 --> 00:50:16,958
from going into metastasis state.

354
00:50:24,729 --> 00:50:28,677
-If someone has a depression and then
gets a melanoma which I assume

355
00:50:28,781 --> 00:50:33,958
in this case that it is  more severe,
on higher level than the depression itself ?

356
00:50:34,063 --> 00:50:44,146
-No, no. It is on physical level but if you
take this, suicidal depression is almost

357
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:50,344
 in the end of life of the physical body.

358
00:50:50,448 --> 00:50:58,292
The melanoma is somewhere here,
depression is there. It's going down there.

359
00:50:59,583 --> 00:51:05,938
You remember also that in this model
we have the uppermost parts

360
00:51:09,375 --> 00:51:13,688
 of the mental-emotional outside
 of the physical body.

361
00:51:13,917 --> 00:51:18,260
You remember that we have given the explanation. Why this is so?

362
00:51:18,333 --> 00:51:28,448
There are some functions of the human
being which transcend his physical body.

363
00:51:28,552 --> 00:51:33,167
These functions are absolutely essential
for the human being to exist

364
00:51:33,271 --> 00:51:42,094
 as a human being and therefore
are beyond the physical body.

365
00:51:47,042 --> 00:51:58,427
-I have a question concerning age. When
you treat a baby or an elderly person

366
00:51:58,531 --> 00:52:04,094
with heart problems or so.
Is something to consider in this case?

367
00:52:05,646 --> 00:52:11,625
-I don't understand the question.

368
00:52:16,198 --> 00:52:22,094
-Just with age if there is a difference with the treatment, if you have something to consider.

369
00:52:22,198 --> 00:52:26,406
If there is something with an elderly
person, being more dangerous

370
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:30,427
and with a baby also or a small child?

371
00:52:31,865 --> 00:52:39,958
-No, I think it's gonna happen both. I do not
have the experience treating babies

372
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:48,646
with AIDS but theoretically
 we could say that...

373
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:56,531
-Not AIDS, age !

374
00:52:56,542 --> 00:52:59,708
-Age?

375
00:53:00,292 --> 00:53:11,042
-George, the question is about
the age of the patient.

376
00:53:12,625 --> 00:53:15,396
-I will tell you something, whilst I'm
 teaching you Homeopathy,

377
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:22,938
I'm teaching you English
also. It's a joke.

378
00:53:23,958 --> 00:53:30,094
Actually it's not a joke, a lot of people
have learned, I see them year after year

379
00:53:30,198 --> 00:53:35,917
understanding better English
because my English is so clear.

380
00:53:57,552 --> 00:54:04,406
-Is it a difference between treating a
baby and treating a grown up?

381
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:06,719
No there is no difference.

382
00:54:06,823 --> 00:54:18,146
Treating the baby only is more easy than
 treating the grown up. Why?

383
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:27,521
Because their defence mechanisms are
 not destroyed through stresses of life.

384
00:54:27,625 --> 00:54:31,708
They have not time to fall in love
and then get disappointed,

385
00:54:32,333 --> 00:54:39,427
they don't have time to become
alcoholics, you know all these.

386
00:54:39,531 --> 00:54:48,031
These are stresses that are
weakening the human body.
