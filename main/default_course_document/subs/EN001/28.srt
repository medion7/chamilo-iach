1
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:28,844
-What about the people who are not
practising in a medical profession,

2
00:00:28,948 --> 00:00:32,562
who are not working in a medical profession?

3
00:00:32,667 --> 00:00:35,115
They do not have permission
to practice in Germany.

4
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:40,313
So that means I'm not allowed
to have patients.

5
00:00:40,417 --> 00:00:45,271
-That's a problem. When you don't
have the permission to practice,

6
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:57,063
you are not going for the diploma, so
therefore you are not obliged to send papers.

7
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:05,354
But let us say eventually you go to
chiropractic, you get permission,

8
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:11,448
 if you have done in the meantime,
 you can have it.

9
00:01:11,552 --> 00:01:18,375
Maybe you don't have it now but you are
going to have the permission in 3 years,

10
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,104
by the time you finish the course.

11
00:01:20,208 --> 00:01:30,667
So if that is your objective then you will have to follow the rules of the class for the diploma.

12
00:01:34,042 --> 00:01:40,448
-To this question I wish to ask something
else. Vassilis said that sometimes

13
00:01:40,552 --> 00:01:53,438
he gives instead of placebo, he gives
 salts in a small potency D6.

14
00:01:53,542 --> 00:02:01,552
I couldn't understand why he doesn't give placebo and he gives Homeopathic

15
00:02:01,656 --> 00:02:12,458
remedies which have nothing to do with
a similar remedy. Can you explain that?

16
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:23,250
- Do you know the 12 Schuessler's salts?
 Who knows them? Ok.

17
00:02:27,885 --> 00:02:37,750
There are 12 salts that are
called Schuessler's salts.

18
00:03:31,573 --> 00:03:36,094
Now these salts are salts which
 the body needs, they are

19
00:03:36,198 --> 00:03:47,094
in this composition circulating within
the body. They are almost like food.

20
00:03:47,198 --> 00:04:16,781
 They are diluted in this dilution 1/10 to the 6th.
 In this dilution is like giving extra vitamins

21
00:04:16,885 --> 00:04:31,000
or a little bit of these salts. So whether you
give or not give it, it makes no difference.

22
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:45,979
In Greece, they prescribe always the high potency one remedy and then the placebo.

23
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:51,469
 Instead of the placebo you give this,
for what? For reasons that in case

24
00:04:51,573 --> 00:04:58,417
there is an investigation they see
that this is a little something.

25
00:04:58,521 --> 00:05:05,687
But this little something cannot
do any harm especially

26
00:05:05,792 --> 00:05:13,896
 if it's given in a dilution
which the organism absorbs.

27
00:05:15,885 --> 00:05:21,073
 The organism absorbs this, brings
 it to this dilution and then uses it.

28
00:05:21,177 --> 00:05:29,000
So you give it prepared,
one little tablet, no problem.

29
00:05:39,927 --> 00:05:51,250
-There was a difference between dilute Schuessler's salts and to potentise.

30
00:05:51,354 --> 00:05:57,781
Because Schuessler's salts is just
 diluted and not potentised.

31
00:05:57,885 --> 00:06:05,583
-It's better not to be potentised.
We just dilute it.

32
00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:16,667
-What you said about XM, 3 times, I think
 for beginners it might be dangerous.

33
00:06:16,771 --> 00:06:22,813
To say once more that nothing to be repeated
 if there is any change in any direction.

34
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:34,604
-10M ok. I said in cases where you have a
lot of remedies given, 20-30 remedies,

35
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:40,760
you give one 10M, next day there
is no reaction. You can give a second

36
00:06:40,865 --> 00:06:47,156
and you can give a third. Only in those
cases where the patient has taken

37
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:55,292
 a lot of remedies you can do that.
And he does not react.

38
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:04,260
If he reacts the first day, stop.
If he reacts the second day, stop.

39
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:11,375
 If he doesn't react at all,
 find another remedy.

40
00:07:18,573 --> 00:07:29,229
Having studied a case and having satisfied yourself that this is the remedy,

41
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:36,885
you don't go  and change it,
like the Romanian girl.

42
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:46,333
I satisfied my knowledge that
this is not a Nat-m case, it's a Sepia.

43
00:07:46,438 --> 00:07:57,760
So with Sepia I will be patient and
I will wait. I will not wait, I said, take Nat-m.

44
00:07:57,865 --> 00:08:10,073
No, I made the mistake. But if I see
it's a mistake, then you don't wait.

45
00:08:10,177 --> 00:08:15,240
Why you should wait,
it will not be different.

46
00:08:16,281 --> 00:08:23,531
 If it is a mistake, at the most it's going
to change some here and there.

47
00:08:23,635 --> 00:08:30,000
In any case Sepia will be indicated and
 I will give her Sepia in any case.

48
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:53,604
- I would like to put a question about
some allopathic treatment.

49
00:08:53,708 --> 00:09:02,448
It's said if people have coronary heart
disease to give aspirin daily once a day

50
00:09:02,552 --> 00:09:14,844
very low, just to prevent any heart attack.
Is this a suppression or would you agree

51
00:09:14,948 --> 00:09:22,510
to do it next to the Homeopathic
 treatment?  Very low dose.

52
00:09:23,302 --> 00:09:28,667
-I feel that you can do it. I have
found out that aspirin does not

53
00:09:28,771 --> 00:09:34,063
very much interfere with the
Homeopathic remedy.

54
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:40,750
We have used it freely all these
years without much interference.

55
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:56,604
-I would like to ask about Homeopathic
remedies that we get from Austria

56
00:09:56,708 --> 00:10:05,958
and Germany and they bring them here.
So, from what I heard these remedies

57
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:12,771
when they went through X-rays at the
airport, they might lose their efficiency.

58
00:10:13,188 --> 00:10:15,531
 What do you think?

59
00:10:15,635 --> 00:10:21,844
In my experience, as far as I can
remember, it has not affected them.

60
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:31,646
-I didn't want to pass it and then the lady said,
 'oh when you are going into the airplane

61
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:39,635
there is much more X-ray'.
So it doesn't change anything.

62
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:15,021
-George, she asked you about aspirin.
I think there is a difference between

63
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:29,604
high quantity of aspirin to treat, for
example chronic arthritis or headache

64
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:34,250
where the people
are taking maybe 10.

65
00:11:34,354 --> 00:11:43,156
-Even so. For instance in rheumotoid
arthritis where the orthodox treatment,

66
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:52,854
is 12 aspirins the day. In severe cases
 they prescribe 12 aspirins a day.

67
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:57,885
 Even in such cases, I've seen the
Homeopathic remedy works.

68
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:01,813
That's why I said, I'm not afraid of aspirin.

69
00:12:02,573 --> 00:12:07,604
-May I make a remark on the question
because of the X-ray check?

70
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:14,198
-I have a patient who did very well with
a Q potency and she took it with her-

71
00:12:14,302 --> 00:12:22,865
she told me 6 years ago- and she
said from the moment she came

72
00:12:22,969 --> 00:12:29,927
 to the other country, no more
effect of the Q potency.

73
00:12:31,354 --> 00:12:35,844
-That's something that we have to
check. This is the first time I hear that

74
00:12:35,948 --> 00:12:44,740
and I want to check it. It's a very
serious issue if it is like this.

75
00:12:44,844 --> 00:12:51,865
-I usually wrap the remedies with foil
and put them in the suitcase, no problem.

76
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:56,083
The X-rays don't go through
the aluminum foil.

77
00:12:57,125 --> 00:13:04,625
-This is the first time I hear that
and it's better we be careful.

78
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:14,688
-About remedies. Is it a firm, some
producers that you prefer?

79
00:13:14,792 --> 00:13:19,375
A producer of Homeopathic
 remedies that you prefer?

80
00:13:19,479 --> 00:13:24,979
-You see, I would prefer to make
the remedies myself.

81
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:29,354
I don't trust actually anybody.

82
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:40,604
If you say, you're going to make
50.000 times, emptying, filling, hit,

83
00:13:44,021 --> 00:13:51,406
who is going to count.
Try to count 50.000, 1,2,3 just this.

84
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:57,740
So I had a problem myself,
what are we giving?

85
00:13:57,844 --> 00:14:02,521
When we say 50M what
 actually we are giving?

86
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:12,448
Then, years ago, I tried to find some
 company that will make remedies

87
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:26,958
by a robot that imitated the hand
 movement because that,

88
00:14:27,063 --> 00:14:30,313
for me was also important
 to have the original.

89
00:14:30,417 --> 00:14:38,229
But at the same time because we went so
high, Hahnemann went up to 6X up to 30,

90
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:44,979
one time he gave 60, it was terrible,
too high. Now we are going 10.000, 50.000.

91
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:53,177
 It's not any human being that can hit, empty
and fill 50.000 times, I don't believe it.

92
00:14:53,281 --> 00:15:00,802
So I went to the different companies and
 I said, I would like to give you my idea

93
00:15:00,906 --> 00:15:06,094
and what you should do for
 producing this remedy.

94
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:11,740
What do we need to do? You need to
make a robot to imitate etc. etc.

95
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:15,917
How much medicine we will sell?
I don't know how much.

96
00:15:16,021 --> 00:15:22,406
You give one dose to your patients.

97
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:29,198
How many students do you have? They calculated, no it's too expensive, forget it.

98
00:15:29,302 --> 00:15:39,427
I went to different ones and one company said, we are interested. We'll make these robots.

99
00:15:39,531 --> 00:15:47,333
This company was making dialysis
machines. They had all the technology,

100
00:15:47,438 --> 00:15:55,542
it was a huge company in Italy; they
said we go into Homeopathy also.

101
00:15:56,667 --> 00:16:02,375
The factory is a huge
thing like half of Alonissos.

102
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:07,781
They said, ok little factory like that,
why not?  So what do you need?

103
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:16,469
I need an engineer, a chemist,
this, that. They produced the team,

104
00:16:16,573 --> 00:16:20,354
I explained to them what
I wanted and they did it.

105
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:28,604
They did a machine who imitates
this movement, the hit.

106
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:48,802
This company is called SIFRA from Italy.
That computer now can be programmed.

107
00:16:48,906 --> 00:17:06,042
 You say, I want number 12, 30, 200,
 1M, 10M, 50M and 100M.

108
00:17:06,146 --> 00:17:16,135
So the machine starts and when it
 reaches 12, it puts it aside.

109
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,292
 It reaches 30 and then puts it aside etc. etc.

110
00:17:20,396 --> 00:17:30,292
There is no interference with the human
mind, it's automatic and I said, ok.

111
00:17:30,396 --> 00:17:42,885
But still I would like to do it here, to see it
with my eyes that this is done properly.

112
00:17:43,615 --> 00:17:58,917
I can tell you, they helped, they did it
but still I would like to do it here.

113
00:17:59,021 --> 00:18:10,354
I would like to be 100 % sure and this
is only if I do it next door, here.

114
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:16,448
If I had a laboratory, then I could
 tell you this is 10M,

115
00:18:16,552 --> 00:18:24,469
this is 50M, so when you give 50M
you know that it is really 50M.

116
00:18:24,573 --> 00:18:32,563
Now how can I know? And of course
they produced this by the robots

117
00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:38,250
that they were working day and
 night, they don't stop.

118
00:18:38,354 --> 00:18:47,198
You program the machine and it goes
 for days until it makes a remedy.

119
00:18:47,302 --> 00:18:50,406
 It is 3 or 4 years that they
have started,

120
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:57,333
still they have not completed a full
series of medications.

121
00:18:57,438 --> 00:19:02,375
Because it takes time, and they
produced 3 of such robots.

122
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:11,083
The human being is producing by hand.

123
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:22,000
I tried to make by hand myself. I potentised- some ideas which I had in the beginning-

124
00:19:22,104 --> 00:19:28,156
and I saw how difficult it is. It's not easy.

125
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:38,417
You try to do it and you see how you feel
after 1 hour. You want massage.

126
00:19:43,885 --> 00:19:52,219
This company it's a company which
I have done; I use this medicine of course.

127
00:19:54,792 --> 00:20:00,438
Because I know, at least,
 the system, how it works.

128
00:20:10,438 --> 00:20:16,625
-With which potency do you start?
 If you discover that the remedy is,

129
00:20:16,729 --> 00:20:23,896
 for instance, Calc for a child with
which potency do you start?

130
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,979
-In a child?

131
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:39,417
You remember when
I made this model for you?

132
00:20:42,885 --> 00:20:47,229
  I showed you in the lowest parts
here, the lower you go, the more the

133
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:51,563
the more the pathology here
the lower the remedy.

134
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:59,104
 It doesn't matter whether here you have a
child or a grown up person who is ill.

135
00:20:59,208 --> 00:21:05,208
Still the pathology is severe
therefore the potency is low.

136
00:21:05,313 --> 00:21:15,531
What do I mean by low potency?
Low potency is from 6X up to 12X or 12C.

137
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:34,177
A medium is C200-C30 and a high
potency is from this up and the highest

138
00:21:34,281 --> 00:21:37,104
potency is 50M to CM.

139
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:54,885
 So it's C200-C30,
then 1M-10M, then 50M-CM.

140
00:22:00,354 --> 00:22:09,354
But these are indications. Experience
 eventually will show you and you'll say,

141
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:12,406
oh I can go higher or I cannot go higher.

142
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:18,115
 They make the remedies in the
Hahnemann Clinic in N.Berkley

143
00:22:18,219 --> 00:22:20,521
- Michael Quin- they
have this machine....

144
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:36,135
This machine does these movements up
and down. When Michael made this I said,

145
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:44,240
 I want this. And then he produced the
machine. I said, no this is not correct.

146
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,271
This is not what I want. Well he says,
we made it now, we cannot change it.

147
00:22:52,479 --> 00:22:59,844
What I'm talking about now is, this machine
is much more sophisticated, a whole robot.

148
00:22:59,948 --> 00:23:10,510
 It does like that.
Hahnemann did not do that.

149
00:23:10,615 --> 00:23:12,604
He did like this, you see?

150
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:20,135
We found out through research
that we have clusters formed.

151
00:23:23,615 --> 00:23:31,313
And as is the bottle here, they found
 out from physics, not from us

152
00:23:32,573 --> 00:23:45,667
that when you break down the molecules,
the molecules are forming little clusters like this.

153
00:23:49,302 --> 00:24:00,646
These clusters, if they are given
some time, they tend to stick

154
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:09,000
to the sides of the bottle by gravity.
They gravitate towards the sides.

155
00:24:09,104 --> 00:24:17,729
 So you have to give them some time
 to rearrange themselves.....

156
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:25,125
You are doing something but
 not the original potentisation.

157
00:24:29,042 --> 00:24:42,104
 Some dentists, they have the amalgam machine. Very fast and very short.

158
00:24:43,146 --> 00:24:51,531
Another one is doing like this.
So there was no standardization.

159
00:24:52,063 --> 00:25:01,958
So I said, where are we going? We fight in finding the remedy and then we get a remedy

160
00:25:02,063 --> 00:25:06,979
which is not a remedy, it's not
what we expect it to be.

161
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:16,271
So I tried to standardize that portion as well,
 so if one company does it and the other

162
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:24,667
companies are threatened, then they will have
to imitate that company that was the idea.

163
00:25:24,771 --> 00:25:34,000
Of course these Sifra people, they don't really care because this is a small business

164
00:25:34,104 --> 00:25:42,542
 and in their huge entertainment, that's
nothing.They did not threaten,

165
00:25:42,646 --> 00:25:54,271
at least not yet, the other companies
who continue to make their own ways.

166
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:59,375
But if you really go and see how they
potentise, you will see the machines

167
00:25:59,479 --> 00:26:06,333
going up and down,
like this, and very fast.

168
00:26:06,438 --> 00:26:16,479
I did not want that fast;
that's how the remedies

169
00:26:16,583 --> 00:26:20,510
were originally produced, by hand.

170
00:26:22,542 --> 00:26:27,510
So what else can I do?
 I try to fight all fronts.

171
00:26:34,458 --> 00:26:41,375
You see if all Homeopaths suddenly
decide to buy from Sifra, the others of course,

172
00:26:41,479 --> 00:26:48,938
next day they will make the investment
and they will make equal machines.

173
00:26:49,042 --> 00:26:59,771
It is a matter of investing some money to
do it properly. They make such big profits.

174
00:27:00,813 --> 00:27:03,521
Where are these profits are going? Why
don't you invest again to do it properly?
