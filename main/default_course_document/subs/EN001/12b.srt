1
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:27,625
I have said and this was a
question that you had to answer,

2
00:00:27,729 --> 00:00:33,062
what was the difference between the
 explanation I was giving for the

3
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:37,260
action of the remedy and what
was the difference with Hahnemann?

4
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:57,354
Hahnemann's explanation, is that the remedy is stronger and overpowers the disease and takes

5
00:00:57,458 --> 00:01:09,281
it out and runs its course, the remedy runs its course. This is the explanation of Hahnemann.

6
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:23,740
And I had explained to you that this, according
 to my understanding, is wrong perception.

7
00:01:23,844 --> 00:01:33,354
Even Hahnemann himself says, you are not to
be interested how the remedy works but anyhow

8
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:37,073
if you are interested, I will give
you my opinion, this is my opinion.

9
00:01:37,177 --> 00:01:41,271
This is what he says in this paragraph.

10
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:49,688
According to my explanation, the
reason why the remedy acts is this:

11
00:01:49,792 --> 00:01:59,792
the organism under stimulation
develops certain symptoms.

12
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:13,896
It has big and small symptoms. That means
the symptoms are the means through which

13
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,604
the organism tries to find its
balance. Otherwise it will die.

14
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:24,938
Here stimulation is streptococcus,
bacteria, virus or whatever.

15
00:02:25,042 --> 00:02:37,177
The organism raises the temperature, brings mucus brings cough, etc. to fight the disease.

16
00:02:37,281 --> 00:02:48,667
Through the symptoms is fighting the
disease, the cause. Do you understand this?

17
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:07,135
The idea is that every symptom that the organism is giving out is in order to keep

18
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:19,583
a kind of a balance. What would
happen if there were no reaction

19
00:03:19,688 --> 00:03:29,865
 of the organism if the
bacteria were multiplying?

20
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:38,354
The bacteria may come to the organism or
the organism itself has the bacteria actually

21
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:47,667
and the bacteria under certain circumstances
they start growing 50.000, 100.000, 1million

22
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:53,979
 1.5 million then the organism is
triggered. It says, danger.

23
00:03:54,083 --> 00:04:03,469
What it does? It raises a fever. If it did
not do that you can imagine the bacteria

24
00:04:03,573 --> 00:04:08,333
are overwhelming the organism and
one time without any reason you

25
00:04:08,438 --> 00:04:17,375
 would see the organism collapse and die.
This happens actually in certain diseases in

26
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:27,729
 which bacteria explode very quickly and
you see the death within a few hours.

27
00:04:28,219 --> 00:04:37,198
So therefore the symptoms are the means through which the organism itself says,

28
00:04:37,302 --> 00:04:41,958
let me do this, let me do that, symptoms, symptoms to keep my balance,

29
00:04:42,063 --> 00:04:54,292
give me water, electrolytes are high,
give me less water, give me sweets etc.

30
00:04:54,396 --> 00:04:59,979
All these are symptoms to fight disease.

31
00:05:06,531 --> 00:05:17,167
 The organism has a way of
reacting towards the stimulus.

32
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:22,292
And this is the best way.
 There is no other way.

33
00:05:22,396 --> 00:05:31,562
The organism decides this is my best way.
 We see what the organism is doing

34
00:05:31,667 --> 00:05:41,583
and we say, ok let's take that
remedy which produces similar symptoms.

35
00:05:41,969 --> 00:05:51,844
What we do? We help this reaction.
That means by giving in this organism,

36
00:05:51,948 --> 00:06:09,563
the similar remedy, the similimum, we are
again exciting the organism towards

37
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:16,302
 the same direction in which it
tries to fight the disease.

38
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:28,781
You give a remedy that has the same picture,
 this picture but no so strong of course.

39
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:34,635
Something like that. The remedy
has a picture like this.

40
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,229
The remedy has more symptoms also.

41
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:46,531
But the general pattern it
fits in the main symptoms.

42
00:06:46,635 --> 00:06:54,344
That means you stimulate the defence
 of the organism in the same direction

43
00:06:54,448 --> 00:07:03,271
as the organism has decided to
fight the disease. You don't go against.

44
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:26,906
If you fight one main symptom, ex. this is fever and you give a local treatment you suppress this.

45
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:36,396
Then by suppressing this, fever comes here
and then this symptom becomes like this.

46
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:41,083
Then the organism is trying
 to find a new balance.

47
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:55,625
We try to find exactly the similar remedy which will stimulate in the same way the organism.

48
00:07:56,771 --> 00:08:05,563
What we do? We strengthen the
 defenses of the organism.

49
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:16,229
 That is why initially we see an aggravation
 of the symptoms because the organism

50
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:23,865
is trying this way, it says, raise a
little bit fever, just a little bit more.

51
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:30,469
It cannot and the fever comes up and down,
 up and down, it continues, continues, why?

52
00:08:30,573 --> 00:08:38,375
The organism cannot raise it
enough to burn the cause, the bacteria.

53
00:08:38,396 --> 00:08:45,563
You will give the remedy and the fever shoots
 up just enough to burn the bacteria;

54
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:51,781
maybe it is a fraction of a degree but
that is  enough for the organism

55
00:08:51,885 --> 00:09:02,604
to overwhelm the cause. So what we
do here is to stimulate the defence

56
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:11,490
 mechanism in the same way the
organism itself is fighting disease.

57
00:09:11,594 --> 00:09:23,594
That is why we have initial aggravation
and that is why the effect is curative.

58
00:09:23,635 --> 00:09:28,896
Otherwise, suppressing this symptom, no curative effect, suppressing that symptom,

59
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:37,865
 no curative effect. Suppressing 1,2,3 and leaving out that symptom, no curative effect.

60
00:09:37,969 --> 00:09:44,479
That is why we say the allopathic
way of thinking which says,

61
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:51,937
the most dangerous thing for the
 child is the fever, bring down the fever,

62
00:09:52,333 --> 00:10:04,437
 but then you make the
child crazy. What is this?

63
00:10:05,177 --> 00:10:10,740
Because you brought down the fever.
Because you acted only in one

64
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:21,021
part of the defence mechanism. So here
by trying to find the similar remedy,

65
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:29,688
 we stimulate the organism, we give the extra energy that he needs and then we see

66
00:10:29,792 --> 00:10:43,583
the balancing as a result; we have the
balancing of that situation, back to normal.

67
00:10:45,917 --> 00:11:02,563
Is this clear? This is very important that
you understand this. A lot of questions.

68
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:11,563
-I have a question regarding suppression
with the remedy which is not very similar

69
00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:22,667
and the other theory being that you can give
several remedies that are partially similar,

70
00:11:22,771 --> 00:11:29,958
 that's reaching a cure all together; if you
cannot find the correct or if it doesn't exist.

71
00:11:30,667 --> 00:11:39,854
-It is possible instead of hiting
the exact remedy to hit a remedy

72
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:44,667
which is similar and then you see
 a change in the pattern.

73
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:49,000
Then you take the change in the
 pattern and then you prescribe

74
00:11:49,104 --> 00:11:52,938
the second remedy
 and then you proceed.

75
00:11:53,042 --> 00:12:00,073
And then you give a 3rd, a 4th or
a 5th remedy in a case where

76
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:07,313
maybe 1 or 2 remedies would be
enough to bring about the cure.

77
00:12:07,417 --> 00:12:14,042
It is true by changing the pattern
all the time, finally you accomplish a cure

78
00:12:14,146 --> 00:12:21,240
but never a complete cure as it
comes with the right similimum.

79
00:12:23,302 --> 00:12:33,427
 Something always is left to be desired
but this is something which most

80
00:12:33,531 --> 00:12:38,010
Homeopaths are doing due to the lack of
complete knowledge of the Materia Medica

81
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,302
 and lack of knowledge of the Theory.

82
00:12:45,271 --> 00:12:54,510
Many times we follow this path,
that remedy, that remedy.

83
00:12:55,792 --> 00:13:05,229
These are the cases mostly which
are one-sided, what Hahnemann calls,

84
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:10,406
especially the mental diseases
Hahnemann calls, one-sided.

85
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:19,271
That means only the mental is affected.
 He considers them very difficult to cure,

86
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:28,240
he says one-sided give a remedy and
then wait to see the next picture.

87
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:44,271
She says, I find it difficult to
understand when the organism

88
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:57,469
is giving out dangerous
symptoms like epileptic fit?

89
00:13:57,573 --> 00:14:06,135
That's a good question.
These are the questions I'm expecting.

90
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:19,448
What happens, is an epileptic fit an
effort of the organism to cure itself?

91
00:14:19,552 --> 00:14:29,177
And the answer is yes. Why? Because
if this epileptic fit does not take place,

92
00:14:29,281 --> 00:14:40,354
 then the organism is in danger of
 having damage on a deeper level.

93
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:53,333
For instance, the focus of an epileptic
 fit is somewhere in the brain.

94
00:14:53,438 --> 00:14:58,115
That means there is a damage
there, whether is electrical

95
00:14:58,219 --> 00:15:12,688
chemical, whatever. If you close this,
then the organism does not cure itself,

96
00:15:12,792 --> 00:15:20,115
if you go and stop the fit. It takes the
disturbance deeper into the organism.

97
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:34,333
So you see with the epileptics that once you
stop, force it the rest of the organism on

98
00:15:34,438 --> 00:15:43,625
the mental-emotional level becomes disturbed. So the people who take the anti-epileptic drugs

99
00:15:43,729 --> 00:15:52,406
are people drugged, they have lost
the ability to think clearly, to feel clearly,

100
00:15:52,510 --> 00:16:00,240
 they develop different other perversions.
Which means that the epileptic fit has gone

101
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:10,563
deeper now into the organism and created other disturbances in the organism, deeper than the fit.

102
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:12,448
That's number one.

103
00:16:12,552 --> 00:16:28,250
The second is that you could say, there is a difference between an accident and a disease.

104
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:48,021
Epileptic fit is a disease, it's not an accident.
But you could say, what about a heart infarct?

105
00:16:53,552 --> 00:17:06,667
In the heart infarct, does this
organism need it in order to cure itself?

106
00:17:06,771 --> 00:17:08,354
 Of course not.

107
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:21,844
But in this case it is an accident, it is a piece
of clot which circulates in the organism

108
00:17:21,948 --> 00:17:27,458
and goes and closes an artery suddenly
and then you have a heart infarct.

109
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:38,229
 This is an accident which you cannot prevent. Once the accident has taken place,

110
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:45,417
then you can say Arnica, Rhus-t, Lyc, Bry because it gives out symptoms of course.

111
00:17:45,573 --> 00:17:49,604
Every accident that happens to
the organism has a reaction.

112
00:17:52,083 --> 00:18:01,198
But don't stick yourself to these
few things which may be

113
00:18:01,302 --> 00:18:10,094
happening and we put them
on the idea of an accident.

114
00:18:10,198 --> 00:18:20,510
The same way, as he said yesterday, he had swallowed something, is it possible that an

115
00:18:20,615 --> 00:18:29,646
accident would have taken place and
would have created inflammation etc?

116
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:33,563
And in these cases we have the
remedies according to the symptoms

117
00:18:33,667 --> 00:18:37,375
which will help the accident.

118
00:18:38,458 --> 00:19:09,438
-Hahnemann says that the life force reacts without any sense to save the organism

119
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:15,917
but which may lead to death.
I want to know whether you think is a

120
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:23,042
 misinterpretation because he
says it may lead to death or

121
00:19:23,146 --> 00:19:28,896
 he only says whether it may lead to
death, but I will explain it to you.

122
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:38,021
-Wait a moment. Find the aphorism which she is talking about so I can read it and I will tell you.

123
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:46,104
In the meantime you find this
and then she would like to respond.

124
00:19:46,927 --> 00:19:51,021
She says for me there is no difference
between epilepsy and a heart infarct

125
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:54,490
  because it is something which
happens inside the organism;

126
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:59,438
it is not an accident which
happens from the outside.

127
00:19:59,542 --> 00:20:07,969
And therefore the organism is
diseased and not under accident.

128
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:15,396
Now let me explain this idea fully.

129
00:20:15,906 --> 00:20:23,896
The organism before the
 heart infarct is diseased.

130
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:35,354
 That means is producing more cholesterol
and the arteries are becoming full

131
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:42,063
with cholesterol and eventually
one piece breaks out and circulates.

132
00:20:42,906 --> 00:20:54,375
Now the organism which we have seen before the heart infarct, will give us some symptoms.

133
00:20:54,479 --> 00:21:09,458
These symptoms will lead us to the remedy that the organism will stop producing high cholesterol.

134
00:21:10,063 --> 00:21:20,490
Now take another. An organism is producing stones, on the gall bladder or on the kidneys.

135
00:21:20,594 --> 00:21:32,177
They come to us, no symptoms but there are some general symptoms that we may use in

136
00:21:32,281 --> 00:21:40,510
order to give the correct remedy so the
organism will stop producing stones.

137
00:21:40,615 --> 00:21:45,406
 You have given the correct remedy
 and the organism is doing well.

138
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:57,271
 Inspite of this fact one day because he eats
 a lot of fat, there is a big contraction of the

139
00:21:57,375 --> 00:22:07,000
gall bladder and the stone sticks in there.
That is an accident, it is not a disease.

140
00:22:07,667 --> 00:22:12,781
That accident you have to treat at this
moment according to the symptoms

141
00:22:12,885 --> 00:22:19,354
it has developed and if you give the
right remedy in most of the cases,

142
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:28,667
  not all, will be almost immediately ameliorated.

143
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:37,094
So what we are interested in is the time that we have the spasm and the symptomatology.

144
00:22:37,198 --> 00:22:47,510
The symptomatology tells you how to act.
It is the organism which tells you,

145
00:22:47,615 --> 00:22:51,313
 hey you homeopath act in this way,
 these are the symptoms.

146
00:22:51,417 --> 00:22:54,948
Find the remedy and give it to me.

147
00:22:55,052 --> 00:23:02,073
You found it? Which paragraph?

148
00:23:02,177 --> 00:23:04,021
-22.

149
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:35,063
- par. 22: " But there is nothing to be observed
 in diseases that must be removed

150
00:23:35,167 --> 00:23:35,813
 in order to change them into health.
 Besides the totality of such symptoms,

151
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:49,333
 likewise Medicine can show nothing curative ..." am I reading the right paragraph?

152
00:23:49,438 --> 00:23:52,146
-The sub-note.

153
00:23:52,250 --> 00:24:15,531
-Sub-note, all right. "The other possible
mode of employing medicines for disease

154
00:24:15,635 --> 00:24:19,469
besides these two is the allopathic
method in which  medicines are given,

155
00:24:19,573 --> 00:24:23,917
 whose symptoms have no direct
pathological relation to the morbid state,

156
00:24:24,021 --> 00:24:28,479
neither similar nor opposite but quite heterogenous to the symptoms of the disease.

157
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:37,073
 This procedure plays an irresponsible murderous game with the life of the patient by

158
00:24:37,177 --> 00:24:43,073
means of dangerous, violent medicines etc."

159
00:24:43,177 --> 00:25:10,521
....... (reading extracts from Organon)

160
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:23,115
He says, there is no other way and he repeats
 it frequently that you can cure a disease,

161
00:25:23,219 --> 00:25:27,813
only by taking into consideration the
symptoms of the person

162
00:25:28,281 --> 00:25:34,146
 and find the Homeopathic remedy,
 there is no other way.

163
00:25:37,844 --> 00:25:52,802
So the symptoms are the means by which the organism is trying to keep a kind of a balance

164
00:25:52,906 --> 00:25:59,938
and at the same time it is pointing out the
means through which it's going to be helped.

165
00:26:00,042 --> 00:26:22,667
If this is not given .....
......( reading Organon).....

166
00:26:22,771 --> 00:26:35,563
Your question is: if you have a severe acute disease from which the patient is going to die,

167
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:42,406
is that considered to be a means of trying
to keep balance? Is that your question?

168
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:54,948
-No, you say that with the remedy we
make the disease a little bit worse.

169
00:26:56,813 --> 00:27:04,031
-Ah the question is if you have a severe disease and you make it more severe, the patient dies?

170
00:27:04,135 --> 00:27:16,531
-In disease of typhus I would say that.
And you say that this is the explanation

171
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:20,188
for all diseases so I cannot follow it.

172
00:27:20,292 --> 00:27:31,490
-Ok. This is a good question. What
experience has shown in this respect is

173
00:27:31,594 --> 00:27:43,740
that if you have a case in which
 a symptom is dangerous

174
00:27:43,844 --> 00:27:50,896
out of 20 symptoms of the patient, one is dangerous, let us take high blood pressure.

175
00:27:51,000 --> 00:28:01,333
You have a patient with 250/160,
this is dangerous situation.

176
00:28:01,438 --> 00:28:07,646
 You give a remedy, you raise the blood
pressure and you say you have a brain stroke.

177
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:11,917
Is this your question?

178
00:28:12,021 --> 00:28:13,708
-No.

179
00:28:13,813 --> 00:28:30,438
-You want the fever? The fever will come. Now the organism under this, has several symptoms.

180
00:28:30,885 --> 00:28:44,667
What the remedy will do is to
aggravate urination.

181
00:28:44,771 --> 00:28:56,229
Urination was 5 times, it makes it 20.
 It aggravates the perspiration

182
00:28:56,333 --> 00:29:12,979
and then you see here coming down, 240.
So the organism knows what he has to do.

183
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:20,167
He cannot do it. You have to help him,
do it. In the same way with the fever.

184
00:29:20,958 --> 00:29:33,313
In typhus actually the danger comes from
what? From perforation of the intestines.

185
00:29:33,417 --> 00:29:42,271
The inflammation in the intestines is very
 severe, you can have a perforation,

186
00:29:42,375 --> 00:29:57,417
 they just break, the inflammation is defused, becomes severe peritonitis and the patient dies.

187
00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:09,490
So the organism will do the same process.
It will know exactly what it has to do.

188
00:30:09,594 --> 00:30:14,885
How perforation is done?

189
00:30:18,354 --> 00:30:28,406
To a certain point there is a big inflammation,
 so the mucus membranes of the colon

190
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:32,490
 are eaten up and then they break.

191
00:30:32,594 --> 00:30:40,354
At that point the organism will
heal this inflammation first.

192
00:30:40,458 --> 00:30:49,156
At the same time making more stool,
more perspiration whatever is the aggravation.

193
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:54,917
But the aggravation under the Homeopathic remedy will not be a dangerous

194
00:30:55,021 --> 00:31:02,281
one that will raise the blood pressure. Clear?

195
00:31:03,042 --> 00:31:11,854
-I have a question because for me your theory is
 logical but what about the autoaggression illness

196
00:31:11,958 --> 00:31:19,875
 because it is against my body and I don't think
 is a symptom to reach my balance back.

197
00:31:25,792 --> 00:31:35,271
-In paragraph 67 Hahnemann says that in special cases you can use palliative when the life force

198
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:43,333
 is so low that Homeopathic remedy
will be too much for the organism.

199
00:31:49,708 --> 00:32:04,021
-Find me the paragraph-67. Wait a moment,
 let's clarify one by one the issues.

200
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:10,667
What about a case of suicidal depression?

201
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:18,354
-Autoaggression.

202
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:24,219
-Autoaggression is a new word.

203
00:32:29,625 --> 00:32:35,198
-She is talking about autoimmune diseases.

204
00:32:35,302 --> 00:32:49,469
-Systemic, autoimmune diseases.
 The organism the more sick it becomes,

205
00:32:49,573 --> 00:32:53,917
the more it becomes out of balance.

206
00:32:54,021 --> 00:32:58,073
And that is how death takes place.

207
00:32:58,177 --> 00:33:07,406
We all die when the organism loses total
control. There is no way that we can stop

208
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:11,854
death with Homeopathy. So there is a
 point in the organism where the organism

209
00:33:16,771 --> 00:33:27,333
has reached its limits and therefore
 the organism cannot do anymore anything.

210
00:33:27,646 --> 00:33:31,938
Nevermind how much we try
homeopathically or allopathically,

211
00:33:32,042 --> 00:33:36,604
people will be dying once they
have reached that point.

212
00:33:36,708 --> 00:33:45,542
No way of saving all the people and
let them live indefinitely.

213
00:33:45,667 --> 00:34:01,469
We have to accept the idea that at a certain
 point death will ensue. Now you say that

214
00:34:01,573 --> 00:34:15,750
a schizophrenic, total mad person, is
this a reaction to save this person?

215
00:34:16,177 --> 00:34:23,708
And I say, yes this is the only way
 that he will not commit suicide,

216
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:33,823
that he will not be killed, that he will
not have something which will end his life.

217
00:34:33,927 --> 00:34:36,833
 Still the organism is trying to find an outlet.

218
00:34:38,187 --> 00:34:48,531
Schizophrenia is an outlet to get out of a certain problem which is so great for the organism;

219
00:34:48,635 --> 00:34:53,510
 maybe for you is very little but for
this organism is very strong

220
00:34:53,615 --> 00:35:04,042
 and it goes off and it becomes mad. So the madness is a reaction towards something

221
00:35:04,146 --> 00:35:19,573
 which endangers life. Also it has symptoms,
also you can be treating such cases.

222
00:35:19,781 --> 00:35:24,260
Now there is another question that was put.

223
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:35,448
-I have a question concerning the suppression. Because after the suppression in this case,

224
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:43,073
you got the main symptom for prescribing
the remedy and I ask myself would

225
00:35:43,177 --> 00:35:54,635
  you have given this remedy before. So this suppression forced the body to produce

226
00:35:55,021 --> 00:36:10,948
stronger, deeper symptom and
the suppression was gone.

227
00:36:12,531 --> 00:36:17,552
And I am now confused because I thought
 if there is a strong suppression you take

228
00:36:17,656 --> 00:36:21,375
 the symptoms before the suppression.

229
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:33,333
-Not always. What actually we are
doing here, is what Hahnemann

230
00:36:33,437 --> 00:36:51,073
describes in one-sided diseases. He says,
 many times a physical disease becomes mental.

231
00:36:51,177 --> 00:36:59,844
These diseases I call one-sided diseases.
Then, he says, you give a remedy and the

232
00:36:59,948 --> 00:37:08,896
 mental symptoms go away and the
physical symptoms return.

233
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:15,333
 In the case that we have seen,
we have seen mental symptoms

234
00:37:15,438 --> 00:37:20,802
developing and I have seen cases
where these mental symptoms

235
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:29,000
have stayed for life,
 after the antibiotics.

236
00:37:29,104 --> 00:37:37,646
'My boy has become aggressive, dissatisfied'
 and the mother describe that state

237
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:49,896
as a permanent state. Now he comes to you
and you see that the picture of the symptoms,

238
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,687
 presented at the moment,
point out to one remedy.

239
00:37:55,792 --> 00:38:04,646
You have to give that remedy. If the picture
 was more clear of the previous state,

240
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:10,844
you could ignore these changes and
say  the picture was so clear before

241
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:15,156
that I will give that picture.

242
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:21,938
But the picture was so obvious,
having this dissatisfaction,

243
00:38:22,042 --> 00:38:27,073
it was obvious for everyone to see,
therefore you have to prescribe on

244
00:38:27,177 --> 00:38:34,354
this main symptom of the case. So we
prescribe on the main symptoms of the case.

245
00:38:34,458 --> 00:38:45,823
I will be discussing further the strategies,
 how to tackle each case and

246
00:38:45,927 --> 00:38:52,083
what are the methods through
 which we discuss the case.

247
00:38:53,219 --> 00:39:01,688
-I have another question regarding par. 22, the footnote. How do you evaluate the life force?

248
00:39:01,792 --> 00:39:09,333
Do you also think it is a senseless and what Hahnemann states here, life force ?

249
00:39:09,438 --> 00:39:20,094
Or do you think it makes sense to actually put
a signal for the person to heal the disease?

250
00:39:20,198 --> 00:39:33,490
Hahnemann writes word by word that he thinks that the life force is senseless, footnote par. 22.

251
00:39:33,594 --> 00:39:37,490
-When we go to paragraph, we will discuss it.

252
00:39:37,594 --> 00:40:01,583
What I want your attention is to par. 11 and
12 in which Hahnemann says that:

253
00:40:02,573 --> 00:40:14,448
 "when a person falls ill, it's only this
spiritual self acting automatic vital force,

254
00:40:14,552 --> 00:40:20,375
everywhere present in his organism,
that is primarily deranged

255
00:40:20,479 --> 00:40:28,979
by the dynamic influence upon
 it of a morbific agent.

256
00:40:29,083 --> 00:40:35,021
It is only the vital principle deranged
 to such an abnormal state,

257
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:42,510
 that can furnish the organism
 with its disagreable sensation.

258
00:40:42,615 --> 00:40:50,875
And incline it to the regular processess
 which we call disease..........."

259
00:40:50,979 --> 00:41:25,562
....(reading par.11).....

260
00:41:25,667 --> 00:41:39,115
So the idea of Hahnemann is that the disease
 is only the symptoms which are apparent

261
00:41:39,219 --> 00:41:47,094
 to the observing physician and to the
patient himself and to the relatives.

262
00:41:47,198 --> 00:41:55,802
He says, this is the disease and these
symptoms you have to take into consideration

263
00:41:55,906 --> 00:42:01,771
 to cure the disease. Hahnemann
 has a logic, you have to imagine,

264
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:18,792
 behind all these there is a logic. He says,
 the derangement comes from a dynamic

265
00:42:18,885 --> 00:42:26,094
influence upon the vital force of a morbific
agent. Then the symptoms are appearing.

266
00:42:26,198 --> 00:42:32,417
Take in consideration the symptoms
and treat according to the symptoms.

267
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:44,406
And then he says: all medicinal
substances have unlimited power

268
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:50,583
over the organism. That means
 they can produce diseases

269
00:42:50,688 --> 00:42:53,250
whether the organism wants it or not.

270
00:42:53,354 --> 00:42:56,729
They can produce symptoms
whether the organism wants it or not,

271
00:42:56,833 --> 00:43:03,333
take Arsenicum in big enough dose,
everyone will have symptoms.

272
00:43:03,438 --> 00:43:15,917
Some they will die. This is what he knows.
So his logic is that since this medicine

273
00:43:16,021 --> 00:43:22,167
is more powerful than disease,
if I give a more powerful agent,

274
00:43:22,271 --> 00:43:31,115
 the disease will be overpowered. He comes to this conclusion because he has observed

275
00:43:31,219 --> 00:43:39,146
that in natural epidemic diseases,
an epidemic disease which is similar

276
00:43:39,177 --> 00:43:44,854
in its expression with another one,
 can annihilate, can cure.

277
00:43:44,958 --> 00:43:53,979
One disease can cure another. So he develops
 a logic according to this observation.

278
00:43:54,083 --> 00:44:03,354
The logic is now that the medicine
is stronger, has a power.

279
00:44:03,458 --> 00:44:12,250
Therefore if I give it like the
epidemics, which are similar,

280
00:44:12,354 --> 00:44:16,979
the one annihilates the other
 and runs its course.

281
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:28,583
In the same way, the medicine is more
powerful, I give it and then he had observed

282
00:44:28,688 --> 00:44:39,323
there awere some symptoms left by the drug.
 He says, now the disease runs its course.

283
00:44:47,042 --> 00:44:58,073
The problem is that it has a loop hole that thinking and it doesn't satisfy a logical person.

284
00:44:58,177 --> 00:45:00,604
How this is happening?

285
00:45:00,708 --> 00:45:09,938
You throw a stronger and then they fight
each other and the other one is strong

286
00:45:10,042 --> 00:45:16,490
and run its course? All this makes no sense.

287
00:45:16,594 --> 00:45:22,021
When I was reading the Organon,
 I had these problems.

288
00:45:22,125 --> 00:45:39,896
  I said, now this doesn't look logical.
Then I observed what was happening

289
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:50,208
in diseases and how the organism
 when it is under stimulus reacts.

290
00:45:54,250 --> 00:46:07,333
Let us, it's very hot in here. My organism
 has to react in order to survive.

291
00:46:07,438 --> 00:46:11,448
 How to react, by perspiration.
Why to perspire?

292
00:46:11,552 --> 00:46:20,740
Because I have to cool down my organism. Otherwise, heat, heat, I will just collapse.

293
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:33,188
So the organism under stimulus will react
to bring back balance. Otherwise you lost.

294
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:44,021
The organism says, trembling. These
are movements to heat up the body,

295
00:46:44,125 --> 00:46:50,667
 it says put on a jacket. If you don't
 put a jacket you will die.

296
00:46:50,771 --> 00:46:59,833
Heat, you perspire and you go and find a place
 to sit not under the heat because you'll die.

297
00:46:59,938 --> 00:47:08,021
These are natural reactions
 of the organism.

298
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:19,500
If I will say to you something
very bad, you lost your child.

299
00:47:22,125 --> 00:47:30,823
The heart immediately will go pap, pap, pap.
'I lost my child, what shall I do?

300
00:47:30,927 --> 00:47:40,844
I must stay awake' because you may faint.
Many people have died under such a shock.

301
00:47:40,948 --> 00:47:53,688
The reaction of the organism unless it
brings the palpitation then you will fall down.

302
00:47:53,792 --> 00:48:02,740
So the organism says, what you can do? Palpitation, give more energy.

303
00:48:02,844 --> 00:48:10,156
More oxygen, more perspiration, there
is a whole reaction of the organism.

304
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:20,125
This reaction is not mad, senseless or
whatever. It is very intelligent and the best

305
00:48:20,229 --> 00:48:27,292
the organism it can do. If we agree
 in that principle then we have to

306
00:48:27,396 --> 00:48:37,135
 admit that when we give a similar remedy,
we stimulate the organism in a similar

307
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:45,479
manner, very intelligent manner
and help him in his reaction.

308
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:50,948
This is the logic behind.

309
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:58,604
One thing I would like to say concerning
 the senseless vital force.

310
00:48:58,708 --> 00:49:02,250
 I will explain to you
what he means.

311
00:49:02,354 --> 00:49:17,333
He says that the vital force is a
neutral thing. It doesn't like this, that,

312
00:49:17,438 --> 00:49:26,115
has no senses, no feelings, no thoughts. Whatever you do to her it responds.

313
00:49:27,438 --> 00:49:32,708
 You do good things, it responds good,
you do bad things, it responds bad.

314
00:49:32,813 --> 00:49:43,625
So it is a neutral force
which animates everything.

315
00:49:43,729 --> 00:49:49,625
 Now you go and you do bad things
 to that thing which it animates,

316
00:49:49,729 --> 00:50:00,417
the vital force will respond. So senseless
means without preferences, without thinking.

317
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:13,156
A force which does not think does
 not feel, does not have senses.

318
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:23,313
There is, as we have explained
in the first session, there is a force

319
00:50:23,417 --> 00:50:34,313
which animates everything.
In everything there is a force which

320
00:50:34,417 --> 00:50:49,271
takes the shape of the tree, the plant,
it's the same force that animates the plant,

321
00:50:49,375 --> 00:50:58,438
 it animates the body, it makes life to the body.
The same force animates the stone, the metal

322
00:50:59,708 --> 00:51:14,625
and creates forms. So it's a neutral force
which takes the shape of the things that

323
00:51:14,729 --> 00:51:26,781
animates. If this was not so, there would
be no correspondence between the force

324
00:51:26,885 --> 00:51:37,469
of the plant and the force of the organism.
It is because this is common to all, that is why

325
00:51:37,573 --> 00:51:43,813
the force of the plant can affect
the force of the organism.

326
00:51:43,917 --> 00:51:50,563
Otherwise it would be something different. Different force that makes the stone

327
00:51:50,667 --> 00:52:05,146
and the animals, the insects etc. The fact is
that everything is animated by a neutral force.

328
00:52:05,948 --> 00:52:12,813
Neutral would be better than
senseless or thoughtless.

329
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:36,427
In religion they say that God is within us,
 all religions say God is within you.

330
00:52:36,531 --> 00:52:41,365
 What they mean is God is that cosmic
 force that goes through everything

331
00:52:41,469 --> 00:52:49,448
and goes through you as well. The
difference is that human beings have

332
00:52:49,552 --> 00:52:53,510
free choice and they
can do whatever they like.

333
00:52:53,615 --> 00:53:04,167
They can be well, they can be sick,
they can be perverted, bad, malicious etc.

334
00:53:26,615 --> 00:53:35,448
It doesn't mean that Hahnemann
is wrong, no. Hahnemann followed

335
00:53:35,552 --> 00:53:44,375
a way of thinking and concluded this.
He was not wrong.

336
00:53:44,479 --> 00:53:51,010
Actually everything he writes
 is correct. Except of that point.

337
00:54:22,042 --> 00:54:34,469
-Yesterday you talked about the vital force.
 And you said it's automatic

338
00:54:34,573 --> 00:54:43,438
and really you translated
Hahnemann, in your first book.

339
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:53,250
-From my book? I wrote it 30 years ago.

340
00:54:53,333 --> 00:55:00,802
-Yes I know but it's about what we talked yesterday. When he says, self-acting

341
00:55:00,906 --> 00:55:12,354
you quote it like automatic but then you quote Kent from his lectures and Kent said that

342
00:55:12,458 --> 00:55:19,646
vital force is a formative intelligence.

343
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:30,177
And you agree with him. I just want to ask, how formative intelligence goes with automatic?

344
00:55:30,948 --> 00:55:47,490
-That's a good question. We are talking
 about a force, an energy and

345
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:55,927
what Hahnemann most probably
meant by "senseless" "automatic",

346
00:55:56,031 --> 00:56:10,333
he writes about senseless, automatic or
without thought, is an energy which has no will,

347
00:56:10,438 --> 00:56:19,448
has no power of its own. Because there are
 other certain elements which interfere

348
00:56:19,552 --> 00:56:31,219
with every creature. With the wood, the
stone we have certain conditions.

349
00:56:31,396 --> 00:56:37,896
With the plants we have different
conditions. So we can say,

350
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:49,000
in another way, that there are several
 levels of consciousness

351
00:56:49,104 --> 00:57:04,135
that means minerals have a
consciousness of a-degree

352
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:14,885
and then plants have a
consciousness of b-degree.

353
00:57:14,990 --> 00:57:18,417
It's a different cosciousness.

354
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:37,198
Animals have a
consciousness of c-degree.

355
00:57:38,594 --> 00:57:50,531
 And humans have a
consciousness of d-degree.

356
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:14,833
The higher consciousness entities are fed
by the lower consciousness entities.

357
00:58:16,156 --> 00:58:28,500
Plants are fed by minerals,
animals are fed by the plants.

358
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:42,938
They are physical bodies,
physical entities.

359
00:58:43,042 --> 00:59:04,969
But we have said that humans
 are also having free will,

360
00:59:12,177 --> 00:59:21,813
and  what is the difference between
 animals and plants?

361
00:59:21,917 --> 00:59:28,688
We have a part in us which we
call the spiritual part and

362
00:59:28,792 --> 00:59:35,198
we have a part of us
which we call the love.

363
00:59:35,302 --> 00:59:45,979
We have love and wisdom,
which is missing on these entities.

364
00:59:51,104 --> 01:00:06,042
You are asking about what?
The question of Hahnemann is:

365
01:00:06,146 --> 01:00:20,521
The energy which goes right through all
 these entities has a kind of similarity?

366
01:00:20,625 --> 01:00:28,604
You can say it's the same energy.
 If this was not the same energy,

367
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:33,292
these minerals could
not affect the human.

368
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:41,469
When you bring out the energy of the
mineral, it affects the energy of the human.

369
01:00:41,573 --> 01:00:49,854
A gas can affect a gas, water can affect
water. Liquids can affect liquids

370
01:00:49,958 --> 01:01:03,177
and solids can affect solids. You
cannot affect a solid with a gas.

371
01:01:03,281 --> 01:01:10,563
So there is a similarity in the
energy that goes through this.

372
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:15,771
 What is the difference between this and that?

373
01:01:16,302 --> 01:01:32,688
These minerals, they have their own rules and intelligence and they will form the crystals

374
01:01:32,792 --> 01:01:39,354
or whatever is to be formed in
this level of consciousness.

375
01:01:39,458 --> 01:02:02,406
So the energy is used by these different consciousness manifestations in the planet,

376
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:13,281
 each one of them forming its own
 needs, fulfilling its own mission.

377
01:02:15,479 --> 01:02:21,333
These minerals, their mission
 is to grow the plants.

378
01:02:24,906 --> 01:02:30,854
If they don't grow plants they don't
 have a mission, they are dead.

379
01:02:30,958 --> 01:02:38,958
The idea of entropy, you understand
 this law of thermodynamics?

380
01:02:39,063 --> 01:02:42,667
When do we have the biggest entropy?

381
01:02:42,771 --> 01:02:56,594
In the stone. The stone is considered as
the total entropy where nothing moves.

382
01:02:57,635 --> 01:03:09,552
So the minerals do not fulfill their mission anymore. They do not sustain the plants.

383
01:03:17,292 --> 01:03:30,979
The energy that goes through them
 is used by each consciousness.

384
01:03:31,083 --> 01:03:40,135
Hahnemann says, the energy
will not tell you: become sick.

385
01:03:40,458 --> 01:03:46,646
You can use this energy, you can
be sick or you can be well.

386
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:58,979
And here as humans we have the freedom
 to do that. Here, in this consciousness

387
01:03:59,083 --> 01:04:07,156
what is missing is the free will. There is
no free will on these levels.

388
01:04:08,531 --> 01:04:22,375
 The need of the mineral in order
to sustain itself is minimal.

389
01:04:24,083 --> 01:04:47,667
The humans have the possibility of changing their destiny. These, they don't have it.

390
01:04:47,771 --> 01:04:53,510
These are only to support the humans.

391
01:04:55,750 --> 01:05:02,604
And here we have the highest form of consciousness in the planet.

392
01:05:02,708 --> 01:05:16,156
But underneath all this which takes
place is an energy which is neutral.

393
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:25,198
It is like somebody tells you, 'I will give
you life you do whatever you like.

394
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:34,240
You destroy, I will follow.'

395
01:05:38,917 --> 01:05:45,313
We are talking about two different things.
 When Kent says that energy

396
01:05:45,417 --> 01:05:53,406
has informative intelligence, what he says,
the intelligence that Kent means is,

397
01:05:53,510 --> 01:06:02,021
'if you stimulate me correctly, I will follow.
 I will do good for you.

398
01:06:02,958 --> 01:06:08,813
If you stimulate me wrongly, I will follow.
I will do bad for you.

399
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:18,865
Then it is in your free will, as humans.
to decide what you want to do with me',

400
01:06:18,969 --> 01:06:26,354
with the energy which you have inside.

401
01:06:27,792 --> 01:06:43,177
So the energy cannot resist the free will that we have. The energy will give you what you are.

402
01:06:51,531 --> 01:06:57,021
These are difficult subjects to
understand but here we have

403
01:06:57,125 --> 01:07:03,396
an evolution of consciousness actually.

404
01:07:04,177 --> 01:07:10,219
That's why we say sometimes,
he behaves like an animal.

405
01:07:11,708 --> 01:07:25,083
Here the idea is that he behaves without free
will, without choice, without discrimination.

406
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:38,938
He behaves like a pig, especially for men with sexual interference etc. What does it mean?

407
01:07:39,042 --> 01:07:47,406
That the consciousness which you have,
 you are using it against you.

408
01:07:47,510 --> 01:07:54,510
Instead of going somewhere higher,
 because there might be here another

409
01:07:54,615 --> 01:08:01,219
level of consciousness which we
may call, the super consciousness.

410
01:08:01,573 --> 01:08:10,646
This is a level of consciousness in which
you have evolved and you have reached

411
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:15,604
the highest possible state
 for the human being.

412
01:08:15,708 --> 01:08:28,510
Which is the state of love and wisdom,
feelings full of love, thoughts full of wisdom.

413
01:08:29,594 --> 01:08:37,229
So the energy is going to make you
feel love or wisdom? Forget it.

414
01:08:37,333 --> 01:08:44,333
The energy says, I'm here,
I will support you, I am behind you.

415
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:51,625
You do whatever you like with me.
 I am senseless, I don't have thoughts.

416
01:08:51,729 --> 01:08:59,177
I don't have feelings. You decide what
are you going to do with me.

417
01:08:59,281 --> 01:09:04,896
I have given you this form because you
are born as a human being and then

418
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:09,510
you decide what you are going to do.

419
01:09:09,615 --> 01:09:16,823
So when Hahnemann says, 'senseless',
he means something, he means this

420
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:26,198
neutral power which goes all these
different levels of consciousness

421
01:09:26,302 --> 01:09:38,510
and when Kent describes some qualities,
he says this energy which gives you

422
01:09:38,615 --> 01:09:47,458
the possibility to be a human being or an
animal or a plant or mineral.

423
01:09:50,354 --> 01:09:54,771
I will tell you a secret.

424
01:10:04,146 --> 01:10:17,438
On the physical level, the higher
 is fed from the lower.

425
01:10:19,510 --> 01:10:35,802
On spiritual level, the lower feeds from the
 higher which is God super consciousness.

426
01:10:35,906 --> 01:10:51,552
On the spiritual level, we feed on ideas but the real ideas come from truth, come from God.

427
01:10:51,885 --> 01:11:06,813
So in order to evolve here and to grow up, we have to be fed, the lower is fed from the higher.

428
01:11:08,125 --> 01:11:14,531
On the physical level, the higher
is fed from the lower.

429
01:11:14,635 --> 01:11:25,156
Animals feeds from plants, plants from minerals.
On the spiritual level, the lower, we, fed on ideas,

430
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:35,469
 fed from God in order to mature,
in order to become whole human beings.

431
01:11:35,573 --> 01:11:49,635
We are half human beings, we vacillate between superconsiousness and subconsciousness.

432
01:12:08,104 --> 01:12:20,781
- When you say about cosmic energy, is
 that it must be a being without the body,

433
01:12:20,885 --> 01:12:27,115
where you can put the vital force or the
cosmic energy in this degree, in this scale?

434
01:12:27,219 --> 01:12:30,615
Where would you put it near?

435
01:12:43,125 --> 01:12:54,781
-You see, here we have levels of consciousness, we say 4. Is it really 4 or 24 or 104

436
01:12:54,885 --> 01:13:00,844
and what levels of consciousness do we have after our consciousness? How many levels?

437
01:13:00,948 --> 01:13:09,021
We say super consciousness. Is it
possible that we reach one level?

438
01:13:09,125 --> 01:13:15,927
What is the level of consciousness of a yogi?
 Of a man who sits and meditates?

439
01:13:16,510 --> 01:13:18,958
Of a man who prays,
of a man in a monastery?

440
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:24,417
What are the levels of consciousness
that they have reached?

441
01:13:24,521 --> 01:13:32,865
All of them have reached the same level?
 Similar levels or several levels

442
01:13:32,969 --> 01:13:40,073
or struggling all the time
attaining a better level?

443
01:13:40,177 --> 01:13:48,396
 There are different levels of
consciousness, definitely after this human.

444
01:13:48,500 --> 01:14:01,115
We realize more and more we go into Homeopathy, that we are not so much animals.

445
01:14:01,219 --> 01:14:16,313
Or that there is some other possibility for the human being to become more evolved

446
01:14:16,417 --> 01:14:20,583
and maybe we take the possibility.

447
01:14:20,688 --> 01:14:30,188
But as Hahnemann says, the remedy will reestablish order but you are responsible

448
01:14:30,292 --> 01:14:34,354
for the higher purposes of life.

449
01:14:34,458 --> 01:14:42,448
You can use now your body, your good
energy for the higher purposes of your life,

450
01:14:42,552 --> 01:14:51,667
par. 9 for your test paper.

451
01:14:53,906 --> 01:15:02,646
Also there is an attitude by certain Homeopaths. They say forget about this theory,

452
01:15:02,750 --> 01:15:13,573
just give me information about the Materia Medica. This attitude is very wrong.

453
01:15:14,906 --> 01:15:18,979
Materia Medica can be learned.

454
01:15:19,083 --> 01:15:28,917
Theory, is either learned wrongly or
not learned at all, is very dangerous.
