1
00:00:18,948 --> 00:00:26,042
-I just wanted to ask, could one
add something to the bruises?

2
00:00:26,146 --> 00:00:31,115
Like Arnica or Calendula, would this
be possible without ruining a case?

3
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:39,240
-Yes. If it is applied not internally.
How it happened? By motorbike?

4
00:00:39,344 --> 00:00:42,521
-Walking.

5
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:54,063
We have taken a remedy,
 high potency. If you have hay fever,

6
00:00:54,281 --> 00:00:57,125
could you have a small remedy?

7
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:09,063
- In case you have taken what
we call a constitutional remedy and

8
00:01:09,167 --> 00:01:14,490
something acute happens, especially
injuries, you try to avoid as much

9
00:01:14,594 --> 00:01:25,354
as possible taking internally a potency.
Of course if the injury is worse than the

10
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:30,042
disease itself, you have to treat it.

11
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:40,635
But if you can manage, I mean a little bit of Arnica outside, there is no problem.

12
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:51,490
-With hay fever I have been
told not to take anything.

13
00:01:55,813 --> 00:01:59,958
-You suffer with hay fever chronically?

14
00:02:00,344 --> 00:02:02,375
-Not all the time.

15
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:08,000
-Not all the time, in certain period,
like Autumn and Spring?

16
00:02:08,677 --> 00:02:10,396
-Yes.

17
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,042
-This looks like Euphrasia.

18
00:02:14,146 --> 00:02:16,396
-So I can take it?

19
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:22,396
-Yes, you can take it; I don't know.
Maybe it will cure everything but

20
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:29,375
what I see is Euphrasia
picture of the eyes.

21
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:34,167
-What is this?

22
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:45,573
-Redness in the conjunctiva,
redness on the lids together

23
00:02:45,677 --> 00:02:54,167
with a lot of lacrimation
indicates Euphrasia.

24
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:06,219
-I would like to know if somebody is taking
his constitutional remedy and generally

25
00:03:06,323 --> 00:03:14,219
 is or was under Homeopathic treatment
and after that gets migraine attack

26
00:03:14,927 --> 00:03:20,021
of very strong severity and then
calls me and says, what can I do?

27
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:25,156
Then I just can give another homeopathic remedy in between, what should I tell them?

28
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,844
Should I tell them to use some
allopathic medication to stop the pain

29
00:03:29,948 --> 00:03:34,510
or what should the person do because
 it's an intolerable situation?

30
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:40,688
But if I give a remedy then I disturb
again; so what do I do?

31
00:03:40,792 --> 00:03:49,521
-You have to judge what is this headache
 about. Is this a chronic headache

32
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:56,198
which has come after your medication?
The person suffers chronically

33
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:59,219
you give the remedy and immediately
 next day, two days later

34
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:03,708
there is a huge headache much worse
 than every other headache.

35
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:08,667
These are typical expressions of
good reaction of a Homeopathic remedy.

36
00:04:08,771 --> 00:04:14,896
In this case you may wait for
2 days and then it's gone.

37
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,062
And then it's cured, no problem.
You say this is a good reaction.

38
00:04:19,167 --> 00:04:28,979
Now if the headache appears, let us
 say, one month after the treatment

39
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:37,563
and you were not treating the
 person for headaches.

40
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:43,198
The headache is something new
for the person and unbearable

41
00:04:43,302 --> 00:04:48,448
but in the meantime
this month is good for them.

42
00:04:48,552 --> 00:04:53,521
That means they feel good
psychologically, more energy, etc

43
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:59,375
that means that the organism
needs this phase of headache.

44
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:01,708
Now what you will do?

45
00:05:01,812 --> 00:05:07,521
Again it's better to leave it alone
and pass or at the most,

46
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:13,156
give some aspirin but not a remedy.

47
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:20,146
But if you have given a remedy and there is
 no action and after 1-2 months appears

48
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:25,729
 this headache, that means that most
probably your remedy is not acting

49
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:33,021
and therefore you can give whatever
you like, as a second choice.

50
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:38,000
But the moment that you feel that the
immediate reaction is because of the remedy

51
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:49,188
or there is a reaction later on but the person
is already reacting well to the medication,

52
00:05:49,292 --> 00:05:58,823
the best thing is to leave it alone and try
to explain, let's see how you go through.

53
00:05:58,927 --> 00:06:04,938
But sometimes the remedy has not acted
and we say, 'ok wait, the headache

54
00:06:05,042 --> 00:06:11,146
has not gone away', headache, headache,
then of course you have either

55
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:17,833
to give another remedy
or to give some pain killers.

56
00:06:18,635 --> 00:06:29,938
-George, you told us when there aren't
not so big injuries, you can use Arnica

57
00:06:30,042 --> 00:06:37,104
 externally, which potency? I ask
because I heard from a dentist he said,

58
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:56,708
under X6 the effect of Arnica is
controvert effect, it's leading to bleeding.

59
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:10,958
-These creams which they do,
not potencies, they have a cream

60
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:13,906
which they make and you can use.

61
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:21,979
Of course if this cream contains Arnica
10M is better not to use the cream

62
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:25,979
because by rubbing it also
you get the potency.

63
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:33,354
Usually these creams that they make are low potencies and this is not my experience.

64
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:38,292
If you take internally Arnica mother
tincture then most probably

65
00:07:38,396 --> 00:07:43,854
you can cause some bruises,
because you make a proving.

66
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:54,240
-What was your question about aggra-
vation? Because we have been discussing

67
00:07:54,344 --> 00:08:01,781
between us and it's obvious that in many
cases is very difficult to convince a patient

68
00:08:01,885 --> 00:08:08,417
that he has to wait then it's going to get
worse, then it's going to take a long time;

69
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:13,396
when he comes to you he has a
specific problem and he wants

70
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:20,104
to get better as soon as possible.
What is the solution about the aggravation?

71
00:08:21,438 --> 00:08:29,354
 Especially in cases of psoriasis, a young girl
is desperate because her skin is very bad.

72
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:34,448
If I tell her it's going to be an aggravation
and the skin becomes worse,

73
00:08:34,552 --> 00:08:37,771
she's going to run away.

74
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:46,781
-That is true, if you have a case
 of psoriasis which is not so bad

75
00:08:46,885 --> 00:08:50,229
because of the cortisone ointment.
 She has put cortisone, she comes to you

76
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:56,677
and says 'treat me now'.
You say, 'before you get well,

77
00:08:56,781 --> 00:09:01,552
you may just be full of psoriasis,
 if you want you do it'.

78
00:09:01,656 --> 00:09:04,229
Sometimes they say
'no, I want to get married first'.

79
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:07,219
 Ok, get married first and then you come.

80
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:26,115
It is best to have a completely open
discussion and state your opinion

81
00:09:26,219 --> 00:09:33,729
because if you don't tell them,
 when the aggravation comes,

82
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:40,083
you will have a big problem.
Because how to explain it afterwards?

83
00:09:45,302 --> 00:09:50,396
-From your experience did they always
 have aggravation in psoriasis cases ?

84
00:09:50,500 --> 00:10:01,437
-Not if the psoriasis is out, all its force is out. Then you don't have or you have little.

85
00:10:01,542 --> 00:10:17,354
 But if she says, at the age of 12 I was full.
And now you see only here and in the elbows;

86
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:24,417
 that means that there is a possibility to go
 back to full and you have to be careful.

87
00:10:26,521 --> 00:10:32,219
But if she comes and says,
'this is the worst I ever was',

88
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:46,250
It's ok, give it, no problem.
There is not going to be an aggravation.

89
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:55,021
-If they come to you with an inner
problem like the liver, the kidneys

90
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:59,448
and then you don't always
know what was in the past

91
00:10:59,552 --> 00:11:06,573
and then the aggravation of the skin
comes. Will you say it takes long?

92
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:13,938
-That's another thing you're asking.
If they come with an internal problem

93
00:11:14,042 --> 00:11:20,021
and then you give a remedy and then
there is a skin eruption, this is different.

94
00:11:20,042 --> 00:11:26,646
 Then this can be quite strong, this skin
eruption and can last quite long.

95
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:38,854
Then you have a problem. Like her case,
 the same. Her case is exactly like this.

96
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:43,135
She took the right remedy, it brought out the eruption and then immediately he tries to

97
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:53,229
 manipulate the eruption. You have the
 example, exactly what can happen.

98
00:11:53,333 --> 00:12:00,510
You suppress the eruption, it comes back.
 I told you about the child from France.

99
00:12:00,615 --> 00:12:07,990
 Sulphur, great eruption outside,
close it, then back.

100
00:12:09,573 --> 00:12:14,396
-I know but what I'm asking is
what I can tell the patient?

101
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,802
-You say to the patient, it might
 have a reaction like this

102
00:12:17,906 --> 00:12:24,135
and it might last for 2 years,
you explain.

103
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:30,063
-The problem is that they will
go to the allopathic.

104
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:34,729
-You see if you know what you're
doing and you explain beforehand;

105
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:43,844
I never had a problem with this because
 I more or less know what is going to happen

106
00:12:43,948 --> 00:12:54,979
and I tell them. And when it happens, they tolerate; otherwise they cannot tolerate.

107
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:58,354
If they think you gave the wrong remedy
 and now they have an eruption,

108
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:05,333
they can not tolerate it.
You have to explain properly.

109
00:13:05,438 --> 00:13:09,490
But of course don't explain that
 the reaction will be like this

110
00:13:09,594 --> 00:13:12,958
when there is not going to be a
reaction. Because there is the possibility

111
00:13:13,063 --> 00:13:20,583
that it's not going to be a reaction if you
 did not have the eruption before.

112
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:30,708
Then when the eruption comes, it is going
 to be little and then you can explain,

113
00:13:30,813 --> 00:13:38,969
'it's a good reaction, don't worry,
you have some eruption here and there'.

114
00:13:40,344 --> 00:13:48,490
-When a patient in his medical history
had mental symptoms, panic attacks

115
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:54,729
or fear then I can expect
that they come back.

116
00:13:54,833 --> 00:14:01,188
Old symptoms reoccur. Can I do this, that
 I tell the patient that your fear will come back,

117
00:14:01,292 --> 00:14:06,156
your panic attacks will come back and
maybe it will take 2 years until they go away.

118
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:11,531
 Can I say that to the patient?
And will they really last that long?

119
00:14:11,635 --> 00:14:22,510
-Let us say the patient had panic
attacks, fears and the patient comes

120
00:14:22,615 --> 00:14:30,688
 can I say to him, your panic attacks
will come back and you are going

121
00:14:30,792 --> 00:14:33,021
to stay with this for 2-3 years.

122
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:42,646
The answer in this case is that the
 panic attacks will not come back

123
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:51,448
because if you treat a person for
something, that something is better

124
00:14:51,552 --> 00:15:03,281
than the panic attacks.
You have to go here in the model.

125
00:15:03,385 --> 00:15:08,792
Panic attacks are here.

126
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:23,417
But you are treating the person for
asthma, for liver etc. you see it's lower.

127
00:15:23,521 --> 00:15:31,906
So this is a cure. That means the
person has been cured from panic

128
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:36,135
attacks and now he has psoriasis.

129
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,240
He is cured and now he has liver,
 heart problems.

130
00:15:44,219 --> 00:15:49,313
So this which was cured, will not
come back. Do you follow?

131
00:15:49,417 --> 00:15:52,281
-No.

132
00:15:54,083 --> 00:16:00,125
-Who does not understand this?
 Only you. Ok, I explain to you.

133
00:16:01,729 --> 00:16:10,729
The panic attacks is deeper problem, unless
you tell me that the person is schizophrenic.

134
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:23,344
I treat a case of schizophrenia, here is schizophrenia and now he has panic attacks.

135
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:44,271
In any case panic attacks is a deep
disorder and now he comes for asthma.

136
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:50,000
Asthma is a better condition,
not a worse condition.

137
00:16:50,104 --> 00:16:56,938
That means his panic attacks, by one way or another, either he took some allopathic drugs

138
00:16:57,042 --> 00:17:03,958
 or some psychotherapy and his
panic attacks were somatised.

139
00:17:06,677 --> 00:17:12,573
It will come back something which
was suppressed in the past.

140
00:17:12,677 --> 00:17:22,604
Suppressed in the past, means
it was worse. The opposite can be true.

141
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:34,313
Here, you are treating for panic attacks
 and if the person had asthma before,

142
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:40,677
then the asthma will come back.
But the opposite will not happen.

143
00:17:45,219 --> 00:17:58,458
We said, it will come back something that
has been suppressed in the past, not cured.

144
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:09,125
So you're treating asthma now and the
person had in the past, panic attacks.

145
00:18:09,927 --> 00:18:18,135
That means, the panic attacks
were transferred into asthma,

146
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:25,979
asthma is a curative process.
Panic attacks were not suppressed.

147
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:31,688
Here in the case where the person
originally had asthma and asthma

148
00:18:31,792 --> 00:18:39,354
 was treated badly and went back
to panic attacks, now that you treat

149
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:43,323
panic attacks, asthma will come back.

150
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:49,729
But it will not come back something
that was cured before.

151
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:56,250
-The patient had taken during the
panic attack, psychopharmaka.

152
00:18:56,792 --> 00:19:05,000
-If he had taken psychopharmaka
 and they produced asthma.

153
00:19:05,104 --> 00:19:12,802
He comes to you now and he says, treat me.

154
00:19:12,906 --> 00:19:20,354
If you treat him properly, his panic
attacks will never reappear, why?

155
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:26,177
Because panic attacks is
 a deeper state than asthma.

156
00:19:26,281 --> 00:19:33,729
Therefore it was cured by one way or
another, even with psychopharmaka

157
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:40,271
 the panic attacks were cured.
You can have somatisation

158
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:46,885
 of psychological problems
through different modalities.
