1
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:30,698
So even Hahnemann had some points in
which it was proven that he is not right.

2
00:00:30,802 --> 00:00:47,115
One of these points is when he says that a disease is cured by the Homeopathic remedy because the remedy

3
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:57,802
is producing an artificial disease on the body which is stronger than the natural disease.

4
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:15,771
This is a wrong assumption of Hahnemann, definitely and it's not important not even for him because he says

5
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:23,760
 in the Organon, you don't have to care howthis is accomplished, the cure but anyhow if you want me

6
00:01:23,865 --> 00:01:34,813
 to give you an explanation I can tell you.
An artificial disease is stronger than the disease and therefore

7
00:01:34,917 --> 00:01:39,146
it takes out the disease and plants the artificial.

8
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:50,625
The artificial has some more symptoms perhaps, what we see after a time, after you give a remedy,

9
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:56,021
you may see some symptoms of the remedy, afterwards.

10
00:01:56,552 --> 00:02:07,833
So Hahnemann thought that this is the artificial disease which is being planted, it pulled out the natural disease

11
00:02:07,938 --> 00:02:16,427
and now it's the artificial disease running its course and it's going to go away in a little while.

12
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:17,250
I want you to follow what I'm saying and to make sure that we communicate; otherwise there is no need for me talking.

13
00:03:31,552 --> 00:03:39,823
So this issue has to be clarified.

14
00:03:54,042 --> 00:03:56,604
 There was a misunderstanding concerning

15
00:03:56,708 --> 00:04:06,000
the hours so the German people
might have a problem with this.

16
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:24,813
No problem, they are becoming a little bit Mediterranean. You see in Greece or in Italy or in Spain,

17
00:04:24,917 --> 00:04:31,771
if this was taking place, we say we start at 9.30 and we start at 10.00 and everybody is happy.

18
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:38,396
So the moment you enter the class at 10.00 o'clock everybody is happy, talking and there is anxiety.

19
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:55,177
If you do this in Germany and you enter the class half an hour later, you had it. Nobody laughs, they sit there, straight.

20
00:04:58,667 --> 00:05:11,781
Once in Germany I put the flash light to turn to the main street and I hear somebody bip, bip, bip.

21
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:18,344
I don't understand, what's happening? I did some mistake. There was a very small street

22
00:05:18,448 --> 00:05:21,438
which I did not notice before I put the flash.

23
00:05:21,542 --> 00:05:30,052
The street was there and I put the flash after that. I should have turned that some street and not the next one.

24
00:05:30,156 --> 00:05:37,625
He thought if you put the flash before that street, you had to turn that street.

25
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:40,156
-That's right.

26
00:05:43,448 --> 00:06:07,885
-So from tomorrow we'll have German time.
So I would like to start this class with the idea of the provings.

27
00:06:10,427 --> 00:06:20,333
In Homeopathy we have the information of
what a remedy can do from the provings.

28
00:06:24,115 --> 00:06:40,229
So since many people of today-and this is very good and very interesting-are really interested and involved in provings,

29
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:51,052
we have to know what we are doing when we are doing provings, otherwise we are going to be in trouble

30
00:06:51,156 --> 00:07:00,875
and serious people will look at us and laugh. Unless we do seriously what we have to do.

31
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:12,292
How we do a proving? If in this class we want to make a proving, what should we do?

32
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:32,250
Hahnemann wrote in par.32, that all medicinal substances have an unlimited power over

33
00:07:32,354 --> 00:07:48,917
the human organism while diseases have a limited power over the human organism.

34
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:55,385
You have to have a predisposition to get the epidemic, you have to have a predisposition

35
00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:01,583
to get the disease, you have a genetic predisposition to get the psoriasis

36
00:08:01,688 --> 00:08:08,396
or the systemic disease or the neuromuscular disease, you have to have a predisposition.

37
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:41,115
Hahnemann's general idea was that the medicinal substances, that means the medicines

38
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:56,479
have a power greater than the disease.
And that led him to the idea that the medicine

39
00:08:56,583 --> 00:09:04,865
 because it is stronger, overpowers the
disease and then runs its course.

40
00:09:06,177 --> 00:09:13,896
Now it came from the idea that he said.
All medicinal substances have unlimited power

41
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:34,490
with one condition that they are given in large enough dose. So what that means?

42
00:09:38,917 --> 00:09:55,750
In a class like this, if we start an experiment
 with a remedy, with a plant, with Bryonia.

43
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:11,313
In order to produce symptoms in all the class,
we have to give a large enough dose,

44
00:10:11,417 --> 00:10:20,198
not as a general rule, but as an individual
need for each organism.

45
00:10:21,844 --> 00:10:42,656
That means we start with giving Bryonia mother tincture 30 drops to everyone. Next day 2 or 3 of you come and say,

46
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,875
 'I have developed these symptoms'.

47
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:58,396
That means 2-3 organisms, out of the whole class, are the most sensitive ones.

48
00:11:00,781 --> 00:11:13,844
And then you continue. Those people that they have developed symptoms already, have to stop taking the drug.

49
00:11:14,271 --> 00:11:28,813
Then next day the rest of the class continues to take 30 drops every day. In 2-3 days another small group appears

50
00:11:28,917 --> 00:11:40,938
to develop some symptoms, they stop. And you continue like this until you reach the most resistant organisms some

51
00:11:41,042 --> 00:11:53,917
that they may develop symptoms in the 20th day and after a repetition of several times. That means 30 drops,

52
00:11:54,021 --> 00:12:01,781
4 times the day. Then even the last one will develop some symptoms from this remedy.

53
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:19,073
Now the argument they bring, the allopathic physicians is that, how is it possible that you say you have symptoms

54
00:12:19,177 --> 00:12:31,542
 from salt, common salt, Natrum muriaticum, since we take everyone of us,

55
00:12:31,646 --> 00:12:39,448
we take from 5 to 7 grams a day of common salt.

56
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:48,854
The solution is in Hahnemann's
remark, large enough dose.

57
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:58,583
There are some of you who take double salt than the others, yet there are no symptoms, right?

58
00:12:58,688 --> 00:13:07,115
But try to triple the dose, that means
 instead of 7 grams, take14 grams or 21

59
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:14,917
or half a kilo and see if you
develop symptoms, yes or no?

60
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:28,396
So each organism needs a particular dose.
 Then immediately you will see the thirst that develops in Nat-m,

61
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:41,469
you will see the dryness, the headaches eventually and you will see all the effect on the whole system.

62
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,646
The same with Bryonia mother tincture.

63
00:13:48,625 --> 00:14:01,625
Now the other argument which they say is that you claim that you give one dose of Nat-m 200

64
00:14:01,729 --> 00:14:12,271
 in a group and you produce
symptoms, is this correct ? Yes or no?

65
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:34,500
This is a subject that the class has to understand very well, otherwise if you involve with this kind of discussions

66
00:14:34,604 --> 00:14:41,427
or application, to yourself or to others,
 you know what you are doing.

67
00:14:42,729 --> 00:15:00,375
So let us suppose that the whole class now instead of 100 gr of salt, takes a dose of
Nat-m 200.

68
00:15:01,542 --> 00:15:07,729
Who will develop symptoms?
Who will not develop symptoms?

69
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:22,823
-The sensitive ones. The sensitivess
to Nat-m develop symptoms fast.

70
00:15:23,917 --> 00:15:31,917
-Who are the sensitive ones? How do we
know who are the sensitive ones?

71
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:42,229
I'll tell you something else; I don't want to make
 the real experiment like this, but I could do it

72
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:47,427
and then I could prove it to you
but it's easy to understand.

73
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:59,156
I'm giving you tomorrow a powder because you agreed to do an experiment on proving.

74
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:09,427
Everybody takes the powder and the day
 after I tell some friends, like Fred there

75
00:16:09,531 --> 00:16:17,833
who could do it very well, that the
substance I have given is radioactive.

76
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:39,688
And Fred whispers radioactive, radioactive! And then on Wednesday you come to give me your symptoms.

77
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:51,917
Then you will see all the kinds of symptoms
even fainting, epileptic fits, paralysis,

78
00:16:52,021 --> 00:16:57,323
all kind of things will happen and
the class will go into spasm.

79
00:16:57,427 --> 00:17:06,219
This is a proving you know, a great proving,
we write down all the symptoms and it's all imagination.

80
00:17:09,781 --> 00:17:19,719
So when we give a high potency it's only the
very sensitive people to this remedy

81
00:17:19,823 --> 00:17:30,875
that may develop some symptoms, nobody else.
So if you see a proving in which a remedy has been given

82
00:17:30,979 --> 00:17:39,958
 and all the provers have developed a host
 of symptoms, hundreds of symptoms.

83
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:56,396
You say, wait a moment sir, this is, there is a
nice English word but not for ladies, nonsense.

84
00:18:00,781 --> 00:18:13,000
It is the imagination of the people who are part on the experiment. I take a substance, so I'm going to develop

85
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:23,146
some symptoms. Now I close my eyes and sometimes I say, how do you do it? You see we take the potency

86
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:28,427
and then close our eyes and meditate.

87
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:42,625
And then you write down the symptoms
 and all that, this is total nonsense.

88
00:18:42,729 --> 00:18:51,229
We have a lot of provings today which are done in this way. And these provings have gone into the books,

89
00:18:51,333 --> 00:19:05,177
have gone into the journals, have gone into the Radar system. Wait a moment, how did you get that?

90
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:23,479
So one project that you have, as you know, you are going to be doing test papers all the time.

91
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:38,469
One of the projects that you have to do is to write down the paragraphs which refer to provings in the Organon.

92
00:19:38,573 --> 00:19:45,156
Paragraphs that refer to the proving.

93
00:19:51,135 --> 00:20:05,427
These are individuals and everyone
of you has a different vibrational frequency.

94
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:19,917
So to which frequency you will be
 sensitive when I give you Nat-m?

95
00:20:20,292 --> 00:20:37,760
Here is a person whose frequency is very close. This person and this person who is close, we gave Nat-m 200.

96
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:44,271
This person's frequency is exact,
 what is going to happen?

97
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,198
-Cure.

98
00:20:54,823 --> 00:21:06,438
-He will be cured. Anyhow even with few symptoms. There was a scientist who came to take

99
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:18,531
an interview with me from a
scientific magazine from Germany.

100
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:39,688
She said to me, she is a biochemist and she said 'I don't believe all that, that 200 will create any symptoms

101
00:21:43,063 --> 00:21:49,771
can you give me a proof?'

102
00:21:50,917 --> 00:22:09,229
I looked at her, she stayed here for 3 days,
 3 days interview. She is writing in a very serious magazine.

103
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:18,021
And I thought shall I excuse myself? Shall I give all the theories? Or shall I do the experiment?

104
00:22:19,042 --> 00:22:30,323
I said ok, I'll do the experiment. In the meantime, I understood that her constitution is close to Nat-m.

105
00:22:30,427 --> 00:22:35,073
I said oh god if she's exact, she will be cured.

106
00:22:35,177 --> 00:22:41,344
If she is not exact, still she
 will develop some symptoms.

107
00:22:41,448 --> 00:22:46,271
So without explaining to her any of
these thoughts, of course, I said,

108
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:54,490
'ok you take Nat-m 200 and if you develop any symptoms you stop it; you take it every day'.

109
00:22:59,604 --> 00:23:11,833
She came to Berlin and she said,
'nothing happened'.

110
00:23:11,938 --> 00:23:20,188
I wrote in an envelope what symptoms she may have developed in case the remedy was not exact.

111
00:23:20,292 --> 00:23:26,344
She would develop some headaches
and dryness in the mouth.

112
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:35,708
She says, 'none of these symptoms that
you wrote down I have developed'.

113
00:23:41,531 --> 00:23:49,885
I said, 'yes but you are looking so radiant'.
She was looking really very happy.

114
00:23:50,396 --> 00:24:00,448
The first time I saw her I said, 'are you sad?'
'No, no, no I'm very good'. 'Ok', I said.

115
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:14,229
Now, in Berlin, she was so radiant; I said, 'you are looking so much better than the time I saw you'.

116
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:26,208
She said, 'yes that's true'. I said, 'well this is the thinking' and then I explained to her.

117
00:24:30,917 --> 00:24:40,156
She pondered on this idea. And this idea is exact, what I'm saying to you, here is going to be cured.

118
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:52,938
This, you gave a close remedy you are going to have some symptoms of the remedy developing but not a cure.

119
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:16,031
The vibrations which are changing, the further they go from the sensitivity of the remedy

120
00:25:16,135 --> 00:25:25,896
the less are affected. And here they are not affected at all, these people will not be affected
 at all.

121
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,990
How do we know that? We know because
when we give a wrong remedy to a person,

122
00:25:32,094 --> 00:25:40,563
he comes back and we say: what happened? Nothing, absolutely the same.

123
00:25:42,865 --> 00:25:49,833
But sometimes a person comes back
because you have given a close remedy,

124
00:25:49,938 --> 00:25:58,365
to this person you gave Natrum muriaticum,
you will have some symptoms.

125
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:14,323
Let us say he comes for headaches and
 you prescribe Natrum muriaticum,

126
00:26:14,427 --> 00:26:22,198
and the headache goes away and now
she has developed vertigo.

127
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:36,729
This is what we call a close remedy which
does not cure but changes the symptoms.

128
00:26:40,667 --> 00:26:51,052
So you can understand what is going to happen if you have given 5 remedies or 25 remedies.

129
00:26:51,156 --> 00:26:59,844
How many of the symptoms of the person
will change and then there is a confusion.

130
00:27:04,531 --> 00:27:23,083
Find for me in the Organon the aphorism in which Hahnemann talks exactly about this issue.

131
00:27:24,396 --> 00:27:33,656
Which is the issue? You give a remedy, you hit one symptom, the main symptom perhaps,

132
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,688
you change it but the case is not cured.

133
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:46,781
Which is the paragraph in which
Hahnemann refers to this issue?

134
00:27:48,427 --> 00:27:50,583
-247.

135
00:27:50,688 --> 00:27:55,365
-No, you are wrong, unfortunately it is not.
 Don't say it because all the class

136
00:27:55,469 --> 00:28:15,917
writes 247 and all the class gets zero. I don't want cooperation in these test papers is not allowed.

137
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:28,667
If the whole class writes to me the correct answer that means that one person found it and then spread the word.

138
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:54,823
You have to study the Organon and then from par.100-200 you may get it. Just study 100 par. and then you come.

139
00:28:57,427 --> 00:29:11,385
What is interesting here is that if we want to make an experiment, a proving how shall we go about?

140
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:16,542
We're talking now about the technical matters.

141
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:32,427
To prepare a sub-toxic dose of the remedy and then give it to the provers and see which

142
00:29:32,531 --> 00:29:42,781
of the provers are the most sensitive. To which they will develop symptoms for this remedy.

143
00:29:43,792 --> 00:29:55,646
And then in these provers, in the provers
 who have developed symptoms the first or the second day,

144
00:29:55,750 --> 00:30:06,750
 only to those provers you can give a high potency and find out what happens with the high potency.

145
00:30:06,802 --> 00:30:20,292
To the others is useless and they will give you information which is totally unreliable.

146
00:30:21,094 --> 00:30:29,719
They were telling me of an experiment they did in America with 3 groups. One took the remedy, one took placebo

147
00:30:29,823 --> 00:30:41,479
and one took nothing. The remedy
 that was proved was Radium bromatum.

148
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:47,271
So we have some symptomatology
 in the Materia Medica.

149
00:30:49,250 --> 00:31:06,250
What happens is when the results came out, who was the group that has the most close symptoms to Radium bromatum?

150
00:31:08,979 --> 00:31:12,885
-The placebo.

151
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:30,896
-No, those who took nothing. Those who took nothing imagined symptoms that were fitting

152
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,917
 more to the proving of Radium bromatum.

153
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:57,896
Do you realize the importance in all the Theory? Everything that we do is based upon the provings.

154
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:07,385
If the provings are done wrongly, if the information comes and it is hap hazard,

155
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:10,427
 it is mixed imagination and real information.

156
00:32:10,531 --> 00:32:20,271
Because out of the 50 people, most probably
 1 or 2 of them gave correct symptoms but who are the correct?

157
00:32:20,375 --> 00:32:28,250
How can you find out who are the correct and who are the misinformed, it's not possible.

158
00:32:28,354 --> 00:32:37,938
Because the leader says symptom, symptom, how do you find which is the correct one?

159
00:32:38,938 --> 00:32:48,385
And then you apply this and sometimes they say, the people who do these kind of provings,

160
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:57,875
they will say, 'but some people gave this
remedy and then there was a cure'.

161
00:32:57,979 --> 00:33:09,833
Of course there was a cure because we have what we call the placebo effect or they may have used

162
00:33:09,938 --> 00:33:21,167
1 or 2 symptoms of  the real proving out of
the 500 symptoms that they were false.

163
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:28,708
If I give you a remedy, everyone will bring symptoms to me, of course.

164
00:33:29,604 --> 00:33:37,938
But mostly probably 2 of you are sensitive to the remedy, that means your symptoms are the reliable ones.

165
00:33:38,042 --> 00:33:43,698
How do we find? Only through this
process of going first

166
00:33:43,802 --> 00:33:53,625
 and prove all the sub-toxic level and then proceed to higher and higher potencies.

167
00:33:53,729 --> 00:34:03,604
Otherwise, the information which will come
to be used by us, will be totally unreliable.

168
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:10,771
That's why I have decided in this course that
I will give you, out of all the remedies

169
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:19,323
which I'm teaching, the experience which
 I have that this type of symptoms

170
00:34:19,427 --> 00:34:32,354
are reliable in every remedy and you can
 use them with great confidence.

171
00:34:38,667 --> 00:34:42,677
-So they didn't know what remedy
they have been proving?

172
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:53,937
-No, nobody knew that it
was Radium bromatum.

173
00:34:54,135 --> 00:35:01,583
-But nevertheless they produced
symptoms, how is that possible?

174
00:35:01,688 --> 00:35:16,531
-You did not understand. There is another experiment, I had a problem with these provings.

175
00:35:17,292 --> 00:35:23,292
They proved Hydrogen and they brought
out a book with symptoms with Hydrogen.

176
00:35:23,396 --> 00:35:33,656
I said well, this is very strange because
first of all Hydrogen is a very volatile gas.

177
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:45,010
Hydrogen you cannot find it. The moment
it comes, it joins with Oxygen and

178
00:35:45,115 --> 00:35:49,979
an explosion and then there is water.

179
00:35:50,958 --> 00:36:07,063
Apart from that I said ok, the same thing that this group used and a group from Italian doctors came to do the proving.

180
00:36:12,427 --> 00:36:27,552
What happened is that the placebo and the group who took the remedy developed almost the same number of symptoms.

181
00:36:29,042 --> 00:36:40,708
There were 20 symptoms by the placebo group and 25, small difference, by the group who took the remedy.

182
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:54,417
None of these 25 were the characteristic symptoms of the Hydrogen that the other group was writing.

183
00:36:58,417 --> 00:37:06,042
So where is the truth? The truth is that depends on the imagination of the provers.

184
00:37:06,552 --> 00:37:18,000
They imagine symptoms and it depends on the interpretation of the symptoms by the leader.

185
00:37:21,396 --> 00:37:41,667
Oh you saw a dream that there was standing
 a ghost. So you have fear of ghosts.

186
00:37:42,375 --> 00:37:50,021
You saw a dream that your mother was standing next to you but the shape of the mother was not exactly;

187
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:58,281
I mean she was my mother but not as
I remember her. Ok, that is a fear of ghosts.

188
00:37:59,208 --> 00:38:11,865
It depends on the interpretation. In this way we have almost destroyed classical Homeopathy.

189
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:17,802
 So I consider this subject very very important.

190
00:38:19,115 --> 00:38:37,156
They told me, as I have said before, we potentise the Berlin wall. The wall that was built to separate Germany.

191
00:38:39,531 --> 00:38:51,292
I said what did you do? Did you take a little piece of the cement, you potentise it? They said, no.

192
00:38:52,083 --> 00:39:04,604
They said, 'we took a powder which we put it under the wall, we sat around and meditated'.

193
00:39:05,625 --> 00:39:17,667
I said, 'to whom do you prescribe this remedy?' They said, 'to those who want a divorce'.

194
00:39:27,135 --> 00:39:41,802
If a patient comes and say, 'I can't stand my husband', there is a desire to separate, Berlin wall !

195
00:39:49,531 --> 00:39:59,052
I mean this kind of noncsense is going on and it has to stop otherwise Homeopathy will go down the gutter

196
00:39:59,156 --> 00:40:07,479
and it will be disappearing and nobody will pay any attention anymore with all this crazyness

197
00:40:07,583 --> 00:40:14,333
which is coming up in
the picture of Homeopathy.

198
00:40:15,333 --> 00:40:20,792
What is scaring in me is that people
 do not react to this nonsense.

199
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:31,458
They think that these are new ideas, why don't we incorporate the ideas, creative ideas.

200
00:40:44,219 --> 00:40:50,031
-We have exact rules here in the
Organon about the way of proving.

201
00:40:50,135 --> 00:41:00,760
-Of course. But this is not followed and
also you have to know that provings,

202
00:41:00,865 --> 00:41:07,823
that means the information which is in the Materia Medica, comes from what?

203
00:41:08,604 --> 00:41:25,052
The first source is provings. The second source is toxicology, that means accidental,

204
00:41:25,156 --> 00:41:33,354
or intentional toxicity of subjects by the substance.

205
00:41:34,375 --> 00:41:47,292
And the third one, which is one of the most important sources, clinical cases.

206
00:41:55,250 --> 00:42:05,677
So the information in the Matera Medica comes from provings, we start with this, we add the toxicology

207
00:42:05,781 --> 00:42:18,313
if we can find it and then we apply and we see
 if in the clinical case, this remedy has affected the case.

208
00:42:18,417 --> 00:42:26,198
And which other symptoms have cured apart from the ones which we prescribe.

209
00:42:28,042 --> 00:42:36,094
And if there are some new symptoms which have been cured by that remedy, we note them down in a notebook.

210
00:42:36,865 --> 00:42:48,385
And then in next case we see according to
these symptoms we can prescribe and then,
if this is active,

211
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:59,198
 it happens that it cures then we may start thinking that these new symptoms belong to the remedy.

212
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:32,958
-Is it true that the most important point is the third? If is it proven several times that he remedy has helped in the clinic.

213
00:43:33,063 --> 00:43:36,000
Is this the most important?

214
00:43:36,312 --> 00:43:40,323
-You cannot say which this is the
most important, you cannot say.

215
00:43:40,427 --> 00:43:48,167
Sometimes important symptoms come from
this source, sometimes from that source.

216
00:43:58,531 --> 00:44:08,146
 The problem is that such information has
gone into the Materia Medica already.

217
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:32,583
Unreliable information and for instance one has proving of the Luna, of the light of the moon.

218
00:44:35,083 --> 00:44:41,323
This is nonsense, the light of the
moon cannot produce symptoms.

219
00:44:45,135 --> 00:44:56,802
A substance in order to cure it has to have the capacity to produce symptoms in the human organism.

220
00:44:56,906 --> 00:45:01,063
Otherwise it will not cure.

221
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:16,760
So the luna or the sun or the wind or the rain are physical phenomena that do not produce symptoms.

222
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:31,188
What they do, the physical phenomena, because our organisms, sometimes becomes deranged, even the sun,

223
00:45:31,292 --> 00:45:43,021
even the luna, because you are sick,
the wetness, the rain, the thunderstorm etc.

224
00:45:43,125 --> 00:45:47,646
all these physical phenomena
because you are deranged,

225
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:55,563
because the system is deranged then
it can react and produce some symptoms.

226
00:45:55,667 --> 00:46:06,021
He says, 'I don't feel well during
thunderstorm', ok we potentise the thunder

227
00:46:06,125 --> 00:46:10,583
and we give it to you and you
will be well, this is nonsense.

228
00:46:11,823 --> 00:46:23,958
'I'm not feeling well during the full moon'; this is true but this is because you are crazy,

229
00:46:24,063 --> 00:46:31,833
I mean you have a disturbance and therefore
 I have an eruption because of the exposure to the sun.

230
00:46:31,938 --> 00:46:37,917
Of course because your liver is not
working and therefore the sun etc.

231
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:50,094
When somebody says, 'I am worse in the sea', you don't potentize the sea. You give a different remedy

232
00:46:50,198 --> 00:47:02,365
which is worse in the sea. Of course the sea, because it contains a lot of elements it can produce;

233
00:47:02,469 --> 00:47:11,708
 if you go and drink 3 kilos of sea water what happens? Of course you will be sick.

234
00:47:17,667 --> 00:47:32,010
So I want to know if this is clear, if you have some questions. It depends how this proving was done.

235
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:39,344
If it was done with aqua marina, sea water,
first of all I don't know the proving.

236
00:47:39,448 --> 00:47:49,167
Secondly, if the proving is done properly
 then you can rely on such symptoms.

237
00:47:49,271 --> 00:47:58,802
If it is not done properly and it is done like
one high potency and meditation, forget it.

238
00:47:59,625 --> 00:48:11,979
As I said maybe some real symptoms are there but the majority of such symptoms are imagination of the provers.

239
00:48:14,938 --> 00:48:29,865
Which are the qualities of the provers as determined by Hahnemann, in which aphorism?

240
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:45,250
It's a pity that people who are willing and they spend time and energy, they don't do it properly

241
00:48:45,354 --> 00:48:52,729
so we can have reliable information.
It's a pity because you waste your time,

242
00:48:52,833 --> 00:49:00,375
energy and you inject a lot of
 misinformation into  the science.

243
00:49:08,292 --> 00:49:18,375
Please give me all your thoughts
and all your doubts to clarify the issue.

244
00:49:19,125 --> 00:49:27,708
-What about other impoderables like X-ray and Electricitas and the second point is, is sun

245
00:49:27,813 --> 00:49:38,354
also produces symptoms like sunburn.

246
00:49:38,458 --> 00:49:50,042
-What about other impoderables
 like X-ray and electricity?

247
00:49:52,625 --> 00:49:57,469
Ok, we take these two first to examine
and then we examine the sun.

248
00:49:59,167 --> 00:50:11,604
Now, how long you can stay under X-ray?
Half an hour and see what happens.

249
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:25,333
Of course X-rays have the possibility of producing symptoms in the human organism;

250
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:32,521
therefore X-ray can be a remedy,
if it is proven properly.

251
00:50:32,625 --> 00:50:48,188
Now how can we prove X-ray?
X-ray we do not need to prove on toxic level,

252
00:50:48,292 --> 00:50:53,271
because there is no actual toxic level
but we have the side effects.

253
00:50:53,375 --> 00:51:03,094
We have these cases recorded in the literature in Medicine which are the side effects of X-ray.

254
00:51:03,354 --> 00:51:16,688
From this we can start and have a guiding mind and of course, in such a case, we go to these people

255
00:51:16,792 --> 00:51:31,031
who were sensitive to the X-ray and we
invite them in an experiment with X-ray 200.

256
00:51:31,135 --> 00:51:37,021
Then you may really find some
 interesting symptoms to record.

257
00:51:37,125 --> 00:51:45,365
But unless you do that, go and find those people who are sensitive on the X-rays and then they had all these

258
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:54,438
problems and then you organize it, you cannot say, I give X-ray and see what happens.

259
00:51:54,542 --> 00:52:14,510
That's for X-ray, now for electricity.
If we have a big electrical transformer,

260
00:52:15,667 --> 00:52:31,250
a worker on a power house of electricity
and we have such cases.

261
00:52:32,708 --> 00:52:46,021
Since I'm working in this department inside the electromagnetic field of such power electrical generator,

262
00:52:46,125 --> 00:52:58,813
I am not feeling well. What do you have? 1,2,3, 20 symptoms, ok. Find those people who are sensitive

263
00:52:58,917 --> 00:53:11,563
to the electricity and then of course what you
 can do is leave the powder under this powerful generator

264
00:53:11,667 --> 00:53:23,271
for a period of time and then try to potentise
this and you give it and you see the result.

265
00:53:23,375 --> 00:53:37,167
So powerful electromagnetic field of electrical generators can produce symptoms to sensitive people.

266
00:53:37,271 --> 00:53:44,604
Find these people, do the experiment, give them the electricity and then find out and give us the results.

267
00:53:44,708 --> 00:53:52,760
But these are serious experiments which are bringing forward serious information, right?

268
00:53:54,250 --> 00:54:06,740
Now we go to the sun. The sun, if you sit in the sun from 9 o'clock in the morning without moving at all

269
00:54:06,844 --> 00:54:14,073
to 9 o'clock in the night,
lying in the sun and see what happens.

270
00:54:14,177 --> 00:54:28,375
That means first of all that you are crazy. By definition you are not well and the prover in order to do experiment,

271
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:38,188
one of the conditions, is that the prover has to be healthy, mentally, emotionally and physically.

272
00:54:38,292 --> 00:54:51,854
The second is, if you put somebody on a furnace then you burn him. Are you going to potentise the fire to cure him?

273
00:54:51,958 --> 00:55:08,844
So if heat is burning somebody you don't potentize the heat to cure him; neither you will have any effect of that.

274
00:55:11,833 --> 00:55:19,979
So potentising the sun is a crazy situation, potentising the luna is also crazy.

275
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:26,021
And I will tell you something.
I had a case on magnetic poles,

276
00:55:26,125 --> 00:55:35,250
 the south magnetic pole exactly
as it was described in the books.

277
00:55:35,354 --> 00:55:50,479
I said to the doctor, ok give South Magnetic Pole 200. It couldn't be a better case, as it was described.

278
00:55:50,583 --> 00:55:55,958
No effect at all, nothing.

279
00:55:58,250 --> 00:56:03,646
You will say there is a case which
 was cured and the case was cured.

280
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:13,938
In a previous seminar an Israeli doctor said to me, well what do you say about a case in which a medical doctor

281
00:56:14,042 --> 00:56:22,854
who had severe colities who went to several of his colleagues, nobody could cure him.

282
00:56:22,958 --> 00:56:34,292
Eventually he went to a Homeopath who took the case and prescribed a remedy and this is a published case.

283
00:56:36,208 --> 00:56:52,219
And the doctor was cured but, as he says, the patient claims, he never took the remedy.

284
00:56:56,250 --> 00:57:12,063
So out of this experience the idea came that you may have to only think about the remedy, you don't have to give it.

285
00:57:12,167 --> 00:57:16,458
You just think about the remedy and the patient
 is cured.

286
00:57:20,375 --> 00:57:28,385
 That is another nonsense and another
thing which degrades the science.

287
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:38,604
In order that this man can justify why the person became well after the consultation, he said,

288
00:57:38,708 --> 00:57:43,052
I thought of the correct remedy
and he became well.

289
00:57:43,156 --> 00:57:50,583
And he brings a theory out and
everybody believes that this is true.

290
00:57:50,688 --> 00:58:04,167
But what actually happens is that in many many cases, what we have as Homeopaths, we have the placebo effect.

291
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:16,979
The remedy does nothing and the placebo effect comes and the patient says, I'm better. We cannot ignore that.

292
00:58:17,667 --> 00:58:28,333
And we have some rules to know whether the remedy has acted or not. We have rules in the Homeopathy.

293
00:58:29,917 --> 00:58:40,146
-The question is that if we are talking about the X-ray remedy, which way we bring this influence of the X-ray

294
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:46,188
to the patient? By sugar balls which
undergo, by salt balls or whatever.

295
00:58:46,292 --> 00:58:53,813
I mean it's impossible to take X-ray equipment, shake it 10 times, then take 10 times smaller

296
00:58:53,917 --> 00:59:09,469
 and then bring to the patient. The question is if there is any study about which substance is used for the remedies?

297
00:59:10,792 --> 00:59:24,365
-These are legitimate questions for such cases, but the first thing that comes to mind is that you can expose

298
00:59:24,469 --> 00:59:36,583
a powder to the influence of the X-ray and take this powder and potentize it several times.

299
00:59:36,625 --> 00:59:47,740
Most probably you will have a potentised X-ray remedy but, as you say, there are several issues

300
00:59:47,844 --> 00:59:53,833
that have to be examined
all along in such experience.

301
00:59:53,875 --> 01:00:04,813
But what I say is let us become serious about it. You cannot say I will give you a remedy, all of you,

302
01:00:04,917 --> 01:00:14,229
you go and sleep and bring me tomorrow the dreams that you saw. And because you saw several dreams,

303
01:00:14,333 --> 01:00:30,208
 I take this as produced by the remedy, that is nonsense. It might be 1 person or 2 or 3 but who are those 3, nobody knows.

304
01:00:30,792 --> 01:00:40,521
All the other is nonsense. And many times they say, this group who took the remedy had the same dream

305
01:00:40,625 --> 01:00:44,698
as the other group who did not take the remedy.

306
01:00:44,802 --> 01:00:55,844
That is a proof that the symptoms were true for the remedy? Absolutely no. The opposite.

307
01:00:56,250 --> 01:01:13,125
It is true that the dreams that you saw is because of the climate, a general factor that influences  the people.

308
01:01:15,792 --> 01:01:24,458
-What do you think about the smelling of remedies? To just smell at the bottle?

309
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:33,667
-I've never done it so I don't know.

310
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:41,625
-How far can we extend the Materia Medica?

311
01:01:43,125 --> 01:01:49,031
-That's a good question. I am supposed
to be a very successful prescriber.

312
01:01:49,135 --> 01:01:57,063
At least when I came in Athens and I was prescribing, because I did not prescribe on

313
01:01:57,167 --> 01:02:06,021
already spoiled cases from Homeopaths, as
I do now, now I prescribe on spoiled cases by different Homeopaths.

314
01:02:06,125 --> 01:02:12,896
When I was prescribing originally,
the rate of success was very high.

315
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:22,417
I did not need more remedies than what we already had in the Materia Medica and I could say that even it was too much.

316
01:02:23,552 --> 01:02:36,771
Now, because of the lack of basic information about the remedies, the practitioner found himself in a total mess.

317
01:02:36,875 --> 01:02:43,188
What shall I do? I don't know.
Ok, let me try this and let me try that.

318
01:02:43,292 --> 01:02:56,667
In a quiz which I wrote in the first European journal it was a case that needed Pulsatilla.

319
01:02:57,458 --> 01:03:14,708
About 12 people wrote to me that most probably the remedy was Luna. Then I become aware of the problem.

320
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:24,458
12 people, out of I don't remember how
 many total answers we received,

321
01:03:24,542 --> 01:03:33,917
12 people wrote this is a case of Luna,
but this was a case of Pulsatilla.

322
01:03:50,375 --> 01:04:04,354
-Regarding the provings of electricity you say that you have to find the person who is sensitive.

323
01:04:04,458 --> 01:04:11,354
One of the important things is that you don't know what you are proving when you are proving.

324
01:04:11,458 --> 01:04:14,500
So how does that go together?

325
01:04:14,604 --> 01:04:20,917
How do we know in advance who is going to be sensitive to radioactive substances?

326
01:04:21,021 --> 01:04:26,042
The provers will know what they are going to get.

327
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:47,771
-What I say is, concerning the impoderables.
 For instance you want to do a study on Radium bromatum

328
01:04:47,875 --> 01:04:55,104
or Radium or I don't know in Chernobyl
what was the radioactive substance.

329
01:04:55,208 --> 01:05:05,979
In Chernobyl you'll find out that they were people already dying, the most sensitive. Not all the population died.

330
01:05:06,083 --> 01:05:10,542
So the most sensitive developed
symptoms immediately.

331
01:05:10,646 --> 01:05:20,385
What I'm saying is, go and find these people who are sensitive and give them a high potency,

332
01:05:20,490 --> 01:05:30,104
to these people on  these cases of the imponderables, then you can find out.

333
01:05:30,208 --> 01:05:42,667
The second thing I said is that, if you prove any remedy which has some toxicity then what you can do is you say,

334
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:52,542
take sub-toxic doses, you develop
symptoms, get out and first in the list.

335
01:05:52,646 --> 01:05:57,208
Then second in the list, third
 in the list, the rest forget it, out.

336
01:05:57,313 --> 01:06:08,958
Those first in the list who are very sensitive,
they do not know what they are taking yet.

337
01:06:09,063 --> 01:06:15,938
Then second step, take higher potency;
still they don't know what they are taking.

338
01:06:16,042 --> 01:06:23,115
Third step, take another potency;
and then get all the information possible.

339
01:06:23,219 --> 01:06:25,844
Is it clear? Ok.

340
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:36,448
-My question is to know if you really think that it is necessary to extend the Materia Medica and
 I explain why.

341
01:06:36,552 --> 01:06:44,771
I've been told that somebody like Lippe was an extraordinary prescriber who practically

342
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:58,896
never failed to cure any of his patients. If it's true or not, I don't know. The Materia Medica at the time was sufficient

343
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:07,917
to cure whatever has to be cured. So do you think there is a need today to extend the Materia Medica or not?

344
01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:24,146
-For me a very useful experiment will be to go to what we have already as small remedies in the Materia Medica

345
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:33,813
and improve the information on these remedies. Find out mostly what they can produce in mental, emotional levels.

346
01:07:33,917 --> 01:07:49,563
This is a very interesting for me experiment.
 Now given the fact that most of the successful practitioners

347
01:07:49,667 --> 01:08:08,063
do not really need all these extraterrestrial remedies, then we have to say, well the Materia Medica is already enough.

348
01:08:08,083 --> 01:08:15,146
But it can be improved and we must not stop that. I don't want to stop the proving.

349
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:22,187
I want to rehabilitate those who are doing provings and do the provings properly.

350
01:08:22,292 --> 01:08:27,271
And then I will be very happy.
Now I am very unhappy.

351
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:34,187
Because they invite me at the University, in Bonn University actually they invited me there and they said

352
01:08:34,292 --> 01:08:45,146
'what is going on with your profession?'. We hear this, this and that, is it true? Do you believe these things?

353
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:48,719
I said, no for godshake, this is nonsence.

354
01:08:48,823 --> 01:08:59,812
And this information you have to understand that it goes right through the planet and everyone knows what is going on.

355
01:08:59,917 --> 01:09:07,167
And everyone is organizing, the other people on the other side, which is the pharmaceutical companies and the

356
01:09:07,271 --> 01:09:14,604
Medical establishment are organizing themselves and they take this information and say, look at them.

357
01:09:14,708 --> 01:09:20,000
Are they serious people that
you can trust to cure people?

358
01:09:21,042 --> 01:09:28,677
And this is my problem because
 I get the feedback, I get the impact.

359
01:09:28,781 --> 01:09:32,354
They come to me and say, what are you doing?

360
01:09:34,094 --> 01:09:43,500
-I have one more question about X-ray. There is no doubt that X-ray has toxical effect if you get
 X-ray.

361
01:09:43,510 --> 01:09:56,188
But I doubt if what I do is to produce a remedy that I put a powder under X-ray. And I think you could eat kilograms

362
01:09:56,292 --> 01:10:09,427
of this powder without getting any symptoms,
so I doubt about the real value of the way you produce the remedy.

363
01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:21,646
-But in this case, of X-ray, I say that the sub-toxic dose is the dose which you take when you let
 yourself

364
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:29,677
under X-ray under certain time, because it can
become very toxic, as anything else.

365
01:10:29,781 --> 01:10:42,938
But sub-toxic means that this organism can
stay for 3 seconds, this is a sub-toxic dose.

366
01:10:43,042 --> 01:10:50,813
And you get people, if you search in the
hospital and the X-ray departments,

367
01:10:50,917 --> 01:10:59,094
 you will get some people who are starting
to be sick after being exposed to X-rays.

368
01:10:59,198 --> 01:11:10,563
In these people we are interested, we find them and then we potentize the powder, not the powder as it is like this.

369
01:11:10,667 --> 01:11:18,292
I don't think it will be active at all but if you potentise this powder I believe that it can cure

370
01:11:18,396 --> 01:11:23,729
and also in certain sensitive
individuals can produce symptoms.

371
01:11:24,542 --> 01:11:32,760
-Yes but this is a bit strange to me if you say, the powder is not active but if you potentise it, it will be active.

372
01:11:36,063 --> 01:11:53,583
-Ok, it's strange but I will give you another example. You make a powder of gold or stone and you take it.

373
01:11:54,427 --> 01:12:12,094
It will come out. Don't powder very fine, make little pieces of gold and take them. It will come out.

374
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:25,625
Make little pieces of powder of stone, of sand but potentise it and make silica, then it will have an effect.

375
01:12:26,271 --> 01:12:35,521
You take a lot of plants that are not open,
what we call open in their medicinal powers

376
01:12:35,625 --> 01:12:40,271
when they are in the first stage.

377
01:12:41,312 --> 01:12:50,719
In the same way, a lot of other chemicals
maybe they are not affecting at all

378
01:12:50,823 --> 01:12:55,313
but if you potentise them,
then they become very effective.

379
01:12:56,792 --> 01:12:59,438
-I suppose that we come here
to a very interesting point;

380
01:12:59,542 --> 01:13:03,938
we need the definition of homeopathic
remedy, what is this?

381
01:13:04,042 --> 01:13:12,698
Because in that case like we are talking about this effect produced by X-rays, I'm sure it depends on

382
01:13:12,802 --> 01:13:20,583
which substance undergoes by X-rays.
So if this is sugar, that will be one effect.

383
01:13:20,688 --> 01:13:26,469
I really doubt that it would be the same
effect with undergo salt or whatever.

384
01:13:26,573 --> 01:13:36,708
So here is what will be the definition of homeopathic remedy which you can give us?

385
01:13:37,708 --> 01:13:45,146
I can't imagine the way how we can pass to the people the influence which is produced by some

386
01:13:45,250 --> 01:13:56,406
electromagnetic vibration or fields or whatever.
 If we do it through some substances then we
 are talking

387
01:13:56,510 --> 01:14:05,521
about the effect which produced by some substances which will undergo some influences

388
01:14:05,625 --> 01:14:10,813
 of these fields, electromagnetic,
gravitational or strong electromagnetic

389
01:14:10,917 --> 01:14:21,073
like we can put it in physical accelerators.
This is the first question, what is the definition of homeopathic remedy?

390
01:14:21,177 --> 01:14:28,188
And the second is, is it worth while for us to spend so much time for these substances,

391
01:14:28,292 --> 01:14:34,135
for these homeopathic remedies, which
 probably can be used for such extreme cases,

392
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:43,885
 like Chernobyl or some others. 99 % which
we have in our daily practice is far from that.

393
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:54,344
-Well this is the same question as it was put before. Is it necessary to have all these new remedies produced?

394
01:14:54,448 --> 01:15:07,229
I have stated already my opinion. But it is true also, electricity for instance it has cured, at least
I have heard

395
01:15:07,333 --> 01:15:18,396
of 2 cases that have been cured, cases which work under strong electromagnetic fields and with the high potency

396
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:30,375
 of electricity everything was fine. Now, was it a placebo effect or was it really electricity also, I do not know.

397
01:15:31,417 --> 01:15:38,875
My interest will be to use X-ray potency in cases where they have been damaged by X-ray.

398
01:15:38,979 --> 01:15:49,563
Interesting will be in Chernobyl to use high potency of Radium bromatum or the substance that was released there,

399
01:15:49,667 --> 01:15:56,729
on high potency, to have an idea of how
many people they maybe benefited.

400
01:15:56,833 --> 01:16:19,042
At this moment there is a big problem on universal level concerning the people who were in the Gulf war.

401
01:16:21,135 --> 01:16:26,781
Some of the soldiers, the Americans and the English, they developed a host of symptomatology

402
01:16:26,885 --> 01:16:36,917
and there is a big argument what is there, what has happened. Why these soldiers develop these symptoms?

403
01:16:37,667 --> 01:16:53,063
My opinion is that the vaccination that was given to them to protect them from possible exposure to chemicals,

404
01:16:53,167 --> 01:17:03,719
the vaccination produced such a turmoil in the immune system that brought out a syndrome,

405
01:17:03,823 --> 01:17:15,625
that means it's a massive proving of this particular vaccination which I don't know how they produced it.

406
01:17:15,729 --> 01:17:30,063
But it's very interesting that the French soldiers that were also in the Gulf war, they were not developing these symptoms.

407
01:17:30,167 --> 01:17:41,677
Which is a proof that definitely those who took the vaccination were affected, not the exposure from gases,

408
01:17:41,781 --> 01:17:50,896
as they want to make it or the imagination of the soldiers as others want to make it. It's a big issue,

409
01:17:51,000 --> 01:18:01,563
there is a lot of money involved because they will demand for damages and they try to cover up the issue.

410
01:18:01,667 --> 01:18:11,292
The issue is very clear for me. You gave vaccination, these people developed, and not all of them,

411
01:18:11,396 --> 01:18:22,896
 those who are sensitive, it is an 8% percentage that developed these symptoms.

412
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:32,521
Of course it will be interesting, in this case, to give a high dose of the same substance to see how many

413
01:18:32,625 --> 01:18:40,250
of these, I believe a 10% out of this, will be
very much ameliorated by a higher potency;

414
01:18:40,354 --> 01:18:46,208
the others will need a homeopathic treatment.

415
01:18:47,781 --> 01:19:00,292
-I would like to say something to the Chernobyl. You said those who died or got sick were sensitive to the rays,

416
01:19:00,396 --> 01:19:07,313
but I think they also got higher doses.
 If you give high dose to someone, he will die anyway;

417
01:19:07,417 --> 01:19:11,604
I don't think he has to be sensitive.

418
01:19:13,667 --> 01:19:25,229
-That is correct for those who died immediately that is correct. But still after 10 years we still have the effect

419
01:19:25,333 --> 01:19:33,000
of the Chernobyl and people are going to live for 20 more years with the effect of the Chernobyl.

420
01:19:37,219 --> 01:19:52,698
-She asked if there is effect by smelling and you said, you don't know. But if we are talking about crystals

421
01:19:52,802 --> 01:20:03,031
or the remedies of Bach flowers, they even
 have an affect only by wearing them.

422
01:20:03,135 --> 01:20:09,271
And this means the effect is by vibrations and when we are talking about homeopathic potency of 200,

423
01:20:15,667 --> 01:20:20,875
 they don't cure on physical level,
they cure even by vibrations.

424
01:20:22,198 --> 01:20:24,729
-I don't deny that.

425
01:20:24,833 --> 01:20:32,104
-I want to know if you have incorporate the globulis or if you just can wear them on your pocket,

426
01:20:32,208 --> 01:20:38,719
 if there is already the effect
by the vibrations that come from the globulis.

427
01:20:38,823 --> 01:20:58,323
-Well, I believe Hahnemann was saying, you can rub the liquid remedy in arm pits or in sensitive areas of the skin.

428
01:20:58,427 --> 01:21:12,073
That also I can understand, we also agree
that these remedies act on vibrational level

429
01:21:13,469 --> 01:21:20,854
but the vibration has to come
very close to the person.

430
01:21:20,958 --> 01:21:29,896
Otherwise we have to accept that those working in the  homeopathic pharmaceutical companies,

431
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:41,396
are exposed to thousands of remedies. If you imagine that this room is full of 3000 remedies

432
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:44,813
 and I work all the day,
opening and closing bottles.

433
01:21:44,917 --> 01:21:51,885
And that I would be affected;
this I don't believe, I'm sorry.

434
01:21:53,667 --> 01:22:04,031
I believe that in order to be affected you have
 to come in real contact; either with the mucus membranes

435
01:22:04,135 --> 01:22:11,917
or the sensitive parts of the skin. Mucus membranes of course is the best.

436
01:22:22,177 --> 01:22:33,031
-May I say something to this Chernobyl problem? I made an experience with a group of colleagues.

437
01:22:33,135 --> 01:22:44,854
We treated Chernobyl children. They came for vacations to Bavaria and we had about 10 children

438
01:22:44,958 --> 01:22:56,771
and we thought now we need those great radioactive remedies and we didn't need one of them at all.

439
01:22:56,875 --> 01:23:02,667
  Then we went to Russia, we treated them again.

440
01:23:03,667 --> 01:23:10,188
-You treated them according to the symptoms which required other remedies.

441
01:23:10,292 --> 01:23:19,812
-We had only normal remedies, and when we went to Russia it was the same. We didn't find one child,

442
01:23:19,917 --> 01:23:30,271
even those in the hospital who need one radioactive remedy. This was for us a big lesson

443
01:23:30,375 --> 01:23:37,688
that people react like everywhere.
They don't react in a radioactive way.

444
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:49,427
-That is correct and we agree and I say that even if there is some effect, your observation is limited.

445
01:23:49,531 --> 01:23:55,271
You cannot generalize and say that nobody will need Radium bromatum you cannot say that.

446
01:23:55,375 --> 01:24:02,448
So some people, most probably will need Radium bromatum and maybe it will be a substantial number,

447
01:24:02,552 --> 01:24:09,771
 maybe 3-5% up to 10%,
as I said with the vaccination.

448
01:24:11,448 --> 01:24:21,719
But as a matter of interest I said this on the vaccination issue, give the high potency and most probably

449
01:24:21,823 --> 01:24:31,427
you will see some of them getting out. But the majority of them, 90-95% they will have no effect

450
01:24:31,531 --> 01:24:38,292
and they will need another remedy. The observation is correct but we cannot generalize

451
01:24:38,396 --> 01:24:47,469
and say none needs because
 you have not treated everyone.

452
01:25:00,802 --> 01:25:09,208
-Excuse me I don't know great deal about the Materia Medica but gases can cause toxicity.

453
01:25:11,135 --> 01:25:20,760
If someone is poisoned by gas. I don't know
what is taken to counteract that effect.

454
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:30,677
-Always you have to take the symptoms of the person at the moment. With the same gas, people

455
01:25:30,781 --> 01:25:45,563
will develop different symptoms. Of course dyspnoea and some common burns etc.

456
01:25:45,667 --> 01:25:55,500
but the modalities of each one of them will be different so you need to search to give the indicated remedy.

457
01:25:55,604 --> 01:25:58,563
-You don't have to cool the gas
and make a material?

458
01:25:58,667 --> 01:26:11,115
-Well you can do that as well but small percentage will be affected. It's like an epidemic exactly.

459
01:26:13,271 --> 01:26:25,583
In epidemic you see Gelsemium in 10-15% of the cases, but the rest have to be treated by other remedies.

460
01:26:40,198 --> 01:26:48,385
-George, there is a remedy, I want to have your opinion about it, which we use on a very big scale in France

461
01:26:48,490 --> 01:27:02,677
called Oscillococcinum This is prescribed for anybody to prevent or to cure a cold in winter and it really works,

462
01:27:02,781 --> 01:27:12,385
 the prove is that the laboratory that makes it,
it's selling 32million boxes every winter;

463
01:27:12,490 --> 01:27:21,771
 so it has an effect and apparently the action is because there is a lot of amino-acid inside the remedy

464
01:27:21,875 --> 01:27:30,135
and it boosts the immune system. What is your opinion about that? It's contrary to classical Homoeopathy.

465
01:27:31,417 --> 01:27:40,208
-When I tried to use it, it had no effect but this is my personal experience. So I don't know.

466
01:27:40,312 --> 01:27:51,781
I would need really the experience, if we want
to test, such a general medicine, then I would need

467
01:27:51,885 --> 01:28:01,333
 the experience of 10 serious and very important Homeopaths in 10 different countries.

468
01:28:02,292 --> 01:28:08,313
And then I would say, ok you give
 it and tell me the feedback.

469
01:28:10,042 --> 01:28:18,063
Unless I do this kind of experimentation
I will not be able to make a statement.

470
01:28:23,427 --> 01:28:37,052
-When you arrange a proving, sometimes you meet people that are too sensitive and they react almost to each remedy.

471
01:28:37,156 --> 01:28:41,792
Are they good prover or not?

472
01:28:42,802 --> 01:28:57,813
-They are good for you but not for them. If you find these people, but you find them seldom. In the experience

473
01:28:57,917 --> 01:29:04,719
of a person like me I have thousands and thousands of cases, I could say

474
01:29:04,823 --> 01:29:15,604
 10 cases in my life that had this quality.
 They are sensitive organisms,

475
01:29:15,708 --> 01:29:25,167
quite hyponchondrial in their nature and they are very observant of the least change in their organism.

476
01:29:25,271 --> 01:29:31,656
And then everytime you give a remedy they give you back the characteristic symptoms of the remedy

477
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:38,052
that you've given and you say, oh my god ! Then you try again and again, they are very difficult cases

478
01:29:38,156 --> 01:29:49,542
to cure as Kent says but very good subjects for proving a remedy. Usually such cases will give you 1 or 2

479
01:29:49,646 --> 01:29:57,229
main symptoms of the remedy, they will not
give you host of symptoms or new symptoms.

480
01:29:57,333 --> 01:30:01,146
Very very seldom they'll give you new symptoms.
