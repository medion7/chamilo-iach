1
00:00:47,292 --> 00:00:56,906
It is a very great pleasure for me to address you tonight and I also feel that it is a special moment.

2
00:01:01,865 --> 00:01:12,552
A moment in the development of Homeopathic movement which is very important for the whole world.

3
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:26,573
I don't think that a few years ago if anybody was hearing to speak of Homeopathy and collect as many people as they

4
00:01:27,927 --> 00:01:40,885
are here tonight;  that's a sign that the time is now for Homeopathy.

5
00:01:49,688 --> 00:02:04,844
Tonight I have come to share with you some of my experiences concerning the human health in general, which I must say

6
00:02:06,052 --> 00:02:10,885
are not very optimistic.

7
00:02:16,104 --> 00:02:46,573
We are living in a time where there is a lot of excitement and the great technogical progress that promises to give us a lot

8
00:02:48,135 --> 00:03:03,083
and promises to give us the possibility to live in abundance and happiness.

9
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:29,417
Well my concern is that it is doubtful whether or not we will, in the course of few decades possess an adequate state of health to fully enjoy

10
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:34,510
the fruits of our technological progress.

11
00:03:36,865 --> 00:03:50,917
Why do I say that? Many of you may know that I have been directing a clinic in Athens where about 30 medical doctors are

12
00:03:51,958 --> 00:04:00,573
practicing full time in which we see about 2.000 patients every month.

13
00:04:01,865 --> 00:04:05,135
We don't see these patients casually.

14
00:04:08,823 --> 00:04:24,885
We take the thorough history of their medical past and we watch them as we keep them on and on in the years.

15
00:04:28,552 --> 00:04:38,292
As we attended all these thousands of cases and have seen how they react to different ways of treatment

16
00:04:38,396 --> 00:04:51,417
I come to the conclusion that the human health in general is in great hazard, in great danger.

17
00:05:00,354 --> 00:05:12,354
And my conclusion is that the health of the human race is rapidly degenerated.

18
00:05:13,667 --> 00:05:21,667
Ten years ago during several of my lectures at the Athenian School of Homeopathic Medicine

19
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:26,927
I suggested, as a consequence of my convictions,

20
00:05:27,854 --> 00:05:41,333
that soon the human organisms will develop a susceptibility to previously unrecognized violent infectious agents.

21
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:53,010
In less than 10 years, this prediction has regrettably began to be realized.

22
00:05:55,344 --> 00:06:14,333
Legionaries diseases and a host of others new infectious diseases with the recent breaking up

23
00:06:15,354 --> 00:06:25,688
of the disease which is called AIDS, and acquire deficiency of the immune system.

24
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:35,063
All these new diseases are breaking out, which means that the human body is opening up,

25
00:06:38,927 --> 00:06:49,354
is exposing itself to new agents that were unknown before.

26
00:06:53,802 --> 00:07:02,177
They were there but the human body had a protection and now this protection has been broken down.

27
00:07:07,646 --> 00:07:17,615
This new susceptibility to infectious agents is however only the tip of the iceberg.

28
00:07:19,104 --> 00:07:31,042
The deterioration of the collective health of mankind is far more perversive than this and it's reflected more dramatically

29
00:07:33,594 --> 00:07:36,510
in the relentless progression of chronic diseases.

30
00:07:39,271 --> 00:07:52,000
Serious chronic diseases affect tens of millions of people and the incidence steadily increases, even more in our juvenile population.

31
00:07:53,531 --> 00:08:05,490
Diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, cancer, epilepsy, heart diseases, allergic conditions, bronchial asthma, multiple

32
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:17,188
sclerosis and all the neuro-muscular diseases and serious chronic mental disorders are today alarmingly increasing.

33
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:30,083
I would anticipate that we are one to take a census.

34
00:08:31,906 --> 00:08:43,469
It would be discovered that we, of the entire population over 20 years of age of our industrialized countries, are taking some kind

35
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,875
of medicine for some chronic disturbance.

36
00:08:57,552 --> 00:09:12,729
I want just to give you an incident which was related a few months ago, where we have been treated a person with phobic state.

37
00:09:15,063 --> 00:09:35,375
He was very reluctant to say, to confess his fears. Eventually we make him tell all his fears. And he said to us, a few years ago

38
00:09:36,917 --> 00:09:49,021
it would be impossible to talk about all that, but lately it has happened an event which made me more possible to speak about my

39
00:09:49,198 --> 00:10:00,667
fears and phobias. Why? Because I was on the American Express, he says, and some lady, there were a lot of people inside.

40
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:14,698
Some lady fainted and to my amazing, he says, I saw almost everybody in American Express, in Athens rushing out taking some

41
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:20,958
kind of pills from their pockets and give them to the lady that has fallen down.

42
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:31,104
 I was amazed if so many people are taking pills, I thought I was the only one!

43
00:10:35,031 --> 00:10:45,531
And having these panic fears where he was almost in the point of fainting and taking all these pills, he felt he did very secretly.

44
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,490
Well this is a grotesque example of what is happening today as far as health is concerned.

45
00:11:00,271 --> 00:11:10,979
I just want to give you very quickly a few numbers in statistics which come from the National Health Service from this country.

46
00:11:13,021 --> 00:11:24,531
The statistics say that malignant neoplasms from 1961-73, these 12 years, have increased almost 50 %.

47
00:11:26,906 --> 00:11:34,927
50% in 10 years, in 100 years what happens?

48
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:44,552
The heart diseases have increased 54%.

49
00:11:45,573 --> 00:11:49,021
The nervous system diseases, 36%.

50
00:11:50,552 --> 00:11:53,260
Circulatory system, 24%.

51
00:11:54,531 --> 00:11:56,813
Muscular-skeleton system, 36%.

52
00:11:58,104 --> 00:12:13,010
You see all these diseases which I referred to, they are serious chronic conditions exploding.

53
00:12:14,063 --> 00:12:28,625
Gastro-intestinal conditions, gastritis which is something which is not severe, has increased only 4%. That is normal figure.

54
00:12:35,156 --> 00:12:46,344
If the general health of the human body was stable in a way, 4% or 5%, up to 10%,

55
00:12:47,906 --> 00:12:53,396
up and down but some figures are extremely high.

56
00:12:57,292 --> 00:13:01,708
Where are we going?

57
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:16,552
These examples are illustrations of the undeniable truth that our society's health is deteriorating.

58
00:13:20,271 --> 00:13:29,646
And it is especially interesting to know that rising incidents of chronic diseases and the appearance of new diseases

59
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:46,021
are occurring primarily in the industrialized countries of the West which paradoxically provide the people with the greatest

60
00:13:48,104 --> 00:13:54,885
access to orthodox medical treatment.

61
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:09,823
Thus one can arrive at one of both possible conclusions. That the order of health of the human population is deteriorating either because

62
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,417
of the employment of allopathic therapeutics or in spite of its use.

63
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:36,979
Certainly there must be many factors counting for the rising of chronic diseases and the increased stress in daily life in industrialized society,

64
00:14:39,271 --> 00:14:46,531
nutritional inadequacies in our diet, environmental toxics in which we have plant ourselves.

65
00:14:48,760 --> 00:15:03,750
But it remains my contention that our health is being compromised to great extend by the wide spread of allopathic drugging and effect.

66
00:15:11,438 --> 00:15:21,844
Well, this is perhaps an assumption. This is perhaps something that you cannot take it for granted.

67
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:31,906
Tonight I would like together to go  through certain concepts that I hope eventually to be able to show to you logically

68
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:41,531
that what I have said so far, is true.

69
00:15:54,552 --> 00:16:04,708
To understand what is happening we have to understand what is that we call a human organism.

70
00:16:13,354 --> 00:16:16,448
What is the human being?

71
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:24,688
Is it the physical body? Is only the senses?

72
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:33,771
To my understanding the human being can be said to function in 3 different levels.

73
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:42,104
On a mental level, on an emotional level and on physical level.

74
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:50,958
Now immediately we have a different concept of the human being.

75
00:16:54,854 --> 00:17:10,156
Maybe the concept that the human being is just pieces of cells or flesh is not very valid anymore, in our understanding.

76
00:17:13,802 --> 00:17:18,198
What is the mental level? It's very simple.

77
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:26,021
I will give you first a generic definition.

78
00:17:27,865 --> 00:17:42,667
The mental level is that part in us that registers alterations in our understanding or consciousness.

79
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:57,823
The emotional part is that which registers alterations in emotions.

80
00:18:02,687 --> 00:18:11,958
I'll give you certain functions of the mental level, you see the thinking process. When we classify, when we criticize,

81
00:18:15,573 --> 00:18:33,865
when we compare, when we calculate, when we create and conceive ideas or synthesize these ideas, we are working primarily on mental level.

82
00:18:34,979 --> 00:18:52,958
So there is a mental-spiritual part in the human body which can said to function at a certain moment and the human being

83
00:18:53,729 --> 00:19:01,292
as a whole focuses its function on that level.

84
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:18,979
And then there is the emotional level, what it contains?

85
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:42,333
All the degrees of emotions, from love to hate, from joy to sadness, from calmness to anxiety, from trust to mistrust, from courage to fear etc.

86
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:53,260
All these fine emotions are contained and they are interplaying in us; they are happening in the emotional level.

87
00:19:55,104 --> 00:20:00,042
We cannot say,  we don't have emotions, we only have cells

88
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:04,667
We cannot say, we don't have thinking, we only have cells.
