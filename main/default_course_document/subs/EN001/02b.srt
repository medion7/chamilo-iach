1
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:36,250
So today I think we shall be talking in the morning about the human being.

2
00:00:37,844 --> 00:00:46,563
From the point of view that we are concerned,
 of health and disease and what actually

3
00:00:46,667 --> 00:00:55,958
happens, what actually takes place
within a human being.

4
00:00:58,844 --> 00:01:10,562
In Homeopathy we're using new terms and
new understanding of the human being.

5
00:01:10,667 --> 00:01:15,740
I don't say human body, I don't say
human mind; I say human being.

6
00:01:15,844 --> 00:01:33,229
Human being is something which is
constructed from different parts and all these

7
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:47,156
they're maintained together with what
I would call cosmic energy,

8
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:53,667
that animates everything that
 goes through everything.

9
00:01:58,865 --> 00:02:13,271
And this is not a theory; it is something
which is tangible. There is something

10
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:24,313
which is beyond the human body,
the physical body and unless

11
00:02:24,417 --> 00:02:36,313
we have this understanding we
 cannot be real healers.

12
00:02:37,354 --> 00:02:45,760
We must know where we aim at.
What do we want to accomplish

13
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:51,740
when we see a patient who comes to us.
He says I have this problem and

14
00:02:51,844 --> 00:02:55,646
we give a remedy.
What do we want to accomplish?

15
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:03,063
 These are crucial questions that
we have to be clear about.

16
00:03:04,594 --> 00:03:15,771
The three parts of the human being as we
 have been talking about in a kind of hierarchy.

17
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:36,208
Let's go to the physical. Low down in the hierarchy is the skin and then the muscles,

18
00:03:36,313 --> 00:03:43,479
the bone structure, the kidneys,
 the lungs. You see we have two lungs,

19
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:49,104
one can be taken away and we can
survive. The same with the kidneys.

20
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:55,385
The liver, if the liver goes away most
 probably we'll not survive.

21
00:03:55,490 --> 00:04:06,646
The endocrine glands which take into consideration the pineal gland and

22
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:15,469
all these deep glands and then the heart
and then the brain on top of the organism.

23
00:04:18,573 --> 00:04:31,542
So we know from experience that if something happens to the heart, a scratch to the heart,

24
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:41,792
 it might be fatal, a scratch on the
 skin it means nothing.

25
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:50,521
The organs which are more high in the
 hierarchy are more protected also.

26
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:58,188
The skin is the least protected but
the brain is within a scalp;

27
00:04:58,292 --> 00:05:01,813
all around there is the scalp,
we cannot reach the brain.

28
00:05:01,917 --> 00:05:08,802
The heart is also protected,
the liver perhaps a little bit less.

29
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:19,521
So in this idea of hierarchy, we just
show the idea that there is a kind of

30
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:34,510
hierarchy in importance. That is going
to be a major part in our understanding.

31
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:52,188
We're learning that the brain is the highest.
 This is quite easy for you to understand,

32
00:05:52,292 --> 00:06:06,823
 is that correct? Is it easy for you to
understand that in the emotional part of our

33
00:06:06,927 --> 00:06:21,208
being, there are also organs, organs
of the psyche, psychic organs.

34
00:06:21,313 --> 00:06:31,938
Which are in a hierarchical order;
the organ which concerns with depression

35
00:06:32,042 --> 00:06:46,229
 is very very serious and is protected
 mostly. The organ that concerns with

36
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:54,563
disatisfaction is outside and takes the impact,
 like the skin takes the impact on this.

37
00:06:54,667 --> 00:07:00,844
 It takes the impact so we're
easily disatisfied.

38
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:12,375
 Your wife got up and did not
prepare breakfast for you.

39
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:18,333
You're disatisfied but you don't
 go to depression, right?

40
00:07:25,021 --> 00:07:41,313
And then you see irritability.
How easily we're irritated but the organ

41
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:51,063
that concerns with irritability
is on a low hierarchy.

42
00:07:52,906 --> 00:08:02,938
Then we go anxieties. Anxieties go
inside more and then we reach the

43
00:08:03,042 --> 00:08:14,760
phobias which are even deeper. Then
finally we reach the suicidal depression

44
00:08:14,865 --> 00:08:25,688
 that means an organ that maintains life and keeps hold and does not want to be disturbed.

45
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:33,031
That organ is finally disturbed
and then life is destroyed.

46
00:08:33,135 --> 00:08:44,271
 The person jumps from the window
and is finished. When you are touched

47
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:54,573
 on this level, you have a deep problem.

48
00:08:54,677 --> 00:09:08,979
We do not yet know all the different
parts and functions of the psyche.

49
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:19,979
 This is a gross enumeration of the parts
 which are concerned with our psychic.

50
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:24,750
Why do we say that this is important?

51
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:41,031
It is important because when we treat
 somebody and from apathy goes to some

52
00:09:41,135 --> 00:09:48,813
 melancholy and from melacholy goes down to anguish, then to phobias or to anxiety or to

53
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:55,708
irritability or disatisfatcion, then you
know he's going towards cure.

54
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:06,521
When the problems are going from
higher organs to lower organs,

55
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:14,781
we're going towards a cure. The person
 is doing well and many times you will need

56
00:10:14,885 --> 00:10:19,521
in your evaluation of a situation, where
you have given one remedy

57
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:25,719
you will need to think you will need to think
 what has happened because the man

58
00:10:25,823 --> 00:10:38,802
will tell you or the woman, men get
more depressed than women.

59
00:10:40,104 --> 00:10:53,052
Men get depressed in a ratio of 2:1.
They need Aurum, the suicidal remedy

60
00:10:53,156 --> 00:11:01,938
twice as much as women. So the man who
comes with suicidal depression and says,

61
00:11:02,042 --> 00:11:05,802
'I'm thinking of suicide'.
'How many times?'

62
00:11:05,906 --> 00:11:14,271
 20, 200 times the day,
 'I'm thinking of jumping from the window'.

63
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:28,583
If this man, you give Aurum, and changes
are coming and says, 'I now have fears,

64
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:44,625
I start fearing, I am a sinner, I have fears
that they are going to come and get me'.

65
00:11:47,177 --> 00:11:55,885
Then you know he is doing better and he's
gone to another remedy which is Lachesis.

66
00:11:56,708 --> 00:12:09,823
That is why the understanding of this hierarchy
 is very important for a Homeopath.

67
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:24,333
We go to the mental. We start with
absent mindedness.

68
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:34,469
Lower in the hierarchy, forgetfullness, lack
of concentration, lethargy, delusions,

69
00:12:34,573 --> 00:12:42,417
 paranoid ideas, destructive delirium,
complete mental confusion.

70
00:12:43,469 --> 00:12:50,094
So you see how the deterioration starts
and goes from one level to another,

71
00:12:50,198 --> 00:13:03,823
from one organ to another. This organ
here has different functions etc.

72
00:13:12,927 --> 00:13:20,521
-I just want to know for what reason you have
 put the lungs under the liver in the hierarchy.

73
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:39,115
-Because with one lung you can live, you
take out one lung, it's not so important.

74
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:52,646
If you take the liver out, you go to
the next plane. These are only indicative

75
00:13:52,750 --> 00:14:08,490
 and we do not claim to have the
absolute truth. If a disease goes

76
00:14:08,594 --> 00:14:17,625
 from the lungs to the liver, for instance,
 we have to know what we're doing.

77
00:14:17,729 --> 00:14:24,490
If the disease goes from the lungs
to the brain or to the heart we have to know

78
00:14:24,594 --> 00:14:32,667
that this is the wrong direction and
it is not good for our patient.

79
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:55,229
To know whether your treatment,
is doing well for this person.

80
00:14:55,333 --> 00:15:01,229
Is he doing well? Yes. That means
he has to follow this direction,

81
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:11,073
from apathy to sadness, to anguish or from complete mental confusion to lethargy, to dullness etc.

82
00:15:12,771 --> 00:15:22,604
In treating severe chronic cases, we don't
have the elimination suddenly of everything.

83
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:32,188
Most of the times you will have to encounter
 or to treat the disease or the disturbance

84
00:15:32,292 --> 00:15:40,333
that goes down to the hierarchy.
And then maybe you will need

85
00:15:40,438 --> 00:15:44,865
the second remedy or the third remedy.

86
00:15:49,021 --> 00:16:01,771
Here is a model with the 3 cones that the
3 levels are in a 3-dimensional picture.

87
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:18,563
It means that the body, the outside, envelopes, contains the other two. That's the first.

88
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:38,760
The second is that this model is divided
into levels. The third is, what is this?

89
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:51,896
 The emotional or the mental, the highest emotional part of our being and the

90
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:07,198
highest mental part of our being I depict
them outside of the physical body, the blue.

91
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:26,156
They do not correspond to any physical stucture. It's something beyond the physical structure.

92
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:50,917
It is the highest part in us, the highest spiritual part which is its purity .... how you would call it?

93
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:21,469
 Wisdom, pure wisdom.

94
00:18:21,531 --> 00:18:36,292
That our highest spiritual part is
pure wisdom. That means we know

95
00:18:36,396 --> 00:19:08,104
the truth if we can arrive at that state. And the highest emotional-psyche part is pure love.

96
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:18,667
Pure love and pure wisdom are
the highest parts which we can reach

97
00:19:18,771 --> 00:19:29,521
as human beings which do not
correspond to our physical body.

98
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:37,688
They do not have correspondence
with our physical part.

99
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:49,250
We can reach perhaps beyond
our physical existence.

100
00:19:50,823 --> 00:20:12,250
It means that most probably we can,
 in this life reach, concentrate our attention,

101
00:20:12,354 --> 00:20:29,875
awareness on that part and then become
as human beings the highest part in us.

102
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:48,271
Which maybe then it is indestructible.
 Maybe after death there is a process where

103
00:20:48,375 --> 00:21:02,333
this highest part of us, this understanding
and this love become a being which is carried

104
00:21:02,438 --> 00:21:17,802
outside of us, through that cosmic energy
 that is animating all of us at any time.

105
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:44,854
Well this is very practical. It's very practical
for us as human beings to know that the aim

106
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:57,948
 is love and wisdom. To concentrate all our
 efforts in that part of us which is the highest.

107
00:22:00,292 --> 00:22:10,458
What is the proof that such a process
 maybe true, maybe correct?

108
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:27,042
The proof is in several states in which we're going through, everyone of us in our life.

109
00:22:27,844 --> 00:22:34,188
An experience which everybody has
between the physical body

110
00:22:34,292 --> 00:22:49,135
and the detachment of that which
we call the vital body, a proof is what?

111
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:59,250
What everyday are doing in our sleep?
In our sleep we come out of our body

112
00:22:59,354 --> 00:23:09,313
into a world which is totally different,
 the dream world, we come out of our body

113
00:23:09,417 --> 00:23:18,188
carrying in us, many times, our
understanding and our emotions,

114
00:23:18,292 --> 00:23:22,958
 fear, phobias etc.  whatever they might be.

115
00:23:24,531 --> 00:23:41,146
Actually we're dying and resurrect every day.
 In our dreams we have the condition in which

116
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:50,604
our psyche, our emotions and our mind is.
 So if you have a nice dream, it means

117
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:56,604
that you had a nice psychogical condition.

118
00:23:56,708 --> 00:24:09,573
A bad dream means that brought you to the place where your fears, phobias etc. are.

119
00:24:11,823 --> 00:24:21,802
So for us there is very very clearly this part
 which we call emotional and mental

120
00:24:21,906 --> 00:24:35,646
it can be carried along with the vital body
which comes out and in the morning goes in.

121
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:50,063
Why do we go out? We go out and join
 the cosmic energy from which

122
00:24:50,167 --> 00:25:00,625
we get our batteries regenerated. We take
 the energy we need to carry the next day.

123
00:25:09,667 --> 00:25:22,917
We have several phases of dream.
 First phase we say I had a light sleep.

124
00:25:23,979 --> 00:25:32,396
That means the detachment was not great.

125
00:25:33,417 --> 00:25:39,271
So we are almost aware between
this world and the dream world.

126
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:53,031
And then we have a second phase
where the detachment is bigger

127
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:58,938
and a third phase where the detachment
 is really very very big.

128
00:25:59,042 --> 00:26:11,083
In which way you may even travel
 quite far from your body.

129
00:26:15,823 --> 00:26:27,115
And if by chance your organism is such,
that allows you to carry with you

130
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:39,417
 your awareness you may be seeing things
 which are happening on a different place.

131
00:26:40,396 --> 00:26:54,333
I remember once a girl studying in London.
 She came in a panic to see me in Athens

132
00:26:54,438 --> 00:27:02,781
 because she has been to the psychiatrists and they said that she should immediately take

133
00:27:02,885 --> 00:27:09,552
psychotropic drugs because of some
 phenomena that were happening to her.

134
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:16,490
She was really terrified. I said, 'what
are the phenomena?',

135
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:25,813
She said, 'I don't know, the moment
 I go to sleep in London, I fall asleep

136
00:27:25,917 --> 00:27:36,073
and immediately I find myself back
in Athens, in my house.

137
00:27:36,177 --> 00:27:44,135
And then I see my mother doing this,
my father, I hear what they say

138
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:52,229
but the most terrifying is that next day
 I telephone and I say, mammy did you

139
00:27:52,333 --> 00:28:04,021
talk to daddy yesterday? Did you do exactly
 this? And they confirm what I have seen.'

140
00:28:04,125 --> 00:28:11,813
 Since this is happening every day she
was terrified, she could not stop it

141
00:28:11,917 --> 00:28:19,073
and of course the psychiatrist told
 her that she is crazy.

142
00:28:19,177 --> 00:28:32,135
She had to take some
 drugs to sedate her.

143
00:28:44,292 --> 00:28:57,229
I said to her, 'I will tell you something.
I wish I had it. Your quality,

144
00:28:57,333 --> 00:29:04,802
your body is built in such way that
 the detachment from your vital body

145
00:29:04,906 --> 00:29:13,313
 is very easy for you, it can go very easily out.
Your desire to be with your parents

146
00:29:13,417 --> 00:29:18,094
 is very strong; so the desire to be
with your parents comes

147
00:29:18,198 --> 00:29:23,823
and then you have the possibility
 to travel back to Athens'.

148
00:29:25,865 --> 00:29:35,521
She looked at me. I said, 'this is a quality which only saintly people have in a such a degree.

149
00:29:37,104 --> 00:29:45,313
 Why do we say saintly? Those who
have reached close to the love

150
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:56,719
and wisdom state can have that
clearness in their psyche.

151
00:29:56,823 --> 00:30:07,354
Which they are not afraid to enter
 this world and travel through.

152
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:17,271
So you are lucky person, you don't have to
 be afraid of anything and I'm not going

153
00:30:17,417 --> 00:30:23,219
to give you a remedy because you
are not sick, you are quite well'.

154
00:30:24,021 --> 00:30:27,583
She wrote me 3 years later, she wrote
me a letter. I remember that letter,

155
00:30:27,688 --> 00:30:34,375
she said thank you very much for your advice.
 I finished my studies and I'm back to Greece.

156
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:42,875
Just because I had the correct information.

157
00:30:42,979 --> 00:30:58,854
She was not afraid anymore, this would
 not happen but only sporadically

158
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:04,385
because this was happening
out of her desire to be home.

159
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:11,073
The fear of what is going to happen,
the fear was exciting her psyche

160
00:31:11,177 --> 00:31:20,448
and the psyche was going out
and she was travelling.

161
00:31:20,552 --> 00:31:27,313
So you can imagine what happens if
I lecture in a medical university and tell

162
00:31:27,417 --> 00:31:35,896
all these things to the students where some professors are sitting down there,

163
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,135
listening and say, this is the
most dangerous man.

164
00:31:43,417 --> 00:31:53,229
Now there is some acceptance because of
the fear of death, the phenomenon of death

165
00:31:53,333 --> 00:32:00,781
is coming, is overwhelming for
everyone, so they have to think twice

166
00:32:00,802 --> 00:32:06,104
before they decide who is
dangerous and who is not.

167
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:30,833
Another state in which we have this
 detachment is somnambulism. Sleep walking.

168
00:32:32,177 --> 00:32:39,333
There we have the phenomenon
 not of full detachment

169
00:32:39,438 --> 00:32:52,708
but half detachment where the body can be moving but not completely, not totally free.

170
00:33:02,104 --> 00:33:20,594
Next state is fainting. Fainting means that
 vital body is suddenly ejected out.

171
00:33:26,823 --> 00:33:41,000
Do you have a remedy in the Materia Medica where the body is going quite far

172
00:33:41,104 --> 00:33:47,865
and then falling back suddenly?

173
00:33:48,802 --> 00:33:55,313
We have mainly 2 remedies if this
 phenomenon happens.

174
00:33:55,417 --> 00:34:01,646
Te person comes back with a jump.
In the dream they feel they fall

175
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:08,708
from a high place, down and
they wake up like this.

176
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:15,583
We have 2 remedies; one is Belladonna
and the other is Thuja. Thuj. and Bell.

177
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:23,385
are the main remedies for people having
this phenomenon where

178
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:29,729
 they feel they come down on a jump.

179
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:49,312
So fainting is also such a detachment
and then of course it is anaesthesia.

180
00:34:56,552 --> 00:35:08,000
What happens with anaesthesia?
What they do, they eject out the vital body

181
00:35:08,104 --> 00:35:15,427
and if you go to the medical schools
and talk about this disassociation,

182
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:24,573
they will tell you you're talking
occultism or nonsense.

183
00:35:26,396 --> 00:35:31,854
But they are doing it every time and many
 many times it is well known that people

184
00:35:31,958 --> 00:35:40,896
who are under this state, they are able to observe and to hear and to see,

185
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,542
they have described it later on as
out of the body experiences.

186
00:35:46,646 --> 00:36:02,260
Kubler-Ross, who knows Kubler-Ross?
Very good. I see you are informed.

187
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:13,854
She has described a lot of cases in which
 people come back from this realm,

188
00:36:13,958 --> 00:36:30,625
the beyond and they describe the experiences they had while they were near or half-dead.

189
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:53,823
Another state in which we have
 this association, tell me.

190
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:21,813
Epileptic fit, short of.
Meditation.Yogi state.

191
00:37:24,333 --> 00:37:33,094
Yogi state. It is described in many many
 books where the yogis or these people

192
00:37:33,198 --> 00:37:43,760
who are in deep meditation, they stay
motionless as if the body was totally dead,

193
00:37:43,865 --> 00:37:51,896
while they are outside of their body travelling
 and having experiences etc. etc.

194
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:59,333
This is very well described in many religions
by many people, by many authors.

195
00:38:00,865 --> 00:38:11,604
See how many proofs we have of this phenomenon and still we are not able to

196
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:23,260
incorporate this information into the Medicine
 and into the treatment of the human being.

197
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:33,594
And treating the human being only as physical body. Let's see some other states.

198
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:51,979
Another state in which the disassociation takes place is when somebody lives between

199
00:38:52,083 --> 00:38:58,573
this world and the other. Schizophrenia.

200
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:12,271
In schizophrenia people live half outside
of their body, a little bit outside and having

201
00:39:12,375 --> 00:39:23,979
the experiences of the next world, of the
world beyond and at the same time having

202
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:34,469
the body moved or doing whatever they are doing but not completely back into their body.

203
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:40,271
That's why in schizophrenia, they have
found out from old times they say,

204
00:39:40,375 --> 00:39:48,188
let's inject some energy in there, some
shock, electroshock, they used to call it.

205
00:39:48,292 --> 00:39:55,740
Still I think they use it from time to time.
They put energy through the body

206
00:39:55,844 --> 00:40:04,771
and the shock brings back actually and fits together the vital body with the physical body.

207
00:40:04,875 --> 00:40:13,219
And the person comes back in this world.
 It's not anymore half of that other world.

208
00:40:15,792 --> 00:40:22,417
Another proof of this phenomenon.

209
00:40:28,156 --> 00:40:40,563
 And of course the hallucinogenic drugs
 that the young generation has used,

210
00:40:40,667 --> 00:40:56,229
I would say, unwisely. The young generation wanted the experience of the next world

211
00:40:56,333 --> 00:41:04,542
 which they call it, the spiritual world.
I want to know what happens beyond.

212
00:41:04,646 --> 00:41:14,521
I like to have the experience. They took hallucinogenic drugs which disassociate

213
00:41:14,625 --> 00:41:20,760
 the physical body with the vital body,
 they bring them out and they have

214
00:41:20,865 --> 00:41:28,938
experiences of different kinds.
Some of them, nice experiences,

215
00:41:29,042 --> 00:41:34,021
some of them very bad and very
scaring experiences.

216
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:42,667
Can anybody tell me why some have nice experiences and some have bad experiences?

217
00:41:52,823 --> 00:42:00,125
-I would say it's the mirror within them.
They project what they have inside.

218
00:42:01,667 --> 00:42:12,250
-Somebody else what would say?
Is anybody else want to talk on this matter?

219
00:42:12,354 --> 00:42:19,490
I know about 35% of you, you have
 used these drugs.

220
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:44,958
Now that I look better it's more.
Maybe 50%. Once I was in America.

221
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:51,292
I was in a class like this, about that size.
I said, who has used drugs?

222
00:42:51,396 --> 00:43:00,135
Everyone raised his hand.
Who has not? No hand.

223
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:14,823
For me I was, how can I say, I was
the forerunner of the hippies.

224
00:43:16,375 --> 00:43:34,604
Because I left Greece to go to India back
 in 58, still hippies were not existent.

225
00:43:34,708 --> 00:43:51,917
And I went to India and searched for spirituality and all this kind but I never used any drugs.

226
00:43:52,021 --> 00:43:57,865
It was not necessary.

227
00:43:58,906 --> 00:44:06,833
It is not necessary to use drugs
because, can anybody tell me why?

228
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:16,354
If you understand the reason why some people have good experiences and others

229
00:44:16,458 --> 00:44:23,156
 have bad experiences, you will
understand why you should not use

230
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:28,167
hallucinogenic drugs
for such experiences.

231
00:44:38,958 --> 00:44:52,135
The question is...I believe Stanislav Groff,
a man whom I met while I was in Essalen.

232
00:44:52,240 --> 00:45:03,531
He was living next to Essalen. He was using these drugs for curing, mentally ill people.

233
00:45:04,333 --> 00:45:14,979
Something which can cause, can cure of
 course. It is the idea of similars in a crude way.

234
00:45:15,083 --> 00:45:25,646
But my question to you, I know you have taken drugs and all that and you must not feel that

235
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:31,646
 I'm accusing anybody, neither because
you experimented with anything.

236
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:45,646
For me there is no judgement at all. I'm giving you my understanding concerning drugs

237
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:51,490
because it is a problem that you are
going to face with your patients.

238
00:45:52,292 --> 00:45:59,979
You have to know, to have clear ideas, what is happening to them, why this and why that.

239
00:46:00,083 --> 00:46:05,625
We have to be as clear as possible.
Of course we cannot talk indefinitely.

240
00:46:05,729 --> 00:46:17,604
But I want to give you my opinion concerning
 the urge for spiritual understanding of this era,

241
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:34,000
 of this time in the planet. Where the spiritual awareness has become a major target

242
00:46:34,104 --> 00:46:45,604
 for the young generation.
To tell you what I know about the drugs

243
00:46:45,708 --> 00:46:52,031
 and what cause and why. I have seen
 a lot of cases that are going crazy

244
00:46:52,135 --> 00:47:02,406
 under the use of cannabis indica.
Where I hear a lot of people saying,

245
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:17,073
this is totally innocent. I'm not interfering
with this legal idea. What I know

246
00:47:17,177 --> 00:47:24,563
 is that I've seen cases under cannabis indica that have gone almost crazy, in panic states,

247
00:47:24,667 --> 00:47:32,917
tremendous panic state which never
 left them, 10 years, 15, 20 years.

248
00:47:33,708 --> 00:47:44,667
And the suffering has been tremendous after that. The cocaine also, absolutely. Much worse.

249
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:55,333
Cannabis indica is hashish, you call
it grass, hashish whatever.

250
00:48:04,573 --> 00:48:12,240
-I think it has something to do with
the susceptibility of the patient.

251
00:48:15,708 --> 00:48:20,083
-I'll explain to you the mechanics.

252
00:48:26,802 --> 00:48:34,125
We're talking on something
which is really beyond.

253
00:48:36,625 --> 00:48:48,531
Here are the three worlds,
the physical, the psychic and the spiritual.

254
00:48:54,333 --> 00:49:03,448
This is gross, but you will understand the idea. We are here on the physical world.

255
00:49:03,552 --> 00:49:16,292
And we are in a hierarchy.
According to our spiritual evolution

256
00:49:16,396 --> 00:49:23,219
we belong to different kinds of levels.

257
00:49:26,875 --> 00:49:38,760
Now a person who is in this level, because
 he is doing some correct things in his life,

258
00:49:38,865 --> 00:49:49,781
 he is really trying to clean himself,
to become a better human being

259
00:49:49,885 --> 00:49:59,771
because of that, he may find himself going up
 to the hierarchy, from one day to the other.

260
00:50:00,823 --> 00:50:09,188
You take a decision. I will never do
 again, whatever. You are raised.

261
00:50:10,573 --> 00:50:17,271
So people who are taking drugs belong
to different levels according

262
00:50:17,375 --> 00:50:28,823
to their psychical condition. What are
the fears inside, the guilt?

263
00:50:29,625 --> 00:50:42,604
On the other hand are the aspirations.
You are going to eject yourself from this

264
00:50:42,708 --> 00:50:58,760
physical world to this world, the
psychic world. This psychic world is also

265
00:50:58,865 --> 00:51:21,979
  hierarchically established. So you go out from the physical world and you enter this world.

266
00:51:24,542 --> 00:51:38,698
According to the law of similarity, homogeneity, homogenous things will be together.

267
00:51:38,802 --> 00:51:55,365
The psychic world is a dream wolrd
where we do not have our will active.

268
00:51:55,469 --> 00:52:08,823
So what is active? Another law beyond our
 will. This law says, if you eject yourself out of

269
00:52:08,927 --> 00:52:18,583
your body, you'll go where you belong.
Not where you'd like to be.

270
00:52:21,333 --> 00:52:32,604
How this is determined? It is determined according to the clearness of your soul.

271
00:52:32,708 --> 00:52:51,958
 How clear your soul is. So this lower part of
 the psychic is a part full of gross nightmares.

272
00:52:53,000 --> 00:53:02,469
This world where you enter, you fight. It is
the lowest part of the psychic world.

273
00:53:02,573 --> 00:53:13,563
As this psychic world becomes clearer and clearer approaching the spiritual world,

274
00:53:13,667 --> 00:53:18,719
it becomes very clear. So here is very clear.
 The experiences on this level are fantastic.

275
00:53:27,083 --> 00:53:33,760
 If you enter there you feel sometimes,
you see a dream, you have an experience,

276
00:53:33,865 --> 00:53:40,271
the skies are opening and it is a fantastic experience. You say, my God.

277
00:53:40,375 --> 00:53:53,417
You deserve that because it happened to you. Now you take the drug and you eject.

278
00:53:54,708 --> 00:54:08,750
You will find yourself in one of these levels feeling and having the experience of that level.

279
00:54:09,844 --> 00:54:21,250
So if you go and take drugs by the time you
 are depressed or you are full of hatetred,

280
00:54:22,042 --> 00:54:30,094
 if you go and take during this time, then your soul is disturbed, it's going to eject in the

281
00:54:30,198 --> 00:54:38,625
lowest part and your experiences are
going to be really bad.

282
00:54:39,708 --> 00:54:51,292
People have been relating to me their experiences and they were really frightening.

283
00:54:52,844 --> 00:55:03,854
You see, this part of the world is the
protection for the spiritual world because

284
00:55:03,958 --> 00:55:16,115
you cannot enter the spiritual world where there is pure love and wisdom; it has to be protected.

285
00:55:16,219 --> 00:55:22,094
Otherwise everybody would take a drug,
shoot up to the spiritual part

286
00:55:22,198 --> 00:55:35,219
and here I am with the angels or
whatever,  I came ejecting.

287
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:46,052
So there is a mechanism for protection.
The more you want to eject,

288
00:55:46,156 --> 00:55:53,063
that means the more drugs you take,
the more you are punished and

289
00:55:53,167 --> 00:56:05,927
you eject but you stay here.
 Some young people who have a nice soul,

290
00:56:08,729 --> 00:56:24,365
 they are pure, they eject and they go quite high there; so their experiences are really beautiful.

291
00:56:24,469 --> 00:56:31,104
But if they keep on doing that,
then what happens.

292
00:56:31,208 --> 00:56:38,427
A young person does not know what it's happening. So he has this experience

293
00:56:38,531 --> 00:56:50,667
and then what? He says, I'm now free.
Before I was afraid to have sex.

294
00:56:50,771 --> 00:57:01,073
Now I took this drug, I felt more free,
I can have sex. They take drugs a few times;

295
00:57:01,177 --> 00:57:11,042
then they go and start having sex.
That means violating again another law.

296
00:57:12,375 --> 00:57:22,260
Then the opposite starts working and the purity becomes impure, more impure, more impure.

297
00:57:23,042 --> 00:57:29,365
Then they end up, if they shoot up to come
 back to the lower part. That's why some

298
00:57:29,469 --> 00:57:38,052
of them have some initial experiences that
 were very nice, very good, very uplifting

299
00:57:38,156 --> 00:57:43,885
and later on they enter this world and
they had frightening experiences.

300
00:57:57,531 --> 00:58:07,313
Of course it is not like this but just
 to give you the idea.

301
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:15,333
These 3 worlds are interfering
 with one another.

302
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:30,854
What I'm interested in is to give you the mechanics of how the human body

303
00:58:30,958 --> 00:58:45,000
is working and whether you can help, so an individual takes the right way towards help.

304
00:58:45,708 --> 00:58:55,667
Which is attaining the highest possible love
 and the highest possible wisdom.

305
00:59:02,198 --> 00:59:07,667
How? By the homeopathic remedy?
What the homeopathic remedy is doing?

306
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:14,771
She said, I had some autogenic
 training and during

307
00:59:14,875 --> 00:59:20,448
that training I left my body and I had
some experiences which were good

308
00:59:20,552 --> 00:59:29,021
and sometimes were bad, so where
am I in this level, good or bad?

309
00:59:30,292 --> 00:59:40,604
The good or bad experiences depend
on the time that you were doing this.

310
00:59:40,708 --> 00:59:52,271
If at the time when you're doing this,
your soul is free of anguish, anxiety,

311
00:59:52,375 --> 01:00:01,719
depression whatever, then you are
allowed to go on a higher place.

312
01:00:01,823 --> 01:00:09,052
If on the other hand it is disturbed.
You left the house or you thought something

313
01:00:09,156 --> 01:00:21,271
 and then the sub-conscious is disturbed, what you are going to experience is your inner self.

314
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:30,250
This is not different. It is not that you are experiencing something outside yourself.

315
01:00:30,354 --> 01:00:36,771
You are experiencing something
on which there is homogeneity.

316
01:00:38,594 --> 01:00:55,958
You enter a field where things are;
your inner state of soul at the moment.

317
01:01:04,104 --> 01:01:15,531
I don't know if you have ever confessed.
 Let me give you the experience.

318
01:01:16,542 --> 01:01:39,917
You go to the priest or whoever and you really confess. That means you are really shaken

319
01:01:40,021 --> 01:01:44,490
by an experience and you go and confess.

320
01:01:44,594 --> 01:02:02,979
And you say to the priest and I'm very sorry.
 You went there out of instict to confess.

321
01:02:04,667 --> 01:02:12,365
You enter with a tremendous loading,
in one minute, you go out and you fly.

322
01:02:12,469 --> 01:02:22,354
You feel so well, so good, the air
is clean, the sky is open.

323
01:02:22,865 --> 01:02:31,188
If that time you eject up, you will go quite
 high. Then what happens with us is that

324
01:02:31,292 --> 01:02:43,094
we again fall with our weaknesses and
we load our sub-conscious mind again

325
01:02:43,198 --> 01:02:54,646
with guilt, fears, phobias etc. etc.
And then you go out again and again

326
01:02:54,750 --> 01:03:00,854
there is a bad experience. But from one
 moment to the other, your sub-conscious

327
01:03:00,958 --> 01:03:11,333
can empty; the idea of confession is one
on which we shall be talking a lot

328
01:03:11,438 --> 01:03:15,083
concerning the homeopathic remedy.
