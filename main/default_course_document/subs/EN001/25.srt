1
00:00:20,042 --> 00:00:29,677
I want you to be clear as to how
diseases are manifesting.

2
00:00:38,792 --> 00:00:45,396
We have been talking about predisposition
 for a disease to manifest.

3
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:57,375
You need a predisposition, which is
 lying dormant in a potential form.

4
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:02,656
Potentially you have the possibility
for going into depression.

5
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,437
Potentially you have the possibility
 for going into insomnia.

6
00:01:08,542 --> 00:01:14,969
Potentially you have the possibility that your heart will get involved. Potentially...

7
00:01:16,552 --> 00:01:37,896
So this is not enough. We need that some stressor will activate this predisposition.

8
00:01:40,792 --> 00:01:49,552
So we said, disposition comes from
hereditary and predisposition is formed

9
00:01:49,656 --> 00:01:53,708
also because of the way that we live.
We create predisposition.

10
00:01:53,813 --> 00:02:04,042
We create predisposition also
with the drugs that we take.

11
00:02:04,146 --> 00:02:09,729
The more chemicals we put into
the organism, the more we change

12
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:17,323
the predisposition.
 And this I think is clear.

13
00:02:17,427 --> 00:02:29,125
So how the predisposition is created?
Hereditary, way of life and drugs.

14
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:44,740
The predisposition now is activated.
By what stressor can it be activated?

15
00:02:47,365 --> 00:02:56,302
Shock, stress, what else?

16
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:12,688
You have a predisposition for meningoencephalitis. You will not get it

17
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:22,000
unless you come in an area where there is
 the virus where we have the epidemics.

18
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:42,677
So we have the nosological
agents. Bacteria, virus etc.

19
00:03:47,635 --> 00:03:58,729
We know especially how acute
diseases are produced;

20
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:05,042
through coming in contact
with the virus, the bacteria.

21
00:04:07,677 --> 00:04:22,240
What is not understood very well, isthe
stress. And the stress is of several types.

22
00:04:22,344 --> 00:04:39,896
One type of stress comes from psychological, mental, physical, ok, but the source of stress?

23
00:04:40,052 --> 00:04:43,833
As human beings we have to understand ourselves, living on the planet,

24
00:04:43,938 --> 00:04:48,896
 living in a society what
can stress us?

25
00:04:53,323 --> 00:05:08,813
-Unnatural way of life, the way of life
which is not at a certain rhythm,

26
00:05:08,917 --> 00:05:12,250
 living in a city, living too fast.

27
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:21,240
-Yes, but the unnatural life why it comes?
You live an unnatural life for instance

28
00:05:21,344 --> 00:05:28,708
because you work too much. You work
from day to night, very late at night

29
00:05:28,813 --> 00:05:39,354
and you get sick. Of course you can have unnatural life by having pleasure

30
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:45,969
from morning till night, all the time
 pleasure, you also get sick.

31
00:05:53,615 --> 00:05:59,688
With the drugs ok, we know
that is going to cause some problems.

32
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:07,990
But what other stresses?
Where do they come from?

33
00:06:11,094 --> 00:06:17,656
-I think is because we all are in
 a state of fear; fear of losing,

34
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:34,833
fear of thinking what we are, why we live
this way, why we chose the other way......

35
00:06:36,917 --> 00:06:51,896
-We fear we may lose the house, we may
 lose what you believe is your support

36
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:00,229
in order to exist, in order to keep on living.

37
00:07:02,365 --> 00:07:11,198
So stresses can come from
the instinct of survival.

38
00:07:11,302 --> 00:07:20,094
The underlying thing is,
I want to survive, is the idea of life.

39
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:28,771
The idea of life is to bring us back to life.
We die, back to life, we die, back to life.

40
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:36,146
Cells are dying, new cells are created.
So these circles happen

41
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:42,521
in psychological state as well.

42
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:55,792
We lose a job, how can I live now without
a job? This is a big stress and this can be

43
00:07:55,896 --> 00:08:00,479
exciting cause for the predisposition.

44
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:07,146
This predisposition, Hahnemann calls it,
the maintaining cause.

45
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:19,833
And this is called,
the exciting cause.

46
00:08:21,917 --> 00:08:33,292
So it comes from survival instinct.

47
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:56,146
Most people when they
come to you to be treated,

48
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:03,396
you will find that either they have gone
through such a stress for survival

49
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,771
 or they have gone to another stress.

50
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:09,688
-Frustration.

51
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:13,833
-On what level?

52
00:09:14,365 --> 00:09:16,167
-Emotional level.

53
00:09:16,271 --> 00:09:39,354
-Frustration on emotional and sexual level.
 Here this instinct also has the idea

54
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:52,635
of survival on second level. Here you
have survival on first level.

55
00:09:52,740 --> 00:10:03,552
I have to survive. Everything that threatens
my survival as a human being with body

56
00:10:03,656 --> 00:10:19,281
and needs, everything that comes against
that can trigger disease, that's the first level.

57
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:29,615
Then there is another level which we
call emotional stress and conflict

58
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:35,427
on the emotional and sexual level.

59
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:51,187
And this I call it the survival of a second
 level, the instinct to procreate,

60
00:10:51,292 --> 00:10:57,208
 the instinct to live through my children.

61
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:10,219
That is the basic, very fundamental instinct
which if challenged then we are very shaken.

62
00:11:10,323 --> 00:11:27,615
So it's very interesting that this stress here is
not actually as powerful as this stress here.

63
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:37,240
This stress is much more powerful and much more frequent we see it as an exciting cause

64
00:11:37,344 --> 00:11:42,969
 for disease. And this contains the emotional
 and the sexual stress which is

65
00:11:43,073 --> 00:11:55,479
I lost my wife, I lost my child, I lost
whatever I loved and whatever

66
00:11:55,583 --> 00:12:05,875
was made to make me live, to
continue living in the future.

67
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:15,417
It is a survival instinct which humans
 beings are having very strongly

68
00:12:15,521 --> 00:12:22,313
but you can see absolutely the difference between this and that levels;

69
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:29,906
 here is mostly mental, here it is
mostly emotional.

70
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:39,708
Now the third source of disease for
our times, in our societies,

71
00:12:39,813 --> 00:13:02,458
that means the western societies, another
 source is the spiritual survival.

72
00:13:08,427 --> 00:13:16,552
This level of stress becomes more
and more powerful and when

73
00:13:16,656 --> 00:13:26,552
it comes to the point where it can affect
the body, it can really destroy you,

74
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:40,729
 who am I ? What am I doing? It is so powerful this realization, 'I have wasted my life,

75
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:49,917
 I have done nothing, I have just lived for pleasure, for nothing more than pleasure.

76
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:18,198
That can lead some people to commit suicide,
 it destroys the life immediately,

77
00:14:18,302 --> 00:14:22,885
this conflict on spiritual level.

78
00:14:26,385 --> 00:14:36,708
Our societies have gone through the periods
 of survival instinct on physical level,

79
00:14:36,813 --> 00:14:42,396
that means we have enough means
to support ourselves physically,

80
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:51,458
especially the more north we go, the more
 the survival instinct plays no part.

81
00:14:51,563 --> 00:15:00,969
You feel secure, government will take
care of me. In Sweden I have heard

82
00:15:01,073 --> 00:15:10,167
 that it's better not to work because the gover-nment pays you more money not to work.

83
00:15:12,031 --> 00:15:21,688
How many people will get sick from that
 instinct? very few. But as you know,

84
00:15:26,365 --> 00:15:39,198
 Sweden recently, 10-15 years ago was
the number 1 country for suicide,

85
00:15:39,302 --> 00:15:50,792
 even for children. Children did not
 find a meaning in life.

86
00:15:52,385 --> 00:16:01,729
It is very interesting to look historically
upon these things and to look in a rather

87
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:14,427
comprehensive way to understand disease
 how disease is affecting our planet.

88
00:16:16,479 --> 00:16:21,302
So survival instinct for our society
 is not powerful anymore.

89
00:16:21,406 --> 00:16:34,573
That means that the predisposition is not anymore sensitive to information

90
00:16:34,677 --> 00:16:37,875
that comes from that level.

91
00:16:41,271 --> 00:16:43,865
What about this level here?

92
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:57,323
You see as the societies go more towards a sense of security, here, they also need security.

93
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:01,990
What was the security here?

94
00:17:02,094 --> 00:17:11,354
You will see how diseases were
produced. Can we have security?

95
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:18,646
Because on the emotional level you will
always depend upon the other person,

96
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,219
whoever it might be.

97
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:36,948
The government cannot say here, I will
give you a wife forever, it's not possible.

98
00:17:37,052 --> 00:17:54,104
So the insecurity of this level led
 to a way of life to find security.

99
00:17:54,208 --> 00:18:03,427
They realized that I cannot depend on one person. Therefore let me depend on 5.

100
00:18:04,229 --> 00:18:14,500
So instead of 1 wife, let me have 2 or 5.
That is how the sexual liberation took place.

101
00:18:14,604 --> 00:18:20,552
 You know the sexual liberation
movement that took place in

102
00:18:20,656 --> 00:18:26,656
 the western world after the
second world war.

103
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:43,188
Seeking more security on that level brought about a culture which actually produces

104
00:18:43,292 --> 00:18:50,250
 disease even worse than before.

105
00:18:50,354 --> 00:18:57,604
Because here the values were twisted.

106
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:09,385
Here you need a child, a family, now you
have your security, your support.

107
00:19:11,365 --> 00:19:19,615
The society in America, let's say,
the child is 17 and says, bye,bye,

108
00:19:19,719 --> 00:19:25,948
I can do whatever I like now,
no family I don't need you.

109
00:19:26,052 --> 00:19:33,771
I was in America and a woman who had
 5 children, 2 had left the house,

110
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:40,521
one was 16 and the other was 12.
She said, the 12 is ok to be here

111
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:48,354
 but the 16 I'm worried. I said, why?
Because she has not left the house.

112
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:53,281
I said, in the age of 16 you expect that?
She said, of course to leave the house.

113
00:19:58,188 --> 00:20:04,885
So the life, the support which existed
 before, is broken down.

114
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:08,771
Now you try to find another security.
 The child goes out by itself

115
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:18,250
and looks for security, to find a partner,
 to find somebody who understands me.

116
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:34,771
It's a mad search for a partner
who is compatible and there

117
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:40,677
all the dramas are taking
place in this area.

118
00:20:45,365 --> 00:20:53,198
The worst is what she related,
 it's disgusting.

119
00:20:53,302 --> 00:21:03,688
You see the perversion on this level
because with a child there is abuse.

120
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:06,438
He abuses a child to find what?

121
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:16,479
To find some pleasure? How much
insecurity this man must have.

122
00:21:16,698 --> 00:21:29,813
He did not have any kind of affection
and then finds, this is extreme of course

123
00:21:29,917 --> 00:21:35,042
but all the time dramas are taking place.

124
00:21:40,073 --> 00:21:46,833
And stimulation on the predisposition
comes from that level.

125
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:55,531
So in analyzing in this way I will tell you,
 maybe you don't see what it has to do with,

126
00:21:55,635 --> 00:22:00,458
 but analyzing and understanding
really the problem in depth,

127
00:22:00,563 --> 00:22:07,323
we may be able to take eventually
some correct measures.

128
00:22:08,052 --> 00:22:15,146
So you are prepared to be the healers.
A healer, what is the healer?

129
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:24,646
It's not that you have a pain and I give
you an aspirin, no. The healer is somebody

130
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:31,938
 who cares about a situation which is
diseased and has to bring it back to health.

131
00:22:32,042 --> 00:22:42,104
 Now the despair comes because you look
upon what we have created in our societies

132
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:59,813
 and we missed the way to health, it's not possible. Because here we completely lost,

133
00:22:59,917 --> 00:23:08,146
 with the conflicts inside that we have,
we lost completely the way.

134
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:17,260
We are totally lost, I can tell you.
No education on that level, at all.

135
00:23:17,365 --> 00:23:26,948
In school, did you ever heard a teacher
teaching you not how not to make love,

136
00:23:27,052 --> 00:23:33,969
 because now in school they say, oh we must teach sex behaviour, the school is crazy.

137
00:23:34,073 --> 00:23:42,125
It's not to teach a child how to make love,
a child of 12 to tell him, oh you lie down,

138
00:23:42,229 --> 00:23:53,552
you lift your legs. I mean this is terrible,
they look and say I don't want that.

139
00:23:54,250 --> 00:24:03,104
And the government says, oh we
put sexual behavior in our classes,

140
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:07,531
this is craziness which has
come because of that.

141
00:24:07,635 --> 00:24:17,948
They don't teach the class that love is
very important, to give is very important,

142
00:24:18,052 --> 00:24:28,615
music is very important, to feed this
 emotional level. What kind of food?

143
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:37,813
Here, you take the mind and the
children and teach history, language,

144
00:24:37,917 --> 00:24:42,375
I have to learn, I have to learn.
The child gets crowded with information.

145
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:58,094
We educate the mental level and then also
 the body, athletics, ok mind and body.

146
00:24:58,875 --> 00:25:06,833
And in between which are the emotions
it's a mess. We don't know what is right,

147
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:11,104
 what is wrong, is it good to have sex,
 is it not good?

148
00:25:11,208 --> 00:25:13,531
Some say it's good for the girl to know
 by the age of 12 what is sex.

149
00:25:20,073 --> 00:25:26,396
That is pure nonsense,
it's criminal in my understanding.

150
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,531
Because somebody might have
 a different opinion.

151
00:25:29,635 --> 00:25:36,042
I understand we might have different
 opinions but for me that is why

152
00:25:36,146 --> 00:25:40,729
we are led to be  so
much diseased at this level.

153
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:50,948
Then when I see the case, what do I see? Conflicts in that level so deep and so dramatic,

154
00:25:51,052 --> 00:25:57,583
that has teared off the health completely.

155
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:10,104
What actually is happening in our society?

156
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:20,604
This was solved by the governments,
by the civilization. This could not be solved

157
00:26:20,708 --> 00:26:30,531
and brought about a lot of suffering and then
 that suffering brought us to the next step

158
00:26:30,635 --> 00:26:42,646
which was the spiritual inquiry. What
was there? Survival, the total survival.

159
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:46,302
 People say, I cannot survive here
because my body is going to die.

160
00:26:46,406 --> 00:26:50,792
I cannot survive here because I do not
 have children, even if I have children,

161
00:26:50,896 --> 00:27:03,021
they just left me. So how can I survive?
Only if I become one with God who is eternal.

162
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:13,813
 We arrived at the spiritual level and
 inquiry in our times prematurely,

163
00:27:13,917 --> 00:27:19,917
through suffering on that
level wanting survival.

164
00:27:20,365 --> 00:27:24,750
Because I cannot survive if
I don't pray I cannot survive.

165
00:27:24,854 --> 00:27:32,240
That's why I said praying is Verat. or Aur.,
you give Aur. and they stop praying.

166
00:27:32,344 --> 00:27:42,656
But they start praying and say, 'God help me'
whatever way you say, different ways.

167
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:51,594
It's the idea that I must survive and this
time the survival must be eternal.

168
00:27:51,698 --> 00:28:03,646
And all these spiritual gurus are basing
their teaching in this fear of the individuals

169
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:13,406
that are going to be destroyed and
then there is eternal hell or eternal nothing.

170
00:28:14,417 --> 00:28:22,688
There is a fear and then they play on this
fear and say, ok we give you the solution.

171
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:34,708
You sit down, you breathe properly and then
 this gives you a sense of well being of course.

172
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:45,375
The problem is, are you ready, are you
healthy enough to reach that level naturally?

173
00:28:45,479 --> 00:28:52,500
Or you reach that level in an unhealthy
state coming from conflict?

174
00:28:52,896 --> 00:29:02,198
And then the hippy movement is exactly
that, the conflict on that level.

175
00:29:02,302 --> 00:29:10,344
They said, make love not war
and they meant make sex.

176
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:24,167
And then pretending, take a flower
 and give it to the soldier.

177
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:36,635
This is internal thing, it has nothing to do
 with giving flower, it is an inner state

178
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:42,656
of peace and love which flows out.
If you don't have that, forget it.

179
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:51,906
How can you have that if you are on
the conflict all the time,

180
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:54,844
I want this man, I want this woman.
She doesn't want me

181
00:29:55,698 --> 00:30:00,688
and then suffering,
what shall I do? I will kill her.

182
00:30:00,792 --> 00:30:06,688
You know sometimes you reach that state
and then you've almost killed her and say

183
00:30:06,792 --> 00:30:10,354
'God what have I done? Please help me'.

184
00:30:10,458 --> 00:30:25,479
And then you enter in that level in which
the twist is so much that when you meet

185
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:38,000
even young people with that history,
is going to be very very difficult to treat

186
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:45,260
 because of the confusion that has
been created and the outlet

187
00:30:45,365 --> 00:30:52,219
which has been found which
now it has to be totally restructured.

188
00:30:52,323 --> 00:31:02,052
How can you restructure somebody who
has been disappointed from love so much?

189
00:31:03,073 --> 00:31:08,385
That everything has fallen into pieces?

190
00:31:09,969 --> 00:31:15,146
And then you give something, she comes
 out but the possibility of getting back

191
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:21,948
is very much, unless you make them
 realize slowly by example,

192
00:31:22,052 --> 00:31:28,438
 by talking, by whatever way,
what is the right thing to do.

193
00:31:28,542 --> 00:31:35,656
And the right thing to do here,
in order to survive what is it?

194
00:31:50,917 --> 00:31:59,615
I talk very logically, I don't make
 jumps in logic, neither I'm spiritual

195
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:06,281
neither I'm against spirituality;
don't get me wrong.

196
00:32:06,385 --> 00:32:18,896
We have to reach that state
but not as a cause of a disease.

197
00:32:20,969 --> 00:32:29,729
I would like to reach here, in the
spiritual level to which we have the

198
00:32:29,833 --> 00:32:42,833
right to be, in a healthy way. Therefore the enquiry, who am I, what am I doing?

199
00:32:44,406 --> 00:32:49,719
People are so aggressive, like
sharks, they want to eat me

200
00:32:51,917 --> 00:32:55,969
and then outlet: I will find God.
This is the wrong way.

201
00:33:05,458 --> 00:33:14,531
 Maybe some people will survive
 really but how many? Very, very few.

202
00:33:14,635 --> 00:33:21,021
Who are these? Those who have a
good health will survive spiritually.

203
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:32,833
That means the spiritual people, the saints,
the yogis, those who have enlightenment.

204
00:33:32,938 --> 00:33:40,656
If you examine them in the totality
their health is very good.

205
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:49,865
 So of primary importance, for the
spiritual evolution of the human race

206
00:33:49,969 --> 00:33:53,865
is a presupposition that we
have to have good health.

207
00:33:53,969 --> 00:34:06,604
Otherwise we cannot enter these
realms of extreme ecstasy or

208
00:34:06,708 --> 00:34:17,479
whatever is called that high state of spirituality.
The body will not tolerate so much energy.

209
00:34:17,583 --> 00:34:26,062
 It's like allowing yourself all the
energy to go through your body.

210
00:34:26,167 --> 00:34:34,937
You have to have a very powerful body.
This is how I see spirituality.

211
00:34:39,125 --> 00:34:49,104
Sometimes we have to
understand which comes first.

212
00:34:49,208 --> 00:35:01,083
You cannot do all damage
here and then seek here.

213
00:35:01,188 --> 00:35:07,021
You remember what I said,
Homeopathy is confession.

214
00:35:07,125 --> 00:35:12,552
You give a remedy and
then the body confesses.

215
00:35:12,656 --> 00:35:18,750
Brings out the eruption, all the problem
 was coming out in her skin

216
00:35:18,854 --> 00:35:31,969
and you say, great. She felt relieved
inside. Wait and it will go away.

217
00:35:41,271 --> 00:35:51,573
-In the level of emotions, you have
several levels and some people can go

218
00:35:51,677 --> 00:36:06,729
through the levels into the spiritual by getting through some levels and then pass.

219
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:19,958
 But if you have something in the emotional
 part, you can't  get clearly through.

220
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:31,583
-Yes. You have these 3 levels, here is
 the emotional which is damaged.

221
00:36:31,688 --> 00:36:36,479
Here is the mental. The highest
part of the mental here

222
00:36:36,583 --> 00:36:43,375
is the spiritual part
where you are aiming at.

223
00:36:43,479 --> 00:36:51,865
 And then you make that jump unnaturally.
That means the organism is not ready for that

224
00:36:51,969 --> 00:37:01,406
 because still you're hurt, you hate people,
you are closed to yourself.

225
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:18,833
And then you say, I will seek God.
You can seek God but God is not there.

226
00:37:18,938 --> 00:37:30,833
It's here, you brought down God here and you say, please God stay with my weaknesses.

227
00:37:35,813 --> 00:37:48,281
Of course sometimes you may have an
 uplifting, the total cure maybe,

228
00:37:48,385 --> 00:37:54,792
I don't know, it's not my expertise.
But I say, it might be possible if

229
00:37:54,896 --> 00:38:03,021
 I see some healers or Christ let's
say. He was uplifting due to the power

230
00:38:03,125 --> 00:38:09,260
 of faith, was uplifting the body and
making the body function again

231
00:38:09,365 --> 00:38:13,604
in a very harmonic way.

232
00:38:14,656 --> 00:38:22,771
But I'm talking about whole, the
culture in the western world that

233
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:34,219
this emotional level is the most weak
because we left it totally uneducated.

234
00:38:34,323 --> 00:38:38,302
And because it's very weak,
 it's very vulnerable.

235
00:38:38,406 --> 00:38:50,281
So we have created through the years a
great predisposition for emotional problems

236
00:38:50,385 --> 00:38:58,354
and therefore even little cause
 can overturn the health.

237
00:38:58,458 --> 00:39:12,313
Sometimes you see a young woman,
she lost her first lover. What is the first lover?

238
00:39:12,417 --> 00:39:17,167
Later on, she will look upon this
and say, that was nothing.

239
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:22,167
Yet at the time that she is
involved with this problem,

240
00:39:22,271 --> 00:39:27,969
the health is going to
 break into pieces.

241
00:39:36,813 --> 00:39:47,104
-So it would be correct to understand that the emotional level is the center of problem?

242
00:39:47,208 --> 00:39:49,104
 This is where we have to come first?

243
00:39:49,208 --> 00:39:54,896
Because in the emotional level
we carry the most difficult things to touch?

244
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,979
And would you say that we're carrying
them through childhood

245
00:39:59,083 --> 00:40:16,031
about the age of 5 years, what happened
 then? How it creates the pain?

246
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:22,323
-This is another subject but I will
tell you my ideas very fast.

247
00:40:22,427 --> 00:40:30,375
I feel and I believe that we are the
end wave of the human race

248
00:40:30,479 --> 00:40:39,219
that comes 5million years back.
We are living now in the world

249
00:40:39,323 --> 00:40:44,594
and we are at the end.
We carry at a certain level,

250
00:40:44,698 --> 00:40:51,375
we carry all this human tradition
behind us. That's one kind of predisposition.

251
00:40:51,479 --> 00:41:00,302
The next kind of predisposition that
we create, is the physical

252
00:41:00,406 --> 00:41:07,833
that comes from the parents and
grand parents, specific predisposition.

253
00:41:07,938 --> 00:41:14,354
 That's another, you add that. And then,
there are the predispositions which

254
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:27,187
are formed because of social behavior
around us. I was raised in such a way

255
00:41:27,292 --> 00:41:43,531
that this happened. We all attribute a
lot of our problems in younger life

256
00:41:43,635 --> 00:41:48,729
which is true in a way.

257
00:41:48,833 --> 00:41:58,146
Though I feel that this issue has
been exaggerated too much

258
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:04,854
because of the psychotherapy, the
psychiatry etc. It has been exaggerated,

259
00:42:04,958 --> 00:42:14,646
 it's not that much. You find individuals
who have been hurt as children and

260
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:23,198
this is important but how much important
 it is to justify for other things that happen? No.

261
00:42:23,302 --> 00:42:31,010
Eventually we are, out of free will, deciding
to live one or another kind of life

262
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:37,688
and then we create this
predisposition more and more.

263
00:42:37,792 --> 00:42:47,750
Drink alcohol you make a predisposition
to your liver totally vulnerable,

264
00:42:47,854 --> 00:42:51,750
this is a predisposition here.
 Even if you stop drinking alcohol

265
00:42:51,854 --> 00:43:01,198
your liver is going to be affected easily
so you have a stress on this level.

266
00:43:01,302 --> 00:43:06,750
Your liver will break down,
  cancer of the liver.

267
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:16,104
-I'd like to add something in what you said
 about the woman who is spiritually very high

268
00:43:16,208 --> 00:43:28,354
 but emotionally very weak. For me I also
think that the spiritual part is also lacking

269
00:43:28,458 --> 00:43:36,385
in our bringing up, from the very beginning
and we don't have a connection with the

270
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:42,688
spiritual awareness and that's why is so
difficult to get the connection again.

271
00:43:42,792 --> 00:43:45,646
We are struggling very much and we never
 really got any connection in our up bringing.

272
00:43:49,635 --> 00:43:58,146
 And also religion really helps to recreate
 this connection or to re-establish

273
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:04,021
I think the spiritual education is an
important factor from the very beginning

274
00:44:04,125 --> 00:44:10,292
or we should not over emphasize the
 emotional factor relating to this?

275
00:44:11,094 --> 00:44:21,146
-I totally agree. When you have
eventually healthy individuals,

276
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:22,813
the need of a healthy person will be a
spiritual need. And the spiritual need

277
00:44:22,917 --> 00:44:38,167
 of a healthy person is totally different
from the spiritual need of a hippy.

278
00:44:41,583 --> 00:44:50,438
Spiritual need of hippies I have a problem
and I feel it comes through a reaction

279
00:44:50,542 --> 00:44:58,625
  to the conflict on the emotional level. What I'm talking about here, is causes of disease.

280
00:44:59,125 --> 00:45:03,573
When we come to the healthy attitude, what
 is the healthy attitude of a human being

281
00:45:03,677 --> 00:45:06,417
then we have a different discussion.

282
00:45:06,521 --> 00:45:13,792
But talking about exciting causes of disease
 and I say, this can be an exciting cause,

283
00:45:13,896 --> 00:45:29,417
the search for spiritual enlightenment it can be so, I'll put it very down to earth, so selfish.

284
00:45:29,521 --> 00:45:36,073
As much selfish as here, or here, or here.

285
00:45:36,177 --> 00:45:41,438
You want something for which
you are not prepared,

286
00:45:41,542 --> 00:45:52,479
 it does not belong to you yet and
you say, 'I love my wife or my husband.

287
00:45:52,583 --> 00:46:04,438
 I want this husband, wife, friend forever'.
You have to deserve it.

288
00:46:04,542 --> 00:46:13,833
How you deserve it? It's another story
how you deserve this survival here.

289
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:19,396
Here, there are people who are surviving
in the planet at this moment,

290
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:33,604
with this area in a good condition.
These are the simplest people on earth.

291
00:46:35,656 --> 00:46:39,438
 You will not find them in our societies.
You will find them in her society.

292
00:46:39,542 --> 00:46:49,927
You will find them in South America, in remote villages, people who know what is right,

293
00:46:50,031 --> 00:46:57,240
what is wrong, I cannot do that. But you
will earn so much money you can do this.

294
00:46:57,344 --> 00:47:05,552
I cannot do it. He is stupid. He is not
stupid, he is healthy on that level.

295
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:09,771
They say, I cannot go against
my emotions, my conscience.

296
00:47:09,875 --> 00:47:16,583
My conscience says, that I cannot do
that and I don't want to go against.

297
00:47:24,125 --> 00:47:36,865
-Study the Buddhist tradition I was
quite interested. I bought literature,

298
00:47:38,542 --> 00:47:49,729
started to practice, to meditate and this
 continued for about half a year and then

299
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:59,615
 I felt intuitively that at first I have to be full,
 to then be able to become empty

300
00:47:59,719 --> 00:48:07,438
and so I stopped with it.
 It was not the right time.

301
00:48:07,542 --> 00:48:14,208
I have to be filled first, emotionally filled,
then I can become empty.

302
00:48:15,208 --> 00:48:21,583
-Exactly, this is what I'm saying, jumping
a level beforehand and going into...

303
00:48:21,688 --> 00:48:28,531
it is so tempting to be free.

304
00:48:28,635 --> 00:48:39,104
They say come and practice this and you will
 be free. What do they really mean with this?

305
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:49,146
 It's a matter of great debate. You will be enlightened and you will have such

306
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:56,969
a connection with God. I have seen
 people who have gone through

307
00:48:57,073 --> 00:49:05,063
such periods and they feel elated.

308
00:49:05,167 --> 00:49:12,417
But this feeling elated and feel good,
puts aside the real problem,

309
00:49:12,521 --> 00:49:18,396
does not deal with the real problem
and the real problem comes back.

310
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:25,615
And the real problem usually is here.
You see, these people why they give up?

311
00:49:25,719 --> 00:49:36,552
Even the gurus, you know what is the problem? They go with disciples, a little girl.

312
00:49:36,656 --> 00:49:47,688
The guru doesn't go with one. He goes
with 1,2,3.. in the 10th everybody knows

313
00:49:47,792 --> 00:49:59,656
what's going on. That means that the guru is honest but he has not worked through this.

314
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:09,063
 That means he has still the desire to go
with a young girl. Once you have that,

315
00:50:09,167 --> 00:50:15,438
 it will follow you all the time and
 it's better don't become a guru.

316
00:50:15,542 --> 00:50:25,302
You say, wait a moment I'm not a guru,
 I'm not a saint, I'm not perfect.

317
00:50:25,406 --> 00:50:29,240
But nobody does this because they
 exploit and once they come to this level,

318
00:50:29,344 --> 00:50:36,094
they become sick on that level,
the guru and their disciples.

319
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:48,500
Now we are entering that era where
everybody is dealing with these issues.

320
00:50:48,604 --> 00:50:54,208
Why are you listening all of you? Because
 you all have thought about these issues.

321
00:51:01,604 --> 00:51:10,073
 That's why you are listening;
otherwise you would be sleeping.

322
00:51:11,073 --> 00:51:19,260
So we have entered that era of spiritual
 search, of the need for evolution.

323
00:51:19,365 --> 00:51:25,042
We had enough wars, we had enough
 fighting, we had enough hate,

324
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:34,219
 we don't want it anymore. So what
shall we do? This is the idea behind.

325
00:51:34,323 --> 00:51:46,021
We had enough conflict. What shall we do ?
Ok, find God. Each one finds an outlet.

326
00:51:46,125 --> 00:51:55,969
From healing point of view I say that Homeopathy is necessary to allow you

327
00:51:56,458 --> 00:52:03,385
that passage to this level,
in a healthy way finally.

328
00:52:07,031 --> 00:52:11,104
-I think it's different in the western
world than in the eastern world.

329
00:52:11,208 --> 00:52:18,219
It's a matter of feeling. I think we forgot
to feel the right way and to connect it

330
00:52:18,323 --> 00:52:25,604
into the intellect first, in order to get
healthy and then the spiritual can come up.

331
00:52:26,656 --> 00:52:35,302
-That's what we are saying exactly.
 I like this clearness.

332
00:52:35,406 --> 00:52:40,688
At a certain level we are
clear to certain things.

333
00:52:40,792 --> 00:52:50,323
I'm very clear in what I say and if this
clarity goes through, I'm very happy.

334
00:52:50,427 --> 00:52:55,531
You have something to work, if you want to accept it or not to accept, this is up to you.

335
00:52:55,635 --> 00:53:02,677
But as long as this is clear to you,
as it is to me, what I'm saying.

336
00:53:09,167 --> 00:53:14,792
-I just wanted to say that my master who is
the nephew of Ramakrishna and his master

337
00:53:14,896 --> 00:53:21,552
who is Mahashi and he is enlightened himself,
 he says exactly what you are saying.

338
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:26,771
You need a healthy body and a healthy mind
to come to this point where you start

339
00:53:26,875 --> 00:53:29,563
 'enquiring who am I'?

340
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:38,417
-I believe all people who are honest and
who are quite healthy they will be thinking

341
00:53:38,521 --> 00:53:41,792
  more or less in same lines.

342
00:53:54,563 --> 00:53:59,500
-I would like to come back for a short
question about emotional level.

343
00:53:59,604 --> 00:54:06,521
You told us we should not exaggerate in the
early childhood and blame everything on this.

344
00:54:06,625 --> 00:54:14,750
And you say, we have free will to
decide but here there is a point.

345
00:54:14,854 --> 00:54:17,000
You see, we are not really free if we are
 controlled by demons and things that

346
00:54:17,104 --> 00:54:25,906
you haven't touched yet. So we are not really free and there is a cause for people to not

347
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:31,969
 educate and touch it  at school and even after, this is the most difficult part to touch.

348
00:54:32,073 --> 00:54:37,969
So as long as we are controlled by
demons and repressed emotions

349
00:54:38,073 --> 00:54:42,500
we will not be able to go higher in other levels.

350
00:54:43,271 --> 00:54:48,906
-I understand perfectly what you say and it is
 true in a way but I have seen with Homeopathy

351
00:54:49,010 --> 00:54:57,552
that you say, I have this, this or this. I have compulsory ideas or I have depression

352
00:54:57,656 --> 00:55:13,281
because of a child abuse, that is the worst
 case. And yet you give Nat-m and next day,

353
00:55:13,385 --> 00:55:24,271
you forget about this. She described in the
 video, I felt free, I felt so happy. Where is that?

354
00:55:24,375 --> 00:55:32,063
It's a chemistry finally which is produced
 through thinking, through feelings,

355
00:55:32,167 --> 00:55:37,063
we change the chemistry. We come
 with Homeopathy, we rearrange

356
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:46,458
 the chemistry and the way of thinking
 changes. You say, I don't have this.

357
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:52,885
I don't want to come to my personal
story because many times I heard

358
00:55:52,990 --> 00:55:59,688
'oh poor child he was born in orphanage
and that's why now he is criminal and..',

359
00:56:01,406 --> 00:56:08,615
 I don't believe this. I lost both
my parents during the war.

360
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:13,396
 I don't think I have so many problems
because I lost my parents.

361
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:19,271
 It never came to my mind, I have a
problem and that problem maybe is because

362
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:22,927
I lost my parents. It never came to my mind.

363
00:56:23,031 --> 00:56:29,938
So how can, whatever I have, blame the Germans? The Germans killed my mother.

364
00:56:32,146 --> 00:56:40,198
If I want excuses for my inadequacies,
for this or that, I can tell whatever I like.

365
00:56:40,302 --> 00:56:52,260
But the fact remains for me that Homeopathy
 can eliminate a lot of what we call,

366
00:56:52,365 --> 00:57:00,833
deep hurts of the emotional level.
For me it is a fact and that is

367
00:57:00,938 --> 00:57:05,281
what I'm trying to drive in at, here.

368
00:57:05,385 --> 00:57:45,021
Also I was seeking at 1950, I was 18,
at 52, I was 20 actually and I read a book

369
00:57:45,125 --> 00:57:52,240
in spirituality and I wanted to go to
 India. Because there I'll find truth.

370
00:57:52,344 --> 00:58:02,833
 I have been through all this.
I was a prerunner of the hippy movement.

371
00:58:04,896 --> 00:58:10,396
I realized later on that the hippies were
doing exactly the same thing as I did

372
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:20,563
10 years before them. But I did not go to find excuses and taking drugs to find the paradise.

373
00:58:21,031 --> 00:58:31,729
And I also found out that it was the
wrong search for spirituality. I mean,

374
00:58:31,833 --> 00:58:42,146
you are asking spirituality because you
cannot solve your emotional problems.

375
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:50,396
That's true and when I had to think for
myself and look at others also,

376
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:57,865
 I realized that this is true,
I'm trying to jump a level.

377
00:58:57,969 --> 00:59:04,635
Actually I had a spiritual experience by that
 time because I was practicing very hard,

378
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:10,646
I was celibate. You know to be
celibate at the age of 21,

379
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:16,198
not having sex at all, no masturbation,
 nothing is something very...

380
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:25,438
And I had what we call spiritual
experience and  it was so powerful

381
00:59:25,542 --> 00:59:31,188
 that I heard almost a voice,
it said 'not now. You are not ready'.

382
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:51,833
What I tell you is experience either personal
or from sick people I've treated, it's no stories.

383
00:59:52,875 --> 01:00:01,167
-What you are saying actually is that Homeopathy has this mysterious process

384
01:00:01,271 --> 01:00:08,021
in which we can give up the demon
and go ahead  which I, for years,

385
01:00:08,125 --> 01:00:14,948
 try to find out how to do it better.
Now if Homeopathy has that process,

386
01:00:15,052 --> 01:00:19,698
 this is a real revolution for me.

387
01:00:23,969 --> 01:00:33,354
-I will tell you something. The demons and
all these feelings and ideas and thoughts

388
01:00:33,458 --> 01:00:39,271
which are tormenting us are
like the dark part in us,

389
01:00:39,375 --> 01:00:53,250
  the death in us. We have death
inside us like life. Death is like darkness.

390
01:00:57,458 --> 01:01:05,438
Put light in the dark. What is remaining?
Nothing. This is what happens with

391
01:01:05,542 --> 01:01:11,833
Homeopathy. That dark disappears
 and you don't know where it is.

392
01:01:11,938 --> 01:01:22,875
You say, I had these thoughts, where are they now? They've gone. It's as simple as that.

393
01:01:24,208 --> 01:01:34,875
And from this point some of my students
come and say, everything is delusion.

394
01:01:37,188 --> 01:01:43,938
So find why you have a pain
in the right shoulder.

395
01:01:44,042 --> 01:01:49,688
Because you have a specific
 delusion, find the delusion.

396
01:01:49,792 --> 01:02:06,604
This is taking a real idea and make it
 a play and then you start thinking

397
01:02:06,708 --> 01:02:16,969
'if I have this what it symbolizes'?
And then you can get crazy.

398
01:02:17,708 --> 01:02:23,792
 But if you have here a pain that means
you are quite healthy in mental-emotional.

399
01:02:23,896 --> 01:02:30,813
Because people with pains
on the joints are the most healthy.

400
01:02:30,917 --> 01:02:38,458
 With lumbagos, sciaticas, are the most
 healthy. Why do I have the lumbago?

401
01:02:38,563 --> 01:02:41,729
I cannot carry the life
of my delusion and bla bla bla....

402
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:50,083
 and then you can become really
 mentally ill, if you go through that process.

403
01:02:50,188 --> 01:02:52,875
I never said such things.

404
01:02:53,917 --> 01:03:03,865
Just to complete a little bit more, to give you
a more complete idea of the exciting cause

405
01:03:03,969 --> 01:03:11,708
and the seriousness of the disease, the connection with the exciting cause.

406
01:03:11,813 --> 01:03:27,938
Once we have problems arising from
survival instinct, on the physical level

407
01:03:35,375 --> 01:03:49,354
then the diseases that we have are more manageable with Homeopathy.

408
01:03:49,458 --> 01:04:01,354
If you have the emotional conflict or the
sexual conflict, it becomes more complicated

409
01:04:01,458 --> 01:04:14,552
and most of it is the spiritual. The spiritual
 conflict is cases where you feel

410
01:04:14,656 --> 01:04:24,667
 more and more the problem that you
cannot see through the case.

411
01:04:24,958 --> 01:04:36,417
People who have been trying to reach a
 spiritual goal, they have gone through

412
01:04:36,521 --> 01:04:55,792
these emotional conflicts, they have
 left them behind, it is like a bunch

413
01:04:56,740 --> 01:05:12,531
where you cannot see through a pattern.
And there you get most of these cases

414
01:05:12,635 --> 01:05:31,146
that we call today the intellectuals.
In this area are the intellectuals.

415
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:40,531
Those people who intellectually try to find
 a solution for their inner problems.

416
01:05:40,635 --> 01:05:48,833
These are cases where, if you see them,
you are going to have a difficult case to solve.

417
01:05:48,938 --> 01:06:08,323
Why? Because they've gone through
 a process which is not natural.

418
01:06:10,385 --> 01:06:18,990
And the trail that was left
behind is not a clean trail.

419
01:06:23,677 --> 01:06:33,146
Also here, in this level, you get people
whose cases are quite difficult.

420
01:06:33,917 --> 01:06:39,292
Because on the emotional level
you don't have the phenomenon

421
01:06:39,396 --> 01:06:48,104
of once it gets hurt, it's finished.
You get a phenomenon that once

422
01:06:48,208 --> 01:06:55,063
 there is a hurt and stays inside,  is every
day and it is aggravating every day.

423
01:06:55,167 --> 01:07:02,427
You have the torment of these
thoughts, of these experiences.

424
01:07:10,792 --> 01:07:23,302
A mother has a child who is retarded.
She comes there and you give Nat-m.

425
01:07:23,406 --> 01:07:29,750
or Ign. and she does quite well. You will
have to expect due to the fact that

426
01:07:29,854 --> 01:07:36,229
the emotional problem is there, it is not
solved, it is an objective emotional problem

427
01:07:36,333 --> 01:07:43,969
that you may have a
relapse with this case.

428
01:07:44,073 --> 01:07:55,885
The same if the problem is real,
objective and it's on the emotional level,

429
01:07:55,990 --> 01:08:01,698
 then you're going to have a
difficult case in hand.

430
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:20,656
 But if such an individual whom you treat, becomes quite healthy and is able to evolve,

431
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:32,917
 that means to see the world from
another point of view, then it's saved.

432
01:08:33,365 --> 01:08:47,656
 Then you may not have the relapses again.
 That means acceptance on this level.

433
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:54,437
I accept I have a child and I'm happy
in spite of the fact that it is a retarded

434
01:08:54,542 --> 01:08:59,198
child and I'll try to do my best.
 This is a healthy attitude,

435
01:08:59,302 --> 01:09:07,500
it is a spiritual attitude and the problem is
 solved. Homeopathy will give the possibility

436
01:09:07,604 --> 01:09:14,885
for this person to jump into that level.
If he grasps the possibility, he is saved.

437
01:09:14,990 --> 01:09:21,865
If he doesn't grasp, he stays with 'why me,
 why was I chosen by God to have this

438
01:09:21,969 --> 01:09:30,552
catastrophy, this calamity all the day?'
If she sticks to that idea then the relapse

439
01:09:30,656 --> 01:09:39,479
is necessary. You will tell me,
why do we need all these?

440
01:09:39,583 --> 01:09:48,594
Unless you understand in this way, you
will not be able to deal with cases.

441
01:09:48,698 --> 01:09:52,531
Because you will see relapses, you don't
know why they are, you will see phenomena

442
01:09:52,635 --> 01:10:02,219
which you cannot explain. You do not
 know what to say to the patient

443
01:10:02,323 --> 01:10:09,354
and you are lost, try again with
another remedy and then full relapse,

444
01:10:09,458 --> 01:10:13,063
then disappointment of the patient,
 he leaves you, he goes either to

445
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:21,302
another homeopath or to accupuncture
 or back to allopathic drugging.

446
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:34,708
There are a lot of questions which I would think you may have and I don't see these questions.

447
01:10:44,875 --> 01:10:51,813
-I would like to know what would determine
in the individual to grasp the opportunity

448
01:10:51,917 --> 01:10:59,396
or not to grasp? Is a predisposition?
 If we suppose the remedy is the right one.

449
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:05,281
He will always take the opportunity
or he sometimes will take it or not,

450
01:11:05,385 --> 01:11:08,208
is it the amount of pain or what?

451
01:11:09,250 --> 01:11:23,865
-It's a good question. The answer is almost beyond logic and our possibility for analysis.

452
01:11:23,969 --> 01:11:36,354
What will determine whether an individual
will evolve or not, as an individual spiritually,

453
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:43,500
 is very difficult for us to pinpoint.  To say it
 is hereditary or whatever reasons are there.

454
01:11:44,792 --> 01:11:51,250
You know the Indian philosophy says,
 it's your karma, your good karma

455
01:11:51,417 --> 01:11:58,479
or your bad karma who did this or that.
These are some explanations,

456
01:11:58,583 --> 01:12:05,531
 it might be valid explanations but I'm
not in a position logically to argue

457
01:12:05,635 --> 01:12:15,771
 about such or another position.
At this moment I like to stay with what is

458
01:12:15,875 --> 01:12:23,365
really logical and what everybody can understand without much doubt.

459
01:12:23,469 --> 01:12:30,021
Of course the idea of karma makes
you feel quite good

460
01:12:30,125 --> 01:12:35,385
and reincarnation makes
you feel even better.

461
01:12:35,490 --> 01:12:43,656
I know that. I know that you say 'I'm
suffering this time because most probably

462
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:49,375
I was misbehaving in my past life but
 then next life most probably

463
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:56,813
 I will get the reward for this life that
 I am so good' and things like that.

464
01:12:56,917 --> 01:13:07,854
And also that I'm not lost. The idea of the unknown, the fear of death is minimized

465
01:13:07,958 --> 01:13:18,875
with these theories or religious
beliefs coming from India.

466
01:13:21,656 --> 01:13:28,354
Most probably there is some truth in it because
 if you see Mozart writing a symphony

467
01:13:28,458 --> 01:13:32,750
or playing the piano at the age
of 6 who taught him?

468
01:13:32,854 --> 01:13:40,396
 Nobody. Or some chess players at 6
they play like masters. What is this?

469
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:47,438
Something comes through the generations.
Some information comes through

470
01:13:47,542 --> 01:13:55,750
 from generation to generation which
according to our biophysical structure,

471
01:13:55,854 --> 01:13:59,771
we perceive this or not.
Maybe these things will be

472
01:13:59,875 --> 01:14:05,500
 explained later on; we are
able to enter in these realms.

473
01:14:05,604 --> 01:14:10,083
But it's a very difficult question for me
to answer. What will make an individual

474
01:14:10,188 --> 01:14:16,500
after the homeopathic remedy to
grasp the opportunity and

475
01:14:16,604 --> 01:14:25,542
proceed, spiritually
evolve in a correct way?

476
01:14:27,583 --> 01:14:35,479
-Since suffering is a process of life,
when you treat on emotional level

477
01:14:35,583 --> 01:14:41,198
what you do is not suppress the
emotions. You help the patient to deal

478
01:14:41,302 --> 01:14:46,063
with the emotions and therefore you
continue living a normal life

479
01:14:46,167 --> 01:14:52,302
but you have more strength
to carry on with your duty.

480
01:14:52,406 --> 01:15:03,125
-Correct. Treating somebody you
give him the possibility to deal

481
01:15:03,229 --> 01:15:13,396
with his emotions or fears etc.
But sometimes the fears are so much

482
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:18,167
 the result of chemistry that
the fears overwhelm the individual

483
01:15:18,271 --> 01:15:24,573
and it's not possible. He is trembling,
 'I'm going to die, I have cancer'.

484
01:15:24,677 --> 01:15:33,396
Then you give the remedy and then
suddenly, 'I'm not afraid of cancer anymore'.

485
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:41,198
Then they look upon their problems in a
much more concrete and complete way.

486
01:15:41,302 --> 01:15:51,354
 They are not lost in their fears. Later
on we shall be discussing about

487
01:15:51,458 --> 01:16:03,656
different objects that we shall find in
treating an individual homeopathically.

488
01:16:04,542 --> 01:16:15,354
We have cases where it will be very difficult
to make them really healthy and stay.

489
01:16:15,458 --> 01:16:20,302
They relapse all the time for different
 reasons. We have other individuals

490
01:16:20,406 --> 01:16:28,708
where we cannot find the remedy. Then
you have to go all around, treating, treating.

491
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:49,573
-If a patient after getting the remedy, loses
 life time fears and becomes very healthy,

492
01:16:49,677 --> 01:16:54,479
the fears are gone. This you see imme-
diately after the remedy it has been given

493
01:16:54,896 --> 01:17:03,240
to the patient, the freedom of asking
questions of how comes this happen?

494
01:17:03,344 --> 01:17:08,927
And because it is an ambiguous question
even to us, I'm not asking for an explanation

495
01:17:09,031 --> 01:17:18,323
as to how the remedy acts, but is it enough
to explain that you got it, you are better

496
01:17:18,427 --> 01:17:23,792
and therefore it acts. Or is it that we
can explain the patient why he was freed

497
01:17:23,896 --> 01:17:30,500
of a life time problem, suddenly
is over so simple.

498
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:40,573
-Well you can give an explanation
according to whom is in front of you.

499
01:17:42,052 --> 01:17:50,552
Simple people you can say, that the
chemistry of the brain was such,

500
01:17:50,656 --> 01:17:59,896
that it was creating these fears. Now we
fix that chemistry, you don't have the fears.

501
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:09,302
To somebody else you can talk in a different
 way because after all the true is that

502
01:18:09,406 --> 01:18:19,260
in order to have a real cure, something
 happens of an order of, how can I say,

503
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:32,302
a situation comes in the right time, the
right people to bring about that miracle.

504
01:18:32,406 --> 01:18:42,792
It's a kind of a miracle and it needs
something beyond the ordinary.

505
01:18:42,896 --> 01:18:49,417
 Extraordinary things happen and these extraordinary things may happen

506
01:18:49,521 --> 01:18:55,656
in a very simple way. You meet somebody
and you will have the experience.

507
01:18:55,760 --> 01:19:02,490
You meet somebody and you see
something very little, one of these things

508
01:19:02,542 --> 01:19:06,865
that we have been discussing and
you say, why don't you take Pulsatilla?

509
01:19:06,969 --> 01:19:13,146
He takes Pulsatilla and he says,
what was that? This was a little

510
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:19,365
divine moment where
synchronization took place

511
01:19:19,469 --> 01:19:22,510
and you prescribed
the correct remedy.

512
01:19:22,917 --> 01:19:33,010
 Now in order to have this as a profession,
you need to create that synchronicity

513
01:19:33,115 --> 01:19:43,656
inside you first and then it is created
outside. Then people are coming to you.

514
01:19:45,875 --> 01:19:54,396
 You give the remedy, again the miracle.
I'm supposed to know a little bit more

515
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:58,906
Homeopathy than you, but still I'm
trembling when I see a new case.

516
01:19:59,010 --> 01:20:05,813
Is it possible that in this case I will see
the remedy? And in 1,2,3 minutes

517
01:20:05,917 --> 01:20:10,240
you see the remedy thank God.
 And you get another case, you struggle,

518
01:20:10,344 --> 01:20:18,917
you struggle, this remedy or
that remedy, what is this?

519
01:20:21,031 --> 01:20:27,146
But if you have done your duty, that
means you really studied and you really

520
01:20:27,250 --> 01:20:32,729
got the information as much as you could,
then it's up to other forces whatever

521
01:20:33,458 --> 01:20:37,677
they maybe to allow or not to
allow. But if you say,

522
01:20:37,781 --> 01:20:45,948
'oh it's your karma not to be well'
because you do not recognize

523
01:20:46,052 --> 01:20:51,094
 a Calcarea carbonica case, it is the
karma of the person not to be well.

524
01:20:51,917 --> 01:20:57,219
It is a simple Calcarea carbonica case,
so why don't you recognize it?

525
01:20:57,323 --> 01:21:01,531
Because you do not have the
information, you did not study enough.

526
01:21:01,635 --> 01:21:10,979
You cannot say it's your karma, you
have to suffer. It's my karma because

527
01:21:11,083 --> 01:21:22,771
I don't say to myself 'I did not study enough
 and that's why I cannot find a simple remedy'.

528
01:21:22,875 --> 01:21:28,833
If it's a very difficult case really, ok.
But if it's a simple case and still you

529
01:21:28,938 --> 01:21:33,344
cannot solve it, whose fault it is?
The person who comes?

530
01:21:43,146 --> 01:21:50,312
-It is my own experience that on the
one hand there are these miracles

531
01:21:50,417 --> 01:21:58,260
where you give the remedy and many things happen but in reality actually I experience,

532
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:07,792
 you give a good remedy and still there
 is a lot of work to do to go very,

533
01:22:07,896 --> 01:22:14,531
very slowly through all this process. And
I think that this path where you have to work,

534
01:22:14,635 --> 01:22:22,281
the patient has to work, you with
your patient is correct and a good way too.

535
01:22:22,385 --> 01:22:30,531
I think we shouldn't think that everything
 is easy if we get the right remedy.

536
01:22:30,635 --> 01:22:35,833
I think the majority of cases is like that.

537
01:22:36,583 --> 01:22:44,406
-I agree. As I said before, we
don't always have a clear cut case

538
01:22:44,510 --> 01:22:51,771
and then we have to struggle and to
give a remedy which is one-sided as

539
01:22:51,875 --> 01:22:58,969
Hahnemann called. That means we don't
 have a full picture of the remedy and then

540
01:22:59,073 --> 01:23:02,615
you proceed and then you go a
little bit further and further.

541
01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:08,437
 And in the end you find a point
 where you give the right remedy

542
01:23:08,542 --> 01:23:12,719
and then there is this freedom.

543
01:23:16,875 --> 01:23:23,729
I gave a new definition of Health: Freedom.
You know how I came to that?

544
01:23:23,833 --> 01:23:32,188
Because my patients who were coming
in the very beginning to a great extent

545
01:23:32,292 --> 01:23:41,552
they would describe their new state, as
 freedom. I was living in a jail and I feel free.

546
01:23:41,656 --> 01:23:52,042
 I got out and this feeling of freedom
gave me the idea of the definition of Health

547
01:23:52,146 --> 01:23:58,896
which we have to have in 3 levels
 and I gave you the definition.

548
01:23:59,938 --> 01:24:04,438
It was by the patients
expressing that feeling.

549
01:24:04,542 --> 01:24:11,552
A person comes and after the first
remedy you give, ah I feel so good.

550
01:24:11,656 --> 01:24:14,646
Then he comes 2nd month,
follow up, still good.

551
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:18,896
3rd month good, 4th month,
I'm not so good anymore.

552
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:29,104
You have to judge at that moment,
it is exactly like somebody being in jail

553
01:24:29,208 --> 01:24:36,219
for 5 years, 10 years and then
he got out. The first day is a fantastic

554
01:24:36,323 --> 01:24:45,323
experience. As you stay free,
you get used to being free

555
01:24:45,667 --> 01:24:52,396
and it's not anymore that shock of first
time I'm free and then they start saying,

556
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:58,438
 'oh I don't feel so good'. Wait, if you
mislead to believe that now is the time

557
01:25:01,427 --> 01:25:07,500
 for the repetition of the remedy, most
probably you will be making a mistake.

558
01:25:07,969 --> 01:25:15,688
You will say' yes, but you cannot
live in ecstasy all the time'.

559
01:25:15,792 --> 01:25:23,104
You come and you are facing your
problems, you see what is happening etc.

560
01:25:23,208 --> 01:25:28,854
You cannot say, all the time I want to
be in that state, neither is possible.

561
01:25:28,958 --> 01:25:36,927
If you try to push your patient into going to
that state where he had first experienced,

562
01:25:37,031 --> 01:25:41,771
you are going to make a
 relapse, like her case.
