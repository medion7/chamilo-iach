1
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:33,387
25 countries welcome and I hope you will enjoy the course, the sun, the heat and the heat

2
00:00:33,687 --> 00:00:42,223
that is going be created inside here also due to some ideas.

3
00:00:44,423 --> 00:00:50,895
What is the topic? That’s a good question.

4
00:00:53,232 --> 00:00:56,399
As always I confess the truth.

5
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:08,752
I have to confess that until yesterday I had no idea what to say this morning

6
00:01:10,592 --> 00:01:31,343
because the first day always there is a speech on theory and the main teaching here is done through live cases.

7
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:46,056
You have come here as professionals to see live cases, how I take a case, how I analyze the case and how I prescribe.

8
00:01:47,599 --> 00:02:00,120
So most of the time you will be seeing live cases either for the first time or follow-ups.

9
00:02:01,215 --> 00:02:16,551
Because here due to the fact we do not have available a hospital in any country where one could see live cases

10
00:02:17,047 --> 00:02:28,991
we have to organize these courses in order that the professional homeopaths could see live cases

11
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:37,391
and not just see the case but also the follow-up which is the most important.

12
00:02:38,111 --> 00:02:48,319
Because the most of the problems we have as homeopaths are when we have prescribed a case,

13
00:02:50,975 --> 00:02:58,262
we have seen the reaction and then we have to decide what to do further in that case.

14
00:02:58,831 --> 00:03:10,136
This is the most difficult part for Homeopathy, find the first remedy maybe is the easiest part.

15
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:16,310
To know how to follow a case is quite difficult.

16
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:37,743
The reason is that our organisms have been compromised in our lives due to several factors

17
00:03:40,327 --> 00:03:58,583
that there is a confusion in the organisms that we see today as cases especially in Europe and the U.S.

18
00:04:05,887 --> 00:04:21,168
I want to make clear some points which will give you a different understanding from the understanding you have from the medical schools.

19
00:04:24,711 --> 00:04:35,320
When a child is born is a happy existence.

20
00:04:36,927 --> 00:04:52,311
All happy children are very healthy what you see is they are laughing, they are very happy.

21
00:04:54,383 --> 00:05:03,142
This is the primary goal in life. To be happy.

22
00:05:06,983 --> 00:05:25,055
Now, we intervene in these organisms in different ways and by interfering we compromise the defense mechanism,

23
00:05:27,271 --> 00:05:51,806
the immune system, finally we compromise the feeling of the well-being that we should be there all the time.

24
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:59,695
We become more and more anxious, depressed etc.

25
00:06:01,679 --> 00:06:18,567
We become angrier, hypochondriac, phobic… All this is not natural for human beings.

26
00:06:19,247 --> 00:06:24,726
The natural tendency is for us to be happy.

27
00:06:26,903 --> 00:06:40,512
The more we lose joy and happiness on the process of becoming adults then the more we have compromised our health.

28
00:06:43,343 --> 00:06:59,280
How this has happened? This has happened through interference from the very young age mostly with vaccination,

29
00:07:00,471 --> 00:07:13,640
through antibiotics, through strong drugs that compromise the immune system.

30
00:07:18,423 --> 00:07:29,720
Therefore my experience in treating patients and listening to the development of the pathology

31
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:47,087
which is in front of me I felt that this could not be just accidental. It must have had a kind of continuum.

32
00:07:49,343 --> 00:08:12,950
That means we are born happy and through several interferences finally we become unhappy, depressed, anxious, phobic and finally mentally disturbed.

33
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:29,079
Most of the population especially of the population of the western worlds has become so unhealthy.

34
00:08:31,031 --> 00:08:47,317
Therefore I asked what is happening and I wanted to understand and then I realized that what happens is that…

35
00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:17,549
By the time I was looking at the cases, don’t forget it was in the 1960s, by that time I could see the history of the patient

36
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:40,253
that he was having acutes repeatedly as a child and at a certain moment the acutes were stopping and chronic condition was manifesting.

37
00:09:43,781 --> 00:09:59,333
How this happens? It happens most probably because when the acutes were treated… tonsillitis with high fever in children,

38
00:10:02,517 --> 00:10:16,861
it’s the first system that gets infected, the respiratory system and what guards the respiratory system are the tonsils,

39
00:10:17,565 --> 00:10:33,941
tonsils are taking all the impact, high fevers, antibiotics and then next year 2 times antibiotics, next year 3 times antibiotics

40
00:10:35,061 --> 00:10:52,341
and 4-5 years when the boy is 14-15 no more high fevers. And everybody was happy except of the organism.

41
00:10:53,021 --> 00:11:17,388
The organism knew that something has happened in the whole mechanism of defense, the endothelial system, the neurovegetative system,

42
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:29,561
hormonal system, some changes have happened in 1 or2 of these systems that now the organism

43
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:42,998
would not react anymore to staphylococcus or streptococcus that was happening the previous years.

44
00:11:48,565 --> 00:12:09,933
I thought what happens is that the organism through the suppression with antibiotics of the acute conditions they have been traumatized,

45
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:33,101
harassed and they could not anymore react to an invention of the bacteria that were causing the high fever.

46
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:52,334
In the meantime what we knew from the theory of Homeopathy was that if you prescribe correctly in a case then sometimes

47
00:12:53,774 --> 00:13:04,374
an old condition manifests again, an old condition that was with high fever.

48
00:13:06,237 --> 00:13:19,269
So you prescribe a remedy and suddenly though for 10-15 years the person did not have any high fever suddenly he develops high fever.

49
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:28,821
So, when we see this we say that’s perfect. This was not known before.

50
00:13:30,429 --> 00:13:46,038
It was not known that if fever returns that means the immune system has been again complete, has recovered.

51
00:13:50,557 --> 00:14:10,037
This is quite understandable, quite simple but if we proceed further to the analysis of this state we see that later on

52
00:14:14,109 --> 00:14:35,093
we have the development of chronic headaches, migraines and he takes painkillers.

53
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:56,349
When I have a headache I take a painkiller and then there is a time after lots of painkillers suppressing the migraines,

54
00:14:58,365 --> 00:15:05,053
a more serious chronic condition develops.

55
00:15:05,677 --> 00:15:24,461
What can it be? We have the manifestation of autoimmune diseases, neuromuscular diseases, cancer, malignancies of all types

56
00:15:29,405 --> 00:15:42,453
and then we wonder why in our societies there are so many people suffering of malignant blood pressure, with heart conditions.

57
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:55,764
Who is free from such conditions? Once you examine a person over 50 you can hardly find anyone

58
00:15:56,581 --> 00:16:09,277
who is free from taking drugs to cover up the condition.

59
00:16:18,085 --> 00:16:30,938
What has actually happened in the organism… If there is a treatment of an acute or a chronic condition

60
00:16:32,178 --> 00:16:50,905
and that treatment is not according to the nature, what nature wants but it’s against it that means if nature wants to have a high fever

61
00:16:51,361 --> 00:17:03,530
for 5 days before it can go over it and the second day you do not allow the fever to go on and you start giving antibiotics,

62
00:17:04,473 --> 00:17:14,849
what happens is that the organism is in a turmoil and is forced not to show the fever.

63
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:29,353
That means you have killed all the bacteria and together with them who are causing the fever you have killed some useful bacteria

64
00:17:29,889 --> 00:17:39,666
that now will start developing problems of a chronic condition.

65
00:17:43,954 --> 00:17:55,730
If a disease has not been cured in a natural way and if that disease was a serious acute condition

66
00:17:57,265 --> 00:18:18,824
then always you will have the imprint on the organism of that moment which will reappear after your good prescription

67
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:27,033
even after 20 years that this suppression has taken place.

68
00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:46,537
That means with every treatment which is not natural, which you do not allow the organism to go through it, suffer as much as needed

69
00:18:47,281 --> 00:19:19,401
in order to have an auto-cure then you invariably inflict upon the organism a problem that in its place manifests another condition

70
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:25,808
which is much worse than the acute.

71
00:19:29,337 --> 00:19:50,289
All this idea gave me the idea of writing a few years ago the continuum of a unified theory of the diseases.

72
00:19:51,777 --> 00:19:55,673
I don’t know if anybody has read this article.

73
00:19:59,801 --> 00:20:13,705
I will send you the link of the medical journal that has published this, so you can download it and fully read it.

74
00:20:19,273 --> 00:20:31,818
Through the life of a person, from birth to death, there is a continuum, a sequence of natural diseases, acute and chronic.

75
00:20:32,937 --> 00:20:38,600
When acute diseases are not properly treated and the patient has a weakened immune system,

76
00:20:39,274 --> 00:20:44,353
the over-all health of the individual is permanently compromised.

77
00:20:46,057 --> 00:20:52,601
According to this understanding you see what we have done.

78
00:20:54,129 --> 00:21:12,857
We said we don’t want to have chickenpox and therefore we have a vaccination that will not allow the organism to develop chickenpox

79
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:22,330
or scarlatina or whooping-cough or mumps, not any children’s epidemic diseases.

80
00:21:23,777 --> 00:21:34,633
I was born as you know in 1932 and by that time there were no vaccination.

81
00:21:35,321 --> 00:21:42,921
There were just natural epidemic acute diseases that all children had to go through.

82
00:21:46,042 --> 00:21:50,369
I was fortunate to be born during that time.

83
00:21:57,009 --> 00:22:13,295
The vaccinations do not allow the development of acute diseases which the organism had to go through itself

84
00:22:14,263 --> 00:22:27,600
and of course either will survive or die. This is the natural selection.

85
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:45,015
We are living in that opportunity of living in a world that the population of earth is determined

86
00:22:46,232 --> 00:22:56,032
how many will survive and die but what we call a natural selection.

87
00:23:01,231 --> 00:23:10,938
So a child who could not go through an acute epidemic would die of course.

88
00:23:16,843 --> 00:23:22,306
I see your eyes asking now what do you suggest? Let the children die?

89
00:23:27,251 --> 00:23:51,899
Today, we have become so sick in our minds that instead of having natural selection we have war selection.

90
00:23:55,051 --> 00:24:13,843
We select by bombs. We select by killing, smashing lives of people indifferently whether they are healthy or sick, it doesn’t matter.

91
00:24:14,235 --> 00:24:18,731
War selection is not anymore natural selection.

92
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:32,787
But who thinks of the war? Ask yourselves, can I kill somebody? Bring yourself in such a state…

93
00:24:38,459 --> 00:24:44,098
Maybe a Stram. would like to kill somebody.

94
00:24:45,307 --> 00:24:53,507
But a person who is considerably healthy is impossible to think that I have in front of me somebody and I want to kill

95
00:24:54,307 --> 00:24:57,810
or I don’t care if I kill or not.

96
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:19,058
It’s not possible. The minds of the people who conceive the wars are sick minds that we have produced through scientific medicine, unfortunately.

97
00:25:19,827 --> 00:25:34,059
This is the fact. This is the truth. But my child is alive.

98
00:25:35,842 --> 00:25:54,010
Yes, it is alive but what is the cost? You have a child that at the age of 12-15 because of his natural disease

99
00:25:54,722 --> 00:26:09,586
which is in the mind he will go into narcotics, drugs, fights and killings.

100
00:26:12,379 --> 00:26:20,316
The U.S., Bill Clinton had confessed that he was taking drugs.

101
00:26:26,562 --> 00:26:32,010
I cannot imagine that a person who is happy will go and take drugs.

102
00:26:35,043 --> 00:26:49,107
Why? To become unhappy? Who wants to become unhappy? Why people are going to drugs? The young population…

103
00:26:49,571 --> 00:27:03,251
When I was teaching in the U.S. I said to the class, about this size, who has taken drugs? You know the Americans are very open.

104
00:27:03,786 --> 00:27:08,642
Everybody raised his hand, the whole class, there was no exemption.

105
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:13,283
I could not find one that said I did not take drugs.

106
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:34,323
Why? Marijuana? Marijuana is good… they want to make marijuana legal to gain what? Because the people will not be exploited.

107
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:55,402
And then free cocaine, then eventually the whole world goes mad, we kill each other, we throw nuclear bombs and we’re finished.

108
00:28:01,003 --> 00:28:05,803
I have been thinking all these and I wrote this article.

109
00:28:07,123 --> 00:28:11,282
And I said why this is happening? We have to find the reason.

110
00:28:11,594 --> 00:28:19,410
Why are we in such a state and we have to find a way out.

111
00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:29,555
Otherwise the time is running very fast and we are going to kill each other very soon.

112
00:28:33,947 --> 00:28:44,875
What is the alternative? Except of other alternatives for which I know

113
00:28:45,235 --> 00:28:56,163
but I don’t know their impact Homeopathy has the possibility to cure a person.

114
00:28:58,635 --> 00:29:10,987
What has happened with Homeopathy? Homeopathy can have impressive results. Not always.

115
00:29:14,763 --> 00:29:29,091
But what has happened and Homeopathy is not accepted on a global level and not practiced on global level

116
00:29:29,499 --> 00:29:43,811
since it is such a fantastic treatment? I’ll go to another subject.

117
00:29:49,275 --> 00:30:06,691
When you give a remedy what is the parameter that will tell you that your remedy has a correct reaction?

118
00:30:11,547 --> 00:30:27,083
What you want to see in the person to make certain for yourself that your remedy was acting towards the right direction?

119
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:44,917
You remember the direction we said in the beginning, when the child is born is happy so unless the direction is towards this,

120
00:30:45,829 --> 00:31:06,853
making the person more happy, joyful, complete inside, unless you aim at this your remedy is either wrong

121
00:31:07,717 --> 00:31:25,853
or the organism you are treating is yet not able to attain the state of joy and happiness. And you have to struggle more.

122
00:31:27,149 --> 00:32:00,021
I’ll give an example. Sep. is a remedy that is over-sexual or under-sexual? Under-sexual, usually there is an aversion to sex.

123
00:32:02,637 --> 00:32:13,038
So a case comes to you and one of the main problems is that she has aversion to sex.

124
00:32:13,661 --> 00:32:36,629
She’s married , she still has sex, she never enjoyed it, never had an orgasm and such a person creates a social situation around her,

125
00:32:38,101 --> 00:32:54,901
is a woman who is not caring about the husband, whether the husband is flirting, running away, because she doesn’t care.

126
00:33:02,182 --> 00:33:16,482
So you prescribe the remedy and the remedy is correct and the hormonal system that had so low estrogens is reviving

127
00:33:17,594 --> 00:33:29,882
and the woman for the first time feels the pleasure of sex. You know what is going to happen by that time?

128
00:33:30,474 --> 00:33:37,249
Is she going to be happy? No. She starts being unhappy now.

129
00:33:40,937 --> 00:33:57,889
Because she realizes that she is jealous with her husband and every time her husband looks… So she will come back to you to tell you

130
00:33:58,433 --> 00:34:11,737
I’m unhappy and then you will say what is happening to you, suddenly I feel so much jealous about my husband

131
00:34:12,729 --> 00:34:25,002
that I can’t sleep, cannot let it out of my mind that he may be running away. The husband may not be running away but Lach.

132
00:34:25,378 --> 00:34:29,945
will imagine that her husband is running with somebody else.

133
00:34:32,009 --> 00:34:37,249
And then you give Lach.

134
00:34:45,217 --> 00:34:54,770
I speak about a case which is quite healthy because there are others more complicated patients, but after Lach.

135
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:20,057
the enjoyment for sex will continue without this tantalizing effect of jealousy so much but the disturbance now will start manifesting in the physical body.

136
00:35:22,881 --> 00:35:29,449
In what form? It may take any form. It may take any form.

137
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:42,930
It might be the hormonal system, muscular system, joints, neuromuscular system, anything!

138
00:35:44,721 --> 00:35:57,737
But the physical body will be taking most of the force because this organism has been undermined through their life,

139
00:35:58,961 --> 00:36:08,969
their mother and father and hereditary condition, to such an extent that one remedy is not going to be enough,

140
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:27,578
second remedy is not going to be enough then it ends up in a rheumatoid arthritis that you need to treat most probably.

141
00:36:27,865 --> 00:36:34,473
You have to treat that for a few years before the whole organism is completely free of disease.

142
00:36:35,185 --> 00:36:44,936
Now, we have at our disposal such a system.

143
00:36:47,297 --> 00:37:00,244
We have a system where when a child has high fever we go along with his reaction and we’ll give a remedy

144
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:09,771
which produces high fever Bell., Acon., Stram. or Calc.

145
00:37:10,555 --> 00:37:18,483
Then the fever goes out and there is no trauma left.

146
00:37:20,508 --> 00:37:33,316
You suppress it; you leave a trauma, you let it express through Homeopathy the similar remedy

147
00:37:33,915 --> 00:37:40,419
because the similar remedy produces the same impulse within the body the impulse of the body

148
00:37:40,747 --> 00:37:53,228
when attacked by a microbe is to create a totality of symptoms and that similar totality has been produced by the remedy.

149
00:37:53,413 --> 00:38:09,541
You give it and you force the organism to express it, you help the organism to express and fight the disease.

150
00:38:11,888 --> 00:38:25,408
Can you imagine a system of medicine which is accepted globally that takes this child from the very beginning

151
00:38:26,128 --> 00:38:43,808
and treats it in a natural way and then you will have no traumas left into the body? This is not all.

152
00:38:44,320 --> 00:39:03,888
Because the traumas, “τραύμα” is a Greek word, when I want to pronounce it with English pronunciation I cannot pronounce it.

153
00:39:04,591 --> 00:39:16,336
I don’t know if it is traumas… The Greek word is “τραύμα”.

154
00:39:19,448 --> 00:39:30,392
The English say not “τραύμα”, trauma… it’s very difficult.

155
00:39:35,920 --> 00:40:06,168
But see what happens. You don’t have only the vaccinations, the antibiotics, the cortisone, the neuroleptics etc.

156
00:40:17,008 --> 00:40:26,177
Because the organism has been undermined by all these drugs, chemical etc.

157
00:40:27,408 --> 00:40:40,904
it has become unable to face mental or emotional stresses.

158
00:40:43,568 --> 00:40:51,904
The moment that there is a mental/emotional stress there is a tremendous commotion in the organism.

159
00:40:56,216 --> 00:41:22,448
We say we Nat-m., when a Nat-m. has been rejected in a relationship, even one time, what if it happens 2-3 times,

160
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:42,728
creates such a deep trauma in the organism that after that you may have a kind of reaction on the long run

161
00:41:43,080 --> 00:42:01,696
that means after 2-10 years, when you have the manifestation of severe heart condition, severe neuromuscular disease, severe rheumatoid arthritis etc.

162
00:42:04,424 --> 00:42:22,160
I had a case about one year ago. A medical doctor called me and says I have cancer.

163
00:42:24,056 --> 00:42:40,496
I knew this man was quite healthy. You have cancer? Why? And then I take his case and I see Nat-m. is indicated.

164
00:42:41,800 --> 00:43:01,288
I said did you have a stress lately? He said yes I had. What was this stress? I was accused falsely.

165
00:43:25,928 --> 00:43:32,607
For what? For a subject I don’t want to discuss now.

166
00:43:33,368 --> 00:43:42,448
But he had no children, he was 50 year-old.

167
00:43:44,376 --> 00:43:59,936
Strong, a lot of energy, happiness and one shock like this where he felt his pride, his integrity,

168
00:44:04,329 --> 00:44:13,280
everything he believed for himself, being a righteous person, was shaken in its foundations.

169
00:44:15,732 --> 00:44:30,524
And this man he had in his mind to leave all his belongings, he was quite rich person, with houses etc.

170
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:36,836
to leave it to the child of the woman who accused him.

171
00:44:39,556 --> 00:44:57,987
He loved the child and the couple so much that he thought everything that belongs to me when I die will go their child.

172
00:44:59,387 --> 00:45:06,323
This woman comes and falsely accuses him for doing something wrong.

173
00:45:09,012 --> 00:45:31,332
He was speechless. He could not defend himself. 1,5 year later he comes and says they found by chance cancer in my lungs.

174
00:45:35,403 --> 00:46:20,192
I said ok… Take Nat-m. 50M. In the meantime there was collection in the pleura. I gave Nat-m. he started coughing.

175
00:46:23,912 --> 00:46:43,000
I gave Nat-m. and he said I feel… there is a Greek expression but I cannot translate it which means in perfect health, within 3 days.

176
00:46:45,840 --> 00:47:03,201
But the collection of the pleura was keeping on so I said they can draw the liquid from the lung mechanically to relieve you.

177
00:47:05,792 --> 00:47:18,744
He is a medical doctor, he works in the hospital together with all other colleagues of all specialties and they want to save him.

178
00:47:24,704 --> 00:47:33,775
He continues to feel well but there is a collection of liquid in the pleura.

179
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:56,024
So they suggest that they have a very simple operation in which they can close the opening in the pleura so it will stop discharging.

180
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:19,544
Do you understand perhaps? He asked me my opinion. I said you’re feeling well… yes, but the liquid is collection.

181
00:48:20,216 --> 00:48:36,640
Yes but you’re feeling well. So it’s up to you, you decide. So they persuaded him to close this with a powder like cement.

182
00:48:37,696 --> 00:48:52,008
Like wetness coming through the wall and then you plaster it not to see the wetness. It will keep on coming.

183
00:48:52,640 --> 00:49:03,848
The moment they closed this, within a few days he started coughing. Coughing.

184
00:49:07,584 --> 00:49:17,345
And once he started coughing he does not come anymore to see what we’ll do though it would be difficult for me now

185
00:49:18,384 --> 00:49:29,033
to counteract what they have done so he goes and takes chemotherapy.

186
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,144
And they persuaded him to take 1 week of chemotherapy and it will over.

187
00:49:35,641 --> 00:49:37,888
Then 2 weeks of chemotherapy and will be over.

188
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:54,088
Then 3,4 ,5 weeks and died… These are every day experience for us.

189
00:49:55,672 --> 00:50:11,688
What shall we suggest? This article was written out of these experiences.

190
00:50:14,376 --> 00:50:25,145
I suggest you should read the whole article and you will get some idea of what we are teaching here.

191
00:50:27,113 --> 00:50:44,256
Because if you come to me with all the trauma from the antibiotics, the vaccination plus the trauma of your life.

192
00:50:46,480 --> 00:51:05,544
One trauma after another in the life and then you say I feel tired all the time and I don’t feel very well,

193
00:51:07,664 --> 00:51:16,040
I have some anxiety and depression sometimes and then I have some pains in the joints…

194
00:51:19,296 --> 00:51:39,096
Underneath this organism who appears not to have yet a dramatic condition you realize as a homeopath that the defense mechanism as a total

195
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:54,624
is so much compromised that you may need 10 years of treating the case before the person can say I now feel well.

196
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:14,896
But listen now. The outside world, especially the scientific world and the skeptics and all these nonsense they ask where is the evidence?

197
00:52:15,176 --> 00:52:25,161
Show us the evidence. How shall we show you the evidence? Double-blind trials.

198
00:52:27,528 --> 00:52:49,864
What is double-blind trials? You have to give a remedy to the whole class for the same pathology and you have to show

199
00:52:50,280 --> 00:53:04,368
that 70% of them are cured by this remedy. You have 100 cases of asthma and which is the remedy for asthma?

200
00:53:06,072 --> 00:53:17,472
We don’t have but sometimes we think that a good remedy for asthma is Nat-s. or Kali-s. or Kali-c.

201
00:53:18,096 --> 00:53:26,784
If you give all these only 5% perhaps will be cured.

202
00:53:27,512 --> 00:53:36,792
How can you show that this is going to be a remedy for asthma? It’s not possible.

203
00:53:39,448 --> 00:53:49,233
So you see the problem we have in establishing this kind of treatment that we believe in.

204
00:53:53,184 --> 00:54:04,673
And what shall we do? We have to work. All of us. Not 1,2 or 10 persons.

205
00:54:06,344 --> 00:54:22,529
If you are convinced about the correctness of the treatment you go along and you do everything possible; you write on Facebook, you tweet,

206
00:54:24,176 --> 00:54:29,504
you send letters to your ministers of health.

207
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:58,616
Unless all of us are active what can we do? There is a English expression. “Let George do it”.

208
00:55:08,224 --> 00:55:20,952
When I was living in England they told me “let George do it”.

209
00:55:33,065 --> 00:55:43,538
I come back to the main idea of giving joy to the patient.

210
00:55:51,906 --> 00:56:08,882
Then there is the responsibility of the individual after you give him the possibility to have joy again, have happiness again,

211
00:56:09,658 --> 00:56:15,202
it is the responsibility of the individual to keep this condition.

212
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:34,418
Because if he exposes himself into stresses it is mathematically sure that he will have a relapse.

213
00:56:41,034 --> 00:56:53,026
I’ll give an example. You know Staph. it’s a remedy that we give to individuals, especially women, who are suppressed.

214
00:56:57,266 --> 00:57:01,345
That means they say yes to everything the husband says.

215
00:57:02,042 --> 00:57:07,666
Yes, yes… But they don’t believe inside there is a reaction.

216
00:57:10,122 --> 00:57:24,578
Then you give Staph. high potency to such an individual and suddenly there is a change in the mental/emotional structure of the individual

217
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:44,690
and after all she says why do you shout to me? So the husband says what did you say? I said why do you shout to me? He is surprised.

218
00:57:45,314 --> 00:57:56,314
She never used to talk to me that way and they start fighting.

219
00:57:58,906 --> 00:58:04,258
See now the sensitive point.

220
00:58:05,394 --> 00:58:16,258
A woman who wants to keep her relationship with her husband she has to find a way of compromising a little

221
00:58:17,754 --> 00:58:25,475
in order to keep the husband happy because the husband has been used to come and say where is my food.

222
00:58:30,002 --> 00:58:40,308
This is not good… and the woman… oh yes, I will do. The Greek woman.

223
00:58:40,652 --> 00:58:58,964
I don’t speak about the Danish or the Swiss woman. This doesn’t exist there. But Turkish, Indian woman maybe.

224
00:59:02,492 --> 00:59:09,804
I am talking to you about real cases. You give this remedy and then there is a fight.

225
00:59:10,492 --> 00:59:18,181
The woman demands respect. And the husband does not like it.

226
00:59:19,636 --> 00:59:31,660
He says what is this? If the woman continues in an aggressive way then end result will be divorce.

227
00:59:37,732 --> 00:59:48,316
The divorce has a price which is paid on the mental/emotional level.

228
00:59:49,852 --> 01:00:03,868
So unless the woman understands how she should handle the matter now that she feels stronger and more demanding,

229
01:00:04,589 --> 01:00:10,924
if she carries it to the extreme she will end up with a divorce.

230
01:00:11,812 --> 01:00:21,547
The divorce will have a depression and the woman will come to you. I separated with my husband.

231
01:00:23,732 --> 01:00:30,116
She doesn’t know that you gave the remedy and the remedy had the effect. Neither you tell her.

232
01:00:30,651 --> 01:00:37,395
You don’t tell her take the remedy, you divorce your husband! You have to be very careful!

233
01:00:39,684 --> 01:00:44,044
But this is a fact that we know that can happen.

234
01:00:44,916 --> 01:00:58,668
And if the woman comes back to you because of her arthritis, skin eruption, for different reasons

235
01:00:59,748 --> 01:01:13,996
and as you examine her you say you feel suppressed then you come down to the idea that Staph. is the remedy and you give it very high.

236
01:01:15,956 --> 01:01:21,699
She doesn’t know why you gave. She thinks you gave it for skin eruption.

237
01:01:22,932 --> 01:01:33,371
She doesn’t know that the remedy has given her the courage to demand her own and defend her integrity.

238
01:01:36,756 --> 01:01:48,924
And if the woman comes after the divorce you may have a more difficult case. Staph. in not any longer indicated.

239
01:01:50,548 --> 01:02:00,476
Then you have to find the new indicated remedy because of the stress she had through the divorce.

240
01:02:01,403 --> 01:02:11,220
And because of that stress if she comes to you it’s ok, if she goes to the psychologist or psychiatrist

241
01:02:12,636 --> 01:02:24,964
she will start getting antidepressants to overcome the period and then the drugs will take their toll on the condition

242
01:02:26,852 --> 01:02:39,500
and then later on she will develop something much more serious and this is how the disease is created.

243
01:02:39,979 --> 01:02:54,060
So we have  a system of medicine that compromises the immune system, then the immune system being compromised the person

244
01:02:54,507 --> 01:03:11,043
becomes easily irritated, angered, anxious then you take drugs to cover all this and then comes the depression etc.

245
01:03:15,067 --> 01:03:23,387
In the meantime life is so difficult that there is a possibility of a stress at any time.

246
01:03:24,195 --> 01:03:35,548
In a person who is already stressed even one word from another person can destroy him. Leave me alone.

247
01:03:36,948 --> 01:03:58,635
But what did he say? Leave him alone! Which is the secret that keep the husband or keep your balance?

248
01:04:02,291 --> 01:04:20,132
Why a person who hears this ‘leave me alone’ that you means you’re junk, jerk, what is affecting?

249
01:04:24,419 --> 01:04:43,339
You see the impact on the person will be directly analogous to your sense of pride.

250
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:56,379
The more the ego is inflated the more the impact is going to be.

251
01:05:02,572 --> 01:05:14,932
If you don’t want problems in your life you better be more humble and don’t think you are the best homeopath in the world!

252
01:05:15,827 --> 01:05:35,011
I am the best! Everyone knows our position and we understand…

253
01:05:39,604 --> 01:05:51,292
Especially being homeopaths a lot of people will come to you to say you saved my life, you are so wonderful,

254
01:05:51,995 --> 01:06:00,395
you are such a person, you are a divine person… If you take all these inside and you believe it, you had it.

255
01:06:01,428 --> 01:06:06,731
The next month you have forgotten half of the information.

256
01:06:07,131 --> 01:06:12,107
It’s very strange how it works. It works the opposite way.

257
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:28,372
The more you inflate believing what others are saying to you the more you are liable to become sick with the least stress.

258
01:06:31,036 --> 01:06:34,844
These are truths we don’t like. I don’t like it myself.

259
01:06:37,363 --> 01:06:51,364
If somebody comes and tells you are a lousy homeopath… I may be healthy! Because I believe I am good…

260
01:07:05,084 --> 01:07:10,108
As I always speak out of experience I will tell you the truth.

261
01:07:11,603 --> 01:07:22,356
I’ve been through all these and I have examined myself when some people where putting me down.

262
01:07:31,947 --> 01:07:52,843
I will give you a personal example. I was in a congress of the LIGA for medical doctors.

263
01:07:54,083 --> 01:08:04,931
I was in Germany in an international congress and I was in my first steps, just appearing internationally

264
01:08:05,771 --> 01:08:10,323
to see what they were saying, hear others speak etc.

265
01:08:14,148 --> 01:08:25,980
At the meantime they knew me because they asked me and I said take this remedy or the other, there were quite a few in the class 300 people.

266
01:08:34,756 --> 01:08:55,604
The congress starts and there was a French Demark , he was the president of the congress, he said those medical doctors

267
01:08:56,260 --> 01:09:17,019
who are members of the LIGA should come along and sit up to line 20, after 20 line associate members, so I was supposed to be an associate member.

268
01:09:18,531 --> 01:09:33,747
I was sitting at about line 18 so he comes and he says “Vithoulkas you go back!” in front of everybody.

269
01:09:38,147 --> 01:09:47,252
What could I do? I got up in front of everybody to go back to 21st line.

270
01:09:56,323 --> 01:10:11,755
This is true. They said you sit at 18th line and I should have decided by myself to go.

271
01:10:12,755 --> 01:10:16,115
I was speaking with someone sitting next to me all the time.

272
01:10:16,796 --> 01:10:24,603
I was busy explaining to him homeopathic matters but still...

273
01:10:38,404 --> 01:10:50,540
This particular was against me, this particular French doctor because he believed in specialties, mixing remedies and I was speaking about one remedy.

274
01:10:51,892 --> 01:11:04,692
He was attacking me every time. Instead of Demark that was his name I called him Dr.Remark.

275
01:11:08,696 --> 01:11:11,273
He always had to say something against me. It’s ok.

276
01:11:12,424 --> 01:11:17,032
But you can understand how I felt.

277
01:11:17,673 --> 01:11:32,281
If I had let myself been hurt, I was hurt, but not to the extent that I would develop cancer,

278
01:11:33,625 --> 01:11:44,425
but if I thought I am such a great homeopath… Anyhow things came that next year or 2 years later

279
01:11:45,784 --> 01:11:57,861
they decided in the LIGA to give me the status of a proper member.

280
01:11:59,077 --> 01:12:10,173
So I was an exception in the LIGA, I was allowed to be present and represent my country. But that’s another story.

281
01:12:11,708 --> 01:12:23,020
The moment he insulted me in front of so many other people I could have been very hurt.

282
01:12:24,068 --> 01:12:30,100
And I could have caused a lot of problems for myself at this moment.

283
01:12:35,317 --> 01:12:47,893
Is anybody who does not have ego? I don’t think there is any human being walking with 2 legs that has no ego,

284
01:12:49,581 --> 01:13:09,733
otherwise we would evaporate but let’s be within our senses. Once you realize what your limits are then there is no danger.

285
01:13:10,237 --> 01:13:29,764
Somebody may even insult you but you forgive. Forgiveness on the other hand is such a powerful tool for curing yourself.

286
01:13:42,045 --> 01:13:57,157
I’ll give you another example. I have seen the trauma of mothers who lost their children in the west.

287
01:13:59,117 --> 01:14:10,709
They may never overcome it. They come after 15 years the moment you mention this they break out crying,

288
01:14:11,588 --> 01:14:25,820
you see the organism is totally reduced because of this fact and then I have seen people from the East.

289
01:14:29,660 --> 01:14:40,508
They lose a child, they cry, shout 1 month, life continues.

290
01:14:41,437 --> 01:14:53,685
What is the difference between the reaction of our western population and the reaction of the eastern population?

291
01:14:55,381 --> 01:14:57,965
They’re basically healthier.

292
01:14:59,244 --> 01:15:08,109
They have not been vaccinated, they have not been harassed with a lot of drugs, they are more primitive of course,

293
01:15:10,037 --> 01:15:18,780
I accept it, we are more civilized we will kill with words, not bombs sometimes.

294
01:15:20,172 --> 01:15:40,252
But what is going to happen if the whole world becomes as sick as we are in the west? I am afraid very much.

295
01:15:51,316 --> 01:15:59,820
Sometimes I am afraid I may cause such stress in the people I am speaking.

296
01:16:00,164 --> 01:16:16,588
They may have problem. That is why I say to you always do not take it too seriously what I say.

297
01:16:16,884 --> 01:16:17,348
Thank you!
