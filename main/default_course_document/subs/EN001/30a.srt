1
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:22,427
We have a problem and the problem is this.

2
00:00:23,573 --> 00:00:31,042
I will show you a case, for instance, and I will make some questions to the patient.

3
00:00:31,563 --> 00:00:42,396
The questions I put have a purpose to discover what is the indicated remedy for that organism.

4
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:53,510
But the questions are guided by the fact that I know the Materia Medica.

5
00:00:53,615 --> 00:00:55,594
What is the Materia Medica?

6
00:00:55,698 --> 00:01:04,625
The Materia Medica is the information which has come from proving of remedies

7
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:12,958
and has been recorded in an encyclopedia which is called Materia Medica.

8
00:01:13,063 --> 00:01:25,458
That means my questioning will not be like a questioning of a conventional medical doctor

9
00:01:25,563 --> 00:01:36,469
who asks and wants to know about a specific pathology from which the patient is suffering.

10
00:01:36,573 --> 00:01:43,510
I would like to know, except of this pathology, the local pathology,

11
00:01:43,615 --> 00:01:57,750
I would like to know how his global organism responds and is trying to balance.

12
00:01:59,063 --> 00:02:15,073
The idea of examining a case is to find out how the organism has trying to bring balance

13
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:20,542
for a certain pathology which is suffering from.

14
00:02:20,646 --> 00:02:34,333
For instance, a man with a duodenal ulcer, he may have heart burn

15
00:02:34,438 --> 00:02:44,333
and pain 3-4 hours after eating. That is typical of duodenal ulcer pathology.

16
00:02:46,156 --> 00:02:54,219
But then this is not enough for us to give the remedy. Why? I will tell you why.

17
00:02:54,323 --> 00:03:06,458
Because one organism wants in order to balance a lot of water.

18
00:03:06,563 --> 00:03:14,844
So the person says I'm very thirsty and not only thirsty but I need water

19
00:03:14,948 --> 00:03:19,906
which is really cold, very cold.

20
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:28,052
The other says, I'm not thirsty at all. I don't need water.

21
00:03:28,156 --> 00:03:40,552
Actually if I drink water and especially if the water is cold, then I have a reaction

22
00:03:40,656 --> 00:03:43,406
and I have a nausea.

23
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:50,438
So we cannot give the same remedy to the one and to the other.

24
00:03:50,542 --> 00:03:58,760
We have to find which is the remedy which is indicated in this organism.

25
00:03:58,865 --> 00:04:12,563
In this way the modalities or the different symptoms which an organism develops

26
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:19,969
in order to counterbalance the problem are innumerable.

27
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:26,885
And out of these details of how the organism is reacting,

28
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:34,188
we try to find out the individual remedy which is indicated.

29
00:04:34,292 --> 00:04:41,281
And this is the big secret for Homeopathy.

30
00:04:41,385 --> 00:04:53,885
If you don't find the exact remedy which is needed for an organism, there is no effect.

31
00:04:55,719 --> 00:04:58,302
I'll give you an example.

32
00:04:58,406 --> 00:05:05,771
Many people thought how is that possible, you search for this remedy and you have to study,

33
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:11,583
you have to take properly a case, it takes a long time

34
00:05:11,688 --> 00:05:21,479
and I suspect that in a duodenal ulcer there are about 20 remedies

35
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:25,906
affecting primarily the duodenal ulcer.

36
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:39,104
Why not give all 20, which we call polypharmacy, and one of them

37
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:46,229
will be the correct between them and most probably will help the patient.

38
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:56,865
This was an understanding many, many years ago and there were in France

39
00:05:56,969 --> 00:06:04,938
and in Germany pharmacies they sold specialties for Homeopathy.

40
00:06:05,042 --> 00:06:16,313
Specialties for headaches, specialties for bronchitis, specialties for gastritis, for colitis,

41
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:29,427
for duodenal ulcer etc. That kind of Homeopathy is charlatanistic Homeopathy.

42
00:06:29,688 --> 00:06:36,531
If you are a charlatan, you can prescribe in this way.

43
00:06:36,635 --> 00:06:44,865
Otherwise if you want to help your patient, you have to sit down

44
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:55,542
and very methodically get all the information from his organism and then study properly

45
00:06:55,646 --> 00:06:58,844
in order to find what?

46
00:06:58,948 --> 00:07:11,958
To find the remedy that has the same kind of vibrational frequency actually.

47
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:16,542
Do you see the idea?

48
00:07:16,646 --> 00:07:32,427
Because the remedy does not contain one infinitesimally small amount of the remedy.

49
00:07:32,531 --> 00:07:34,771
So what are you giving?

50
00:07:36,438 --> 00:07:45,708
You transform the remedy to an energy remedy and then you give energy.

51
00:07:45,813 --> 00:07:52,844
But energy affecting energy, it can affect it through what?

52
00:07:54,583 --> 00:08:02,031
You cannot affect air by taking a stone and throw it to the air.

53
00:08:02,135 --> 00:08:13,490
You affect an air substance by another air substance and then you can mix them

54
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:17,667
and then there is effect.

55
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:27,729
Liquid with liquid. Then you can mix them. Liquid with air you cannot.

56
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:36,844
Here we have energy and when we mix it with the energy of the organism...

57
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:48,917
What is the idea of affecting the energy, affecting that energy?

58
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:55,167
I'll give you another example.

59
00:08:56,729 --> 00:09:02,635
How many of you play the guitar?

60
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:22,323
If you strike a 'La' note and you have next to it a chord which is in this frequency,

61
00:09:22,427 --> 00:09:30,698
the other chord without touching it starts vibrating. If it is 'La', it's the same frequency.

62
00:09:30,802 --> 00:09:35,344
So this is the idea, the same frequency.

63
00:09:35,448 --> 00:09:50,698
You find the frequency of the organism by doing all this research and actually excavate,

64
00:09:50,802 --> 00:09:57,469
bringing to the front symptomatology of the patient.

65
00:09:57,573 --> 00:10:03,771
But what is the difference? It's not only that we have to know

66
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:15,656
the physical symptomatology of the patient. Therefore a human being is not only material body.

67
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:31,010
We talk and when we talk we get ideas from another plane and we get also emotions.

68
00:10:31,115 --> 00:10:44,281
So we are emotions, we are ideas, we are thinking and also we have physical bodies.

69
00:10:44,385 --> 00:10:59,313
Each case, every pathology case can affect, may affect, not necessarily will affect

70
00:10:59,417 --> 00:11:05,812
but can affect the mental and emotional state of the human being.

71
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:14,948
So if a pathology has affected the feelings or the way of thinking of a human being,

72
00:11:15,052 --> 00:11:21,198
then we have to know the changes, how it has affected.

73
00:11:21,302 --> 00:11:25,708
You know how duodenal ulcer is produced?

74
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:44,625
Duodenal ulcer is produced when anger is not expressed in time and is held inside

75
00:11:44,729 --> 00:11:58,167
and all the anger which is held inside produces acids which burn the mucus membranes

76
00:11:58,271 --> 00:12:05,208
usually of the duodenal or the stomach, in which case you will have gastritis,

77
00:12:05,313 --> 00:12:13,438
or the duodenal, in which case you will have duodenal ulcer or affects the colon,

78
00:12:13,542 --> 00:12:16,667
in which case you will have colitis.

79
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:30,625
Therefore holding the anger creates a situation in the physical body

80
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:39,229
and the two are affecting each other and that is why they have found out

81
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:53,125
and it is very well known what they call the psychosomatic medicine.

82
00:12:53,646 --> 00:13:05,000
The only psychosomatic medicine which exists is Homeopathy because this is the medicine

83
00:13:05,104 --> 00:13:12,292
that takes into consideration the psychology and the physical.

84
00:13:12,396 --> 00:13:19,333
And there are laws according to which you are proceeding.

85
00:13:19,438 --> 00:13:27,146
You are not treating...for your depression I will give you an anti-depressant

86
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,104
and what happens after that?

87
00:13:30,885 --> 00:13:37,729
Because you are anxious, I will give you an anxiolytic remedy.

88
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:46,844
It is like trying to target in one point in the organism,

89
00:13:48,719 --> 00:14:02,896
where a depressed person is a person that does not produce enzymes, opiates

90
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,698
which give a feeling of well-being.

91
00:14:10,552 --> 00:14:13,854
There is a series of facts.

92
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:24,521
Somebody lost his job, he has a fight with the director, they shout

93
00:14:25,677 --> 00:14:32,854
and then he says I go from the company, I don't want to be in your company anymore,

94
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:42,073
you are this and that and he leaves.

95
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:55,375
Such a person who has spoken out all his anger, he has no danger in affecting his body.

96
00:14:55,896 --> 00:15:03,146
He spoke out, he said whatever he had to say and he is relieved.

97
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:14,938
Another person goes to the person who has accused him unjustly, he tries to tell

98
00:15:15,042 --> 00:15:22,500
that I'm not responsible for this mistake, no you are responsible, he cannot speak,

99
00:15:22,604 --> 00:15:30,740
the anger is increasing more and more and he is discharged from that company.

100
00:15:30,844 --> 00:15:39,073
That person within 3-4 days he will start having pains in the stomach because of the anger.

101
00:15:39,177 --> 00:15:55,656
Because of the anger the pathologist to whom he goes,

102
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,594
he does not take into consideration what happened, the suppressed anger.

103
00:16:00,698 --> 00:16:08,240
What he knows is that the acids in the stomach are increasing.

104
00:16:08,344 --> 00:16:14,490
Therefore I will give you an anti-acid remedy.

105
00:16:14,594 --> 00:16:26,990
Take an anti-acid remedy, you take it every day and then what happens?

106
00:16:27,094 --> 00:16:32,719
You do not allow the physical reaction of the organism, you suppress it,

107
00:16:32,823 --> 00:16:42,458
you do not allow it to bring out the acid, to bring out the poison of the organism.

108
00:16:42,563 --> 00:16:53,396
So by not allowing there to come out the anger of the stomach, then the anger

109
00:16:53,500 --> 00:17:03,542
which was inside and it was expressing the anger through the acid in the stomach

110
00:17:03,646 --> 00:17:12,312
cannot express it anymore and the person becomes depressed.

111
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:17,656
So depression now is much more a serious condition

112
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,021
than the suppressed anger that was before.

113
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:33,219
Then depression and depression and then one day the person commits suicide.

114
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:39,208
You see how things are happening.

115
00:17:39,729 --> 00:17:43,979
I describe to you very grossly what happens.

116
00:17:47,594 --> 00:17:59,740
Actually targeting your medicine in one part of your body does not solve the problem.

117
00:18:01,031 --> 00:18:13,438
If I give you a remedy which can stop the acid coming out is not a good idea

118
00:18:13,542 --> 00:18:20,979
because it may be suppressing and then all the different reactions will take place

119
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:27,094
within the organism and a more deep problem will manifest.

120
00:18:28,646 --> 00:18:41,448
If I have a case and she tells me I have a problem, my main problem is with menses.

121
00:18:41,552 --> 00:18:48,156
I have a lot of pain before menses, during menses, a lot of bleeding...

122
00:18:50,073 --> 00:18:52,677
Why she has this problem?

123
00:18:53,719 --> 00:19:01,792
Maybe we don't know, maybe we cannot find the real reason but we have to investigate why.

124
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:13,667
Even if we can't find, then we can go the ancestry. The mother had the same syndrome?

125
00:19:13,771 --> 00:19:19,146
Then we can explain by genetic predisposition.

126
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:30,344
Then we cannot find because these are unknown but we don't give a remedy or we don't

127
00:19:30,448 --> 00:19:42,063
have a remedy for stopping the excessed blood or stopping the pains in the abdomen.

128
00:19:43,896 --> 00:19:52,312
Usually the women take spasmolytics in order to counteract the pains.

129
00:19:53,365 --> 00:20:06,010
So while the problem is local, we start investigating what kind of fears you may have,

130
00:20:06,115 --> 00:20:13,052
what about anxieties, what about fears, depressions,

131
00:20:13,156 --> 00:20:18,094
mental-emotional structure of this organism?

132
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:29,969
Together with some other areas in which apart from the premenstrual syndrome,

133
00:20:30,073 --> 00:20:34,250
she also has a chronic constipation.

134
00:20:35,021 --> 00:20:44,823
So all this, the mental-emotional symptomatology, the menstrual symptomatology

135
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:57,073
and the constipation symptomatology are studied together in order to find the remedy

136
00:20:57,177 --> 00:21:06,802
that synchronizes with such a global symptomatology.

137
00:21:14,792 --> 00:21:19,604
I made this introduction for those who do not know that

138
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:34,635
when you will see a case taking you will say why George is asking irrelevant questions.

139
00:21:34,896 --> 00:21:43,479
She came for headaches and he is asking whether you have diarrhea or constipation

140
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:52,510
and whether your menses are normal or not normal. But here I came for my headaches.

141
00:21:52,615 --> 00:22:02,844
The problem that has been so far with Homeopathy is that people

142
00:22:02,948 --> 00:22:12,469
who practice Homeopathy did not understand the basic truths of Homeopathy,

143
00:22:12,573 --> 00:22:21,073
that we have laws according to which we prescribe and then they thought

144
00:22:21,177 --> 00:22:28,354
we prescribe symptomatically, according to the symptoms.

145
00:22:28,458 --> 00:22:37,260
Somebody will relate a few symptoms and the homeopath will write a prescription.

146
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:49,531
I have pains in my abdomen before menses, OK I'll give you 5 remedies, take 10 remedies

147
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:53,719
that they have pains before menses.

148
00:22:53,823 --> 00:23:10,104
But that is wrong and not only do not cure but it can suppress to a certain extend this pain

149
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:21,531
which is going to be transformed now into a deeper problem of pathology

150
00:23:21,635 --> 00:23:26,000
and usually on the mental-emotional level.

151
00:23:27,813 --> 00:23:39,958
That is how we have pushed diseases from physical body to the mental-emotional sphere

152
00:23:40,063 --> 00:23:45,958
and we have made a society today which is a crazy society.

153
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:52,458
Do you think that we are sane?

154
00:23:54,469 --> 00:24:06,177
We are insane but because everyone is insane we admit that everybody is OK.

155
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:15,563
But what are these reactions that we are having each one?

156
00:24:16,073 --> 00:24:23,448
What happens in America? One child gets the gun of his father, he goes to school

157
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:30,875
and kills 1,2,3,4,5 of his class mates.

158
00:24:31,365 --> 00:24:41,490
Another one takes a gun and kills his colleagues, these are extremes

159
00:24:41,594 --> 00:24:50,448
but are these reactions of a society which is sane?

160
00:24:54,531 --> 00:25:03,281
Maybe you say you take some extreme examples. It's not a few extreme examples.

161
00:25:04,896 --> 00:25:19,708
You have every day all fights which happen within a family

162
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:28,188
and you will see in the family they tear to pieces each other

163
00:25:32,042 --> 00:25:42,188
and you will see hysterical reactions, you will see crazy reactions in the family.

164
00:25:43,521 --> 00:25:50,427
The children don't know anymore what is normal and what is not normal.

165
00:25:50,531 --> 00:25:55,094
Parents don't know anymore what is normal.

166
00:25:55,198 --> 00:26:05,344
A child of 12 years old to have sex and the mother and father think that it's normal.

167
00:26:05,448 --> 00:26:07,281
It's not normal.

168
00:26:12,479 --> 00:26:23,323
The moment that a child 12,13,14,15,16,17 starts having sex from that moment

169
00:26:23,427 --> 00:26:30,865
onwards starts the craziness, the child will behave in a crazy way.

170
00:26:30,969 --> 00:26:38,688
Because she will get hurt, she will get misused, she will develop hatred,

171
00:26:38,792 --> 00:26:49,365
she will become a feminist, she will have a lot of mental-emotional problems after that.

172
00:26:49,469 --> 00:26:54,490
And then she goes to the society and she accuses the society

173
00:27:00,479 --> 00:27:06,563
since everyone in the society is more or less in the same boat.

174
00:27:08,385 --> 00:27:20,281
It is understood and the society says it is acceptable.

175
00:27:20,792 --> 00:27:35,729
Anything is acceptable and you see all the deviations and the craziness which is going on.

176
00:27:37,292 --> 00:27:39,635
We live in that society.

177
00:27:43,281 --> 00:27:47,094
How this society has come about?

178
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:59,708
You know the responsibility of wrong medicine, applying wrong medicines.

179
00:28:00,219 --> 00:28:10,292
That part is quite big, I would say 60% is responsible for such a society.

180
00:28:10,396 --> 00:28:16,646
The vaccinations, the conventional medicine, the antibiotics and all that.

181
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:27,219
That is why the Western societies, Europe, America, Canada are in that state.

182
00:28:27,323 --> 00:28:43,896
Not developing countries like South America which is much more down to earth people.

183
00:28:47,552 --> 00:29:02,656
And also the Asians. They also have some samples but it's very limited.

184
00:29:03,427 --> 00:29:10,885
In our society because we are all vaccinated, we have all taken antibiotics,

185
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:24,292
we all have this miasm, we will be talking about the miasm, this miasm of cultural deviation.
