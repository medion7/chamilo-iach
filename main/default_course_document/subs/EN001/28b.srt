1
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,620
Anybody knows the theory concerning high potencies?

2
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:12,870
A group of us in Greece with small clusters, do you know that theory?

3
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,370
-No.

4
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:32,000
-Who knows? You have read our paper?
-...clusters of molecules diluted in water.

5
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,610
-This is a hypothesis we brought about.

6
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:15,600
-...200 K or C, it is the same, the difference is in preparation 

7
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:23,240
but it is 200 times diluted and succused both. 

8
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,390
There is a kind of misinformation which goes on that the C potencies, 

9
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:39,390
the Hahnemannian potencies are stronger than the Korsakov.

10
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,740
This is not true. 

11
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:50,640
If you prepare by taking one drop from the first solution 

12
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:57,680
and you put this drop to a second bottle with 100 and you dilute and then you succuss, 

13
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:03,240
this is the Hahnemannian method or the C.

14
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:13,070
If you empty the bottle and you refill it, the same bottle with 100 drops, 

15
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:26,070
what is left on the walls of the bottle is one part and you so you have again 1 part in 99

16
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,310
and you succuss it. 

17
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:35,820
In both cases you have 1 part in 99 and you succuss it and again 1 part in 99 

18
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:45,920
and you succuss it, so the effect of both methods should be the same if they are well succussed.

19
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,660
There is no difference.

20
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:58,310
The difference is that preparing by this method you need 200 bottles 

21
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:13,910
and you need a lot more solution, whatever you prepare.

22
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:20,390
It maybe a more expensive method. The problem is, 

23
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:33,310
if they say this is 1000 times Hahnemannian way, have they done it really? 

24
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:45,150
Because it means 1000 times somebody takes the bottle, takes one drop, goes to another bottle,

25
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,730
refills, put the drop and succuss it.

26
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:54,580
Take one drop again. So it's not automatic.

27
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,830
Where with the other method, emptying and refilling, is automatic.

28
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:08,480
So I have a problem, when they say this is 10.000. have they done it 10.000?

29
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:13,560
It really is 10.000 times the Hahnemannian way? 

30
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:18,410
I have a problem there to believe.

31
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:36,900
In order to use the same bottle, you have to go through very high temperature to spoil 

32
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
and continue etc. It's a big process which becomes much more expensive.

33
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:50,080
But some pharmaceutical companies in order to compensate for that, 

34
00:05:50,180 --> 00:06:01,170
they say the Hahnemannian potency, let us the 12 potency is equal to 200 Korsakov.

35
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,670
In Canada you don't say such words.

36
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:21,900
Where the small clusters are formed with this process, 

37
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:31,960
there are clusters of molecules of the original substance in the water and around them 

38
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:41,740
they are molecules of water which they go and envelop these clusters.

39
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:48,210
As you go higher and higher, what it remains are the clathrates, 

40
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:58,460
it remains a kind of the shape of the cell of the original clusters.

41
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:10,810
These clusters, as they form in physics, they tend to go and stick to the walls of the bottle. 

42
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:18,700
That's why the Korsakov method where it takes its original substance from the walls

43
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:25,200
- because if you empty the bottle and you turn it back what is left is, 

44
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:35,700
what is stuck on the walls- so these are the solutions which contain most of the clusters.

45
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:42,960
So if you take from the middle, you may not be getting some clusters sometimes 

46
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:47,460
where on the walls definitely there are clusters.

47
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:56,810
So the Korsakov method is more reliable than the Hahnemannian method.

48
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:05,380
And as you know I have great problems many times 

49
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,130
because the remedy was not really potentized.

50
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:13,310
They would say it's 1M and it was nothing.

51
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:19,470
That's why I had proposed to different pharmaceutical companies 

52
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:26,880
that they would prepare medicines, if I had given them instructions how to do it, 

53
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:33,950
in a way that it would be with an automatic machine. 

54
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:40,120
A machine that would duplicate an original way of preparing the medicine, 

55
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:54,370
that was hitting, that is how it was prepared. And that is how Homeopathy started.

56
00:08:54,470 --> 00:09:01,380
Different companies they had different ways, like put and vibrate, inject water 

57
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,050
and different other ideas came in.

58
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:10,790
I said forget all that, I want the original way, I want an automatic electronic machine

59
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:15,290
which will not interfere at all, the human being will not interfere.

60
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:21,790
You can switch and say, I want these potencies to be selected 

61
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:29,830
and the machine automatically will refill, will shake and keep at the same time, 

62
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:38,900
keep aside No 12 potency, No 30 potency and work automatically day and night.

63
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:45,320
So therefore I'm sure when I give 1M potency that it is 1M potency, 

64
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:51,640
it's not 12 or 20 instead of 200.

65
00:09:52,390 --> 00:10:05,790
There were several pharmaceutical companies that were interested and when they heard that,

66
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:12,710
they found it very expensive, how many remedies would sell and finally they were not interested.

67
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:21,220
There was one firm in Italy that was doing dialysis machines for the kidneys 

68
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,710
and they got interested. They said we want to go to Homeopathy, what do you want?

69
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:32,460
I want a team of such people, mechanical engineers etc. and I will tell them exactly

70
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,790
what is the machine that I want and I imagine. 

71
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:46,400
I want the original and I gave them the strength with which you hit and the fastness.

72
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:53,460
The original is different, I can not imagine it's doing like that, like the machines they have.

73
00:10:53,560 --> 00:11:02,700
It needs some time and it has to come horizontally and then hit and hit. 

74
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:11,630
It's different because these clathrates, these clusters they form and they are allowed to settle.

75
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:16,810
Otherwise it becomes like a madness within the water.

76
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:30,210
But anyhow my idea of reproducing the original medicine was from the simple logic

77
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:37,630
that the original medicines were produced by a hand, brought about, manifested in Homeopathy.

78
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:44,730
So this is the way the medicines should continue to be done.

79
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:57,870
This company, the Italian company, is producing at this moment these kind of potencies.

80
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:01,230
Korsakov method.

81
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:06,390
-What is the name of the company?
-The name of the company is SIFFRA.

82
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:18,300
And now when I want to give a 10M or 50M potency, I know it is a 50M potency 

83
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:25,800
and if it does not work, I know it is my fault and not the fact 

84
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,140
that there is no medicine in that.

85
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:36,550
That is another thing I brought into Homeopathy in order to secure the idea, 

86
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:42,890
because we depend entirely on the integrity of the pharmacy.

87
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:47,050
You hear the mandragora case, what she said.

88
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:50,300
Because she is sensitive she understands, she took medicine 

89
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,220
and there was nothing in the medicine.

90
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:04,630
Bill Gray is here and maybe he will remember an incident in Berkley.

91
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:11,870
Baker one of the naturopathic doctors was sitting there and one time I saw him collapsing.

92
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:12,870
I said what is happening? 

93
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:19,620
He was perspiring, he said, I have diarrhea, vomiting, I don't feel well. 

94
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:31,370
We took him upstairs in one room in the hotel and what was the remedy that we prescribed?

95
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:36,160
I prescribed Carbo Vegetabilis for him. I left him upstairs, 

96
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:42,960
I went down to continue the lecture and after 1 hour I went upstairs to see how he was.

97
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:59,560
After 1 hour, he was the same. He says, I think I'm not Carbo Vegetabilis. 

98
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,950
I think I need Arsenicum. Why? 

99
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:11,960
Because I have some fear, fear of dying, he was totally exhausted.

100
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:18,900
I had given him one dose of Carbo Vegetabilis 1M.

101
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:26,460
But for me when I give a remedy, I know why I give the remedy and when I see the symptoms,

102
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,960
the symptoms are Carbo Vegetabilis. I say, something is wrong with the medicine, 

103
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,960
the medicine was not correct.

104
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:37,210
I go down, I say, has anybody Carbo Vegetabilis 200? 

105
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:50,040
Yes, one student had, I go upstairs and I give 200. In less than one minute, the man says,

106
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,140
I feel better.

107
00:14:53,890 --> 00:15:00,790
In 1 hour he was travelling back with his car to his place where he was travelling in 

108
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:03,730
and out to come to this seminar.

109
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:11,230
The 1M what it contained? Nothing, it was pure water. 

110
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:19,300
There was another case, Bill may still remember.

111
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:34,210
Phosphorus 50M. A month later comes the report by Nancy Herring.  

112
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:40,460
It says the report it's a little bit better, nothing really...

113
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:47,060
I ask the class, what is wrong? Medicine is wrong. 

114
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:59,960
I say this medicine, Phosphorus 50M has acted as if it was one dose of 12 to my understanding.

115
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:11,310
I said, the medicine is wrong give her a dose of 200 from another pharmacy, beautiful reaction.

116
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:20,380
A case of Paris Quadrifolia in London where I was teaching, 

117
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,230
these are public cases I'm talking about. 

118
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:29,380
I come 3 months later, I teach again and the case is presented, nothing.

119
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,130
The same. I go up to the class, I say the medicine is wrong.

120
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:39,130
We try to find another medicine? I said, no go to 3 other pharmacies, 

121
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:45,880
find again Paris Quadrifolia 30 from 3 other pharmacies, to be sure and give it to her.

122
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,980
3 months later, she was cured. 

123
00:16:49,980 --> 00:17:01,130
All this and a lot of other experiences in Athens where a remedy was open and close. 

124
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:05,630
A pharmacy gets a bottle and from this bottle gives to different patients.

125
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:12,710
There is a time where the bottle is spoiled, either because of some perfumes or whatever

126
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:21,060
and he gives a dose from that bottle and the remedy does not work.

127
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:28,210
Then the doctor, when the patient comes, the doctor thinks - 

128
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:33,220
especially if he isn't very sure about the remedy - the remedy is wrong, 

129
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,970
I give another remedy and another remedy and another remedy.

130
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:45,970
I remember another case in Berkley. I took a case, 150 remedies the person had taken.

131
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:53,560
150 remedies in 7 years!

132
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:05,220
I said, what shall I do? I read, I read, I read the remedies and I take the case 

133
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,710
and I say the remedy I see is very clear, it's not here.

134
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:17,970
He gave 150 remedies and within 150 possibilities did not strike the right remedy,

135
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:23,710
that is unbelievable; the doctor was there and I did not know what to say, 

136
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:26,730
it was a clear case of Gelsemium.

137
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,220
I say, this is a clear case of Gelsemium. 

138
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:37,230
Ah, he says Gelsemium was the first remedy I gave. 7 years ago.

139
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:43,400
He had not written it because he wrote the last remedies. 

140
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:51,050
He said that was the first remedy, from which pharmacy? From that pharmacy.

141
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:59,230
Give Gelsemium from 3 other pharmacies, action.

142
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:08,130
All these led me to believe that there is something wrong with the pharmacies,

143
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:12,560
we have to have reliable medicines.

144
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:20,730
When I say in this case that I'm not sure about the remedy, I say Psorinum and it does not work,

145
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:26,830
he will go immediately to Silica but if the remedy is not reliable, what happens?

146
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:34,570
Because I am not sure. In case of Lachesis I'm sure, in case of Sulphur I'm sure, 

147
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:37,320
in this case I'm not sure. 

148
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:44,240
So immediately I will jump to the next remedy and if the remedy is not right I lose the whole thing.

149
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:50,990
You understand how much important is for us to have reliability in the medicine?

150
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:56,250
And when we say 200 it is 200 and when we say 1M it is 1M.

151
00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:03,990
That's why I asked them and they are preparing in this way, duplicating the hand made potencies,

152
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:08,740
in an electronic way without interfering at all by hand.

153
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:18,600
You know how much difficult it is for a person to sit down and measure 200 times.

154
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:25,170
There was that we ordered 200 and it was only 20 times, why?

155
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:33,400
Because between 20 and 180 that they were missing, the man was going to see his child

156
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,500
who was sick, that was in Italy.

157
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:44,660
The man who was in charge, after interrogation, after pushing we found out 

158
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:52,660
that he had left and the time he was supposed to make the 200, he was in his house, 

159
00:20:52,760 --> 00:21:01,970
looking after his child who was sick. But this is what happens if you rely on the human factor.

160
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:13,430
That is why now I say 200, 1M and 10M. Maybe one of the three will be.

161
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:22,180
I have more chances to be correct because I saw you being aggravated a little bit.

162
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,420
But unfortunately this is my experience.

163
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:39,670
In one day morning, noon and night. In one day all 3 different, yes.

164
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:45,570
-Do you, in your experience, homeopathic remedies sensitive to  magnetic fields, 

165
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:52,010
strong fields?
-No. There are not. 

166
00:21:53,260 --> 00:22:03,160
They are sensitive to heat and this is for sure.

167
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:13,010
If you expose them to the sun, to heat more than 40-50 degrees, then you may have a problem.

168
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:27,660
-I read a book from a doctor [name of the doctor] PhD and he reported experiences with dilutions.

169
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:33,660
And he said it seems to medication sinusoidal effect, different dilutions meaning 

170
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,910
that some dilutions will product a positive effect and the next dilution 

171
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:46,170
will product some opposite or no effect at all, control of dilution, kind of.

172
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:51,010
-This is the work of Benveniste. 

173
00:22:51,760 --> 00:23:01,410
-He was reporting many works on dilutions, control delusions and he was reporting 

174
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:09,750
that whatever they tried, they are the sinusoidal effect with some dilution ...

175
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:19,660
-Maybe it was before Benveniste. Benveniste did the experiment. You know it?

176
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:25,920
This experiment had some problems and we back fire for Homeopathy a lot 

177
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:33,990
and he brought out the idea of one dilution being active, the next dilution not active.

178
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:37,490
I don't accept that, no.

179
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:43,740
-Can you describe what you are looking for at this stage of the day that is coming?

180
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:49,600
Of the different potencies? Is it possible to describe the changes that you' re looking for?

181
00:23:50,850 --> 00:24:01,330
-In that particular case? Why I gave three potencies?

182
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:07,170
-And what specifically you're looking for during the course of the day?

183
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:17,160
-I'm not looking specifically for anything. I'm trying to create a reaction from the remedy.

184
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:26,990
So if I was very sure that a remedy was really potentized 10.000 times

185
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:32,000
I would say take one dose of Psorinum 10.000.

186
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:38,000
But as I'm not sure about that, I give three possibilities, I give one 200, 

187
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:45,750
there is a possibility that there is a potentized remedy 1M and 10M another possibility.

188
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:51,000
If all three of them are potentized, 

189
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:57,440
then most probably we may have a bigger reaction than normal.

190
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:05,830
Some people claim like Marjory Blackie from England, she used to give that kind of schema,

191
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:10,830
she used to give three potencies and she claimed 

192
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:22,330
that in this way minimized the reaction of the patient, the aggravation. 

193
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:25,060
I'm not sure about that.

194
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:39,910
-I just wanted to ask if you had any experience with the LM potencies, 

195
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:42,910
whether you recommend them at all?

196
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:46,410
-I do not have much experience with LM potencies. 

197
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:51,910
I would recommend them sometimes when there are hyper sensitive people 

198
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:59,410
and I want really to give a very low potency and bring about very little aggravation, 

199
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:06,160
I resort to LM. I have done it very few times.

200
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:19,730
One time I've done it, my experience was in Italy with a child with epidermolysis bullosa.

201
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:28,630
For those who know a little bit of dermatology, they know this is a fatal disease in children,

202
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:36,880
where the skin is not formed, the absorption of different minerals are not done 

203
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:41,130
and there is no skin actually, the moment they touch the skin it opens up, 

204
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:47,370
it makes a wound and then the child is bandaged with wounds all over 

205
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:53,730
and they live 3,4,5 years at the most 7 years and they die.

206
00:26:53,970 --> 00:27:04,210
That child was 1 1/2 year old, he was so sensitive, he was Phosphorus, his remedy was Phosphorus

207
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:11,470
and I said give him 3 doses of Phosphorus LM.

208
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:17,300
With the first potency they gave, there was a tremendous reaction 

209
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:22,880
and the whole chest became a wound, opened. 

210
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:30,310
It was definitely very bad aggravation, with 1 dose of LM.

211
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:38,470
And after that there was an amelioration and then there was a repetition, 

212
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:42,390
again aggravation and amelioration. 

213
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:48,390
This is the experience I have with LM potencies and in some other cases 

214
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:53,970
where it has been suggested in over sensitive, I have not seen that kind of reaction,

215
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,070
I'm relating to you.

216
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:05,300
-This kid you saw in Italy was cured?

217
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:21,050
-The boy is still alive, he is 5 years old, he is still alive, his skin is not perfect 

218
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:36,630
but he is much, much better and I believe that if they continue treatment, he will be saved.

219
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:39,630
-And he is still Phosphorus.

220
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:45,730
-Eventually he went to Calcarea carbonica. After 2 years I think, I prescribe Cal. carb.

221
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:51,140
-The case that we saw, which you prescribed Psorinum, 

222
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:57,640
is there any concern giving a 10M with the skin problems coming back very strongly?

223
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,630
-I didn't follow?

224
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:04,880
-Are you concerned about giving a 10M and having a very severe skin aggravation

225
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,640
skin symptoms coming back very strongly?

226
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:21,480
-No, no. I wish they come back and they come strong. I have no problem with her.

227
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:36,140
-If the higher potencies seem to be  less likely to be what they say on a vial

228
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,160
why they give 3 doses of 200 from 3 different pharmacies?

229
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:48,800
-Because if the bottle is spoiled and you give 3 doses, it doesn't matter, still is spoiled.

230
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,380
-But from 3 different bottles.

231
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,390
-From 3 different pharmacies? 

232
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:57,890
That's another idea, which I've done several times 

233
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:07,500
but it's more difficult for the person to go searching for 3 different pharmacies perhaps.

234
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:21,940
-Do you think we should give 3 doses of every medication that we give for everyone?

235
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:29,340
-If there is no problem with the patient, there is no problem with the aggravation, 

236
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:37,800
yes you can do it, if you are not afraid of deep pathology and it's not an old person 

237
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:43,900
and it's not the last stages of a disease, yes you can do that.

238
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:54,400
-What is your view of these pieces of equipment which prepare remedies?

239
00:30:55,190 --> 00:31:05,810
-Like radioinics machines? I'm sorry but I do not agree with that. I don't agree why?

240
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:13,560
Because I have checked out, I have certain people who had the machine 

241
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:19,300
and tried to persuade me this is perfect. I said, I don't believe it. 

242
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:25,630
This person called me to take his case and he was quite seriously sick, 

243
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:33,630
so I took his case and I said, OK now prepare the remedy with your machine 

244
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:46,640
and take it and we will see after a week or 10 days we will see what happened. He says ahh...

245
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:52,380
I said, no if you believe it and you tried for 3/4 of an hour to persuade me 

246
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,890
that this is a good machine, you better try it on yourself. 

247
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:03,510
I'll tell you the remedy, you prepare it, you take it and see what happens.

248
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:17,480
You will do it this way and he had to do it and he came after a week, I'm the same.

249
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:23,070
Well you are the same but we still have to wait another week to be sure.

250
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:34,230
I said, you are a scientist, he was a physist and you want to know if it works, 

251
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:39,410
you have  been trying to persuade me that there are magnetic fields and blah, blah and all this.

252
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:45,730
Now you better test it on yourself and I made him suffer, of course.

253
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,980
And there were other experiments which I did. 

254
00:32:54,080 --> 00:33:04,600
If somebody claims that this it, I said OK, it is honest that we do a real test. 

255
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:10,300
If you believe in your machine, we'll make a real test and I'll tell you what kind of test

256
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:16,490
and if you pass the test, I'll be the first one to say yes the machine is good.

257
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:27,380
The pendulum.... but you are moving your hand. 

258
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:32,570
No, no I'm not moving my hand it's moving by itself. 

259
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:38,880
You see now it's moving the other direction.

260
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:46,300
Somebody else comes in the seminar, he had an antenna from his car.

261
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:53,550
So with his antenna, he would search the remedy and he would go to the people and say,

262
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:56,300
George said this remedy, it's wrong. 

263
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:02,630
My antenna says this remedy and people come and say, what is this?

264
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:11,460
I said, come here find your remedy. What is the remedy? Veratrum.

265
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,710
He goes to another one, what remedy he told you? Veratrum.

266
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:20,300
He goes to a child, I have given a child Pulsatilla, he says Veratrum.

267
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:29,740
I had to call him, I said come, can you do it for me so I can see how you do it?

268
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:38,050
He went through the antenna, he checked all the meridians with the antenna 

269
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:42,890
and then he goes over the thing, he says Veratrum.

270
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:57,880
The man went into an asylum eventually but it was very interesting.

271
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:06,130
Either he, himself had taken Veratrum or he needed Veratrum himself 

272
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:13,310
and he would give everybody Veratrum and everybody would say, he is totally crazy.

273
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:22,920
Then I found out that really he went into a clinic, into mental clinic.

274
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,700
This is antenna Homeopathy.

275
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:38,350
-It is speculation.
-It was speculation yes. Why? 

276
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:44,650
I might pick one remedy, give it to you and sometimes it may still work 

277
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:51,830
but is this a science, what is this? I don't know what it is?

278
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:56,840
And that's why Homeopathy has such a bad name. 

279
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:07,310
I had a case with this pendulum where it had been to a medical student in South Africa 

280
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:18,810
at least 25-30 remedies over a period of years every day 50M, CM potencies, 

281
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:25,810
every day for 3 months and again another remedy for 2 months and another remedy 

282
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:30,910
for 1 month...with this pendulum. 

283
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:35,820
When he came to me there was such confusion in his case, 

284
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:41,810
it was impossible to find anything; I said, I can't help you, I can't see any remedy. 

285
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:48,090
You have symptoms from all the remedies. The boy committed suicide. 

286
