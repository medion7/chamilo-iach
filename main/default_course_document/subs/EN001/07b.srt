1
00:00:22,292 --> 00:00:30,417
Who has a good idea about the
qualities of a healthy mind?

2
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:38,531
Who got the Agaricus?

3
00:00:55,333 --> 00:01:02,510
Later on you will see the percentage.
 Who got the Aconite?

4
00:01:16,063 --> 00:01:23,000
More or less the same percentage
 with the Italian group.

5
00:01:27,177 --> 00:01:36,000
So, I would like to hear your opinion
concerning the qualities of a healthy mind.

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,292
-Clarity.

7
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:53,479
-Clarity of the expression of thoughts.

8
00:01:57,146 --> 00:02:00,281
-Common sense.

9
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:11,792
-Awareness and flexibility.

10
00:02:13,552 --> 00:02:17,729
-Concentration and good memory.

11
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,813
-Trust.

12
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:36,219
-The ability to make through
a plan and tolerance.

13
00:02:37,792 --> 00:02:42,583
-Vitality and perception.

14
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:58,552
-Peacefulness, harmony and freedom
and being present in a moment.

15
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:04,531
-The ability to continually integrate
 new information.

16
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:08,208
-Optimism.

17
00:03:10,573 --> 00:03:14,240
-Optimism, that's all you need?

18
00:03:15,042 --> 00:03:25,292
-Compassion and to be constructive and
to have wisdom and also yearn for wisdom.

19
00:03:36,542 --> 00:03:39,333
-Creativity.

20
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:47,396
-Being able to control one's thoughts.

21
00:03:50,281 --> 00:03:54,948
-Possibility to communicate.

22
00:03:57,292 --> 00:04:04,167
-Dynamic, creative, positive way of thinking.

23
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:08,615
-Try not to hurt others.

24
00:04:08,844 --> 00:04:15,865
-The ability to distinguish between right and wrong and to make positions accordingly.

25
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:33,490
-I'm very satisfied that the answers are from people who are thinking and are thinking deeply.

26
00:04:33,594 --> 00:04:38,510
Because the answer, though some of
you did not answer the question,

27
00:04:40,042 --> 00:04:48,177
you gave different answers than
the question requires.

28
00:04:48,281 --> 00:05:03,083
It doesn't matter. Still you thought out things
of the mind which are of a high order.

29
00:05:10,021 --> 00:05:23,531
For me a healthy mind has primarily 3 qualities, which some of you have mentioned.

30
00:05:24,677 --> 00:05:53,219
These are coherence, clarity and creativity.

31
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:17,583
Coherence is somebody who talks in
such a way that everybody can understand.

32
00:06:17,688 --> 00:06:27,021
There is no mixing of thoughts and ideas.

33
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:40,198
He talks clearly and coherently. That means one thought after the other in a correct, logical way.

34
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:57,229
And if the mind is clear in its expression
 of ideas, and at the same time,

35
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:07,521
 that same individual is able to think
creatively, not destructively,

36
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:19,438
you see for each one of these,
it has an opposite quality.

37
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:37,125
Here, in coherence is confusion, in clarity is unclear, and in creativity is destructiveness.

38
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:49,042
A man who is confused is unclear
 and destructive.

39
00:07:57,198 --> 00:08:20,615
And the idea of creativity again contains the idea of being creative for myself in order to evolve.

40
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:38,000
Let us say, I want to live comfortably.
The mind says, I want to live comfortably

41
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:57,375
and tries to find ways to have a good time.
So within these ways of finding ways to have

42
00:08:57,667 --> 00:09:08,427
 a good time, to have a good wine, good food, good woman, good enjoyment, good theater,

43
00:09:08,531 --> 00:09:25,844
good cinema, good television, is this a creative mind? What has he created, what is he doing?

44
00:09:25,948 --> 00:09:33,948
Then there is a point where the mind
 will ask 'what are you doing?'

45
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:52,708
and then he will have a problem. Now this way
of thinking will lead eventually to disease state.

46
00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:02,000
And he will come to you and he
will be so confused, he cannot even

47
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:09,396
describe to you how is he feeling.

48
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:34,021
Now this mind of course can be the mind belonging as a totality here, there, there.

49
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:48,865
There are different qualities of mind of course.
 A carpenter can have a clear mind.

50
00:10:48,969 --> 00:10:56,958
 He can make a nice furniture,
he can be creative.

51
00:10:57,063 --> 00:11:11,156
Whether a philosopher can also be clear, coherent and creative on a different level.

52
00:11:11,396 --> 00:11:19,802
So you are measuring sometimes in
your answers, what is the best mind,

53
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:29,708
a mind near to God, near the truth,
I didn't ask that question.

54
00:11:29,813 --> 00:11:37,417
What I ask is general rules where
you understand more or less

55
00:11:37,521 --> 00:11:45,615
where the mind stands, the mind condition.

56
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:53,240
Because here in coherence - clarity - creativity belong the symptoms

57
00:11:53,344 --> 00:12:11,146
that we see in the Repertory. You open the Repertory and you see "absent minded"

58
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:36,479
 it belongs either to the clarity or the confusion.
"Abusive" it belongs here destructive.

59
00:12:49,750 --> 00:13:15,781
 You see "ambitious" "amorous" "answers slowly", "aversions to answer",

60
00:13:15,885 --> 00:13:24,396
 "difficult to answer" - destructive,
"answers confusedly",

61
00:13:25,865 --> 00:13:35,229
"answers inappropriately",
"answers incoherently".

62
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:43,021
So each of these symptoms you can
see they belong to one of the 3 qualities.

63
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:52,063
When the mind is disturbed, is disturbed in
one, the second, the third or in all of them.

64
00:13:55,375 --> 00:14:03,760
And when this is destroyed in the human
being and then it goes to opposite quality,

65
00:14:03,865 --> 00:14:16,844
 that is the worst minds that we have in the
planet, very, very sick minds, destructive.

66
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:27,375
 There are some people who are sitting in
their offices thinking how to destruct,

67
00:14:27,479 --> 00:14:41,635
how to burn out the planet.
It's literal what I say.

68
00:14:48,042 --> 00:15:02,667
You create and then you destroy, attacking, violence, destroying, the urge to destroy,

69
00:15:02,771 --> 00:15:23,438
to kill, desires to kill. It's a feeling of
destruction; there are sick minds

70
00:15:24,219 --> 00:15:35,667
thinking in this way, they have coherence,
they have clarity and they are thinking

71
00:15:35,771 --> 00:15:43,927
in a destructive way. Who are these individuals?

72
00:15:44,688 --> 00:15:48,615
-Hitler.

73
00:15:52,510 --> 00:16:00,573
Some politicians, never mind Hitler, not only Hitler, we have a lot of destructive people;

74
00:16:01,021 --> 00:16:12,281
they have a very coherent mind, very clear mind and all the time they are thinking how to destroy.

75
00:16:12,948 --> 00:16:19,375
I knew a person working for NASA,
a physicist in America.

76
00:16:19,552 --> 00:16:28,042
He was one of the physicists who
calculated the intercontinental missiles

77
00:16:28,146 --> 00:16:34,646
that will leave Nevada and hit Moscow.

78
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:46,115
He was one of those people who calculated exactly this and he knew where

79
00:16:46,219 --> 00:16:51,844
this is going once the buttons are
pushed. This is going to destroy

80
00:16:51,948 --> 00:17:01,667
this area and they were doing it coolly.
 We are going to destroy this and

81
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:14,562
and this and we have to destroy
 also this. After all this, one day

82
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:25,896
he got very sick and he felt that
he could not anymore work.

83
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:39,354
He did this job 12 hours the day; he was paid very highly but one day he got very sick,

84
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:45,844
he went to the doctors, they could not cure him.
His liver was destroyed very soon.

85
00:17:50,813 --> 00:18:01,729
And then he felt he could not work anymore,
 he quit NASA, he left, you know NASA?

86
00:18:02,969 --> 00:18:14,667
And he tried to cure himself. It took him
a lot of treatment with Acupuncture

87
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:20,948
 and then Homeopathy before
his health was recovered.

88
00:18:21,302 --> 00:18:31,156
I mean they are doing these
things but at what cost?

89
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:39,729
They have to block their mind to
 the idea of creativity and then

90
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:47,583
that quality goes to the opposite.

91
00:18:49,771 --> 00:18:57,115
The man who killed the children he
may had coherence and clarity

92
00:18:57,219 --> 00:19:02,792
but he felt destructive inside.

93
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:24,250
The next question I put it was, what
were the qualities of good emotions?

94
00:19:26,437 --> 00:19:38,260
What are the qualities that will make a
healthy emotional side in a human being?

95
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:54,260
-To be free from passion like
jealousy or fears, anxiety.

96
00:20:03,042 --> 00:20:10,958
-The possibility to express emotions
adequately to a situation.

97
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:19,042
-Satisfaction.

98
00:20:22,177 --> 00:20:27,104
-Laughing, happiness.

99
00:20:30,219 --> 00:20:36,708
-Serenity.

100
00:20:38,552 --> 00:20:42,125
-Peace and tolerance.

101
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:52,750
-To let it go.

102
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:10,177
-Compassion and ability to open your heart.

103
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:24,042
-One to be aware of his deepest feelings, especially those he would not like to feel
and came into peace with them.

104
00:21:26,396 --> 00:21:32,083
-The ability to find and feel the
beauty and love in nature.

105
00:21:33,396 --> 00:21:56,135
-You are better than me. Well, my idea is that in the emotions, in the sphere of the emotions,

106
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:10,854
we have positive and negative emotions.
 So who is healthy?

107
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:24,531
The one who has, who feels
positive emotions most of the time.

108
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:35,635
 One emotion is love - hatred.

109
00:22:43,729 --> 00:23:07,542
You have compassion, you have indifference.

110
00:23:14,813 --> 00:23:23,333
So you want to see how healthy
 you are on this level.

111
00:23:23,438 --> 00:23:41,708
Measure actually your feelings during
 the day. Are positive or negative feelings?

112
00:23:42,750 --> 00:24:00,708
To that extend you are healthy.
Depression - Joy.

113
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:21,896
Question for homework.
I gave you the examples,

114
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:39,948
I want you to write as many positive
and negative feelings as you can think of.

115
00:24:56,552 --> 00:25:14,823
For anxiety the opposite will be serenity,
 for agitation, angry, irritability,

116
00:25:14,927 --> 00:25:27,104
you have to write for me, it is like
a self-examination for yourself.

117
00:25:31,844 --> 00:25:37,938
First you will write the emotions by mind
and then your feelings will come and then you

118
00:25:38,042 --> 00:25:45,229
will remember your feelings and write
them down. And then you will know

119
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:56,219
and you will see that none of us has
positive feelings all the time, none of us.

120
00:25:59,063 --> 00:26:06,792
So there are positive and negative
but where is the balance?

121
00:26:07,219 --> 00:26:12,229
If the positive feelings are most of the time,
 then the balance is towards health.

122
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:23,635
If negative feelings are overwhelming
 then the balance is towards disease.

123
00:26:24,177 --> 00:26:32,635
It is a very characteristic thing that people
will say after a Homeopathic remedy that

124
00:26:34,479 --> 00:26:46,875
my anger is gone. But when the anger is gone, the opposite is replacing, automatically.
