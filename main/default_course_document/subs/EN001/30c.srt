1
00:00:50,800 --> 00:01:04,530
You see we have to be very careful on one more point that we don't always say everything that we see over there.

2
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:11,960
We say what is necessary to be told in order to understand a subject matter which we are talking. 

3
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:19,670
We don't have to go into observation which may be correct or it may not be correct.

4
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:26,420
We may be doing observations on patients 
that may not be correct.

5
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:36,920
So what is necessary for me is to have enough symptoms to make a prescription.

6
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:48,760
If I take privately a case people get mad at me. Three minutes you are giving the remedy?

7
00:01:49,910 --> 00:02:00,460
I said, this is what I need. I don't need to excavate you and to analyze all your soul.

8
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:13,770
We do these cases on the video. When I saw her, she came and she cried, I said Ignatia finished, next.

9
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:20,850
I will not go, what happened with your husband, did he sit next to you, right or left?

10
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:36,440
These are projections that we do not need. You see the remedy, there is no question, ok you proceed. 

11
00:02:42,110 --> 00:03:00,890
I say that especially when you make comments on a case publically. It's not possible that we like each other all of us.

12
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:23,560
It's not possible. We have priorities and similarities and connections. I mean, you don't say, I like or you don't like a patient.

13
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:32,160
It's not important but if you make comments 
and comments may come from like or dislike.

14
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:39,000
 This person does not fit you, why? 
Because you don't understand his position. 

15
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:48,620
You project yourself into his position, how I would act but you think on a different way; therefore he acts wrongly.

16
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,680
This is not a good logic.

17
00:03:52,960 --> 00:04:04,260
Honestly I have never judged anybody that come and tell me terrible stories. I don't remember anything of them. 

18
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:20,230
There is somebody there who seeks my help.
 If I can, I would give it. Whether he's good or bad, 

19
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:37,270
he has killed somebody or he was a killer, a mass murderer, all kinds of projections you may have.

20
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:47,190
He says, symptoms of Sulphur, take Sulphur. He gives me symptoms of Sepia, take Sepia.

21
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:59,230
So, you have to be careful because I have observed in other classes, not at all in this class, 

22
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:06,700
but in public seminars which I have given
 people are criticizing very much somebody who 

23
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:15,530
is giving publically his case. It is very very important to be gentle and say whatever

24
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:22,770
is necessary to say to bring out your
 point but not further than that.

25
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:42,550
You may be a very astute observer and you may find the weak points of everyone especially if you are Sepia.

26
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:55,940
With Sepia because the emotional involvement is not strong, you will make correct judgments about others

27
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:06,810
if you are in a Sepia state. No emotions, you look objectively, then you see the truth. And that's why in Sepia they say, 

28
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:20,880
Sepia is spiteful. That means he finds 
easily your weak point and he says it.

29
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:29,060
Now in Michael's case, is this the case? No. Because Sepia is not his constitutional remedy.

30
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:45,250
It's the first remedy that has to be given because of the influence in his life. He was a different person. 

31
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:53,920
There is an influence which creates a negative impact upon him. Then he becomes Sepia. 

32
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:59,980
We give Sepia, takes the negative, then underneath will come the next remedy.

33
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:07,560
So therefore he will not have all the characteristics of Sepia, he will not have.

34
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:15,510
Because a Phosphorus underlying 
that becomes Sepia, he cannot have. 

35
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:24,420
Phosphorus on the other hand is gullible, whatever he sees, he believes. Why? Because he has a lot of emotions.

36
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:30,200
You talk to him in an emotional way, 
he will believe you.

37
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:47,440
Real Sepia stays cool, observes and knows exactly the weak point. The moment you come into fight, 

38
00:07:47,540 --> 00:08:04,270
she will hurt you very deeply. Because she knows what are your weak points. Did we speak about Sepia? 

39
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:12,570
No, but we have been understanding Sepia more and more and you will see it when we speak in the Materia Medica.

40
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:41,520
-You just said, you don't judge. I have observed that two times during a divorce, twice you asked question for the fault, 

41
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:59,670
whose fault it was? Whose guilt it was? 
If somebody is guilty, he has been judged. 

42
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:11,570
If this is not so, why do you ask? 
What is the purpose of your question?

43
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:26,810
-Well, when I will try to show you the mental-emotional make up of a case, this is the objective. 

44
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:38,650
I have to bring out with the least possible disturbance, this mental-emotional structure 

45
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:47,760
of the patient that we are treating; 
so you can learn from this experience.

46
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:58,530
What is the fault of you or you? What is the meaning of such a question? 

47
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:04,150
There is a lot of meanings in a lot of different levels. First of all you want to see whether

48
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:08,030
 the person you have in front of you, you see 
it for the first time and you don't know.

49
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:19,520
Is he telling you objectively things? Is he 
telling you stories? With a question like this,

50
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:25,220
 more or less you judge the rest
 of the information.

51
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:46,410
If the person says, my wife is wrong, then your mind should go to remedies that are in this or that way 

52
00:10:46,510 --> 00:11:01,680
and then you understand the nature of the remedies. I don't say, this is your fault, no.

53
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:15,020
I just want to see, can he be objective? Is it possible to be objective? Then I will believe the information he is giving me.

54
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:32,980
The information is subtle. I am in a conference and I perspire, I don't feel comfortable, I gave up my job because

55
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:45,300
 in the conference I felt I was judged. What is this? What does it mean? How objective this can be?

56
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:59,190
Do you have to translate this into lack of self-confidence? All this depends on the purity of the information.

57
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:10,330
You cannot believe how many times the same person will say different things. You ask him this way, he will say one thing,

58
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:16,970
you ask another way, he will give another information. You don't have to judge and say, you tell me lies, 

59
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:22,620
you just note down that this information 
he is giving that he is not objective. 

60
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:29,020
Ah, wait a moment, I have 
to be careful with the information.

61
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:41,590
When my reputation depends on whether he will be well or not and it's not my reputation, it's your inspiration. 

62
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:48,650
Finally you say, if you see the result, you will say, Homeopathy is good. If I make a mistake, if I am superficial, 

63
00:12:48,750 --> 00:13:07,210
ok take this remedy and fail, what is your impression not about me, about Homeopathy?

64
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:36,660
-No, I didn't want to say that. I would have asked, who was the first one who went to find out who actually went away.

65
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:46,860
Who had the courage to stay in the situation and actually confront themselves with the problems?

66
00:13:51,360 --> 00:14:04,870
-It doesn't matter. I mean, I cannot duplicate your way of taking a case like you cannot duplicate my way of taking a case.

67
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:12,380
The fact still remains, you are interested about reliable symptoms, on which you can rely.

68
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:22,280
We said this, I thought is this jealousy, yes or no? He said, I'm jealous but still in my thinking,

69
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:29,230
 he didn't say the way I wanted to hear it.

70
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:39,180
His wife also said, when I asked is he jealous she said, yes. In this way ehh.... 

71
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:48,560
Then I wanted to think, it's not judgment,
 it is analyzing so you get the objective truth.

72
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:56,860
  And I came to the possibility that most probably he didn't want social affairs because of jealousy.

73
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:03,030
Because I have seen it before happening. You know the jealousy is so much, they protect.

74
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:10,150
No, don't go there I have a headache. The moment they feel you will go to a particular place 

75
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:16,680
where there might be somebody whom you like, the Lachesis will have a headache,

76
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:25,980
 they will even develop fever, will do different things not to go. Not to be there, not to be near.

77
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:37,560
Then you become unsocial. Is this a case?
 It is a matter of analyzing correctly. 

78
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,580
- During the case taking I have a problem. When you take a case, it's not only the information

79
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:52,730
 that the patient gives to you but you, yourself
 are observing. You are part of the thing.

80
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:59,600
For instance, let's take the Aurum case. When we took the case most of us lived that and I lived that as well, 

81
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:05,300
that we have actually to battle struggle 
with our own emotions that came up.

82
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:13,080
Is it advisable not to take a 
case like that or what can one do?

83
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:26,350
-When you have a case, the case it is whatever you see in front of you. You cannot manipulate the case 

84
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:34,450
to change the way she is giving the case. This is the way this person decides to give her case. 

85
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:42,250
So you take this information and you evaluate the information. You cannot say, it's good to take the case 

86
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:55,920
in this way that means not to allow the person to cry or to promote crying, no.  I don't do anything of that type.

87
00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:06,030
 I let anybody to develop the symptomatology and the expression that he prefers to give.

88
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:13,520
I don't say, don't cry or don't do 
that, let your emotions out.

89
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:20,700
-The question was I have my own personality and I take it in the case and the reaction of the patient 

90
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:29,940
is always the reaction of my inner feeling. To observe myself to be quite objective is nearly impossible.

91
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:45,610
-Well, maybe it's difficult but not impossible. I have said that we must be very objective and sit back  

92
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:54,100
and detach from the patients emotions, as much as possible. Then we make a correct judgment. 

93
00:17:54,200 --> 00:18:02,420
If we are involved ourselves in the emotions, then most probably the judgments will go wrong. 

94
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:09,370
Because this time you will feel pity, the other time you will sadness, next time you feel joy,

95
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:19,870
I like her, then you have sexual feelings 
and things like that. She likes me, forget it.

96
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:26,730
Forget judgment, you have to be objective. Your patient is your patient.

97
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:37,650
I had a case in Athens where I have medical doctors working there. Some of them are the type of the doctor 

98
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:46,750
who always receive very well the patient 
and also console them.  

99
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:55,240
Sit down, what's your problem? People like it. The patient likes it.

100
00:18:55,340 --> 00:19:06,760
Most of his cases were going wrong but still his patients were coming back to him in spite of not getting better.

101
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:16,950
A few cases like this, they behave with such love and the patient feels the doctor likes me.

102
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:25,240
 The doctor has learned to show his
 feelings. Forget the judgment.

103
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:37,030
  Finally the case would come to me because it's not doing well, 1,2,6 months, sometimes 1 year.

104
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:46,910
Nothing has happened, the case comes to me. Whose cases come to me after a year of not feeling better?  

105
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:55,340
It was his cases. Who is full of patients? It's him. Why? Because he involves his symptoms.

106
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:09,050
If you involve your sympathy to the patient, you will have clients but you will not be successful prescriber.

107
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:21,380
-I want to say to this jealousy. Now I understood why we didn't see it so clearly. Because Lachesis has big suppressions 

108
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:31,710
and he even suppressed the biggest Lachesis symptom. So we got a double Lachesis but he wasn't conscious about it. 

109
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:39,640
He told us what he could and then we have to discover that he was so Lachesis that he suppressed 

110
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:46,770
the biggest Lachesis. Now I understand why often I don't see symptoms because I used to say, 

111
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,090
Lachesis you must see jealousy.

112
00:20:50,840 --> 00:21:02,510
-But when I asked him, he said yes. He answered straight. But there is yes and yeeess! 

113
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:14,400
It's different. Yeeess, I realize I am 
jealous. Or oh my god I'm very jealous. 

114
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:27,500
But when I asked, are you jealous? He said, yes. He let some doubt in my mind and then his wife

115
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:39,250
came who let more doubt. I said, what's going on. Then let me think. Something is not right. 

116
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:53,340
In my mind I want to be in peace with my mind when I prescribe. I prescribe for this and that reason and these are quite strong.

117
00:21:56,370 --> 00:22:10,950
I said, let' s forget it. Then I thought about it and
 I said, tell me more about this element. He said, yes it is true 

118
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:25,920
 I don't want to socialize because I was jealous. To admit that it is an absolute seal for Lachesis. 

119
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:37,760
You are too involved with the case. I like, don't like should not come to the picture.

120
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:47,600
-May I come back about the story of taking a case? You explain that you have to be very observant 

121
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:59,190
but at the same time you have to be detached.
 A person who comes as a patient and gives you sometimes 

122
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:09,060
such a personal information who sometimes never give to anybody else, including his own family, 

123
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:15,020
has a certain communication with the practitioner, otherwise it's not going to open up.

124
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:27,340
-Ok, I'll tell you the secret. There is a secret in that. I say, detached. I don't say disinterested,

125
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:35,190
 be very interested, what you 
are going to hear is very important.

126
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,730
But don't get involved emotionally. 
So I'm interested very much to hear, 

127
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:54,080
I'm very attentive for you. When you look 
at me you will say, he's interested in me but 

128
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:59,540
I don't get involved with your emotions 
unless it is very, very strong case.

129
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:12,760
Like her case, it was difficult not to get
 involved. I got involved in her emotions 
and I have admitted it.

130
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:24,340
Very seldom this happens to me and very little, not much. You cry and I cry, we embrace each other and we cry together.

131
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:33,860
It's a healing crisis, I don't know maybe some crazy psychologists may do that.

132
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:47,820
I had a case actually, I prescribed Medorrhinum. He was 15 years with psychologists. So 15 years

133
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:58,380
 all these crazy things she has been told. 
Do this, do that. Now he said, the last month
 I feel better 

134
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:07,540
and you know what? I telephoned my psychologist who said to me that I must change the exercise

135
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:15,910
 I was doing before. I said, what was the exercise? The exercise was that I had to wake up

136
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:31,400
 and don't jump out of bed, wake up slowly, turn to the right, then get out of bed, go to the sun and touch 

137
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:40,860
 the ground and then I'm grounded, the patient is grounded and then he can go to work. 

138
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:53,410
That' s ok, 15 years now this person is with anxiety and starting symptoms of M.S., paralytic symptoms. 

139
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:11,560
He telephoned and said, Dr.Vithoulkas gave
 me a remedy and the psychologist said, very good, take the remedy.

140
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:24,860
But what exercise you do? No, no, no. 
You wake up slowly, you turn to the left, 
then to the right 

141
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:40,730
 and then you get up. He says, is so important? Absolutely important. The patient says, the psychologist said 

142
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:59,100
that finally he got the right exercise for me. 
 And that's why I'm feeling better. I said to him, very nice.

143
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:13,440
 Next time you have a relapse turn to your left, turn to your right and come to tell me what is happening.

144
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:27,940
  He said, 'I was so angry with him because I told him 15 years you have not showed me the correct exercise'.

145
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,950
Most probably he did this to exploit me. 
I don't think so, I said.

146
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:45,170
He goes back and he said, 'why now you 
gave me the correct exercise?'. He said,
 'now I perceived it'.

147
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:59,200
I said, out of 15 years of psychotherapy it is suddenly and accidentally this month that I prescribed 

148
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:09,390
 Medorrhinum 10M, that you are feeling so well, that the right exercise of the psychologist was given.

149
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:35,260
We have to deal with these issues as well. 
I took the case, it took me 1,5h take the remedy and left.

150
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:46,360
Now he wanted contact, the psychologist says this. Now the psychologist produced the cure. 

151
00:28:46,680 --> 00:29:00,550
Why? Because the psychologist is interested. 
I'm not interested. I've done my job.

152
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:11,920
I've done what I think it's right for him and
 I leave him, be free. Do whatever you like,
 it's not my job after that.

153
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:27,890
Do you want patients? Turn to the right, turn to the left. When I heard that I said, 'oh my God'.

154
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:42,210
We have to deal with all these nonsense. 
Now he's trying to get in contact with me, 
it's not possible.

155
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:55,090
Wait, let us see what happens
 with the left and right. 

156
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:02,160
I had another case, 
he never came to one lecture.

157
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:10,430
You know the Greek doctors have learned Homeopathy, just by listening. Many of 
them they did not know English.

158
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:21,120
They became quite good. He, never came 
to a lecture. The lecture starts at  20:00 and ends at 23:00.

159
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:37,580
About 22:50, he appears. He sits there 10 minutes, then we leave. This doctor had a lot of clients but still 

160
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:50,350
after 25 years he had somebody else prescribing for his cases. But still he had a lot of patients because 

161
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:59,880
he is very nice to the patient though very mediocre success.
