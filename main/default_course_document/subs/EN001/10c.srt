1
00:01:34,802 --> 00:01:52,250
Thank you very much for your warm welcome.
 I would say that usually the Mediterranean people, Greeks and Italians, usually

2
00:01:52,354 --> 00:02:04,542
we think about the Northern people as much more cool or phlegmatic, which I see it doesn't apply to Homeopaths.

3
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:15,885
I also see here in England a very encouraging phenomenon for the world.

4
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:41,938
We're with a member of the Parliament with
 the status of Lord Ennals standing here
in front of some wired people perhaps,
and try to understand them, and also try to support from the political point of view.

5
00:02:42,688 --> 00:02:59,708
And this is what I feel, everybody feels that democracy is for. I really feel that it would be
 very nice also if such a phenomenon

6
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:22,031
would happen also in Greece where a politician would stand up and proclaim that I am a supporter of what you are claiming to be a good way of therapy, a good way of helping people.

7
00:03:22,073 --> 00:03:37,229
In Greece perhaps we have very good Homeopathy but so far, there was not once
 that a Minister of Health would come up

8
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:55,708
and support openly. Of course secretly everybody supports Homeopathy but to
stand up here like Lord Ennals is an
encouraging phenomenon.

9
00:03:55,813 --> 00:04:06,313
 And I really think that people of his courage
 and understanding should be supported
by us as well.

10
00:04:06,417 --> 00:04:16,031
Don't forget that we need the politicians
and the government and the authorities
 as much as they need us.

11
00:04:17,073 --> 00:04:31,729
And you must not forget also that a healthy government will always take healthy
decisions. Not always in favor of war but sometimes in favor of peace.

12
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:47,281
It's very nice to hear nice words and
I want to thank Lord Ennals for his
kindness to be present today.

13
00:04:48,583 --> 00:05:11,031
I also would like to thank the Hale clinic
which did a lot to organize this event together with the society of Homeopaths and especially Steve Gordon who did quite a lot for
 helping this event.

14
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:54,500
With this introduction, I'm usually not a good speaker, I cannot find easily my words. I would like to start with the seminar and with what we are going to talk in the next 3 - 4 days.
I don't like to speak in front of this podium.

15
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:46,281
Well I don't know whether the politicians are more threatened or myself because I feel that
I have created through my teaching a lot of
upheavals and a lot of conflicts and
I would say a lot of enemies.

16
00:06:48,094 --> 00:07:07,104
But if one is the type of the person I am,
who'd like to say what I think is right always,
it is natural that I will create disturbance.

17
00:07:17,531 --> 00:07:38,823
I don't like lights, I like contact, I like
to see you. We have to accept our fate.

18
00:07:46,438 --> 00:08:08,740
I would say that one of our subjects in this seminar is the difficulty that a homeopath faces in picking from a patient the right information.

19
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:33,073
Collect the right information and then using it properly is the crux of the matter. It's really what brings about success. And there is
 a lot of confusion concerning this subject.

20
00:08:39,219 --> 00:09:06,458
When you have a patient in front of you and he starts telling his story, as you know, many times he is saying a lot of things which are irrelevant,
a lot of things which we cannot utilize,
we can not use in the analysis of his case.

21
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:41,354
But what we are interested in mostly is his symptomatology. We cannot say that we have
 an idea of him being Phosphorus because
he is tall and lean, this is not good Homeopathy.

22
00:09:44,115 --> 00:09:58,771
Many times there was a lot of confusion concerning what I was teaching. It was said, oh George brought into Homeopathy, essences.

23
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:08,750
So if you know the essence, you can prescribe and you can be successful. And the moment
I started talking about essences

24
00:10:08,854 --> 00:10:23,271
and the essence of a case, it was confusion,
 the idea was disseminated in the wrong understanding, in the wrong way.

25
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:36,052
And in no time, people would say,
oh George says you can prescribe only on essence. And what is essence?

26
00:10:36,156 --> 00:10:45,635
And then I had to come up and clarify
and say that George is not prescribing
always on essence.

27
00:10:45,740 --> 00:11:09,542
Essence means the mental-emotional symptomatology of a case, we call it more
or less - I mean it can also be physical symptomatology - the essence of the case.

28
00:11:09,792 --> 00:11:18,823
 But there are people who are healthy in
 mental-emotional level, what shall we do then?

29
00:11:18,927 --> 00:11:44,875
 Therefore I said that we can prescribe on essence, we can prescribe on totality of the symptoms, we can prescribe on keynotes
or we can prescribe on a combination of the
information of all this.

30
00:11:45,917 --> 00:11:59,604
And of course we have the causative factor that we take into consideration many times and the causative factor many times plays a very important part in our prescription.

31
00:12:04,104 --> 00:12:25,583
What I would like to speak today...first is to
clarify what is a symptom. What is a symptom?
And how a symptom is evaluated.

32
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:42,083
I'm going to speak about the 4-dimensional
 entity of the symptom.

33
00:12:44,938 --> 00:13:14,104
Usually in homeopathic teaching we know that we speak about the intensity of a symptom,
 how strong a symptom is and we speak about time, duration. How long that symptom stays
 with the patient, how much occupies him?

34
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:42,958
Which are the other two dimensions of a symptom in Homeopathy? Can anybody
tell me? Which is the third dimension of a symptom that makes the importance of a symptom to become bigger?

35
00:13:46,729 --> 00:14:10,625
-Relationship to the central delusion.

36
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:21,125
-Location.

37
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:30,510
-Peculiarity.

38
00:14:34,354 --> 00:14:53,021
-So to put it in one word, the 3rd dimension
is the depth of the symptom, how deep it is
 within the organism.

39
00:14:53,125 --> 00:15:09,281
Its hierarchical state and according to the model
I have brought about, can you project the model?

40
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:29,500
Most of you know that I have brought about a model for health on which I have depicted the mind and the spiritual part of the human being

41
00:15:29,604 --> 00:15:49,271
as the innermost cone and outside more peripheral to that is the emotional body and closing all that, is the physical body.

42
00:15:51,104 --> 00:16:06,469
So the importance of a symptom becomes greater, the greater its depth in this particular understanding of the human being.

43
00:16:12,146 --> 00:16:26,948
So for the importance of a symptom
we must take into consideration the
depth from which it arises.

44
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:49,854
The 4th dimension of a symptom is, you said
it also, its relationship to the information
 we have on the Materia Medica.

45
00:16:53,667 --> 00:17:08,146
Unfortunately there are symptoms which
may be very peculiar, very well established;
for instance in a patient with a heart

46
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:25,490
problem, you may have a stitching pain in
the heart while urinating. The urination is
 interrupted during the pain and then starts again.

47
00:17:26,542 --> 00:17:33,833
Very peculiar symptom, you would be very
happy to know which is the remedy, eh?

48
00:17:34,823 --> 00:17:47,792
From all points of view, this symptom is very important for all the three but in relation to the information we have is totally useless.

49
00:17:49,073 --> 00:18:16,906
So therefore the importance of a
symptom depends on all these factors.
All these factors have to be there strong
or less strong but all of these factors
have to be there to evaluate a symptom.

50
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:36,344
And if a symptom is the expression
 of the defense mechanism that says
well this is the way I'm fighting disease.

51
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:50,750
A syndrome which is a totality of symptoms,
 is equally the same and with the same qualifications.

52
00:18:51,417 --> 00:19:20,833
I will give you an example. For instance,
if somebody with high fever tells you that
 I have very hot head and very cold feet during high fever, what is the remedy? Belladonna.

53
00:19:22,146 --> 00:19:35,146
Immediately you have connected the intensity, very hot head, very cold feet, very cold extremities with the information

54
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:48,365
you had from the Materia Medica, you
 associate to, you say Belladonna, you give Belladonna and the patient does not recover.

55
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:14,698
Why he does not recover? Because sometimes of course is not Belladonna, because there
are other remedies which have similar symptomatology. What you missed?

56
00:20:14,802 --> 00:20:42,229
But does the Belladonna want to be fanned?
 No she feels hot but no air, no movements, why? Because if you make any movement his head feels pumping and it is very painful.

57
00:20:43,271 --> 00:21:02,490
You see, the same situation very cold,
puts a lot of clothes on the body and you
see the face wants the fan but a lot
of blankets on the body.

58
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:22,979
You have not noticed that the whole body
was cold and he wanted to be fanned; that's another symptom all together and then,
what is the remedy?

59
00:21:25,573 --> 00:21:41,656
Arsenicum is the remedy because we
know that Arsenicum is so cold, so chilly,
fever comes with chills.

60
00:21:42,448 --> 00:21:57,052
But the head remains warm in acute conditions, not in chronic. So you pick up 2-3 symptoms
and you say, that's the remedy.

61
00:21:57,156 --> 00:22:36,604
Where I'm driving at? A time when having enough information in your mind, in your knowledge you will be able to recognize syndroms and say, this is clear cut in case
of Arsenicum, a clear cut case of Belladonna.
And then you will be able to prescribe
more correctly.

62
00:22:58,865 --> 00:23:20,552
How do you get intensity? Is the patient
going to tell you always about the intensity
 of his symptoms? Not always.

63
00:23:24,573 --> 00:23:35,833
I saw lately, well I didn't see but through the telephone, you know I'm working on
an island, I'm writing the Materia Medica

64
00:23:35,938 --> 00:23:46,938
as you know, and I have a fax, I have a telephone and I'm in charge of the clinic in Athens with 30 medical doctors.

65
00:23:47,042 --> 00:24:10,406
Sometimes they have a problem and they pick up the telephone and say, this is the situation.
So they pick up the telephone and one of the doctors says, well my child has a very high fever since yesterday I have prescribed this

66
00:24:10,792 --> 00:24:45,042
this and that remedy, no effect. The fever
came with chills, there is cough, very
 high fever 40,3 Celsius, I don't know the equivalent in Farenheit. And he is
coughing and there is pain in his chest.

67
00:24:45,823 --> 00:25:21,521
He is quite heavy not exactly in a kind of
 a coma but a little bit close and sometimes
he is talking nonsense. His mind is not there. What is the situation?

68
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:43,729
When I hear this description from the mother
 who is a medical doctor I say, well it is an intense symptomatology not for the patient

69
00:25:43,833 --> 00:26:05,198
 the patient is a 14 years old child lying
there with short breath, pain in the chest,
very high fever. I say, ah he has pneumonia.

70
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:28,813
X-ray to find out, this is a pneumonia case.
His breathing is offensive and also his perspiration quite offensive.

71
00:26:31,417 --> 00:27:03,688
Well for me is a clear remedy because
I was writing about that remedy, that day
I don't know. I said, give Baptisia 200.
A few doses.

72
00:27:13,656 --> 00:27:47,219
What I am interested in now, in this case
 is if I say, well this child constitutionally
 what symptoms he had?
Shall I take into consideration the symptoms before? In which case shall I need to take
that as well?

73
00:27:48,625 --> 00:28:06,573
These are questions you are going to face
 every time. Which is a question when you
 have a case in front of you, are you going always to mix symptoms of acute conditions
 with the constitutional symptoms of the patient?

74
00:28:07,781 --> 00:28:49,021
When do you need the help of the constitutional symptoms in order to prescribe acutely?
If you understand the 4-dimensional parameters of a symptom you will not hesitate very much.

75
00:28:51,656 --> 00:29:03,792
So when you saw this picture of Arsenicum, the restlessness, the fanning, the high fever, the coldness immediately you say Arsenicum. Why?

76
00:29:03,896 --> 00:29:24,646
Because the intensity is so strong. And the syndrome points to a remedy, like the symptom pointed to Baptisia, of course I knew Baptisia.

77
00:29:25,448 --> 00:29:39,698
 If you don't know Baptisia you would prescribe Belladonna but what about the feet? Were they cold? Not so cold but a little bit, you know how you try to make a case of Belladonna.

78
00:29:40,833 --> 00:30:08,938
Let's see, let's see, I think yes it's more cold.
But that's not Belladonna. In Belladonna you have to have really cold feet and really hot face, flushed and the eyes go like that, flushing.
Then you have a typical case of Belladonna.

79
00:30:16,438 --> 00:30:42,635
So you start understanding when to prescribe. Immediately, on the acute information.
When to hesitate and wait etc. and
get more and more information.

80
00:30:50,396 --> 00:31:06,885
Many times you most probably have seen,
in a tooth abscess when the tooth is alive
and the pain is excruciating.

81
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:25,563
Pain, can you think of anything else?
So look at this symptom pain in the tooth,
 overwhelming the whole of the person.

82
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:57,396
But you go to the lotto, the Greeks play a lot
 of lotto, the lottery. You complete a paper
with 6 numbers, you got the numbers and
 you got 5million. You got the lotto.

83
00:31:58,198 --> 00:32:14,813
I don't care about the lotto whether I got
5, 20 million. At this moment the pain is so excruciating. At this moment the person
 becomes one symptom.

84
00:32:15,823 --> 00:32:34,333
Well that symptom has to be treated and
 if you give the right remedy there is
 immediately tremendous relief.

85
00:32:34,438 --> 00:32:53,656
I shall give you an example of that. When you have pain in the teeth, since you don't have
the Repertory I have to use this computer.

86
00:33:11,771 --> 00:33:21,667
Pain in the tooth worse with pressure,
 can you show me the remedies which are
 there? Let me read it for you: Carb-an
in ordinary degree. Cham. in 3rd degree,
 Hyos., ordinary

87
00:33:38,063 --> 00:33:55,542
Kali-bi, Mag-m, Nat-c, Nat-m, Phos, Sep, Spig, Sulph, Sul-ac and Zinc. What do we see from that information?

88
00:33:56,323 --> 00:34:17,208
We see that Chamomilla has a tremendous sensitivity to pressure. When there is a pain in the teeth, Chamomilla has a tremendous sensitivity on pressure.

89
00:34:20,604 --> 00:34:36,417
Even if you don't know that information,
 neither myself I knew the information
 before, so therefore I have to use the
 books, I had to use the Repertory.

90
00:34:37,729 --> 00:34:47,854
So I open the Repertory and I read this information. And immediately you connect what?

91
00:34:47,958 --> 00:35:16,990
From that information you connect the intensity on which you see the person suffering.
 I keep the mouth open so the tooth does
not press at all. When there is an abscess the tooth comes up a little bit. They cannot even close their mouth. Immediately what you do?

92
00:35:21,625 --> 00:35:41,563
You connect the intensity of the symptom with the intensity you see there. And you say to yourself if I had to give only one remedy,
which remedy I would prefer? The first remedy
 I would prefer is Chamomilla.

93
00:35:47,833 --> 00:36:09,792
We see here with the red we have the
capital letters. What it shows that?
The capital letters show that intensity
and also timewise, duration is strong.

94
00:36:10,833 --> 00:36:29,646
So this person is really having strong
 symptoms, so we can look at Cham, Coff,
Lach, Sep and Puls which are with red colour.

95
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:53,323
And immediately what it says, that since
that person has already another symptom
with Chamomilla strong, most probably the remedy which would be indicated
 for that person, is Chamomilla.

96
00:37:31,719 --> 00:38:07,833
The next symptom is pain in the teeth
external, from the warmth of bed, terrible.
Again Chamomilla. You see there, Chamomilla appearing strong and you get another symptom
for his tooth pain which is:

97
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:48,771
once he gets vexed the pain becomes much stronger, again Cham. we see is appearing.
 And also pain in the teeth lying on painless
 side, Chamomilla again is there.

98
00:38:50,083 --> 00:39:12,042
So you have an acute case with tooth abscess. Are you going to prescribe Chamomilla or are you going to prescribe .. because on further
inquiry if you want, to inquire further in this case....

99
00:39:15,698 --> 00:39:27,010
Before we go any further, is anybody here who would not give Chamomilla in this case?

100
00:39:50,833 --> 00:40:06,906
-George I got the impression that in the Repertory black type symptoms have to do
 with the number of provers that came up
with that symptom and not the intensity
which they experience.

101
00:40:07,698 --> 00:40:22,521
-Yes, the gradation we have
 in the Repertory with the remedies.
We have 1 grade, 2d grade, 3rd grade very strong and sometimes we have 4th grade.

102
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:56,146
I have graded certain of the remedies to the
 4th grade. What does it mean? As a general
 rule we can say it means that this remedy
in the proving state has shown many times frequency, in many provers that symptom.

103
00:40:57,417 --> 00:41:29,938
And also it has shown that this symptom in the prover was strong. So it shows in the proving intensity and frequency. Very frequently Cham produces this kind of pain, very stongly.

104
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:47,688
This is why it is depicted here in the 3rd degree. What we see here, we have a patient with equally strong duration and intensity.

105
00:41:53,031 --> 00:42:19,031
And also fitting very well the relation between
 the information in the Materia Medica and the case. What is missing here? What is weak? The third element of the symptom which says, depth.

106
00:42:20,854 --> 00:42:57,740
Is pain in a tooth is a deep symptom? It's not a deep symptom. This pathology is next to skin and then we have mucus membranes and then perhaps one step further. It's not very deep.
 But it is overwhelming. The person cannot live.

107
00:42:58,531 --> 00:43:10,302
I mean if you leave a person until the nerve
 dies, because the nerve will die if you just
 allow him to go with with this pain,

108
00:43:10,406 --> 00:43:26,292
the nerve is totally degenerated and
eventually dies and then it stops the pain also. But the person is going through hell.

109
00:43:28,135 --> 00:43:53,385
Just because of a pain. So what is your
 problem here? You are saying to yourself,
shall I prescribe for a symptom which has no depth? And the answer is.....

110
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:23,729
What I have to show you actually is that;
let yourself feel more what is right inside you.
You have a case in front of you, he came with this tremendous pain, overwhelming pain.

111
00:44:23,833 --> 00:44:32,833
Are you going to think now what
about its constitutional remedy?

112
00:44:34,750 --> 00:45:09,625
I will tell you something. If you do repertorise
 the 5 symptoms, that we have been speaking about, it will come very clearly as a repertorisation process.

113
00:45:14,156 --> 00:45:24,042
The system on which we shall be talking
also about, which I have done in cooperation
with the University of Namur.

114
00:45:24,146 --> 00:45:39,375
It's an expert system; they said we'll
 duplicate my mind and the computer will
 analyze in the same way that you do
 analyse the case.

115
00:45:40,594 --> 00:45:56,146
So the computer can show you certainty on which you prescribe a remedy. Shall I prescribe
a remedy? Yes, prescribe it or no be careful, investigate this, this and that remedy.

116
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:30,198
Say you are given in the computer this information I just gave you; 5 symptoms,
what the computer says? It says the most probable remedy is Cham with confidence
213 and 2022 points for the remedy.

117
00:46:31,938 --> 00:46:45,948
It's a very high score, the confidence is
over 213, and with great confidence you prescribe the remedy. Why it says that?

118
00:46:46,406 --> 00:46:57,260
Because you have given him the acute symptoms on which you would like to
 prescribe, the symptoms of the patient.

119
00:46:57,365 --> 00:47:23,875
And the system says, there is no doubt, this is the remedy. But let us see what happens if you continue and this can happen to you not in a tooth case but in any other acute condition.

120
00:47:26,698 --> 00:47:59,229
You enquire about general symptoms on this patient. You discover that this person has indigestion;  as soon as the food is brought

121
00:47:59,333 --> 00:48:20,344
in front of him, he loses completely his
 appetite. Indigestion especially after milk,
 the pain in the stomach extends to the back,

122
00:48:20,958 --> 00:48:36,240
there is burning on the stomach in the morning and also if he takes honey makes his stomach very upset and painful.

123
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:59,365
And then you discover that his feet are
very warm and he uncovers them during
sleep and then you immediately think,
of what remedy? Sulphur

124
00:49:00,906 --> 00:49:19,083
And you say how are you standing? You know Sulphur they don't like to stand, they like to sit, they like to lie, they are lazy people but don't
put them on a standing position like that.

125
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:36,906
They feel uncomfortable and they have to move. So you discover that she cannot stand at all and of course she has great desire for sweets.

126
00:49:41,906 --> 00:50:19,448
What are you going to do? Can you give me the constitutional symptoms? If you repertorise the constitutional symptoms, what remedy would come? I'll show you the dilemma.

127
00:50:31,292 --> 00:50:40,729
If you repertorise the constitutional symptoms
of the patient, the remedy is Sulphur.

128
00:50:41,083 --> 00:51:02,719
If you repertorise the local symptoms, the remedy is Cham. If you do a repertory analysis
 of all the symptoms, what is the remedy?

129
00:51:09,052 --> 00:51:26,583
How I would think? This is exactly the way I'm thinking. This program does not show anything else but how I would think in that case.

130
00:51:47,167 --> 00:52:02,698
It says, I'm not confident, there are two
 remedies you have to consider. I cannot
 decide which is the remedy.

131
00:52:04,563 --> 00:52:33,500
There are two remedies to be considered, Sulphur and Chamomilla. Which one you will prescribe? You have to be very clear,
you see this is all about Homeopathy.

132
00:52:33,604 --> 00:52:39,990
If you prescribe Sulphur what is going to happen? If you prescribe Chamomilla
what is going to happen?

133
00:52:40,094 --> 00:52:54,583
Who can tell me? I can tell you but who
can tell me? You say with confidence, this is
 the process, this is how I'm going to go about.

134
00:52:57,396 --> 00:53:13,958
Here you have to consider a few factors;
first of all you have a strong syndrome
which fits very well with the information
from the Materia Medica.

135
00:53:14,729 --> 00:53:27,625
Intensity strong, duration strong, relationship
 with the Materia medica strong, 3 factors very strong on an acute case.

136
00:53:28,365 --> 00:53:52,948
You prescribe Chamomilla because in
the acute state you cannot always say,
that when a person has pneumonia
 if I know his constitutional remedy

137
00:53:53,063 --> 00:54:14,813
 and I give it to him, he's going to be better.
 You cannot say that, you have first to
 prescribe the acute and after the acute is finished and you will see the reaction of the person, in that case immediately is coming down,

138
00:54:14,917 --> 00:54:31,438
the pain immediately going away.
The person within a few hours will be much better with Chamomilla and will have
no effect with Sulphur.

139
00:54:31,542 --> 00:54:52,594
You just waste your time and the remedy, why? Because after Chamomilla has acted then
it is the time for Sulphur to give,  to help him
 with his stomach, with his constitutional,
with his chronic condition.

140
00:54:55,813 --> 00:55:16,750
So we make some rules if we understand,
 clear picture, strong symptoms for the
remedy, you must prescribe that remedy
 for the acute condition.

141
00:55:26,146 --> 00:56:00,854
I will give you another example. In a case of coryza. Just give me the first 6 symptoms that you can project. You have a coryza where
 there is an obstruction of the left nostril

142
00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:20,833
 where the child is boring his finger and
picks his nose. He does this so much that
the nose bleeds.

143
00:56:21,604 --> 00:57:11,083
The nostrils are raw, discharge is much more
 in the afternoon and the lips are full of cracks.
You see a child boring his finger into his nose, the nose is red, raw, painful. The lips are cracked, bleeding.

144
00:57:13,917 --> 00:57:41,021
What am I describing? Don't be afraid, I'm not playing tricks. I'm describing a typical case of

145
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:49,188
Arum Triphyllum.

146
00:57:55,458 --> 00:58:10,833
If you had put this and you ask this fellow
here to tell you what is the remedy, it won't be difficult at all for him to decide.

147
00:58:11,615 --> 00:58:23,104
He says, the remedy is Arum Triphylum with 4000 points, there is no question about that. Confidence 200 and something.

148
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:17,573
There is one symptom where it bores with
the finger, there is another one when boring makes it bleed.

149
00:59:26,427 --> 00:59:39,240
These are made up cases. I'm showing you
 the way you pick up symptoms, which
 symptoms are you going to use and which

150
00:59:39,344 --> 00:59:53,542
symptoms you must not use. In the end
you will have an idea, more or less, how
you should think about in such cases.

151
01:00:04,396 --> 01:00:28,792
So if you look upon his coryza, the remedy
which you have to prescribe is Arum-t. If you go and read Arum-t you will see this person is exactly what is describing in Arum-t case.

152
01:00:32,771 --> 01:00:50,750
Let us say that you don't know that this
case is Arum-t and you continue to
 investigate on that case. And then you
 find out that he has some peculiar symptoms.

153
01:01:11,302 --> 01:01:43,292
Faintness from pain in the heart.
There is a feeling as if the heart is hanging
 down by a thread, there is palpitation from anxiety and worse when lying down.

154
01:01:43,708 --> 01:02:07,073
This person is depressed especially in the morning. He cannot lie at all on the left side,
 it brings dysphoria and palpitation and
lying on the left side is much worse.

155
01:02:16,958 --> 01:02:31,500
 He talks a lot and changes from one subject to the other. He is there about half and hour and talks and talks about his mother and

156
01:02:32,115 --> 01:03:01,750
how his mother went to the milk man and the milk man has a child, oh my god this child is a devil...and he had some friends and the other
day they were going to the cinema,
they put fire in the car....

157
01:03:07,906 --> 01:03:25,313
And you realize that this is a case of
Lachesis, what are you going to give?

158
01:03:25,448 --> 01:03:39,229
You see a case of Lachesis and you see
a typical picture on the acute of Arum-t,
what are you going to give?

159
01:03:39,333 --> 01:03:54,833
When we put all these symptoms and we repertorise we may have again a problem.

160
01:04:07,458 --> 01:04:23,448
It says, the most probable remedy is Arum triphylum and also question yourself whether
 this is a case of Lachesis.

161
01:04:41,396 --> 01:05:01,969
In this case, for the same reasons we have
 been talking about in the toothache, because
 the remedy is clear and also intense

162
01:05:02,073 --> 01:05:30,156
in spite of the fact that the whole syndrome is
 not deep, it's only a coryza; still you have to prescribe Arum-t first. Lachesis will come after
the coryza is gone and it will act beautifully but not during the coryza, don't make that mistake.

163
01:05:42,563 --> 01:06:19,833
And we have said so far that if a case is clear on its acute symptomatology then prescribe that remedy and not the constitutional one, even
if the constitutional is clear to you during the
 time of the consultation for the acute condition.

164
01:06:22,833 --> 01:06:40,906
Also we said so far and we understood that
 when a symptom overwhelms a case,
it becomes so important that you have to
 take into consideration very seriously.

165
01:06:41,677 --> 01:07:00,406
I will give you an example. I had a patient who was in France and I received a letter one day,
 10 pages symptoms.

166
01:07:00,417 --> 01:07:16,958
What happened to him, he had been in an osteopath, he twisted a bit his leg and after
 that started a sciatica.

167
01:07:17,063 --> 01:07:27,292
most probably there was a bigger
pressure and he had pains, he was
lying in bed for a few months

168
01:07:27,396 --> 01:08:06,250
And I read 10 pages of symptoms, all the systems everything was written down very carefully, what shall I do? I want to commit suicide this is not a life, in the end.

169
01:08:07,292 --> 01:08:13,948
I' m thinking of committing suicide but
I'm afraid to commit suicide.

170
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:27,219
Never mind how much Homeopathy you know, you take all the symptoms into consideration and to make a prescription is almost impossible.

171
01:08:27,323 --> 01:08:43,365
 What do you have to think in this case?
What is the overwhelming symptom beyond
 the local symptoms?

172
01:08:45,417 --> 01:08:56,885
The anxiety, tremendous anxiety, he wants to commit suicide, he saiys, this is not a life,
 I cannot stand it.

173
01:09:17,312 --> 01:09:40,979
There are some people here who do not have the Repertory and did not put up their hands. This is observation you have to develop.

174
01:10:53,448 --> 01:11:10,177
But really as a homeopath you have to develop the observation, the ability to look at a person and know whether he is giving you the right information or not

175
01:11:10,281 --> 01:11:36,646
 and there are many ways of getting to that point. Like you read the paper, symptom, symptom and
he says I want to commit suicide but I'm afraid.
In the Repertory how you will find it?

176
01:11:38,771 --> 01:12:23,448
Suicidal disposition but lacks the courage;
if you look in the Repertory you will see that
the remedies are Alum, Chin, Nit-ac, Nux-v,
Phos, Plat, Rhus-t, Sulph and Tabac.

177
01:12:32,302 --> 01:12:53,313
There are two overwhelming symptoms for me when I read this letter. The one is a tremendous anxiety through all these pages.
He even had a pimple in his right ear.

178
01:12:54,063 --> 01:13:14,833
Do you understand the anxiety?
Thinking, writing pages, pages,
all the symptoms say anxiety about health.

179
01:13:14,938 --> 01:13:55,448
If we look, anxiety about healthy in the
 Repertory, look one remedy stands out, Nit-ac. We all know Nitric acid has tremendous anxiety about health. With the other symptom 'I want to commit suicide but I lack courage'

180
01:13:55,771 --> 01:14:45,010
these two symptoms are overwhelming the case and put aside all the details that were written in this letter by that person. So of course Nit-ac took him out of bed and he could walk again. This is a case where we say I prescribe on the essence of the case.

181
01:14:50,750 --> 01:15:00,969
-China lacks courage and it's also
anxiety about health. What about that?
It also wants to commit suicide.

182
01:15:01,073 --> 01:15:17,979
-Yes, the difference is this: that China has
 some anxiety about health. Nit-ac has tremendous anxiety about health.

183
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:51,292
Therefore underline the anxiety 3-4 times.
 Which is the remedy that has an equal anxiety, we have to match the intensity and the
 frequency of the symptom with what
 we have as information in the Repertory.

184
01:15:51,510 --> 01:16:25,625
That' s why we chose Nit-ac instead of China.
If the anxiety was less, if he would say instead
 of having his leg pulled up, he would say
 I had a hemmorhage going on for quite a
period of time and now I feel suicidal.

185
01:16:25,729 --> 01:16:45,333
 Why China feel suicidal? Because there
 is no energy left. The blood has gone out
he does not want to live, the nervous system
 is in a terrible state and I say I better die
but of course I'm afraid.

186
01:16:46,146 --> 01:17:17,010
It is a different picture that was coming through the letter I was reading. And this is so important to be able to really evaluate the symptoms and
to understand. I will give you some examples.

187
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:51,042
There are different remedies for the symptoms
 I presented but again with Nux-v we do not have as a keynote symptom, anxiety about health.

188
01:17:51,323 --> 01:18:22,958
Nux-v sometimes they exhibit some anxiety.
 But when you're really searching for a remedy that has tremendous anxiety about health your mind should go to Nit-ac and a few other remedies which are Agar added in the repertory.

189
01:18:26,865 --> 01:18:53,083
Actually I have given to this Repertory about 1500 corrections for the mind section and still
 it needs a lot of corrections.

190
01:19:04,625 --> 01:19:23,375
I have raised Agaricus; I have seen it again
 and again and again in Agaricus, tremendous anxiety about health, tremendous fear of
 cancer, especially. They come and say:

191
01:19:24,188 --> 01:19:43,552
 'I'm dying from cancer'. You see today everybody knows we are going to die from cancer. But we don't have the anxiety but you
 get certain individuals that are overwhelmed
 with the fear of dying from cancer.

192
01:19:43,656 --> 01:20:14,906
Of course you will die from cancer but after
50 or 30 years. I mean living in this world
with pollution, with the ozon hole,
the greenhouse effect,

193
01:20:16,479 --> 01:20:27,844
we know we are going to die from cancer but
 you get some patients that are overwhelmed with that fear, then you think of Agaricus.

194
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:48,292
But you see Nux-v is there anxiety about health but sometimes very seldom and some anxieties which are not so overwhelming as the Nit-ac.

195
01:20:48,417 --> 01:20:57,875
Another remedy which is not on your Repertory and most probably you have to correct your Repertory is Kali-arsenicum.

196
01:20:58,417 --> 01:21:18,594
Kali-arsenicum has tremendous anxiety about health and especially about health relating
to his heart. The great fear of Kali-arsenicum
 is a heart infarct, tremendous fear.
