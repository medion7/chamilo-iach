1
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:38,417
This disconnection we're talking about, is very great in one condition which we did not mention.

2
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:46,479
Can anybody think which condition
 a person stays like dead?

3
00:00:50,813 --> 00:01:01,771
-Coma?
-Coma yes. Coma is not like dead. Totally dead.

4
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:13,813
Sometimes they bury them. A state
of apparent death they call it.

5
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:25,531
A person may stay as if he is dead for three days. And the third day they come back.

6
00:01:25,635 --> 00:01:34,104
There are a lot of cases, they bury them
 and they turn around in the grave.

7
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:48,615
Which shows that the disconnection can be really very very great. The more the disconnection, the less life gives to the body.

8
00:01:50,719 --> 00:02:03,260
I don't know the German medical term but the English term is "apparent death". In Greek the word is "necrophania".

9
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:17,771
It looks like clinically dead. It looks like but it is not. The doctor can check and feel the person has died.

10
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:29,990
There is no heartbeat. But actually after 2-3
days they can come back. You don't know?

11
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:53,313
What actually happens is that there is a withdrawal of the consciousness of the person;

12
00:02:53,417 --> 00:03:09,583
that means the mental-emotional part withdraws together with the vital energy and goes to the next state.

13
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:28,146
So if these two bodies, that means the emotions and the mental, the spiritual part of the human being

14
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:42,792
have managed to create a whole, not being broken into pieces by the time of death, then it stays.

15
00:03:46,417 --> 00:03:57,073
And in order not to be divided
during the time of death, you need what?

16
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:03,635
What is the power that brings things together?

17
00:04:11,635 --> 00:04:19,990
What is the power that separates?

18
00:04:23,385 --> 00:04:32,563
As an idea what is the power that mostly separates on a spiritual level I mean?

19
00:04:33,104 --> 00:04:42,198
-Hatred.
-Hatred, yes correct. Hatred separates.

20
00:04:42,302 --> 00:04:50,625
If you hate somebody, you don't want to see
 him, the idea of separation is there.

21
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:08,510
So the opposite? It's love. If inside the human being there is love, there is connectedness, no pieces.

22
00:05:08,615 --> 00:05:19,542
It will stay together. Not one piece of you loves this and another piece hates that.

23
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:31,646
You know how you are disturbed when you have feelings of that type? And when you have love,

24
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:37,125
you are not disturbed, you are
 in peace, you are not in pieces.

25
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:43,292
So either in peace or in pieces,
you have to decide.

26
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:59,667
By the time of death, if you have peace, you will stay together. If you have pieces, the pieces will go back to their places,

27
00:05:59,771 --> 00:06:07,125
pieces of love will go to pieces of love, pieces
 of hate will go to pieces of hate. It's very logical.

28
00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:13,250
I don't talk metaphysics. I talk facts.

29
00:06:15,615 --> 00:06:40,281
But this, the beyond, we don't care. What we care is, can we help an individual to attain that state which is finally love and wisdom?

30
00:06:41,323 --> 00:06:58,396
Can we help an individual to reduce negative feelings which are making suffering? Can we?

31
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:10,104
And the answer in Homeopathy is yes.
We know that we can change the negative

32
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:20,771
pathological emotions of a person
and reduce them to minimal.

33
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:33,167
Not that we take the part of the person
 himself and his responsibilities.

34
00:07:34,969 --> 00:07:39,042
He has responsibilities, he has to
 do certain things himself.

35
00:07:39,146 --> 00:08:05,333
But the extra pathological, negative emotions which a person has, extreme irritability, extreme hatred, extreme depression.

36
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:27,583
All these feelings we can reduce them through Homeopathy and allow the individual to use his quality for spiritual evolution.

37
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:36,854
Find in which paragraph of the Organon Hahnemann talks about this idea.

38
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:48,083
Hahnemann talked about this idea with one phrase. You have to find that phrase, where it is in the Organon?

39
00:08:54,500 --> 00:09:05,521
You treat a patient and he comes
and tells you how depressed he is.

40
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:23,229
With this depression can you say
 if he can be happy?

41
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:31,854
You treat somebody for extreme
anger, hatred, is he happy?

42
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,437
-No.

43
00:09:33,542 --> 00:09:47,979
-So you see all these feelings, we call them negative feelings but be careful not to think

44
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:57,417
 that anybody can eliminate totally
these negative emotions.

45
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:24,365
The substance out of which we are done is containing the idea of death. We cannot dispense with death.

46
00:10:29,031 --> 00:10:41,125
We say that within us we have life and
death, going together hand in hand.

47
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:53,938
The cells are dying every day and new cells are produced in the body. This we know for a fact.

48
00:10:54,042 --> 00:11:03,365
So the idea of life and death is hand to hand. Also is the idea of negative and positive emotions.

49
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:12,792
So negative and positive emotions are
necessary in order to create our structure.

50
00:11:13,896 --> 00:11:25,667
If anybody lives in a state of pure love
and wisdom and clearness and purity,

51
00:11:25,771 --> 00:11:35,021
can you imagine that, that means God
 is manifesting through this person.

52
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:43,260
It's so much. The energy that no human
being can retain. It will burn out and

53
00:11:43,365 --> 00:11:49,458
it will go to the spiritual world straight
away and stay there.

54
00:11:50,281 --> 00:12:04,208
If we are here that means we have little devils inside us which keep us alive and in this condition.

55
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:14,646
Let's face the fact. Sometimes these little devils become excessive and overtake us and say,

56
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:23,167
 I will kill him because
 he has taken my girlfriend.

57
00:12:24,698 --> 00:12:34,417
Once I was in London and I met a
scientology man. I met one and I said no, you are not good.

58
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:41,063
Bring me to another one, to another one.
So I reached the top man in London.

59
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:56,990
I said, ok I'd like to discuss with you. He said, are you clear? They claim to be clear, to have this state after going through psychoanalysis.

60
00:12:57,698 --> 00:13:07,708
I said, are you clear? He said, yes of course.
 I said, do you have a girlfriend?

61
00:13:07,813 --> 00:13:12,281
He was about 35. Yes I have a girlfriend.

62
00:13:12,385 --> 00:13:26,917
I say, 'can you imagine that I come and take your girlfriend? What will you do?', 'I will kill you'.

63
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:38,563
I said, ok thank you very much.
You answered my questions.

64
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:50,906
Another thing I did with this clearing.
They hold some cables and the engine shows,

65
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:57,063
 if you have emotions, it goes like this.
You have emotions.

66
00:13:57,167 --> 00:14:05,729
So the clear people, you can put any question, no emotions. They can handle any situation.

67
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:18,104
So it was a woman, that was in South Africa. You hold it and I put the question. I put the question, I said, you see?

68
00:14:19,188 --> 00:14:26,104
-What was the question?
-It doesn't matter what was the question.

69
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:34,490
The fact remains they claim to be clear.
Who can be clear? For God's shake.

70
00:14:34,594 --> 00:14:41,313
Even the most saintly people, if you ask them, that's why they are humble, they say we know.

71
00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:52,167
It's only they don't say. We know
that we are tormented by little devils.

72
00:14:53,771 --> 00:15:01,885
By saying all that I may give you the wrong impression that either before you treat somebody

73
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:11,510
 you have to be Gods or that I'm something like that. That's why I clarify the issue.

74
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:23,031
 So this is a good example that
we should not be prejudiced.

75
00:15:25,031 --> 00:15:36,354
I was thinking of Apis and then she gives an information. We change. I have no problem.

76
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:50,417
Yes this is correct, I believe you. Take
Ledum. Not like 'I know, take Apis', never.

77
00:15:53,365 --> 00:16:05,104
And this is a great danger for Homeopaths.
 It's a great danger. Be humble always.

78
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:16,344
Do what is right,
 not what suits you best.

79
00:16:16,448 --> 00:16:26,750
I've seen many cases.
 People insist this is a case of whatever.

80
00:16:26,854 --> 00:16:33,500
 Even if the patient is doing
well with another remedy.

81
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:47,063
I have a case on video. You will see the man brought his daughter, I gave Tuberculinum
 if I remember.

82
00:16:47,167 --> 00:17:01,646
So she was back in America. She went to a Homeopath. She was quite sick and she was much better.

83
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:09,531
So the Homeopath says, I don't agree with Tuberculinum. I will give her another remedy.

84
00:17:09,542 --> 00:17:15,271
She said, no thank you very much
 I don't want it. And she was saved.

85
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:29,323
But the idea is that you don't listen to the person. If she says, I'm better with this remedy don't
 leave it.

86
00:17:51,417 --> 00:18:26,594
I will continue to complete my thoughts. I would say that all this is animated by an energy which is neutral.

87
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:40,635
All these worlds are animated by an energy which is neutral in nature. They are neither bad nor good.

88
00:18:47,833 --> 00:19:01,208
How do we know? That the nature of this energy is one and it is going right through everything?

89
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:17,729
We have a great proof for that. The proof is that when we potentise a remedy which can be

90
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:34,615
 a plant, a mineral or from animal product.

91
00:19:39,563 --> 00:19:51,385
There are three levels of existence.
All the plants. One level of consciousness.

92
00:19:52,656 --> 00:20:03,000
The minerals is another level of consciousness which we consider it as the lowest level of consciousness.

93
00:20:03,104 --> 00:20:13,010
The plant and then the animal. And then we are supposed to be in a higher level of consciousness, ourselves.

94
00:20:14,292 --> 00:20:33,823
When we potentize a remedy from the mineral kingdom, we take a stone, Silica. And we crash it and we potentise it.

95
00:20:33,927 --> 00:20:52,063
We crash it and then we dilute it and then we take one part of this dilution and again we dilute it and again we dilute it.

96
00:20:52,167 --> 00:21:00,854
In the end of 30 consecutive
dilutions what has been left?

97
00:21:03,698 --> 00:21:20,302
Nothing. Energy. Something like of the nature of energy. A subtle energy. A new kind of energy.

98
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:37,083
When we do the plant, we have the same result. We have energy. When we have animal we have energy.

99
00:21:39,896 --> 00:22:04,125
Once we reduce these substances into their energy level, they can affect an energy level which can be homogeneous to theirs.

100
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:30,490
We have electric energy. Can electric
energy be affecting the human body?

101
00:22:30,594 --> 00:22:45,823
No. It can kill it. But it cannot be affecting this energy on the level on which we are functioning.

102
00:22:45,927 --> 00:22:50,521
We are functioning on some kind of energy.

103
00:22:52,854 --> 00:23:03,167
Where from we take this energy? From the same place like everything else, like the animal, the plant, the mineral.

104
00:23:04,563 --> 00:23:12,177
And the proof is that if we reduce these substances into their pure energy,

105
00:23:12,281 --> 00:23:21,417
this energy can really affect a level in
us which is the energy level.

106
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:33,531
So therefore the two energies that run through animal, plant, mineral and the human energy

107
00:23:33,635 --> 00:23:39,792
is of the same basic quality.

108
00:23:42,656 --> 00:24:04,396
It's very logical that there is an energy which animates and passes everything and gives form to everything and if we find a way to bring

109
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:15,302
the substance to its energy level, then
that energy can affect our energy.

110
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:23,146
That means the idea of all
 pervading God etc. etc.

111
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:40,458
Which we have a proof with Homeopathy that really there is a substratum of energy on which we all exist.

112
00:24:41,323 --> 00:24:54,208
So that energy definitely
pervades all these levels.

113
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:18,396
If the two energies were totally different,
they could not have effected at all.

114
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:27,792
You cannot affect inhomogeneous things.
 They cannot affect each other.

115
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:33,729
They have to be homogeneous.
They have to be of the same basic quality.

116
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:56,948
That's why we say that Homeopathy is a healing art which is really based upon universal laws.

117
00:26:00,615 --> 00:26:12,458
So let us see what happens when this energy passes through each one of us and what we are doing with this energy.

118
00:26:12,563 --> 00:26:27,333
The energy as I said, is neutral. It passes through a plant and takes the form of a rose or the form of a stone.

119
00:26:27,438 --> 00:26:44,188
It passes to us and it takes the form of the human being. Then this human being is disturbed and eventually becomes sick.

120
00:26:46,948 --> 00:26:58,917
What actually happens? How
responsible we are for our state of health?

121
00:27:03,365 --> 00:27:16,125
Why we have so many sick people today and where lies the responsibility for each one of us?

122
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:24,792
Can we do something about it and what is the best thing to do? I mean these are questions that we have to answer.

123
00:27:31,167 --> 00:27:40,260
The matter is not very simple but I will simplify it as much as I can and of course as we go along,

124
00:27:40,365 --> 00:27:49,500
later on we can go deeper and
deeper and exemplify more and more.

125
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:08,365
The health of an individual depends on what?

126
00:28:17,417 --> 00:28:45,125
Genetic predisposition. We have hereditary.
We take the good or bad predispositions from our parents.

127
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:51,458
We can do actually nothing about it.

128
00:28:56,125 --> 00:29:14,385
The second that our health
depends on is on ourselves.

129
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:25,771
That means what we are doing
 in every moment of our life,

130
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:33,010
 we determine the state of health
in which we'll find ourselves tomorrow.

131
00:29:37,948 --> 00:29:51,750
So what has shaped our state of health primarily is the hereditary which is behind us, not only our two parents

132
00:29:51,854 --> 00:30:05,354
but a whole series of generations.
We are like the waves of the sea

133
00:30:05,458 --> 00:30:17,854
and we are here at this moment. We bring all this along with us, as hereditary at this particular moment

134
00:30:17,958 --> 00:30:27,771
and then we have our free will and
we decide what to do with our health.

135
00:30:28,542 --> 00:30:38,188
What we eat, how we feel, how
we deal with matters of health in this life.

136
00:30:38,958 --> 00:30:49,885
And then this shapes our health at this moment.
Now there is a third factor which plays, according to me,

137
00:30:49,990 --> 00:31:06,656
 a tremendous role in shaping the health of the human beings at this state. Which is the third factor?

138
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:13,969
-External influences.
-Yes but what influences?

139
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:21,438
-I think it's the collective thoughts
 of all people living on the planet.

140
00:31:23,417 --> 00:31:32,438
-Yes, they also play a part but I'm talking about a factor which really has shaped our state of health at this moment.

141
00:31:32,542 --> 00:31:39,635
A tremendous factor,
very important, very strong, very obvious.

142
00:31:41,229 --> 00:31:47,604
-Education? - No.
-Surroundings? -No.

143
00:31:47,708 --> 00:32:03,000
-Nature? -No.
-Religion? -No.
-Nutrition? -No.

144
00:32:09,031 --> 00:32:13,365
-The western Medicine.

145
00:32:18,927 --> 00:32:44,177
-Unfortunately this is true. We are all victims of vaccinations, unecessary drugs that we took in our lives.

146
00:32:46,365 --> 00:32:53,573
Not only ourselves but even our parents.
In this generation we have also the parents

147
00:32:53,677 --> 00:33:04,896
that were bombarded with hormones,
 cortizones, antibiotics etc.

148
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:16,354
which shaped the state of health in which we are today. And unfortunately these measures

149
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:25,594
 have affected very deeply
 our human organisms.

150
00:33:29,417 --> 00:33:39,927
The people who were healthy enough and
were avoiding taking drugs are very lucky.

151
00:33:40,031 --> 00:33:51,458
You will find them usually in the mountains, people who stayed without medical care.

152
00:33:52,750 --> 00:34:05,521
Who existed with the traditional things which are going on in the villages. They are the most lucky as far as this is concerned.

153
00:34:09,208 --> 00:34:21,083
Of course I do not disregard the fact, I have to say, that in certain cases we have to resort

154
00:34:21,187 --> 00:34:29,594
to save the life of the person,
to antibiotics or to cortizone or to surgery.

155
00:34:30,875 --> 00:34:52,990
But what I am accusing is the wide spread and wide use of unecessary very severe, chemical drugs.

156
00:34:54,229 --> 00:35:08,083
Who is the woman who gave birth to a child without taking hormones, to give birth at a certain hour?

157
00:35:08,969 --> 00:35:22,667
Because of social reasons the gynecologist is free only between 10 and 11 and you have to give birth between 10 -11.

158
00:35:22,771 --> 00:35:30,313
So at 3 o'clock you start taking hormones
 and by 10-11 you have the birth.

159
00:35:30,417 --> 00:35:37,594
But this hormonal effect and what is
going to do at the child...

160
00:35:37,698 --> 00:35:52,125
and then we have the children with cancer. Every year cancer in children becomes more and more prominent.

161
00:35:55,740 --> 00:36:01,104
It's not only that. The child is born,
 they say, it has to be vaccinated,

162
00:36:01,208 --> 00:36:07,052
otherwise cannot go to school,
otherwise we have problems etc.

163
00:36:08,615 --> 00:36:13,792
We are talking about unecessary vaccination.

164
00:36:13,927 --> 00:36:21,875
- Would you like to tell us which
are the necessary vaccinations?

165
00:36:27,365 --> 00:36:35,615
-I'm not going to give answers to all the questions of the human race which we're facing at this moment.

166
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:45,177
What I'm stating is only an information which
 I know for sure, it is absolutely sure that

167
00:36:45,281 --> 00:36:51,396
what I tell you is my experience
and what I know, not theory.

168
00:36:51,500 --> 00:37:00,531
So I'm stating the information.
What has to be done is not up to me to decide.

169
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:08,260
Neither ever any government invited me and say 'come here, let us discuss what shall we do'.

170
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:16,125
Neither I have all the information which
I would need in order to take such a decision,

171
00:37:16,229 --> 00:37:31,500
 and say for instance this vaccination is necessary and the triple vaccination is not necessary.

172
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:40,729
The children used to go through
 the children's diseases very nicely.

173
00:37:40,833 --> 00:37:47,833
Why now they have to be vaccinated so
the child will not get the children disease?

174
00:37:48,635 --> 00:38:26,792
I consider this unecessary. I consider also unecessary the vaccination of  rubella, chicken pox. All these I consider unecessary.

175
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:46,854
They have stopped now but before
 they used to do quite a lot, the small pox.

176
00:38:53,875 --> 00:39:06,396
I believe and I have done a research which almost proved it that the multiple sclerosis

177
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:22,146
 which is so widely exploded today,
is a direct effect of the triple vaccination.

178
00:39:24,208 --> 00:39:38,000
Because you can see multiple sclerosis only on western population. There is no one person

179
00:39:38,104 --> 00:39:42,302
 in Africa who suffers with multiple sclerosis.

180
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:53,688
There was not one person in Asia who suffered, why? Because they did not have vaccination all these years.

181
00:39:53,792 --> 00:40:06,771
Now vaccination is starting entering these countries and you will see these countries also producing a lot of such problems.

182
00:40:09,594 --> 00:40:23,615
I read a lot about M.S. and they had different ideas. One idea was that it was geographically distributed to certain areas.

183
00:40:27,188 --> 00:40:38,604
But there was Israel for instance where
 it had the highest rate in multiple sclerosis.

184
00:40:38,708 --> 00:40:41,833
The highest rate in multiple sclerosis is in Israel.

185
00:40:43,167 --> 00:40:50,938
Which is in the area where there supposed
 to be no multiple sclerosis, why?

186
00:40:51,042 --> 00:41:01,104
Because the Israelis went back to Israel from European countries where vaccination was introduced

187
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:11,771
many, many years ago. So they were vaccinated while in Israel were also vaccinated and therefore they had the problem.

188
00:41:11,875 --> 00:41:20,635
While the Arabs next to them, they had no problem. The Arabs until recently, until 20 years ago

189
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:25,313
did not know what is multiple sclerosis.
They did not know the disease.

190
00:41:25,417 --> 00:41:37,646
The Africans also. Who knew? Ourselves, here in the West with the vaccination and it is absolutely sure

191
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:47,500
 multiple sclerosis is a direct effect of certain vaccinations. Most probably more than one.

192
00:42:02,708 --> 00:42:14,229
-My son is 13 years old now and he is vaccinated for the DPT in the States 13 years ago

193
00:42:14,333 --> 00:42:25,083
and 4 days after that, he had a seisure,
this was when he was 3 months old.

194
00:42:25,188 --> 00:42:29,792
And it turned out that he had a
severe brain infection from the vaccine.

195
00:42:29,896 --> 00:42:36,646
All the conventional doctors that saw him said that he is going to die, he had no chance to survive.

196
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:47,312
They were sure it was a genetic disease at the beginning, it 's a very long story but he had no hope whatsoever.

197
00:42:47,417 --> 00:42:54,813
He came out of this with Homeopathy, with a lot of care and love and support that he had but a lot of other children

198
00:42:54,917 --> 00:43:05,062
that were reacting to the vaccine had died or remained severely mentally and physically disabled.

199
00:43:05,167 --> 00:43:11,594
We have seen a lot of cases like this in the States and a lot of years that I have worked

200
00:43:11,698 --> 00:43:16,021
 with many children afterwards that were damaged from the vaccine and victims

201
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:24,083
and very often after the first vaccine the children had high temperature, swelling, they go into seizures and

202
00:43:24,188 --> 00:43:31,354
the doctors give them another vaccination
 and then they get very severe reaction.

203
00:43:31,458 --> 00:43:36,312
We were lucky because he became sick after the first one and we avoided any other vaccination.

204
00:43:36,417 --> 00:43:42,823
 If we had given him another one, he would be dead immediately. It turned out that this was a lab in England

205
00:43:43,365 --> 00:43:50,823
that was producing this vaccine and after a batch, a lot of children in the States

206
00:43:50,927 --> 00:43:53,750
became very sick, they stopped using this vaccine.

207
00:43:53,854 --> 00:44:03,156
It turned out that it was cheaper than another kind. And it's all money and business behind it.

208
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:12,385
So many victims, generations of sick children
 are becoming victims to this vaccination.

209
00:44:13,167 --> 00:44:18,885
Even what we see in Israel, children that get the polio vaccine because the water is not clean

210
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:24,938
and you can get polio from
the water that you drink, react.

211
00:44:25,042 --> 00:44:29,906
And it was 3 years ago a polio disease in
 Israel and a lot of children were vaccinated

212
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:35,969
and some of them immediately got the polio disease through the vaccination, as a reaction.

213
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:42,948
So we see how Homeopathy is working with like cures like,  and the same can happen with vaccination.

214
00:44:43,052 --> 00:44:50,896
-Well this kind of story I have heard,
in my 36 years of practice, so many times.

215
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:58,979
And nobody can tell me that 3-5 days after
the reaction, 2 days after the reaction....

216
00:44:59,083 --> 00:45:11,750
Now when the goverments have to take some action? I don't know. What kind of action? I don't know.

217
00:45:11,854 --> 00:45:18,531
I'm stating the problem and I say, this is a problem. Do you want to see it?

218
00:45:18,635 --> 00:45:26,083
And not only this problem which is immediate; there is another problem which is much more subtle,

219
00:45:26,187 --> 00:45:32,177
much more insidious and much more dangerous.

220
00:45:32,281 --> 00:45:47,771
Because undermines the health of the planet. There is nobody who is exempt from side effects of vaccination.

221
00:45:47,875 --> 00:45:55,969
Others to a great degree, others to a very minute degree but nobody is exempt.

222
00:45:56,792 --> 00:46:07,885
And if we have time I will talk in detail about my attitude for vaccination and you decide which is good and which is bad

223
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:16,948
and whether vaccination is really protecting or not protecting etc. There are a lot of issues involved in this matter.

224
00:46:17,052 --> 00:46:26,240
And for the Medical Doctors who are here and who are involved with the public health,

225
00:46:26,344 --> 00:46:32,563
these issues should be raised in
every government, in every country.

226
00:46:32,667 --> 00:46:41,458
And we have to say, here it is a problem, do you see it? First see the problem and then decide what to do about it.

227
00:46:41,563 --> 00:46:53,667
But definitely there is a problem. But my point of view is that it's not only these few cases that are immediately so bad.

228
00:46:54,229 --> 00:47:01,260
It's the long term side effects which the vaccination has, which are terrifying.

229
00:47:02,833 --> 00:47:10,083
I went to India myself and I had to be
vaccinated by different vaccinations.

230
00:47:11,229 --> 00:47:17,302
I went to a Doctor, I said, please
give me that you vaccinated me.

231
00:47:18,125 --> 00:47:36,729
Because I knew that it would not affect me. There are some conditions which I will determine for you later on.

232
00:47:36,833 --> 00:47:51,833
What I want to say here is that as the energy passes through us, which is a neutral energy,

233
00:47:57,542 --> 00:48:12,042
 our actions, drugs and hereditary predisposition determines the state of health in which we'll find ourselves everytime.

234
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:31,167
What actually happens is that, that state
 of health is what? If we see it on energy level?

235
00:48:36,281 --> 00:48:55,750
Through these factors we are creating blocks within our body, where the energy cannot flow through, undisturbed.

236
00:48:58,948 --> 00:49:13,958
By affecting the physical organism
very much, we are establishing certain blocks

237
00:49:14,792 --> 00:49:29,385
about which Hahnemann says,
we are affected by the miasms.

238
00:49:32,125 --> 00:49:45,188
Hahnemann understood something almost intuitively. That they were certain cases

239
00:49:45,292 --> 00:49:49,688
easy to treat and he gave a
remedy and they did well.

240
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:56,594
There were other cases that they were difficult to treat and he said, what is going on here?

241
00:49:58,146 --> 00:50:13,417
So he brought out the theory of the miasms. That we were affected, as race, primarily by three miasms.

242
00:50:14,458 --> 00:50:40,323
The psoric, the syphilitic and the
 sycotic, which is the Gonorrhea miasm.

243
00:50:43,927 --> 00:50:53,552
He said, sometimes 1, sometimes 2 and sometimes 3 of these miasms have been

244
00:50:53,656 --> 00:51:04,698
intermingled into the organism and created a state of health which is much more difficult to treat and to cure.

245
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:23,698
This is his understanding. Now he says, if that state is further complicated by drugs, then the case is incurable.

246
00:51:24,969 --> 00:51:32,771
Find the paragraph in which
Hahnemann states this idea.

247
00:51:34,365 --> 00:51:46,260
Slowly as we go along, we're going to build a model which will become more and more clear for you

248
00:51:46,365 --> 00:51:55,344
and will give you a quite precise
idea of what is going on in the human body.

249
00:51:56,833 --> 00:52:09,396
Whether some patient that you have in front of you, will need 1 or 2 or 5 remedies before he is well,

250
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:16,688
whether you should use a high potency
 or a low potency how you should go about;

251
00:52:16,792 --> 00:52:24,708
we're going slowly to build that model
that finally will give us a clear idea

252
00:52:24,813 --> 00:52:36,281
of what we're going to do, what we have to do when in front of us we have a serious case of chronic disease.

253
00:52:48,875 --> 00:53:04,656
The psoric miasm Hahnemann says, it comes from the suppression of skin eruptions in general.

254
00:53:09,385 --> 00:53:19,792
Actually in ancient times most
 of the diseases were in the skin.

255
00:53:24,208 --> 00:53:42,667
In the Bible when they talk about leprous, they talk about tumors and the organism was trying to keep

256
00:53:42,771 --> 00:53:48,156
all disturbances on the external part of the body.

257
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:58,083
And that's why people were more balanced and definitely more healthy in general.

258
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:11,948
In ancient Rome, if somebody was sick he had to hide it because it was considered as a social stigma.

259
00:54:14,031 --> 00:54:21,354
They did not have doctors; the doctors were the magicians, the charlatans, you know around the area

260
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:27,354
and go secretly, I have this problem.

261
00:54:27,458 --> 00:54:36,813
So the whole population was quite healthy,
but what they did? Other actions.

262
00:54:37,875 --> 00:54:44,021
You know the Romans how they behaved
 and what they did with their lives?

263
00:54:44,125 --> 00:55:00,979
How they lived?  Dolcevita, too much dolcevita and then what happened with the dolcevita?

264
00:55:01,083 --> 00:55:16,125
Because it is very very satisfying to have sexual intercourse. It is a climax.  It is a high point of satisfaction.

265
00:55:17,167 --> 00:55:28,344
If you can use this satisfaction, why not?
 Use it every hour or half an hour, whatever.

266
00:55:30,667 --> 00:55:50,438
So from psoric through sexual intercourse the syphilitic miasm and the sycotic miasm, the two miasms

267
00:55:50,542 --> 00:56:02,323
which are concerned with venereal diseases were exploding through the generations.

268
00:56:03,125 --> 00:56:16,375
Why? Because the human beings were using
 a lot of sex in the wrong way, of course.

269
00:56:23,927 --> 00:56:40,635
I'm not a preacher go and have sex and whatever you like, the land of freedom. I'm just stating facts.

270
00:56:42,385 --> 00:56:51,458
I give you the information which is useful for you to know as doctors and healers, nothing more, nothing less.

271
00:56:51,563 --> 00:56:59,031
I don't say 'oh sinners', for God's shake,
 I don't need Veratrum album.

272
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:23,771
So what Hahnemann saw in 1890 or about that time when he discovered, what he saw is that syphilis and gonorrhea

273
00:57:23,875 --> 00:57:35,240
were undermining the health of a lot of people. How this came about? It came about through sexual intercourse.

274
00:57:36,656 --> 00:57:46,906
We know from history how the Romans lived while at the same time it was very shameful to have a disease,

275
00:57:47,010 --> 00:57:49,771
 at the same time they were doing all that.

276
00:57:49,875 --> 00:57:55,240
And then venereal diseases were exploding.
And where came the venereal diseases from?

277
00:57:55,344 --> 00:58:03,771
From where? God knows from where. Some say from the dogs or the cats or monkeys, whatever. I don't know, I don't care.

278
00:58:03,875 --> 00:58:15,510
What we care is that now we know that
 venereal diseases are sexually transmitted.

279
00:58:15,615 --> 00:58:26,708
And instead of having only these two basic diseases today we have modifications of the diseases;

280
00:58:26,813 --> 00:58:37,927
it's a host of sexually transmitted diseases
including the one which is AIDS.

281
00:58:38,458 --> 00:58:44,396
AIDS is a sexually transmitted disease,
a venereal disease, nothing else.

282
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:55,354
According to my understanding it's only a modification of syphilis and gonorrhea together.

283
00:58:56,750 --> 00:59:10,792
A new special bonus that
we get for what we're doing.

284
00:59:13,292 --> 00:59:35,438
I would like to say a few things concerning sex and what I consider to be a healthy way of life.

285
00:59:35,542 --> 00:59:54,979
I'm not against sex but I believe that you cannot have sex, just to have sex. This is not permissible.

286
00:59:55,083 --> 01:00:04,198
That means not that I do not permit or you do not permit but the human body is constructed in such a way

287
01:00:04,302 --> 01:00:15,615
as to function in 3 levels. You cannot separate and say, I'm going to function from here to there. Forget it.

288
01:00:16,927 --> 01:00:28,021
It's connected with the psychic, it's connected with your mental and if you try to separate this, it's like schizophrenia.

289
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:38,948
Promoting a kind of schizophrenia. I will separate my emotions and I will just have some pleasure, forget it.

290
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:43,885
You're going towards schizophrenia.
You're going towards a schism.

291
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:50,156
 The human being acts always as a whole.

292
01:00:50,260 --> 01:01:01,792
The emotions participate, the mind participates
 in an action, in the highest action which

293
01:01:01,896 --> 01:01:12,500
is considered as very specific
moments of communication.

294
01:01:13,281 --> 01:01:19,844
You communicate with the soul of the other person, not with the body of the other person.

295
01:01:19,948 --> 01:01:30,708
If you say, I'm going to communicate only with the body, then you have made a schism and you're going to pay for that.

296
01:01:30,813 --> 01:01:38,594
You are going to pay, absolutely. But not
the way you think you are going to pay, no.

297
01:01:38,698 --> 01:01:55,698
By just creating on your emotions a hard place, a little hardness, a little nodule, a little tumor, a little cancer.

298
01:01:59,344 --> 01:02:06,156
That is hard because you have your emotions and your body says, ok keep going have sex.

299
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:11,281
You have hormones or whatever which are pushing you and then you go and have some sex

300
01:02:11,385 --> 01:02:17,646
 and release them, whatever.
They are different ideas and theories about this.

301
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:27,854
But I tell you the moment that especially a woman, does not have sex under proper conditions.

302
01:02:27,958 --> 01:02:42,177
That means first having contact on an emotional level, on a psychic level and then as a consequence of that contact

303
01:02:42,281 --> 01:02:56,771
to feel loose and to feel happy and let herself into this climax, unless she does that, even a man will have a problem.

304
01:02:58,344 --> 01:03:04,042
Whether she or he likes it, whether
he or he does not like it.

305
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:17,417
Of course you can separate, you can harden your emotions, you can close yourself.

306
01:03:17,521 --> 01:03:36,250
And that is why we see, for instance in Natrum muriaticum where the person is closed and can not express the emotions

307
01:03:36,677 --> 01:03:47,896
they go into a kind of sexual intercourse etc. closed. This makes harder the emotions, the same with Anacardium.

308
01:03:48,896 --> 01:03:57,646
They feel terrified, they feel insecure. They close their emotions, they're feeling that the others

309
01:03:57,750 --> 01:04:13,083
will crush them, they go into sexual intercourse without this connection on the psychic level and then they get hard emotions.

310
01:04:14,125 --> 01:04:20,021
The emotions become harder and harder
and then they have to torture the animals

311
01:04:20,125 --> 01:04:29,417
or human beings or whatever to feel the connection. Because the connection is lost,

312
01:04:29,521 --> 01:04:37,313
 cannot be felt. But you have to take into consideration something which is very important.

313
01:04:37,417 --> 01:04:54,438
That as we are not isolated human beings, I'm not isolated, I'm connected, I feel your emotions, your thoughts, everything.

314
01:04:54,542 --> 01:05:00,438
Everything you think I'm connected. The
more sensitive I am, the more I'm connected,

315
01:05:00,542 --> 01:05:07,792
 the more I feel how each one
has thoughts, doubts etc.

316
01:05:07,896 --> 01:05:24,438
So I'm connected; I canot isolate myself.
If I do isolate myself, then I lose the opportunity

317
01:05:24,542 --> 01:05:49,833
to evolve spiritually because the final state
of spirituality, they say is to connect with God.

318
01:05:51,635 --> 01:05:59,531
 But to connect with something which is supposed to be outside of you, it is to let

319
01:05:59,635 --> 01:06:08,313
all the egotistical elements which
are in us and makes us feel isolated.

320
01:06:08,417 --> 01:06:17,167
So the first action to let lose, is to love somebody else and to start from that point of view.

321
01:06:18,208 --> 01:06:27,490
And to drop the egotism which
is you are there and I'm here.

322
01:06:27,594 --> 01:06:40,594
In a love affair this is dropped and human beings are living the idea of connection with God.

323
01:06:40,698 --> 01:06:53,104
In a real love affair, in the climax, the
 experience is so great, if it is correctly built up,

324
01:06:53,208 --> 01:07:00,313
 that it is the same experience that we have that the saints have when they connect with God.

325
01:07:00,417 --> 01:07:09,240
They let themselves, their feelings are open and they connect with cosmic or whatever they call it.

326
01:07:09,344 --> 01:07:11,948
Each religion calls it in a different way,
 it does not matter.

327
01:07:12,052 --> 01:07:22,594
And then there is this great opening and great satisfaction and then we have the higher state of health.

328
01:07:22,698 --> 01:07:29,729
We'll come to the definition of health later on, these are preparations for understanding

329
01:07:29,833 --> 01:07:37,240
what I mean what I say as definition of health.

330
01:07:37,344 --> 01:07:46,438
And what is health, where it takes us, how we promote health, in which way, where we take it etc.

331
01:07:46,542 --> 01:08:00,479
There are a lot of questions that we have as healers, as people taking the responsibility to take her to a better state of health.

332
01:08:00,583 --> 01:08:08,708
We claim that we know the way. But really
 how many of us do we really know?

333
01:08:08,813 --> 01:08:13,208
And what we're doing.
Most probably we're lost.

334
01:08:18,167 --> 01:08:26,531
Grobing and darkness and searching, trying to find out. I gave a remedy and says, this reaction.

335
01:08:26,635 --> 01:08:28,437
What is this? What have I done?

336
01:08:28,542 --> 01:08:34,156
A lot of people. Medical Doctors also who
 after all do not have such a responsibility.

337
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:37,604
They can kill anybody, anytime, you know.

338
01:08:37,708 --> 01:08:45,281
Medical Doctor can take somebody in the hospital and say, he died in the hospital, no problem.

339
01:08:46,010 --> 01:08:55,125
But if you are not a Medical Doctor and you make a mistake and somebody dies, then you have a bigger problem.

340
01:08:56,167 --> 01:09:05,937
So we have to know what we're doing that the remedy we gave is promoting health.

341
01:09:06,042 --> 01:09:11,865
Unless we know all this theory, unless we understand very well this theory,

342
01:09:11,969 --> 01:09:21,573
forget understanding what we are doing.
Many times I' ve heard, 'I've given the right remedy?'

343
01:09:21,677 --> 01:09:30,260
 A beautiful reaction and I heard stupid comments on that case or some practitioner

344
01:09:30,365 --> 01:09:41,698
entering and giving remedies to spoil the action of the remedy because he does not understand the issues.

345
01:09:47,615 --> 01:10:06,083
So if we had healthy human beings, I will tell you, no woman would have sex unless she was 20.

346
01:10:09,208 --> 01:10:24,333
At least 20 years old to understand what she is doing. Now girls which are 12, 13, 14 say why not I'll try.

347
01:10:24,438 --> 01:10:38,281
See what happens. You see later on, when you are 23 you are dead emotionally and she doesn't feel anything.

348
01:10:38,385 --> 01:10:42,729
Whether she marries this man
 or that man, makes no difference.

349
01:10:42,833 --> 01:10:49,344
She says why not, he is good,
he is rich, I'll marry him.

350
01:10:49,833 --> 01:11:00,771
Good, rich, marry him you go for a husband syndrome. You know I have found a syndrome

351
01:11:00,875 --> 01:11:04,396
which I call the husband syndrome.

352
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:14,271
Which gives us specific type of symptomatology in a woman who marries under such circumstances.

353
01:11:14,375 --> 01:11:24,687
And then the woman come into connection with any man. And then of course she is in danger

354
01:11:24,792 --> 01:11:36,438
of getting all kinds of sexually transmitted diseases. 'What's the problem. I like him'.

355
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:50,812
You meet one person one night, you go and have sex, then you feel nauseated almost because you did that.

356
01:11:56,521 --> 01:12:02,260
When I talk like this sometimes
 there are big reactions.

357
01:12:14,594 --> 01:12:22,906
We say we need health. She comes
there to us and we say, ok what's your problem?

358
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:27,594
I have these phobias, the anxiety,
depressions and all that.

359
01:12:27,771 --> 01:12:47,865
And I said, ok take Aurum.
 Aurum will help him to what extend?

360
01:12:47,969 --> 01:12:56,708
To the extend that he will catch up
with the idea that I'm now healthy

361
01:12:56,813 --> 01:13:05,688
and act accordingly, according
 to rules which promote health.

362
01:13:05,792 --> 01:13:17,000
If he falls back into the habits he had
beforehis health will slowly go down again.

363
01:13:17,104 --> 01:13:27,687
Then again Aurum. Then he picks up, second possibility. The third time he comes and the picture is changed.

364
01:13:27,792 --> 01:13:32,844
You give Aurum, nothing happens. Then you give this, you give that, you give another remedy, another remedy

365
01:13:32,948 --> 01:13:50,646
and then you lost him. He went and took Valium. Now Valium, then more Valium and then Tryptizol and then Largactil.

366
01:14:02,448 --> 01:14:27,510
I give you too much, it's ok? You follow all this?
 You are attentive but I'm not sure whether you really grasp the points.

367
01:14:27,615 --> 01:14:32,688
So it becomes yours, your point,
your understanding.

368
01:14:32,792 --> 01:14:41,490
Because unless you really understand
what I'm saying, you leave with doubts.

369
01:14:41,594 --> 01:14:48,635
You'll say, is this or that?
Or maybe this or that or whatever.

370
01:14:56,187 --> 01:15:14,531
Hahnemann's idea of the miasms is absolutely correct but experience shows that it is not complete.

371
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:27,021
And the idea is that in order to treat an
 individual who is suffering chronically

372
01:15:27,125 --> 01:15:35,948
with severe disease, you may need
to unravel to take away one by one

373
01:15:36,052 --> 01:15:43,010
the different miasmatic layers
that have come upon him.

374
01:15:44,208 --> 01:15:49,156
How you do that? We shall be learning the Materia Medica and then accordingly

375
01:15:49,260 --> 01:16:02,281
we shall see how we handle an individual
who is miasmatically very much affected.

376
01:16:04,365 --> 01:16:15,729
 It's very strange that you may find for
instance, children who are very sick.

377
01:16:15,833 --> 01:16:18,510
And you say, what they have done?
They have done nothing.

378
01:16:21,281 --> 01:16:28,688
 They are sick because of this heavy, this is very heavy, hereditary is very heavy for them.

379
01:16:28,792 --> 01:16:38,240
And you get another individual who is born with a very good health and you find him at the age of 50,

380
01:16:38,344 --> 01:16:47,479
 his health is almost wreck because
 of this. Our action.

381
01:16:48,771 --> 01:16:59,531
 And you find some unfortunate
people usually living in medical families,

382
01:16:59,635 --> 01:17:12,063
who had very good medical care from the beginning years and they were drugged a lot;

383
01:17:12,167 --> 01:17:18,229
they are very unfortunate. Maybe hereditary
it was good, their action is good

384
01:17:18,333 --> 01:17:27,792
but they took so many drugs that
when they come to you, they are wrecks.

385
01:17:34,302 --> 01:17:47,198
And this undermines the organism so deeply that it is very very difficult to untagle such an individual.

386
01:17:47,302 --> 01:17:57,240
You will see when you take a case in front of you, we will take a case and you will be able to

387
01:17:57,344 --> 01:18:07,438
perceive who is good, bad, very bad,
very good, quite good, etc.

388
01:18:07,542 --> 01:18:15,729
You will be able to establish slowly the state of health in which that individual is and you will see

389
01:18:15,833 --> 01:18:24,208
how much these factors will
determine what you have in front of you.
