1
00:00:18,341 --> 00:00:24,741
You are going to give me some advice on this case. I’m confused.

2
00:00:37,945 --> 00:00:40,015
 You can tell this story.

3
00:00:40,505 --> 00:00:46,905
You started having homeopathic treatment, how many years ago?

4
00:00:48,464 --> 00:00:52,815
– 12 or 13 years.
–And for what reason?

5
00:00:53,305 --> 00:00:59,152
–I started with a lot of pain in my bones, like my father did, when he was on the same age like me.

6
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:09,145
It started with a bad lumbago when I was in holidays in Greece,

7
00:01:09,907 --> 00:01:20,912
in Crete and did a lot of windsurfing and then suddenly I woke up in the night like today

8
00:01:21,427 --> 00:01:28,345
and I couldn’t walk and I had a lot of pain in my back, I could only move on my knees and my arms.

9
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:39,114
Yesterday I drove a lot of time with a motorbike and I think my suitcase was too heavy

10
00:01:39,214 --> 00:01:41,906
when I came here 3 days before.

11
00:01:41,907 --> 00:01:53,427
I took Rhus-t. 3 days before, also for my bad inflammation of my chronic polyarthritis

12
00:01:53,945 --> 00:02:02,659
and a day later I got a new inflammation here on the point of my small fingers I never had before.

13
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:12,112
And 2 days I could not take anything with my fingers and all my bones also my knees were very bad.

14
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:20,068
Also my feet, I couldn’t go on my feet and now since this morning my pains on all the bones stopped

15
00:02:20,825 --> 00:02:26,587
but suddenly this old pain that I had years before came back very fast

16
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:33,336
and it’s going worse every half an hour.

17
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:38,499
I cannot move my right leg and I am very painful.

18
00:02:39,779 --> 00:02:44,627
I took a lot of remedies all over the years.

19
00:02:45,392 --> 00:02:55,139
I started with Rhus-t. later maybe I got Arn., Puls., Lyc., Nat-m.

20
00:02:55,385 --> 00:02:59,225
Of course I had a lot of problems in my life.

21
00:03:00,752 --> 00:03:09,712
Later I got again Lyc. and then Med. And all things came back, also pain.

22
00:03:10,227 --> 00:03:14,987
– Just a moment. Let me clarify a little bit because it was very confusing.

23
00:03:16,026 --> 00:03:27,546
When she took Rhus-t. for this condition, it give no results and then she took Arn. most probably,

24
00:03:28,826 --> 00:03:32,666
and then Lyc. Lyc. seemed to help?
– Yes.

25
00:03:34,946 --> 00:03:45,707
– She repeated Lyc. Lyc. helped her several times and then it stopped helping and she went into Puls.

26
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:50,819
Puls. did not give much effect.

27
00:03:53,872 --> 00:04:01,552
– And then Sil. It was going better but nothing really helped.

28
00:04:01,828 --> 00:04:06,948
All the inflammations went on and the pain in my fingers suddenly stopped ...

29
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:12,228
- How many years now are these pains going on?

30
00:04:12,495 --> 00:04:19,385
– Maybe 8 years. Suddenly we went so bad that I couldn’t stand up in the morning.

31
00:04:19,908 --> 00:04:28,620
– So, most probably here we have a case of rheumatoid arthritis which is not a simple arthritis.

32
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:46,026
It’s much more aggressive as a condition and more obstinate. Not easily curable.

33
00:04:47,306 --> 00:04:56,266
The fact that she is having for 8 years already the condition

34
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:01,731
and that she has not a lot of deformities that shows that

35
00:05:01,985 --> 00:05:08,107
Homeopathy has helped her quite a lot so far.

36
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:15,022
You said Med. gave you a negative reaction?

37
00:05:15,788 --> 00:05:18,862
– Yes. All the inflammations were worse.

38
00:05:19,628 --> 00:05:22,702
Also my knee, I had an accident about 25 years ago,

39
00:05:23,212 --> 00:05:30,382
I was operated and suddenly it started again I got operated for 5 years.

40
00:05:31,387 --> 00:05:34,499
For 5 years I had such a knee but I had not time to be operated

41
00:05:34,745 --> 00:05:38,827
and then they opened it when my oldest son had a big accident,

42
00:05:38,828 --> 00:05:41,539
I had the time to lie beside him in the hospital

43
00:05:41,785 --> 00:05:47,903
and then they opened it and all the cartilage was gone.

44
00:05:47,904 --> 00:05:48,666
It was like that all over the bone.

45
00:05:50,221 --> 00:06:01,984
After this was getting on all the other bones and before I only had a lot of pain on my left knee.

46
00:06:04,301 --> 00:06:14,266
Also, when I took Med. all accidents, I was a horse rider before when I was young

47
00:06:15,056 --> 00:06:20,666
and I was falling a lot of times all over my back side and I had one time a bad accident

48
00:06:20,941 --> 00:06:25,024
when horse was standing on his feet and making like that on my right feet

49
00:06:25,296 --> 00:06:33,466
and they wanted to put my foot off but I took a new remedy there and then they could leave my foot on.

50
00:06:34,256 --> 00:06:39,866
This pain is also there now. Sometimes I cannot put the foot on the floor.

51
00:06:40,656 --> 00:06:48,587
All the old accidents are coming back I think. It’s very painful.

52
00:06:49,344 --> 00:06:55,744
– You said after Puls. you took Nat-m.?
– Of course.

53
00:06:57,786 --> 00:07:00,346
– It helped you?
– It helped my mind.

54
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:09,306
I was feeling much better and it cleared up my mind and my feelings.

55
00:07:09,581 --> 00:07:12,656
I was feeling much better and couldn’t feel so much the pain,

56
00:07:13,146 --> 00:07:17,776
the bones were all the time the same like before but I couldn’t feel the pain so much.

57
00:07:18,784 --> 00:07:23,661
But then I stopped I was feeling better mentally.

58
00:07:26,221 --> 00:07:36,186
– Did you go back to Lyc. or took Lach.?
– I took Lach. Lach. helped of course.

59
00:07:36,704 --> 00:07:41,067
I had a lot of problems with my thyroid and then it was gone.

60
00:07:44,141 --> 00:07:57,456
Also my menstruation was going on, but suddenly when I was 38 I got menopause

61
00:07:58,221 --> 00:08:02,576
and I was feeling very bad and Puls. helped at this time also.

62
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:08,186
My period came back a lot of times every time when I took it.

63
00:08:07,104 --> 00:08:11,216
About 5-6 months later I took another one it came back and then nothing happened anymore.

64
00:08:11,981 --> 00:08:14,266
It’s gone since 3 years.

65
00:08:27,584 --> 00:08:32,704
– Altogether in these 14 years how many remedies have you taken? 30, 40, 50, 60?

66
00:08:33,741 --> 00:08:43,981
– 15 remedies. I have a good homeopath but nothing would really act on me.

67
00:08:49,867 --> 00:08:56,781
Between I took Nux-v. but it didn’t clear the case.

68
00:08:57,296 --> 00:09:10,096
– You also took Sil. And now you have this pain in the right sacroiliac junction.

69
00:09:11,376 --> 00:09:14,944
Severe pain, which comes every half an hour?

70
00:09:16,224 --> 00:09:20,336
– No. I am feeling that every half hour it is getting worse.

71
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:23,967
When I turn a little bit around and I want to move my knees it’s getting more.

72
00:09:24,304 --> 00:09:26,864
When I am sitting still and I am walking it’s ok. When I am walking slowly.

73
00:09:27,107 --> 00:09:30,947
But when I want to move a little bit then I have a lot of pain.

74
00:09:32,227 --> 00:09:34,544
Also when I move to the back...

75
00:09:38,894 --> 00:09:41,136
- What would you do in such a case?

76
00:09:47,536 --> 00:09:53,664
After Puls. she says she had all her fears out.

77
00:09:54,701 --> 00:09:56,786
– Puls. and Nat-m.

78
00:10:01,388 --> 00:10:08,547
– When you took Puls. you took it for psychological reasons or for the pains?

79
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:15,468
– For psychological reasons and also for the pain in the fingers and my knee.

80
00:10:15,986 --> 00:10:21,901
– And you had a lot of grief?
– Yes, I had a lot of grief.

81
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:29,824
– You separated from your husband?
– Yes, he was a drinker and I had a lot of bad time with him.

82
00:10:31,543 --> 00:10:34,618
– And your children stayed with you?

83
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:40,503
– The children stayed with me and we moved away when they were 2 and 4

84
00:10:41,018 --> 00:10:45,108
and I only had the feeling that I can do something to change my life.

85
00:10:47,145 --> 00:10:52,024
I only had a few marks in my pocket and I started with a good feeling

86
00:10:52,265 --> 00:11:00,709
and I got very good practice for Homeopathy and other things also Chiropractice

87
00:11:00,984 --> 00:11:11,224
and the people came and I got a good new home and good job and all were going well.

88
00:11:12,745 --> 00:11:20,948
But suddenly I had problems with my new boyfriend and he didn’t want to move to us of course,

89
00:11:21,189 --> 00:11:30,149
the children were growing up and they needed a father, 2 boys, and suddenly I went off him,

90
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:35,269
met another man and I married him 3 years ago but we had a lot of problems.

91
00:11:35,544 --> 00:11:41,944
He is very sick. He is depressed and I wouldn’t know it before.

92
00:11:42,185 --> 00:11:45,268
And a lot of times I would get off him but I can’t, of course,

93
00:11:46,025 --> 00:11:51,909
I changed my practice and my home and my children love him and I cannot go back.

94
00:11:52,184 --> 00:11:57,029
Now it’s ok, it’s working but it’s like a normal marriage, I think.

95
00:12:02,211 --> 00:12:07,585
– Out of the remedies which you took, which is the one you think it helped you most?

96
00:12:10,384 --> 00:12:19,105
– Lyc., I think. It was also the remedy of my mother and my biggest child.

97
00:12:20,385 --> 00:12:22,427
He always takes Lyc., I don’t know why.

98
00:12:30,371 --> 00:12:32,667
– She wants to ask a question.

99
00:12:37,025 --> 00:12:46,747
– Just a question; in what potency you took your remedies?
– First, 200C or 200D and then 18LM.

100
00:12:48,545 --> 00:12:55,971
– And Lyc. helped you most first? 200C?
– Yes.

101
00:12:56,464 --> 00:13:05,424
– And then LM?
– LM. When it worked well we waited and then doctor gave me 18LM.

102
00:13:07,984 --> 00:13:10,305
– And the others the same?
– The same, yes.

103
00:13:10,821 --> 00:13:11,585
– Thank you.

104
00:13:13,505 --> 00:13:21,701
– Sometimes I like to swim in cold water and I have fear about cold air

105
00:13:21,947 --> 00:13:26,051
but sometimes I need it to go out in the cold air and to breathe cold air.

106
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:28,611
– You have fear of cold air?

107
00:13:29,104 --> 00:13:36,384
– When it’s too cold and sometimes I need to go out, I open the window, I need fresh air.

108
00:13:37,146 --> 00:13:45,101
I think it was Puls. all the time. But I want to have fresh air all the time.

109
00:13:45,344 --> 00:13:48,176
I cannot sleep when there is no window open in the night.

110
00:13:48,176 --> 00:13:52,267
– Is there anything that affects the joint pains?

111
00:13:52,781 --> 00:14:01,227
– They are better in warm or very hot water or very cold, with ice.

112
00:14:08,907 --> 00:14:20,941
I love to swim in very hot water. The stiffness is gone when I spend a lot of time in hot water.

113
00:14:23,226 --> 00:14:25,827
And the stiffness every morning is very bad

114
00:14:26,102 --> 00:14:33,977
when I wake up I can’t move along from my bed and I have to put on...of course of my knees also.

115
00:14:36,786 --> 00:14:43,948
– Let me give you my thought, so far about the case.

116
00:14:46,262 --> 00:14:53,426
Here from a homeopathic point of view we don’t have any kind of real information.

117
00:14:55,737 --> 00:15:03,907
Of course we know this is a woman she has been through a lot of stresses, grief, at the same time,

118
00:15:04,182 --> 00:15:10,582
at a certain point she develops rheumatoid arthritis she has taken several remedies,

119
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:15,948
some have helped, some have not, some have more, some less.

120
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:25,988
This so far, as far as we are concerned at this historic moment in her case

121
00:15:26,263 --> 00:15:34,137
 we don’t know anything about the case. We don’t have any information on which we can prescribe.

122
00:15:36,697 --> 00:15:44,377
Either we have to try to do what? Can anybody tell me?

123
00:15:45,142 --> 00:15:51,267
What do we have to try to do at this moment? We are facing this problem.

124
00:15:52,057 --> 00:15:58,948
Lyc. has helped, let’s try it again or whatever.

125
00:16:01,267 --> 00:16:04,584
She wanted to take another dose of Rhus-t.

126
00:16:10,743 --> 00:16:15,588
 What will you do in such a situation?

127
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:22,504
I must say this is the worst situation that you can be in.

128
00:16:25,587 --> 00:16:33,570
Because the case appears like that I will you give some information concerning

129
00:16:33,824 --> 00:16:39,667
 what we have been talking this moment. It’s interesting what she’s telling.

130
00:16:40,183 --> 00:16:45,818
She says 15 days ago I started with Rhus-t.

131
00:16:48,104 --> 00:16:49,143
– 4 days ago.

132
00:16:50,423 --> 00:16:53,747
– When did you start?
– 14 or 15 years ago.

133
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:59,624
– What remedy?
– Rhus-t. Because of the lumbago.

134
00:17:01,668 --> 00:17:05,945
– Was this the same thing or different?
– I think it was the same.

135
00:17:07,225 --> 00:17:16,947
– Started with Rhus-t. And then it did not help. And then Arn., did not help.

136
00:17:17,712 --> 00:17:28,739
The pain kept rising and then Lyc., it went down and then it started coming again,

137
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:36,419
Lyc. again most probably and then Lyc. again and again. Something like that happened.

138
00:17:37,188 --> 00:17:45,380
And then at a certain moment she says I took Nat-m.

139
00:17:48,948 --> 00:17:52,544
It’s not possible to reconstruct exactly the situation.

140
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:56,384
But more or less this is what I understand.

141
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:05,344
If she takes Nat-m. here that means that she took it because she had some grief.

142
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:12,770
How many years ago?
– 10 years.

143
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:24,026
– So, he is 15 years ago, here is 10 years ago, there is grief.

144
00:18:24,788 --> 00:18:30,944
She takes Nat-m. and helps her with her psychological state.

145
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,266
You repeated Nat-m.?
– I think so.

146
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:47,584
- And then...
- Suddenly the pains started with my old operated knee, it was the first pain,

147
00:18:47,828 --> 00:18:57,060
and every month there was another bone was getting more like that, on the feet and everywhere.

148
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:10,370
– When did you take Puls.?
– Maybe at this time. And then bones went better.

149
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:14,210
– With Puls.?
– Yes, I think so, it was better.

150
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:20,346
– And the pains? –
They were much better.

151
00:19:20,864 --> 00:19:24,948
– And the knee? – Also,
it was getting better.

152
00:19:26,746 --> 00:19:30,850
–Why did you have to have the knee operated?
– It was too bad.

153
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:40,064
The meniscus was broken again, there was a little piece in the knee and the tried to take that off.

154
00:19:40,308 --> 00:19:42,825
Of course, I couldn’t move my knee anymore.

155
00:19:46,424 --> 00:19:52,549
And I also had a bit the fear of my son...

156
00:19:55,894 --> 00:20:02,025
- During this time you developed fear of what?
– Fear that my son would die.

157
00:20:02,294 --> 00:20:05,868
He had a big accident and also I had a lot of fear

158
00:20:06,137 --> 00:20:11,998
that I would move to the new place where I live now.

159
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:19,945
I thought this is not the right place to stay for me.

160
00:20:20,468 --> 00:20:21,989
I gave up all my life before;

161
00:20:23,028 --> 00:20:27,109
where I lived, I had enough money, I could do want I wanted.

162
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:35,305
Now my hands were bounded and so I think this was because I couldn’t step away.

163
00:20:36,344 --> 00:20:38,867
The symbol was that also my feet got swollen

164
00:20:39,139 --> 00:20:42,707
 and me knee was getting swollen, of course, because of the grief.

165
00:20:42,979 --> 00:20:47,052
When you feel you can’t do anything I think this happened to the rheumatism,

166
00:20:47,308 --> 00:20:50,423
and it was coming more and more.

167
00:20:50,424 --> 00:20:58,345
The doctor told me if you would not take methotrexate, in a few months you will sit in a wheelchair.

168
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:01,669
– You took methotrexate?
– No. I didn’t, never.

169
00:21:02,185 --> 00:21:03,465
– Did you take cortisone?
– No.

170
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:06,548
– Aspirins?
– Yes.

171
00:21:08,344 --> 00:21:13,974
– How many aspirins?
– Not many but sometimes when there was pain.

172
00:21:14,469 --> 00:21:18,825
– Lach. helped you with the thyroid? Was it swollen?

173
00:21:19,589 --> 00:21:23,170
– I had pain and I couldn’t handle anything on my throat

174
00:21:23,424 --> 00:21:27,926
and also I think the doctor gave it because of the inflammation.

175
00:21:28,026 --> 00:21:34,265
It was red and swollen. It helped a lot.

176
00:21:34,506 --> 00:21:37,335
– Do you remember other remedies that helped you?

177
00:21:37,584 --> 00:21:43,984
You too Nux-v.; no effect. Med. had negative effect.

178
00:21:45,785 --> 00:21:57,984
Between I had a bad migraine and he gave me Nux-v.

179
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,690
Only because of the migraine.

180
00:22:15,386 --> 00:22:27,170
– The problem in this case is that we don’t know the theory well.

181
00:22:29,466 --> 00:22:33,697
And that’s why we arrive at a stage where wrongly

182
00:22:33,948 --> 00:22:41,747
or may directly may arrive by accident to the right state.

183
00:22:41,748 --> 00:22:46,868
Because you prescribe remedies one after another according to the symptomatology a person has.

184
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:52,260
You prescribe a remedy and then you give another one and then another

185
00:22:52,506 --> 00:22:57,108
and then the right one and then the wrong one and then the right and then the wrong...

186
00:22:58,906 --> 00:23:00,948
you go ahead like this.

187
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:11,460
The fact remains that at every time you have to make an evaluation of the situation of the patient.

188
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:16,064
And unless you know the theory you cannot make this evaluation.

189
00:23:16,826 --> 00:23:18,868
Your evaluation is going to be wrong.

190
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,708
The moment that your evaluation is going to be wrong you don’t know what to do next.

191
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:28,100
Will you give a remedy or not? Here you have an immediate problem.

192
00:23:28,346 --> 00:23:32,948
She’s suffering a lot. Are you going to give a remedy or not?

193
00:23:34,228 --> 00:23:39,348
At any moment you are facing this. Where did she have the grief?

194
00:23:39,866 --> 00:23:46,266
She took Nat-m. The grief was better. She took Puls. for the grief and she developed some fears.

195
00:23:46,784 --> 00:23:51,650
The fears was a positive or a negative reaction after Puls.?

196
00:23:52,148 --> 00:23:59,828
Puls. helped her swelling and brought out some fears.

197
00:24:02,388 --> 00:24:14,690
Is this right or wrong reaction? Who says it is wrong? 17.

198
00:24:15,188 --> 00:24:22,986
Who says it was right? 4.

199
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:32,708
Puls. helped her psychologically but brought out some fears.

200
00:24:32,975 --> 00:24:35,786
And my question is you hear this from your patient,

201
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:40,545
are you going to say I have made a mistake I gave a remedy

202
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:47,205
which made better the swelling but brought out some fears?

203
00:24:47,306 --> 00:24:51,908
Or are you going to say nice, good it’s correct?

204
00:24:56,505 --> 00:25:10,346
– Would it depend in balance the fears are more but the pains are less, in general?

205
00:25:12,655 --> 00:25:17,861
She got some fears how serious are they and how good is the pain relieved?

206
00:25:21,947 --> 00:25:29,104
– But if the fears were hidden deep inside of her as you said in another example

207
00:25:29,381 --> 00:25:33,985
and now they are coming out it would be good, it would be a progress.

208
00:25:35,504 --> 00:25:37,571
– But you have to know; is it good or bad?

209
00:25:39,344 --> 00:25:47,811
And you have to have some rules according to which you evaluate.

210
00:25:48,304 --> 00:25:53,701
If you don’t know the rules, if you don’t understand the rules then you cannot evaluate.

211
00:25:55,227 --> 00:26:02,145
You can say Puls. is wrong, antidote Puls. Or Puls. is correct and...

212
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:08,707
- So fears instead of swelling is wrong? It’s going to the emotional sphere, deeper.

213
00:26:09,987 --> 00:26:11,267
It cannot be the right remedy.

214
00:26:11,785 --> 00:26:19,214
– That’s correct. The fears are not good when the swelling is better.

215
00:26:19,727 --> 00:26:22,787
But is that all that you are evaluating?

216
00:26:28,425 --> 00:26:31,504
– In the beginning there was depression in Nat-m.

217
00:26:33,027 --> 00:26:35,064
And I think it’s good that brought out fear.

218
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:39,427
– That is correct. What she says is the correct evaluation.

219
00:26:39,694 --> 00:26:45,584
If there was a depression and swelling.

220
00:26:47,374 --> 00:26:50,424
Because she lost her husband and lost her children. She has depression.

221
00:26:50,704 --> 00:26:55,544
She takes Nat-m. and the depression is better,

222
00:26:55,824 --> 00:27:00,666
then she takes Puls. some fears are developing but the swelling is better

223
00:27:00,941 --> 00:27:04,264
and the depression is better but now she has the fears.

224
00:27:04,265 --> 00:27:09,134
The evaluation is that the remedy is correct.

225
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:21,424
But in order to do that you have really to know exactly what is happening.

226
00:27:21,934 --> 00:27:25,774
How much depression? What kind of depression? How deep?

227
00:27:27,544 --> 00:27:39,064
To be able to really evaluate what the remedy is doing and always the idea is that from this 3 levels

228
00:27:39,344 --> 00:27:47,024
(mental, emotional and physical) you try to see this direction;

229
00:27:47,267 --> 00:27:51,107
from the mental to emotional, from emotional to physical.

230
00:27:51,625 --> 00:27:56,227
And from the upper emotional going down to emotional.

231
00:27:58,787 --> 00:28:02,104
And this is how you can really evaluate the case.

232
00:28:02,384 --> 00:28:10,426
Now, in her particular case she says 3 days ago she took Rhus-t.

233
00:28:10,701 --> 00:28:18,896
and when she took it in the past several times it never worked.

234
00:28:19,661 --> 00:28:25,024
– No. Only the first time when I had lumbago by the windsurfing.

235
00:28:28,107 --> 00:28:32,976
– Now, 3 days before, you took Rhus-t. Did it have any effect?

236
00:28:33,227 --> 00:28:37,306
– I think new swellings came up that I never had before,

237
00:28:40,907 --> 00:28:45,504
much pain and suddenly, until this night,

238
00:28:46,027 --> 00:28:49,867
I couldn’t use my fingers anymore without pain.

239
00:28:50,106 --> 00:28:54,221
For 3 days I had much pain now the pain is gone.

240
00:28:54,464 --> 00:28:57,655
My knee is ok and now I have this pain.

241
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:02,506
What is your evaluation?

242
00:29:03,265 --> 00:29:05,584
What are you going to do? Are you going to repeat Rhus-t.?

243
00:29:10,455 --> 00:29:14,544
– I think it was the effect of Rhus-t. that I am sitting here like that.

244
00:29:24,266 --> 00:29:28,624
– With Homeopathy you have to know certain things;

245
00:29:28,865 --> 00:29:35,265
diseases don’t go just like this without any problem.

246
00:29:35,265 --> 00:29:38,864
You just give the remedy and the disease disappears. No.

247
00:29:39,385 --> 00:29:46,026
You have a process and you have to know whether the process is the correct one

248
00:29:47,306 --> 00:29:51,415
in order not to interfere in the wrong way and the wrong time,

249
00:29:52,944 --> 00:29:58,506
in order to let the remedy do whatever it can and then evaluate

250
00:29:58,775 --> 00:30:03,945
and decide whether if you should enter with another remedy.

251
00:30:03,946 --> 00:30:09,066
I will reveal to you something that I have never said before.

252
00:30:22,384 --> 00:30:33,145
I spoke about energy complexes which are mental, emotional and physical.

253
00:30:36,464 --> 00:30:42,615
Also you must know and you must have the experience that you give a remedy

254
00:30:43,105 --> 00:30:45,986
and the person comes back and says I am feeling better

255
00:30:46,086 --> 00:30:53,624
 emotionally, mentally, physically I am the same.

256
00:30:53,625 --> 00:31:01,305
The main problem may be the same but the person comes back and says I feel better in my emotions.

257
00:31:03,344 --> 00:31:11,545
What I am going to reveal you that this energy complexes here which are disturbed

258
00:31:15,105 --> 00:31:24,304
when you give a remedy that fits only a partial part of the human being

259
00:31:24,827 --> 00:31:28,144
which is either the mental or the emotional or physical,

260
00:31:29,701 --> 00:31:33,905
it can happen a rearrangement on this level

261
00:31:36,465 --> 00:31:46,466
that takes place a balance in this level and yet the whole organism is not touched.

262
00:31:48,772 --> 00:31:58,225
Do you understand now why some of your patients they come back after you give Nat-m.

263
00:31:59,012 --> 00:32:10,786
and they will usually say I feel better but my ulcer, my knees, my pains, my headaches, no change.

264
00:32:11,297 --> 00:32:20,787
Because what you have done is you choose a remedy which fits this energy complex which we call mental

265
00:32:21,303 --> 00:32:26,148
or the emotional or the physical.

266
00:32:26,938 --> 00:32:36,147
In the same way you give somebody a remedy for his knee, for his pain in the knee.

267
00:32:36,664 --> 00:32:45,108
It touches the knee pain, it cures the new pain but affects nothing on the whole organism.

268
00:32:45,349 --> 00:32:56,628
That means you choose a remedy which fits only the physical complex, not the whole organism.

269
00:32:57,144 --> 00:33:05,334
When you choose a remedy which fits really fits, is the similimum for the whole organism,

270
00:33:05,588 --> 00:33:09,428
then you have a different type of reaction.

271
00:33:10,949 --> 00:33:18,388
That’s why we don’t like to hear after we give a remedy “I am better”.

272
00:33:23,254 --> 00:33:33,748
What we like to hear is that your remedy made me very sick. The sicker the better.

273
00:33:34,505 --> 00:33:39,576
That means you have really touched the energy complex,

274
00:33:40,346 --> 00:33:46,992
which is behind these complexes which are partial.

275
00:33:48,545 --> 00:33:50,587
You really touch the similimum.

276
00:33:52,908 --> 00:34:02,107
And then the organism is shaken and tries to rearrange itself in all levels.

277
00:34:02,892 --> 00:34:10,572
But in so doing then what you will see is this kind of direction.

278
00:34:12,347 --> 00:34:14,412
Not I am better here, I am better there...

279
00:34:17,742 --> 00:34:26,467
You will see an initial aggravation which can be bigger or smaller,

280
00:34:26,706 --> 00:34:31,307
depending on the complexity of the case.

281
00:34:31,308 --> 00:34:33,612
How deep is the chronic case.

282
00:34:41,025 --> 00:34:51,022
In such case you may need to have to wait and see the effect of such prescription.

283
00:34:51,532 --> 00:34:58,907
You may have to wait for a month or two or six to see the effect of your prescription

284
00:35:00,451 --> 00:35:03,781
before you can even think of giving another remedy.

285
00:35:11,971 --> 00:35:19,905
Is it possible that in every case we’ll have this big reaction?

286
00:35:20,144 --> 00:35:22,704
No, it’s not possible, unfortunately.

287
00:35:28,101 --> 00:35:33,626
Those who know more about the theory that we teach here about the 12 levels of health, the groups etc.

288
00:35:34,626 --> 00:35:37,906
depending which group the patient belongs,

289
00:35:38,122 --> 00:35:44,551
 depending on that group that he will have this or that reaction.

290
00:35:48,706 --> 00:35:55,386
Here we have this case which gives us this feedback.

291
00:35:55,627 --> 00:36:07,665
3 days ago she took Rhus-t. 200C and she said all these years I never had it.

292
00:36:07,906 --> 00:36:14,586
I took Rhus-t. not any effect. Now you had an effect.

293
00:36:15,866 --> 00:36:18,146
– I think so.

294
00:36:25,067 --> 00:36:28,984
- What are we going to do? She is in pain.

295
00:36:30,544 --> 00:36:37,454
 Are we going to repeat Rhus-t. because it has an effect?

296
00:36:44,867 --> 00:36:50,904
What you have to ask in order to investigate a case is

297
00:36:51,427 --> 00:37:00,111
how Rhus-t. has affected her mentally and emotionally.

298
00:37:00,626 --> 00:37:10,223
Is any type of effect on these levels? What can you say?

299
00:37:10,733 --> 00:37:18,664
– I don’t know, maybe it’s because of the pain that I am feeling worse or confused.

300
00:37:18,908 --> 00:37:26,309
Every time, every year when I come here to find a little bit power

301
00:37:26,584 --> 00:37:32,987
and to relax a bit I know every time when I go home, it’s going better.

302
00:37:32,988 --> 00:37:36,549
On another point my best girlfriend is with me here on the island

303
00:37:37,334 --> 00:37:43,224
and she is in the same situation like I was when I was here for the first time,

304
00:37:46,025 --> 00:37:51,414
cause she wants to get a divorce and she has no power,

305
00:37:51,668 --> 00:37:54,665
she is very depressed and a lot of time we are talking

306
00:37:55,188 --> 00:38:08,505
and I think all my inner things will go out because of her.

307
00:38:09,028 --> 00:38:13,135
– Because of her situation.
 – Because I have been in the same situation 10 years before, maybe.

308
00:38:13,386 --> 00:38:23,108
– You understand her situation and you are affected by it.

309
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:29,775
– Yes, maybe. I am the only friend that can help her. She has no friends anymore.

310
00:38:30,026 --> 00:38:35,385
Her husband was so bad to everybody that she has no friends anymore.

311
00:38:37,706 --> 00:38:45,386
And all these come together so my suitcase is too heavy.

312
00:38:50,506 --> 00:38:54,585
I think all the things are coming together now.

313
00:39:00,495 --> 00:39:02,124
– You have to ask these questions,

314
00:39:02,224 --> 00:39:06,894
what I am asking is something you have to think and you have to ask.

315
00:39:06,895 --> 00:39:11,707
She says after Rhus-t. all my pains which I had here

316
00:39:11,971 --> 00:39:17,345
which were severe disappeared and now I have this pain.

317
00:39:18,225 --> 00:39:25,264
You have to ask whether this pain here is a better

318
00:39:25,541 --> 00:39:35,544
 or a worse situation than having the pains in the extremities.

319
00:39:35,545 --> 00:39:46,545
Is this pain a deeper or a more peripheral pain?

320
00:39:55,256 --> 00:40:06,507
If it is a deeper side that means from the peripheral joints it goes into a deeper joint,

321
00:40:06,776 --> 00:40:29,547
is this a good sign? No, it’s not a good sign. What did Rhus-t. do?

322
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:34,426
It suppressed from here to there.

323
00:40:44,666 --> 00:40:49,786
– If this woman’s joints are another kind of problem

324
00:40:50,296 --> 00:41:02,092
then the backache which is caused by external wind I think it is more superficial plane.

325
00:41:02,587 --> 00:41:05,665
– That is correct. You have to ask that.

326
00:41:06,188 --> 00:41:15,905
You have to ask whether what she is having here is because of riding a bike and she got a draft.

327
00:41:16,942 --> 00:41:21,025
She says I was riding a bike and I got a draft.

328
00:41:21,787 --> 00:41:32,547
So the question is, is this a continuation of the rheumatoid arthritis situation

329
00:41:32,814 --> 00:41:43,052
where from here it goes there, no good, or is this something else,

330
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:51,745
an acute situation which came either because she lifted some weight

331
00:41:52,012 --> 00:42:00,027
or because she was exposed to a draft or because she made a wrong move on the bike.

332
00:42:02,064 --> 00:42:07,461
If it is a continuation it’s not good.

333
00:42:07,971 --> 00:42:14,371
That means Rhus-t. has suppressed and it can do that.

334
00:42:16,144 --> 00:42:28,451
But is this really suppression or might be that this is a next situation not so deep?

335
00:42:34,587 --> 00:42:41,505
– What you said, the susceptibility to get a draft causing such a deep pain wasn’t there before

336
00:42:42,021 --> 00:42:46,107
and it’s a part of the progression of the arthritis condition.

337
00:42:55,585 --> 00:43:05,825
– There is one more question here. She said I started with this pain.

338
00:43:09,147 --> 00:43:14,021
Do we really have a suppression or we have a return of an old symptom?

339
00:43:17,091 --> 00:43:20,931
Because she says I started with this pain.

340
00:43:22,211 --> 00:43:25,025
– I think 2 days ago.

341
00:43:28,611 --> 00:43:34,224
Sometimes you have a feeling that there is something that disturbs you,

342
00:43:34,501 --> 00:43:39,382
I was feeling there was a little bit but I forgot it and now suddenly

343
00:43:39,628 --> 00:43:47,810
since this morning when I stood up it was starting so much.

344
00:43:47,811 --> 00:43:52,931
When I remember I think it was since that time when I took Rhus-t.

345
00:43:53,185 --> 00:44:00,101
A little bit only a shine I think it was there. But now it’s acute.

346
00:44:00,347 --> 00:44:05,985
I think it’s not only about the motorbike and the wind. I had something here that could be.

347
00:44:07,781 --> 00:44:11,867
Maybe a little bit but I think it’s not the only reason.

348
00:44:23,387 --> 00:44:31,331
– If this pain, which she has now, is a return of her old symptoms due to Rhus-t.

349
00:44:32,611 --> 00:44:35,664
you should wait, you should not touch the case.

350
00:44:37,221 --> 00:44:48,741
If this is a super imposition upon her organism of a new situation because of draft

351
00:44:49,251 --> 00:44:56,421
or because or wrong moves you can give a remedy.

352
00:45:06,296 --> 00:45:11,906
All these are the thoughts which are going on in my mind concerning the case.

353
00:45:12,945 --> 00:45:19,866
– In the beginning didn’t she say it was exactly the same way as it was 15 years before?

354
00:45:20,625 --> 00:45:25,496
She said first the joints and after that the back.

355
00:45:26,507 --> 00:45:34,188
– First it was the back and then the joints. Is this correct?
– Yes.

356
00:45:36,748 --> 00:45:39,062
– This is what is going on in my mind,

357
00:45:39,308 --> 00:45:43,666
all these questions which I put forward when I am examining the case.

358
00:45:49,265 --> 00:45:51,332
– One question;

359
00:45:51,586 --> 00:45:58,344
do we have to observe the conventional medicine you’ve got during the operation at the knee?

360
00:45:58,863 --> 00:46:00,904
– What medicine she took?

361
00:46:01,148 --> 00:46:09,864
– Yes and can this change the effect of the homeopathic remedies?

362
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:22,908
– What remedies did you take after the operation?
– Nothing. I only took Arn. by myself.

363
00:46:27,023 --> 00:46:31,868
– No painkillers, no chemical drugs, only Arn.

364
00:46:32,653 --> 00:46:41,613
– During the operation she must have taken narcotics for example or perhaps antibiotics.

365
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:47,228
– But don’t forget the operation was several years ago.

366
00:46:47,746 --> 00:46:54,413
– And this doesn’t change the effect of homeopathic remedies?

367
00:46:54,908 --> 00:47:01,826
– After the operation she took several remedies, she took Lyc. again, Puls.

368
00:47:02,093 --> 00:47:08,226
– The second operation was 3 years ago.

369
00:47:08,493 --> 00:47:15,388
The first time was when I was 20, more than 24 years ago,

370
00:47:15,663 --> 00:47:21,026
the second was 3 years ago and they told me in 3 weeks you can walk

371
00:47:21,293 --> 00:47:26,664
and you will never feel pain and after 5 months I could only walk in steps.

372
00:47:26,908 --> 00:47:29,743
Such a pain I had in my knee, I was not better.

373
00:47:31,023 --> 00:47:36,386
– So you took remedies?
– Only Arn. and then nothing.

374
00:47:39,213 --> 00:47:40,744
– And then you could not walk.

375
00:47:40,988 --> 00:47:51,503
– No, but I took ice or heat sometimes but no normal remedies not aspirin, nothing.

376
00:47:52,013 --> 00:47:53,544
– But homeopathic remedies?

377
00:47:54,063 --> 00:48:03,023
– Arn. I remember, I think first I took Nux-v. after the narcotics and then Arn.

378
00:48:03,266 --> 00:48:08,386
and then nothing. Sil. one time I think.

379
00:48:10,946 --> 00:48:12,988
Of course inflammation was not going off.

380
00:48:13,506 --> 00:48:18,108
I had such a knee over a month.

381
00:48:23,228 --> 00:48:25,788
– How are you going to think about this case?

382
00:48:26,063 --> 00:48:32,463
Because these are the cases that you are going to face in your practice.

383
00:48:39,868 --> 00:48:49,103
We clear up in our mind and we say either it is a suppression or maybe it is a curative action.

384
00:48:50,626 --> 00:48:55,746
Then can we do anything else?

385
00:49:04,188 --> 00:49:10,863
– I think up to this time she has taken all that remedies just for the symptoms, nothing else.

386
00:49:11,106 --> 00:49:22,108
But this time it’s better to take the whole case from the beginning to do the right nemesis,

387
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:30,573
to think of all the symptoms because we are always talking about these local symptoms.

388
00:49:30,824 --> 00:49:35,426
That’s not enough to find the right remedy.

389
00:49:35,693 --> 00:49:38,253
For half an hour we are talking only for local symptoms.

390
00:49:39,023 --> 00:49:43,868
So we have to go to what you are telling mental and emotional, everything,

391
00:49:44,386 --> 00:49:50,024
the totality of the symptoms, what actually are these. It might be the only solution.

392
00:49:50,543 --> 00:49:54,893
We have to forget about all these remedies I don’t mind now if I retake the case.

393
00:49:55,388 --> 00:50:02,063
I have to think about what happened exactly; that might be important for me.

394
00:50:04,866 --> 00:50:08,973
– That’s correct. What he says is correct.

395
00:50:10,504 --> 00:50:15,624
We reached that point where we have all these symptoms and the history

396
00:50:15,868 --> 00:50:22,024
and the remedies and the effects of the remedies but actually we don’t know the present situation,

397
00:50:22,543 --> 00:50:31,228
so the question is, if we take a full case at the moment we ask mental, emotional, physical symptoms

398
00:50:32,264 --> 00:50:42,748
can we then prescribe a remedy yes or no? Who says no? Who says yes?

399
00:50:48,386 --> 00:50:59,937
My answer is yes and no. Yes if we really see a clear picture now.

400
00:51:00,452 --> 00:51:07,345
If we have a clear picture of a remedy now we are allowed actually to prescribe.

401
00:51:07,617 --> 00:51:16,305
If we don’t see a clear picture we better wait. So this is the right answer.

402
00:51:23,492 --> 00:51:31,937
You ask the question, give to make the interrogation that you would like to know about her.

403
00:51:32,706 --> 00:51:34,497
– It’s not to make the right question.

404
00:51:39,106 --> 00:51:41,905
Is to restart and find out what is the purpose of her visit.

405
00:51:42,177 --> 00:51:50,865
– The purpose of the visit is the pain which is in the sacroiliac junction on the right side.

406
00:51:52,145 --> 00:51:56,772
We have several remedies like Aesc., Nat-p., Thuja.

407
00:51:57,026 --> 00:52:06,225
We have remedies of this or that type for sacroiliac junction but this is not good enough.

408
00:52:08,546 --> 00:52:14,428
– You have to think of all the remedies to see what remedy could be after these physical pains.

409
00:52:14,692 --> 00:52:21,346
– So you are going to ask, this is your patient and you are going to put the first question to her.

410
00:52:21,585 --> 00:52:25,186
– I believe she is stressed to talk only about these things, the physical problems,

411
00:52:25,425 --> 00:52:33,105
I maybe start with some modalities how it happened and how she is getting worse or something.

412
00:52:33,628 --> 00:52:36,945
And to come back slowly to the mental state.

413
00:52:37,468 --> 00:52:45,148
– Modalities of the pain. She can give us the modalities of the pain. She gave already.

414
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:54,372
When she is moving a little bit from the sitting position... there is motion aggravates.

415
00:52:54,865 --> 00:53:00,257
One modality but if she walks she is better.

416
00:53:01,788 --> 00:53:10,748
Another modality she gave is that warm ameliorates but local cold also ameliorates.

417
00:53:11,505 --> 00:53:15,984
Very cold and very warm both ameliorates.

418
00:53:16,507 --> 00:53:22,145
– These are strange symptoms that should be collected.

419
00:53:22,384 --> 00:53:25,985
– You ask her what else you want to know.

420
00:53:26,224 --> 00:53:33,411
– For example she told that first motion is aggravating, when she walks, the later motion is ameliorating.

421
00:53:33,904 --> 00:53:41,091
It might be right to note down and after we have to listen how she says.

422
00:53:42,625 --> 00:53:50,544
– She already said it. Say it again, how you feel the pain. The modality.

423
00:53:51,585 --> 00:54:00,027
– When I am beginning to move it is very painful, I cannot sit very still,

424
00:54:00,545 --> 00:54:06,181
I have to move a little bit but when I move in the beginning it’s very painful

425
00:54:06,427 --> 00:54:11,811
and when I am walking slowly it’s ok and when I am walking all is ok.

426
00:54:12,065 --> 00:54:20,507
When I stop and I start again the pains starts again.

427
00:54:21,816 --> 00:54:26,936
– The first motions aggravating and later she is ameliorating.
 – Next question.

428
00:54:27,185 --> 00:54:32,065
– How is the modality when you feel cold air or something?

429
00:54:32,588 --> 00:54:38,222
She told about the draft of the air, but how it happens can you explain?

430
00:54:40,012 --> 00:54:42,572
– With the motorbike!

431
00:54:42,828 --> 00:54:47,948
– How do you explain how you feel better with cold or warm.

432
00:54:48,187 --> 00:54:50,252
– I am feeling very hot in my face I think.

433
00:54:50,508 --> 00:54:55,628
– Flashes of heat you have?
– Cold hands and hot face.

434
00:54:55,867 --> 00:55:01,262
– So it is very important thing to know that the face is very hot and the feet are cold.

435
00:55:01,505 --> 00:55:07,662
– My feet are also cold. But I never had it since months.

436
00:55:14,572 --> 00:55:20,187
– What do you want to do when you want to relax your pain?

437
00:55:23,532 --> 00:55:30,227
– I go for swimming and I don’t know if I want to lie down on a bed.

438
00:55:30,468 --> 00:55:33,818
I think I prefer to walk more.

439
00:55:34,824 --> 00:55:39,945
– So it is reconfirming that the motion is ameliorating.
– So, what else?

440
00:55:42,264 --> 00:55:48,986
– What is your internal situation when you are in the house?
– Here on the island?

441
00:55:49,261 --> 00:55:58,464
– No, in your house, inside, how do you feel? Your pains.
– I cannot tell.

442
00:56:00,267 --> 00:56:01,538
– Another question.

443
00:56:01,786 --> 00:56:04,107
– If she goes out of the house does she feel better?

444
00:56:04,107 --> 00:56:08,976
– I feel better when I am in the nature. Every time I am feeling better.

445
00:56:09,227 --> 00:56:16,907
– So this modality I think it is clearer that she wants open air, open air is ameliorating as she confirmed it.

446
00:56:20,496 --> 00:56:24,064
– I think fresh air coming is better.

447
00:56:26,106 --> 00:56:33,024
– I think there are other doctors that maybe want to go on.

448
00:56:34,576 --> 00:56:39,181
– Can you describe your very inner state?

449
00:56:50,944 --> 00:56:54,266
– When I am in pain I cannot think of mental things now.

450
00:56:54,784 --> 00:56:59,386
– How do you feel beside of the pain? Emotional?

451
00:56:59,904 --> 00:57:11,424
– Calm not aggressive or something. I only feel the pain now.

452
00:57:11,947 --> 00:57:16,026
– How did you feel before it started?

453
00:57:18,347 --> 00:57:29,101
– I think lucky to see the nature around and to have no problems. I thought all was going well.

454
00:57:29,344 --> 00:57:34,221
– You were happy.
– Yes, really. Every time I am here I feel happy.

455
00:57:36,016 --> 00:57:39,066
– You were happy and talking with the girlfriend?
– Yes.

456
00:57:39,584 --> 00:57:43,696
– You described something else before.

457
00:57:43,947 --> 00:57:50,861
– This girlfriend has the same problems like I had when I came here to the island 10 years before.

458
00:57:51,376 --> 00:57:54,187
– And you were happy to hear this again?

459
00:57:57,261 --> 00:58:05,707
– No. I know her story for about 1 year. There is nothing that changed.

460
00:58:06,221 --> 00:58:14,906
And for me every time I have a lot of people I should help them, also mentally.

461
00:58:15,424 --> 00:58:21,824
It touches me but not so much, of course I’m a homeopath,

462
00:58:22,347 --> 00:58:23,265
every time I have people with problems

463
00:58:23,545 --> 00:58:32,335
and so it’s a normal problem like other peoples’ who are sitting there.

464
00:58:32,336 --> 00:58:38,736
Maybe it is going a little bit deeper but I think I am standing more over this.

465
00:58:39,226 --> 00:58:43,584
I think I have enough to do with myself and not only with the problems of my girlfriend.

466
00:58:43,856 --> 00:58:50,266
– I would like to mention 2 things outside of the interview;

467
00:58:51,546 --> 00:58:54,106
The one is the state of the class,

468
00:58:55,904 --> 00:59:04,346
it’s like confusing and the other point is she told us none of the remedies really helped her.

469
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:08,948
– No she said that Lyc. helped her quite a lot.

470
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:14,431
– But not totally. And Puls. helped her quite a lot

471
00:59:14,531 --> 00:59:22,529
but one sentence was no remedy helped really deeply. Isn’t it?

472
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:32,260
– Lyc. did very well and I had no pain and my bones were better,

473
00:59:33,024 --> 00:59:38,660
they got normal I think but suddenly I had new problems with my new husband,

474
00:59:38,906 --> 00:59:44,026
again the same things, I wanted to get off. But I couldn’t of course.

475
00:59:44,544 --> 00:59:47,795
I think this was also a point in December but I couldn’t because of the money

476
00:59:47,895 --> 00:59:51,544
 because of the situation with my children.

477
00:59:51,545 --> 00:59:58,945
I knew that I had to stay there for now on for 5 years maybe until they are grown enough

478
00:59:59,225 --> 01:00:02,026
and I will find another solution to all the things.

479
01:00:02,544 --> 01:00:10,224
Maybe I’ll stay there. I don’t know. But now it’s going normally I think at home.

480
01:00:12,266 --> 01:00:16,973
I think there is no family without problems.

481
01:00:17,986 --> 01:00:24,386
– Which aspect of your life you are not very happy with?

482
01:00:26,428 --> 01:00:43,853
– Who is happy? If you ask 95% of the cases will not answer positively

483
01:00:44,623 --> 01:00:54,344
because we always have an ideal of what might be the best position for us to be and we are not there.

484
01:00:54,588 --> 01:00:56,904
You ask her if she is happy.

485
01:00:57,423 --> 01:01:04,828
Unless she says I am depressed or I am anxious, suffers, otherwise... are you happy?

486
01:01:05,613 --> 01:01:11,228
– I would like to know at which areas she is having so much unhappiness.

487
01:01:11,503 --> 01:01:16,623
– What you can ask is; are you depressed?

488
01:01:20,706 --> 01:01:31,708
What is important for us is the changes that the patient himself notices concerning his own state.

489
01:01:32,226 --> 01:01:37,864
That means I was not feeling my iliac junction and now I have pain.

490
01:01:38,383 --> 01:01:48,104
This is a change definitely. I had no anxiety, now I have anxiety. That is a change.

491
01:01:48,623 --> 01:01:51,944
But if you ask a person are you anxious, no.

492
01:01:52,188 --> 01:01:52,706
Do you have fears? No.

493
01:01:52,973 --> 01:01:53,743
Are you depressed? No.

494
01:01:54,748 --> 01:02:01,305
You can keep on asking questions like that and the patient does not realize

495
01:02:01,552 --> 01:02:04,987
that there is such a change.

496
01:02:04,988 --> 01:02:12,943
You cannot force the patient to tell you really that maybe I am this or that.

497
01:02:13,453 --> 01:02:17,697
Because if you force at one moment you may get some positive answer

498
01:02:17,699 --> 01:02:23,182
on which you cannot base your prescription any more.

499
01:02:23,183 --> 01:02:28,303
Because it is not something which is given...

500
01:02:31,868 --> 01:02:43,906
- Is there any food that you strongly crave?
– Sea food.

501
01:02:47,746 --> 01:02:56,973
– Like?
– Lobsters or something like that. No oysters.

502
01:03:00,546 --> 01:03:05,666
– Sea food you mean fish?
– Yes. Fish and shrimps and all that.

503
01:03:07,708 --> 01:03:11,053
– Octopus?
– Yes, also.

504
01:03:11,823 --> 01:03:24,348
– And also sepias (cuttlefish)?
- Sep. I had also in between; I forgot it!

505
01:03:25,628 --> 01:03:37,423
– Any strong aversion for particular food; what do you strongly dislike?
– Oysters!

506
01:03:42,786 --> 01:03:46,383
– Which remedy has aversion to oysters?

507
01:03:47,388 --> 01:04:04,577
– Lyc. No! You don’t know your repertories! Aversion oysters, Kent gives only one remedy.

508
01:04:05,346 --> 01:04:22,268
Not Lach. Lach. has desire. It’s Phos. Phos. has aversion to oysters, strong

509
01:04:23,053 --> 01:04:32,225
 and Lach. has desire for oysters, strong.

510
01:04:32,226 --> 01:04:35,948
– Any food aggravations?
– No, I can only tell...

511
01:04:36,466 --> 01:04:38,508
- These are good questions.

512
01:04:38,777 --> 01:04:49,376
We can go ahead and ask her specific like do you take onions?
– Much. And garlic I prefer.

513
01:04:49,377 --> 01:04:50,908
– You like onions?
– Yes.

514
01:04:51,172 --> 01:04:57,572
– And no side effect. It doesn’t give you bloatedness or...

515
01:04:58,065 --> 01:05:01,505
- No. But I prefer garlic. I eat much garlic.

516
01:05:01,772 --> 01:05:08,576
If I can I eat 5-6 pieces a day, when I don’t have to work.

517
01:05:08,577 --> 01:05:11,906
Here in Greece it’s possible.

518
01:05:12,145 --> 01:05:16,508
– Sweets?
– Sometimes. More when I was younger.

519
01:05:16,772 --> 01:05:17,788
– Salt?
– No.

520
01:05:18,545 --> 01:05:21,628
– What about fatty food?

521
01:05:21,892 --> 01:05:28,653
– When I was younger I took fat meat and pork also but now

522
01:05:28,904 --> 01:05:37,103
 I don’t like any more fat on the meat or the pork.

523
01:05:37,346 --> 01:05:44,145
Of course when I eat pork I get more pain in my bones, every time.

524
01:05:50,545 --> 01:05:53,892
I prefer salads and fresh food.

525
01:06:00,028 --> 01:06:05,666
– What is your reaction to weather in general? Are you a cold person?

526
01:06:06,177 --> 01:06:14,865
– When the weather is changing to storm or to cold I feel it 1 or 2 days before.

527
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:22,545
I have a lot of pain in my bones. I am very stiff, I feel it in the morning when it’s raining.

528
01:06:22,817 --> 01:06:29,217
– That’s a good modality. Underline it 3 times.

529
01:06:29,732 --> 01:06:33,572
– Also when it gets hot. I feel it also the day before.

530
01:06:33,826 --> 01:06:44,305
– Somebody is asking are you weeping easily?
– Yes. Music also yes.

531
01:06:49,425 --> 01:06:53,725
When there are some memories and there is a lot of music that has been in my life

532
01:06:53,825 --> 01:07:00,188
and when I listen to special music...
- Which is the remedy that weeps with music?

533
01:07:00,452 --> 01:07:28,612
Nat-m. Graph. weeps with music. Nat-c., Aur.. They are affected by music.

534
01:07:28,866 --> 01:07:40,132
But when they say I weep with music the first remedy has to be Graph. Nat-c. is sensitive to music.

535
01:07:40,386 --> 01:07:45,506
Aur. is sensitive to music and Aur. is better with music.

536
01:07:47,297 --> 01:07:51,652
Depression, they put music... What kind of music?

537
01:07:52,668 --> 01:07:59,825
Classical music mostly, soft music. And their mood becomes lighter.

538
01:08:03,172 --> 01:08:11,868
But they may have a depression or anxiety

539
01:08:12,132 --> 01:08:20,577
or they may have a hurried feeling which is all the time inside

540
01:08:20,828 --> 01:08:24,417
and they put music and they eventually calm down.

541
01:08:24,668 --> 01:08:28,508
Which is the remedy? Everybody knows... Tarent.

542
01:08:32,097 --> 01:08:35,665
Very good! These are the modifications concerning music.

543
01:08:36,188 --> 01:08:42,588
– I remember the Tarent. case from the year before, not the last year, but the year before.

544
01:08:42,852 --> 01:08:46,692
I like spiders, yes! Much.

545
01:08:56,932 --> 01:09:03,586
– So what can you do more than that? We try to take the case.

546
01:09:23,025 --> 01:09:28,417
Kent says if any remedy benefit a patient in one potency,

547
01:09:28,668 --> 01:09:37,059
all the other potencies of that remedy will help the patient further on.

548
01:09:38,832 --> 01:09:45,508
He doesn’t say that exactly. What he says is this;

549
01:09:46,019 --> 01:09:56,505
when a remedy has helped, a potency has helped, you can try other potencies as well.

550
01:09:57,028 --> 01:10:05,988
Do not give up the remedy. But this doesn’t mean that if you try it will always help.

551
01:10:06,499 --> 01:10:11,619
He didn’t say that and it does not happen also.

552
01:10:12,112 --> 01:10:17,508
You may have a remedy helping in 200C and no other potency will help.

553
01:10:19,792 --> 01:10:26,788
But when you have a remedy which has helped and helped in general

554
01:10:27,027 --> 01:10:37,028
then you don’t give up this remedy before you have tried a higher potency or a lower potency.

555
01:10:38,308 --> 01:10:41,107
– Why not do that in this case?

556
01:10:42,148 --> 01:10:47,268
– Well we are thinking of that. We will see in the end what we will decide.

557
01:10:50,067 --> 01:10:56,184
Whether we should give another Rhus-t. higher.

558
01:11:01,065 --> 01:11:10,264
How is your sleep in general?
– Bad. I am dreaming a lot.

559
01:11:10,364 --> 01:11:15,528
– You talk in your sleep?
– Maybe. I don’t know.

560
01:11:15,939 --> 01:11:21,828
– Do you grind your teeth?
– No. But I am snoring bad since a few weeks.

561
01:11:23,619 --> 01:11:24,342
I had problems with the nose.

562
01:11:24,588 --> 01:11:31,157
 I think maybe I have a little hay fever but I don’t take a remedy for this.

563
01:11:31,257 --> 01:11:39,987
In Germany the last weeks was very hot. We had more than 30°C for 2 weeks and it was not normal.

564
01:11:40,259 --> 01:11:45,107
– Do you have any headaches now, during this period of time?
– Yes, I had.

565
01:11:45,379 --> 01:11:53,059
Suddenly I had when I drank one beer and on the next morning I had as if I had drunk a lot of beer.

566
01:11:54,585 --> 01:11:56,112
– Only one time?

567
01:11:58,179 --> 01:12:06,105
– Yes. But I remember the last year when I drank beer, I’ve had headache.

568
01:12:06,628 --> 01:12:13,267
I never had headache before. I can drink good wine and then I have no problems.

569
01:12:14,032 --> 01:12:19,152
I can drink a lot of wine but if I drink beer I have a headache.

570
01:12:26,067 --> 01:12:38,867
– Are you thirsty?
– Yes. The years before I wasn’t and since 2-3 weeks I am very thirsty.

571
01:12:39,632 --> 01:12:44,505
– For cold water or it doesn’t matter?
– Not very cold.

572
01:12:45,267 --> 01:12:50,148
– You are thirsty and you are drinking.
– I am drinking water if I get some.

573
01:12:50,387 --> 01:12:57,552
But sometimes I forget to drink. I am not drinking enough all over the day like necessary.

574
01:12:57,828 --> 01:13:04,739
– Do you feel frozen or sweaty?
– When I am tired I am very frozen.

575
01:13:13,188 --> 01:13:14,468
– But in general you are cold?

576
01:13:14,979 --> 01:13:30,832
– When I was younger I was colder but now the last 2-3 years I need to open the window

577
01:13:31,108 --> 01:13:37,508
and sometimes I am feeling very hot. Sometimes I have little feelings like fever.

578
01:13:41,859 --> 01:13:44,912
– You never took Calc.?

579
01:13:45,699 --> 01:13:59,779
– Maybe but it was long ago. Maybe 10 years ago. But I don’t prefer eggs.

580
01:14:00,272 --> 01:14:10,265
I like them but they’re not necessary. Sometimes I like to drink a lot of cold milk. Sometimes.

581
01:14:13,072 --> 01:14:18,979
– Lately do you like milk?
– Cold milk, yes.

582
01:14:28,185 --> 01:14:31,268
– Are you sweating on special parts on your body?

583
01:14:31,507 --> 01:14:36,627
– Yes, in the night. I had times when the bones are very bad.

584
01:14:36,899 --> 01:14:43,792
I was sweating all over my body; under the feet and mostly here, on the head and the shoulders.

585
01:14:44,307 --> 01:14:51,472
All was wet when I was waking up in the morning. I had it for months.

586
01:14:51,748 --> 01:14:58,148
Also in the winter when it was very cold outside and I was sweating.

587
01:14:59,152 --> 01:15:02,499
I was getting very hot,

588
01:15:05,305 --> 01:15:09,346
then I was throwing away the covers and suddenly I was frozen

589
01:15:09,626 --> 01:15:18,348
and shivering and it was changing all night long.
– Your feet are normally outside of the blanket?

590
01:15:19,628 --> 01:15:24,899
– Good question. I don’t know. Sometimes, yes.

591
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:33,987
 When I am sweating and I am hot I put the feet off the blanket.

592
01:15:33,988 --> 01:15:38,832
– Are your feet smelling of the sweat?
– No.

593
01:15:39,619 --> 01:15:44,739
– Are you sweating every night now for months?

594
01:15:44,985 --> 01:15:50,628
– I had about 1-2 years, I was sweating and couldn’t sleep all night.

595
01:15:50,867 --> 01:15:52,665
I also had problems to sleep;

596
01:15:53,945 --> 01:16:00,099
at 3 a.m. I used to wake but I am very sensitive to electricity

597
01:16:00,592 --> 01:16:11,108
and I know from the town where I live that at 3 a.m. they change the electric

598
01:16:15,952 --> 01:16:21,348
and about that time when they change it I wake up suddenly and I can’t sleep till they pull it down.

599
01:16:25,699 --> 01:16:36,432
I sleep again when it’s 6 a.m. It was a big problem for a long time.

600
01:16:37,219 --> 01:16:41,828
And now we put off every electric device in the bed

601
01:16:42,067 --> 01:16:50,825
but the problem is now we have a new mobile phone on top of the roof

602
01:16:51,064 --> 01:17:03,291
and there are 3 mobile antennas that are coming over my head.

603
01:17:03,588 --> 01:17:15,108
– Have you ever taken Tub.?
– Yes. The first time before I got Lyc. I had it long time ago.

604
01:17:15,347 --> 01:17:20,054
– And no effect?
– I think I was better.

605
01:17:21,334 --> 01:17:29,377
But the bad thing with my bones came out when the mental things happened.

606
01:17:29,378 --> 01:17:43,951
– Do you like cats, dogs?
- I like cats much. They come to me and every time I feed them.

607
01:17:44,738 --> 01:17:51,907
Dogs I like but I am a little bit afraid of dogs because I was bitten when I was a child.

608
01:17:53,698 --> 01:17:57,538
I accept them but I don’t like them.

609
01:17:58,031 --> 01:18:04,184
– Was there any time that you had a pre-tuberculous condition as a child?

610
01:18:04,946 --> 01:18:16,984
– I think my grandmother died of lung affection and in her family there was TB.

611
01:18:17,507 --> 01:18:27,986
And my mother got scabies when she was young, in the war.

612
01:18:28,751 --> 01:18:34,386
Psor. I think it was the remedy. Psor. was also the remedy for my second son.

613
01:18:38,991 --> 01:18:41,827
– Any dreams? Do you see persistent dreams?

614
01:18:46,066 --> 01:18:55,097
– A lot of times I am dreaming that I am looking for a street and I am missing a train that is waiting.

615
01:18:55,346 --> 01:19:00,982
I can see it but I can’t get it, I am too late and I get the wrong way to get there.

616
01:19:01,228 --> 01:19:06,617
This is what I dream a lot of times over years.

617
01:19:08,387 --> 01:19:09,454
– Once again please, very slowly.

618
01:19:09,944 --> 01:19:14,825
– There is a train and I want to get this train on the railway station

619
01:19:15,344 --> 01:19:20,707
and I want to get there and I am asking somebody for the way but it’s always the wrong way

620
01:19:20,974 --> 01:19:26,094
and I never get this train and the train is going and I have to wait or find another way.

621
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:31,787
This I dreamt a lot of times, also the last months.

622
01:19:34,868 --> 01:19:42,050
And if I am talking about something over the day with somebody I am dreaming it again in the night very often.

623
01:19:42,548 --> 01:19:47,940
And I can also feel or see that some things will happen. I feel it before.

624
01:19:49,730 --> 01:20:00,427
– You said the main symptom you have is pain currently. How does the pain make you feel?

625
01:20:00,696 --> 01:20:03,256
You have the pain, it has been worse the last 3 days.

626
01:20:03,505 --> 01:20:10,426
How do you feel when you have pain?
– Bad.

627
01:20:10,945 --> 01:20:16,332
– Can you just enlarge a little bit?
– Most probably you are English.

628
01:20:16,827 --> 01:20:24,012
– That’s right. How did you guess?
– That’s why we have problems understanding!

629
01:20:26,305 --> 01:20:38,092
– I am feeling sad, my energy is gone then, when the pain is coming I have no energy.

630
01:20:38,348 --> 01:20:42,188
It is very painful and also in the morning when I get up and I have pain.

631
01:20:42,702 --> 01:20:50,892
It needs a few hours until the pain goes and you can laugh or something like that.

632
01:20:51,148 --> 01:20:57,787
Also, I don’t like noises in the morning. I need a lot of time in the morning.

633
01:20:58,062 --> 01:21:03,948
– Are you ever bleeding without any reason? From the nose or somewhere?

634
01:21:04,187 --> 01:21:06,252
– When I was a child yes. A lot of times.

635
01:21:07,532 --> 01:21:12,142
– Nose bleed?
– Yes, very fast when I was 5-6 years old.

636
01:21:12,908 --> 01:21:19,268
– Bleeding while you are brushing teeth?

637
01:21:21,059 --> 01:21:28,228
– Sometimes, but when I put off the amalgam it stops.

638
01:21:33,859 --> 01:21:37,188
– How do you feel about travelling? Are you worse when travelling or better?

639
01:21:39,306 --> 01:21:44,185
– I am feeling much better. I think it’s Tub. I like to travel any time.

640
01:21:44,695 --> 01:21:47,745
I could travel all the time. Although there is pain.

641
01:21:48,025 --> 01:21:52,865
– Do you ever dream of doing work?

642
01:21:53,145 --> 01:21:58,775
– Yes, I am working very hard in my dreams and sometimes I feel that I have done it really when I wake up.

643
01:21:59,024 --> 01:22:06,455
I am so tired that I can wake up and feel as if I was working all night.

644
01:22:06,704 --> 01:22:09,505
– You didn’t get paid for it either!

645
01:22:17,185 --> 01:22:21,025
– You are working hard in your dreams; how about in real life? Are you a hard worker?

646
01:22:21,815 --> 01:22:25,655
– Yes, the last 10 years I have to work hard.

647
01:22:25,904 --> 01:22:28,985
– I have another question which is completely disconnected.

648
01:22:29,226 --> 01:22:37,905
Have you ever been anemic in your life? Feeling weak?
– No.

649
01:22:44,577 --> 01:22:49,667
– In former times, when you were without pain were you sometimes

650
01:22:49,934 --> 01:22:54,344
 in the center of attention of your friends?

651
01:22:54,345 --> 01:22:57,667
Were you laughing very often?
– Yes.

652
01:22:58,185 --> 01:23:05,347
– Not only listening but... - I am laughing a lot.

653
01:23:05,614 --> 01:23:14,574
When I am in group I like to laugh and not to discuss problems.

654
01:23:15,854 --> 01:23:19,945
– In former times before your period stopped, how was the period?

655
01:23:21,428 --> 01:23:25,587
– Very fast, very painful,

656
01:23:28,419 --> 01:23:32,752
a lot of blood and 3 times I had to go to the hospital to stop it.

657
01:23:33,267 --> 01:23:37,625
I got an operation, I was bleeding a lot when I was young.

658
01:23:38,148 --> 01:23:47,865
– Painful where? In abdomen or back?
– Uterus. It was like when you get a child.

659
01:23:48,388 --> 01:23:56,579
– Before the period or during the period?
– Before 1-2 days and during also.

660
01:24:08,864 --> 01:24:13,730
– You had this pain in the back 10 years ago?
– Maybe a little bit earlier yes.

661
01:24:14,228 --> 01:24:16,026
– And you took Rhus-t. then?
– Yes.

662
01:24:16,290 --> 01:24:18,340
– And nothing happened?
– It was getting better.

663
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:23,970
– You had an amelioration from the pain on the back from Rhus.-t?

664
01:24:23,970 --> 01:24:32,666
– The back was ok then but the problem with the fingers and the other bones started much later.

665
01:24:32,930 --> 01:24:36,506
– So Rhus.-t was curative originally?
– The first time yes.

666
01:24:47,586 --> 01:24:50,667
– And your mental emotional state?

667
01:24:50,936 --> 01:24:55,546
Were you in a bad mental emotional state at that time originally when you got the back pain?

668
01:24:55,787 --> 01:24:59,896
– Now?
– No, before. When it was there originally.

669
01:25:00,386 --> 01:25:03,226
– 15 years ago or now?

670
01:25:03,467 --> 01:25:07,307
– When the Rhus.t worked originally with the pain, your mental emotional state was...

671
01:25:07,576 --> 01:25:10,906
- It was ok. At this time I had no problems.

672
01:25:11,147 --> 01:25:16,785
– Also you have to remember, because we are looking for mental emotional

673
01:25:17,026 --> 01:25:26,776
that when somebody has this type of disease when it is strongly on the joints.

674
01:25:29,701 --> 01:25:36,865
Especially there’s rheumatoid arthritis will very seldom have mental emotional symptoms.

675
01:25:37,381 --> 01:25:39,941
The disease is on the physical body now.

676
01:25:40,187 --> 01:25:48,901
And it is not easy to find really strong mental or emotional symptoms.

677
01:25:49,147 --> 01:25:57,988
If we take the intensity of the pain, that fact that she is red in the face,

678
01:25:58,263 --> 01:26:05,427
hot in the face and cold in the extremities we can be thinking of Bell.

679
01:26:08,228 --> 01:26:19,429
But if we take that she is desiring cold milk

680
01:26:23,626 --> 01:26:27,705
and the predisposition we can be thinking of Tub.

681
01:26:28,746 --> 01:26:37,148
If we take the modalities

682
01:26:37,666 --> 01:26:45,857
which she has and the desire for cold milk we are thinking of Rhus-t.

683
01:26:47,652 --> 01:26:55,332
Also with Tub. is the extreme perspiration that she has during the night.

684
01:26:55,586 --> 01:27:01,468
So with the extreme perspiration and the coldness of the extremities we may be thinking of Calc.

685
01:27:05,572 --> 01:27:13,614
Because the thirst is increased quite strongly the last time

686
01:27:13,865 --> 01:27:18,864
we may be thinking of Bry. as a complimentary to Rhus-t.

687
01:27:18,865 --> 01:27:22,466
We know that Bry. compliments the action of Rhus-t.

688
01:27:22,705 --> 01:27:33,505
Actually through taking her case we come down to these remedies mostly

689
01:27:33,772 --> 01:27:38,316
and we may decide which one is the correct.

690
01:27:50,821 --> 01:28:01,187
For Phos. I would need at least to have the thirst with cold.

691
01:28:01,462 --> 01:28:05,302
At this moment there are no Phos. symptoms

692
01:28:05,548 --> 01:28:16,822
unless the thirst was really for very cold water which she did not confirm.

693
01:28:17,068 --> 01:28:32,185
- Calc-p... - There is a possibility especially because we heard her sigh a few times.

694
01:28:32,460 --> 01:28:35,535
She sighs from pain, of course.

695
01:28:42,191 --> 01:28:51,666
– Kali-c. because of the sweat during the night and the lumbago.

696
01:28:54,991 --> 01:29:03,951
– Kali-c. is not one of the remedies that perspire during the night so much to take it as a keynote.

697
01:29:03,951 --> 01:29:13,944
And this is not lumbago. This is really concentrating on right sacroiliac junction.

698
01:29:13,944 --> 01:29:17,784
An inflammation on sacroiliac junction.

699
01:29:26,744 --> 01:29:30,584
– Does the sweat she gets ameliorate the pains?

700
01:29:31,864 --> 01:29:37,746
– She cannot say because she just had the pain today.
– I am not sweating now.

701
01:29:38,062 --> 01:29:39,342
– Before?

702
01:29:42,145 --> 01:29:47,788
– Maybe when I am very wet in the morning the pains get better.

703
01:29:52,142 --> 01:29:58,178
– Anyone who will give one of these remedies is a good homeopath.

704
01:30:03,026 --> 01:30:04,824
Not good enough!

705
01:30:11,224 --> 01:30:18,576
The reason that because we are thinking of all these remedies as we analyzed before

706
01:30:19,584 --> 01:30:27,021
we said if the case becomes clear after we take the whole case then we can prescribe.

707
01:30:28,026 --> 01:30:30,861
The case according to this analysis is not clear.

708
01:30:31,104 --> 01:30:35,706
If we have all these possibilities that means the case is not clear.

709
01:30:37,261 --> 01:30:44,257
Therefore because we see between the remedies that they have a great possibility

710
01:30:44,772 --> 01:30:55,266
because of the desire for cold milk and the modalities Rhus-t. still is a possibility,

711
01:30:55,505 --> 01:31:02,862
the correct remedy to give at this moment is this;

712
01:31:10,785 --> 01:31:12,332
Placebo.

713
01:31:13,102 --> 01:31:21,548
If you want to give something to your patient, 3 days ago you had given Rhus-t. right or wrongly,

714
01:31:21,548 --> 01:31:28,187
then we have to wait to really see what is happening.

715
01:31:28,187 --> 01:31:34,587
Has Rhus-t. really suppressed the case or is going to promote the case?

716
01:31:34,862 --> 01:31:40,388
If it is the correct remedy

717
01:31:42,184 --> 01:31:52,183
she will within a few more days start feeling better in that junction as well.

718
01:32:00,378 --> 01:32:05,066
The problem is that the case is not clear

719
01:32:05,305 --> 01:32:15,306
therefore if we don’t want to confuse the case further we should wait.

720
01:32:15,545 --> 01:32:19,225
3 days ago you gave a remedy, there is a reaction,

721
01:32:21,028 --> 01:32:25,379
there is a possibility that an old symptom has come back

722
01:32:29,712 --> 01:32:34,832
and we don’t have a clear remedy, we have to wait.

723
01:32:39,374 --> 01:32:44,494
But where she points out the pain, the intensity of the pain also,

724
01:32:44,494 --> 01:32:49,104
shows definitely that there is an inflammation in the sacroiliac junction.

725
01:32:49,104 --> 01:32:53,705
But you can do a physical examination as well.

726
01:32:54,734 --> 01:33:01,134
Unfortunately from a purely homeopathic point of view you cannot give a remedy.

727
01:33:01,385 --> 01:33:09,827
What you can do to relieve the pain is use some aspirin.

728
01:33:10,821 --> 01:33:18,647
But this type of pain especially if it’s a return of the old symptom

729
01:33:18,747 --> 01:33:26,345
that means if the organism comes back to the beginning of the rheumatoid arthritis

730
01:33:26,364 --> 01:33:33,774
this type of pain is quite severe, quite obstinate, it’s not easily gone away

731
01:33:34,025 --> 01:33:40,944
and if you expect by a remedy to take out this pain within 24 hours

732
01:33:41,187 --> 01:33:46,574
you are going to make a mistake even if the case is quite clear.

733
01:33:46,825 --> 01:33:51,781
This type of pain with this type of disease is not going away easily.

734
01:33:52,027 --> 01:34:05,861
And if you want to reduce the pain, I can reduce the pain, by tomorrow she will feel 60% better.

735
01:34:09,701 --> 01:34:11,464
I’ll give all of them.

736
01:34:14,268 --> 01:34:20,668
If you just give 5 remedies by tomorrow, about 24 hours,

737
01:34:20,943 --> 01:34:25,026
a day after tomorrow she will feel 60% better but...

738
01:34:25,293 --> 01:34:37,826
Now there is a possibility that her state of health will become better.

739
01:34:38,093 --> 01:34:44,226
If you are careful, if you know what you are doing, what you expect,

740
01:34:44,226 --> 01:34:51,144
if you want to reduce the pain of course it is very easy, you just add Thuja to that,

741
01:34:57,293 --> 01:35:06,979
6 remedies and perhaps Aesc. also. 7.

742
01:35:11,588 --> 01:35:17,988
Homeopathy is like the people who are pure.

743
01:35:19,988 --> 01:35:24,854
The people who are pure don’t do anything wrong.

744
01:35:26,629 --> 01:35:37,144
But sometimes they are tempted to do some sins. You know what I mean.

745
01:35:43,269 --> 01:35:54,294
After that it does not matter whether 1,2,5,25 sins, then it goes like this.

746
01:35:54,294 --> 01:36:03,254
As long as you keep your purity you are on the right path.

747
01:36:03,254 --> 01:36:07,589
As long as you tempted to do this,

748
01:36:07,970 --> 01:36:19,744
to reduce the pain with 7 drugs then there is a kind of downward process

749
01:36:21,786 --> 01:36:28,622
The bottom is where all remedies lie. 780 is the M.M. of Boericke.

750
01:36:28,865 --> 01:36:33,570
which will take you right to the bottom. You can use all of them. That’s the bottom.

751
01:36:34,786 --> 01:36:43,505
If you reach that point, you will need all the remedies to relieve your patients.

752
01:36:46,065 --> 01:36:47,586
It’s the other way around.

753
01:36:47,586 --> 01:36:52,465
If you start with giving a lot of remedies and you start reducing the remedies

754
01:36:52,706 --> 01:36:58,865
the you may reach the point where really you understand what you are doing,

755
01:36:58,865 --> 01:37:07,066
you give a remedy, you observe, you evaluate, you wait and then you are satisfied with your case.

756
01:37:07,066 --> 01:37:16,267
I can tell you that. My experience shows it again and again; to make sin does not pay.

757
01:37:19,096 --> 01:37:26,307
Polypharmacy, poly-relationships...

758
01:37:29,657 --> 01:37:34,777
‘Poly’ means ‘much’ Greek.

759
01:37:37,827 --> 01:37:47,224
That’s why Greeks used to say stick always to the golden means,

760
01:37:53,106 --> 01:37:55,151
never too much.

761
01:37:56,707 --> 01:37:59,908
Homeopathy is exactly this.

762
01:38:02,984 --> 01:38:08,627
I feel that this case was very difficult for all of us.

763
01:38:09,658 --> 01:38:14,506
Me included. So nobody is happy, I can see in your eyes.

764
01:38:15,666 --> 01:38:21,186
There is a difference between a simple inflammation of the sacroiliac junction

765
01:38:25,293 --> 01:38:32,706
and a collagen disease which we call rheumatoid arthritis.

766
01:38:35,023 --> 01:38:48,184
Actually it is a whole syndrome which is has this junction involved which is very painful,

767
01:38:48,694 --> 01:38:56,106
very obstinate and not manageable with (manual) manipulation.

768
01:38:56,624 --> 01:39:02,426
Therefore in this particular case I will be very careful if somebody suggests

769
01:39:02,690 --> 01:39:10,092
 that I can promise  you she will be better...I would doubt it very much.

770
01:39:14,702 --> 01:39:20,065
I would also ask her if she wants to take aspirin.

771
01:39:22,107 --> 01:39:30,828
She can take aspirin to reduce the pain than giving 7 remedies to be able to bring about the least pain.

772
01:39:30,828 --> 01:39:37,467
I have found out that many times through the aggravation period

773
01:39:37,742 --> 01:39:45,666
which I consider 3 days is within the aggravation period I have found out if I explain to the patient

774
01:39:45,933 --> 01:39:50,468
this aggravation is because of the remedy

775
01:39:53,295 --> 01:39:56,545
then I see this aggression of the patient

776
01:39:56,796 --> 01:40:05,025
“you gave me this remedy and I am much worse”, I let them talk and then I say ok.

777
01:40:06,051 --> 01:40:10,907
This is what happens in Homeopathy; we have an initial aggravation, this is very good.

778
01:40:11,941 --> 01:40:21,665
They calm down immediately and they give you the time to observe because otherwise you lose your mind.

779
01:40:23,971 --> 01:40:30,625
Now she is not shouting but much more difficult cases they shout.

780
01:40:30,864 --> 01:40:35,227
– Especially being homeopath she is advising herself...

781
01:40:35,491 --> 01:40:39,585
- We have to have the time for observation. Now what shall we do?

782
01:40:39,824 --> 01:40:49,825
I don’t know. Because it’s too early after the remedy and the remedy has brought back an old symptom.

783
01:40:50,341 --> 01:40:55,461
Let’s see. Another remedy is not clear.

784
01:40:55,707 --> 01:41:00,304
That remedy also still has some indications.

785
01:41:01,091 --> 01:41:08,261
Maybe we have to go later on to go higher if we see that the pain continues.

786
01:41:11,067 --> 01:41:19,504
Maybe something will change. The most probable of these remedies are Rhus-t. and Tub.

787
01:41:19,781 --> 01:41:27,461
These are the 2 most probable remedies which may still be indicated or may still have to be repeated.

788
01:41:38,465 --> 01:41:43,822
– I think you are right but...

789
01:41:51,745 --> 01:41:55,067
she has severe pain.

790
01:41:55,342 --> 01:42:03,618
In Brazil there are colleagues who are very enthusiastic

791
01:42:05,391 --> 01:42:11,544
about associating acupuncture to relieve the pain.

792
01:42:12,067 --> 01:42:14,627
Which is your opinion about it?

793
01:42:22,031 --> 01:42:27,427
– This kind of pain is difficult to be relieved with acupuncture.

794
01:42:30,268 --> 01:42:40,264
And my experience is that acupuncture can also have a suppressive effect like Homeopathy.

795
01:42:43,853 --> 01:42:51,784
I just relate to you a case of high blood pressure with sleeplessness.

796
01:42:52,028 --> 01:43:06,383
I prescribed Calc. She came a month later I can’t remember, with a severe lumbago.

797
01:43:09,948 --> 01:43:16,866
The blood pressure was normal. She was sleeping well but now she had that lumbago.

798
01:43:17,132 --> 01:43:20,737
I took the case and I could see no clear remedy.

799
01:43:20,737 --> 01:43:31,746
I said I’m sorry I cannot give you a remedy you have to stay with your lumbago come again after a few days.

800
01:43:31,985 --> 01:43:45,057
he went to an acupuncturist; the lumbago was gone.

801
01:43:46,337 --> 01:43:56,305
In one week after the lumbago was gone the blood pressure shot up and she had a brain stroke.

802
01:43:59,652 --> 01:44:05,788
When she came back after the hospital, she told me the story, I said I am very sorry.

803
01:44:06,052 --> 01:44:12,706
You should have asked whether you should go to an acupuncturist

804
01:44:12,706 --> 01:44:18,337
but she decided herself because somebody said you do this.

805
01:44:18,588 --> 01:44:25,014
So we have to know quite well our pathology as homeopaths.

806
01:44:25,268 --> 01:44:33,705
We have to know the pathology and what the real prognosis of our case is.

807
01:44:33,974 --> 01:44:40,374
Her prognosis, according to my experience,

808
01:44:40,628 --> 01:44:46,774
is that she has to go through this inflammation for several weeks perhaps

809
01:44:48,549 --> 01:44:56,229
if this is a return of an old symptom where rheumatoid arthritis started with this place.

810
01:44:58,025 --> 01:45:01,865
But after that she can remain quite well.

811
01:45:02,388 --> 01:45:09,029
If we start interfering with this reaction of the organism either by homeopathic remedy

812
01:45:09,304 --> 01:45:16,214
or manual manipulation or acupuncture, in her case I will say...

813
01:45:19,785 --> 01:45:22,104
I don’t want to do that.

814
01:45:22,104 --> 01:45:25,025
I don’t want to touch this case.

815
01:45:28,375 --> 01:45:36,304
A simple severe sciatica, I prescribe a remedy and I see no effect.

816
01:45:36,545 --> 01:45:42,305
She will say can I go to acupuncturist I would say of course go to an acupuncturist.  She can try.

817
01:45:42,821 --> 01:45:46,908
But when we have a severe case where she has not sleep at night,

818
01:45:46,908 --> 01:45:51,225
she has high blood pressure and the anxiety was very high,

819
01:45:52,015 --> 01:45:57,625
I prescribed the remedy and I see all this calms down and the organism takes it on that level.

820
01:45:57,900 --> 01:46:02,255
I said thank God, that’s very good.

821
01:46:02,255 --> 01:46:06,585
I didn’t say to her it’s very good because the patient is suffering now.

822
01:46:06,585 --> 01:46:10,186
If you tell her it’s very good she will tell you thank you very much!

823
01:46:10,425 --> 01:46:19,908
You say now wait, come after a week and we’ll see if there is a clear picture

824
01:46:19,908 --> 01:46:27,340
but before you have a clear picture after such a good reaction it’s not good to give another remedy.

825
01:46:27,588 --> 01:46:34,506
This is my experience and I have several examples that show that

826
01:46:34,745 --> 01:46:42,425
because lots of cases have been spoiled with the homeopathic remedy afterwards.

827
01:46:42,700 --> 01:46:48,332
There is a correct reaction and then different remedies are given

828
01:46:48,588 --> 01:46:54,689
 and they spoil the reaction finally and then you say why.

829
01:46:55,748 --> 01:47:08,300
But as you said it is severe but you have to know this RA case where the sacroiliac junction is involved

830
01:47:08,815 --> 01:47:16,495
you are going to have a very severe case and you have to treat it very carefully if you want a cure.

831
01:47:27,748 --> 01:47:33,386
To give LM potency in this case? You can try that.

832
01:47:33,625 --> 01:47:38,745
That is the most innocent thing you can do.

833
01:47:43,375 --> 01:47:55,385
– May I ask you one question? Deep inside of you do you really think that this case is a Rhus-t. case?

834
01:47:56,426 --> 01:47:58,220
With all your experience?

835
01:47:59,500 --> 01:48:02,575
– I will tell you something my experience says.

836
01:48:02,828 --> 01:48:08,187
When I have seen a very clear case and I have given the remedy and did not work.

837
01:48:12,027 --> 01:48:17,932
Sometimes it looks very clear and it’s not really clear, it’s something else.

838
01:48:18,384 --> 01:48:24,014
And when I have seen such cases in which there is an effect after the remedy

839
01:48:24,504 --> 01:48:32,464
I cannot dispute that effect because I see the effect so... hands up.

840
01:48:32,974 --> 01:48:39,864
Maybe it’s not a clear case but what I also know is that most probably this case

841
01:48:40,144 --> 01:48:44,984
after Rhus-t. will go either to Bry. or to Calc.

842
01:48:45,774 --> 01:48:50,104
Most probable is Calc. for her.

843
01:48:50,627 --> 01:48:57,784
So I expect a certain moment to see the picture of Calc. more.

844
01:48:59,587 --> 01:49:05,464
Feeling the cold more and perhaps sweets are going to come up

845
01:49:07,578 --> 01:49:13,463
and maybe the desire for eggs will appear but these changes will be on a long period of time.

846
01:49:13,978 --> 01:49:17,303
Not like that, not quickly.

847
01:49:19,033 --> 01:49:24,752
If it was clear, what potency we could have given this moment?

848
01:49:25,028 --> 01:49:27,827
– 10M.

849
01:49:40,112 --> 01:49:44,228
Is the case clear for you?

850
01:49:48,343 --> 01:49:54,468
But do you understand the way I am explaining?

851
01:49:55,225 --> 01:50:02,387
Do you understand this way of thinking or you think I’m in the clouds?

852
01:50:06,946 --> 01:50:14,136
There was a man many years ago when I was talking and were some French homeopaths,

853
01:50:18,466 --> 01:50:23,345
I’m talking about 20 years ago, they never gave one remedy,

854
01:50:23,591 --> 01:50:25,057
they said that’s nonsense

855
01:50:29,666 --> 01:50:37,537
and when I spoke for the first time in America about one remedy one the French said

856
01:50:37,788 --> 01:50:46,306
George is such a nice guy but he’s on the clouds. He is believing in utopias.

857
01:50:48,866 --> 01:50:52,897
Now many more people believe in utopias.

858
01:51:05,948 --> 01:51:07,492
We will wait and see.

859
01:51:20,385 --> 01:51:24,748
Maybe tomorrow you will be 20% better.

860
01:51:30,382 --> 01:51:33,185
– Wonderful! Nice holidays!

861
01:51:36,507 --> 01:51:44,705
– You see she would like to have the pain gone of course but if we try she will come tomorrow

862
01:51:44,972 --> 01:51:51,105
and she will say I’m worse and that is something you don’t like to hear.

863
01:51:57,262 --> 01:52:03,148
Let’s see tomorrow. Tomorrow we will see the case and re-evaluate and I will tell you.

864
01:52:04,494 --> 01:52:07,305
Our friend there can examine her.

865
01:52:09,614 --> 01:52:21,624
– Shall she take aspirin?
– Yes, why not. She can take aspirin to reduce the pain.

866
01:52:21,904 --> 01:52:23,945
There’s no problem with aspirin, I have found out.

867
01:52:24,707 --> 01:52:29,827
Interferes very little or not at all with the homeopathic remedy.

868
01:52:31,864 --> 01:52:42,894
Our remedies are much more powerful and they can interfere quite a lot and can change quite a lot.

869
01:52:55,945 --> 01:53:11,544
My pain is gone I think completely and in the afternoon one of us gave me a little bit of craniosacral therapy

870
01:53:12,067 --> 01:53:19,747
and he wanted only to look if there is no effect that I have lumbago prolapse.

871
01:53:21,294 --> 01:53:26,665
My leg was out of feelings and it was getting colder

872
01:53:28,184 --> 01:53:36,144
and after this therapy I could stand up more and the pain was 50% gone.

873
01:53:36,654 --> 01:53:45,104
I went home and I could walk slowly. If I wasn’t moving a lot the pain was ok.

874
01:53:45,614 --> 01:53:54,574
I went to bed, I drank a lot of water and then in the morning I woke up and the pain was completely gone.

875
01:53:55,064 --> 01:53:59,427
Only when I move on my motorbike I could feel it a little bit

876
01:53:59,945 --> 01:54:10,384
but the problem is my hands were swollen in the morning and my old sinusitis was coming back.

877
01:54:11,384 --> 01:54:20,624
I had a bad cough in the morning and I had something like a stone here but now it’s gone.

878
01:54:20,867 --> 01:54:24,184
That’s also an old symptom I had it a lot of years.

879
01:54:25,225 --> 01:54:30,497
Now I am feeling well, I think it was Rhus-t. that is working out now.

880
01:54:51,492 --> 01:55:02,497
–Until she went to bed she still had a lot of pain, she just woke up in the morning feeling better,

881
01:55:03,012 --> 01:55:05,057
feeling the pain was gone.

882
01:55:05,572 --> 01:55:16,577
Now the fact remains that we should not be in a hurry to give a remedy when we see some phenomena

883
01:55:17,092 --> 01:55:20,932
which follow a certain rule of action.

884
01:55:21,186 --> 01:55:29,377
And the rule is wait and don’t interfere because if you interfere you don’t know,

885
01:55:29,892 --> 01:55:35,505
you will say what about giving another dose of Rhus-t.

886
01:55:37,826 --> 01:55:50,908
Was it going to do some harm? I don’t know if another dose of Rhus-t. will aggravate or help the case.

887
01:55:51,053 --> 01:55:57,468
The fact remains that once you see the action if the remedy that follows certain rules

888
01:55:57,732 --> 01:56:08,988
that these rules are according to the order of things, to the order of healing, you don’t interfere.

889
01:56:09,506 --> 01:56:19,746
You let this happen and proceed. I believe what he did has nothing to do with what she feels today.

890
01:56:20,257 --> 01:56:31,777
Nothing at all! The healing was happening already and followed this path.

891
01:56:36,897 --> 01:56:43,812
Here you have really the healing process which happens.

892
01:56:46,108 --> 01:56:49,948
You don’t go and interfere when this healing process is happening.

893
01:56:51,492 --> 01:57:00,452
This is the idea. And this is what we have to learn because it is difficult.

894
01:57:01,468 --> 01:57:12,824
The moment she comes in so much pain, you feel very sorry you say I have to do something.

895
01:57:13,065 --> 01:57:16,905
The best is not to do anything.

896
01:57:17,944 --> 01:57:28,505
– May I have a question? If we are giving a wrong remedy how long we should wait to go on?

897
01:57:28,746 --> 01:57:32,345
– It depends. The wrong remedy may do nothing.

898
01:57:35,664 --> 01:57:43,373
But if the wrong remedy is close to the case that’s a problem and you may have to wait some time.

899
01:57:43,624 --> 01:57:47,983
Unless you know the right remedy straightaway.

900
01:57:48,744 --> 01:57:53,346
Sometimes you have 2 possibilities and you choose one.

901
01:57:55,144 --> 01:58:01,788
The second is equally strong and the one gives some effect

902
01:58:02,063 --> 01:58:07,426
but no correct effect then you can immediately go to the second possibility.

903
01:58:07,693 --> 01:58:12,813
But if the second possibility is not clear you better wait.

904
01:58:14,032 --> 01:58:16,592
Tell me how you are today.

905
01:58:19,939 --> 01:58:27,347
– My bones were a little more painful in the morning and went to the swimming pool

906
01:58:27,619 --> 01:58:31,584
and swam a little bit and it was going better I think.

907
01:58:33,890 --> 01:58:35,170
– Cold water?
– Yes.

908
01:58:36,948 --> 01:58:42,850
– Yesterday I saw her also drinking some coffee and drank it happily!

909
01:58:49,250 --> 01:58:57,946
You have to be aware of such things because you don’t know what’s happening after she drank some coffee

910
01:58:58,980 --> 01:59:04,864
and you don’t know whether it is really a relapse or whether it is antidote by coffee.

911
01:59:05,626 --> 01:59:10,746
So there is some confusion you have to try to avoid as much as possible

912
01:59:11,010 --> 01:59:15,104
but what I wanted to say here because somebody,

913
01:59:15,348 --> 01:59:21,747
I can’t remember, asked the other day concerning Sil,

914
01:59:22,512 --> 01:59:28,665
if Sil. was given before would it have acted, I said no.

915
01:59:29,188 --> 01:59:38,387
This is the same case here. She took several times before Rhus-t. without any effect.

916
01:59:38,659 --> 01:59:44,787
There was a time when Rhus-t. appeared in the layers.

917
01:59:45,059 --> 01:59:55,299
She had to take first Lyc. or Nat-m. or whatever now in this case we cannot know exactly

918
01:59:55,545 --> 02:00:00,147
because she took several remedies some of which acted, some did not act.

919
02:00:00,419 --> 02:00:05,539
We cannot know exactly the sequence of remedies and how they acted.

920
02:00:06,032 --> 02:00:17,185
But unless we can evaluate every time what is happening in the end it will be confusion again.

921
02:00:17,975 --> 02:00:24,624
In this case in particular let us say we decided the other day to give whatever remedy

922
02:00:25,386 --> 02:00:32,304
and then there are some more symptoms and we will give another remedy and another remedy;

923
02:00:33,335 --> 02:00:39,984
will spoil the case because now the case is doing well.

924
02:00:44,345 --> 02:00:50,224
Usually when a teacher takes a case he never says this is good.

925
02:00:50,986 --> 02:00:54,137
Always the teacher wants to give a better remedy.

926
02:00:55,907 --> 02:00:59,506
This is universal egotism of all teachers.

927
02:01:01,548 --> 02:01:07,427
I’ll give you a better remedy. You never do that.

928
02:01:07,948 --> 02:01:14,866
When a remedy is correct whether it was given by herself

929
02:01:15,628 --> 02:01:22,789
or by the worst possible homeopath still the signs are that the remedy is correct.

930
02:01:25,624 --> 02:01:32,026
I had this problem a lot of times in America where I would give a remedy

931
02:01:32,544 --> 02:01:37,936
and next year I would know another 5-6 remedies were given in the meantime.

932
02:01:38,304 --> 02:01:42,906
Where the originally remedy acted beautifully and eventually they have spoiled the case.

933
02:01:43,424 --> 02:01:49,306
Invariably this was happening. George gave you a remedy, it’s no good, I will give you a better remedy.

934
02:01:49,581 --> 02:01:51,627
Eventually they spoil the case.

935
02:01:53,146 --> 02:01:58,266
That is why it is very important that we know the theory

936
02:01:59,056 --> 02:02:04,176
and we know the theory as Ruth was saying yesterday by heart.

937
02:02:04,666 --> 02:02:10,827
By the time you have the problem you cannot go to your notes and see what fits that case.

938
02:02:12,621 --> 02:02:14,667
The theory has to be learned by heart.

939
02:02:15,696 --> 02:02:19,264
M.M., repertory it’s no problem you can go look, study the case.

940
02:02:19,787 --> 02:02:27,981
What you cannot study is the theory. Should I give a remedy or not?

941
02:02:30,146 --> 02:02:36,303
There are absolute defined detailed rules for that.

942
02:02:37,308 --> 02:02:48,584
So if you have a case which is doing like that you say... hands up.

943
02:02:49,103 --> 02:02:56,783
Wait and we’ll see what happens and what happened was the right course of action.

944
02:02:57,026 --> 02:03:05,743
Now, the question is in her case her RA is going to finish?

945
02:03:06,253 --> 02:03:16,226
This is the last remedy that she will need in order to cure or to complete the cure of RA?

946
02:03:16,744 --> 02:03:21,864
I doubt it. That means after Rhus-t.

947
02:03:22,108 --> 02:03:29,026
if you wait long enough you will see another picture which might be Bry.

948
02:03:29,293 --> 02:03:34,664
which is complementary to Rhus-t. which might be Calc. complementary to Rhus-t.

949
02:03:34,908 --> 02:03:41,746
But you have to wait until such time that you see the picture of Calc.

950
02:03:42,262 --> 02:03:48,866
If you now think she is going to be Calc. let’s give her Calc. and see what happens, you spoil the case!

951
02:03:51,944 --> 02:03:53,946
Because you don’t know whether this organism

952
02:03:54,215 --> 02:04:02,702
will need a repetition of Rhus-t. 3 or 4 times before it goes to Calc.

953
02:04:02,703 --> 02:04:07,304
How many times you have to repeat? I don’t know at this moment.

954
02:04:08,584 --> 02:04:18,256
If the Rhus-t. symptoms come back you have to repeat it until they change into Calc. symptoms.

955
02:04:27,706 --> 02:04:38,412
Also she said yesterday after examination by this nice fellow he says I felt better

956
02:04:39,182 --> 02:04:45,584
which may have confused the issue but he himself I did not do anything I just examined

957
02:04:46,107 --> 02:04:49,947
because he thought it might be a hernia.

958
02:04:50,704 --> 02:04:57,742
So he wanted to see whether it is a hernia in the vertebrae.

959
02:04:58,252 --> 02:05:10,224
And he said it’s not a hernia, of course, it was an inflammation of the sacroiliac junction.

960
02:05:10,747 --> 02:05:22,704
Alright? What I wanted to make sure is that you have to be objective especially when you teach.

961
02:05:23,227 --> 02:05:27,067
This is supposed to be an advanced seminar.

962
02:05:28,611 --> 02:05:35,265
Some young students they have come from Israel they want to see Mr. Vithoulkas.

963
02:05:35,509 --> 02:05:45,706
But this is supposed to be a seminar where most of the people are teaching, not students.

964
02:05:46,986 --> 02:05:56,464
And that’s why what we say here is quite advanced. We don’t go into details and explain everything.

965
02:05:57,226 --> 02:06:07,735
Talking on teachers it is important that we are always objective in our evaluation.

966
02:06:11,575 --> 02:06:23,585
We must not say something which is outside of the rules just to make ourselves important.

967
02:06:24,106 --> 02:06:32,106
I could have given a remedy to her. Take Bell.

968
02:06:32,375 --> 02:06:34,935
And she would come today and say I am better.

969
02:06:35,705 --> 02:06:38,775
And you get the impression that she is better from Bell.

970
02:06:39,024 --> 02:06:43,895
Because I know this is going to happen. She is going to be well without any other remedy.

971
02:06:44,385 --> 02:06:47,010
So I give Bell. and I make a theory.

972
02:06:49,824 --> 02:06:57,344
And you believe that better is because of Bell., because 2 days ago I gave her Bell.

973
02:06:57,616 --> 02:07:08,496
Where the actual truth is that what I explained to you here things are going towards particular order.

974
02:07:09,261 --> 02:07:25,136
Wait. How many of you resisted this idea and you said she is so much in pain you have to do something?

975
02:07:27,696 --> 02:07:27,826
Just examine yourself. Thank you.
