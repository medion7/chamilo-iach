1
00:00:17,025 --> 00:00:21,132
What is the problem?

2
00:00:22,668 --> 00:00:30,733
– I feel in a way I’ve come through circle with a lot of things in the past

3
00:00:30,984 --> 00:00:38,146
and I feel I need to be brought together.

4
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:43,924
Issues I’ve worked things through and I’ve done things very well,

5
00:00:44,024 --> 00:00:53,264
I made progress but occasionally I have manifestation of anxiety attacks.

6
00:00:57,347 --> 00:01:04,014
Mental thoughts which are unjustified.

7
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:08,867
And I react in such a way that it’s draining my energy

8
00:01:09,134 --> 00:01:13,225
 and I realize after a while that it was unnecessary

9
00:01:13,464 --> 00:01:19,864
and my main aim now is absolutely focus on my work.

10
00:01:20,144 --> 00:01:25,264
I feel I’m very fortunate at the moment, I am very happy with my life,

11
00:01:25,507 --> 00:01:28,067
everything seems to have come together

12
00:01:28,334 --> 00:01:39,064
and part of this anxiety had to with because everything I wanted has come.

13
00:01:39,344 --> 00:01:49,827
I’m frightened of losing everything resulting back to the state I used to be.

14
00:01:50,307 --> 00:01:58,665
Most of the time I am very good but that 2% has that draining effect on me.

15
00:01:58,904 --> 00:02:04,304
– What was the state to which you are afraid that you may go back?

16
00:02:08,387 --> 00:02:21,187
– It’s like things are going very well I feel that it overwhelms some times

17
00:02:21,454 --> 00:02:36,547
and I fear I am going to ruin things, deliberately.

18
00:02:36,814 --> 00:02:45,264
– Destroy things outside or inside you?
– Outside.

19
00:02:45,507 --> 00:02:47,305
I have no problem with the inside.

20
00:02:47,824 --> 00:02:53,544
I feel strong. But on the other side I’ve always avoided outside things.

21
00:02:53,644 --> 00:02:56,930
I’ve spent a lot of my life building the inside

22
00:02:57,184 --> 00:03:04,864
and now it’s materializing and sometimes every step of the way I have to check to see

23
00:03:05,108 --> 00:03:07,170
that I’m doing it for the right reason

24
00:03:07,424 --> 00:03:12,190
and if I have the slightest doubt I am not I have to pull it down again.

25
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:17,908
This is the first time in my life I am actually building the outside and it feels good.

26
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,784
– Give me an example because I don’t really understand.

27
00:03:32,705 --> 00:03:44,746
– It’s very important that everything I do is on every level is being true to myself

28
00:03:45,015 --> 00:03:52,944
and if I feel any falseness is cracked into my thinking in my life I have to destroy it.

29
00:03:56,266 --> 00:04:03,426
Anything that is not genuine I cannot tolerate.

30
00:04:03,947 --> 00:04:07,166
– She has to be true to herself.

31
00:04:07,266 --> 00:04:08,606
If she feels she is not true to herself,

32
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:11,618
she has to destroy anything that isn’t true to herself.

33
00:04:11,764 --> 00:04:21,347
– Yes. And sometimes I find myself deliberately provoking situations to test...

34
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:26,367
- Can you give me an example because you are talking very theoretically

35
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:30,718
and I don’t understand what it exactly means.

36
00:04:30,818 --> 00:04:35,747
Give me an example. Are you married?
– No.

37
00:04:35,986 --> 00:04:41,292
– You never married?
– No. I was determined to sort myself out,

38
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:43,585
feel strong enough, have no children

39
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:55,105
but I am at the moment for the first time I am in a committed relationship

40
00:04:55,372 --> 00:04:58,945
that hopefully will marry next year.

41
00:04:59,212 --> 00:05:05,102
My work, what I do in Homeopathy, is my life in the sense that I couldn’t do other things.

42
00:05:05,345 --> 00:05:14,572
I found out what I was meant to do and I have quite a history in the past of incidents

43
00:05:14,828 --> 00:05:19,425
that have happened which I have overcome which have been very severe.

44
00:05:19,692 --> 00:05:30,188
– Like?
– A brief little history of what has been in the past;

45
00:05:30,427 --> 00:05:42,222
I was a very happy child, spontaneous, I was brought in quite strict, religious background.

46
00:05:42,465 --> 00:06:10,045
At 16 I was attacked, raped and as a result of that I cut off from the outside world

47
00:06:10,184 --> 00:06:21,904
and I had no relationships till I was 25 and during that time I started very much

48
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:25,505
to want to sort myself out on a deeper level.

49
00:06:25,744 --> 00:06:31,141
– How did you do that? By the help of a psychiatrist or psychologist?

50
00:06:31,387 --> 00:06:36,771
– Myself. I started to be interested in things.

51
00:06:37,025 --> 00:06:43,071
– After this rape you did not consult any psychologist?
– No.

52
00:06:43,171 --> 00:06:48,784
– No psychologist, no psychiatrist. You tried to heal yourself.

53
00:06:49,061 --> 00:06:51,105
– Yes I did. It was quite difficult;

54
00:06:51,344 --> 00:07:03,905
I went through a few stages of suicidal attempts and gained 5 stone weight.

55
00:07:11,824 --> 00:07:16,705
– It’s 30 kilos.

56
00:07:19,591 --> 00:07:27,707
– What I was trying to say is that in the past I’ve overcome these things.

57
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:38,704
It made me realize what’s important in life, not superficial things,

58
00:07:38,981 --> 00:07:46,145
I’ve always had opportunities to do well on the material level.

59
00:07:48,451 --> 00:07:55,427
– You studied something?
– Yes, I used to be a lawyer.

60
00:07:57,746 --> 00:08:01,068
– Did you finish your studies?
– I did but I hated it.

61
00:08:01,337 --> 00:08:07,268
Because the kind of work that I had to do was very...

62
00:08:07,337 --> 00:08:12,623
- My question is, did you finish your studies or gave it up?

63
00:08:12,866 --> 00:08:16,088
– I dropped right to end.

64
00:08:16,188 --> 00:08:24,590
I did all my studies for 5-6 years and then packed it in when I was in the last stage.

65
00:08:24,866 --> 00:08:29,632
Then I came across Homeopathy.

66
00:08:29,732 --> 00:08:33,267
– And then you went to one of these schools of Homeopathy?

67
00:08:33,508 --> 00:08:38,138
– At what age?
– 30.

68
00:08:41,868 --> 00:08:49,384
– Until that time you did not have any treatment either allopathic or homeopathic?

69
00:08:49,658 --> 00:08:52,983
– No. I refused allopathic treatment.

70
00:08:54,778 --> 00:09:04,744
I was always forced to have allopathic treatment because my mood swings I had.

71
00:09:05,018 --> 00:09:09,348
– Did you break things, did you hit somebody?

72
00:09:09,623 --> 00:09:11,908
Why did they force you to have treatment?

73
00:09:12,183 --> 00:09:17,818
– Because I cut myself off and I became aggressive.

74
00:09:18,067 --> 00:09:22,664
I wanted to kill everything. I never killed anybody. It was all inside.

75
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:31,383
I used to pull my hair out and scratch my face and destroy myself.

76
00:09:31,624 --> 00:09:36,228
– And when you attempted suicide through which means did you attempt?

77
00:09:36,503 --> 00:09:43,144
– Pills overdose.
– What pills?

78
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:53,143
– It was rather the amount than...
- Were psychiatric pills?

79
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:59,784
– No, just ordinary like paracetamol, aspirin, anything...

80
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:09,508
- How many times you did that?
– I did that twice.

81
00:10:09,783 --> 00:10:15,908
– How were you saved? Taken to hospital or vomited?

82
00:10:18,068 --> 00:10:29,347
– First time vomited and second time taken to hospital. But I managed to get out.

83
00:10:29,447 --> 00:10:32,787
They wanted to give me treatment there but I wanted to get out of that.

84
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:42,019
I lied basically. I never told people what was the matter.

85
00:10:42,265 --> 00:10:47,385
I couldn’t talk to anybody and I wouldn’t.

86
00:10:47,632 --> 00:10:50,192
– Is it easy for you to talk about these things now?

87
00:10:50,468 --> 00:10:54,819
– Yes, but only after Homeopathy treatment.

88
00:10:55,065 --> 00:11:05,205
I couldn’t discuss it till my 30s, now it feels I got passed all this and I only mention it

89
00:11:05,305 --> 00:11:09,344
because maybe they are relevant to those state I get back to.

90
00:11:09,588 --> 00:11:19,066
I feel 98% ok. That’s why.
– Can you tell me what remedies you took?

91
00:11:19,584 --> 00:11:33,908
– Yes. Ign. 1M April 1990, Ign. May 1990, Carc. 1M September 1990,

92
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:46,708
Staph. 1M November 1990, Stram. 200C 1993, Anac. 1M I gave that myself,

93
00:11:46,808 --> 00:12:00,290
Plat. 1M May 1996, Aur. 10M I gave that myself June 1996

94
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:05,945
because I was given Plat. and I know it’s very suicidal and I knew I needed Aur.

95
00:12:08,505 --> 00:12:18,465
Then I had for emergency reasons Lach. for a complication in surgical procedure.

96
00:12:18,745 --> 00:12:23,095
That worked very well.
– 1M?

97
00:12:23,344 --> 00:12:40,225
– No. It was 30C repeated about 5 times. Nat-m. 1M in June 1997 and Zinc. May 1999.

98
00:12:40,505 --> 00:12:52,784
Theozamine June 1999 and Zinc. September 2000. That’s all!

99
00:12:52,884 --> 00:12:57,904
– What was the result of this treatment?

100
00:12:58,145 --> 00:13:13,505
– The first remedy I had, Ign., the first 3 days I got an energy boost and then felt nothing.

101
00:13:13,785 --> 00:13:21,976
The repeat, nothing. Carc. nothing. Staph. nothing except I got skin eruption

102
00:13:22,225 --> 00:13:25,026
which lasted for a very long time.

103
00:13:27,586 --> 00:13:33,227
Stram. very good. That was the best reaction I ever had.

104
00:13:33,986 --> 00:13:43,985
Anac. I felt it on the edge of the aggression I was going through. Plat. nothing.

105
00:13:44,126 --> 00:13:51,665
– Anac.?
– Medium reaction.

106
00:13:51,906 --> 00:13:55,746
I was getting very extreme I was afraid I would kill somebody.

107
00:13:56,026 --> 00:14:02,426
I was really that bad. I was getting aggressive. 1M.

108
00:14:04,216 --> 00:14:09,336
– What year?
– 1995.

109
00:14:09,585 --> 00:14:14,456
-  And Stram. was 1993.

110
00:14:14,705 --> 00:14:22,136
– Why didn’t you repeat Stram. if it was so good? You repeated it?

111
00:14:22,385 --> 00:14:33,656
– No. I only had it once.
– Between 1993 and 1995 I see a gap without.

112
00:14:33,805 --> 00:14:39,266
– Because Stram. did very well, I was actually doing very well for about a year or more.

113
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:45,325
I actually went back to my homeopath who gave me Stram. about after a year

114
00:14:45,425 --> 00:14:47,226
and he said it didn’t do anything.

115
00:14:47,467 --> 00:14:54,136
So I felt it in an Anac. state because very suddenly he wasn’t available,

116
00:14:54,385 --> 00:14:57,707
so I took it myself.

117
00:14:57,976 --> 00:14:59,214
– And in 1996...

118
00:14:59,363 --> 00:15:03,826
- He gave Plat. when I was in bad state and did nothing.

119
00:15:04,098 --> 00:15:09,464
I took Aur. And that did take the edge of things because I was so frightened,

120
00:15:09,711 --> 00:15:14,584
I would do it again and I knew it’s no point,

121
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:17,291
you can’t keep your through your life keep repeating...

122
00:15:17,391 --> 00:15:21,917
I literally made the decision after the second suicide attempt,

123
00:15:22,017 --> 00:15:29,697
I said to myself if you go and do it again there was no point.

124
00:15:29,948 --> 00:15:35,586
And I made a promise to myself that no matter what happens I will never do that again.

125
00:15:35,825 --> 00:15:41,217
So when I saw myself getting in such a state I took the Aur. myself.

126
00:15:41,468 --> 00:15:48,032
And it took the edge of it. And then Nat-m. did nothing.

127
00:15:48,132 --> 00:15:50,545
Zinc. actually did help a little.

128
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:54,146
I was surprised I needed it, I thought it was a funny prescription.

129
00:15:54,385 --> 00:16:05,148
I was so all over the place. No energy, not focused and very mental and physical fidgety.

130
00:16:06,646 --> 00:16:09,745
It helped building the outside.

131
00:16:10,017 --> 00:16:19,492
Theozamine nothing and Zinc. 200C to the edge of the things again.

132
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:25,628
I don’t think I am in a bad way at the moment.

133
00:16:27,665 --> 00:16:39,457
– What is that 2% that bothers you? A state of panic?

134
00:16:39,857 --> 00:16:46,455
– I get paralyzed. I feel as though everything’s overwhelming and I can’t cope with things.

135
00:16:46,704 --> 00:16:52,345
I feel like I’ve got the capability, I know what I want to do,

136
00:16:52,486 --> 00:16:57,185
I’ve got a lot to do and I feel very confident a lot of the time.

137
00:16:57,465 --> 00:17:02,826
But when I get this 2% it’s like I can’t even begin to try control it.

138
00:17:03,095 --> 00:17:06,145
It’s so overwhelming, I feel paralyzed.

139
00:17:13,135 --> 00:17:20,915
I can cope with this now, it’s so rare but is still there, getting less and less.

140
00:17:21,015 --> 00:17:24,492
It’s very extreme when it happens and it takes me out for a week after.

141
00:17:24,748 --> 00:17:30,107
I feel so drained, very tired afterwards.

142
00:17:35,102 --> 00:17:40,347
– Exactly an example you are afraid of losing?

143
00:17:51,052 --> 00:17:56,172
– It’s very difficult when I am not in the state to explain it

144
00:17:56,428 --> 00:18:02,305
but I just think that anything I build I’ll sabotage it.

145
00:18:02,572 --> 00:18:10,922
It’s like I build something too high, I like to trigger a reaction

146
00:18:11,022 --> 00:18:20,987
that I can justify finishing with something before that I can say...

147
00:18:21,772 --> 00:18:29,411
- If you will give us an example like I had a relationship and then this happened

148
00:18:29,665 --> 00:18:37,345
and this is what I thought and this is how it ended up... Real example.

149
00:18:39,905 --> 00:18:43,984
– In the past I had 2 abortions.

150
00:18:44,261 --> 00:18:53,885
And there were circumstances where I was frightened of the circumstances.

151
00:18:53,985 --> 00:19:01,411
I didn’t feel it was right for me on lots of levels and it was very difficult decisions.

152
00:19:01,665 --> 00:19:07,301
Especially the first. Emotionally I was terrible.

153
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:12,421
It wasn’t an easy decision. But I had to.

154
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:18,051
I felt unless I am strong and got everything in perspective

155
00:19:18,151 --> 00:19:28,191
it’s just not right to build anything and although looking back I think for me on a deeper level

156
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:32,466
it was the right choice apart from the fear of not being right

157
00:19:32,707 --> 00:19:45,017
but in the present time I am very happy with my relationship and it’s very good I think.

158
00:19:45,266 --> 00:19:56,537
But there is a part of me which is frightened if I’ll deliberately destroy it.

159
00:19:57,027 --> 00:20:06,926
– You are afraid of your past, that the habits of your past may come back and you destroy something.

160
00:20:07,026 --> 00:20:12,173
– I don’t think they will but every now and then it’s there.

161
00:20:15,203 --> 00:20:19,343
When it comes on my I shake.

162
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:25,986
And if anyone says anything to me I take it the wrong way,

163
00:20:26,253 --> 00:20:33,933
any comment I think it’s a personal attack and I overreact.

164
00:20:34,946 --> 00:20:42,283
– Can you give me an example? Swearing? Shouting? Hitting?

165
00:20:42,383 --> 00:20:49,293
– I get quite aggressive myself. Perhaps be sharp with people and I shouldn’t be.

166
00:20:49,544 --> 00:20:57,468
I pick something which I think will hurt and say it to get them before they get me.

167
00:20:57,743 --> 00:21:05,148
I do that, not very often, but I do that.

168
00:21:05,666 --> 00:21:15,663
I’m also very suspicious  finding very difficult to trust people.

169
00:21:20,264 --> 00:21:25,903
If you’re by yourself, you’re ok because none can get to you.

170
00:21:26,146 --> 00:21:32,028
But I’m not like that. I want to be with people and I want to be in relationship

171
00:21:32,303 --> 00:21:37,323
but I have this fear that one day the floor is going to be pulled under the feet

172
00:21:37,423 --> 00:21:43,304
everything will scatter and I’, frightened because if I get in that case...

173
00:21:45,103 --> 00:21:55,854
I know how I got before and I’m frightened...

174
00:21:56,867 --> 00:22:02,644
- All these remedies you have taken did somebody else give it to you

175
00:22:02,744 --> 00:22:05,496
or are the self-prescribed?

176
00:22:05,745 --> 00:22:13,176
– I got 2 myself; Aur. 10M and Anac.

177
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:16,027
– All the others have been given by a homeopath.

178
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:20,624
The homeopath who has given them to you is inside the class?

179
00:22:20,901 --> 00:22:28,065
– No. Just of the remedies, the Zinc.

180
00:22:28,204 --> 00:22:32,421
Apart from that I’ve seen 3-4 homeopaths through.

181
00:22:36,507 --> 00:22:41,627
I’ve got some generals, may be relevant.

182
00:22:43,941 --> 00:22:57,241
What I tend to do is if I am upset emotionally I have this hobby of needing,

183
00:22:57,351 --> 00:23:03,651
it’s not fear of loneliness, for comfort if it warm weather, not very hot weather,

184
00:23:03,905 --> 00:23:06,704
I need a hot water bottle.

185
00:23:07,464 --> 00:23:13,825
It doesn’t release anything any upset or if I feel shaky or worried.

186
00:23:19,584 --> 00:23:22,188
I have to hold it like this.

187
00:23:22,427 --> 00:23:27,308
– Because you feel inner coldness?
– I know thing.

188
00:23:27,547 --> 00:23:33,496
When I have these attacks it’s interesting. I often feel it’s like coldness.

189
00:23:33,986 --> 00:23:42,456
When it is very extreme and things are being really upsetting I feel like ice inside sometimes.

190
00:23:44,226 --> 00:23:49,105
I love hot drinks, I drink gallons of very hot tea.

191
00:23:49,626 --> 00:23:58,065
I feel better for eating all the time, I love food. My appetite is very good.

192
00:23:58,306 --> 00:24:06,028
Physically I don’t think I have any problem on every level, in sleep or anything.

193
00:24:06,267 --> 00:24:11,662
I think I am happy at the moment. I’ve purpose.

194
00:24:12,172 --> 00:24:18,305
– Did always speak in this way, very fast?
– Yes.

195
00:24:18,572 --> 00:24:23,425
Sometimes I’m alright, slower.

196
00:24:23,692 --> 00:24:30,862
But if I feel a bit excited I can do a little bit too much.

197
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:38,542
One thing that might be relevant.

198
00:24:39,052 --> 00:24:46,888
I have a situation a whole life with my mother.

199
00:24:46,988 --> 00:24:54,412
She has always been very difficult and I was undermined a lot of my confidence.

200
00:24:54,668 --> 00:25:04,385
– The first time that you said you were raped it was somebody from your relatives?

201
00:25:04,485 --> 00:25:14,382
– I joined the police at 16, a cadet, and he was an instructor in charge.

202
00:25:19,745 --> 00:25:30,408
I was very young. It was an authority figure.

203
00:25:30,508 --> 00:25:39,468
And I do have a bit of resentment against the people who trigger me off,

204
00:25:39,982 --> 00:25:45,102
people who are perhaps quite pompous and arrogant.

205
00:25:47,662 --> 00:25:50,222
I take an instant despite to them.

206
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:58,412
Maybe they don’t mean to be but if I perceive them to be superior and thinking this superior,

207
00:25:58,668 --> 00:26:06,862
I don’t get I want to kill them back again, I can recall that feeling.

208
00:26:07,105 --> 00:26:08,285
– Aggression.

209
00:26:08,385 --> 00:26:12,752
– Yes because when you trust somebody who is supposed to be looking after you

210
00:26:13,028 --> 00:26:15,588
and they take advantage of that situation

211
00:26:15,827 --> 00:26:21,219
and you get angry with yourself for allowing yourself to be so susceptible.

212
00:26:21,712 --> 00:26:26,832
And yet you shouldn’t do that. I am struggling to be strong enough.

213
00:26:27,108 --> 00:26:32,467
– This experience which seems to be quite important for your case

214
00:26:32,739 --> 00:26:42,979
came as a surprise to you or it was expected because he was flirting?

215
00:26:43,472 --> 00:26:49,379
– It was interesting because he was the kind of person who was much older,

216
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:52,332
a sergeant training cadets.

217
00:26:52,432 --> 00:26:56,985
A lot of the girls 16 used to enjoy flirting with him

218
00:26:57,232 --> 00:27:04,147
but I wasn’t like that. He was a little bit false.

219
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:09,785
He was the kind of person who would say the right things to the right people

220
00:27:10,032 --> 00:27:13,107
to get a promotion and never got it.

221
00:27:13,379 --> 00:27:16,432
In the people who were below he wouldn’t get any interest.

222
00:27:21,552 --> 00:27:26,425
I wasn’t going out with anybody, even though I was 16.

223
00:27:26,672 --> 00:27:38,979
I just spoke to him as I would always with his last name.

224
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:42,427
He liked the girls call him by his first name and be friendly,

225
00:27:42,691 --> 00:27:45,405
I called him by his second name.

226
00:27:45,505 --> 00:27:48,706
There was something about that I shouldn’t really like.

227
00:27:48,986 --> 00:27:56,145
I don’t hate him or dislike him. He started by picking on me.

228
00:27:56,245 --> 00:27:59,864
He said I did things which I hadn’t done.

229
00:28:00,144 --> 00:28:02,424
We used to do training, running and swimming

230
00:28:02,704 --> 00:28:06,264
and he said that I was laughing at him.

231
00:28:06,544 --> 00:28:10,627
– How long you stayed there in the police?

232
00:28:10,727 --> 00:28:17,445
– I carried on in the cadets for 2.5 years and then I did my 2.5 years as a constable.

233
00:28:17,545 --> 00:28:22,414
I completed my probation. I left when I was 21.

234
00:28:28,304 --> 00:28:39,054
– What I want to understand is he really raped you or he tried to?
– He did.

235
00:28:39,305 --> 00:28:44,564
– And it was your first experience.
– Yes.

236
00:28:44,664 --> 00:28:49,784
I thought I was going to die, that he wanted to kill.

237
00:28:50,064 --> 00:28:54,665
He threatened me with a knife and I’ve still got a scar,

238
00:28:54,904 --> 00:28:58,505
he broke a bottle and cut me a little bit.

239
00:28:58,744 --> 00:29:03,864
I was so disappointed of myself because I wanted to fight

240
00:29:04,144 --> 00:29:15,564
but I thought it would get very violent if I try to fight so I almost cut off emotionally,

241
00:29:15,664 --> 00:29:17,904
I just switched off and couldn’t feel anything.

242
00:29:18,147 --> 00:29:21,744
And I honestly thought I would get out alive, I thought I would die.

243
00:29:21,987 --> 00:29:29,424
That fear stayed with me, till I had Stram. I was never of the fear till I had Stram.

244
00:29:29,524 --> 00:29:32,984
– Now, this feeling comes back sometimes?

245
00:29:34,264 --> 00:29:39,907
- That terrible feeling never got back as bad. It was like feeling half-dead.

246
00:29:40,174 --> 00:29:44,504
Emotionally I couldn’t relate.
– You were paralyzed.

247
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:50,414
– Yes. No relationship. I couldn’t relate till I was 25 I never went out.

248
00:29:50,665 --> 00:29:57,304
And I went to extremes. Between 16 and 25 I never went out with anybody.

249
00:29:57,584 --> 00:30:03,984
Not even kissed. 25 just like that I started going out with lots of people.

250
00:30:04,227 --> 00:30:09,614
Within one week I got out 6-7 people. From one extreme to another.

251
00:30:09,865 --> 00:30:13,705
I was trying to feel something.

252
00:30:14,985 --> 00:30:21,385
– At this time did you enjoy going out or it was bad experience again?

253
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:30,345
– It was different because I didn’t feel right.

254
00:30:30,574 --> 00:30:34,296
I was like observing. It wasn’t really me.

255
00:30:36,066 --> 00:30:43,746
– You were doing this out of curiosity and see how you will feel?

256
00:30:45,026 --> 00:30:46,827
– I think it’s a bit right.

257
00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:57,826
I don’t know why I spent 11 years not going socializing, not going out with people.

258
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,907
It’s just how I felt.

259
00:31:01,176 --> 00:31:03,985
– But after you started going out...?

260
00:31:04,226 --> 00:31:12,428
– It was better for me because to be able to communicate better with people.

261
00:31:13,977 --> 00:31:20,867
– This incident was not reported to the police?
– No.

262
00:31:21,142 --> 00:31:25,987
– And it was just one time and didn’t try again.
– No.

263
00:31:26,508 --> 00:31:36,748
– Did you threat him?
– I got transferred.

264
00:31:37,017 --> 00:31:49,817
There was an incident just after then he tried to threaten me,

265
00:31:50,582 --> 00:31:55,948
accidents can happen and I turned around very aggressively

266
00:31:56,217 --> 00:32:04,813
and said I could kill him but I didn’t.

267
00:32:05,064 --> 00:32:11,213
Interestingly, there was an incident 2 years ago, where I feel better.

268
00:32:11,708 --> 00:32:18,626
Almost a similar thing happened in my clinic where I work.

269
00:32:19,144 --> 00:32:26,824
I was attacked, attempted this time I fought him off and I took the case to court,

270
00:32:27,068 --> 00:32:29,903
it was a trial and it was very difficult.

271
00:32:30,146 --> 00:32:35,266
I got him convicted and I felt that’s what I should have done years ago.

272
00:32:35,533 --> 00:32:38,588
It gave me an opportunity in a field with than unresolved issue

273
00:32:38,863 --> 00:32:46,024
because I felt much stronger then.

274
00:32:50,893 --> 00:32:58,063
– How do you feel in the dark now?
– I’m fine now.

275
00:32:58,306 --> 00:33:02,413
– Before?
– It was terrible.

276
00:33:04,063 --> 00:33:12,904
In those I was absolute picture case of Stram. I had terrible nightmares for 6 years,

277
00:33:13,148 --> 00:33:17,506
terrible dreams of being chased by black,

278
00:33:17,673 --> 00:33:21,346
vicious dogs that ripped me to pieces, I could feel the pain.

279
00:33:22,383 --> 00:33:27,228
When I had my Stram. I had a tremendous aggravation.

280
00:33:27,503 --> 00:33:42,763
I went upstairs, I went to a corner and I was shaken,

281
00:33:42,863 --> 00:33:48,644
so frightened to move out of the corner till the afternoon of the next morning.

282
00:33:48,744 --> 00:33:49,705
– Stayed there the whole night?

283
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:55,344
– I couldn’t move. I stayed in the nighttime, that was interesting after Stram.

284
00:33:55,587 --> 00:33:58,147
– And when did you start feeling better.

285
00:33:58,414 --> 00:34:05,484
– 2 days after I walk up with without a dark,

286
00:34:05,584 --> 00:34:09,044
heavy feeling that I have carried with me.

287
00:34:09,144 --> 00:34:14,954
The heaviness was gone. It was the most amazing reaction to remedy I’ve ever had.

288
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:19,807
– And the fourth or fifth day you started feeling lighter?

289
00:34:19,907 --> 00:34:26,064
– Yes. I felt like my old self again.

290
00:34:26,307 --> 00:34:31,694
I used to be very light and I became very heavy, dark,

291
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:35,205
used to think about death all the time.

292
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:48,824
– Now you can sleep in the dark without any problem or you need still some light.

293
00:34:49,104 --> 00:35:00,105
– I’m alright now. I usually, when I am by myself, I like to see the night light, the sky.

294
00:35:00,624 --> 00:35:05,644
And funny enough, one thing I have noticed is,

295
00:35:05,744 --> 00:35:14,947
my present partner wants to sleep in 100% dark and I am ok with it with him.

296
00:35:15,214 --> 00:35:18,025
In the past I couldn’t be like that with anybody.

297
00:35:18,264 --> 00:35:23,907
I couldn’t stand the dark. I’m alright now.

298
00:35:30,574 --> 00:35:40,814
– What I asked before, at the age of 26 you started going out and having affairs,

299
00:35:41,065 --> 00:35:46,704
were you able to function sexually?

300
00:35:47,214 --> 00:35:54,627
– Yes, but not really. Mechanically. I didn’t get anything out of it.

301
00:35:55,145 --> 00:35:58,734
It’s a bit of ego boost, I guess,

302
00:35:58,985 --> 00:36:06,147
because I got a lot of attention and I found out a lot of people wanted to go out with me and nice people.

303
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:11,785
I guess on one level but for myself I felt out of it.

304
00:36:15,864 --> 00:36:29,705
I realized after short time that I didn’t want to go out with many people

305
00:36:29,944 --> 00:36:36,344
and so chose 1 person out of 7 that I decide I quite like

306
00:36:36,624 --> 00:36:45,065
and I’ll go out with him as boyfriend and I stayed with him for 8 years.

307
00:36:45,304 --> 00:36:51,465
I never really loved him and he knew that and he said I do and I will do.

308
00:36:53,507 --> 00:36:58,627
I used to feel very bad that I knew and used to tell him.

309
00:36:58,794 --> 00:37:02,367
We had good times and he was a very nice person

310
00:37:02,467 --> 00:37:12,184
but a bit possessive and restrictive and I had problems when I decided I wanted to get away from him.

311
00:37:14,744 --> 00:37:21,424
He was very clingy and saying he will kill himself if I do that.

312
00:37:21,667 --> 00:37:26,264
But I had to get away and it was the second time when I got into a bad state,

313
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:29,765
suicidal, I had to decide, I felt so trapped.

314
00:37:29,865 --> 00:37:32,266
I thought I can’t have the responsibility for someone else doing that.

315
00:37:32,535 --> 00:37:34,585
I can’t live with him.

316
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:39,705
And what managed make me break away was I met someone who’s completely different,

317
00:37:39,946 --> 00:37:44,445
much younger and that was a genuine relationship.

318
00:37:44,545 --> 00:37:46,267
I’ve only had 2 genuine relationships.

319
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:51,651
– The one you have now?
– This is the second.

320
00:37:52,421 --> 00:37:59,331
– How do you feel with the last relationship?

321
00:38:00,347 --> 00:38:07,504
– When I met this younger person it was a very good healing relationship.

322
00:38:07,781 --> 00:38:10,226
We used to talk about things, I discussed things that happened.

323
00:38:10,467 --> 00:38:14,582
We were interested in so many different things and we helped each other.

324
00:38:14,828 --> 00:38:22,262
Even though we knew it wouldn’t last forever, I knew that but it was right for me.

325
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:27,382
You need it now but I knew you will get out of it and he was a lot younger.

326
00:38:27,628 --> 00:38:31,222
We finished at the right time.

327
00:38:31,737 --> 00:38:37,106
But it was a good relationship and I did the right thing in finishing it.

328
00:38:37,347 --> 00:38:40,846
The present relationship I think is very good.

329
00:38:47,824 --> 00:39:06,383
– How old is he?
– He is 65 in 3 weeks!

330
00:39:06,626 --> 00:39:15,068
– But you still feel comfortable.
– Can you function with him sexually?

331
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:20,973
– Yes very good. But on every level.

332
00:39:21,224 --> 00:39:25,064
– With the younger one were you functioning sexually?

333
00:39:25,164 --> 00:39:31,213
– Yes. These were the 2 relationships that were functioning.

334
00:39:31,464 --> 00:39:38,108
– That means you were enjoying sex.
– Yes.

335
00:39:41,948 --> 00:39:44,508
– You want to say something more?

336
00:39:52,706 --> 00:39:59,624
– I do feel very good with the present relationship

337
00:39:59,868 --> 00:40:03,464
because although the other relationship was very good as well

338
00:40:03,983 --> 00:40:11,663
it felt more like I was still finding what I wanted to do myself

339
00:40:11,906 --> 00:40:16,013
and now I feel on every level we can complement each other very well.

340
00:40:20,623 --> 00:40:26,253
I’m not making excuses I feel genuinely challenged in the right way.

341
00:40:26,748 --> 00:40:35,708
– If you had this original man in front of you would you still like to kill him?

342
00:40:35,983 --> 00:40:45,186
– It’s a very interesting question! No. I went through that.

343
00:40:45,704 --> 00:40:46,984
 – How?

344
00:40:48,548 --> 00:40:55,952
– I worked through it. Because of what I believe in. It is not a religion.

345
00:40:56,052 --> 00:41:04,912
I truly believe that what comes around goes around and in a way he triggered things in my life

346
00:41:05,188 --> 00:41:08,505
which I would have gone along a certain path.

347
00:41:08,752 --> 00:41:13,379
I’ve got wonderful things happening now which I believe wouldn’t have happened.

348
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:21,552
I feel now it was worth working through things.

349
00:41:21,828 --> 00:41:25,392
And if he is still alive, he had a lot of enemies actually,

350
00:41:25,668 --> 00:41:30,019
he was the type of person who would remove people, male colleagues,

351
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:38,707
he’d get them lose their job. To live with himself must be very difficult.

352
00:41:38,979 --> 00:41:47,152
Because ultimately I think peace of mind is the most important thing and he can’t possibly have it.

353
00:41:48,947 --> 00:41:52,787
– So you feel he has been punished already?

354
00:41:52,887 --> 00:41:59,088
– I don’t know but I think sooner or later it will happen.

355
00:41:59,188 --> 00:42:02,667
The last comment I was going to make has to do with my current situation.

356
00:42:02,785 --> 00:42:06,307
I do worry a little about my parents, my mother.

357
00:42:06,582 --> 00:42:15,788
She is a bit mentally ill and she had a big effect on me in my lifetime.

358
00:42:16,057 --> 00:42:23,468
As I get older I realize the I can’t be responsible for her.

359
00:42:23,737 --> 00:42:38,066
– Is she in an asylum?
– No. She is very split personality now.

360
00:42:38,307 --> 00:42:42,422
I’ve tried to relate to her and she’ll very aggressive with me.

361
00:42:42,668 --> 00:42:48,722
Nasty things she will say and deny and that’s been very upsetting recently.

362
00:42:48,822 --> 00:42:59,062
– Do you still have dreams of violence?
– No. Very rarely.

363
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:08,389
– Did you ever take drugs in any period of your life like marijuana?

364
00:43:08,664 --> 00:43:14,025
– No. One thing I’ve always been, no matter how hard things got,

365
00:43:14,294 --> 00:43:22,744
I would not accept allopathic medicine. I wouldn’t touch drugs.

366
00:43:22,985 --> 00:43:32,214
I am not even drinking. I enjoy it but I am not really a drinker.

367
00:43:32,468 --> 00:43:39,625
– Marijuana?
– Got once purely out of curiosity.

368
00:43:39,894 --> 00:43:46,209
– Did it have any effect on you?
– Yes. I got the smallest amount.

369
00:43:47,644 --> 00:43:56,788
But it wasn’t me. I’ve got always to be controlled. I didn’t need it.

370
00:44:03,429 --> 00:44:14,220
– Where you infected by any veneral infection?
– No, I’ve never had.

371
00:44:18,575 --> 00:44:24,708
– Do you perspire?
– I am at the moment but not usually.

372
00:44:24,975 --> 00:44:31,375
– You feel cold or hot?
– I tend to be on the chilly side.

373
00:44:31,626 --> 00:44:34,425
– Your feet are usually cold or normal?

374
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:38,540
– Everybody who touches them complains there are very cold.

375
00:44:38,788 --> 00:44:50,826
They can get cold. Sometimes I’m very cold but I don’t feel cold.

376
00:44:51,065 --> 00:44:53,135
People say oh you’re cold!

377
00:44:53,386 --> 00:44:56,708
– When they touch you.
– Yes.

378
00:44:58,255 --> 00:45:05,420
– Do you put on weight easily?
– Only if I deserve to.

379
00:45:05,668 --> 00:45:10,026
I have to eat quite a lot to put on some weight.

380
00:45:10,506 --> 00:45:13,292
If people ate what I eat would be much bigger!

381
00:45:13,548 --> 00:45:15,811
I have quite a good appetite.

382
00:45:16,065 --> 00:45:19,905
– Do you eat sweets as well? What do you like to eat?

383
00:45:20,931 --> 00:45:35,265
– I don’t like shellfish. I love pasta, potatoes, chocolate.

384
00:45:35,504 --> 00:45:38,064
I like it as well as other things.

385
00:45:38,587 --> 00:45:45,625
I like puddings, not too sweet, sweetish.

386
00:45:49,091 --> 00:46:00,611
I like things like chilly, onions...
- Thirst?

387
00:46:00,865 --> 00:46:07,011
– I would say I am not thirsty but I drink lots of tea so I take a lot of liquid.

388
00:46:07,504 --> 00:46:12,131
I drink 30 cups a day!
– Warm?

389
00:46:12,231 --> 00:46:20,346
– Very hot! I love very hot temperature in food and drink.

390
00:46:22,747 --> 00:46:29,306
– Are you fastidious at all?
– No. The opposite.

391
00:46:29,547 --> 00:46:37,506
One of the things regarding that is I get very frustrated with the clutter.

392
00:46:42,165 --> 00:46:56,186
I want to simplify things. I seem to attract it!
– Do you have any fears?

393
00:47:06,146 --> 00:47:19,824
 – I guess I’ve covered it in the sense that I have a fear about making a wrong decision.

394
00:47:28,361 --> 00:47:38,267
 I used to have terrible fear of insanity when I was a child.

395
00:47:38,531 --> 00:47:42,371
I don’t have that anymore. I know I am not!

396
00:47:46,327 --> 00:47:49,814
– Do you eat eggs?
– I like eggs, yes.

397
00:47:50,068 --> 00:47:52,374
– Very much?
–Yes.

398
00:47:52,669 --> 00:47:58,264
– Do you have fear from high places looking down?

399
00:47:58,505 --> 00:48:03,909
– I wouldn’t say it’s a fear, I wouldn’t go to edge of places.

400
00:48:14,129 --> 00:48:18,148
– Fear of death?
– Not anymore.

401
00:48:18,423 --> 00:48:23,027
– I spent a lot of time thinking about these things.

402
00:48:23,543 --> 00:48:30,458
When decided after my second suicide attempt that I will never do that again

403
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:40,698
I imagined myself doing that and thinking if I am dead then that’s it so what do I got to lose?

404
00:48:40,957 --> 00:48:44,304
I imagined I’ve done it and everything else is a bonus!

405
00:48:44,547 --> 00:48:48,387
I am not frightened of anything. I’m pretty fearless in some respect.

406
00:48:48,654 --> 00:48:52,227
I would take any kind of challenge.

407
00:48:52,494 --> 00:48:56,958
I don’t mean silly challenge, within reason.

408
00:48:57,058 --> 00:49:00,464
Nothing really frightens me anymore.

409
00:49:00,705 --> 00:49:04,055
I’d react to things.
– Dogs?

410
00:49:05,705 --> 00:49:08,565
– It has to be a vicious, aggressive dog.

411
00:49:08,665 --> 00:49:14,256
Even then I would think, I am really good in thinking in nervous situation, I keep calm.

412
00:49:14,356 --> 00:49:20,656
Maybe now I am talking fast or seem nervous but in emergency I can think under pressure.

413
00:49:20,807 --> 00:49:32,941
– At this moment do you consider yourself as being calm or trying to control yourself?

414
00:49:33,507 --> 00:49:43,181
– I feel a little a little bit fluttery, shaky. I don’t know.

415
00:49:43,661 --> 00:49:51,376
If there’s something apprehensive about something I can shake,

416
00:49:51,627 --> 00:49:53,564
perhaps it’s not visible to someone else

417
00:49:53,664 --> 00:49:54,744
but I know because I get a cup of tea

418
00:49:55,024 --> 00:50:01,528
and I’ll be going like this have to pull myself and it will pass. Not very often.

419
00:50:04,023 --> 00:50:08,868
– Can you speak easily in front of people?
– It depends.

420
00:50:08,968 --> 00:50:16,823
If it is something I believe in, in informal situations I can talk forever.

421
00:50:17,064 --> 00:50:26,788
But formal situations... I haven’t practiced on that.

422
00:50:27,304 --> 00:50:34,468
I’m pretty open with people. I will openly talk about many subjects.

423
00:50:37,544 --> 00:50:49,064
– You didn’t say anything about the father. Good relationship?

424
00:50:51,383 --> 00:50:56,503
– My father is 81, he is Polish, and he is very strong constitution.

425
00:50:56,744 --> 00:50:58,788
He’s a really good person.

426
00:51:00,343 --> 00:51:06,468
I’ve realized as I got older my mother dominates this relationship

427
00:51:06,984 --> 00:51:10,067
and unfortunately he doesn’t speak up for himself.

428
00:51:10,308 --> 00:51:12,104
I get very angry with him.

429
00:51:12,378 --> 00:51:14,423
Recently, this is an issue for me,

430
00:51:14,664 --> 00:51:19,784
he doesn’t react and then he says to me why is this and why is that

431
00:51:20,058 --> 00:51:24,024
and he doesn’t do anything about it and he is so capable.

432
00:51:29,018 --> 00:51:35,403
I get angry for him sometimes. I get angry at my mother for him.

433
00:51:38,984 --> 00:51:43,828
– Do you want to hit your mother when something like this happens?

434
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,940
– I have actually recently hit her twice and I’ve never done that before.

435
00:51:48,186 --> 00:51:51,780
I’ve slapped her twice. I felt bad for myself.

436
00:51:52,026 --> 00:51:59,970
After many many years I realized how in a way she undermines,

437
00:52:00,224 --> 00:52:06,624
criticizes and dominated my father.

438
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:13,488
It was almost on behalf of both of us and I know it’s not the right thing to do.

439
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:17,600
– You were impulsive.

440
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:23,828
– Impulsive but I couldn’t also apologize for it after because it was a true what I felt.

441
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:31,010
Perhaps I shouldn’t. I know maybe it’s perhaps of her illness.

442
00:52:31,264 --> 00:52:49,184
She can say some very hurtful things.
– Well, thank you!

443
00:52:53,540 --> 00:53:04,026
Do you all agree that in the beginning the interview was jerky?

444
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:14,928
Who agrees with that? Let me see how many people agree.

445
00:53:15,028 --> 00:53:21,946
How many people agree with what Margit was saying that in the beginning of the interview

446
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:31,940
she was quite in a state of not calmness, she was too excitable, jerky.

447
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:41,410
And eventually she calmed down.

448
00:53:41,908 --> 00:53:46,530
It was a difficult interview

449
00:53:46,630 --> 00:54:03,066
because there was a excitement which can easily go overboard

450
00:54:03,584 --> 00:54:15,868
unless you know how to handle it so people can feel more confident and comfortable

451
00:54:16,653 --> 00:54:32,013
so this excessive excitement will calm down and they will able to express more.

452
00:54:33,293 --> 00:54:40,188
This was one these cases where in the beginning she was quite excited,

453
00:54:41,853 --> 00:54:51,983
not able to put her thoughts into a very coherent route

454
00:54:52,344 --> 00:55:06,573
but eventually she became much calmer and showed her real character.

455
00:55:06,824 --> 00:55:15,266
There was a possibility of misunderstanding in the beginning concerning the mental state

456
00:55:17,583 --> 00:55:28,066
and eventually things became calmer.

457
00:55:33,453 --> 00:55:45,224
Concerning the remedy I have to say only a few things.

458
00:55:46,748 --> 00:55:56,226
The remedy that was really the correct was Stram.

459
00:55:56,493 --> 00:56:04,943
and should have been given in even a higher potency.

460
00:56:05,186 --> 00:56:07,228
There is no question about that.

461
00:56:07,503 --> 00:56:15,426
The next remedy which acted was Aur.

462
00:56:16,188 --> 00:56:25,423
But it acted because she took 2 wrong remedies before

463
00:56:25,666 --> 00:56:36,424
that brought her into the state of Aur. Anac. and Plat. were wrong prescriptions to the extent

464
00:56:36,668 --> 00:56:40,264
that she was brought into that state.

465
00:56:41,293 --> 00:56:50,504
Got Aur. herself and somebody gave her Plat. afterwards due to the fact,

466
00:56:50,748 --> 00:56:56,143
most probably, that was relating this experience,

467
00:56:56,386 --> 00:57:02,543
what she was doing sleeping with different people, changing partners.

468
00:57:04,813 --> 00:57:09,066
But this is not a case of Plat.

469
00:57:09,305 --> 00:57:15,980
Because a Plat. is not going out of curiosity

470
00:57:16,746 --> 00:57:24,665
but out of real need for sexual intercourse.

471
00:57:25,455 --> 00:57:31,855
When Plat. is stimulated on this level there is an absolute need

472
00:57:32,106 --> 00:57:37,226
to have a kind of release on this level

473
00:57:37,465 --> 00:57:44,906
and the release doesn’t come that means the orgasm is not deep enough,

474
00:57:45,145 --> 00:57:50,265
it’s a superficial orgasm, which doesn’t satisfy deeply

475
00:57:50,540 --> 00:58:00,015
and there is a constant need for a stimulation and again superficial orgasm etc.

476
00:58:00,266 --> 00:58:12,300
They can 5-10 orgasms in a day without being happy and satisfied.

477
00:58:12,548 --> 00:58:14,095
This was not the case.

478
00:58:15,865 --> 00:58:22,540
She said I was going out to find out why others were doing this,

479
00:58:22,788 --> 00:58:27,385
I also want to do it. But she said I felt nothing.

480
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:32,505
Forget Plat. in such a case.

481
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:40,185
A woman can go with 50 men in a few days and is not Plat.

482
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:52,495
if she goes out of curiosity or as an ego booster.

483
00:58:58,105 --> 00:59:05,295
What shall we do in such case?

484
00:59:18,585 --> 00:59:39,588
Let me see how many people say to give Stram. same potency. Stram. higher potency?

485
00:59:40,106 --> 01:00:13,900
A new remedy? 6. Wait? 1. What new remedy would you give?

486
01:00:14,148 --> 01:00:17,465
– Sep.
– Med.

487
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:34,380
– Hyos.
– Thuja.

488
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:48,975
– What is happening is like this;

489
01:00:56,140 --> 01:01:11,225
after Stram. she had several wrong remedies and she had Aur. which balanced again the organism

490
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:26,860
because it was going suddenly to the wrong direction and Zinc. she said I feel something going on.

491
01:01:27,108 --> 01:01:42,220
– I gave the Zinc. My observation is that it has helped as she says she is very fidgety, always moving.

492
01:01:42,468 --> 01:01:44,266
And this has calmed down.

493
01:01:44,505 --> 01:01:49,625
– You think it had an effect.

494
01:01:55,786 --> 01:02:02,186
This is how a homeopath should analyze this case.

495
01:02:03,705 --> 01:02:09,867
The patient reports that Stram. was very good. Never repeated.

496
01:02:11,908 --> 01:02:17,960
And then she comes to the point as we said Aur. and then back again

497
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:22,541
but still in a fidgety state as Ernest is saying,

498
01:02:22,784 --> 01:02:56,064
gives Zinc. 200C 1 year ago and there was some calming effect still you cannot say

499
01:02:56,587 --> 01:03:06,727
that all these remedies after Stram. had done something substantial except of Aur.

500
01:03:06,827 --> 01:03:14,407
that was after Plat. the case was aggravated without curative effect.

501
01:03:14,507 --> 01:03:23,706
This is the case where we have aggravation without curative effect and Aur. brought her back.

502
01:03:23,981 --> 01:03:31,661
If we do proper analysis we have to say this;

503
01:03:31,904 --> 01:03:42,844
that this case having  Stram. very positive effect we have to repeat this

504
01:03:45,741 --> 01:03:53,664
to see if can take further the case.

505
01:03:53,936 --> 01:04:00,848
The problem is, what you have to ask yourself,

506
01:04:00,948 --> 01:04:10,106
is whether the Stram. picture is coming back or it started coming back.

507
01:04:11,904 --> 01:04:28,026
Are we sure that Stram. picture is coming back? It’s not clear at all.

508
01:04:28,301 --> 01:04:34,944
I tried to investigate the issue of Stram.

509
01:04:35,216 --> 01:04:45,707
with the darkness, aggression, the hatred, the violence.

510
01:04:45,946 --> 01:05:00,026
Apart from this incident in which she slapped her mother which she feels it was an act of justice for her,

511
01:05:00,301 --> 01:05:08,747
not of injustice because her mother is torturing her father

512
01:05:08,986 --> 01:05:21,296
according to what she understood and somebody had to do something so she did it.

513
01:05:28,976 --> 01:05:38,426
We are justified to repeat the remedy when we have a relapse

514
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:43,821
or quite a good picture of the remedy again.

515
01:05:44,064 --> 01:05:48,176
Even if the pathology is not as deep as before.

516
01:05:48,427 --> 01:05:52,506
But you have to have the keynotes of the remedy

517
01:05:52,781 --> 01:06:00,876
before you can expect to have an effect on this case.

518
01:06:00,976 --> 01:06:08,907
I tried to find out whether the keynotes are coming back.

519
01:06:09,146 --> 01:06:20,427
A big keynote is the fear of the dark. Another keynote is nightmares.

520
01:06:20,666 --> 01:06:24,016
You remember the previous case with the nightmares,

521
01:06:24,267 --> 01:06:27,066
and these nightmares, Stram. nightmares?

522
01:06:29,387 --> 01:06:40,384
She had similar nightmares with her. Similar stories and pictures.

523
01:06:40,907 --> 01:06:46,027
The nightmares are not there, the fear of darkness is not there,

524
01:06:46,266 --> 01:06:48,826
the violence is not there, she is quite happy

525
01:06:49,101 --> 01:06:58,827
and what she says from time to time I get into the feeling that maybe I will do something,

526
01:06:59,066 --> 01:07:09,824
I will make a wrong decision, fear of disaster, fear that I will bring a disaster in my life.

527
01:07:10,347 --> 01:07:16,747
Give the repertorization which you did...

528
01:07:54,896 --> 01:08:33,296
So the repertorization will again show Stram. 20 out 25 symptoms.

529
01:08:33,547 --> 01:08:38,144
It has a lot of symptoms.

530
01:08:39,181 --> 01:08:47,866
Most of you will give a higher potency of Stram., correct?

531
01:09:06,827 --> 01:09:13,024
– Hyosc. is the only remedy with fear of being betrayed.

532
01:09:15,787 --> 01:09:22,106
Knowing more about the situation with her mother,

533
01:09:22,381 --> 01:09:27,226
she must have a feeling that her mother goes against her so much.

534
01:09:27,756 --> 01:09:33,908
This is a strong consideration for Hyos.

535
01:09:36,468 --> 01:09:42,106
Feeling of  being betrayed, self-betrayal.

536
01:09:42,624 --> 01:09:48,260
– The problem is that when you prescribe a remedy

537
01:09:48,506 --> 01:09:54,906
especially in a sensitive case of that type you have to base your prescription in something really solid.

538
01:09:55,170 --> 01:10:00,544
So the most solid appears to be Stram.

539
01:10:00,788 --> 01:10:09,504
but not solid enough and that should make you cautious.

540
01:10:09,748 --> 01:10:17,428
The next question you have to ask do we have another remedy

541
01:10:17,700 --> 01:10:24,610
which is quite solid and quite indicated in her case?

542
01:10:25,108 --> 01:10:35,348
And if you put that question, what is the answer?

543
01:10:37,526 --> 01:10:49,601
Excuse me eating but we are not going to have an interval and my energy is going down.

544
01:10:49,701 --> 01:10:59,127
Tell me. No answer. The answer is no.

545
01:10:59,227 --> 01:11:05,791
We don’t have an alternative at this case.

546
01:11:05,891 --> 01:11:13,207
We don’t have Hyosc., Zinc., Puls., Calc.

547
01:11:13,307 --> 01:11:19,971
We don’t have something solid to prescribe upon.

548
01:11:20,747 --> 01:11:26,583
Therefore unfortunately in this case you have the right answer

549
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:29,143
(you can experiment with whatever you like)

550
01:11:29,384 --> 01:11:50,528
is wait until you have more confirmation for Stram.,

551
01:11:50,628 --> 01:11:59,863
most probably, or for another remedy.

552
01:12:00,104 --> 01:12:06,504
In this situation where she says 90% of the time I am happy,

553
01:12:07,778 --> 01:12:16,460
given the fact that she has been through hell, quite a lot,

554
01:12:16,708 --> 01:12:32,068
being an Stram. for more than 10 years,

555
01:12:33,605 --> 01:12:41,028
because this is one of the remedies that is not very pleasant being in that state of Stram.

556
01:12:41,295 --> 01:12:47,946
And the fact she says everything that happens to me is on a mental/ emotional level,

557
01:12:48,185 --> 01:12:52,548
not on the physical, so she has been suffering quite a lot in the mental/ emotional level,

558
01:12:52,815 --> 01:12:57,145
given the fact that her mother has some problem on these levels,

559
01:12:57,245 --> 01:13:01,508
we have to be very careful on how we prescribe on such a case.

560
01:13:01,775 --> 01:13:17,900
You see Plat. took her off! It’s not a case on which you can experiment and give a remedy.

561
01:13:22,745 --> 01:13:27,626
You can give a remedy and see what happens, you can do that of course

562
01:13:27,865 --> 01:13:36,068
and then your best guess would be Stram.

563
01:13:52,335 --> 01:13:51,547
but I am not sure that at this moment Stram. would not have an aggravation without an amelioration.

564
01:13:51,822 --> 01:13:58,222
Then what happens is especially when you’re not experienced homeopath

565
01:13:58,732 --> 01:14:05,388
you immediately jump into counteracting this by different other remedies

566
01:14:05,627 --> 01:14:11,196
and as a result you find yourself in a bad situation

567
01:14:11,468 --> 01:14:19,662
because it’s not producing a picture.

568
01:14:19,905 --> 01:14:28,865
What would be the picture if after Stram. in 1996 and she come to us 5 years later

569
01:14:29,132 --> 01:14:33,742
and says I want to be treated,

570
01:14:33,985 --> 01:14:42,188
it’s my impression, now we would be able to find more easily the remedy,

571
01:14:42,427 --> 01:14:48,827
either a new remedy or a Stram. to be as relapse case.

572
01:14:48,927 --> 01:14:58,967
Now, it’s difficult because of the interference of the other remedies.

573
01:14:59,067 --> 01:15:10,348
And therefore taking a chance to prescribe a remedy at this moment is really taking a chance!

574
01:15:11,642 --> 01:15:16,626
– I would like to know when she gets in those states which she described,

575
01:15:16,898 --> 01:15:24,824
which are very seldom does she then have any Stram. signs like fear of dark?

576
01:15:25,347 --> 01:15:31,747
– No, I don’t get that but it’s more paralyzing.

577
01:15:31,858 --> 01:15:41,218
I cannot think usually. That’s the overwhelming sensation.

578
01:15:41,711 --> 01:15:46,584
But the dark is not a problem.

579
01:15:46,831 --> 01:15:53,231
– She seems to have a paralysis of her will, that she cannot decide,

580
01:15:53,507 --> 01:16:08,098
is afraid to make a decision or the decision may bring about a kind of disaster whatever it might be.

581
01:16:13,218 --> 01:16:24,847
I was not able to make a decision and given the fact that she says 98% of the time

582
01:16:24,947 --> 01:16:32,627
I feel good we have the luxury to say wait.

583
01:16:32,868 --> 01:16:38,504
So the right answer was given by only 1 person...

584
01:16:52,068 --> 01:17:04,627
This shows the real problem that we are facing each time with Homeopathy.

585
01:17:04,868 --> 01:17:11,784
It shows really that things aren’t easy and you have to put a lot together

586
01:17:12,058 --> 01:17:17,427
before you come to the right decision.

587
01:17:19,464 --> 01:17:24,584
And the decision is always when you really benefit the patient.

588
01:17:24,858 --> 01:17:34,308
All others are theory. And the theory is in order to support the patient.

589
01:17:34,583 --> 01:17:38,148
It’s not like we like to have a theory.

590
01:17:38,423 --> 01:17:47,427
The theoretical parts and the laws are in order to be able to make this kind of decisions.

591
01:17:47,938 --> 01:17:52,024
Unless we have some rules to make these decision...

592
01:17:55,346 --> 01:18:02,787
I could tell 2 or 3 rules... It’s not like that.

593
01:18:03,026 --> 01:18:14,307
It’s a whole understanding of the theory, the M.M., the pathology,

594
01:18:14,546 --> 01:18:25,551
the understanding how serious a case is, how deep it is, where it belongs to,

595
01:18:25,727 --> 01:18:30,424
should you touch it, should you stimulate...

596
01:18:39,138 --> 01:18:49,378
I understand your difficulties but these are the facts.
