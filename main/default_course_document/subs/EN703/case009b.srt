1
00:00:19,193 --> 00:00:31,074
This case, a year ago received Puls. 10M and according to this report,

2
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:41,980
a big and deep change started the same day almost with Puls. 10M.

3
00:00:42,564 --> 00:00:46,271
You can see in my first and second letter that a very deep healing process

4
00:00:46,684 --> 00:00:51,156
started from that day and has continued until today.

5
00:00:52,937 --> 00:00:58,009
The fax is on the 13th of March 2001.

6
00:00:58,576 --> 00:01:04,531
"I have a feeling that my picture has changed so please do not stop prescribing, etc."

7
00:01:11,651 --> 00:01:17,652
So, I would like to see what is the situation, where is it now?

8
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:24,865
- How it is today or shall I tell you what changes I had?

9
00:01:26,105 --> 00:01:32,771
- Yes, you can give me the changes and then you tell me how it is today.

10
00:01:33,201 --> 00:01:40,433
Straight away after Puls. the cramp in uterus, bladder and rectum was gone,

11
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:54,342
and after that also I had even more headache, I had a headache almost every day,

12
00:01:55,248 --> 00:02:02,296
for I don't know how long. I was here in Alonnisos, I had headache all the time,

13
00:02:02,647 --> 00:02:05,368
I couldn't sit in the class, I had to go out sometimes.

14
00:02:05,886 --> 00:02:17,117
And also I took the Puls. here at the course, and here in Alonnisos...

15
00:02:17,627 --> 00:02:20,242
- But you had an aggravation of the headache
- Yes

16
00:02:20,502 --> 00:02:25,155
- It was worse these days
- Yes, it was worse

17
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:35,797
and also it was my feelings that I was talking about, from my childhood, about...

18
00:02:39,369 --> 00:02:43,751
- Shall I read the report that you have sent me?

19
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:53,108
You say in your report, "on May 24th, the same day I got the remedy,

20
00:02:53,902 --> 00:03:00,034
I had a much stronger headache, and gradually subsided during one week".

21
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:03,979
So for one week you had aggravation of the headache.

22
00:03:04,231 --> 00:03:09,922
"I was swollen in my face, hands and feet. I felt sick and drained of energy.

23
00:03:10,294 --> 00:03:15,006
My headache moved from the right side of my head to the left side.

24
00:03:15,485 --> 00:03:24,155
The bleeding was reduced and on the 26th of May I started to get eczema

25
00:03:24,609 --> 00:03:32,373
on my fingers and on the hollow of my knees. My headache were diminishing

26
00:03:33,585 --> 00:03:40,525
and I had constipation which I had as a teenager".

27
00:03:40,943 --> 00:03:47,537
- For a period of time you had it...
- Yes, through childhood and as a teenager

28
00:03:47,903 --> 00:03:54,839
"On the 27th of May, still reduced bleeding, feeling of lack of confidence and worthlessness".

29
00:03:55,257 --> 00:03:59,786
- Yes, that got worse here, in Alonnisos, much worse.

30
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:06,766
- "Feelings that I continuously had earlier in my life. And the headache eventually disappeared.

31
00:04:07,162 --> 00:04:15,459
On the 3rd of June suddenly weeping and feeling worthless especially when comparing with other people.

32
00:04:16,084 --> 00:04:23,228
The menstruation is small but does not stop completely, although the period should be over.

33
00:04:24,434 --> 00:04:29,375
On the 5th of June, ultrasonic gynecological examination at the hospital

34
00:04:29,732 --> 00:04:44,305
revealed a 2cm big submucosal myoma in my uterus. On the 13th of June, my menstruation came 6 days early.

35
00:04:44,783 --> 00:04:51,573
On 15 of June, constantly depressed and despondent, which I was earlier in my whole life.

36
00:04:51,837 --> 00:05:07,267
It went away during my education, I had psychosynthesis with Assagioli. August 99 to May 2000.

37
00:05:07,658 --> 00:05:11,879
During the menstruation that began on the 13th of June, I had no cramps

38
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:22,520
in my urinary bladder, uterus or rectum. The blood was less clotted, the color was more bright red.

39
00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:28,551
On the 3rd of July, still small bleeding, the menstruation does not stop completely,

40
00:05:28,882 --> 00:05:37,508
eczema on forearms is much better, on finger it disappeared, no headache during this menstruation.

41
00:05:37,742 --> 00:05:47,019
Since June 2000, my appetite has changed. I like meat, I need meat, I eat meat but not the fat parts.

42
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:53,111
Earlier I did not like meat except for shellfish, fish and chicken.

43
00:05:53,412 --> 00:05:59,883
My dreams have changed before the 24th of May, weeping in dreams because of feelings

44
00:06:00,118 --> 00:06:10,595
of being forsaken and outsider feelings. After taking Puls. my dreams have changed,

45
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:19,942
I have not had any such dreams. And the abdomen is not so bloated after eating."

46
00:06:23,254 --> 00:06:26,301
- So, you can continue from there.
- Yes, right.

47
00:06:31,674 --> 00:06:41,995
I still have this stiff neck, very much, and shoulders. I still cry very easily,

48
00:06:42,222 --> 00:06:52,933
like I read the newspaper and start to cry, I easily cry. And I have still my dreams, but not in the same way.

49
00:06:53,345 --> 00:07:03,060
It's a dream about a very-very deep sadness, only a sadness, I don't know what kind of sadness,

50
00:07:03,746 --> 00:07:21,190
but I wake up crying. And I still very often wake up with dry eyes, I'm still pressing my teeth when sleeping.

51
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:27,365
- Pressing or grinding?
- No, pressing.

52
00:07:28,141 --> 00:07:44,606
I have still very loose stool, and still my stomach swells when I'm eating, I want food

53
00:07:45,037 --> 00:07:50,790
but it's very unpleasant when I have this. And I still swell everywhere,

54
00:07:51,114 --> 00:07:56,582
my breasts, the whole body, my mind, everything is swelling up before menses.

55
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:11,634
But I've never had migraines, I'm so happy about that, and my eczema is gone. I still sleep with my hands over the head...

56
00:08:13,157 --> 00:08:20,620
-You still sleep like that? Because there was a period where you did not sleep in that position.

57
00:08:21,736 --> 00:08:31,204
-Yes that was a period, and it came back. Also I was eating meat suddenly. I don't want that now.

58
00:08:31,471 --> 00:08:34,986
- Now you don't want meat?
- Not at all

59
00:08:35,442 --> 00:08:41,744
- And you don't want fish?
- I can eat fish, but I prefer not.

60
00:08:42,878 --> 00:08:56,877
What's new is that I have no sexual desire since... it started in August last year slowly,

61
00:08:57,549 --> 00:09:04,975
with the depressions and so on, then this thing comes, and it still is very much so.

62
00:09:06,144 --> 00:09:11,984
And it also is, that I have no desire for nothing. I'm still depressed, in a way.

63
00:09:12,544 --> 00:09:20,327
I don't know if it's depression but I have a heavy mood all the time, I have existential crisis inside,

64
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:32,025
more or less all the time. And I have a feeling inside myself that I'm empty, I'm not alive,

65
00:09:32,429 --> 00:09:42,969
not really alive, because nothing motivates me, I don't want any special food, any special drinks,

66
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:51,404
I don't want my sex life. Everything has changed, it's all going down on that level.

67
00:09:51,954 --> 00:10:03,061
Other things is much better. And what's new also is that my hands are swelling up when I'm out walking,

68
00:10:04,948 --> 00:10:08,740
and that is strange. And they go stiff.

69
00:10:09,046 --> 00:10:12,862
- Do you like to walk?
- Yes, I love it.

70
00:10:13,033 --> 00:10:16,038
- So there is one thing that you love.
- Yeah! That's true

71
00:10:16,962 --> 00:10:20,381
- You walk fast or you like to walk slowly?
- I like to go slow.

72
00:10:24,318 --> 00:10:32,918
And what's also new and is very strange is that, when I'm talking I have a lock, here in my right ear.

73
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:40,532
- As if the ear is blocked?

74
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:47,209
- Yes, I hear my voice inside the head all the time, when I am talking, but it doesn't bother me

75
00:10:47,587 --> 00:11:03,043
when other people are talking, it's here on the right side. And that is new, I had it for a month,

76
00:11:03,563 --> 00:11:19,666
I think. And what's new also is I have all the time feeling that my teeth are cracking,

77
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:24,521
when I'm eating I have to check if they are OK suddenly.

78
00:11:24,746 --> 00:11:26,895
- As if cracking, as if breaking...

79
00:11:27,452 --> 00:11:37,445
- Yes, suddenly I have a feeling like, oh, they are broken. So I'm a little bit scared when I'm eating.

80
00:11:40,677 --> 00:11:50,749
And also what's a bit stronger now is my intuition, it's stronger than before.

81
00:11:54,247 --> 00:12:09,277
- The blood has stopped?
- No, it's much better, but the pattern is I think the same,

82
00:12:09,575 --> 00:12:18,923
because before I had 13-14 days of menstruation and it was very-very heavy about 7-8 days.

83
00:12:19,342 --> 00:12:32,712
Now I still have 10-11 days of menstruation, but it starts normally, I have too much bleeding

84
00:12:33,132 --> 00:12:39,259
for about 4 days, and then it's going down and it can't stop really.

85
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:45,619
- It can't stop till the next?
- No, not really. Yes, it will stop but it takes so long time.

86
00:12:47,456 --> 00:12:55,070
- But the actual amount is less now, because before it was 6-7 days very heavy,

87
00:12:55,379 --> 00:13:02,887
now it's 4 days heavy bleeding and another 7 days slight bleeding.

88
00:13:03,058 --> 00:13:10,221
- Yes, and sometimes not really bleeding, but there is...
- Sometimes leucorrhoea?

89
00:13:10,547 --> 00:13:19,203
- Something, there is red blood but it's not the menstruation really, it won't stop, that's the feeling.

90
00:13:19,447 --> 00:13:29,065
- The color, what is the color? It's brownish or what? After the first 4 days?

91
00:13:29,511 --> 00:13:36,631
- When it's trying to stop?
- Yes, before it stops.

92
00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:41,215
- Then it's normal red.

93
00:13:41,871 --> 00:13:51,851
- You have 4 days heavy bleeding, red. After the 4 days you have a little bit.

94
00:13:52,235 --> 00:14:02,370
- Yes, but it's still menstruation, but in the end, it's turning to be something brownish.

95
00:14:04,763 --> 00:14:10,123
- Is there any specific odor?
- No, nothing.

96
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:19,626
- After the bleeding, is there any kind of leucorrhoea, discharge?
- No.

97
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:33,762
Also what's new is that I have a kind of restlessness. That's not me, usually in that way,

98
00:14:34,393 --> 00:14:40,562
I don't like it when the day goes on the same and the week goes the same.

99
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:44,938
Suddenly I want things to change, and that's very new for me.

100
00:14:45,393 --> 00:14:55,762
- Very unusual you mean?
- Yes. And in a way I like it, but I also don't know how to handle it.

101
00:14:58,362 --> 00:15:06,153
- Is this a feeling that you are bored and things must change, or is it a feeling of hurriedness?

102
00:15:06,465 --> 00:15:15,841
- No, not hurriedness, I never feel in a hurry. I'm still this calm person. Yes, that's also new,

103
00:15:16,138 --> 00:15:27,673
I don't have that temper like in the other interview in 2000, I was getting angry suddenly, and I don't now.

104
00:15:32,857 --> 00:15:42,776
- Do you tolerate heat good or bad?
- No, I don't want heat, I can't breathe in the class.

105
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:53,920
- It's too stuffy for you
- Not stuffy, but it's bad air, it stands still, I want fresh air

106
00:15:56,749 --> 00:16:08,174
- Anything else?
- What's gone also is today I feel my limits, before I didn't feel my limits,

107
00:16:09,446 --> 00:16:15,238
I always did too much and then I go down, I feel my limits.

108
00:16:15,869 --> 00:16:20,981
- And you can say, I don't want anymore?
- Yes, I can say Stop! and that is very good.

109
00:16:21,925 --> 00:16:32,541
The eczema didn't go so bad as I thought it should. You told me last year that the eczema

110
00:16:32,964 --> 00:16:41,453
with Puls. 10M would come back, it did, but I have never had eczema on the whole body.

111
00:16:41,989 --> 00:16:47,453
I thought it would come back much more.

112
00:16:47,813 --> 00:16:58,429
- It came but not enough, that is the impression.
- I don't know if it should be more, but I was thinking it should.

113
00:17:04,188 --> 00:17:15,983
But now I'm very tired of feeling like this. I had enough for myself.

114
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:33,628
I don't want to feel this heavyness and emptiness. And it's terrible that my sexual drive is gone.

115
00:17:35,994 --> 00:17:41,998
It used to be very good for the first time in my life.

116
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:52,480
- And why do you think this happened? Are there any external reasons for that according to you?

117
00:17:52,867 --> 00:18:01,626
- I've been depressed so long, something to do with that, and the bleeding, I was very tired of it..

118
00:18:01,908 --> 00:18:11,186
- When you took the psychotherapy? The Assagioli therapy?
- I'm making education, yes?

119
00:18:16,823 --> 00:18:24,293
- What do you mean? You are educating yourself or you're educating others?

120
00:18:24,633 --> 00:18:29,064
- I am going in the school...

121
00:18:29,478 --> 00:18:33,439
- To educate yourself
- Yes.

122
00:18:33,692 --> 00:18:44,377
- But Assagioli, as far as I know is psychosynthesis, that's what they call it. Are you still going now?

123
00:18:44,562 --> 00:18:48,395
- Yes, I have one more year left.

124
00:18:49,220 --> 00:19:00,596
- And during this period you are applying some of these principles to yourself?
- Yes, of course.

125
00:19:06,564 --> 00:19:17,548
- Did it cross your mind that maybe what you had, this bleeding, and the myoma, it might be cancer?

126
00:19:17,801 --> 00:19:27,812
- It is not cancer, I checked that. I did an operation, did I write that?
- No.

127
00:19:28,097 --> 00:19:57,745
- In October 2000 they took away one polypous, about 1-2 cm, but I still have a myoma 1-2 cm and I don't want to do any...

128
00:19:58,872 --> 00:20:06,488
- Did it cross your mind that it might be cancer?
- Yes

129
00:20:06,867 --> 00:20:20,300
- And did this idea affect you? Did you say "Oh God, I cannot have a child,

130
00:20:20,658 --> 00:20:27,066
and my uterus will be gone" and things like that.

131
00:20:27,413 --> 00:20:45,837
- I was thinking about death, and the whole life from childhood up to about 1997,

132
00:20:46,565 --> 00:20:56,400
I didn't want to live. But then it changed and I want to do that. When you asked these questions,

133
00:20:56,788 --> 00:21:03,432
and I was thinking about cancer, then I thought "Am I going to die? I don't want to die now".

134
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:08,616
That's what I was thinking.

135
00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:19,108
- During previous years, when you were depressed, you had attempted suicide?

136
00:21:19,934 --> 00:21:23,913
- You asked me that before, and I had said no, but I've been thinking about it,

137
00:21:24,285 --> 00:21:38,609
and when I was about 15 I tried to take my life in a very naive way.

138
00:21:38,934 --> 00:21:52,835
It wasn't really serious, it was a shout for help. But I wouldn't do that now. Not at all.

139
00:21:54,778 --> 00:22:04,159
- Do you take a nap in the afternoon, sometimes?
- No, not at home. I do here.

140
00:22:04,743 --> 00:22:10,180
- How do you wake up after a nap? You wake up refreshed or unrefreshed?

141
00:22:10,506 --> 00:22:15,341
- Refreshed. I wake up refreshed in the morning too. I sleep very good.

142
00:22:15,892 --> 00:22:24,275
- Your sleep has changed after Puls. or it was always good?
- It was always good.

143
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:30,556
- And refreshed
- Yes, I like to go to sleep.

144
00:22:32,315 --> 00:22:37,093
- How much water you drink now?
- That is strange, I don't drink as much as before.

145
00:22:37,968 --> 00:22:40,998
- You drink less.
- Yes.

146
00:22:42,213 --> 00:22:49,114
- Your desire for sweets is less?
- I have no desire for nothing. No sweets, nothing.

147
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,639
- But you still eat it.
- Yes, I eat it.

148
00:22:53,085 --> 00:23:01,178
- You lost some weight?
- No, I would love to but it's difficult. I put on weight.

149
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:11,652
- This [.....] I would like to investigate this, why you took these injections?

150
00:23:12,146 --> 00:23:29,039
- Yes, I forgot to tell you. Sorry about that.
- Since December, you write here

151
00:23:30,593 --> 00:23:42,258
- Berberis D2, Ultrica Urens D3, that's a mixture of injections for the myoma. Anthroposophical injections.

152
00:23:42,938 --> 00:23:45,217
- You still take them?
- No.

153
00:23:45,676 --> 00:23:48,528
- How long did you take them?

154
00:23:48,894 --> 00:24:04,544
- I wrote it somewhere, I only had the Puls. at least, I think 8 or 9 months, nothing else,

155
00:24:05,257 --> 00:24:17,289
and then I started these injections, and then I stopped and then I started again, twice a week.

156
00:24:20,237 --> 00:24:48,751
And what also I can mention, I can feel in here something pinched me sometimes. I've been sighing very much.

157
00:24:53,322 --> 00:25:03,003
- Do you eat fruits? A lot?
- I eat every day. I like them. No special desire.

158
00:25:04,582 --> 00:25:12,094
- You like smoked meat...
- I don't eat meat at all.

159
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:15,940
- Before, you used to like smoked meat?

160
00:25:16,394 --> 00:25:27,630
- That period, when I was sending this fax to you, I ate meat, but no, I didn't take smoked meat.

161
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:37,798
- How long is now since you are sleeping again with the hands over your head?

162
00:25:40,073 --> 00:25:54,484
- Since the end of the winter. February, I'm not sure

163
00:25:54,978 --> 00:26:06,516
- You said that crying now is more easy.
- Yes, I think after Puls. that is more.

164
00:26:09,132 --> 00:26:15,474
- You cry more easily and more times?
- Both.

165
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:27,358
- You have to repeat Puls.
- I knew you would say that.

166
00:26:33,913 --> 00:26:51,037
- Take 1M and 10M. 1M the first day, 10M the second, and 10M the third. 2 times 10M,

167
00:26:51,589 --> 00:27:02,533
unless there is a reaction within the first day. If you take 1M and there is a reaction,

168
00:27:02,866 --> 00:27:10,521
you develop a headache, or an eczema, whatever reaction, you don't take any more.

169
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:18,558
But if there is nothing, no effect, the next day you take 10M, the other day, third day, another 10M.

170
00:27:20,249 --> 00:27:24,559
- I hope my husband is writing this down.

171
00:27:25,749 --> 00:27:40,664
- 1M the first day, the second day 10M and the third day 10M. Take it like this,

172
00:27:40,996 --> 00:27:47,411
and forget about the rest. 1M, 10M, 10M. Three days.
