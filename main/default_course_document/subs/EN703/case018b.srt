1
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:28,625
Here again is something which I have said many times that the correct remedy has been given

2
00:00:29,148 --> 00:00:36,577
but then it spoiled by several other remedies that are given wrongly.

3
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:43,985
This woman has been raped, she got a very big fright,

4
00:00:44,557 --> 00:00:52,188
she almost lost her mind and she started Ign., a little bit

5
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:58,065
and then some other remedies with no much effect

6
00:00:58,337 --> 00:01:03,185
and then she comes to the right remedy and she takes Stram.

7
00:01:08,305 --> 00:01:14,366
After Stram. she will develop certain things.

8
00:01:14,466 --> 00:01:19,626
Nobody can be 100% well after the remedy.

9
00:01:19,865 --> 00:01:25,027
You have some things but you have to evaluate the amelioration

10
00:01:25,302 --> 00:01:28,008
against the new things that are developing.

11
00:01:28,108 --> 00:01:33,497
If the amelioration is good you just don’t touch the case.

12
00:01:33,746 --> 00:01:43,304
So, all the other remedies after Stram. are mistakes.

13
00:01:43,548 --> 00:01:46,108
It doesn’t mean because she comes to you

14
00:01:46,626 --> 00:01:52,508
and as a homeopath that you have to give necessarily a remedy something

15
00:01:52,783 --> 00:01:56,623
which is the practice of almost everybody.

16
00:01:57,628 --> 00:02:01,643
Everybody thinks if I give a remedy now you will be much better.

17
00:02:01,743 --> 00:02:03,028
No. You have to evaluate.

18
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:08,048
That’s why I am taking it so carefully what happened... I took this and that.

19
00:02:08,148 --> 00:02:13,546
When did it happen? And then I see the gap 1993-1995 no remedies.

20
00:02:13,864 --> 00:02:21,495
That means this woman was peaceful inside. There is a big turmoil.

21
00:02:21,595 --> 00:02:30,945
Stram. is not a simple remedy, it has subconscious which is loaded with darkness.

22
00:02:31,225 --> 00:02:38,384
And when it goes away this darkness and aggression and the person is peaceful you wait.

23
00:02:41,406 --> 00:02:49,145
So even when she came here if you see the whole

24
00:02:49,386 --> 00:02:56,545
and then you see the analysis I came to the class and said no remedy.

25
00:02:56,825 --> 00:03:05,015
In spite of the fact she still says most of the time I don’t have these mood swings.

26
00:03:05,826 --> 00:03:11,664
I said wait because she is still in a quite good condition.

27
00:03:11,905 --> 00:03:15,255
Wait is the right prescription, not to give a remedy

28
00:03:15,504 --> 00:03:20,865
because she comes to the big master and the big master gives another remedy, no.

29
00:03:20,986 --> 00:03:23,305
It’s not like that.

30
00:03:24,985 --> 00:03:35,225
You don’t have to prescribe a remedy if the organism is in a state of balance.

31
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:39,306
Can it be better balanced?

32
00:03:39,575 --> 00:03:48,266
If you have a very clear picture you may try otherwise you must say wait.

33
00:03:48,335 --> 00:03:59,545
So the analysis of the case into the class was wait because she says 98% of the time I am well.

34
00:03:59,786 --> 00:04:03,895
2% of the time I may have this mood swings.

35
00:04:04,665 --> 00:04:15,226
Still the effect of Stram. from 5 years ago is there

36
00:04:15,501 --> 00:04:23,947
in spite of the fact its action has been reduced by several wrong remedies.

37
00:04:26,821 --> 00:04:29,148
That was the evaluation during that time,

38
00:04:29,412 --> 00:04:38,865
wait and we would like to see now what has happened after this waiting.

39
00:04:40,145 --> 00:04:50,657
Waited for 1 year with no remedy. Unless she has taken a remedy herself.

40
00:04:55,777 --> 00:05:03,972
Not necessarily if you take a remedy yourself is always wrong. It can be right.

41
00:05:07,948 --> 00:05:18,306
Last time I saw you we said no remedy and what happened after this.

42
00:05:18,545 --> 00:05:22,657
– I’d like to use a few notes.

43
00:05:24,706 --> 00:05:32,386
– Try to tell me whatever you remember and after you can consult your notes.

44
00:05:34,228 --> 00:05:44,145
– After I had no remedy I got quite an aggravation the same day.

45
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:55,426
Everything was amplified. It was very extreme.

46
00:05:56,188 --> 00:06:00,785
First I found it very disappointing that I didn’t get a remedy.

47
00:06:01,308 --> 00:06:04,786
– You got angry with me?
– Yes.

48
00:06:04,986 --> 00:06:11,427
Because I honestly thought that there was something that could help me.

49
00:06:11,948 --> 00:06:15,542
I understood the reasons why afterwards,

50
00:06:15,788 --> 00:06:19,797
I realized it was probably a good prescription not giving me a remedy

51
00:06:19,897 --> 00:06:22,540
but still felt there was something that could have helped.

52
00:06:22,888 --> 00:06:34,060
Makes things a little easier for me. The aggravation that I had was...

53
00:06:34,868 --> 00:06:38,708
I just came completely overwhelmed in the evening

54
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:45,349
and it was actually the evening of the party here and I got very emotional

55
00:06:45,624 --> 00:06:53,814
and an outburst, really upset, crying and I felt like my world had just collapsed.

56
00:06:54,068 --> 00:07:02,347
Everything had been taken away and I had a massive anxiety attack.

57
00:07:03,376 --> 00:07:07,706
Things that we have been talking about have been right to me...

58
00:07:07,981 --> 00:07:15,661
- Did you become violent?
– Yes and no. Nothing unusual.

59
00:07:20,016 --> 00:07:30,507
I feel sorry for my partner at the time, I got a bit nasty and really stormed off, really erratic.

60
00:07:31,021 --> 00:07:39,215
I just wanted to leave immediately. Unreasonable. I couldn’t reason my thoughts.

61
00:07:45,615 --> 00:07:56,106
I felt calmer the next day and what was unusual had four dreams in a row, four nights, four dreams.

62
00:07:56,345 --> 00:07:57,900
– Which were about?

63
00:07:58,148 --> 00:08:04,815
– The first, it was the first night I’d gone home to Manchester and it was a most unusual dream.

64
00:08:05,066 --> 00:08:13,260
I dreamed I was in Alonissos and I haven’t actually swam into the caves here in the bay

65
00:08:13,508 --> 00:08:19,385
but I dreamed I was swimming into the cave and it was beautiful,

66
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,455
everything was beautiful and sunny,

67
00:08:21,706 --> 00:08:29,135
I went in the cave then all of the sudden things changed and got dark

68
00:08:29,386 --> 00:08:33,740
and I was aware that the tide is coming in,

69
00:08:33,988 --> 00:08:40,140
a big tide and when I tried to get out of the cave I realized that I was trapped

70
00:08:40,388 --> 00:08:48,335
and my arm was trapped between two rocks and the more I tried to struggle

71
00:08:48,825 --> 00:08:56,505
the more I got worried I was going to drown, I couldn’t escape.

72
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:05,226
I paralyzed, the feeling I had, I couldn’t move and the tide was coming in.

73
00:09:05,465 --> 00:09:10,095
And I started to scream. I woke myself up screaming.

74
00:09:10,585 --> 00:09:15,705
Before I were caught I became well aware that my arm was trapped,

75
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:22,895
felt the water was coming over me and I realized my arm wasn’t trapped but I couldn’t move it.

76
00:09:23,385 --> 00:09:28,266
It wasn’t trapped but I couldn’t move it but I felt it was too late.

77
00:09:28,505 --> 00:09:36,708
I woke up then screaming. The next three nights I had a dream which was repetitive.

78
00:09:36,975 --> 00:09:42,585
I was in a car and although I was driving the first night,

79
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:52,425
I was going very fast and there was traffic approaching...

80
00:09:52,694 --> 00:09:54,985
I was definitely in the driver’s seat

81
00:09:55,254 --> 00:10:04,984
but I wasn’t controlling the car and this car was in front of me

82
00:10:05,225 --> 00:10:08,308
and I could see and I couldn’t do anything about it.

83
00:10:08,824 --> 00:10:15,224
I was going to crash and I felt paralyzed, I couldn’t do anything about it

84
00:10:16,504 --> 00:10:21,668
and I didn’t know I could do anything and then just before it happened I realized

85
00:10:21,907 --> 00:10:26,512
I was in the driver’s seat and I could have stopped it but I didn’t.

86
00:10:26,788 --> 00:10:29,587
And that was the time I woke up screaming.

87
00:10:29,859 --> 00:10:37,439
I had the same dream for two more nights but it was different each time.

88
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:45,219
The second I was driving again, same road, same obstacle came in front

89
00:10:45,465 --> 00:10:53,145
and this time I realized I was driving and I tried to lift my right leg to put it on the break

90
00:10:53,192 --> 00:10:58,788
and I couldn’t lift it and I started panicking cause I couldn’t lift my leg, so still paralyzed.

91
00:10:59,027 --> 00:11:01,587
And in the crash I woke up like it happens.

92
00:11:01,859 --> 00:11:10,050
On the last third of the repeated dream it was different. I was driving.

93
00:11:10,304 --> 00:11:15,568
This time I saw something approach, I knew I was driving,

94
00:11:15,668 --> 00:11:18,348
I knew I had to lift my leg to put on the break and I couldn’t

95
00:11:18,587 --> 00:11:23,468
and I was fighting to and I managed to lift my leg

96
00:11:23,982 --> 00:11:29,345
and I felt that I actually moved my leg and managed to stop it before it happened.

97
00:11:29,412 --> 00:11:36,782
That was the last time I had a dream. I haven’t had any dreams like that since.

98
00:11:36,825 --> 00:11:38,387
– You did not have any more dreams like that?

99
00:11:38,659 --> 00:11:43,546
– No. I went over what happened with these dreams.

100
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:48,666
I did think about them very deep because it was quite strong.

101
00:11:48,912 --> 00:11:52,682
I was interested it was all about realizing I thought I was trapped

102
00:11:52,782 --> 00:11:56,545
but I couldn't do something, I was paralyzed, I couldn’t move my arm and leg.

103
00:11:56,812 --> 00:12:03,707
And in the end I did. That was quite strong actually.

104
00:12:06,028 --> 00:12:15,745
Apart from that things have improved a lot and after that anxiety attack

105
00:12:16,782 --> 00:12:30,348
which happened here I’ve not had anything so strong and things have seemed to be a lot better.

106
00:12:34,188 --> 00:12:37,772
That was a strong feeling; paralyzed.

107
00:12:39,052 --> 00:12:42,382
What I have noticed and perhaps I didn’t mention it last year

108
00:12:42,692 --> 00:12:51,342
for a few years now I felt that my mind sometimes gets paralyzed as well.

109
00:12:55,948 --> 00:13:01,307
I sometimes if I had to make a decision I feel overwhelmed, paralyzed

110
00:13:01,825 --> 00:13:05,665
I won’t go with anything decision and I’ll just stay where I am knowing

111
00:13:05,932 --> 00:13:10,542
that it might be something smaller or large, I have been doing that recently, I’ve improved

112
00:13:10,785 --> 00:13:16,172
but now I realize in my thinking, at projects there are loads of things I wanted to do,

113
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:21,548
were piling up and don’t know where to start, so I wouldn’t start,

114
00:13:21,787 --> 00:13:27,692
I just look for new things to think about doing I wouldn’t deal with the things I have.

115
00:13:31,265 --> 00:13:38,702
– Then after July things were quite good?

116
00:13:39,212 --> 00:13:41,505
– Yes. I had a lot going on, as well.

117
00:13:41,772 --> 00:13:44,332
I think that helped me because I had so much I had to deal with.

118
00:13:45,345 --> 00:13:53,787
I didn’t have so much time to focus on worrying about not doing things.

119
00:14:02,252 --> 00:14:05,307
I did take a remedy myself.

120
00:14:05,582 --> 00:14:21,708
– When?
– I took it in October, I took Verat. 10M.

121
00:14:22,222 --> 00:14:25,687
– How did you feel after that?

122
00:14:25,787 --> 00:14:31,636
– I felt it did me well in a sense that in the back of my mind

123
00:14:31,736 --> 00:14:37,626
one of my biggest fears used to be I wanted to be strong mentally

124
00:14:37,867 --> 00:14:41,707
and because of my mother I always had a fear.

125
00:14:43,256 --> 00:14:47,586
And my mother was showing more and more signs of Verat.

126
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:54,868
and I just felt that underneath maybe there is a little root of that.

127
00:14:55,386 --> 00:15:02,548
Some my behavior in the past and my thinking could have easily developed into that kind of way.

128
00:15:04,346 --> 00:15:09,220
As I child I was a very big thinker.

129
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:14,586
– You used to think that  you may go crazy?
– Yes, that was very strong!

130
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:30,980
– And still it is a fear?
– No. That’s gone completely now. I feel very stable.

131
00:15:34,386 --> 00:15:48,384
The last 6 months I don’t feel vulnerable and emotionally unbalanced as I have been in the past.

132
00:15:48,628 --> 00:15:50,426
I feel I have got to another level.

133
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:58,624
– You feel you are much better than before.
– Yes.

134
00:15:58,868 --> 00:16:03,860
– Did you take another remedy?
– No. I took it once.

135
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:10,019
I have taken just one of the remedy but it was for a proving so I took it once.

136
00:16:10,265 --> 00:16:19,170
That was in February. It was an proving remedy that belongs to the lily family.

137
00:16:19,424 --> 00:16:26,465
Plant. I had symptoms but they seemed to come and go

138
00:16:26,745 --> 00:16:30,205
and I don’t think it was any detriment to taking...

139
00:16:30,305 --> 00:16:34,026
- Did you write down the symptoms during that time?

140
00:16:34,295 --> 00:16:39,146
– Yes. I have got some of the symptoms here.

141
00:16:45,025 --> 00:16:50,666
Did you mean with the remedy or the proving?
– Proving.

142
00:16:50,935 --> 00:16:55,265
– I felt very well on it, very relaxed.

143
00:16:56,766 --> 00:17:03,366
I was very calm and I didn’t repeat it like people in the proving did.

144
00:17:03,466 --> 00:17:06,977
I took it because I wanted to experience the atmosphere.

145
00:17:07,228 --> 00:17:10,545
– You did not belong to a group where you were doing the same thing?

146
00:17:10,817 --> 00:17:16,945
– Yes.
– Who was doing the proving?

147
00:17:17,017 --> 00:17:22,588
– It was through the college so I just wanted to take part to it, taking the remedy.

148
00:17:22,652 --> 00:17:28,988
But I don’t feel it was detrimental in any way.

149
00:17:30,017 --> 00:17:37,344
In fact it was interesting that I didn’t real I made the connection with Verat.

150
00:17:37,616 --> 00:17:41,184
and the remedy that belonged to the lily family.

151
00:17:43,226 --> 00:17:49,136
The only remedy I had was when I was away and I was quite ill

152
00:17:49,387 --> 00:18:14,586
when I was in Africa in February and that was Nux-v. 30C.

153
00:18:14,588 --> 00:18:17,192
I think I got 2 30C but it was good.

154
00:18:17,292 --> 00:18:22,145
It helped me physically and also in my state of mind.

155
00:18:30,587 --> 00:18:33,308
– Do you have any salivation during night?

156
00:18:34,237 --> 00:18:38,328
– No, I don’t now but I used to have.

157
00:18:38,428 --> 00:18:42,432
I went through a time for about 2 years when I was every night.

158
00:18:42,532 --> 00:18:47,906
But for the past 2 years I haven’t been having.

159
00:18:48,145 --> 00:18:54,817
– And it was quite strong before?
– Yes. It’s funny because I had never had it before.

160
00:18:55,068 --> 00:19:01,217
I noticed I had it for a 2-year period and never had it before then.

161
00:19:01,468 --> 00:19:03,820
– Where you having any treatment for your teeth then?

162
00:19:04,068 --> 00:19:06,895
 You had amalgam?
– No.

163
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,032
– Are you grinding your teeth at all?
– I don’t think so.

164
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:26,179
– You still need warm drinks or this is gone?

165
00:19:26,672 --> 00:19:34,105
– Yes. This is interesting, I still like warm drinks and I am still a chilly person

166
00:19:34,352 --> 00:19:36,666
but I am not as cold as I used to be.

167
00:19:37,184 --> 00:19:50,646
I used to be extremely cold, icy cold really, especially legs and arms.

168
00:19:50,746 --> 00:19:58,748
– But what about warm drinks?
– I love warm drinks. Even here I like hot drinks.

169
00:19:59,012 --> 00:20:03,106
I have occasionally water but I like coffees and teas.

170
00:20:07,185 --> 00:20:14,108
– That means you cannot drink cold drinks?
– I drink both.

171
00:20:14,626 --> 00:20:16,591
To be honest I can drink many drinks at the same time.

172
00:20:16,867 --> 00:20:21,711
I usually have a tea, a coffee and water at the same time.

173
00:20:22,498 --> 00:20:29,906
– You still drink coffee, tea?
– A lot.

174
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:32,587
– You do not know that if you drink coffee it antidotes?

175
00:20:32,826 --> 00:20:41,786
– I mean coffee substitutes. I’m not on an official remedy for a long time!

176
00:20:42,061 --> 00:20:43,341
– Are there official remedies?

177
00:20:43,856 --> 00:20:48,976
– I wasn’t prescribed a remedy. I do drink coffee but I drink it very weak.

178
00:20:49,266 --> 00:20:52,786
– How is your fear of the dark?
– It’s ok.

179
00:20:53,302 --> 00:20:56,867
– You don’t have much fear of the dark?
– No.

180
00:20:57,142 --> 00:20:59,948
– Fear of disaster?
– No.

181
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,777
– Fear of insanity, you said no. That’s gone.

182
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:11,737
– The desire to kill somebody? Are the impulses coming?

183
00:21:11,986 --> 00:21:15,826
– I don’t think I have that anymore.

184
00:21:17,347 --> 00:21:23,257
– It doesn’t come from time to time that you want just to throw things?

185
00:21:23,506 --> 00:21:29,142
– No. What I do get is I do get intolerant sometimes,

186
00:21:30,147 --> 00:21:34,777
I get annoyed of things that aren’t done properly.

187
00:21:38,617 --> 00:21:43,986
– This fear that you had not to be looked at?

188
00:21:47,308 --> 00:21:51,907
How is that fear? You did not want to be looked at.

189
00:21:52,946 --> 00:21:56,303
– It’s funny I never thought it since last year.

190
00:21:57,064 --> 00:22:00,653
I don’t think it’s there anymore.

191
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:08,066
– Sometimes getting malicious?
– I can be snappy.

192
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:11,663
What I have noticed, a big difference is that

193
00:22:12,173 --> 00:22:16,783
if I feel something I will say it quicker now, if I am upset will say something.

194
00:22:18,306 --> 00:22:33,933
And what I have been doing is that I do feel if something is bothering me I will talk about it.

195
00:22:34,184 --> 00:22:38,666
I’ll probably get snappy first, say something to get the storm off

196
00:22:38,905 --> 00:22:42,255
but I will come back and talk about it.

197
00:22:46,585 --> 00:22:54,788
– Are you awkward handling things? Dropping things...

198
00:22:55,545 --> 00:23:03,748
- I was for a while. I hadn’t noticed it recently but I did notice past 2 years.

199
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:09,539
Sometimes I felt a little bit disorientated. Uncoordinated sometimes.

200
00:23:11,065 --> 00:23:16,432
– Did you have some things dropping out of your hands?

201
00:23:23,347 --> 00:23:32,825
– It wasn’t that bad but I used to have a problem with picking something up.

202
00:23:33,348 --> 00:23:36,665
My mind would race ahead and was holding something else.

203
00:23:37,188 --> 00:23:42,032
My mind was too fast and I forget what I would do with something.

204
00:23:42,308 --> 00:23:44,868
I know it’s very common but I used to do that a lot.

205
00:23:45,872 --> 00:23:48,947
Had two thoughts at the same time.

206
00:23:49,988 --> 00:23:55,619
– Can I ask you something a little bit embarrassing?

207
00:24:02,338 --> 00:24:17,187
What am I going to ask you? Have you got any idea what I am going to ask you?

208
00:24:17,426 --> 00:24:21,538
– No, I don’t know.

209
00:24:21,584 --> 00:24:33,463
– Nothing comes to your mind?
– No.

210
00:24:35,258 --> 00:24:42,148
– I want ask you why you have your hair cut covering your face?

211
00:24:42,664 --> 00:24:50,618
Why do you think you have this hair style where your hair is covering your face?

212
00:24:50,867 --> 00:24:52,904
– I didn’t think I had actually!

213
00:24:55,738 --> 00:24:59,063
– It’s natural. It just falls by itself there?

214
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:07,507
You don’t comb your hair like this?

215
00:25:08,023 --> 00:25:12,905
– It is habit. I used to have a very big hobby of doing this.

216
00:25:18,264 --> 00:25:31,425
– But why are you doing that?
– I supposed to hide.

217
00:25:31,464 --> 00:25:43,461
– How long have you been having this hairstyle? Since you were 18 or 19?

218
00:25:43,707 --> 00:25:49,584
– It’s quite a long time. I used to put it up a lot and pull my hair back.

219
00:25:49,861 --> 00:25:57,787
I didn’t use to have a fringe.
– When did you change to that?

220
00:25:58,051 --> 00:26:05,221
– Probably it would be around then. 20sh maybe.

221
00:26:09,307 --> 00:26:14,427
– But do you remember this came together with some sexual desire

222
00:26:14,691 --> 00:26:21,091
which was increased during that time? You got more interested in boys?

223
00:26:22,464 --> 00:26:31,585
– Yes, probably around that time. Could be.
– What are your notes?

224
00:26:31,829 --> 00:26:44,901
– Basically it was just the remedies. I think I am much more focused on things.

225
00:26:45,665 --> 00:26:48,987
I still have this feeling.

226
00:26:49,505 --> 00:26:54,625
I can live with it but I believe it’s down, I can’t throw it off.

227
00:26:54,864 --> 00:27:00,771
I have this feeling sometimes that there is still a shadow looking,

228
00:27:01,025 --> 00:27:03,331
waiting sometimes for me to trip up,

229
00:27:04,504 --> 00:27:11,781
grab me back and pull me back to these heavy, dark days I was in.

230
00:27:12,027 --> 00:27:16,385
I don’t feel I have moods. I am not a moody person.

231
00:27:18,691 --> 00:27:22,531
Things are very good for me now,

232
00:27:22,624 --> 00:27:37,381
quite bright and happy but it’s like I allow sometimes thoughts of shadow.

233
00:27:37,891 --> 00:27:43,504
Just overwhelm me but it tries to make me think about the past

234
00:27:43,781 --> 00:27:47,621
and I don’t need I feel to think about the past...

235
00:27:56,304 --> 00:28:04,535
I spoke last year a lot about having to get things right and the fear of getting things right.

236
00:28:05,025 --> 00:28:08,865
I used to be frightened of not getting things perfectly right.

237
00:28:09,904 --> 00:28:11,946
And that’s has gone a lot.

238
00:28:12,464 --> 00:28:31,664
I feel a lot better but I still have this fear that any minute something could happen and be all finished.

239
00:28:31,905 --> 00:28:41,904
It can creep up me sometimes. It’s nowhere near where it used to be. Much better.

240
00:28:42,145 --> 00:28:49,335
But I was only thinking a month ago that it would be lovely to be rid of this feeling

241
00:28:49,584 --> 00:28:58,062
because it’s not needed anymore. It’s gone away so it’s not interfering with my life.

242
00:28:58,305 --> 00:29:01,902
But it just takes the edge of things sometimes.

243
00:29:02,668 --> 00:29:06,252
Commits me see for the negative.

244
00:29:06,508 --> 00:29:10,587
Worry that things are going to go wrong, unnecessarily sometimes.

245
00:29:14,912 --> 00:29:17,176
But I am really a very positive person.

246
00:29:17,425 --> 00:29:21,786
I am very happy with how things are going. I got a lot to do.

247
00:29:23,852 --> 00:29:27,182
But I always believed it’s possible to be 100% good,

248
00:29:27,425 --> 00:29:37,932
I don’t mean perfect but 100% right for yourself so you put your heart and soul to everything.

249
00:29:39,582 --> 00:29:42,824
One trick I do, I’ve realized this,

250
00:29:43,098 --> 00:29:46,938
when I have the feel that things are clouding up I try and clear them,

251
00:29:47,428 --> 00:29:48,983
I want like a fresh start.

252
00:29:49,224 --> 00:29:53,338
So in my mind every day I try polishing things

253
00:29:54,344 --> 00:29:58,948
so every little incident may be creeping in from the past

254
00:29:59,223 --> 00:30:03,578
or things aren’t quite right I try to look at them from a new perspective.

255
00:30:03,827 --> 00:30:15,863
It’s something to start a new morning. I feel like I carry unnecessary things with me.

256
00:30:17,384 --> 00:30:22,263
– Your father is still alive?
– Yes, he is.

257
00:30:22,504 --> 00:30:32,744
– He was fond of you especially?
– He was. Like salt of the earth.

258
00:30:33,018 --> 00:30:39,144
He is a proper, good, typical father figure but he never showed what he felt much.

259
00:30:39,908 --> 00:30:45,028
– But he was protecting you, pampering you?

260
00:30:47,588 --> 00:30:56,548
– I think he loves me very much but in fatherly way protective.

261
00:30:57,338 --> 00:31:01,943
We never really used to talk about things.

262
00:31:02,448 --> 00:31:08,907
He was very practical.  Never encouraged.

263
00:31:08,948 --> 00:31:14,338
I don’t mean it in a negative way, he’s genuinely wonderful man

264
00:31:14,584 --> 00:31:17,144
but he will look for the negative in some things.

265
00:31:17,391 --> 00:31:26,666
Whatever I do he wouldn’t say that’s good, he’d say that wasn’t right.

266
00:31:26,905 --> 00:31:29,740
So he would always look at the fault.

267
00:31:36,906 --> 00:31:43,736
– When you work, are you working continuously or in jerks,

268
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:47,307
that means you have some energy, you do things and then you are exhausted?

269
00:31:50,136 --> 00:32:00,625
– Jerks. My energy is in little packages. I need a break.

270
00:32:03,548 --> 00:32:10,212
– If you’re very angry how will you react now?

271
00:32:10,466 --> 00:32:17,792
Shout, throw things, throw a tantrum?
– There are 2 ways.

272
00:32:17,892 --> 00:32:23,625
– Do you have tantrums? If you want something and you cannot get it?

273
00:32:24,144 --> 00:32:27,214
– I have 2 reactions to things now.

274
00:32:27,465 --> 00:32:34,405
I try and I say ok I won’t let this bother me and deal with it.

275
00:32:34,505 --> 00:32:38,107
Sometimes can do that and then I am very pleased with myself.

276
00:32:38,371 --> 00:32:40,421
Other times I just can’t help it.

277
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:47,824
Before I can even control it I storm off and then 5 minutes after I finished.

278
00:32:48,101 --> 00:32:51,425
And then I can come back and talk about it.

279
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:56,545
I do have a habit taking things the wrong way.

280
00:32:58,587 --> 00:33:12,144
It’s when I react over the top, unfairly.

281
00:33:13,185 --> 00:33:16,771
I told about sabotaging things last time.

282
00:33:17,025 --> 00:33:21,891
I feel sometimes I test people unfairly, I don’t mean to,

283
00:33:23,171 --> 00:33:27,781
I torment them all, not every one I just mean people closer to me perhaps.

284
00:33:29,061 --> 00:33:36,464
I deliberately do things trying to get a reaction I am waiting for reaction that I can react.

285
00:33:40,827 --> 00:33:46,465
It’s like something so I can say “I’m bright.

286
00:33:46,704 --> 00:33:50,051
It’s not as good as I thought it was” and back out.

287
00:33:50,544 --> 00:33:57,731
I’m always looking for an escape. I always used to do that.

288
00:33:58,224 --> 00:34:03,344
An escape route. It’s there underneath, I think.

289
00:34:04,131 --> 00:34:08,741
If I am upset I won’t deal with something. I’m off.

290
00:34:09,251 --> 00:34:14,864
It’s very childish. But I’ll come back and talk about it.

291
00:34:18,704 --> 00:34:25,345
– Ok. Thank you.

292
00:34:26,384 --> 00:34:30,862
Here we have one of those cases which you don’t have a clear picture.

293
00:34:31,372 --> 00:34:37,262
You don’t get either because we don’t know enough about Homeopathy

294
00:34:37,505 --> 00:34:50,572
or we don’t know much about the patient or the patient cannot really express how is feeling

295
00:34:50,828 --> 00:34:58,252
and therefore there is a kind of confusion concerning this case.

296
00:34:59,532 --> 00:35:12,588
From what she says in words we cannot really get anything tangible.

297
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:21,666
You can hardly get any symptom. What you can get it by observation.

298
00:35:25,506 --> 00:35:36,264
We can use the observation of how she talks, how she feels without her saying that.

299
00:35:39,343 --> 00:35:53,148
She uses a kind of speech which is jerky, jumpy and there is an inner excitement.

300
00:35:57,506 --> 00:36:10,573
I feel this kind of behavior belongs to a person who has quite a lot of hysteria.

301
00:36:10,824 --> 00:36:18,748
It’s a hysterical person, she go off in a hysterical reaction

302
00:36:19,023 --> 00:36:25,666
in case she is pushed a little bit harder than usual.

303
00:36:25,933 --> 00:37:05,346
From that point of view there is a remedy that may fit this case and with great reservation.

304
00:37:07,706 --> 00:37:15,768
We could use this remedy to see if such a remedy could give what she wants.

305
00:37:15,868 --> 00:37:20,054
What she needs is more balance, more grounding.

306
00:37:20,308 --> 00:37:23,894
She feels that all these which are happening inside

307
00:37:24,148 --> 00:37:33,865
and bring to her this excitement is not really good though she says I am quite good.

308
00:37:34,604 --> 00:37:45,144
You feel something is lacking in order to be completely balanced.

309
00:37:45,385 --> 00:37:54,614
She is still battling to bring balance in herself.

310
00:37:54,868 --> 00:38:01,014
As you can see she tries to impose balance upon herself

311
00:38:01,509 --> 00:38:18,666
because the organism is excited and working too fast.

312
00:38:19,425 --> 00:38:27,385
So, we need a remedy that fits such a pathology.

313
00:38:27,467 --> 00:38:36,427
Where can you find it? It doesn’t exist!

314
00:38:37,456 --> 00:38:57,664
Has anybody an idea? You have an idea. I cannot treat my wife! He can!

315
00:38:57,936 --> 00:39:06,381
– Cof.
– That is the delusion of the husbands.

316
00:39:13,296 --> 00:39:29,421
Forget a husband can see his wife objectively. I have the best wife, always.

317
00:39:29,936 --> 00:39:36,336
Cof. is a good prescription but not for this case.

318
00:39:42,401 --> 00:39:50,206
Tarent.? Tarent. or Tarent-c.? Tarent.!

319
00:39:50,306 --> 00:40:05,412
Are you sure? Wrong! It’s not Tarent. Tarent. is totally different.

320
00:40:05,666 --> 00:40:21,114
Bell. Why? Desire to escape. She is too pale for Bell.

321
00:40:21,386 --> 00:40:28,025
Too hysterical.Bell. are much more down-to-earth.

322
00:40:29,795 --> 00:40:40,825
They know what they are talking about. There is a kind of awkward ness.

323
00:40:53,900 --> 00:41:11,306
I want to read from M.M. a few phrases to tell me if you hear this case is fitting?

324
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:17,706
“Fits to hysterical women with sensitive nature.

325
00:41:19,025 --> 00:41:46,024
Feeling of coldness. Shuddering, nervous laughter. Excitement. Suppression of menses”

326
00:41:46,298 --> 00:41:49,107
I did not investigate that.

327
00:41:52,398 --> 00:42:05,224
“Hurried tremolous and awkward. Best in activity, activity in jerks with weakness alternate.

328
00:42:06,263 --> 00:42:17,018
Violent anger. Talks excitedly. Scolds.

329
00:42:26,468 --> 00:42:51,578
Uncontrollable laughter. Desire for black coffee.

330
00:42:57,968 --> 00:43:07,944
Chest oppression, hysterical spasms of the chest, anxious palpitations, fear of death.”

331
00:43:09,988 --> 00:43:36,378
What is the remedy? Show them the repertorization. I did not get it myself.

332
00:43:36,627 --> 00:43:49,943
I got it from the computer and this is a remedy that fits mostly, not exactly.

333
00:43:57,938 --> 00:44:06,824
Mosch. has these frightful dreams, dreams of being drowned, nervous laughing,

334
00:44:07,098 --> 00:44:16,824
gestures, involuntary motion of hands and the speech is hesitating, abrupt, hasty, with jerks,

335
00:44:17,065 --> 00:44:24,504
all this makes one symptom and the malicious you just put it once, I am not sure.

336
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:39,589
Hyos. and Mosch. comes as a second prescription.

337
00:44:48,424 --> 00:44:58,689
So if she had admitted that she wants to kill we go to Hyos.

338
00:44:58,789 --> 00:45:09,445
If she does not admit that she wants to kill her husband then we go to Mosch.

339
00:45:09,545 --> 00:45:17,225
She has to decide and resolve for us the dilemma right here!

340
00:45:20,054 --> 00:45:29,268
The moment she will really change level, she has been affected by Stram. as we said,

341
00:45:31,574 --> 00:45:41,029
you will see changing her hairstyle. The hair will go back.

342
00:45:42,584 --> 00:45:53,065
She is hiding from herself, from others, she is too shy, too sensitive to be shown,

343
00:45:53,588 --> 00:46:02,548
allow others to see her, she is afraid others will not like her.

344
00:46:04,585 --> 00:46:12,548
She does this unconsciously. You don’t belong to this category.

345
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:25,100
She is much stronger. Mosch. or no Mosch.?

346
00:46:27,385 --> 00:46:33,546
– You’re the boss!
– I’m the boss...

347
00:46:33,585 --> 00:46:39,946
I feel there is quite a lot of hysteria and what impressed me is the laughter.

348
00:46:40,926 --> 00:46:47,626
If we put the case and replay you will see how many times the laughter comes,

349
00:46:47,865 --> 00:46:57,100
the tendency to come in a jerky way. Nervous laughing.

350
00:47:01,345 --> 00:47:11,485
I cannot replay but you can put back the case and I can show you again and again.

351
00:47:11,585 --> 00:47:27,184
Who remembers this? Who saw the nervous laughter?

352
00:47:34,625 --> 00:47:45,104
There is a kind of consensus that her laughter was a little bit out of context.

353
00:47:45,181 --> 00:47:52,291
This is the tendency of the person and this is what observation should do.

354
00:47:52,784 --> 00:48:02,021
Your observation is there to see the way she speaks because you cannot get really tangible symptoms.

355
00:48:04,304 --> 00:48:11,984
She is I am better in everything except of one thing.

356
00:48:20,451 --> 00:48:25,293
– George, what about the destructiveness?

357
00:48:25,344 --> 00:48:47,508
– Mosch. has that. My problem with Hyos. as completing the action of Stram.

358
00:48:47,826 --> 00:48:56,740
was that in Hyos. first of all you need the real desire to kill.

359
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:02,740
They are not killing but the desire is there.

360
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:06,063
The desire to kill this, this and that person.

361
00:49:06,824 --> 00:49:21,423
Also the impulse to kill comes with Merc. as well. Merc. most probably

362
00:49:21,666 --> 00:49:30,108
was indicate in a stage 2 years ago with the excessive salivation

363
00:49:30,383 --> 00:49:45,468
and most probably Merc. having different impulses she may been benefited by it.

364
00:49:45,743 --> 00:49:48,303
Now, it’s not yet the time for Merc.

365
00:49:48,546 --> 00:49:55,708
So if you we give Mosch. and after it we see that the salivation starts coming back,

366
00:49:55,983 --> 00:50:02,893
most probably her organism is preparing for a Merc. state.

367
00:50:08,013 --> 00:50:28,257
Hurried. Tremolous. Excitement. Talks excitedly is exactly what she does.

368
00:50:37,786 --> 00:50:39,137
She is trembling all over.

369
00:50:39,652 --> 00:50:45,788
Do you realize you tremble all over? No, you don’t.

370
00:50:46,052 --> 00:50:57,826
You think you are calm now? You are not that excited.

371
00:50:58,065 --> 00:51:01,412
What do you say Mr. husband?

372
00:51:01,505 --> 00:51:06,786
– It’s impossible to treat your wife!

373
00:51:07,025 --> 00:51:12,058
– But usually you can give some information.

374
00:51:12,823 --> 00:51:17,427
You think it is a good remedy, you agree with that?

375
00:51:17,668 --> 00:51:21,783
What do you think? She is calm now? Do you call it ‘calm’?

376
00:51:23,063 --> 00:51:49,304
– Yes, before the storm! What shall we do?
– 30C.

377
00:51:50,325 --> 00:52:04,664
– So high? You are so courageous. Ok. She doesn’t like this remedy, it is obvious.

378
00:52:07,224 --> 00:52:14,425
I have something very important to say here.

379
00:52:16,985 --> 00:52:23,638
She was here and she said she had an aggravation after we made an analysis,

380
00:52:23,738 --> 00:52:29,348
no remedy, in the night she goes in tantrum.

381
00:52:29,623 --> 00:52:33,463
She calls is ‘an aggravation’ and then an amelioration.

382
00:52:33,704 --> 00:52:38,824
This is how things are misunderstood and misinterpreted.

383
00:52:39,347 --> 00:52:47,784
When you expect a remedy and you don’t get a remedy you get angry and you have to get out of your anger.

384
00:52:48,058 --> 00:52:51,383
Your anger finally comes out, it’s expressed,

385
00:52:51,624 --> 00:52:54,184
she said by that time she could not control myself,

386
00:52:54,458 --> 00:52:57,783
I did not know what I was thinking and doing all these kinds of things

387
00:52:58,024 --> 00:53:02,628
and reactions and next day she was better.

388
00:53:03,418 --> 00:53:05,463
This is NOT an aggravation.

389
00:53:07,748 --> 00:53:17,747
Let’s say we had given a remedy and this reaction took place.

390
00:53:18,504 --> 00:53:19,428
How would you explain it?

391
00:53:19,695 --> 00:53:23,535
You would think that the remedy had acted, there was an aggravation and then an amelioration.

392
00:53:23,786 --> 00:53:25,728
That’s one misunderstanding.

393
00:53:25,828 --> 00:53:33,861
Second misunderstanding is that she says I saw 4 dreams with a pattern.

394
00:53:34,107 --> 00:53:44,347
If we were doing a proving especially a dream proving

395
00:53:44,611 --> 00:53:50,224
who would not believe that these dreams were because of the remedy?

396
00:53:51,265 --> 00:53:54,341
This is how the misunderstanding comes

397
00:53:54,587 --> 00:54:02,267
and how all these super nonsense are coming on the Repertory and the M.M.

398
00:54:05,091 --> 00:54:13,441
You give one remedy to the whole class and you say tell me tomorrow all your dreams.

399
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:22,224
And one says he had a dream riding his bicycle and the other one had a dream with a goat

400
00:54:23,504 --> 00:54:30,945
and someone had a dream with a tree with two branches.

401
00:54:32,225 --> 00:54:45,541
Everyone is belonging to the same remedy because the dream means he is pursued by the devil

402
00:54:45,787 --> 00:54:53,985
because devil has two and the motorbike has these 2 and the goat also has these 2.

403
00:54:54,747 --> 00:55:01,665
Therefore the general theme is pursued by the devil.

404
00:55:01,909 --> 00:55:08,581
That is what is going on now in proving of remedies.

405
00:55:09,461 --> 00:55:18,821
Not only that but this section all has placebo and all this section has the real

406
00:55:19,067 --> 00:55:24,944
and they see some dreams which fit with the dreams of this group

407
00:55:25,467 --> 00:55:31,792
and they say that’s even better this group confirms

408
00:55:32,068 --> 00:55:38,979
that this pursuing of the devil is really correct and belongs to the remedy.

409
00:55:39,225 --> 00:55:45,872
Instead of saying if these people have the same dream with this group

410
00:55:46,148 --> 00:55:51,779
that means this symptom must not be taken into account.

411
00:55:52,025 --> 00:55:57,392
It belongs to placebo. It is accidental.

412
00:55:57,668 --> 00:56:03,005
You cannot say it belongs to the remedy once it also appears in the placebo group.

413
00:56:03,105 --> 00:56:08,741
But you cannot make a proving in one night and you don’t have to take the remedy, the powder,

414
00:56:08,987 --> 00:56:12,304
you put it over the head or under your pillow,

415
00:56:12,581 --> 00:56:17,424
you sleep on the pillow and if you see a dream that dream belongs to the remedy.

416
00:56:18,211 --> 00:56:24,101
You have to be aware of this kind of proving and not take it seriously.

417
00:56:24,347 --> 00:56:31,781
I criticize provings which are done in such a superficial way as to give a remedy

418
00:56:32,027 --> 00:56:35,785
and sleep over and tell me tomorrow night what is your dream

419
00:56:36,024 --> 00:56:39,864
and then they believe that the dreams you saw are because of the remedy.

420
00:56:40,144 --> 00:56:44,494
It’s not because of the remedy. It’s because of a thousand of conditions.

421
00:56:50,894 --> 00:56:58,207
I will talk a little bit about the provings and I will tell you what is my ideas

422
00:56:58,307 --> 00:57:02,546
but Paul Herscu one of the good American homeopaths is writing a book

423
00:57:02,818 --> 00:57:08,946
 on proving on which I gave my views.

424
00:57:09,218 --> 00:57:14,338
So, if you really want to see my views on proving this book will come out

425
00:57:14,584 --> 00:57:17,906
and you can read but I will tell you a few things

426
00:57:18,424 --> 00:57:24,067
because it is a very important issue that is confusing us for the moment

427
00:57:24,578 --> 00:57:29,698
because a lot of people say let’s do a proving. It’s not so simple.
