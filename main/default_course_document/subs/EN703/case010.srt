1
00:00:18,067 --> 00:00:28,307
You were in a panic state this morning only or this happens regularly in your life?

2
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:33,508
– It doesn’t happen regularly. But it has happened before.

3
00:00:33,747 --> 00:00:37,348
– How many times? 
 -Twice.

4
00:00:38,352 --> 00:00:44,259
– For a reason? 
-That I don’t know.

5
00:00:44,505 --> 00:00:58,850
I’ll tell you the first time; when I was around the 15 there was a stress for the exams.

6
00:01:13,946 --> 00:01:24,704
I feel like I’m close to losing my mind. That’s what’s been going on.

7
00:01:24,948 --> 00:01:41,588
And I’ve lost myself. I am analyzing myself all the time.

8
00:01:42,175 --> 00:01:49,025
I have to bring it down at the moment to really simple things.

9
00:01:49,305 --> 00:01:52,106
I feel like I am making a fool of myself.

10
00:01:59,545 --> 00:02:04,906
Deep down there’s something that’s really ugly.

11
00:02:05,175 --> 00:02:07,984
Still I’m confused about that.

12
00:02:12,345 --> 00:02:28,505
There is always people around me, I met some lovely people here and people that I know a little bit

13
00:02:28,785 --> 00:02:31,107
and maybe I’ve just revealed too much for myself

14
00:02:31,374 --> 00:02:36,227
and I am confusing my boundaries with my friends and Homeopathy.

15
00:02:36,494 --> 00:02:40,585
I’m scarred of losing everything.

16
00:02:40,824 --> 00:02:52,524
If I go down any further and I lose my identity then what do I have?

17
00:02:53,624 --> 00:03:01,304
It all comes to surface when I’m here and I expect to come here and enjoy the week

18
00:03:05,934 --> 00:03:15,145
because I love Homeopathy but I think I haven’t realized the power of it until now.

19
00:03:16,025 --> 00:03:18,467
– This is the first time you come?

20
00:03:20,265 --> 00:03:35,638
– Yes and I felt before I came here I felt together and I can be a good homeopath...

21
00:03:43,826 --> 00:03:49,392
I want to heal people but I have to heal myself first

22
00:03:49,668 --> 00:03:53,747
before I can go any further now that all this stuff has come up.

23
00:03:54,265 --> 00:04:11,574
When I bury it then things keep surfacing.

24
00:04:11,828 --> 00:04:16,425
And it’s got to come out. I’ve been telling everybody.

25
00:04:16,694 --> 00:04:20,265
I know I am making a lot of people very irritated with me.

26
00:04:20,788 --> 00:04:28,214
– Irritated or very anxious about you?

27
00:04:34,614 --> 00:04:41,459
– Both. Some people that don’t know me feel irritated...

28
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:53,026
- Was there any event that happened here with colleagues?

29
00:04:53,206 --> 00:05:02,507
You had some kind of very close contact and after that you felt hurt,

30
00:05:02,776 --> 00:05:08,667
you opened up yourself too much.

31
00:05:09,185 --> 00:05:31,896
– I’ve opened up myself too much to people that didn’t need it at the time.

32
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:43,652
– Didn’t need to hear what you say. 
-Yes.

33
00:05:44,145 --> 00:05:50,817
– Did you feel immediately hurt after that or you went back home,

34
00:05:51,068 --> 00:05:57,732
you thought about it and then the panic and the anxiety started?

35
00:05:57,886 --> 00:06:09,463
– The anxiety has been worse at night, definitely. Because it’s inward.

36
00:06:11,258 --> 00:06:17,807
And I feel that I have to deal with what’s inside and bring it out

37
00:06:17,907 --> 00:06:21,988
and I haven’t been doing that properly.

38
00:06:21,988 --> 00:06:23,544
– Are you married? 
-Yes.

39
00:06:24,308 --> 00:06:29,669
– Do you have children? 
- Yes, 2 children.

40
00:06:55,269 --> 00:07:09,104
– Do you worry about them or at the moment you are concentrated

41
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,905
on what is happening inside of you?

42
00:07:12,185 --> 00:07:18,544
– Honest answer is I’m not really worried about them. Ι’m totally self-absorbed.

43
00:07:19,067 --> 00:07:29,307
Except last night when I felt I was going through a lot of different states.

44
00:07:30,064 --> 00:07:37,977
The worst point; last night I felt I couldn’t work with how reality was for a while.

45
00:07:38,226 --> 00:07:41,027
I heard dogs barking.

46
00:07:43,562 --> 00:07:51,542
I couldn’t work whether there was a delusion of dogs barking or if there really was barking.

47
00:07:51,788 --> 00:08:04,067
I was very scarred. When I was at my lowest point then that was

48
00:08:04,342 --> 00:08:16,867
when I prayed and tried to make a connection with my husband and the children.

49
00:08:18,668 --> 00:08:26,102
The more connections I am trying to make the more I feel I will push people away.

50
00:08:29,177 --> 00:08:34,787
Ask me some questions because I’m confused.

51
00:08:35,062 --> 00:08:46,828
– Did ever have this kind of experience, maybe not so intense but less,

52
00:08:47,346 --> 00:08:58,743
frequently or there are periods where you have no problem at all and suddenly it comes?

53
00:08:58,843 --> 00:09:04,868
– There are periods where I have no problems.

54
00:09:05,043 --> 00:09:10,778
– And suddenly this states comes out of always

55
00:09:11,027 --> 00:09:17,178
more or less the same reason or for different reasons?

56
00:09:17,427 --> 00:09:27,808
– It’s the same reason; lack of connection to other people. That’s how I conceive it.

57
00:09:27,908 --> 00:09:34,308
– Do you consider yourself an open person that can easily open up to others?

58
00:09:34,483 --> 00:09:46,867
– Yes, I can do but I am not really showing my real self.

59
00:09:47,524 --> 00:09:52,503
So I’m not really opening up myself.

60
00:09:58,703 --> 00:10:04,264
The duality between having done Homeopathy course...

61
00:10:08,378 --> 00:10:28,344
perhaps it made me even more self-absorbed 
because I’m analyzing myself all the time.

62
00:10:28,624 --> 00:10:33,464
– You can forget about homeopathic rubrics and symptoms

63
00:10:33,744 --> 00:10:38,826
and you try to describe exactly how you feel in your own words,

64
00:10:39,095 --> 00:10:42,666
as if you don’t know anything about Homeopathy.

65
00:10:47,024 --> 00:11:03,664
When you talk now to me are you certain you are present or... do you understand?

66
00:11:03,905 --> 00:11:07,255
– I understand.

67
00:11:07,745 --> 00:11:12,624
– But it’s difficult to answer
 – Yes.

68
00:11:12,765 --> 00:11:15,586
– Does it happen during this time?

69
00:11:15,853 --> 00:11:24,813
I can make it more clear you may be talking and you think somebody else is talking, not you.

70
00:11:25,064 --> 00:11:26,588
That you are observing.

71
00:11:26,863 --> 00:11:30,703
– I felt last night that people were talking about me.

72
00:11:30,946 --> 00:11:35,966
I’ve been feeling that a lot and that’s part of the picture that comes from time to time.

73
00:11:36,066 --> 00:11:51,426
I get a bit paranoid. It’s obvious that I’m in a state because I’ve been so confused,

74
00:11:57,537 --> 00:12:03,937
I can only deal with really simple things and I feel completely lost.

75
00:12:04,188 --> 00:12:18,786
– What is your desire at this state?
– Just to find myself.

76
00:12:19,025 --> 00:12:24,668
– Except of that, you cannot find yourself but your desire is to be with people,

77
00:12:24,932 --> 00:12:37,986
people to whom to feel close, be with your children, husband, friend who you trust, be protected...?

78
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:51,025
– Any of these things. Do you mean right now? I want to be healed.

79
00:12:57,788 --> 00:13:04,188
– Do you like people being around seeing you or you like to stay by yourself?

80
00:13:07,528 --> 00:13:13,666
You like that some people will come and console you?

81
00:13:16,744 --> 00:13:23,388
I don’t mean really only console you,

82
00:13:23,663 --> 00:13:32,104
I mean maybe you need some protection, some people may protect you.

83
00:13:32,348 --> 00:13:36,363
You feel unprotected?
– Yes.

84
00:13:36,463 --> 00:13:46,184
– I cannot imagine so I would like you to describe for me. The real thing.

85
00:13:47,464 --> 00:13:51,723
It may be difficult but you have to describe.

86
00:13:51,823 --> 00:14:00,508
– It’s difficult for me to describe.
– Why is it difficult?

87
00:14:03,186 --> 00:14:11,533
Do you know why or not?
– I don’t know why.

88
00:14:22,024 --> 00:14:30,223
- For example if someone I feel is warm and I feel safe with comes over

89
00:14:30,466 --> 00:14:34,306
then it’s ok for a while and I feel the connection.

90
00:14:34,512 --> 00:14:40,665
This happened with some of the other people I’ve met here.

91
00:14:40,912 --> 00:14:49,007
I opened up myself so much and they put their arms around me and that’s wonderful time,

92
00:14:49,107 --> 00:14:56,272
when they’re gone then I slip back again

93
00:14:56,548 --> 00:15:05,508
and I can’t keep on doing that to people because it is selfish.

94
00:15:05,747 --> 00:15:10,867
That’s what is.

95
00:15:12,147 --> 00:15:19,827
 – Do you feel you are critical to yourself?
– Yes.

96
00:15:24,947 --> 00:15:32,627
– In the night do you have any salivation when you sleep?

97
00:15:33,145 --> 00:15:43,842
– Usually there is. But now my mouth is very dry.

98
00:15:43,942 --> 00:15:47,188
– At this moment. And you would like to drink something?

99
00:15:47,429 --> 00:15:56,148
– Actually I would now.
– Bring some water.

100
00:15:57,505 --> 00:16:06,388
Can you swallow or you have difficulty if you try to eat?

101
00:16:14,584 --> 00:16:21,125
– No, there is no physical difficulties swallowing.

102
00:16:21,225 --> 00:16:29,428
But I have not really been hungry. And I think that’s part of it as well.

103
00:16:29,944 --> 00:16:41,705
– Would you say that you are a person who feels more the cold or the heat?

104
00:16:49,144 --> 00:16:59,109
– I don’t think I’m strongly either way, actually.

105
00:16:59,384 --> 00:17:10,384
I don’t strongly feel the heat or cold but I can feel both at times.

106
00:17:19,095 --> 00:17:26,775
Last night, for example, when I was in this restaurant there were times

107
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:38,544
when I didn’t feel the cold at all and people were saying oh you don’t feel the cold?

108
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:50,416
And then I would go the other way shivering and someone gave me her own jacket

109
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:54,746
because I’ve forgotten mine.

110
00:17:55,021 --> 00:18:01,664
– You felt cold?
– Yes, shivering.

111
00:18:02,944 --> 00:18:09,867
– Do you have any taste in your mouth?
– No taste.

112
00:18:10,106 --> 00:18:16,781
– Do you have any bleeding of gums when you brush your teeth?

113
00:18:17,024 --> 00:18:20,107
– Sometimes but not frequently.

114
00:18:20,246 --> 00:18:24,876
– Do you have a lot of problems with your teeth?
– No.

115
00:18:24,976 --> 00:18:33,836
– As a child you had problems with ears? Frequent otitis?
– No, I don’t think so.

116
00:18:33,936 --> 00:18:36,496
– Do you perspire easily?

117
00:18:36,747 --> 00:18:42,938
– Yes, usually when I’m nervous, I had a problem with that particularly in armpits.

118
00:18:43,187 --> 00:18:47,543
– Why do you say it is a problem? Because you don’t like it?

119
00:18:47,784 --> 00:19:01,025
– Yes, because it has a bad smell.
– So if you perspire you feel uncomfortable?

120
00:19:01,305 --> 00:19:06,666
– Only if it’s something...

121
00:19:17,684 --> 00:19:24,130
- You are trying to say something and you lose the thread of...
-Yes.

122
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:36,930
– Forget it. Do you a have a fear that others may see how you feel?

123
00:19:37,428 --> 00:19:42,548
Even by looking at you?

124
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:50,048
Even if a stranger looks at you I think that he may know why I feel so bad?

125
00:19:57,665 --> 00:20:05,245
– I’m confused whether you mean right this minute or generally?

126
00:20:05,345 --> 00:20:12,025
– When you are in that state.
– Yes. I can have both.

127
00:20:12,266 --> 00:20:18,425
I tried to go away and deal it by myself this morning

128
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:26,615
and left in order others no to worry and I met them up here.

129
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:36,065
When I went down into the town for start I got lost which is stupid

130
00:20:36,345 --> 00:20:53,744
and I just wandered around and tried to do these simple things that would help ground me and...

131
00:20:53,985 --> 00:20:56,055
I forgot the question.

132
00:20:58,864 --> 00:21:02,704
– Another question;

133
00:21:02,945 --> 00:21:10,625
do you have regular bowel motion or are you constipated or have you diarrhea?

134
00:21:11,146 --> 00:21:18,585
– At the moment I’ve been going less frequently since I got here.

135
00:21:19,095 --> 00:21:27,024
Normally I go regularly every day. Sometimes more than once a day actually.

136
00:21:27,265 --> 00:21:32,385
– And here you don’t go once a day? You go once every second day?

137
00:21:32,665 --> 00:21:42,284
– No, I haven’t been going so often. I don’t know exactly.

138
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:48,025
I don’t pay much attention to that.

139
00:21:48,025 --> 00:21:53,664
But definitely there have been changes in my bowel movement.

140
00:21:53,936 --> 00:22:00,336
It’s less often.
- You noticed that.

141
00:22:05,707 --> 00:22:16,067
– You don’t drink much water.
– I think I am waiting for you to press the button!

142
00:22:25,304 --> 00:22:34,787
I think probably need a good slap around my face...

143
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:58,238
- Do you have craving for ice cream, sweet, anything?

144
00:22:58,338 --> 00:23:02,627
– Not now. I don’t have craving for anything really.

145
00:23:02,802 --> 00:23:06,742
– Usually do you take sweets?
– Yes.

146
00:23:06,988 --> 00:23:12,767
– A lot?
– I like something sweet every day.

147
00:23:12,867 --> 00:23:19,442
– What about salt?
– Not so much.

148
00:23:19,542 --> 00:23:25,942
– In spite of eating sweets you still are quite thin. You don’t put on weight.

149
00:23:26,188 --> 00:23:30,962
Or are you careful and you don’t put on weight?

150
00:23:31,062 --> 00:23:34,145
If you are not eating carefully you put on weight?

151
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:39,184
– No. It hasn’t been so. I don’t know now.

152
00:23:39,425 --> 00:23:49,424
Probably I would put on a little bit weight if I overindulge now but I go to the gym.

153
00:23:58,384 --> 00:24:10,145
I’m lucky in that way.

154
00:24:12,215 --> 00:24:18,346
– Do you like rice?
– It’s ok.

155
00:24:18,515 --> 00:24:25,015
– Milk?
– I wouldn’t drink a glass of milk.

156
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:30,044
– Fish? Not so much.

157
00:24:30,144 --> 00:24:43,526
– You had any fears not only now but fear of dark, of animals, thunderstorms, death...

158
00:24:43,626 --> 00:24:53,104
- Fear of losing things.
– That is the main fear.

159
00:24:56,426 --> 00:25:03,865
– Fear of madness has come up.

160
00:25:04,106 --> 00:25:09,226
Fear that I will go insane has come up for me these last few days.

161
00:25:09,495 --> 00:25:17,665
Fear that people will not like me, that’s strong.

162
00:25:18,455 --> 00:25:26,905
– The special people who you like or in general?

163
00:25:35,095 --> 00:25:44,055
– I want to be loved by everyone actually and that’s not possible. I want the impossible.

164
00:25:44,304 --> 00:25:47,526
– Can you describe a little bit your character?

165
00:25:47,626 --> 00:25:56,755
Are you very irritable or calm, you are easily offended or very easily hurt?

166
00:25:56,855 --> 00:26:06,347
– I’m very easily hurt actually. I’m sensitive to criticism.

167
00:26:06,586 --> 00:26:14,027
– You express anger?
– Not easily.

168
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:33,227
– Can you give me an idea, if you are angry how will you feel inside?
– Not this moment.

169
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:40,656
– If you are angry have you ever wanted to throw something,

170
00:26:40,907 --> 00:26:48,011
do you have the impulse to hit or do some violence?
– No, never.

171
00:26:48,188 --> 00:26:56,768
– You never had this impulse? Not that you do it but is there the impulse?

172
00:26:56,868 --> 00:27:08,904
– No, only to myself.
– Do what to yourself? Hit?

173
00:27:09,178 --> 00:27:16,858
– I’ve already told. Kill myself.

174
00:27:17,007 --> 00:27:33,944
And that’s why I’m scared going back to my black state I was in before

175
00:27:34,847 --> 00:27:43,239
where I did try and kill myself.

176
00:27:43,506 --> 00:27:50,424
– How?
– I cut my wrists.

177
00:27:57,604 --> 00:28:05,266
– Because of that state you did not like yourself.

178
00:28:05,438 --> 00:28:11,938
– That was after I had Adam, my son, in America.

179
00:28:12,184 --> 00:28:18,066
I went through a very bad postnatal depression.

180
00:28:18,338 --> 00:28:22,424
That’s the worst state I’ve ever been in.

181
00:28:22,671 --> 00:28:33,598
I was totally out... rejecting love actually.

182
00:28:33,698 --> 00:28:42,086
– You rejecting or others rejecting your love?
– Both.

183
00:28:42,186 --> 00:28:56,466
– I couldn’t sort this one out. It’s a desperate need for love this inside.

184
00:28:56,738 --> 00:29:02,104
When it is given to me I keep on pushing it away.

185
00:29:02,204 --> 00:29:09,027
– What remedies have you been given so far?

186
00:29:09,266 --> 00:29:16,946
– I took a remedy myself which was a big mistake. Phos.

187
00:29:17,218 --> 00:29:23,107
– When did you take it?
– Yesterday, here.

188
00:29:23,346 --> 00:29:26,424
– Did you take another remedy before?

189
00:29:26,671 --> 00:29:39,986
– I’ve had Ph-ac. which I didn’t feel it was me but maybe it is at the moment.

190
00:29:45,378 --> 00:29:52,271
I’ve had Phos. from my friend.

191
00:29:53,828 --> 00:29:58,949
If sometimes I phoned her she said go away and take some Phos.

192
00:29:59,224 --> 00:30:04,585
It was not often, maybe twice.

193
00:30:05,108 --> 00:30:08,325
– Calc.?
– No.

194
00:30:08,425 --> 00:30:17,554
– Merc.?
– No. I’ve been scared to take remedies

195
00:30:17,654 --> 00:30:21,669
 because maybe that’s the thing I’ve really opened up.

196
00:30:22,185 --> 00:30:33,705
What needs to come out.
– Your nails are strong?

197
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:42,665
– Yes, they’re ok.
– Ok.

198
00:30:44,984 --> 00:30:49,429
– Finished?
– Yes.

199
00:30:52,064 --> 00:30:53,578
Do you want to ask any question?

200
00:30:54,424 --> 00:30:58,264
She will be prepared to answer, she said.

201
00:31:15,884 --> 00:31:22,547
America! Always forward!

202
00:31:23,063 --> 00:31:28,183
– What is making you feel better?

203
00:31:35,588 --> 00:31:48,804
– Attention. That’s what I want. That’s the uppermost thing. Thank you.

204
00:31:48,904 --> 00:32:09,426
– You are friends?
– Do you have a time where you feel better?

205
00:32:09,698 --> 00:32:17,871
In the night you said you feel worse definitely.

206
00:32:18,147 --> 00:32:22,744
Is there another time when you feel better?

207
00:32:22,991 --> 00:32:47,587
– Yes. Now. When I am getting the attention which is a horrible thing because that’s it.

208
00:32:47,826 --> 00:32:53,711
I’m sure now you’ve pushed the button that’s it.

209
00:32:53,887 --> 00:32:59,107
I am ready to reveal it now.
– You need attention.

210
00:32:59,346 --> 00:33:15,748
– That’s the core of the problem.
– So if you have consolation you feel good.

211
00:33:16,023 --> 00:33:29,064
– Yes. I like consolation but I do reject it sometimes.

212
00:33:29,287 --> 00:33:33,814
– Can you feel worse when somebody tries to console you?

213
00:33:34,309 --> 00:33:50,185
– Yes, I can when I’m depressed certainly because everyone keeps on trying to help me.

214
00:33:54,789 --> 00:34:18,186
Now I’m sick of myself. 
– Anybody else who wants to ask? Any psychiatrist?

215
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:25,515
Would like to ask some question?

216
00:34:25,615 --> 00:34:31,748
– What do you mean when you say I’ve lost myself?

217
00:34:34,826 --> 00:34:45,580
– I am afraid I am afraid to lose my identity, she says.

218
00:34:46,346 --> 00:34:51,115
– Do you feel better when you feel accepted by a group?

219
00:34:51,215 --> 00:34:54,465
Is it difficult coming into a new group at first?

220
00:34:54,732 --> 00:34:58,920
Especially like this, a big one, for the first time.
– Yes.

221
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:13,615
– You feel better being accepted in a group.
– Ehm... I feel...

222
00:35:37,668 --> 00:36:04,544
- Two little questions. Do you have suicide intention?
– No.

223
00:36:06,096 --> 00:36:12,224
– She is afraid she may come to that state.

224
00:36:12,496 --> 00:36:19,804
– Yes, I am afraid of coming to that state.

225
00:36:19,904 --> 00:36:23,542
– What’s your relation to music? Can it help you?

226
00:36:23,788 --> 00:36:43,747
– Yes. Dancing. I love to dance and I like singing.
– So the cure is disco!

227
00:36:52,466 --> 00:36:57,586
– Let me ask a question myself.

228
00:36:57,846 --> 00:37:18,697
Did you feel comfortable in the consultation room or uncomfortable?

229
00:37:18,797 --> 00:37:24,546
– I felt confused. I didn’t want to speak.

230
00:37:25,064 --> 00:37:27,768
I want someone who can really understand.

231
00:37:27,868 --> 00:37:34,686
That’s what I feel; I’m talking but none really understands me and I am not making sense.

232
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:42,733
You feel nobody understands you. Are you sure?

233
00:37:49,328 --> 00:38:01,884
Merc., Alum., Phos., Calc., Stram. Alum. and Merc.

234
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:11,172
are the 2 remedies you should have been thinking in this case.

235
00:38:17,572 --> 00:38:29,857
She says the worst period is in the night where she feels she will lose her mind.

236
00:38:29,957 --> 00:38:43,665
Show me fear of insanity during night. Calc., Merc. and Phys.

237
00:38:43,837 --> 00:38:51,868
You see Merc. is practically one of the very few remedies that especially in the night,

238
00:38:52,132 --> 00:38:58,017
they become fearful of losing their minds.

239
00:39:00,305 --> 00:39:10,545
Alum. the way she talks, the difficulty in expressing...

240
00:39:11,068 --> 00:39:26,328
Show me the remedies for fear of insanity in general. You don’t have it.

241
00:39:26,428 --> 00:39:43,725
We see Calc., Manc., Puls. and Cann-i. Merc. is in italics and Alum. too.

242
00:39:43,825 --> 00:40:09,948
Suicidal disposition; Merc. and Alum. again are on the second degree.

243
00:40:10,212 --> 00:40:18,557
Here we have a problem. We have to choose a remedy between Alum. and Merc.

244
00:40:18,657 --> 00:40:23,785
Which of the 2 is the strongest?

245
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:38,388
If you have heard the M.M. of these 2 remedies maybe you would be able to differentiate.

246
00:40:40,184 --> 00:40:52,214
If you see the way she speaks, taking so long to say something...

247
00:40:52,984 --> 00:41:04,229
that means the mind is not clear and it looks like an Alum. mind.

248
00:41:04,329 --> 00:41:11,428
This kind of difficulty.

249
00:41:12,708 --> 00:41:23,705
– Looking specifically on Merc. and Alum. and she says very pronounced she tries to find herself;

250
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:30,105
that’s more Alum. Merc. is more in great danger from the environment.

251
00:41:30,385 --> 00:41:39,340
That’s not her problem. There is no danger from the environment but to find her own self.

252
00:41:44,526 --> 00:41:55,015
– The saliva has become less but the constipation has become more.

253
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:57,067
– No, she didn’t say saliva has become less,

254
00:41:57,306 --> 00:42:02,087
I asked every night and she said not every night.

255
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:09,516
– Oh, I thought she said it.
– It’s reduced now.

256
00:42:09,616 --> 00:42:19,066
– Now she is more constipated.
– I want to ask if Hell. is to be considered.

257
00:42:19,341 --> 00:42:29,067
– No. Hell. is much more dramatic.
– I do often lose my way in known places.

258
00:42:31,104 --> 00:42:37,950
– Merc. wants to do things quickly and Alum. wants to do things slowly,

259
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:41,145
so you can ask her about it.

260
00:42:41,386 --> 00:42:46,506
– Can you answer; you do things quickly or slowly?

261
00:42:47,024 --> 00:42:58,835
– At the moment I’ve slowed down but I am often agitated and quick.

262
00:42:58,935 --> 00:43:05,066
But right now, since I’ve been here, as I have been feeling worse,

263
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:08,827
I’ve lost this sort of hurriedness.

264
00:43:09,096 --> 00:43:14,466
I am usually hurried in the things I do and I’ve got too much to do.

265
00:43:17,692 --> 00:43:25,505
But I feel I am shut down at the moment and slowed.

266
00:43:25,605 --> 00:43:31,148
– Could you tell us about the menstruation?

267
00:43:31,387 --> 00:43:35,745
– I don’t have problems with menstruation.

268
00:43:35,845 --> 00:43:41,032
– Do you have any changes in your body before the time of bleeding?

269
00:43:41,132 --> 00:43:58,785
– Like PMS? Not much. I don’t have swollen breasts or pain with my periods, they are fairly regular.

270
00:43:59,308 --> 00:44:06,988
– Did you have any operations on your female system?
– No.

271
00:44:07,502 --> 00:44:16,705
– Can you give us some information if you like about your...

272
00:44:16,972 --> 00:44:23,867
What was I going to ask you?
– To give some more information about myself.

273
00:44:24,142 --> 00:44:37,947
– No. About your sexual drive. Can you say anything about it?

274
00:44:38,222 --> 00:44:46,045
– My sexual desire is suppressed I think.

275
00:44:46,145 --> 00:44:55,628
– Less than normal. Appears to be less than normal but actually is more than normal.

276
00:44:55,867 --> 00:45:10,465
– It’s absent except when there is a situation. Then everything is fine. Spontaneously.

277
00:45:13,061 --> 00:45:18,691
– Is there any change in your coordination?

278
00:45:18,945 --> 00:45:26,107
Are you clumsy or everything is normal?

279
00:45:26,371 --> 00:45:36,247
– No change in coordination.
– Ok, I think it’s enough. I want to continue what I said.

280
00:45:36,347 --> 00:45:50,427
The way she spoke is characteristic of Alum. if this way comes because of a mental confusion.

281
00:45:50,527 --> 00:46:03,144
Alum. does not know the answer and cannot make clear in her mind what she wants to say.

282
00:46:03,388 --> 00:46:06,366
Here, it’s a very interesting observation

283
00:46:06,466 --> 00:46:14,343
because we may have this kind of reaction as somebody said in Merc.,

284
00:46:14,443 --> 00:46:26,063
where Merc. need others to be attentive otherwise they don’t speak.

285
00:46:26,306 --> 00:46:31,693
You remember I told about the case of a singer who came to see me

286
00:46:31,944 --> 00:46:41,423
and I asked her what is the problem with you and she stayed like that.

287
00:46:41,666 --> 00:46:49,613
I waited for about a minute. I said what is the problem...

288
00:46:49,864 --> 00:46:57,293
Minutes is a long time waiting to get a response!

289
00:47:08,303 --> 00:47:14,946
I asked her 3-4 times, no response.

290
00:47:15,213 --> 00:47:25,704
She has come to consult me and a psychiatrist was sitting next to me and it was one of my first cases.

291
00:47:25,948 --> 00:47:33,903
I did not know at that time how Merc. could behave like this.

292
00:47:36,188 --> 00:47:43,624
Suddenly it comes to my mind that in order to make her speak I have to ask her about India.

293
00:47:43,868 --> 00:47:50,268
I told her have you been to India? She said yes.

294
00:47:50,543 --> 00:48:01,293
3 minutes without any communication and suddenly I asked about India etc. and she started talking.

295
00:48:01,544 --> 00:48:13,826
But in the beginning I never want to give the impression to the patient

296
00:48:14,093 --> 00:48:17,833
that I am sympathetic, that I am listening very much...

297
00:48:17,933 --> 00:48:24,097
I am very cool, I am just an observer. I put the question and then I observe.

298
00:48:24,348 --> 00:48:32,028
She felt that there is no connection. She could not talk.

299
00:48:32,292 --> 00:48:37,905
The moment I asked a familiar thing to her,

300
00:48:38,177 --> 00:48:43,025
she thought this man must have been in India...

301
00:48:43,297 --> 00:48:51,228
she felt the connection and she started talking.

302
00:48:51,492 --> 00:49:00,945
And then I realized why Merc. has this type of stammering.

303
00:49:01,217 --> 00:49:11,972
They stammer in this way, very sympathetic way.

304
00:49:12,126 --> 00:49:17,857
They need sympathy, they need attention. And that’s why they cannot express.

305
00:49:18,108 --> 00:49:24,257
Unless they have this connection and the sympathy they cannot communicate.

306
00:49:24,508 --> 00:49:30,908
So she was in between, she was acting like Alum.

307
00:49:31,172 --> 00:49:34,497
but I could not realize whether it was because of total confusion,

308
00:49:34,748 --> 00:49:44,226
losing identity, somebody else is talking because in Alum. the confusion is such

309
00:49:44,465 --> 00:49:49,857
that sometimes they talk and they hear the voice and they think somebody else is talking.

310
00:49:50,108 --> 00:49:54,705
There is so much confusion.

311
00:49:54,977 --> 00:50:04,303
In Merc. the fear comes in the night, that they are going to disintegrate

312
00:50:04,813 --> 00:50:12,744
and then I started putting questions like are you constipated, to confirm Alum.

313
00:50:12,988 --> 00:50:21,948
She said yes, lately I am constipated but not to the extent that you will have a confirmation.

314
00:50:22,223 --> 00:50:29,903
On the other hand do you have a salivation? Yes, I have a salivation but not so much etc.

315
00:50:30,146 --> 00:50:42,184
Do you have a bad taste? No metallic taste, no real problems with the teeth,

316
00:50:42,428 --> 00:50:53,453
no otitis, no impulses where we have to confirm Merc.

317
00:50:53,704 --> 00:51:08,303
And at the same time she could not confirm Alum. either.

318
00:51:08,446 --> 00:51:14,928
All the key symptoms of Alum. I put except of some constipation.

319
00:51:18,024 --> 00:51:25,186
When she entered the class and said I need attention.

320
00:51:25,453 --> 00:51:35,183
That takes the case finally towards Merc. I need the attention in order to speak.

321
00:51:36,706 --> 00:51:49,263
That with the night fear, though there are no impulses,

322
00:51:51,823 --> 00:52:04,623
we can say that the case goes towards Merc. but show me how many symptoms Merc. covers.

323
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:21,265
It has almost all her symptoms,

324
00:52:22,006 --> 00:52:33,726
even the repertorization will bring out Merc. as the remedy for her

325
00:52:33,826 --> 00:52:46,865
but not Phos. Phos. can aggravate that state and make you much more crazy.

326
00:52:49,425 --> 00:52:53,788
We will give Merc. What potency?

327
00:52:55,332 --> 00:53:18,108
Who says 50M? 10M? 1M? 200C? 30C? 12C?

328
00:53:18,626 --> 00:53:27,586
Of course you have to have a high potency for this case.

329
00:53:31,172 --> 00:53:50,108
200C is enough I think. Get her 200C. I would like to have a follow up at 14:30.

330
00:53:55,985 --> 00:54:08,947
I will just give you a report. A few things which I tested.

331
00:54:09,727 --> 00:54:18,423
She would look and not speak but she seemed to understand every question.

332
00:54:18,664 --> 00:54:25,338
I asked her what was the time, she looked her watch, it was 10:00 English time.

333
00:54:25,587 --> 00:54:32,228
She looked and said 10:00 in London and in Greece 12:00.

334
00:54:32,503 --> 00:54:37,764
She calculated the 2 hours difference and she gave me the information

335
00:54:37,864 --> 00:54:46,067
that is 12:00 Greek time while her watch was showing 10:00 English time.

336
00:54:46,308 --> 00:54:54,404
That was quite encouraging in the view of the fact that she was talking about demons and all that.

337
00:54:54,504 --> 00:54:56,723
This has stopped, she didn’t talk.

338
00:54:56,823 --> 00:54:59,705
I asked her several other questions, who she is,

339
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:09,455
what is the name of her father, of her husband etc. and she would answer correctly.

340
00:55:09,706 --> 00:55:18,415
She wanted to hold my hand and to be with her.

341
00:55:22,745 --> 00:55:28,655
I tried to stay as much as possible with her.

342
00:55:29,668 --> 00:55:43,461
Also, another point which was encouraging was that she was shouting quite strongly,

343
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:53,701
shrieking actually, which she has not done after the high dose of Merc. I gave her.

344
00:55:53,947 --> 00:56:04,451
And also she slept for about a minute or two.

345
00:56:04,705 --> 00:56:11,105
For 3 days as we said she has not been able to sleep at all.

346
00:56:11,344 --> 00:56:19,941
The moment I tried to leave she most probably felt deserted

347
00:56:21,221 --> 00:56:27,105
and she got up and the men could not hold her, she wanted to come to me.

348
00:56:27,205 --> 00:56:30,244
When they called me and I came back,

349
00:56:30,344 --> 00:56:40,828
she grabbed me and didn’t want to leave me and she kneeled down holding my legs...

350
00:56:53,133 --> 00:57:01,827
I don’t quite understand because she would not tell what she felt.

351
00:57:02,094 --> 00:57:09,407
Either she is not able to speak or to describe or she does not want because she is afraid.

352
00:57:09,507 --> 00:57:21,827
I received some information concerning her past and this happened after birth. After each birth.

353
00:57:26,424 --> 00:57:37,104
For me is not an aggressive behavior at least in my presence I haven’t seen any aggressiveness

354
00:57:37,347 --> 00:57:46,825
except of some thoughts which were coming some times, which shake her sometimes.

355
00:57:47,644 --> 00:58:03,214
Now the fact that she does not shriek because the shrieking is to get out what threatens inside.

356
00:58:03,465 --> 00:58:09,614
So if the shriek is not there and if she answers correctly the questions,

357
00:58:09,865 --> 00:58:15,504
that means she is getting better.

358
00:58:15,747 --> 00:58:25,644
Of course in such cases you cannot say that within a few hours the whole thing is over

359
00:58:25,744 --> 00:58:35,365
especially when we don’t know the depth of the problem and what causes it.

360
00:58:35,465 --> 00:58:41,347
I have been told that her mother has been mistreating her quite a lot,

361
00:58:41,614 --> 00:58:50,825
she was quite promiscuous and she was unloading on her behavior.

362
00:58:51,064 --> 00:59:00,814
God knows what’s inside the soul of that child!

363
00:59:01,004 --> 00:59:04,546
She seemed to need affection,

364
00:59:04,785 --> 00:59:19,736
she seemed to have some sexuality which is quite obvious but we will see.

365
00:59:22,572 --> 00:59:29,405
The problem here is that we don’t have a hospital yet here

366
00:59:29,505 --> 00:59:37,701
and so I have to meet everyone, everything that happens without hospital.

367
00:59:43,067 --> 00:59:58,705
This woman hasn’t slept at all for 3 nights. Last night also did not sleep.

368
00:59:58,946 --> 01:00:10,647
She was completely out and she would shriek, shout, trying to escape.

369
01:00:10,747 --> 01:00:17,147
They tried to contain her very powerful men would hold her.

370
01:00:17,432 --> 01:00:35,105
This is a really difficult situation that we had to deal with.

371
01:00:37,411 --> 01:00:41,921
We telephoned her husband of course who is coming.

372
01:00:42,021 --> 01:00:51,227
He knows the problem, this seems to be happening regularly

373
01:00:51,491 --> 01:00:58,661
but we don’t have enough information about the case.

374
01:01:00,444 --> 01:01:10,691
Concerning the remedy which we gave yesterday, I think that it did nothing.

375
01:01:10,945 --> 01:01:25,025
So the question is was it the right remedy or the wrong potency or not a potentized remedy?

376
01:01:25,164 --> 01:01:29,627
I went there, people will tell you what happened,

377
01:01:29,891 --> 01:01:41,804
she was in a terrible state and I said I feel was probably that the Merc. 200C

378
01:01:41,904 --> 01:01:45,251
which we gave here was a spoiled remedy.

379
01:01:45,505 --> 01:01:51,222
That means a remedy has stopped acting.

380
01:01:51,368 --> 01:02:01,224
Otherwise it should have some action which we didn’t see.

381
01:02:10,705 --> 01:02:23,266
– The girl last night, where you were interviewing and we were watching the video,

382
01:02:23,505 --> 01:02:27,617
she stood up as if the interview had something to do with her case.

383
01:02:27,868 --> 01:02:34,532
Was that an aggravation from Merc.?

384
01:02:34,632 --> 01:02:47,068
– No. This is one of the Merc. keynotes.

385
01:02:47,332 --> 01:02:54,397
Mental disturbances in Merc. make them shriek.

386
01:02:54,497 --> 01:03:01,905
The person feels like going out in the street and shriek.

387
01:03:10,108 --> 01:03:20,100
I gave her a higher potency of Merc. from my house and we will see what happens.

388
01:03:20,346 --> 01:03:26,746
Because in this case we should have had more information.

389
01:03:27,010 --> 01:03:35,460
Andrew who telephoned her husband says the husband seems to know the situation and he is coming over

390
01:03:35,711 --> 01:03:42,905
because who is going to accompany her, how is going to go back etc.

391
01:03:43,146 --> 01:03:47,745
Most probably the reason she came here was exactly that

392
01:03:48,025 --> 01:03:52,765
because she was quite sick and needed some treatment.

393
01:03:52,865 --> 01:04:03,385
And what she actually needed was my attention and all that. Anyhow we will see.

394
01:04:05,945 --> 01:04:15,664
– May I ask you a question? The patient is actually in an acute psychotic state.

395
01:04:15,905 --> 01:04:23,185
I would like to ask you if you have experienced in the past patients

396
01:04:23,285 --> 01:04:27,385
in these acute psychotic states with Homeopathy.

397
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:39,695
– Yes, I have. Acute insanity especially if it’s not long continued.

398
01:04:39,946 --> 01:04:48,140
Acute insanity can be managed by Homeopathy within 2-3 days.

399
01:04:48,388 --> 01:04:56,335
You will see this crisis subsiding. I had this experience.

400
01:04:59,385 --> 01:05:09,135
Anyhow with the right remedy. You give the wrong remedy it will continue.

401
01:05:09,386 --> 01:05:20,388
The other problem that we have, because we open the bottles and give a dose,

402
01:05:20,655 --> 01:05:28,825
we open again and give another dose and at a certain moment this bottle is inactive.

403
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:36,505
What has happened is because of opening and closing the remedy has been neutralized.

404
01:05:41,625 --> 01:05:46,745
I had this experience many times.

405
01:05:48,132 --> 01:05:57,346
In Seattle [patient name], one the students was collapsing,

406
01:05:57,585 --> 01:06:03,492
he was sitting there in the first row, we were in the hotel having the seminar,

407
01:06:03,746 --> 01:06:12,184
he was collapsing with constant diarrheas, I saw him in that state I said to go upstairs,

408
01:06:12,431 --> 01:06:18,584
we took him upstairs to the room and I looked a few things

409
01:06:18,831 --> 01:06:29,071
and I asked the students who has Carb-v. 1M.

410
01:06:29,347 --> 01:06:32,418
Somebody gave it to me, we went upstairs,

411
01:06:32,664 --> 01:06:36,258
I gave him and I came down to continue the teaching.

412
01:06:36,504 --> 01:06:45,364
After 1,5 hour I went upstairs I saw him and he said he was worse.

413
01:06:45,464 --> 01:06:52,257
And because he was a homeopath himself, you remember [name] the naturopath,

414
01:06:52,508 --> 01:07:02,497
tall, bald guy, he said I think I am Ars.

415
01:07:03,012 --> 01:07:12,226
because I am afraid I am going to die and I am totally exhausted and it’s worse and worse.

416
01:07:12,465 --> 01:07:17,246
He almost persuaded me.

417
01:07:17,346 --> 01:07:21,765
But I said if he is a homeopath and he knows the symptoms

418
01:07:21,865 --> 01:07:31,754
that means he overstates the fear of death in order to sound as if he is Ars.

419
01:07:31,854 --> 01:07:39,785
So I said ok. I won’t give you Ars. I will give you again the remedy

420
01:07:40,024 --> 01:07:43,374
and if in 2 minutes you don’t feel better I will give you Ars.

421
01:07:43,625 --> 01:07:53,004
So I went down and I asked if anybody else had Carb-v. the same potency.

422
01:07:53,104 --> 01:07:59,504
Somebody came and said yes. I went upstairs, gave him the remedy and I wait.

423
01:07:59,747 --> 01:08:04,244
Less than 2 minutes he said I feel better.

424
01:08:04,344 --> 01:08:14,484
In 1,5 hour he was driving his car back home.

425
01:08:14,584 --> 01:08:19,465
But if I had listened to him, remedy wrong,

426
01:08:19,704 --> 01:08:29,187
no the remedy was not wrong I was sure how Carb-v. would not act when the picture was Carb-v.?

427
01:08:29,705 --> 01:08:37,624
Many times being having not that experience you think the remedy is wrong

428
01:08:37,904 --> 01:08:43,267
and then you go ahead and give another remedy and another remedy.

429
01:08:43,534 --> 01:08:50,704
But actually the remedy was not properly potentized or the remedy has been spoiled.

430
01:08:50,952 --> 01:08:55,211
And I have seen that with the pharmacy in Athens.

431
01:08:55,311 --> 01:09:01,988
I remember I prescribed Phos., Rhus-t.... Phos. 10M; nothing.

432
01:09:02,388 --> 01:09:07,240
Where did you buy it from? This pharmacy.

433
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:12,639
Ok, go to that pharmacy and buy Phos. 10M and take it and tell me.

434
01:09:12,739 --> 01:09:20,665
Fantastic! I phoned them and told your Phos. 10M is finished, change it.

435
01:09:20,912 --> 01:09:24,259
With Rhus-t., Sulph., the same.

436
01:09:24,505 --> 01:09:26,032
I have seen this again and again

437
01:09:26,519 --> 01:09:31,106
but you have to know very well what you are doing before you can do that of course.

438
01:09:31,386 --> 01:09:38,531
Because the first thing you think is I have given the wrong remedy, of course.

439
01:09:38,924 --> 01:09:42,161
And that’s one of the problems we have.
