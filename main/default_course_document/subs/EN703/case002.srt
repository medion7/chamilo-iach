1
00:00:19,338 --> 00:00:27,770
This is a case of a child of a medical doctor from Portugal

2
00:00:28,682 --> 00:00:45,179
who is not an experienced homeopath and has prescribed for his child and I will read his report.

3
00:00:49,363 --> 00:00:54,257
- She has been treated by [doctor’s name].

4
00:00:56,121 --> 00:01:05,577
She has been treated by her, who is a teacher of mine.

5
00:01:08,241 --> 00:01:13,096
Because there are no schools of Homeopathy in Portugal, unfortunately.

6
00:01:14,082 --> 00:01:28,423
– Sophia was born 25 weeks premature. We have to go a little bit fast.

7
00:01:29,014 --> 00:01:37,089
Due to an obvious delay of her neurological evolution she was seen in a rehabilitation center

8
00:01:37,496 --> 00:01:46,966
when she was 11 months old and neurological consultant moderate diagnosed cerebral palsy.

9
00:01:51,672 --> 00:02:00,397
She began homeopathic treatment with Nat-m., due to chronic constipation and irritability and she improved much.

10
00:02:00,752 --> 00:02:10,265
She had in the meanwhile impetigo and several bouts of bronchiolitis treat with Ant-t.

11
00:02:11,302 --> 00:02:25,081
But in February 1998 she had a left tonsillitis that progressed right and then asthma that didn’t respond to Ant-t., Sulph. or Tub.

12
00:02:25,462 --> 00:02:31,573
She had to be admitted to hospital where she was treated with steroids because she responded to nothing else.

13
00:02:32,173 --> 00:02:46,924
After discharge from hospital she began to cough during sleep, waking from sleep and had aversion to drinking water.

14
00:02:47,291 --> 00:03:02,280
She improved much with Lach. 3LM and then some older symptoms reappeared like sour belching after eating, constipation and pica.(paper)

15
00:03:03,026 --> 00:03:12,835
I should have waited longer but not believing Lach. to be her similimum, I gave her Lyc. and then Calc. but didn’t help her very much.

16
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:29,337
Since she is restless and obstinate child, fears animals, specifically dogs, had frequent bouts of lower respiratory infections,

17
00:03:30,934 --> 00:03:43,321
tuberculic eyelashes and likes very much to tear paper I decided to try Tub. again, 30C.

18
00:03:44,196 --> 00:03:52,196
The very next day around midnight, during sleep, she initiated sudden for the first time in her life, focal convulsions.

19
00:03:53,615 --> 00:04:04,445
Left arm and leg. Since the pupils were dilated I gave her a single dose of Bell. 30C,

20
00:04:05,457 --> 00:04:14,819
according to her doctor and there was an aggravation of the convulsions with opisthotonus and jerking of the head to the right side.

21
00:04:15,781 --> 00:04:21,517
In hospital after the convulsions stopped, there was an aggravation of another formal symptom,

22
00:04:22,117 --> 00:04:31,320
startling easily from the fright, noise at 4 a.m.

23
00:04:32,065 --> 00:04:40,640
These symptoms I am reading now, does she still have them now?

24
00:04:41,096 --> 00:04:47,907
-The easily startling yes. She gets frightened very easily.
-She wakes up at 4 a.m.?

25
00:04:48,298 --> 00:05:00,833
You write here that startling easily from fright, noise and at 4 a.m. she had a high fever that was suppressed by antipyretic.

26
00:05:01,377 --> 00:05:04,760
That was only one time. She does not have fever in the morning.

27
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:12,281
- No, it was just that time.
- She began treatment with carbamazepine,

28
00:05:12,817 --> 00:05:18,656
1 month later she had another bout of partial convulsions and according to her doctor

29
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:26,503
I gave her a single dose of Stram. 9C, 30C, 200C but 2 hours later she was still having them,

30
00:05:27,264 --> 00:05:31,306
so I had to treat the convulsions with diazepam.

31
00:05:31,738 --> 00:05:40,426
Next morning she was very frightened, like she was seeing monsters and was unable to recognize her mother for a while.

32
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:55,137
She likes bathing very much. Craves bread, fruit and fat.

33
00:05:56,394 --> 00:06:04,906
She is happy and a lovely child and like company, to be the focus of attention and to be carried.

34
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:10,996
Consolation improves her symptoms much. She chokes frequently on swallowing.

35
00:06:30,611 --> 00:06:38,275
She had fear of machine noises, animals and is startled easily from fright and loud noises.

36
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:44,810
She used to bite her own arms when contradicted. Is this symptom still there?

37
00:06:48,683 --> 00:06:59,796
- – I think not anymore.
- – Sometimes diarrhea, alternated with constipation.

38
00:07:00,364 --> 00:07:05,836
– That’s not recently also. She used to be constipated, now she is not.

39
00:07:06,548 --> 00:07:19,539
– She is frightened easily. I gave her Lach. 3LM for 2 weeks but there was no positive response.

40
00:07:19,954 --> 00:07:30,211
Constipation did not improve. In the meanwhile she had the third bout of seizures, even under carbamazepine.

41
00:07:30,876 --> 00:07:35,762
Her doctor advised me to initiate Nat-m. again;

42
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:49,506
there was frank amelioration on constipation, fears, easily startled and resolution of a tonsillitis, she had a few days after initiating Nat-m.

43
00:07:49,986 --> 00:07:57,650
However, this winter the lower respiratory infection showed up again with much rattling of transparent mucus,

44
00:07:58,257 --> 00:08:13,698
wheezing and persistent coughing with 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. aggravation, getting better after expectorating and worse from crying and eating.

45
00:08:14,178 --> 00:08:25,865
After 6 weeks therapy with Nat-m. she was still having these symptoms so I changed to Kali-c. 1 LM, after 3 doses did not improve,

46
00:08:26,824 --> 00:08:34,137
she had to be given Ventolin because she was exhausted from coughing and not sleeping.

47
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:50,897
My last trial was with Phos. LM but on the third night of therapy during sleep, even medicated with carbamazepine she had convulsions again.

48
00:08:51,384 --> 00:09:03,209
This time very dramatically she bites her tongue, begins to vomit, food got stuck on the throat and she became cyanotic and breathless.

49
00:09:03,552 --> 00:09:11,599
Thanks to God we were able to remove the food and reanimate her.

50
00:09:16,632 --> 00:09:30,855
This is the report from her father and as you see the child is not able to walk.

51
00:09:32,807 --> 00:09:41,102
The child is now...
- She will be next month 4 years old.

52
00:09:42,201 --> 00:09:50,709
– She is under antiepileptic drugs.
– She is still under carbamazepine.

53
00:09:51,555 --> 00:10:03,868
– And during the epileptic attack can you describe how she looks like? It is only on one side still?

54
00:10:05,484 --> 00:10:10,996
– Normally she has convulsions during sleep or immediately after sleep.

55
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:23,004
And the convulsions always begin on the left side. First she becomes unconscious.

56
00:10:23,895 --> 00:10:37,201
– Without trembling?
– Then the left arm begins to tremble, then the left leg and then it becomes generalized.

57
00:10:40,281 --> 00:10:49,417
– Trembling or convulsions?
– Convulsions. But it begins with a slight tremble on the left.

58
00:10:50,121 --> 00:11:17,438
– Slight tremor. Show her mother. Do it. Was anyone epileptic in your family or hers?
– Not at all.

59
00:11:21,526 --> 00:11:29,127
– Was anything like tuberculosis in your family or hers?

60
00:11:29,568 --> 00:11:40,344
– My mother had tuberculosis. And her sister also had tuberculosis.

61
00:11:50,936 --> 00:12:01,351
– Is she behaving the way she behaves here? That means the moment her mother put her down she started crying.

62
00:12:01,863 --> 00:12:06,815
– Sometimes she has these violent tantrums.

63
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:19,302
– She likes to be in that position like this or this is best for her?

64
00:12:20,662 --> 00:12:29,719
– She normally crawls. She is very restless and likes to crawl.

65
00:12:33,487 --> 00:12:47,455
– How about her teething?
– Just irritability.

66
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:51,071
– The teeth are not out at all?

67
00:12:58,086 --> 00:12:57,037
– They’re all out but she had no ailments concerning her teeth.

68
00:12:57,445 --> 00:13:13,652
No fever, no convulsions, no diarrhea. Teeth came later than usual.

69
00:13:17,749 --> 00:13:26,125
– She was vaccinated?
– She was vaccinated twice against poliomyelitis.

70
00:13:26,436 --> 00:13:35,196
The first time she got fever and the second time she got a bout of lower respiratory infection.

71
00:13:40,308 --> 00:13:42,436
– The triple vaccine?

72
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:50,739
– She has done it once but then we had to abolish completely the vaccination because when she had this vaccination,

73
00:13:51,155 --> 00:13:58,939
the triple vaccination, she had some sort of spasms.

74
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:03,051
– After the vaccination, she had the first spasm? For how long?

75
00:14:03,595 --> 00:14:10,588
– They were not complete convulsions. They were spasms. Like tetanic spasms on the left side.

76
00:14:13,051 --> 00:14:18,979
Her doctor gave her Sulph. and with Sulph. they disappeared completely.

77
00:14:20,891 --> 00:14:26,547
So we stopped completely to vaccinate her.

78
00:14:27,843 --> 00:14:31,963
– With her eyes? She has some strabismus?

79
00:14:33,619 --> 00:14:39,755
– It looks like strabismus, according to her eye doctor, it looks like strabismus but it’s not real strabismus.

80
00:14:41,251 --> 00:14:55,818
– What is it? The right eye goes inside.

81
00:14:57,882 --> 00:15:04,202
– The lesion is not on the nerves it’s on the brain cortex.

82
00:15:07,305 --> 00:15:14,786
It’s not a real strabismus. The eye doesn’t move to the right side.

83
00:15:19,778 --> 00:15:28,362
– But the right eye is convergent to the left.

84
00:15:34,513 --> 00:15:32,949
Except of these remedies have you given any other remedies?

85
00:15:33,444 --> 00:15:42,452
You don’t mention Sulph. here. You gave Sulph. in the beginning, you say, but you don’t mention it.

86
00:15:44,367 --> 00:15:50,909
She was given Sulph. when she had the spasms after vaccinations.

87
00:15:51,252 --> 00:15:56,012
Probably I forgot to write.

88
00:15:57,972 --> 00:16:10,891
– On her previous history we have, due to respiratory depressions she was under mechanical ventilation for 17 days.

89
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:17,579
On the 11th day of her life she had STA. What is STA?

90
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:35,515
– Staphylococcus epidermidis, sepsis.

91
00:16:36,251 --> 00:16:41,891
– And a great right ventricular hemorrhage was detected echographically.

92
00:16:42,274 --> 00:16:53,690
The last TF echography was performed in October 1995, showing a slight bilateral ventricular dilatation.

93
00:16:54,251 --> 00:17:12,722
She was discharged from the hospital on the 113th day of life, almost 4 months, her weight was 1.860 grams.

94
00:17:21,854 --> 00:17:25,525
– I think there is another symptom that I forgot to tell you.

95
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:52,029
She shows very often grinding of teeth. Sometimes during sleep. And she has hiccup very often.

96
00:17:55,051 --> 00:17:57,634
– When it was the last time she had fever?

97
00:17:59,199 --> 00:18:15,408
– April this year, we went to Barcelona for vacations and I got a cold and she got a bronchiolitis and viral pneumonia.

98
00:18:15,991 --> 00:18:23,799
I saw the X-ray, it didn’t show infiltrates, I think it was just a bronchiolitis but the doctors in the hospital told us

99
00:18:24,446 --> 00:18:28,715
that it was a viral pneumonia.

100
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:32,793
– And she took antibiotics?
– Yes.

101
00:18:33,814 --> 00:18:42,366
– Do you know what is the condition if you don’t give the antiepileptic drug?

102
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:49,367
Have you left her without the antiepileptic drug to see what is the real condition?

103
00:18:49,659 --> 00:18:53,967
That means every how many days she may have the convulsion.

104
00:18:54,295 --> 00:18:59,129
– Well, if we don’t give her antiepileptic drugs the convulsions don’t stop at all.

105
00:19:04,298 --> 00:19:07,854
And it’s very dangerous.

106
00:19:09,255 --> 00:19:13,980
– Has she ever been in a status epilepticus? Because you mention here, 2 hours she was...

107
00:19:22,566 --> 00:19:23,702
- The first time we tried to control the convulsion with homeopathic remedies and we waited about one hour

108
00:19:24,453 --> 00:19:28,278
and a half and she was still having convulsions.

109
00:19:28,659 --> 00:19:31,606
– And then she ended up in the hospital?
– Yes.

110
00:19:31,866 --> 00:19:35,926
– And then what did they give during that time? Valium?

111
00:19:40,292 --> 00:19:53,042
– Yes. But now we have to solve this problem with a different drug because Valium was not working very well.

112
00:19:53,836 --> 00:20:03,963
In one of these bouts of convulsions she received 25mg of diazepam and she was still having convulsions.

113
00:20:04,294 --> 00:20:11,764
So we changed to another drug that they use in England the pediatricians, which is midazolam.

114
00:20:12,104 --> 00:20:18,926
A very small dose in the nose and 5 minutes later the convulsion stopped.

115
00:20:19,316 --> 00:20:22,658
– You give it during the convulsion.
– Yes.

116
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:32,586
– So, you control actually the convulsions and don’t give before the convulsions, regularly.

117
00:20:32,892 --> 00:20:40,987
– The preventive medicine is carbamazepine. She takes it regularly to prevent the convulsions.

118
00:20:41,267 --> 00:20:46,468
– But if the convulsions still come, then you use the other drug.
– Yes.

119
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:52,084
– Which actually controls.

120
00:20:52,866 --> 00:20:56,689
– But I have to tell you another thing that is not written on the paper.

121
00:20:59,271 --> 00:21:15,215
Once, she was vomiting very much during the convulsions and I gave her Hyosc. and the convulsion stopped for 5 minutes

122
00:21:16,283 --> 00:21:23,119
and then restarted and I tried to give her another dose but it was useless.

123
00:21:25,947 --> 00:21:40,927
Concerning her character; she is very restless, she likes movement very much and she is very jealous.

124
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:51,606
– How do you know she is very jealous?

125
00:21:54,649 --> 00:21:56,356
– She has no brothers, she is my first child.

126
00:21:57,921 --> 00:22:12,728
She is in a special school and the professors and school teachers say she is very jealous.

127
00:22:13,547 --> 00:22:17,208
She wants all the attention for herself.

128
00:22:19,282 --> 00:22:27,310
Sometimes when I am caressing her mother she tries to show some temper.

129
00:22:33,653 --> 00:22:41,389
– She is too hot. Is she very hot?
– She is normal.

130
00:22:41,883 --> 00:22:44,679
– How much water she drinks?

131
00:22:45,463 --> 00:22:55,071
– When it’s very hot she drinks often water but she prefers juices.

132
00:23:01,074 --> 00:23:08,503
When it’s very hot she drinks water but normally she doesn’t like it so much, she prefers juices.

133
00:23:14,231 --> 00:23:22,179
– If you make a noise she will get startled?
– Yes, sometimes she does.

134
00:23:35,238 --> 00:23:36,306
When we are travelling, if a motorbike passes by, she startles and when she hears dogs barking she gets frightened very much.

135
00:23:36,963 --> 00:23:41,824
– Is she afraid of dogs?
– Yes.

136
00:23:42,456 --> 00:23:44,958
– Very much or isn’t it obvious?

137
00:23:46,247 --> 00:23:50,428
– I think the main problem is that she startles very much when she hears the dogs barking.

138
00:23:53,514 --> 00:24:04,579
– What about during convulsions, do you observe in her face making grimaces or distortion?

139
00:24:05,106 --> 00:24:22,483
– No, definitely not. The eyes turn to the left but this is normal when people have convulsions.

140
00:24:38,021 --> 00:24:44,348
– Do you know if there is itching in the nose, does she scratch her nose at all?

141
00:24:46,883 --> 00:24:56,167
– Yes, very much. Sometimes the eyes also.

142
00:25:10,863 --> 00:25:21,427
– Do you know if she has any pinworms? Have you noticed pinworms in the stool?

143
00:25:24,074 --> 00:25:31,958
– We have her stool analyzed and it showed no parasites, no worms.

144
00:25:34,073 --> 00:25:47,667
– Itching in the anus?
– No. She is also very obstinate child.

145
00:25:49,853 --> 00:25:52,955
– If she wants something you have to give it to her.

146
00:25:53,781 --> 00:25:58,658
– We can put her glasses 30 times, 30 times she removes the glasses.

147
00:25:59,265 --> 00:26:17,606
You can put her the shoes and she removes her shoes. She also likes to strike and to pinch.

148
00:26:18,044 --> 00:26:25,822
And we say please don’t do it and she goes on doing it as often as she wants.

149
00:26:28,332 --> 00:26:32,674
When we tell her don’t do it she does it.

150
00:26:37,479 --> 00:26:47,196
– She makes sure she will do it. Sophia! Attention!

151
00:26:50,324 --> 00:26:58,411
How is it in your language? Aten??o!

152
00:27:06,211 --> 00:27:16,627
If you tell her bring me this, will she try to do it? She will understand first of all?

153
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:28,803
– She understands a lot of things but she normally doesn’t fulfill orders.

154
00:27:31,123 --> 00:27:34,874
Her mother says she fulfills sometimes orders.

155
00:27:38,171 --> 00:27:50,651
– Is there any excessive perspiration?
– No excessive perspiration, no perspiration at night, during sleep.

156
00:27:50,995 --> 00:27:57,419
– What food does she like most?
– Fruits and bread.

157
00:27:58,059 --> 00:28:10,918
– And milk products.
– She likes cold milk and yoghurt also. Cheese.

158
00:28:14,688 --> 00:28:39,605
– You mention somewhere here that she used to like paper.
– She eats paper, sand.

159
00:28:50,661 --> 00:28:57,732
– She likes these very much? I mean whenever she finds a paper she will start biting it?
– Yes.

160
00:29:00,053 --> 00:29:06,037
– Have you tried to see if she likes chalk?
– No, we didn’t try.

161
00:29:06,684 --> 00:29:19,388
– Can we give her a piece of chalk see if she likes? If she will put it in her mouth, we’ll see.

162
00:29:20,124 --> 00:29:34,739
In her hands. She bites? I mean she can bite or she doesn’t have much strength in her jaws?

163
00:29:35,346 --> 00:29:39,227
– She doesn’t have normal strength.

164
00:29:39,746 --> 00:29:49,962
– But she can chew for instance meat?
– We don’t give her meat. She never ate it.

165
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:56,930
– You are vegetarians?
– Not completely vegetarians but sometimes we eat fish.

166
00:30:00,065 --> 00:30:10,266
She eats fish almost every day. We both eat fish, 2-3 times in a week.

167
00:30:10,714 --> 00:30:21,690
– So you are vegetarians.
– Not completely. But she likes vegetables very much. She likes vegetarian food.

168
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:38,640
– Take the chalk from her now. No specific liking.

169
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:49,305
– But she likes to tear paper very much. When she has a magazine or a newspaper she tears the paper and tries to eat it.

170
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:55,088
– Show me!
– That’s very typical of her.

171
00:31:00,265 --> 00:31:03,944
– Now the constipation is not there.

172
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:14,320
– No. When she began taking carbamazepine her bowels were not functioning very well

173
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:22,720
but now I think she is used to the drug and the bowels are functioning daily.

174
00:31:26,841 --> 00:31:33,544
I think at that time the constipation was more related to the drug than to her constitution.

175
00:31:35,463 --> 00:31:42,568
– How frequently will she have a convulsion now? Once a day, once a week?

176
00:31:43,152 --> 00:31:54,351
– She used to have convulsions every month, once a month, but she had the last convulsion 2 months ago.

177
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:03,631
– Does she show affection?
– Yes.

178
00:32:06,622 --> 00:32:17,815
– Do you know if she likes sour things like lemon or vinegar?
– Lemon, she likes.

179
00:32:18,294 --> 00:32:32,614
– Sweets?
– Sweets, she likes. Lemon she likes but vinegar and sour food, we don’t eat them.

180
00:32:34,742 --> 00:32:45,742
– How much food will she eat?
– She has a good appetite. And she likes to eat very much.

181
00:32:47,614 --> 00:32:56,294
– Can you describe to me for instance you give her to eat and after half an hour she wants again to eat something?
– No.

182
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:04,437
– How many times she eats?
– 4 times a day.

183
00:33:07,854 --> 00:33:10,701
– In between she does not ask?

184
00:33:11,494 --> 00:33:24,293
– Not in between because we usually don’t give food between the meals because we think it’s not right.

185
00:33:24,629 --> 00:33:29,773
– Before convulsions does she make any noise?

186
00:33:30,213 --> 00:33:42,269
– No noises. Sometimes she makes this with the throat ...

187
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:48,941
- What about talking at all? There is no word she can pronounce?

188
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:58,804
– She can say hello but her speech is very much delayed due to this cerebral palsy.

189
00:33:59,028 --> 00:34:03,732
– She cannot say any word actually, mama, father...

190
00:34:07,052 --> 00:34:26,292
- No. We are really treating her with a special formal physical therapy and she improved very much, but her speech is still very retarded.

191
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:30,643
– Call her!

192
00:34:30,979 --> 00:35:01,435
– Sophia! Normally she is much more active than she is now, because she didn’t sleep very well. There is this time difference.

193
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:15,171
– Sweets? She likes?
– Yes, she does.

194
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:22,586
– What does she mostly eat, fish? Fish is her main food and what else?

195
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:43,537
– Fish, soya, tofu, cheese, eggs, lots of vegetables ...

196
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:55,308
- Mostly out of what you say, what do you think she likes the most?
– What she likes most is fruits and bread.

197
00:36:04,611 --> 00:36:09,458
– Can she eat only bread if you give her?
– Yes.

198
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:16,346
– Is there any salivation from her mouth?

199
00:36:16,802 --> 00:36:31,162
– Yes, she salivates very much but normally these children with cerebral palsy have this problem. She has a lot of saliva.

200
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:38,489
– But I don’t see saliva running now, since she is here. In the night in sleep?

201
00:36:39,362 --> 00:36:46,569
– I think she salivates more during the day, not especially in the night.

202
00:36:52,553 --> 00:36:57,737
– You said she likes to be carried.
– She likes very much to be carried.

203
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:09,873
– That means if she is excited or nervous or restless you have to carry her otherwise she will keep on shouting and screaming?

204
00:37:10,072 --> 00:37:13,449
– Yes, that’s right.

205
00:37:16,665 --> 00:37:24,153
– She pushes you. If you touch her she will push?
– No, she likes very much to be touched.

206
00:37:26,713 --> 00:37:29,512
– To be caressed?
– Yes.

207
00:37:31,448 --> 00:37:41,128
– By anybody or by her mother and yourself? If I try to touch her she won’t react?

208
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:46,808
– That depends on the person. She likes especially to be caressed by her parents,

209
00:37:51,328 --> 00:37:59,200
but she accepts to be caressed by other persons, but that depends on the persons.

210
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:04,543
– If we are present, nobody...

211
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:11,376
- Nobody will touch her.
– She cries.

212
00:38:17,007 --> 00:38:22,911
– When she is crying she likes to be caressed by her parents and nobody else.

213
00:38:23,423 --> 00:38:28,616
But just when she is crying. When she is normal, people can caress.

214
00:38:28,927 --> 00:38:35,919
– Do you think she likes salt more than usual?
– She doesn’t like food without salt.

215
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:47,927
– She behaves now normally or she is quieter, or less quiet than normal?

216
00:38:49,087 --> 00:38:54,151
– She is usually more active than she is now.

217
00:38:54,902 --> 00:38:58,397
– Now you think she is exhausted because she didn’t sleep.

218
00:38:58,943 --> 00:39:04,271
– She didn’t sleep well and there is this jetlag, this time difference...

219
00:39:09,175 --> 00:39:14,221
She is more active usually but normally she goes around the room and...

220
00:39:15,246 --> 00:39:18,678
- Ok. Thank you.
– Thank you very much.

221
00:39:19,142 --> 00:39:30,611
This is one of the cases that we are going to be discussing theoretically how we handle cases that are under allopathic treatment.

222
00:39:30,819 --> 00:39:44,475
This is an example case of what we mean, we have not spoken yet, but we will see how we handle such a case.

223
00:39:58,154 --> 00:40:07,138
What do you think about this treatment so far? Homeopathic treatment.

224
00:40:16,561 --> 00:40:23,362
There is a problem, right? With this homeopathic treatment so far there is a problem,

225
00:40:23,585 --> 00:40:36,937
because we can say that the homeopathic treatment has not stopped the progress of the disease.

226
00:40:37,146 --> 00:40:47,162
The disease has progressed and quite fast I would say, towards a deeper level.

227
00:40:47,897 --> 00:40:58,689
We have a case where we have severe retardation complicated with epilepsy.

228
00:40:59,329 --> 00:41:05,105
And the epileptic fits being constant is not a good sign at all.

229
00:41:05,345 --> 00:41:15,768
It means that of course we don’t ask for the encephalograms, which we believe they have done.

230
00:41:16,745 --> 00:41:22,272
When was the last EEG?

231
00:41:24,696 --> 00:41:35,640
– It was 6 months ago. She had the first when she was 6 months old and then 6 months ago she got another one.

232
00:41:35,921 --> 00:41:40,463
But the EEG’s didn’t show any focus on the epilepsy.

233
00:41:41,431 --> 00:41:45,727
– They didn’t show any focal point?
– Not at all.

234
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:54,424
– It was generalized.
– They didn’t show any changes. And she had a brain CT then.

235
00:41:55,784 --> 00:42:02,158
We could just see a marked dilatation and deformation of the right ventricle.

236
00:42:10,455 --> 00:42:23,142
– As we have been discussing before, in order to have a real effect upon a case you have to start the case with the right remedy.

237
00:42:25,207 --> 00:42:30,919
Unfortunately nothing else will work.

238
00:42:31,222 --> 00:42:39,374
And then you have to follow it up with, again, the right remedy and then the third remedy has to be correct as well,

239
00:42:39,702 --> 00:42:42,863
before we have real effects.

240
00:42:43,110 --> 00:43:00,398
Otherwise we see a superficial kind of amelioration of certain symptoms but the actual focal point of the disease is progressing,

241
00:43:00,885 --> 00:43:11,413
is going deeper and deeper and sometimes is helped by the wrong homeopathic treatment to develop much faster.

242
00:43:12,917 --> 00:43:22,493
So, from that point of view we can say that Homeopathy is not so innocent, as we like to present it.

243
00:43:22,861 --> 00:43:38,668
It cannot have side effects like the allopathic drugs but it can push the disease deeper, faster than normally will go.

244
00:43:39,749 --> 00:43:52,404
Once it does not stop the progress and it does not improve, then, if there are changes, these changes are negative.

245
00:43:53,540 --> 00:44:06,860
The changes are going towards the mental emotional sphere and also the central nervous system.

246
00:44:07,652 --> 00:44:17,397
So we have to be very careful when we prescribe especially in such sensitive cases.

247
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:26,092
We have to think very much before we decide on a remedy.

248
00:44:32,748 --> 00:44:40,498
– The convulsions they are from the very beginning, from birth or they developed after treatment?

249
00:44:42,283 --> 00:44:53,618
– The convulsions started 1 year ago but she began to be treated homeopathically probably 2 and a half years ago.

250
00:44:53,826 --> 00:45:04,859
She was having Nat-m. – Lach., Nat-m., Tub.
– Yes, Tub. also before the convulsions.

251
00:45:06,226 --> 00:45:14,738
The first bout of convulsions was 24 hours after we gave her 1 single dose of Tub.

252
00:45:17,963 --> 00:45:20,763
– They remembered this.

253
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:31,370
And you will understand in the analysis what I mean when I say that once you prescribe prematurely a remedy,

254
00:45:31,835 --> 00:45:42,876
which may be indicated later on, this remedy is going to bring about disturbance, not cure.

255
00:45:43,253 --> 00:45:55,205
You understand what I say? You have to take into consideration always as much as possible,

256
00:45:55,445 --> 00:46:06,756
the totality and because the totality is never covered by one remedy, you find the best possible remedy.

257
00:46:07,077 --> 00:46:15,827
And then you are within the rules. But if on the beginning of a case,

258
00:46:16,221 --> 00:46:28,437
let us say you cannot see clearly the remedy and then you say since the father or the mother had tuberculosis

259
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:35,475
and she is grinding her teeth why not giving to this child Tub.?

260
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:48,796
This was the thinking and it is a good thinking because it could have been given a mixture of 25 remedies, which would be much worse.

261
00:46:49,163 --> 00:46:54,187
Now you will have a complete masking of the case.

262
00:46:54,651 --> 00:47:01,339
Still this particular case is masked because of the antiepileptic drugs.

263
00:47:01,563 --> 00:47:11,914
But even if on the top of this you have given 20 remedies to take every day, you cannot find anything.

264
00:47:14,186 --> 00:47:23,066
– I would like to know from the mother the complete state of mind, her emotional aspect during the 9 months of the pregnancy.

265
00:47:23,635 --> 00:47:27,355
What did affect her, what emotions were very strong in her,

266
00:47:27,604 --> 00:47:33,075
what happened to her personal life and was her basic feeling during those 9 months.

267
00:47:33,314 --> 00:47:36,074
Because I feel that it has a lot to do with the child,

268
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:45,259
which has been born with cerebral palsy with so many recurrent infections within her first year of life.

269
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:51,842
– We planned this child, wished her very much.

270
00:47:52,281 --> 00:48:03,354
During the 6 months of pregnancy my wife was very anxious, we had some financial problems, she had problems at work and was extremely anxious.

271
00:48:04,161 --> 00:48:11,385
She was being treated with Lyc. during her pregnancy by an homeopath.

272
00:48:16,289 --> 00:48:30,945
I think she suffered a lot during her pregnancy and she showed some craving of sardines which is a very typical fat fish in Portugal.

273
00:48:31,624 --> 00:48:34,697
– She craved for sardines?
– Yes.

274
00:48:35,001 --> 00:48:42,644
– And you never gave Nat-m.?
– No, she was just taking Lyc.

275
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:59,811
– This is why in the course that we give, we give the essential parts of Materia Medica because I have found out that what happens is;

276
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:10,281
students are given a lot of information about different remedies, they cram this information and in the end all remedies look alike.

277
00:49:12,593 --> 00:49:22,368
What is the use of that? Somebody has to tell them these are basic things you have to take into consideration.

278
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:30,872
If you have a mother who has been suffering a lot, that means she is under stress and she desires sardines,

279
00:49:31,193 --> 00:49:40,104
that means salty fish, the remedy most probably is Nat-m., not Lyc.

280
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:49,663
Because if that was Lyc. the symptomatology would be different and the character of the mother would be different.

281
00:49:52,079 --> 00:50:02,768
– But there is a special rubric that says sardines desire Cycl. and Verat. not Nat-m.

282
00:50:03,032 --> 00:50:10,255
– Yes, but it’s very simple what I think.

283
00:50:10,631 --> 00:50:19,336
Desires fish and desires salt. Which is the remedy that desires fish and salt?

284
00:50:19,631 --> 00:50:35,751
It’s one remedy. Nat-m. Salty fish Nat-s. also. Nit-ac. Is also salty fish.

285
00:50:36,095 --> 00:50:43,710
So the repertory is not everything but here you use common sense.

286
00:50:44,127 --> 00:50:49,510
He says she developed very important thing.

287
00:50:49,782 --> 00:51:00,982
When under stress you develop a special desire that means I don’t get elements of that food which I cannot absorb.

288
00:51:01,335 --> 00:51:08,005
Of that food which I crave, therefore I take it and I put it out.

289
00:51:25,436 --> 00:51:29,980
I am not able to correct all the repertory of course.

290
00:51:31,972 --> 00:51:51,283
But it is interesting that the first remedy the child gets is Nat-m. and the father says under Nat-m. the child did well.

291
00:51:51,717 --> 00:52:00,540
Where it did not do well? Afterwards, where Lach. and Tub. were given.

292
00:52:00,796 --> 00:52:08,347
That means the time for Tub. is not there but there are indications for Tub.

293
00:52:08,619 --> 00:52:16,196
Then you better wait until the full picture of Tub. is prominent.

294
00:52:17,187 --> 00:52:24,323
Because grinding of the teeth, we have several remedies.

295
00:52:24,572 --> 00:52:32,147
We have Bell. very strongly, we have Cina very strongly, Stram. very strongly.

296
00:52:32,715 --> 00:52:46,578
Grinding teeth during sleep Apis, Bell., Cina, Tub., Ars.

297
00:52:53,027 --> 00:53:05,570
How do we know the grinding of the teeth is Tub. and not Cina? It’s not enough.

298
00:53:11,147 --> 00:53:18,074
She doesn’t have worms. Just because she does not have worms it doesn’t mean anything.

299
00:53:32,137 --> 00:53:42,450
Let’s go to the analysis because we have to go a little bit faster to catch up with some cases we have.

300
00:53:43,481 --> 00:53:48,817
In the analysis what we see in the child.

301
00:53:49,096 --> 00:53:57,633
We see a child who has epileptic fits, so we have to find a remedy which has epilepsy.

302
00:53:58,225 --> 00:54:03,825
The second thing we see is the character of the child.

303
00:54:04,024 --> 00:54:10,665
The character of the child is a child which is difficult.

304
00:54:11,432 --> 00:54:21,512
Crying as the father described the child, you give her something and she throws it, you give again, she throws it...

305
00:54:22,184 --> 00:54:28,464
A child which is obstinate, a child which is crying, shouts for no reason.

306
00:54:30,127 --> 00:54:35,926
So your mind should go primarily to 2 remedies.

307
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:45,680
Which are these 2 remedies which you have to think because of this behavior of the child?

308
00:54:51,856 --> 00:55:09,999
You have to think Lyc? No, you have to think primarily of 2 remedies;

309
00:55:10,264 --> 00:55:23,438
Cina and Cham with a third possibility which is Calc-p.

310
00:55:23,791 --> 00:55:38,166
The behavior the child exhibits is a behavior between Cham., Cina and Calc-p.

311
00:55:40,238 --> 00:55:47,614
What are the differential points among them?

312
00:55:52,870 --> 00:56:00,966
– The differential among Cham., Cina and Calc-p. is the desire to be carried and the amelioration from being carried.

313
00:56:01,254 --> 00:56:12,118
But I want to say that we spent some time with Sophia and her parents at the beach for a few hours and the picture was quite different.

314
00:56:12,350 --> 00:56:15,981
She did not cry at all for 2 hours that we were together.

315
00:56:16,222 --> 00:56:22,381
She was very affectionate, she was making eye contact, she was coming to me even though she didn’t know me

316
00:56:22,701 --> 00:56:29,310
and was very nice and fondling and laughing in a very good mood.

317
00:56:29,589 --> 00:56:34,996
It was a different picture that what we saw here on the video.

318
00:56:40,973 --> 00:56:45,965
– Don’t make the mistake.

319
00:56:46,205 --> 00:57:03,413
Usually when a case is taken from the class somebody has a roommate that means somebody is also observing and also brings some feedback.

320
00:57:05,157 --> 00:57:16,324
And the patient says one thing and then she comes and says, in a particular case I am talking really,

321
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:26,971
she behaved like this according to me, this is confidential information about the woman,

322
00:57:27,548 --> 00:57:37,203
she behaves like this because I saw her with a Greek man and something was going on

323
00:57:38,091 --> 00:57:47,131
and she implied most probably that they had an affair and this affair did not go very well

324
00:57:47,556 --> 00:57:52,249
and therefore she burst out crying and she had a tantrum.

325
00:57:52,578 --> 00:57:59,323
This was confidential information coming to me.

326
00:58:00,194 --> 00:58:10,594
I asked her roommate, I said this information comes to me, what do you think? She said it is nonsense.

327
00:58:11,970 --> 00:58:20,897
She was 10 minutes with this man in a coffee shop, they were talking and then she came to the room and we were together all the time.

328
00:58:21,282 --> 00:58:32,041
But the imagination of the other woman who saw them for 2 minutes, presented a whole picture which had nothing to do with reality.

329
00:58:32,273 --> 00:58:43,908
So, you have to be careful about your momentary contact with the patient and how he deals.

330
00:58:44,117 --> 00:58:54,009
We ask the parents to describe in general the behavior so the parents they gave us the description

331
00:58:54,302 --> 00:59:01,681
and that is the description which by the way fits with what we see.

332
00:59:02,053 --> 00:59:14,126
Therefore we cannot say the child is very nice because the parents describe the child as such.

333
00:59:14,538 --> 00:59:18,595
This is very simple logic that you have to follow.

334
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:27,912
And sometimes of course it happens that the child sat down there quite exhausted,

335
00:59:28,487 --> 00:59:39,918
the parent explained this is unusual to see the child so calm, usually is much more restless because she has not slept.

336
00:59:40,899 --> 00:59:48,985
You take your observation because you were together for 2 hours.

337
00:59:49,471 --> 00:59:54,922
You cannot rely on this observation prescribing a remedy.

338
01:00:01,192 --> 01:00:14,811
We need a remedy that has in its pathology the possibility of giving out epileptic fits,

339
01:00:15,012 --> 01:00:26,153
convulsions which is a remedy which is quite difficult in their characters.

340
01:00:31,053 --> 01:00:39,567
Show me the repertorization and see how many symptoms you have used.

341
01:00:41,731 --> 01:00:58,033
You see the 2 remedies which are prominent immediately come to the mind are Cham. and Cina because Cina grinds her teeth .

342
01:00:58,893 --> 01:01:05,139
Cina is obstinate, is difficult in her character, contradictory.

343
01:01:05,527 --> 01:01:09,093
She wants something and then she throws it out.

344
01:01:09,294 --> 01:01:21,634
All this description is like Cina but let us see how many symptoms Cina has altogether.

345
01:01:24,137 --> 01:01:28,374
– 23 out of 34.

346
01:01:32,125 --> 01:01:39,762
– Cina covers 23 of the symptoms that he has put. I did not tell him to put.

347
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:44,990
As you know whoever sits next to me has to put whatever he likes.

348
01:01:46,107 --> 01:01:53,285
I correct a little bit. Is it true?

349
01:01:55,106 --> 01:01:59,269
- Did I tell you any of the symptoms to put in?
- No.

350
01:01:59,585 --> 01:02:04,667
– I corrected perhaps only one symptom.
– Changed degree.

351
01:02:04,983 --> 01:02:14,299
– Changed degree of one symptom. So whoever does the repertorization the effect should be this.

352
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:33,296
Not me. The facts. So let me see which remedies cover. Explain. Cina. Desire to be carried;

353
01:02:33,553 --> 01:02:39,775
you know that to be a characteristic of Cham.

354
01:02:40,036 --> 01:02:49,870
Do you know this to be a characteristic of Calc-p.? No. Calc-p. does not matter what you do.

355
01:02:52,422 --> 01:03:19,447
She will continue. Ant-c. also. The other is different, Cina. Contrary. Obstinate, headstrong. Restlessness.

356
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:40,793
Very restless, Cina. Shrieking. Startled from fright. Striking.

357
01:03:41,999 --> 01:03:51,260
You remember the father says she strikes, she pinches, she hits. This is characteristic.

358
01:03:51,551 --> 01:04:35,151
You can put this in the third degree. Bell., Cina., Hyos. and Nux-v. Cina comes within the most aggressive remedies.

359
01:04:37,437 --> 01:04:45,044
The child exhibits the aggressiveness, this attack.

360
01:04:49,101 --> 01:05:06,452
Show me again the Cina, explain Cina. Striking, rolling...

361
01:05:17,301 --> 01:05:31,082
Strabismus convergent with right turned in. The right eye turned in. Teeth grinding.

362
01:05:34,930 --> 01:05:49,561
And teeth grinding during sleep. Stomach hiccough. Constipation... is not now.

363
01:05:51,142 --> 01:06:05,884
Take it out. You had to have a piece of paper for those who did not have the computer and do this by hand.

364
01:06:06,346 --> 01:06:13,313
It is not possible that you understand so well the remedies that you immediately perceive.

365
01:06:13,575 --> 01:06:27,490
It’s even difficult for myself. And I completed 40 years in Homeopathy day and night.

366
01:06:28,008 --> 01:06:42,120
20 hours a day and night, Homeopathy. Still I cannot be sure between Cham. or Cina. How can you?

367
01:06:42,379 --> 01:06:54,264
You have to open the Repertory to find it. Dentition, grinding.

368
01:06:55,632 --> 01:07:00,916
Respiration difficult, night, midnight, after 1h. She said that?

369
01:07:03,702 --> 01:07:14,970
Respiration difficult in the night? – Between 1-4 a.m.

370
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:28,466
– Sometimes she has real difficulties in breathing.

371
01:07:29,051 --> 01:07:31,213
– It’s still now?

372
01:07:31,587 --> 01:07:37,337
– Yes, I thought it was because of her tonsils were greater, the adenoids,

373
01:07:37,687 --> 01:07:46,007
glands were dilated and sometimes she has difficulty in breathing. And I thought maybe it was the reason.

374
01:07:46,533 --> 01:07:51,546
– Did you operate?
– No. We were waiting to see you.

375
01:07:52,227 --> 01:08:05,107
– But if it was because of the tonsils the difficulty in breathing would be constant it wouldn’t be within a particular hour in the night.

376
01:08:05,772 --> 01:08:08,616
So therefore, we can leave it.

377
01:08:09,184 --> 01:08:19,958
Respiration wheezing, waking midnight after 4, generals night midnight, generals convulsions.

378
01:08:22,945 --> 01:08:31,445
Convulsions on the left side of the body. Cina has convulsions on the left side of the body.

379
01:08:34,974 --> 01:08:42,633
Also has convulsions from left to right. Convulsions in the night.

380
01:08:52,646 --> 01:08:58,575
Lime, slate pencils, earth, chalk, clay desire.

381
01:09:00,147 --> 01:09:10,672
Cina therefore covers the most – if not all- the symptoms of that child.

382
01:09:12,422 --> 01:09:18,439
So the remedy with which we should start this case is Cina.

383
01:09:18,797 --> 01:09:30,326
Now what is going to happen after Cina and how we shall handle it and how much we shall repeat

384
01:09:30,568 --> 01:09:38,547
and whether we will be able to ameliorate that child while taking the antiepileptic drugs

385
01:09:38,734 --> 01:09:51,620
it is a question mark which we will discuss in the general theory lessons where I’ll give you an overview of how to handle such cases.

386
01:09:52,019 --> 01:10:02,063
Because it is not only epileptic cases, it’s asthma cases, a lot of other cases which we have to talk in detail.

387
01:10:02,915 --> 01:10:13,017
For the time being in order to start treatment for this child, Cina is the best remedy.

388
01:10:13,180 --> 01:10:23,953
Also I have to say that if the antiepileptic drugs were taken out

389
01:10:24,658 --> 01:10:35,021
we would see another picture and the other picture would be much worse than what we observe here.

390
01:10:35,287 --> 01:10:41,518
Sitting and being quite... there is no being quite.

391
01:10:42,067 --> 01:10:54,074
There is a tremendous pathological activity in the brain, generalized which will make you terrified,

392
01:10:54,357 --> 01:10:58,293
you would see a terrifying picture really.

393
01:10:58,593 --> 01:11:08,316
The real picture is terrifying and the aggression may be much bigger than what you see now.

394
01:11:09,132 --> 01:11:15,833
You see the aggression and the convulsions under sedation.

395
01:11:17,251 --> 01:11:28,172
The whole child is sedated. So we don’t see the real picture and that is a problem.

396
01:11:28,568 --> 01:11:39,827
Now definitely Cina is not going to be the remedy which is going to finish or cure the case.

397
01:11:40,946 --> 01:11:45,799
The child will eventually need other remedies.

398
01:11:46,034 --> 01:11:52,748
And the other remedies we cannot at this moment see what might be.

399
01:11:53,487 --> 01:11:57,715
Even Ign. which was coming can be a possibility.

400
01:11:58,243 --> 01:12:08,643
Tub. definitely will come a time when it will be indicated and then you will see the real effect from it.

401
01:12:09,001 --> 01:12:18,593
Calc. also may be of the remedies, or Calc-p. one of the remedies that will be needed later on.

402
01:12:19,193 --> 01:12:28,661
But definitely the right remedy will start ameliorating the case to what extent... I don’t know.

403
01:12:35,314 --> 01:12:37,786
– What do you think about the vaccination?

404
01:12:38,289 --> 01:12:48,278
If I remember well it was after the vaccination of polio, not the convulsion but the cramps began.

405
01:12:48,737 --> 01:12:56,905
And if you think that the cramps are lower level of convulsion, you can think there is a development in this way.

406
01:12:57,277 --> 01:13:01,756
So there are some special nosodes of polio.

407
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:14,775
– That is true. He said that the whole thing actually started after vaccination.

408
01:13:15,082 --> 01:13:25,688
The vaccination affected this child very much negatively and started the left sided cramps.

409
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:31,432
But the child started convulsion at the age of 3.

410
01:13:31,812 --> 01:13:45,600
So there was an effect of the vaccination pointing to the danger this child was running if went under severe stress.

411
01:13:46,257 --> 01:13:48,477
What was the severe stress?

412
01:13:48,768 --> 01:14:00,822
She took antibiotics and then eventually Homeopathy and then developed this kind of convulsions.

413
01:14:01,173 --> 01:14:15,794
Definitely there was a predisposition in the child and the predisposition manifested itself immediately after the first polio vaccination.

414
01:14:20,881 --> 01:14:28,049
The idea he was discussing is it possible that we use Polio 200C.

415
01:14:28,551 --> 01:14:42,843
This you do only in cases you are totally lost because you have given all the best indicated remedies and you had no effect.

416
01:14:43,093 --> 01:14:52,185
In such case only you are justified to take the causative factor, as we call it.

417
01:14:53,043 --> 01:15:00,780
Give Polio in post-traumatic epilepsy.

418
01:15:03,751 --> 01:15:10,429
For instance, in a post-traumatic epilepsy if you have a picture of Sulph. you give it.

419
01:15:10,688 --> 01:15:17,354
But if Sulph. which seems to be indicated does not act and then the next best remedy is Apis and you give it

420
01:15:17,644 --> 01:15:30,498
and does not act and the next best is Nat-m. and does not act, then you are entitled to give Arn. as a causative factor.

421
01:15:30,829 --> 01:15:39,822
But many times you will give Arn. in the beginning and in post-traumatic epilepsy and nothing will happen.

422
01:15:42,633 --> 01:15:52,070
That means he needs Sulph. Not always Sulph.

423
01:15:53,423 --> 01:15:58,519
– How many steps you have to take before coming to this point of giving the...

424
01:16:03,449 --> 01:16:07,161
- The Tub.?
– Yes or Arn.

425
01:16:10,508 --> 01:16:13,586
– As long as you have a picture of a remedy.

426
01:16:13,958 --> 01:16:20,358
Here we have the picture of Cina but we have of a picture of Cham.

427
01:16:20,641 --> 01:16:28,112
In case Cina does not have any effect then we have to try Cham.

428
01:16:33,094 --> 01:16:45,018
And if there are some changes or new symptoms we take into consideration we may see that the child needs again Nat-m. or Ign.

429
01:16:50,835 --> 01:16:53,679
– I just wanted to ask about the curability of this case.

430
01:16:54,497 --> 01:17:14,304
- What is your prognosis?
- The prognosis is not good because we don’t know the depth of the problem at this moment.

431
01:17:16,914 --> 01:17:30,182
I don’t want to say outright this is an incurable case but I will say most probably is an incurable case.

432
01:17:30,539 --> 01:17:46,248
In any case if we manage to stop the epileptic fir the child will never become normal in her behavior and in her mind.

433
01:17:46,597 --> 01:18:02,490
She will be lacking always, she will be behind always, but as long as she can exist without chemical drugs this is a tremendous improvement.

434
01:18:03,365 --> 01:18:16,807
If you can take this child out of these drugs, because this child is convicted under this regime to live the rest of her life,

435
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:23,998
how long she is going to live, in a very difficult condition.

436
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:31,061
With Homeopathy maybe we have a possibility to improve this condition.

437
01:18:31,355 --> 01:18:39,626
To what extent... I don’t know. What I foresee is not a good prognosis.

438
01:18:46,666 --> 01:18:50,095
– You spoke of the danger of giving Tub. too early

439
01:18:50,368 --> 01:18:55,837
and I don’t know if anybody has repertorized the number of times Tub. appears in the case.

440
01:18:56,070 --> 01:19:02,990
But some of the teachers say until you give the deep-acting, chronic like Tub. nosode you won’t clear the case.

441
01:19:03,421 --> 01:19:04,885
– This is a problem.

442
01:19:05,267 --> 01:19:09,156
– You have to find the right moment. But how do you know the right moment sometimes?

443
01:19:09,512 --> 01:19:18,820
– How do you know the right teacher also?
– I am asking the right teacher!

444
01:19:19,468 --> 01:19:25,304
– That’s why you are a member of the parliament!

445
01:19:32,203 --> 01:19:41,373
The problem is that each one who pretends to be a teacher including me,

446
01:19:42,005 --> 01:19:52,180
because we pretend to be teachers, we call it “åëÝù Èåïý” in Greek.

447
01:19:52,602 --> 01:20:00,241
There is an expression that means I am a teacher because God had told me to be a teacher.

448
01:20:00,890 --> 01:20:04,640
This way anyone can be a teacher.

449
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:11,713
The problem is that these people have small experience and in their little experience they found out

450
01:20:12,133 --> 01:20:21,427
that when they gave Sulph. or Calc. and did not act and they gave a dose of Tub. the case was solved or opened.

451
01:20:21,806 --> 01:20:25,784
But this cannot be generalized.

452
01:20:25,970 --> 01:20:38,601
Once they see one or two cases like this, they come and say unless you give the deeper remedy... this is totally wrong.

453
01:20:38,819 --> 01:20:45,513
What they thought to be the deeper remedy was the uppermost layer.

454
01:20:48,934 --> 01:21:02,202
Unless you go layer by layer you can never benefit the case because all the cases today as I said have different layers.

455
01:21:02,437 --> 01:21:11,729
This is a symptomatology of Tub. and under Tub. there is a symptomatology of Sulph.

456
01:21:14,329 --> 01:21:20,317
and under Sulph. there is a symptomatology of Nat-m.

457
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:33,709
Because Sulhp. brings up a symptom to the surface which is desire sweets

458
01:21:34,858 --> 01:21:44,019
and another symptom which is vertigo high places together with a few other of these symptoms, they think this is a Sulph. case.

459
01:21:44,370 --> 01:21:47,520
They give Sulph. nothing happens.

460
01:21:47,908 --> 01:21:57,232
Then, they see also the desire of salt, they give Nat-m. because desire for salt is popping up in the original case.

461
01:21:58,634 --> 01:22:07,561
And they ignore the essential features of Tub. which were there.

462
01:22:07,822 --> 01:22:13,768
Eventually they give it and they say now, unless you give the deeper remedy...

463
01:22:14,035 --> 01:22:16,990
But the deeper remedy is the uppermost.

464
01:22:23,141 --> 01:22:33,536
If you have here a deeper remedy, let us say Psor. is here and you have to give 3 remedies before Psor. and you give Psor.

465
01:22:37,172 --> 01:22:42,631
The most probable is the organism will not move at all. Nothing will happen.

466
01:22:42,956 --> 01:22:48,862
But if you give Sulph. which is the immediate underlying

467
01:22:49,192 --> 01:22:55,829
then the organism will move and will change the symptomatology without progressing the case.

468
01:22:56,249 --> 01:23:01,166
Will upset the case. A headache which is on the right will go to the left.

469
01:23:01,588 --> 01:23:10,976
A vertigo which is while rising from bed will be while lying in bed.

470
01:23:11,422 --> 01:23:19,961
This kind of changes and the person will report some changes which are unfortunate.

471
01:23:21,297 --> 01:23:29,503
Because it means that the case has not progressed. It has been disturbed.

472
01:23:30,395 --> 01:23:39,735
Not because the remedy is not indicated but because it’s indicated as a second remedy, not as a first one.

473
01:23:40,505 --> 01:23:43,343
And you have to take into concideration...

474
01:23:43,712 --> 01:23:52,874
here you see the computer immediately will show the uppermost remedies are Cina and Cham.;

475
01:23:54,477 --> 01:23:56,601
there is no question about that.

476
01:23:57,240 --> 01:24:06,339
If you give Ign... You see the mother had been suffering and maybe she was Ign. or she needed Ign. why don’t give the child Ign.

477
01:24:06,744 --> 01:24:12,373
There are different theories that we hear from different teachers.

478
01:24:12,723 --> 01:24:22,986
Then, you upset the case again with certain changes but not really curing the case.

479
01:24:24,655 --> 01:24:30,594
The problem with Homeopathy is that it is difficult in each application.

480
01:24:31,007 --> 01:24:41,840
But if you see the end results, they are phenomenal, they are unbelievable if you do it properly.

481
01:24:42,157 --> 01:24:53,717
If you do it haphazardly, superficially then you will be in a state of Calc-p. all the time.

482
01:24:55,813 --> 01:25:07,019
Dissatisfaction. You saw it with the cancer case.

483
01:25:07,805 --> 01:25:16,214
You saw the improvement. One remedy, second remedy, there is improvement.

484
01:25:21,068 --> 01:25:25,458
30 other remedies could have been given, no effect.

485
01:25:27,353 --> 01:25:37,990
I could even say if Calc. was given as the first remedy, most probably you would see only a disturbance.

486
01:25:38,809 --> 01:25:44,293
But giving it in the correct order then you saw the result.

487
01:25:45,006 --> 01:26:03,518
– Which potency?
– Here, in these cases you don’t go high, you go low. That’s the first rule.

488
01:26:03,874 --> 01:26:11,287
The second rule is because there are chemical drugs, you have to repeat quite frequently.

489
01:26:11,578 --> 01:26:22,798
That means, quite low, repeated 3 times a day at least for quite some time.

490
01:26:26,897 --> 01:26:37,008
And the problem will be how to reduce and when to start reducing the allopathic drug.

491
01:26:38,353 --> 01:26:44,250
You have to start with Cina 30C, 3 times a day.

492
01:26:44,779 --> 01:26:54,263
I will not go to 12C here because I need a little more strength to overcome the drugs which are very powerful.

493
01:26:57,180 --> 01:27:08,578
And after observation of 20 days the parents they realize the child is getting quieter

494
01:27:11,081 --> 01:27:18,324
and some indications are there that the remedy is acting curatively.

495
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:26,448
They have to start reducing the antiepileptic medication by a fraction every day.

496
01:27:26,635 --> 01:27:29,592
By a very small fraction.

497
01:27:29,780 --> 01:27:36,511
I don’t know how you can do it technically, but he is a medical doctor, the father, he most probably will find a way to do it.

498
01:27:39,815 --> 01:27:48,274
You continue to give the remedy and if possible after...

499
01:27:54,132 --> 01:28:09,873
What it may happen is that in the process may reduce the chemical drug as it gets better and better.

500
01:28:10,699 --> 01:28:22,152
If at the certain moment they will notice a kind of a relapse they have to change the potency a little bit;

501
01:28:23,102 --> 01:28:35,269
like instead of 30C they have to go to 31C, 32C, 33C and as they reduce they raise the potency

502
01:28:35,918 --> 01:28:40,048
and the moment that the child is kept

503
01:28:40,333 --> 01:28:50,969
and the child at a certain moment when the reduction will be quite substantial will have some epileptic fits.

504
01:28:51,348 --> 01:29:07,544
These epileptic fits, if they can be controlled by the extra remedy which they use in the nose that will be very encouraging.

505
01:29:07,852 --> 01:29:14,550
Because not every day again the organism will take the chemical drug.

506
01:29:14,827 --> 01:29:32,510
In this way they can continue reducing the chemicals and raising the potency of the remedy.

507
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:42,628
There is going to be a time where most probably will have a change in symptomatology.

508
01:29:43,584 --> 01:29:57,235
They have to take care in every change that the child will have to see whether this change will fit with another remedy.

509
01:30:01,528 --> 01:30:05,894
And what will be the next remedy.

510
01:30:08,316 --> 01:30:16,953
It’s a case, unfortunately, that needs somebody quite experienced to take care of and to advise.

511
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:38,638
Because you can imagine the moment he will take out the drug she will go into status and then the damage will be permanent.

512
01:30:41,434 --> 01:30:52,442
Here we have the problem that we have the whole hemisphere is distorted and affected;

513
01:30:52,872 --> 01:31:05,592
it is not just focal epilepsy. We have epilepsy because of the whole hemisphere being damaged.

514
01:31:06,554 --> 01:31:11,367
And we have to build that hemisphere slowly again.

515
01:31:14,576 --> 01:31:23,227
It is not an easy job. We attempt to do something next to a miracle.

516
01:31:25,446 --> 01:31:31,968
and then we have to do it very carefully so we don’t damage.

517
01:31:40,539 --> 01:31:45,482
- Will be Cina modifying the severity of the case?

518
01:31:48,405 --> 01:31:58,938
– Cina, if it is the correct remedy, will reduce the aggression of the fits.

519
01:31:59,482 --> 01:32:03,426
And will reduce the aggression of the child.

520
01:32:03,668 --> 01:32:15,376
So the child herself will be less aggressive, less disturbed internally and will have...

521
01:32:18,315 --> 01:32:26,880
I don’t know if it’s less severe or less in number as well, maybe both.

522
01:32:34,706 --> 01:32:37,476
– Would you think of plusing the remedy?

523
01:32:40,771 --> 01:32:44,483
Giving perhaps a liquid and succussing it each time before you give a dose

524
01:32:44,849 --> 01:32:48,428
rather than just keep giving the bottle with the same potency?

525
01:32:48,713 --> 01:32:51,226
– This you can also do it.

526
01:32:51,666 --> 01:33:01,384
But I would increase the potency the moment I see this potency does not hold any more.

527
01:33:01,619 --> 01:33:09,502
So that I have the possibility to increase the potency and then change the vibration 1, 2 or 3 degrees even.

528
01:33:09,923 --> 01:33:21,647
You understand this? You just increase in case during the reduction of the antiepileptic

529
01:33:21,888 --> 01:33:31,411
you will see more fits coming and then you will have to raise the potency.

530
01:33:35,868 --> 01:33:44,332
– When the fits do return, why wouldn’t you use an homeopathic remedy for that acute?

531
01:33:45,603 --> 01:33:50,899
– Yes, if they give me enough information.

532
01:33:51,235 --> 01:34:03,484
If the fits give me information that I know now the fit is like Buffo, or Artem. or whatever.

533
01:34:15,515 --> 01:34:24,026
Unfortunately here, in this school you will not see an easy case.

534
01:34:24,474 --> 01:34:29,242
The cases we will see here are all very difficult cases,

535
01:34:29,586 --> 01:34:36,551
attempted to be treated by both Homeopathy and Allopathy and end up coming here.

536
01:34:36,895 --> 01:34:40,744
And you hear these people are coming from Portugal,

537
01:34:41,094 --> 01:34:48,966
sometimes people are coming from Canada or even Australia, which is even further.

538
01:34:49,255 --> 01:34:55,521
So if they do come that means there is nothing else left as a hope.
