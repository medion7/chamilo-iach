1
00:00:17,933 --> 00:00:25,103
You come from Israel, you have been born in Israel and what is the problem?

2
00:00:25,346 --> 00:00:28,424
– There are 2 problems that I am coming for.

3
00:00:28,668 --> 00:00:40,706
First is that since I was a child I was a constant desire to die which is very much increased this last year.

4
00:00:45,093 --> 00:00:53,548
– You say this laughingly!
– I try not to feel it.

5
00:00:53,817 --> 00:00:59,702
– But if you feel it, you still laugh?
– No, I’m crying.

6
00:00:59,948 --> 00:01:05,105
– And when you feel it is it painful?
– Very painful.

7
00:01:05,377 --> 00:01:07,745
– You took Aur.?
–No.

8
00:01:07,994 --> 00:01:12,207
– You didn’t take any remedies?
– I took a lot of remedies.

9
00:01:12,476 --> 00:01:15,172
– What remedies have you taken?

10
00:01:15,426 --> 00:01:27,908
– I’ve taken Phos., Nux-v., Plat., Lach. and Anac. and Nat-c. and Mag-c.

11
00:01:28,072 --> 00:01:42,917
and Carc., Lyc., Puls., Naja., Ph-ac. and Caust.

12
00:01:44,348 --> 00:01:52,292
– You have a good memory!
– No, I wrote it down.

13
00:01:54,846 --> 00:01:59,385
– It’s impressive how well you remember!

14
00:02:02,468 --> 00:02:07,909
– So, you say since childhood. Do you know why?

15
00:02:08,184 --> 00:02:11,924
Was there a reason, you were living in kibbutz?

16
00:02:12,024 --> 00:02:15,094
– This is a good reason, but not mine!

17
00:02:15,348 --> 00:02:20,708
I think it’s because I wasn’t very happy at home.

18
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:28,627
– Due to your problems or due to the problems in the family?

19
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:34,265
– In the family. I was a very happy child with a very miserable childhood.

20
00:02:35,545 --> 00:02:43,987
My father died of cancer when I was 7,5. And he died after very great suffering.

21
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:49,872
And my mother who was even before a very tough woman became even tougher.

22
00:02:50,148 --> 00:02:55,346
She beat us very much.
– You have another sister?

23
00:02:55,587 --> 00:02:59,427
– Yes, I have. A younger brother and a younger sister.

24
00:02:59,702 --> 00:03:05,067
– And she was beating you more than the others?
– Less. I was the beloved child.

25
00:03:12,226 --> 00:03:21,976
– Your depression started immediately after your father’s death

26
00:03:22,225 --> 00:03:26,586
or has it no connection with your father death?

27
00:03:26,827 --> 00:03:29,146
– I don’t know but if you wanted me to tell

28
00:03:29,387 --> 00:03:40,667
what is my first memory is the memory has my mother is telling me that my father is dying.

29
00:03:49,545 --> 00:03:52,362
– She was very abrupt.

30
00:03:52,972 --> 00:04:06,732
– Yes, very violent and aggressive with no sympathy at all.

31
00:04:08,507 --> 00:04:12,622
– No sympathy for you or for your father?

32
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:23,265
– Both. I was alone at home and she came and I was very happy that day

33
00:04:23,545 --> 00:04:30,455
because I had a very great mark in a test that none got such a mark and I went to her

34
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:39,415
and said mum see I got 100, none got 100 and she said your father died and you deal with marks, go away!

35
00:04:39,664 --> 00:04:45,815
I don’t want to see you, you creep! And I didn’t cry.

36
00:04:49,655 --> 00:04:58,346
I was just amazed. Oh, that happened!

37
00:04:58,864 --> 00:05:02,690
– And later on did you cry?
– Yes.

38
00:05:02,944 --> 00:05:06,266
– Because of that event or for another reasons?

39
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:10,868
– Because of that event when I am telling it to close people.

40
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,464
But because of other events but not in front of her.

41
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:17,786
Never in front of her. I never show her that I’m weak.

42
00:05:18,033 --> 00:05:24,450
When she left me to sleep outside the house because she was angry I didn’t even say anything.

43
00:05:24,704 --> 00:05:30,068
I went and slept outside.

44
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:36,224
My younger brother and sister used to cry and shout and say mummy, mummy and she took them back.

45
00:05:36,468 --> 00:05:39,988
But I never.
– You are very proud.

46
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:47,170
– My father told the story that when I was less than 3 he punished me.

47
00:05:47,424 --> 00:05:55,104
He was a very gentle man and he said you go to the toilet and you think about what you did

48
00:05:55,348 --> 00:06:00,224
because you did something very wrong, you sit there and then I’ll come to call you

49
00:06:00,468 --> 00:06:05,860
but because he was gentle he left the door open and he sat very close that I could see him.

50
00:06:06,106 --> 00:06:12,770
And even though after one moment he couldn’t stand it and he came and said come out and I said no.

51
00:06:13,024 --> 00:06:21,220
You said sit , I will sit. And I sat there 4 hours. Stubborn.

52
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:34,784
– Do you have problem with the thyroid? Can you swallow?

53
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:36,386
– When I was 12 they thought I had

54
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:41,265
because it was bigger and they checked it and said it’s on the border.

55
00:06:41,506 --> 00:06:49,466
But when I was pregnant I was regularly checked and it is ok.

56
00:06:51,788 --> 00:07:01,268
But this began when I was 10, I think it was because I grew up very fast.

57
00:07:09,452 --> 00:07:18,263
This last year it became much stronger because I had a baby,

58
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:30,298
she is 11,5 months old and her beginning was very difficult for her and for me also.

59
00:07:30,788 --> 00:07:34,903
And since then I have a terrible anxiety.

60
00:07:35,144 --> 00:07:39,268
I feel that I cannot reach her, I am not good enough to do that,

61
00:07:39,535 --> 00:07:42,095
I don’t know how to do the right thing.

62
00:07:42,346 --> 00:07:48,985
And it doesn’t leave me even for one moment the anxiety about her.

63
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:54,380
And I don’t sleep, I feel I don’t sleep even one night.

64
00:07:54,628 --> 00:08:02,575
My mind is always thinking. It began in the first months always about her.

65
00:08:02,826 --> 00:08:06,415
What to do if she cried, if she feels wrong.

66
00:08:06,666 --> 00:08:11,535
Now it’s not only about her but I am thinking all the time, I can’t stop thinking.

67
00:08:11,786 --> 00:08:17,668
Even when I am sleeping and I am dreaming it’s not really a dream it’s like thoughts.

68
00:08:18,186 --> 00:08:26,380
So I have no rest. All things are getting worse and worse.

69
00:08:26,628 --> 00:08:31,225
– Do you have enough energy to go along?

70
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:36,868
– I have a lot of energy. I do everything at home and I work. I go to bed.

71
00:08:38,148 --> 00:08:49,935
– But you cannot sleep?
– I sleep but I sleep bad. I’m thinking during sleep.

72
00:08:50,186 --> 00:08:54,499
– If there is a little noise will you wake up?
– Yes, immediately.

73
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:58,732
I’m hearing when she is turning from one side to other

74
00:08:58,832 --> 00:09:01,987
and I wake up and I see what happens with her.

75
00:09:02,226 --> 00:09:08,544
So my husband sent me to sleep in my clinic jus to have some sleep!

76
00:09:08,816 --> 00:09:10,347
I go upstairs and sleep there.

77
00:09:10,586 --> 00:09:17,261
And it’s a little bit better but I am still with my ear all the time.

78
00:09:17,504 --> 00:09:24,770
So I’m really very tired.
– That is one problem. The other problem?

79
00:09:25,024 --> 00:09:33,466
– The anxiety which I never had before. I was not an anxious person at all.

80
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:40,260
– When was it started?
– When the baby was born. She screamed all the first months.

81
00:09:40,506 --> 00:09:42,548
– After your labor?
– Yes.

82
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:48,186
– You labor was natural or were you given some medication?

83
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:57,665
– Just painkiller, Epidural. That’s how we call it in Israel.

84
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:01,744
– Is it a painkiller or hormones?

85
00:10:02,021 --> 00:10:08,107
– No, I didn’t need it. It was very speedy and painful.

86
00:10:09,905 --> 00:10:13,986
I asked for it. I couldn’t stand it.

87
00:10:14,266 --> 00:10:19,386
I had a contraction one after another from the beginning,

88
00:10:19,627 --> 00:10:24,782
it was very passionate. Like a storm!

89
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:29,626
– You have one child?
– Yes this is my first baby.

90
00:10:31,096 --> 00:10:41,102
– And your husband is supportive?
– Very supportive.

91
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:49,986
– Are you a homeopathic practitioner?
– Just a beginner.

92
00:10:51,533 --> 00:10:56,386
– You are living away from your mother now?
– No. Very close.

93
00:10:56,653 --> 00:11:00,988
– But not in the same house?
– No! I left house when I was 18

94
00:11:01,263 --> 00:11:06,283
and lived very far away and then I felt stronger to be close to her

95
00:11:06,383 --> 00:11:10,466
and she is very good with my baby and I want my baby have a grandmother

96
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:17,217
and so I am dealing with it, it’s very difficult, she is still very violent.

97
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:21,057
– Have you ever been violent in your reactions towards her?

98
00:11:21,572 --> 00:11:37,788
– Never even not in talking. I wanted to, very much, but never.

99
00:11:38,063 --> 00:11:49,857
My brother and sister they beat her when she beat my sister when she was 17 she beat her back.

100
00:11:50,108 --> 00:11:58,052
I didn’t do that.
- But you would like to do it?

101
00:11:58,306 --> 00:12:02,532
– Yes very much! She deserves it!

102
00:12:03,548 --> 00:12:16,348
– But have you ever expressed your anger verbally or in action to other people?

103
00:12:16,866 --> 00:12:19,937
– Just with my husband.

104
00:12:20,452 --> 00:12:26,588
– What are you tending to do, are you violent with him,

105
00:12:26,852 --> 00:12:32,465
you are just verbally violent or you want to take something and throw it to him?

106
00:12:32,737 --> 00:12:35,025
– No I never wanted to throw something

107
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:40,145
because I can talk so the anger doesn’t grow inside me I can say you did this,

108
00:12:40,668 --> 00:12:50,385
it’s not ok and I feel terrible, I can even shout so the anger is going out but it’s only with him.

109
00:12:50,908 --> 00:13:01,412
With other people I just go I don’t want to be near that.

110
00:13:04,988 --> 00:13:12,227
– Are you sure you did not take Nat-m.?
– Never.

111
00:13:12,227 --> 00:13:15,308
– Ign.?
– Never.

112
00:13:17,347 --> 00:13:26,828
– Are you sure these remedies are the only ones or you can’t remember?

113
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:34,777
– It has been 13 years since the first remedy which was not for this at all.

114
00:13:35,026 --> 00:13:42,457
– Not for the anxiety?
– No, never. Just the last ones the Lyc.

115
00:13:42,706 --> 00:13:49,302
and the Caust. were for the anxiety.

116
00:13:49,548 --> 00:13:56,707
– And the anxiety is for a specific reason? Anxiety about the future?

117
00:13:56,982 --> 00:14:06,188
Financial anxiety? About the health of the husband? Health of the daughter? Or is it anxiety which has no reason.

118
00:14:06,457 --> 00:14:11,062
– There is a baby and I have to take care of her and I cannot.

119
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:14,902
This is my feeling. So she’s helpless.

120
00:14:15,148 --> 00:14:21,027
This is my feeling I have to be very anxious about what happens with her

121
00:14:21,302 --> 00:14:27,157
because I feel like I don’t have the natural instinct how to take care of her.

122
00:14:28,707 --> 00:14:34,063
– You feel all the time you may make a mistake and this mistake can be fatal?

123
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:44,867
– Yes, exactly because at the beginning she suffered a lot and it is my fault.

124
00:14:47,945 --> 00:14:53,584
– Why?
– Because she couldn’t nurse and didn’t want to take a bottle

125
00:14:53,827 --> 00:14:58,704
and she was hungry and she screamed 24 hours a day.

126
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,147
– And you did not know what to do?

127
00:15:04,419 --> 00:15:14,660
- I knew what to do, I put her in a sack and I jumped all the time for 3 months.

128
00:15:14,906 --> 00:15:20,544
That relaxed her. After 5 weeks she started to eat from the bottle

129
00:15:20,788 --> 00:15:26,180
and it took it another 3 months and then she became better.

130
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:31,810
It isn’t the right thing to do, jump with the baby, she has to be better

131
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:35,650
but I took her to a homeopath and to doctors and none could help her.

132
00:15:35,904 --> 00:15:40,506
That was what I had to do.

133
00:15:42,304 --> 00:15:48,704
– About your other activities are you confident?

134
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:56,384
That means the only lack of self-confidence is towards the child or for other matters as well?

135
00:15:56,628 --> 00:16:07,124
– The opposite. I am very sure. Even too much. I am sure that I am right!

136
00:16:11,244 --> 00:16:23,546
– Now this feeling or thoughts that you would like to die, what prevents you from doing that?

137
00:16:24,064 --> 00:16:30,121
You think about the child, the pain that you are going to cause?

138
00:16:30,221 --> 00:16:42,935
– Yes pain to my husband and my daughter. It’s my duty to take care of both of them.

139
00:16:43,425 --> 00:16:49,335
I cannot leave them with that pain, it’s a terrible thing to do.

140
00:16:49,584 --> 00:16:55,466
– But inside of you there is a kind of constant battle;

141
00:16:55,735 --> 00:17:04,695
I want to die but I must not. Is this a constant thing?

142
00:17:04,944 --> 00:17:10,305
– It’s not a constant thing because the desire to die is not all the time; it comes in attacks.

143
00:17:10,585 --> 00:17:14,980
– Have you ever thought of how you would do it?

144
00:17:15,226 --> 00:17:22,906
– I want to shoot myself. I have a constant desire just to do it and finish all this nonsense.

145
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:26,746
– Do you take afternoon sleep?

146
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:34,644
– Never, cannot, even if I am very tired because I am active.

147
00:17:34,744 --> 00:17:44,487
I want to do things. So I can rest some time if I am very tired but never afternoon sleep.

148
00:17:44,587 --> 00:18:28,026
Some physical problems; my nails and eczema here. Also this one.

149
00:18:34,944 --> 00:19:00,301
And eczema here and here. Usually I have problems with my skin.

150
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,866
They come and go without anything.

151
00:19:04,384 --> 00:19:10,548
In this I put some cortisone ointment when I couldn’t even move my hands and I couldn’t do anything.

152
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:17,730
It was very bad. Oozing and bleeding and I couldn’t even move.

153
00:19:17,984 --> 00:19:23,866
But usually I put nothing and the skin problems are coming and going.

154
00:19:25,908 --> 00:19:29,467
– Your menses are normal?
– No.

155
00:19:29,742 --> 00:19:33,068
– Before menses you are more anxious?
– Yes.

156
00:19:33,582 --> 00:19:41,505
These days between ovulation and menses all the things are getting worse till the menses comes.

157
00:19:41,772 --> 00:19:57,388
I am getting very depressed and anxious and I eat quite a lot this year.

158
00:19:57,627 --> 00:20:01,985
Eating all the time. It’s not an appetite.

159
00:20:02,252 --> 00:20:08,908
I just have to do something with my mouth. I don’t care what it is, whatever.

160
00:20:09,147 --> 00:20:14,685
I don’t feel hunger at all. I just have to chew something.

161
00:20:14,785 --> 00:20:19,664
I also thought of starting smoking because I want to do something with my mouth.

162
00:20:19,941 --> 00:20:25,307
I didn’t want to do that because I hate cigarettes but I thought about it.

163
00:20:25,571 --> 00:20:34,105
Because chewing gum is not very polite so I cannot do it all the time. So, I am eating.

164
00:20:36,581 --> 00:20:46,285
– Do you like something to eat? Sweets?

165
00:20:46,385 --> 00:20:50,572
– Usually I don’t eat sweets at all. I don’t like sweets.

166
00:20:50,828 --> 00:20:57,562
But nowadays, this year I don’t care if it’s sweet or not. Anything.

167
00:21:01,772 --> 00:21:10,732
It’s terrible and I put on a lot of weight. Not from pregnancy; after pregnancy. 15 kilos.

168
00:21:11,502 --> 00:21:16,428
– What about thirst?
– I am thirsty.

169
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:23,852
I became thirsty from pregnancy and I drink a lot. I was not thirsty before?

170
00:21:24,108 --> 00:21:32,587
– For cold?
– If it is hot outside I want it to be very cold, if it is not I don’t care.

171
00:21:33,105 --> 00:21:40,026
– And you drink one glass of water or 2-3 glasses at the same time?

172
00:21:40,267 --> 00:21:47,947
– I drink a lot. I don’t know how many glasses though. I don’t take little water.

173
00:21:48,216 --> 00:21:53,336
– Are you an ambitious person?
– This is the big question.

174
00:21:53,585 --> 00:22:02,545
I think I am an ambitious person with no healthy ambition. This is the big problem.

175
00:22:02,786 --> 00:22:07,147
I don’t know how to define it but yes, I am ambitious person.

176
00:22:07,665 --> 00:22:15,184
– You want to be the first, the best?
– Yes. I must be!

177
00:22:18,531 --> 00:22:22,371
– Concerning your temperature...

178
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:30,544
- I am cold. As the years pass I am getting warmer but as a person I am cold.

179
00:22:30,821 --> 00:22:33,891
– And you are aggravated by cold or not?

180
00:22:34,384 --> 00:22:38,224
– I don’t think I am aggravated but I don’t like cold weather.

181
00:22:38,501 --> 00:22:46,427
If I am stepping on the floor and the weather is not very warm I cannot warm my feet.

182
00:22:46,945 --> 00:22:54,864
– Your feet are cold?
– If I am stepping on cold floor it will never be warm.

183
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:58,211
– Otherwise?
– It’s ok.

184
00:22:58,381 --> 00:23:04,016
– You don’t stick them out of covers.
– No.

185
00:23:06,827 --> 00:23:11,584
– In what position do you sleep? Any position.

186
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:18,746
And how many hours of sleep do you sleep?
– Between 6-8.

187
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:24,800
In the summer less and in the winter more. This is usually.

188
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:29,748
Now I can sleep all day.
– Do you have normal bowel normal.

189
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:37,975
– A tendency to constipation which absolutely disappeared after pregnancy.

190
00:23:38,224 --> 00:23:47,706
– What time you...
- Every morning, before breakfast.

191
00:23:47,947 --> 00:23:51,787
I have to take time for this. It’s not coming very easily.

192
00:23:52,056 --> 00:24:00,747
I have to have time to walk and to think with no interruption and then it comes.

193
00:24:01,016 --> 00:24:04,346
– The anxiety is all the time?

194
00:24:04,856 --> 00:24:08,945
– It doesn’t leave me even for one moment since she was born.

195
00:24:09,466 --> 00:24:14,586
The most terrible time is noon when she goes to sleep and I am alone with her.

196
00:24:14,827 --> 00:24:18,667
Being alone with her is very difficult for me.

197
00:24:19,185 --> 00:24:24,056
I want someone to be there if something happens.

198
00:24:24,346 --> 00:24:31,226
I sit on the sofa when she is sleeping like this and I don’t move

199
00:24:31,226 --> 00:24:39,651
because I do not want anything to happen, that she will cry or something...

200
00:25:11,984 --> 00:25:18,031
- What is the best time for you?
– Usually in the morning when I am waking up.

201
00:25:18,307 --> 00:25:21,871
Now it’s the evening when she is going to sleep and my husband is at home.

202
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:26,698
It’s not because of the time. Anytime that he is with me is ok.

203
00:25:26,967 --> 00:25:32,387
– You need only your husband or just anybody?

204
00:25:32,626 --> 00:25:40,751
– I prefer my husband but sometimes I go to my mother to be with.

205
00:25:46,186 --> 00:25:52,068
– You drink milk? You like?
– Sometimes.

206
00:25:52,335 --> 00:25:56,665
– Eggs?
– Sometimes. No fish.

207
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:07,748
Nothing from the sea and also not the sea. I hate the sea. I don’t like it.

208
00:26:08,015 --> 00:26:14,306
– The sea makes you feel bad?
– Sad. I don’t like it.

209
00:26:14,545 --> 00:26:17,628
– Do you know why? Was there an experience.

210
00:26:17,892 --> 00:26:23,505
– I don’t the smell, the look of it. I don’t like it.

211
00:26:23,777 --> 00:26:33,506
I like to be a place where are woods very very much. Not the sea.

212
00:26:34,017 --> 00:26:38,372
Here it is ok because it doesn’t smell so strong.

213
00:26:38,626 --> 00:26:43,228
In Israel it has a very strong smell and I don’t like it.

214
00:26:45,788 --> 00:26:58,588
– If you sleep in the afternoon how you wake up?
– Not good.

215
00:26:58,852 --> 00:27:01,212
– Very bad?
– Not very bad.

216
00:27:01,466 --> 00:27:06,268
– You feel like dead. – I will never wake up like this.

217
00:27:06,532 --> 00:27:17,088
I will come with a little headache and heaviness and sadness but will disappear very quickly.

218
00:27:19,666 --> 00:27:29,806
– How is your sexual desire? – Absolutely normal. Good.

219
00:27:29,907 --> 00:27:33,263
– Do you have any leucorrhea?
– Never.

220
00:27:34,024 --> 00:27:38,626
– Is there any dryness in the vagina?
– Never.

221
00:27:39,393 --> 00:27:43,907
– Salt? You take it normally?
– Normal.

222
00:27:44,182 --> 00:28:01,146
Maybe a little less than other people. Thank you very much.

223
00:28:03,216 --> 00:28:17,024
For her case we have to differentiate between several remedies. Which are these remedies?

224
00:28:17,296 --> 00:28:37,261
For her case there is a possibility for Aur., Nat-s. and Staph.

225
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:43,147
You want some more? You have another idea?

226
00:28:46,987 --> 00:28:58,507
For all 3 remedies we have quite good substantiation.

227
00:29:00,026 --> 00:29:07,745
The way that she described her depression and the battle inside,

228
00:29:08,025 --> 00:29:11,585
that she tries to resist committing suicide

229
00:29:11,865 --> 00:29:14,666
because she things about the relatives

230
00:29:14,935 --> 00:29:25,665
and the pain that will cause them is characteristic of Nat-s. That is true.

231
00:29:25,945 --> 00:29:41,025
The fact that she says she has been so much suppressing her anger leads us to the idea of Staph.

232
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:46,045
We also know that Staph. has suicidal depression

233
00:29:46,145 --> 00:29:52,976
and also prefers to shoot herself instead of jumping from a high place.

234
00:29:53,227 --> 00:30:04,747
At the same time she says I am thinking so much of suicide that our mind goes straightaway to Aur.

235
00:30:05,461 --> 00:30:18,761
and she confirms by saying that I am really an ambitious person, I am active, I do everything.

236
00:30:31,866 --> 00:30:45,946
What is the first rubric that you want to look?

237
00:30:46,187 --> 00:30:49,016
Something she clearly said.

238
00:30:49,265 --> 00:31:09,496
Suicidal depression; Aur., Nat-s., Psor., Aur-m. are the main remedies.

239
00:31:10,588 --> 00:31:26,733
The next you want to look is commit suicide by shooting;

240
00:31:26,984 --> 00:31:39,784
Staph. is there, Aur. and Nat-s. Staph. has been raised.

241
00:31:44,265 --> 00:31:50,414
Does anybody have the original Kent Repertory?

242
00:31:50,904 --> 00:32:03,984
Can you tell me if Staph. is there? Suicidal depression, shooting.

243
00:32:06,544 --> 00:32:15,747
Nat-s. and Aur. These 2 remedies.

244
00:32:28,024 --> 00:32:46,224
And then what other symptom you look? Distorted nails.

245
00:32:46,467 --> 00:33:08,745
What she is actually having in her nails is not distortion it is either a fungus

246
00:33:08,984 --> 00:33:19,224
or it can be a prodromal state of psoriasis.

247
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:28,110
– I had it when I was 17 and it was fungus then.

248
00:33:28,224 --> 00:33:40,215
– Ok. We have eruption, then we look eruption on, around or under nails...

249
00:33:59,664 --> 00:34:13,495
Smiling when speaking. Let’s see this which is quite strong.

250
00:34:13,744 --> 00:34:22,704
She will say everything with a smile. Show me this rubric. It’s interesting.

251
00:34:22,945 --> 00:34:37,815
Aur. has this suicidal depression and at the same time has this smiling while talking.

252
00:34:38,305 --> 00:34:43,300
– She laughs when she was talking seriously about suicide.

253
00:34:43,546 --> 00:34:49,706
She laughs at serious matters.
– I don’t think.

254
00:34:52,266 --> 00:34:59,586
When you have a symptoms it’s a mental symptom.

255
00:34:59,853 --> 00:35:16,585
What she has is more a kind of saying things but not smiling over serious matters.

256
00:35:17,108 --> 00:35:21,189
I will explain it to you. Show me smiling over serious matters.

257
00:35:21,464 --> 00:35:44,505
Anac., Plat., Nat-m. Nat-m. would be a nervous laugh. Plat. would be a mental case

258
00:35:44,746 --> 00:35:48,586
where she would talk seriously and then she would laugh.

259
00:35:48,843 --> 00:36:00,624
It is something that worries you to see. It’s not what she had.

260
00:36:00,865 --> 00:36:12,385
She is totally in control of what she says. Here is a function which is uncontrollable.

261
00:36:12,906 --> 00:36:20,586
– There is also a rubric laughing alternating with desire for death.

262
00:36:20,855 --> 00:36:33,386
There is only remedy.
– Which?

263
00:36:33,655 --> 00:36:37,217
– Aur.
– But she does not have that.

264
00:36:37,468 --> 00:36:41,308
That is not a symptom you can take for her

265
00:36:41,572 --> 00:36:50,686
because what it says there is a pathological condition.

266
00:36:50,786 --> 00:37:01,948
Laughing and then I want to kill myself. It is a kind of craziness.

267
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:13,224
You are so inexperienced, I can see it from your remarks, I’m sorry!

268
00:37:13,743 --> 00:37:26,817
When I first started treating people, after a few months,

269
00:37:27,068 --> 00:37:35,266
they brought me a boy who was crazy.

270
00:37:35,777 --> 00:37:45,252
They said this boy is not feeling well, can you see him? I said yes, why not.

271
00:37:45,506 --> 00:37:59,068
The boy came and I thought I could talk with him

272
00:37:59,332 --> 00:38:06,497
and he started talking and talking without me asking any other question

273
00:38:06,748 --> 00:38:20,066
and he spoke about what he had done and spoke and spoke at a moment I felt totally inadequate.

274
00:38:20,577 --> 00:38:24,145
What is this in front of me? I cannot communicate!

275
00:38:24,417 --> 00:38:30,545
There was somebody who was totally out of mind.

276
00:38:30,817 --> 00:38:35,937
He was crazy, in a state of acute insanity.

277
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:40,292
You will see in my first years I could not understand what this is.

278
00:38:40,546 --> 00:38:49,645
I got such a fright myself looking at this phenomenon in front of me that I could not communicate with!

279
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:56,587
He was just talking and the opposite can happen with a novice.

280
00:38:56,826 --> 00:39:05,786
Because you read in books and you don’t have the real experience

281
00:39:06,061 --> 00:39:10,144
you feel somebody is laughing maybe he is crazy!

282
00:39:10,416 --> 00:39:15,164
Just because he is laughing you think maybe he is crazy. No, it’s not like that.

283
00:39:15,264 --> 00:39:28,665
There are some symptoms where somebody is really crazy or half-crazy or whatever.

284
00:39:30,979 --> 00:39:35,666
I have seen this with homeopaths over and over again,

285
00:39:35,907 --> 00:39:39,706
they mistake either taking something too seriously

286
00:39:39,947 --> 00:39:46,865
or somebody has cancer and they treat it for common cold.

287
00:39:47,106 --> 00:39:53,016
That’s why it is important to know medicine.

288
00:39:53,265 --> 00:40:01,876
You have to study clinical medicine before you can really evaluate what is happening with the case.

289
00:40:01,976 --> 00:40:11,124
Otherwise it will be like the doctors who just come out of the university,

290
00:40:11,224 --> 00:40:17,378
they have no experience, they send them in different villages.

291
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:27,346
Here in Greece they have to go on a village for one year to learn medicine by themselves.

292
00:40:27,618 --> 00:40:35,026
What happens is that all the doctors they are sending to the big hospital

293
00:40:35,298 --> 00:40:40,911
in big cities hundreds of people that had nothing.

294
00:40:41,187 --> 00:40:47,826
They were not ill, they had nothing serious.

295
00:40:48,098 --> 00:40:52,707
But their inexperience made them so afraid that they sent them.

296
00:40:52,946 --> 00:41:05,631
On the other hand, I could hear for instance in a case of diabetic coma

297
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:25,464
where the doctor gives IV saline with sugar to bring back the patient.

298
00:41:25,987 --> 00:41:33,398
Patient never came back. This can happen even with medical doctors.

299
00:41:35,186 --> 00:41:40,824
As homeopaths we have to have 3 times more education than the medical doctors

300
00:41:41,071 --> 00:41:44,044
to be able to evaluate a situation correctly,

301
00:41:44,144 --> 00:41:52,548
otherwise both the patient and the doctor will go cuckoo.

302
00:41:58,948 --> 00:42:13,545
I have seen total inadequacy. We go back to her.

303
00:42:13,814 --> 00:42:24,549
Therefore Nat-s. is a remedy which can be indicated for her and Aur. is another remedy

304
00:42:24,824 --> 00:42:30,708
which can be indicated for her and Staph. is another remedy that can be indicated.

305
00:42:30,949 --> 00:42:39,768
All 3 remedies have good indications.

306
00:42:41,828 --> 00:42:56,147
Let’s see what VES says. Aur., Aur-s., Sep., Nat-s. Why Nat-s.?

307
00:43:01,028 --> 00:43:07,428
The seaside air aggravation is very interesting.

308
00:43:07,667 --> 00:44:11,939
Let me see Aur. Show me Sep. Nat-m. Show me Psor. Puls.

309
00:44:13,712 --> 00:44:48,007
Ambition is not is Staph.? Aur-s.? Add one; ailments sudden bad news.

310
00:44:58,019 --> 00:45:33,025
3. Aur., Nat-m. as second possibility. Aversion salt.

311
00:45:33,294 --> 00:45:39,214
Not aversion but... normal. Aversion fish, definitely?

312
00:45:39,704 --> 00:45:51,124
– Not definitely but other things from the sea never ever.

313
00:45:51,304 --> 00:45:56,185
Fish, if I have to, if there is nothing else maybe. But I don’t like it.

314
00:45:56,665 --> 00:46:01,700
– Fat of meat?
– Ok, sometimes.

315
00:46:03,988 --> 00:46:06,904
– Eggs?
– Sometimes.

316
00:46:07,184 --> 00:46:10,744
- Soft/ hard boiled?
– Sometimes. Anything.

317
00:46:11,024 --> 00:46:16,654
– If the egg is not boiled well?
– Very soft?

318
00:46:16,905 --> 00:46:22,544
– Slimy.
– No!

319
00:46:22,787 --> 00:46:35,587
– Worse in the sea.
- Fruits?

320
00:46:35,854 --> 00:46:40,707
– While I was pregnant I had to have a lot of fruits.

321
00:46:40,974 --> 00:46:45,304
But usually just occasionally.

322
00:46:45,584 --> 00:46:50,388
– What was the best?
– Fruits, peaches while I was pregnant.

323
00:46:50,906 --> 00:46:56,290
I was craving for peaches but just during pregnancy.

324
00:46:59,348 --> 00:47:08,663
– Show me the rubric ailments from hearing sudden news.

325
00:47:08,904 --> 00:47:16,858
Gels. and Calc. Calc-p. is not there.

326
00:47:42,454 --> 00:47:46,294
– Is it justified to take the rubric sea air,

327
00:47:46,548 --> 00:47:51,668
aggravates because she has aversion to the smell of the sea.

328
00:47:52,184 --> 00:47:59,094
There is no aggravation, there is strong aversion that what she keeps on telling all the time.

329
00:47:59,348 --> 00:48:07,028
That is why she dislikes the sea and everything that comes from the sea.

330
00:48:07,269 --> 00:48:10,614
Is it justifies to use the rubric sea air aggravates?

331
00:48:10,868 --> 00:48:14,949
– You can take it but not base your prescription on that.

332
00:48:15,224 --> 00:48:19,574
You cannot say because she has that then I give this remedy.

333
00:48:19,828 --> 00:48:26,228
But you can take it because she says definitely forget the sea for me,

334
00:48:26,469 --> 00:48:29,814
I want to go to the woods.

335
00:48:30,068 --> 00:48:35,704
You can take it but cannot base your prescription upon it.

336
00:48:35,945 --> 00:48:41,334
It is not very clear. She said she wants to kill herself by shooting.

337
00:48:41,588 --> 00:48:46,454
That is something you have to have.

338
00:48:46,949 --> 00:48:58,895
– So she had aversion to sweets but actually now she eats the sweets.

339
00:49:00,426 --> 00:49:09,386
– Yes. Also you can take it out. No problem.

340
00:49:10,666 --> 00:49:14,506
– Is also there is that rubric anxiety, conscience of.

341
00:49:14,745 --> 00:49:17,066
What is the reason of that rubric?

342
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:31,908
- Because she has bad conscience about the way she handles her child. This is what she said.

343
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:41,386
– And also afternoon sleep aggravation is not a very severe aggravation.

344
00:49:41,900 --> 00:50:00,086
– Sure. I asked her and he has put it afternoon aggravates.
– 2 marks.

345
00:50:00,225 --> 00:50:07,820
– You can even take it out.
– Thank you.

346
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:22,148
– I don’t tell them what to put! I don’t even look.

347
00:50:42,628 --> 00:51:02,860
– Can you think Pall.
– Show her Pall. In Aur. is there no ambition?

348
00:51:03,865 --> 00:51:15,105
There is no ambition. Incomplete repertory!

349
00:51:15,621 --> 00:51:24,304
I have said many times this is characteristic of especially of Aur. children.

350
00:51:26,107 --> 00:51:35,601
– I would like to know about the effect music has upon you.

351
00:51:35,847 --> 00:51:39,300
– I like music very much, I am very sensitive to music,

352
00:51:39,546 --> 00:51:48,770
I can cry and be happy from music and if you will put the wrong music I can be very angry.

353
00:51:49,024 --> 00:51:55,856
– What is the wrong music for you?
– Very strong, disco music. I hate it.

354
00:51:56,864 --> 00:52:00,944
 I love music, I sing a lot and I play the piano.

355
00:52:01,465 --> 00:52:10,667
I like arts, not only music. Any kind of art.

356
00:52:13,745 --> 00:52:28,857
– I don’t see Ign. Do you know what my problem is here?

357
00:52:29,106 --> 00:52:38,828
My problem is that these remedies and perhaps one more is in series.

358
00:52:39,097 --> 00:52:42,422
Which one to start with is the question.

359
00:52:42,668 --> 00:52:50,617
There is no question that there is an Aur. substratum

360
00:52:50,866 --> 00:53:01,106
because she said at the age of 7 look mother I am the first!

361
00:53:03,907 --> 00:53:13,388
What happened during that time, the Aur. predisposition became stronger

362
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:23,906
or another layer was imposed upon because of that silent grief.

363
00:53:24,173 --> 00:53:29,544
Put ailments of silent grief.

364
00:53:35,426 --> 00:53:45,933
Do we have to start with Nat-m. or Staph. before we go to Aur. or can we go straightaway to Aur.

365
00:53:46,428 --> 00:53:54,893
because she has definitely the main points of Aur.

366
00:53:55,144 --> 00:54:07,426
which is suicidal depression but she does not want to jump from high place.

367
00:54:09,224 --> 00:54:17,628
That would make me immediately say that Aur. is the uppermost remedy at the moment.

368
00:54:17,892 --> 00:54:22,706
When she says shooting, though Aur. has shooting as well,

369
00:54:22,947 --> 00:54:28,023
when I ask her what is her best time I expect to hear to hear

370
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:33,427
that the best time is in the evening when Aur. eases in evening

371
00:54:33,666 --> 00:54:39,146
but she says morning time is my best time and in the evening

372
00:54:39,247 --> 00:54:41,824
because my husband is there.

373
00:54:42,068 --> 00:54:54,384
Another thing Aur. by itself can manage, does not need the help of others,

374
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:58,986
does not need to have support from somebody.

375
00:54:59,255 --> 00:55:07,467
They are self-determined and self-efficient people.

376
00:55:07,706 --> 00:55:17,456
She says I am self-sufficient very much but except of this area.

377
00:55:17,707 --> 00:55:19,106
Do you we have to treat this area?

378
00:55:19,373 --> 00:55:27,304
Do we have to take away this before Aur. picture becomes clear?

379
00:55:27,548 --> 00:55:38,824
And if then if what I am thinking is correct what is the uppermost remedy

380
00:55:38,959 --> 00:55:50,415
that will be best for her, Nat-m., Staph. or Nat-s.?

381
00:55:52,185 --> 00:56:02,948
The type of battle she has is very characteristic of Nat-s.

382
00:56:03,215 --> 00:56:10,380
but I am not sure if this is so because I put these words into her mind.

383
00:56:10,628 --> 00:56:15,125
I said, do you feel that and she said yes exactly.

384
00:56:15,225 --> 00:56:18,186
But I still doubt when I ask a question

385
00:56:18,425 --> 00:56:23,055
because a little one here was asking why do you ask direct questions,

386
00:56:23,306 --> 00:56:33,295
when you put a direct question and you get an answer it will depend on the type of the answer you get.

387
00:56:33,546 --> 00:56:37,900
Oh yes! This is an answer you can rely on.

388
00:56:38,148 --> 00:56:52,495
Yes, yes... Uh-oh. Yes... uh-oh. Yes. Forget it!

389
00:56:52,746 --> 00:56:56,825
It depends on how strong the answer you get is.

390
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:09,537
The time you touch the real symptom the idea of the patient is how did he know?

391
00:57:10,817 --> 00:57:20,698
I am a magician! If you spot the remedy and then you ask a keynote and he says yes,

392
00:57:20,947 --> 00:57:26,824
my God that is the time you can rely on that symptom.

393
00:57:27,347 --> 00:57:33,224
But if you get yes or there is little bit of hesitation...

394
00:57:34,778 --> 00:57:45,267
She gave me an answer which is Nat-s. quite strongly but still...

395
00:57:45,508 --> 00:57:53,704
I also know another thing about Nat-s; Nat-s. people are otherwise quite balanced.

396
00:57:54,227 --> 00:58:01,284
Except of this particular time when they get tired of life and they don’t want to live.

397
00:58:01,384 --> 00:58:07,167
Forget for me there is no place.

398
00:58:07,267 --> 00:58:10,067
But at the same time they think if they do

399
00:58:10,339 --> 00:58:16,228
it they are going to give such big problems to their relatives and they won’t do it.

400
00:58:16,467 --> 00:58:24,912
And then the next moment they go again and think they cannot stand it.

401
00:58:25,445 --> 00:58:35,704
– I didn’t have it before I had a family. It’s only because I am a mother.

402
00:58:35,945 --> 00:58:39,785
Before when I thought about committing suicide it wasn’t

403
00:58:40,054 --> 00:58:43,894
because of my husband or my mother that I didn’t do that.

404
00:58:44,148 --> 00:58:49,785
It is only because now I have a baby. It changed.

405
00:58:50,026 --> 00:59:06,145
– There is another thing about her in the point of view of psychoanalysis which is very interesting.

406
00:59:07,425 --> 00:59:16,144
She is not certain that she is a good mother, doing well.

407
00:59:16,965 --> 00:59:27,146
Because her mother has put into her mind the doubt into her mind through her behavior.

408
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:34,096
That the mother can misbehave and don’t understand what is doing, killing the child.

409
00:59:34,586 --> 00:59:37,103
You are killing me and you don’t understand!

410
00:59:37,346 --> 00:59:39,906
This is why she was crying all the time.

411
00:59:40,162 --> 00:59:44,785
Now what has happened is the doubt whatever I do

412
00:59:45,057 --> 00:59:48,897
maybe I am killing my child and I don’t realize it!

413
00:59:49,148 --> 00:59:55,548
She has the same problem. She says yes.

414
00:59:55,812 --> 01:00:00,191
– What about her anger that she was having against the mother

415
01:00:00,291 --> 01:00:03,171
when she was not treating well.

416
01:00:03,425 --> 01:00:09,783
She was still keeping it, she didn’t show that to the mother. That’s suppressed.

417
01:00:10,024 --> 01:00:20,787
– That’s why we said the possibility of Staph. is a big one. We’ll see.

418
01:00:21,818 --> 01:00:35,383
– There are some good symptoms which I gathered for Staph.

419
01:00:35,624 --> 01:00:39,464
Number one anger suppressed, anger with silent grief,

420
01:00:39,738 --> 01:00:45,107
and anger with mortification and indignation because when she wanted to speak to her mother

421
01:00:45,348 --> 01:00:51,064
about the good marks she was immediately mortified with the statement and the behavior of the mother

422
01:00:51,344 --> 01:00:56,464
and there is a rubric fear bringing up his family.

423
01:00:56,707 --> 01:01:04,144
Your family as a child could be part of the family, Staph. is a remedy in that rubric then,

424
01:01:04,387 --> 01:01:10,787
grief silent laughing involuntary, sleep disturbed due to thoughts and sleeplessness

425
01:01:11,054 --> 01:01:19,224
due to activity of thought, suicide by shooting, suicide disposition and desire for death.

426
01:01:19,504 --> 01:01:22,574
All these symptoms are covered by Staph.

427
01:01:22,825 --> 01:01:28,184
– That’s what we have been thinking. Correct.

428
01:01:36,344 --> 01:02:07,631
– Show me silent grief. I have a problem.

429
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:20,431
Let us say the uppermost layer is Nat-m.

430
01:02:20,707 --> 01:02:29,144
For a person to be Nat-m. has to have some closeness which she doesn’t appear to have

431
01:02:29,667 --> 01:02:33,746
though she says she kept anger inside.

432
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:39,970
She is not a close person, she spoke easily about her emotions,

433
01:02:40,224 --> 01:02:46,868
about what is happening inside her with great presence.

434
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:58,225
I have this problem for Nat-m.
- Nat-m. has no ambition.

435
01:02:58,392 --> 01:03:09,552
– Who said that? That is not true. Don’t believe that.

436
01:03:11,372 --> 01:03:28,268
Ailments from mortification. Yes, you can say so.

437
01:03:28,507 --> 01:03:46,062
For Staph. what is the problem? Staph. has a problem showing anger

438
01:03:46,315 --> 01:03:57,132
and during the anger if it is so much she cannot retain it she has the tendency to throw things and hit.

439
01:03:57,388 --> 01:04:14,764
She expresses her anger in her relationship but with her mother... forget it.

440
01:04:14,864 --> 01:04:21,582
Why she expresses her anger to her husband?

441
01:04:21,825 --> 01:04:28,492
Because he loves you, you released me from saying that.

442
01:04:28,748 --> 01:04:37,947
So you know it very well and you know you can do that and no consequences.

443
01:04:38,222 --> 01:04:48,187
He will forgive you, he will say it is her character.

444
01:04:48,462 --> 01:04:51,788
– I don’t do it so often.

445
01:04:52,302 --> 01:04:57,252
– But if the occasion arises you have to do it.

446
01:05:03,052 --> 01:05:18,145
It’s not pure Staph., Nat-m., Aur., Ign. Other remedies? Sep.

447
01:05:18,412 --> 01:05:24,302
I don’t believe. The Aur. is the strongest.

448
01:05:27,628 --> 01:05:31,024
But is Aur. the uppermost or we give Aur.,

449
01:05:31,267 --> 01:05:40,984
nothing happens and then we have to change?

450
01:05:41,507 --> 01:06:01,464
Show me also the rubric mortification.

451
01:06:10,948 --> 01:06:20,665
You said this eruption you have it since childhood.

452
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:27,588
– In my nails I had it first when I was 17

453
01:06:27,855 --> 01:06:36,300
and then I took pills and it passed away and then it came back again after I took Puls.

454
01:06:36,548 --> 01:06:41,668
And the eczema is something I have since I was very young

455
01:06:41,935 --> 01:06:47,545
and it changes places all the time and all my family has this kind of problems.

456
01:06:49,066 --> 01:06:56,708
– When you didn’t show your anger to your mother were you afraid of being reproached?

457
01:06:56,975 --> 01:07:06,700
– Not reproached. Beaten! I slept outside.
– Staph.

458
01:07:11,863 --> 01:07:14,704
– I would like to ask 2 questions.

459
01:07:14,947 --> 01:07:25,454
Do you like perform before an audience?
– I feel very good.

460
01:07:26,224 --> 01:07:40,304
– Now, you messed up the whole thing! I used to be an actress and a singer.

461
01:07:45,934 --> 01:07:59,404
– That means you can be trained to overcome certain sensitivities or shyness.

462
01:07:59,504 --> 01:08:02,304
– I never had shyness.

463
01:08:02,576 --> 01:08:09,743
Since I was a child I used to sit on the table and sing for everybody and dance and make jokes

464
01:08:09,986 --> 01:08:15,868
and be the center of every place I have been at.

465
01:08:19,708 --> 01:08:23,053
– Do you get offended easily?

466
01:08:23,304 --> 01:08:33,026
– I think very easily by people that are important to me. Yes.

467
01:08:52,688 --> 01:08:58,008
– You see how difficult it really is to make a decision.

468
01:08:58,108 --> 01:09:05,024
When I saw her she said spoke 2 words and I asked have you not taken Aur.?

469
01:09:05,168 --> 01:09:06,966
It’s very strange.

470
01:09:07,333 --> 01:09:19,503
But if you dig you may find out that you may be right or wrong maybe first this and then that.

471
01:09:20,013 --> 01:09:22,968
Classical Homeopathy is not easy

472
01:09:23,143 --> 01:09:33,893
because it’s such the precision you need to have the effect otherwise forget it!

473
01:09:38,946 --> 01:09:43,908
– In spite of being in a suicidal depression she has this fungal infection.

474
01:09:44,147 --> 01:09:46,028
I think this is a sign of good health.

475
01:09:46,546 --> 01:09:57,146
Is she not showing a clear picture of a remedy

476
01:09:57,308 --> 01:10:06,307
because even in a suicidal depression her organism is having this fungal infection...?

477
01:10:06,828 --> 01:10:08,767
- I feel he is right.

478
01:10:08,867 --> 01:10:14,227
Because when I am not ill I feel like I am the healthiest person in the world

479
01:10:14,499 --> 01:10:22,416
and when I’m sick I’m totally depressed.

480
01:10:27,021 --> 01:10:29,824
– I’d like to ask 2 questions.

481
01:10:31,627 --> 01:10:40,826
When you are angry before you start shouting?

482
01:10:41,106 --> 01:10:43,664
Do you have any physical signs of anger?

483
01:10:43,941 --> 01:10:47,011
– No. If I feel it is a person that I can show my anger,

484
01:10:47,265 --> 01:10:52,634
I just show it and if not I’m leaving and maybe crying.

485
01:10:52,922 --> 01:10:59,242
– But is it true that you show anger only to your husband?

486
01:10:59,342 --> 01:11:04,264
– Only to my husband.
– I had 2 husbands. This is my second.

487
01:11:04,508 --> 01:11:09,628
And also to my first one.

488
01:11:12,144 --> 01:11:18,025
Also to my husbands because I feel very safe there and very loved.

489
01:11:18,264 --> 01:11:21,347
I know I can be myself. I can show everything not only anger.

490
01:11:21,614 --> 01:11:29,545
I wouldn’t also cry in front of my mother. Never.

491
01:11:30,307 --> 01:11:33,304
– The second question I have is

492
01:11:33,584 --> 01:11:38,947
do you have any problems with infections of your eyes?
– No.

493
01:11:39,465 --> 01:11:48,325
– I believe that as a girl she did not have the depression of Aur.

494
01:11:48,425 --> 01:11:53,338
but she had the possibility of being an Aur. case.

495
01:11:53,828 --> 01:12:10,505
Now this blow came and I believe due to the thyroid effect that she became a Nat-m. case.

496
01:12:14,094 --> 01:12:20,745
The responsibility of the child is the last thing that we have to deal with.

497
01:12:20,984 --> 01:12:31,504
We have to find the remedy that has this anxiety with dealing with a responsibility.

498
01:12:31,747 --> 01:12:39,945
Which is like Bar-c. Bar-c. doesn’t want the responsibility.

499
01:12:41,225 --> 01:12:48,144
In that case we have a very good reason why she behaves like that.

500
01:12:48,387 --> 01:13:01,944
The mother embedded in her psyche that you can inflict so much pain to the child unknowingly

501
01:13:02,224 --> 01:13:06,725
and this is what she is going through.

502
01:13:06,825 --> 01:13:15,939
Therefore I consider that the remedy we have to give as uppermost is neither Aur.,

503
01:13:16,185 --> 01:13:29,747
nor Nat-m. is a remedy that will have a kind of lack of self-confidence

504
01:13:33,148 --> 01:13:39,825
or lack of undertaking the responsibility.

505
01:13:44,504 --> 01:14:00,824
From a very ambitious and sufficient person she has become insufficient in this respect at least.

506
01:14:11,064 --> 01:14:24,105
Out of the 3-4 remedies which is the remedy that is the weakest in this respect.

507
01:14:24,374 --> 01:14:36,664
Staph. So the treatment must start with Staph.

508
01:14:37,174 --> 01:14:48,948
and then most probably Nat-m. as a second possibility or Nat-s. Nat-m. and Nat-s. can be exchangeable.

509
01:14:49,489 --> 01:14:59,945
And finally we can reach the layer of Aur.

510
01:15:00,214 --> 01:15:19,668
So Staph., very high, hoping that she will start shouting to her husband as well and be completely suppressed.

511
01:15:20,694 --> 01:15:31,429
- I want to say 2 things. I think of Pall.

512
01:15:31,704 --> 01:15:38,614
And if you can see now in the list it’s coming up.

513
01:15:41,444 --> 01:15:52,655
I want to check the remedy with you and I want to ask her one more question.

514
01:15:57,305 --> 01:16:02,948
You say that you love to be in company, you love company very much.

515
01:16:03,215 --> 01:16:09,348
Does it exhaust you after a while?

516
01:16:09,604 --> 01:16:49,052
– Usually the opposite happens.
– Show me Ign. Show me Staph.

517
01:16:49,552 --> 01:16:55,180
The thing is as you can see really if you study the case,

518
01:16:55,428 --> 01:17:01,828
that the symptoms may be so similar from one remedy to the other.

519
01:17:02,095 --> 01:17:03,544
The point is what kind of analysis,

520
01:17:03,824 --> 01:17:09,944
what kind of evaluation we are doing in these particular symptoms.

521
01:17:10,224 --> 01:17:16,867
You have to take some symptoms which you can base a prescription upon.

522
01:17:17,391 --> 01:17:23,298
Here there was a very difficult differentiation point

523
01:17:23,791 --> 01:17:30,367
but I feel that as she says shooting is so strongly

524
01:17:30,467 --> 01:17:35,987
and experience shows that Staph. really wants to shoot herself

525
01:17:36,228 --> 01:17:42,179
and also the fact that she admits she has suppressed her anger for years,

526
01:17:42,425 --> 01:17:44,228
there is no question about that.

527
01:17:44,467 --> 01:17:49,587
That means if you give Staph. will she be released totally? No.

528
01:17:49,859 --> 01:17:57,785
To a certain extent and then comes Nat-m. which will help her a little bit more

529
01:17:58,032 --> 01:18:08,672
and finally will come Aur. So Staph. 50M for a start.

530
01:18:24,682 --> 01:18:30,346
You can ask some questions actually.

531
01:18:30,585 --> 01:18:40,825
– I wanted to say that I saw her a few days ago sitting and singing

532
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:52,868
and she was the center of us, not like Staph. Absolutely not.

533
01:18:53,135 --> 01:18:56,460
– But I’ll tell you something.

534
01:18:59,268 --> 01:19:06,425
Her character, her personality is very extrovert.

535
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:13,348
Such extrovert personality as she has to be kept inside such anger,

536
01:19:14,105 --> 01:19:21,546
that fact points to the possibility of Staph.

537
01:19:21,785 --> 01:19:27,946
because she is not a sensitive and very closed person.

538
01:19:28,185 --> 01:19:36,388
She is extrovert, strong yet and she has this kind of indignation.

539
01:19:36,655 --> 01:19:39,171
I don’t want your sympathy.

540
01:19:39,425 --> 01:19:49,904
You go to hell I will stay here in the bathroom till my next life.

541
01:19:53,577 --> 01:20:01,105
This is a behavior which can be Nat-m., Staph. and Aur. also.

542
01:20:01,377 --> 01:20:09,826
But the fact that she keeps the anger, she says I want to kill my mother very gladly.

543
01:20:10,037 --> 01:20:16,688
I hate. And she cannot express any of this anger,

544
01:20:17,252 --> 01:20:25,186
after Staph. she most probably will go and tell her mother what she thinks about her.

545
01:20:25,425 --> 01:20:29,504
You don’t believe? Let’s see what you will say next time.

546
01:20:30,266 --> 01:20:38,864
She will say I could not believe I went to my mother and said you’re a bitch!

547
01:20:41,786 --> 01:20:54,695
Ok, don’t do that! I don’t advise you because your mother will come to me!

548
01:21:06,855 --> 01:21:28,505
When we give a description of a remedy in the M.M. we actually describe what we call the constitutional type,

549
01:21:29,785 --> 01:21:37,465
the full type of Ign., Nat-m., Staph.

550
01:21:37,706 --> 01:21:49,495
But as I have explained many times, the full type is somebody who is quite healthy,

551
01:21:49,744 --> 01:21:54,615
needs one remedy and that one remedy will take away everything.

552
01:21:54,864 --> 01:22:01,338
This happens seldom. The most usual is to have layers.

553
01:22:03,305 --> 01:22:09,189
As you describe here your thought why not Ign.?

554
01:22:09,464 --> 01:22:21,989
It is true, in a case of constitutional Aur. some grief comes upon and that changes into an Ign. pattern.

555
01:22:22,505 --> 01:22:26,345
And this Ign. pattern may stay for years.

556
01:22:26,614 --> 01:22:37,624
And if this person goes into a state of let’s say pneumonia, mistreated,

557
01:22:38,134 --> 01:22:45,545
it may after the pneumonia develop a picture of Kali-c.

558
01:22:46,068 --> 01:22:51,062
And this picture of Kali-c. will stay there so when you start the treatment

559
01:22:51,577 --> 01:22:57,187
you have to give Kali-c. then Ign. then Aur.

560
01:22:57,462 --> 01:23:05,657
That means the two layers that were corrected, they came after.

561
01:23:05,906 --> 01:23:13,068
The Aur. or Sulph. underneath here or Calc.

562
01:23:13,337 --> 01:23:19,222
Let us say you have this person with these 3 remedies.

563
01:23:19,468 --> 01:23:24,588
He doesn’t take homeopathic treatment and then grief comes

564
01:23:24,857 --> 01:23:31,427
and upon the grief is imprinted a state of Ign.

565
01:23:31,948 --> 01:23:36,057
Another example that you’ll understand easier.

566
01:23:36,547 --> 01:23:42,706
Let’s say you have a case where a person got a concussion,

567
01:23:42,947 --> 01:23:57,317
felt down and hit and had a big trauma for which he needed Arn.

568
01:23:57,566 --> 01:23:59,065
But never got Arn.

569
01:23:59,312 --> 01:24:04,941
He comes to you 10 years after the trauma and underneath may be a Sulph. or Calc.

570
01:24:05,184 --> 01:24:13,387
but unless you give Arn. first, you give Arn. 50M then the case opens up.

571
01:24:13,626 --> 01:24:23,866
Then the Arn. level that was imprinted after the trauma must come out first and then go deep.

572
01:24:24,141 --> 01:24:30,266
Unless you give the Arn. you are not going to help this particular case.

573
01:24:30,541 --> 01:24:34,896
And you know that very well, right? That same with Nat-s.

574
01:24:35,147 --> 01:24:43,241
Somebody has an injury and then he gets depressed and then he goes into a state of Nat-s.

575
01:24:43,341 --> 01:24:46,906
It is after the trauma, after the concussion.

576
01:24:47,181 --> 01:24:53,824
Then you give Nat-s. and then underneath is Sep. or whatever.

577
01:24:54,000 --> 01:25:02,147
So we have cases in which a layer is imprinted and stays.
