1
00:00:17,505 --> 00:00:23,414
Ruth, tell me, how you have been feeling?

2
00:00:23,664 --> 00:00:28,022
– When I look back I remember how scared I was that I would never work again.

3
00:00:28,264 --> 00:00:31,862
I thought that was the end because I tried Homeopathy I had faith in Homeopathy

4
00:00:32,104 --> 00:00:37,494
but it wasn’t working for me. You prescribed Lac-c.

5
00:00:37,744 --> 00:00:45,174
I started with 200C and in days I started to feel I could climb the mountain again.

6
00:00:45,424 --> 00:00:52,065
And I didn’t go back carefully. I just threw myself back into my work.

7
00:00:52,584 --> 00:00:55,905
And I was amazed, I was very strong

8
00:00:56,182 --> 00:00:59,788
but then again I would start to feel myself dropped and I took another Lac-c. 200C.

9
00:01:00,064 --> 00:01:02,864
I can’t remember what time it was. That was 2 years ago.

10
00:01:03,137 --> 00:01:09,024
I took Lac-c. 200C a few times and then I took 1M and even up to 10M.

11
00:01:09,264 --> 00:01:13,104
And then last year in June, July.

12
00:01:13,377 --> 00:01:17,217
Before June, July there was an election and there was huge work.

13
00:01:18,497 --> 00:01:26,140
I felt I was carrying that load again and it’s different

14
00:01:26,284 --> 00:01:31,304
if you’re a member of the parliament in opposition and if you are a member of a deputy minister

15
00:01:31,574 --> 00:01:33,345
or you are in the ruling party.

16
00:01:33,622 --> 00:01:36,324
I would be more important if I was in the ruling party.

17
00:01:36,424 --> 00:01:41,514
But I am in opposition. It’s a struggle.

18
00:01:41,664 --> 00:01:43,684
But anyway we did very well in the election.

19
00:01:43,784 --> 00:01:51,464
I helped to change my province, 3 people became 27 and afterwards it was like a plateau.

20
00:01:51,534 --> 00:01:54,094
I just suddenly crushed again.

21
00:01:54,544 --> 00:02:02,742
And I started to cough the green-brown mucus again. I became very weak.

22
00:02:03,254 --> 00:02:09,654
I’ve got laryngitis, I lost my voice.

23
00:02:09,804 --> 00:02:15,784
But I knew those with things going back, to my past settled well, maybe it is not so serious

24
00:02:16,054 --> 00:02:21,162
but I remembered that I actually took antibiotics because I was into my daughter’s wedding.

25
00:02:22,704 --> 00:02:31,905
And I was just fading. The Lac-c. wasn’t working so I took antibiotics.

26
00:02:32,182 --> 00:02:37,264
I got over the cough. My throat got better but I still wasn’t well

27
00:02:37,437 --> 00:02:40,864
and I remembered that you had said, Stan. is a possibility.

28
00:02:41,104 --> 00:02:45,304
– As next remedy. So what happened with Stan.?

29
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:50,700
– I took Stan. 200C and back in 24 hours. I got better.

30
00:02:50,944 --> 00:02:54,784
When I find the right remedy it is quite amazing how quickly it works on me.

31
00:02:55,052 --> 00:02:58,624
When I don’t...it floats over my head.

32
00:02:58,892 --> 00:03:02,464
And then again I went back into parliament.

33
00:03:02,632 --> 00:03:07,340
I’ve only gone up to Stan. just before I came here again the work, the pressure...

34
00:03:07,584 --> 00:03:11,692
many things mounting, having to arrange with my family...

35
00:03:11,944 --> 00:03:18,344
I felt going down again so I took Stan 1M. And you can see I’m ok.

36
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,204
I’m quite positive and I feel I am talking strongly and working very hard.

37
00:03:23,304 --> 00:03:30,804
I’ve had a big battle. I’ve achieved some things.

38
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:38,500
– I remember you were saying that’s the end, I cannot continue, I will give up...

39
00:03:38,644 --> 00:03:43,824
- I thought I’d never work again.
– You are working even more than before.

40
00:03:44,097 --> 00:03:47,324
– Yes. You took off this wholeness.

41
00:03:47,424 --> 00:03:52,544
I feel as if I’m working with more calmness, more acceptance. It used to distress me.

42
00:03:52,784 --> 00:03:57,537
I don’t get the migraines anymore. I can even think of snakes.

43
00:03:57,784 --> 00:04:03,424
Remember I told you I couldn’t think of snakes without going into a sort of panic.

44
00:04:03,937 --> 00:04:12,897
I can even try to make myself see snakes in TV, think about snakes. It’s part of nature.

45
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:18,264
I can cope with it and I don’t freak as that about my children. I never lose that.

46
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,857
My deepest concern still is my children’s health.

47
00:04:22,004 --> 00:04:31,308
Within that world I know I am more susceptible. My worst problem is still my back.

48
00:04:31,484 --> 00:04:37,464
If I sit in the plane for 10 hours the people next door want throw me out of the window.

49
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:42,614
– You are restless.
– Yes even sitting here...

50
00:04:42,864 --> 00:04:47,222
- You become restless and what type of pain is it?

51
00:04:47,464 --> 00:04:50,024
– It’s a deep ache. Sometimes a burning pain.

52
00:04:50,294 --> 00:04:54,625
And the worst one is between my shoulder blades.

53
00:04:57,462 --> 00:05:04,374
And it’s better when I move around. It’s hard for me to sit.

54
00:05:06,564 --> 00:05:16,144
And even in parliament I hate it to sit down. I like to go out and work.

55
00:05:16,904 --> 00:05:22,024
– Because a lot of people are thinking of a remedy at this moment, tell me,

56
00:05:22,294 --> 00:05:25,864
you are on the cold side or warm?

57
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:33,025
– Very much the cold side. I can’t bear cold. I don’t like extremes of weather.

58
00:05:33,302 --> 00:05:40,705
Severe heat makes me tired but I am coping with this. But I cannot bear the cold.

59
00:05:41,224 --> 00:05:46,864
– Can you bear drafts?
– No, very sensitive to drafts.

60
00:05:47,105 --> 00:05:51,734
I like air but I hate drafts.

61
00:05:52,225 --> 00:05:59,144
– The night in bed you can sit in one place or you have to change frequently?

62
00:05:59,414 --> 00:06:04,264
– I think I change quite a lot. But I lie on my back now.

63
00:06:04,534 --> 00:06:10,934
I put a cushion under my legs and I’ve tried to train myself to lie on the back.

64
00:06:11,184 --> 00:06:19,624
– Your legs in bed are quiet or restless?
– I think they are quiet.

65
00:06:23,222 --> 00:06:28,065
– You eat eggs?
– Yes. I like eggs.

66
00:06:28,584 --> 00:06:31,144
– Milk?
– I like milk.

67
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,624
– You take plain milk and drink?

68
00:06:33,868 --> 00:06:38,988
– Cold milk. I don’t like hot milk but I like hot tea.

69
00:06:42,064 --> 00:06:49,104
– How much milk you take?
– Not a lot.

70
00:06:49,277 --> 00:06:52,944
I don’t drink a lot of cold milk because I know it’s not particularly healthy.

71
00:06:53,217 --> 00:07:00,897
I like warm Milo.
– Your nails are strong?

72
00:07:01,044 --> 00:07:11,384
– Not very strong. I’ve got ridges on my nails and I get that cracking on the edges of the fingers.

73
00:07:11,904 --> 00:07:17,537
– Do you perspire at all during sleep?
– No.

74
00:07:17,784 --> 00:07:21,624
– And you cover yourself?
– Very much.

75
00:07:21,768 --> 00:07:26,988
Even in this weather I will have to be covered.

76
00:07:29,548 --> 00:07:39,788
– The anxiety about your children is pathological or you say after all you say it’s normal?

77
00:07:40,064 --> 00:07:46,704
– I think it’s more normal but I think I am more concerned about my children than most mothers.

78
00:07:46,977 --> 00:07:53,104
There are out of the country and if I know they are not well it’s on my mind all the time.

79
00:07:53,377 --> 00:07:55,664
I immediately need to do something about it.

80
00:07:55,937 --> 00:07:59,264
But I am not as bad as I used to be.

81
00:08:03,344 --> 00:08:08,224
Ok we go inside and tell you how to continue.

82
00:08:12,424 --> 00:08:24,097
As I always say, in order to bring about cure we need correct remedies in correct sequence.

83
00:08:24,344 --> 00:08:34,337
Those who remember this case when we discussed the different possibilities

84
00:08:34,584 --> 00:08:38,668
and we came down to Lac-c. as the best prescription.

85
00:08:38,944 --> 00:08:42,784
Now, Lac-c. exhausted its action.

86
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:53,024
But it’s very difficult I had suggested Ruth in case Lac-c. exhausts its action,

87
00:08:53,164 --> 00:08:58,657
most probably she will need Stan.

88
00:08:58,904 --> 00:09:10,468
Because any homeopath who was not very careful would prescribe Stan in the first place.

89
00:09:10,644 --> 00:09:22,828
That would be wrong. Ruth said I cannot even talk.

90
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:31,024
Stan. is like this, they talk on the telephone and they make big effort to talk on the telephone.

91
00:09:31,544 --> 00:09:34,348
Their voice is almost gone.

92
00:09:34,624 --> 00:09:47,148
And when you hear that and when situation is so bad and dramatic as Ruth was describing,

93
00:09:47,424 --> 00:09:56,108
in the end of career I can’t continue, I am totally exhausted, I’m depleted of energy.

94
00:09:56,384 --> 00:10:02,564
Then you are tempted as first remedy to give Stan. That is wrong.

95
00:10:02,664 --> 00:10:10,344
Stan. would work but for a very short time, would show some effect and back to nothing.

96
00:10:10,614 --> 00:10:17,405
Now Lac-c. took first the first layer and she needed,

97
00:10:17,505 --> 00:10:29,304
and this is important also, repeated doses like the Nat-m. of Ernest. Nat-m. higher and higher,

98
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,624
exhausts its action and then Sep.

99
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:39,304
This is the same idea as we have been talking before.

100
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:53,624
You have to be aware, you have to be very careful when you prescribe homeopathic remedies.

101
00:10:56,372 --> 00:11:01,217
In the beginning Ruth was saying he gave me this and that,

102
00:11:01,464 --> 00:11:08,897
helped me in this and that, the end result is that Ruth is breaking down finally

103
00:11:09,144 --> 00:11:13,744
and that means little help here and there is not homeopathic prescription.

104
00:11:14,017 --> 00:11:21,888
Good homeopathic prescription must bring you back to functional conditions.

105
00:11:21,988 --> 00:11:28,502
To the best of your possibilities, of your potentials. This is Homeopathy.

106
00:11:28,744 --> 00:11:34,902
The other is... we give remedies. Ruth has taken 20 remedies.

107
00:11:35,044 --> 00:11:41,025
What for? Like every case that comes here of course.

108
00:11:41,302 --> 00:11:46,024
That does not mean that I will never give a wrong remedy.

109
00:11:46,294 --> 00:11:53,185
Of course I will, especially in complicated cases that have taken a lot of other remedies.

110
00:11:53,704 --> 00:12:03,702
I may not be able to see clearly what is the first remedy that we have to start with.

111
00:12:03,944 --> 00:12:12,385
But these examples show on the one hand what wrong Homeopathy will be doing

112
00:12:12,562 --> 00:12:18,294
and what correct Homeopathy is doing and the possibilities of correct Homeopathy.

113
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:32,374
And here now Ruth says I have back pain.

114
00:12:34,145 --> 00:12:44,904
And you are the practitioner and you have to decide what is the remedy that you’ll have to give.

115
00:12:49,506 --> 00:13:03,862
The first possibility is wait. The second possibility is same remedy.

116
00:13:04,004 --> 00:13:21,960
The third possibility is new remedy. The fourth possibility is same remedy higher potency.

117
00:13:22,104 --> 00:13:32,300
These are the possibilities you have to choose. These are your chances.

118
00:13:32,544 --> 00:13:39,704
You are supposed to take this case and you are going to tell me what you’ll do.

119
00:13:42,264 --> 00:14:04,344
Who says I would wait? 4. Same remedy? 2. New remedy? 6.

120
00:14:04,512 --> 00:14:14,384
Same remedy higher potency? 9. Majority loses.

121
00:14:15,664 --> 00:14:18,984
Unfortunately, it doesn’t always work this way.

122
00:14:24,104 --> 00:14:32,822
You don’t give Stan. when there is no this exhaustion.

123
00:14:33,064 --> 00:14:40,140
The main picture of Stan. is total exhaustion.

124
00:14:40,384 --> 00:14:47,052
I had described to you in the M.M., not to you, in the classes actually.

125
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:53,452
I have described the weakness and the tiredness of Stan. It’s unbelievable.

126
00:14:53,604 --> 00:15:02,664
Now, she doesn’t have it. She is very active. You go and give Stan. now?

127
00:15:02,804 --> 00:15:09,304
That means Stan. has at this moment exhausted its action or I don’t know if it has exhausted

128
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:15,212
but the problem is shall we wait?

129
00:15:15,464 --> 00:15:21,864
Or shall we give the same remedy or a new remedy?

130
00:15:22,104 --> 00:15:28,624
This is the problem. You don’t give the same remedy, definitely.

131
00:15:28,624 --> 00:15:34,348
Here it is not indicated. At this moment Stan. is not indicated.

132
00:15:34,624 --> 00:15:42,817
If you give she will has a proving, she says I prove the remedy and she will be weak.

133
00:15:45,104 --> 00:15:52,544
You have to choose between waiting and a new remedy.

134
00:15:55,364 --> 00:16:09,944
Here you have to judge 2 things; first, whether a new remedy picture is appearing.

135
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:17,104
If that is not there you better wait.

136
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:26,828
The second thing to judge is whether the patient at this moment is suffering to such an extent

137
00:16:27,104 --> 00:16:29,664
that you have to do something about it.

138
00:16:29,804 --> 00:16:36,064
So we have to judge whether Ruth is really suffering at this moment to the extent

139
00:16:36,304 --> 00:16:42,977
that we have to prescribe something because the suffering is quite a lot.

140
00:16:43,224 --> 00:16:58,064
If the remedy is clear, even if the suffering is not so much, you are entitled to give the remedy.

141
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:12,417
If the picture is not clear, even the suffering is quite strong, are you not entitled to give a remedy.

142
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:16,584
What will you do? Let her suffer? Yes, let her suffer.

143
00:17:16,854 --> 00:17:21,974
You say wait until the picture becomes clearer.

144
00:17:22,224 --> 00:17:31,944
Because in comparison to what she has been gone before now the suffering is 10%.

145
00:17:32,214 --> 00:17:44,564
Not even 10%. I will ask Ruth to make an estimation on the present situation in comparison to the beginning.

146
00:17:44,717 --> 00:17:48,812
– I think because the potential is still there always to go down.

147
00:17:49,064 --> 00:17:53,664
I feel as if I am not back to where I was when I was really a fit person.

148
00:17:53,912 --> 00:17:56,224
I’d say I still have 10%.

149
00:17:56,492 --> 00:18:03,144
My back is such a problem when I am on the plane that I really struggle to get sit for 10 hours.

150
00:18:03,284 --> 00:18:10,824
It’s quite intense. I endure it but for me it’s quite serious.

151
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:25,144
– Fair enough. As I said a cure takes place when the first layer is gone, the second layer is gone...

152
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:35,904
For Ruth we are this layer, third layer and what shall we give, what is the remedy?

153
00:18:36,424 --> 00:18:59,464
What is the remedy is very simple. It’s very clear. Puls. is very hot.

154
00:18:59,709 --> 00:19:13,784
Needs the air. She is very cold to the extent that with this weather she needs covers.

155
00:19:14,074 --> 00:19:25,584
Puls. will never do that. Puls. will never cover herself in hot room in summer.

156
00:19:25,757 --> 00:19:36,044
Therefore, Puls. is definitely not there. But you need a remedy which is very sensitive to cold.

157
00:19:36,365 --> 00:19:52,502
Who cannot stay still because of the pain in the back. Who desires cold milk?

158
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:19,624
We have suffering while sitting and better walking. She has to get up and move to be better.

159
00:20:19,894 --> 00:20:33,462
She is very cold, she does not like drafts and she likes cold milk. Very simple.

160
00:20:33,704 --> 00:20:50,104
Everybody recognizes the remedy which is Rhus-t. Very good.

161
00:20:51,284 --> 00:21:05,740
This is a signal from America that you are doing very bad work there! The CIA!

162
00:21:10,244 --> 00:21:24,464
So we will suggest that Ruth can use one dose of Rhus-t. 30C only,

163
00:21:24,564 --> 00:21:35,180
don’t go higher for the moment, and try not to exhaust yourself for a few days.

164
00:21:40,184 --> 00:22:07,824
Ruth’s tox! What is good about our school is that the students can observe all cases.

165
00:22:08,097 --> 00:22:17,548
We never hide any case. You see all the cases how they are doing.

166
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:31,424
I understand some of you are depressed but don’t bother.

167
00:22:31,692 --> 00:22:48,064
In 40 years you will be experts! I completed my 41th year of practice!
