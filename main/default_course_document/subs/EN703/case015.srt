1
00:00:16,624 --> 00:00:26,742
We look at the case of a child of how old?
– 3 and three fourths.

2
00:00:28,534 --> 00:00:47,222
– A report from the NHS by Dr. Mitchell...

3
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:53,345
Can you read the conclusion of the report?

4
00:00:53,622 --> 00:01:03,344
– He concluded that Alex has mixed developmental disorder predominately involving her speech and language

5
00:01:03,585 --> 00:01:12,304
but with some autistic features, an immature pattern of motor development and a disordered attention span.

6
00:01:12,545 --> 00:01:25,322
She may later develop dyspraxia. Alex has not been immunized at all by parental choice.

7
00:01:25,422 --> 00:01:36,865
– Did you take hormones in order to become pregnant?
– No, nothing.

8
00:01:37,904 --> 00:01:44,584
– And pregnancy was easy or took long time?
– Pregnancy was fine.

9
00:01:44,824 --> 00:01:58,184
I had to have a cesarean because she was in breech position and she came out early at about 38 weeks.

10
00:01:59,372 --> 00:02:04,748
– You have to give a little bit of you medical history.

11
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:20,897
– The medical history for myself; as child lots tonsillitis’ and one series of NSU,

12
00:02:21,144 --> 00:02:47,264
non-specific urethritis, acne rosacea and lots of... Lots of upper respiratory tract infections.

13
00:02:48,784 --> 00:02:58,784
– With a lot of antibiotics?
– No. Maybe when I was younger maybe one course.

14
00:03:01,857 --> 00:03:09,064
– Do you have other children?
– No, she’s our only one.

15
00:03:09,304 --> 00:03:25,184
– When did you marry?
– 1978. We were married 19 years when Alex was conceived.

16
00:03:25,452 --> 00:03:31,584
– Why?
– We don’t know!

17
00:03:33,384 --> 00:03:43,424
– There are 2 things; either you have been taking precaution measures and you did not have a child...

18
00:03:43,564 --> 00:03:46,948
- We did for 10 years but then...

19
00:03:47,124 --> 00:03:51,724
- For 10 years you did not want a child and you took protection

20
00:03:51,824 --> 00:04:00,268
and you did not have a voluntary abortion?
– No.

21
00:04:00,544 --> 00:04:07,544
– And after 10 years you decided to have a child. And you had free sex.

22
00:04:10,344 --> 00:04:19,424
Then you found out that there was no pregnancy and then you did something,

23
00:04:19,664 --> 00:04:27,105
took some medicine, or homeopathic medicine?
– No. It just happened.

24
00:04:27,344 --> 00:04:32,928
– You let it be.
– We thought it was fate. It’s not going to happen.

25
00:04:33,028 --> 00:04:34,384
So we didn’t worry about it.

26
00:04:34,657 --> 00:04:44,224
– We tried initially with an ovulation test but it’s not very romantic to sit there with a kit

27
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:50,524
so in the end we decided...
- If it’s not meant to be, it’s not meant to be

28
00:04:50,624 --> 00:05:00,152
but miraculously it happened and this is her.

29
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:13,644
– Let me understand. You were married at what age? 21. We met when I was 19.

30
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:21,960
– Was it your first affair?
– I had a relationship before my husband.

31
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,104
– No pregnancy before?

32
00:05:26,264 --> 00:05:40,384
Do you remember if you had precaution and you did not have pregnancy?

33
00:05:40,624 --> 00:05:52,664
– We didn’t. We used the rhythm method with my first relationship.

34
00:05:52,908 --> 00:05:56,664
– You were examined by a gynecologist?

35
00:05:56,732 --> 00:06:08,144
– No, because I didn’t want drugs or offer me lots of other things.

36
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:27,344
– It became a kind of problem for you,

37
00:06:27,617 --> 00:06:31,604
after a few years you saw that there was no child coming?

38
00:06:31,704 --> 00:06:34,744
– Yes, as the clock ticks away for any woman you do,

39
00:06:34,825 --> 00:06:40,064
you think I’m coming up to 40, Gosh this is it!

40
00:06:40,584 --> 00:06:44,940
I kept thinking maybe should go to the doctors but I really didn’t want to

41
00:06:45,184 --> 00:06:48,012
because I know they would suggest hormones.

42
00:06:48,164 --> 00:06:55,424
I thought maybe I should get checked out. I just delayed it and became pregnant.

43
00:06:57,264 --> 00:07:09,772
– So it came after 19 years of marriage.

44
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:31,184
– Here is my medical history...
- 15 months you had divergent squint.

45
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:41,217
– No this was the baby. She had a squint. It’s intermittent.

46
00:07:41,464 --> 00:07:44,652
– I saw it in the beginning and then it disappeared.

47
00:07:47,212 --> 00:07:51,372
– If she sits here it will happen because of the light.

48
00:07:51,524 --> 00:07:55,704
The bright light will take one eye here on the other way.

49
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:19,264
– The medical history is only for you here?

50
00:08:24,332 --> 00:08:29,944
Your father or mother died of Parkinson disease?

51
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:37,624
– My father 10 years ago primarily as a result of Parkinson’s disease.

52
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:42,252
– He had 2 heart attacks.
– He had 2 heart attacks before that.

53
00:08:42,504 --> 00:08:53,504
– Your health in good health?
– I have to spit 3 times don’t I? I’m in good health!

54
00:08:59,144 --> 00:09:13,224
– Grandmother; hernia, diverticulitis, polymyalgia and angina.

55
00:09:13,464 --> 00:09:24,492
Maternal; malaria, twice pneumonia, cholera, ischemic attack, bladder cancer.

56
00:09:24,984 --> 00:09:37,185
Your grandfather is still alive. And grandmother had heart problem.

57
00:09:37,704 --> 00:09:45,704
But you feel good?
– I do.

58
00:09:45,845 --> 00:09:54,614
– You do not visit ever any doctor?
– Until I got pregnant.

59
00:09:54,864 --> 00:10:04,342
– In childhood you said you had pneumonia?
– No, tonsillitis.

60
00:10:05,345 --> 00:10:10,742
– After that you never fell ill?
– No.

61
00:10:10,884 --> 00:10:15,244
– Is that true?
– Yes.

62
00:10:15,344 --> 00:10:19,624
– If Liz gets anything is always connected to throat.

63
00:10:20,144 --> 00:10:25,264
– A little bit, no heavy stuff that needs medication?

64
00:10:25,505 --> 00:10:30,625
– The only time where I had a really bad cough in me first relationship,

65
00:10:30,902 --> 00:10:39,094
he was a medical student and he worked in a tuberculosis ward and he gave me this awful cough

66
00:10:39,344 --> 00:10:46,384
and since then I‘ve since always had this mucus, cough.

67
00:10:46,902 --> 00:10:50,984
– Did you get any medication because of that?

68
00:10:51,054 --> 00:10:56,624
Were you tested for TB?
– No. No.

69
00:10:59,702 --> 00:11:06,002
– The child had a cranial osteopathy.
– Yes.

70
00:11:06,102 --> 00:11:12,184
They were going to suggest several operations, not yet but for a later date for the eyes.

71
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:16,812
– And normal dentition?
– Yes, teethed normally.

72
00:11:16,964 --> 00:11:19,777
– Fontanels closed?
– It closed late...

73
00:11:20,024 --> 00:11:30,017
- About 2 years old.
– She walks now? I see her she crawling.

74
00:11:30,264 --> 00:11:37,424
– She can walk.
– Can she run or is it a kind of ataxia?

75
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:42,994
– She can run.
– It rolls a little bit, like a sailor.

76
00:11:43,094 --> 00:11:47,904
This is what they are talking about when they are saying immature motor development.

77
00:11:48,424 --> 00:11:56,104
– Are you connected with sailing?
– No! I just sit down on the beach!

78
00:11:56,864 --> 00:12:05,117
– Speech slow. What can she do?

79
00:12:05,217 --> 00:12:11,344
– She can just say a few words now. Mommy and juice.

80
00:12:11,517 --> 00:12:15,948
But she cannot hold a conversation. She can understand.

81
00:12:16,224 --> 00:12:20,477
For a long time I felt she couldn’t understand and I do a lot of things for her

82
00:12:20,577 --> 00:12:23,784
but then she realized that mommy does everything for me,

83
00:12:24,054 --> 00:12:27,624
I’ll let her do everything for me and she does understand

84
00:12:27,794 --> 00:12:33,014
because now I realize I have to get her to talk to me more.

85
00:12:33,264 --> 00:12:44,784
– From my point of view her comprehension is quite good.

86
00:12:45,025 --> 00:12:52,882
She gets very frustrated because the speech that comes is babbled, it doesn’t make sense.

87
00:12:52,982 --> 00:12:56,460
– But if you tell her bring me this, she will.
– Yes.

88
00:12:56,704 --> 00:13:03,104
– All the time?
– If it suits her. She’s obstinate.

89
00:13:03,372 --> 00:13:09,260
She can do it when she feels like.
– She has a cough?

90
00:13:09,504 --> 00:13:17,264
– She started in nursery school last September and from then on it has been coughs and colds

91
00:13:17,537 --> 00:13:22,384
and the cough was quite bad about a month ago.

92
00:13:22,504 --> 00:13:25,164
She was coughing every time she had a cold drink.

93
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:27,584
– And she was vomiting?
– Yes.

94
00:13:27,824 --> 00:13:31,004
– Every time she coughed she vomited?

95
00:13:31,104 --> 00:13:39,254
– She vomited only after cold drinks or if she ran.

96
00:13:39,504 --> 00:13:42,454
– Will she vomit or cough and vomit?

97
00:13:42,704 --> 00:13:49,622
– Cough and vomit. Not all the ingested in the stomach. Just a bit.

98
00:13:53,185 --> 00:13:59,862
– She also had these 2 febrile convulsions.

99
00:14:00,104 --> 00:14:05,744
– The convulsion started when the fever was high?

100
00:14:06,744 --> 00:14:22,440
– The second one 39C, passing 39C.
- I don’t know about the first one.

101
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,904
– The second one was a lot more serious.

102
00:14:26,145 --> 00:14:38,645
– She was fitting for 3-4 hours even after she was at hospital.

103
00:14:38,745 --> 00:14:46,625
– They gave benzodiazepine.

104
00:15:00,214 --> 00:15:05,584
– They didn’t know the cause of the fever so they were always trying to find the cause of it.

105
00:15:06,102 --> 00:15:12,744
They injected her with antibiotics.

106
00:15:16,065 --> 00:15:25,302
– On May she received Nat-m., Phos. in June, October last year Carc.,

107
00:15:25,544 --> 00:15:37,584
December Bell., February Agar., again February Nat-m., May Sil. and April Tub.

108
00:15:40,904 --> 00:15:47,304
– Is she restless like she is now?
– Yes.

109
00:15:47,824 --> 00:15:52,694
– She has to be busy.
– What does she like to eat?

110
00:15:52,944 --> 00:16:10,864
– Everything. She loves salty things, crisps, chocolate, tomatoes, pasta.

111
00:16:11,005 --> 00:16:17,014
But she’ll eat anything. All the Greek food, all the fruits.

112
00:16:17,505 --> 00:16:23,024
– Did you breastfed her?
– Yes, for 7 months.

113
00:16:23,265 --> 00:16:28,494
– Then you stopped because?
– She was hungry.

114
00:16:31,464 --> 00:16:40,304
– She can get irritable if she doesn’t eat her food or sleep.

115
00:16:40,545 --> 00:16:42,614
– If she eats she feels better?

116
00:16:42,764 --> 00:16:49,624
– Yes. She loves chocolate but she’s not into sweets.

117
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:56,544
Only the chocolate. And she loves her milk.

118
00:16:57,057 --> 00:17:09,344
– Does she drink milk?
– Yes, she drinks a lot, very heavily. Large amounts.

119
00:17:10,104 --> 00:17:15,105
– Anything... Juice.
– But how much milk?

120
00:17:15,282 --> 00:17:21,682
– She likes the milk but I give her chocolate milk cause she prefers that.

121
00:17:21,782 --> 00:17:27,905
But she loves milk anyway. I don’t give her too much milk anyway.

122
00:17:28,944 --> 00:17:34,582
– Why?
– I just give her twice a day because...

123
00:17:38,145 --> 00:17:43,542
 - This is absolute frustration.

124
00:17:45,334 --> 00:17:50,184
– She does not like to be held?
– She does.

125
00:17:50,454 --> 00:17:52,404
– She looked affectionate when she came to me.

126
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:57,584
She embraced me. Is she like this with strangers?

127
00:17:57,857 --> 00:18:08,588
– Yes absolutely. Some people may think this familiarity is inappropriate for a child her age.

128
00:18:10,144 --> 00:18:23,084
– Have you seen any sexual irritation? Playing with her genitals?
– No.

129
00:18:23,184 --> 00:18:30,624
– The only time I’ve noticed it as if we are in the process to toilet train her,

130
00:18:30,864 --> 00:18:40,864
when she is sitting on the potty because there is noise happening there, but nothing special.

131
00:18:50,828 --> 00:18:55,200
– She likes to eat!

132
00:18:55,704 --> 00:19:05,697
– Have you found out that you can put a lot of salt and still will eat it?
– We haven’t tried that.

133
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:15,148
– She has the preference in the morning on her toast, she will have a salty yeast.

134
00:19:16,944 --> 00:19:30,508
– When she vomits she will vomit like rocket or not?
– I just comes.

135
00:19:30,684 --> 00:19:40,504
– Normal vomiting but in the febrile convulsion yes she vomited like that.

136
00:19:40,748 --> 00:19:50,744
– She was never a vomiting baby. It was only during the cough that she vomited.

137
00:19:50,988 --> 00:20:02,017
– Have you noticed is she likes to eat something sour? Like lemon?
– No.

138
00:20:02,164 --> 00:20:07,905
– She got a piece of lemon, we were in Skiathos for 2 weeks before we came here,

139
00:20:08,182 --> 00:20:13,944
she put in her mouth and spit it.
– The outside of the lemon?

140
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:42,892
– The inside. And she threw that away pretty quickly.
– She likes her sleep.

141
00:20:43,144 --> 00:20:49,292
– She sleeps a lot?
– She sleeps well at night.

142
00:21:11,544 --> 00:21:19,532
– The other thing she has done is really grinding her teeth in her sleep.

143
00:21:26,824 --> 00:21:37,185
– Does she eat fruits?
– Yes. She loves fruit.

144
00:21:37,378 --> 00:21:38,614
– What kind of fruits?

145
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:49,345
– Anything. She doesn’t really like oranges because the pulp is too fussy.

146
00:21:49,422 --> 00:21:56,748
– She sat with me on the beach yesterday and she ate a whole pear quite happily.

147
00:21:57,024 --> 00:22:05,984
She eats plums, apricots, peaches, apples, bananas. She loves fruits.

148
00:22:10,064 --> 00:22:16,464
What particularly annoyed us with the pediatrician,

149
00:22:16,737 --> 00:22:27,468
at the conclusion his words to us was there is nothing more that we can do medically.

150
00:22:28,257 --> 00:22:32,864
It’s educational problem go talk to the education people.

151
00:22:33,004 --> 00:22:39,504
And his final sentence, you should hear this I’ve lived with you for 10 years I feel I know you,

152
00:22:41,548 --> 00:22:53,068
was many people when they are told of this diagnosis go out and spend a lot of money on alternative ideas.

153
00:22:53,584 --> 00:22:58,700
He said it’s a waste of money. That was his final word.

154
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:03,108
– I’ll see him in September again.

155
00:23:03,284 --> 00:23:06,380
– Will you see him?
– Maybe.

156
00:23:06,624 --> 00:23:13,544
– See him in 2 years and bring him the child and ask him...

157
00:23:33,772 --> 00:23:45,784
I don’t really understand what has happened. And there is this misconception but...

158
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,864
– From a medical point of view?

159
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:56,544
– No, from homeopathic point of view, the way we look upon the cases.

160
00:23:59,864 --> 00:24:08,704
Can I ask you some more private questions? How was sex between you?

161
00:24:08,972 --> 00:24:16,384
Frequent, not frequent?
– In the first years frequent

162
00:24:16,652 --> 00:24:22,540
but then my husband had a lot of travelling so it was like ships in the night.

163
00:24:22,684 --> 00:24:44,704
– Not frequent.
– Do you know the day you had sex and she was born?

164
00:24:44,945 --> 00:24:51,128
– Because it was not frequent we can say even the minute it was!

165
00:25:00,577 --> 00:25:12,397
– Do you remember a special mood in which you were?
– Very romantic!

166
00:25:14,384 --> 00:25:23,404
– Was it more need for real sexual contact?

167
00:25:32,304 --> 00:25:38,704
– From you talk the other day can I remember when it was like when we conceived

168
00:25:38,977 --> 00:25:46,904
and I really cannot. Do you remember?

169
00:25:47,148 --> 00:25:50,497
– It was an afternoon; I was home from work and...

170
00:25:52,544 --> 00:25:57,857
I seem to remember it was quite good!

171
00:26:02,977 --> 00:26:18,144
– Do you remember if you were relaxed during the intercourse or tense because of any kind of anxiety?

172
00:26:18,384 --> 00:26:19,664
– No.

173
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:50,044
 – We had just discussed and accepted the children are not going to be part of our life.

174
00:26:50,144 --> 00:26:53,388
So we were both concentrating about building our career.

175
00:26:53,664 --> 00:27:00,824
We just accepted that children were not going to be our particular thing.

176
00:27:01,068 --> 00:27:08,924
And then out of the miracle she arrives. It is 100% natural.

177
00:27:09,024 --> 00:27:14,614
We took nothing, it just happened. It was fate.

178
00:27:14,864 --> 00:27:17,424
Who knows? I don’t know.

179
00:27:19,222 --> 00:27:26,384
There won’t be anymore, she is the only grandchild from either side of the family,

180
00:27:26,625 --> 00:27:31,254
I’m 51 this year, my wife hides her age very well

181
00:27:31,504 --> 00:27:39,944
and it is important that we give her the very best opportunity that we possibly can.

182
00:27:40,114 --> 00:27:45,584
Because when she gets to be in her 18s maybe we won’t be around for her.

183
00:27:45,825 --> 00:27:54,005
– What was the age that you became pregnant?
-41.

184
00:27:58,384 --> 00:28:09,904
– We’ll see what we can actually. That’s enough.
– Thank you!

185
00:28:10,934 --> 00:28:15,784
I just gave you an example of the research

186
00:28:15,954 --> 00:28:27,824
to see how difficult it is to get the real facts in such a research.

187
00:28:29,434 --> 00:28:40,374
Because this is usual, the memory is not so fresh and of course

188
00:28:40,624 --> 00:28:54,945
and many people will not be able to spot the time exactly that was conceived.

189
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:59,824
Why we have this problem?

190
00:29:01,345 --> 00:29:05,654
This problem is because I think of 2 reasons;

191
00:29:06,145 --> 00:29:26,902
one is some hereditary predisposition and there is also another factor which plays a role

192
00:29:27,044 --> 00:29:37,384
and which is well known in gynecology and pediatrics

193
00:29:37,554 --> 00:29:52,134
that the later a woman bears a child the more possibilities we have for some kind of defects.

194
00:29:58,664 --> 00:30:10,424
There are also a few things. The child is quite good-looking.

195
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:24,504
That means love was there but as said it is not the first year of love.

196
00:30:32,304 --> 00:30:40,652
Analyzing this situation we come to the conclusion

197
00:30:40,944 --> 00:30:50,792
that we have to treat something which comes as hereditary predisposition

198
00:30:50,892 --> 00:30:54,768
which comes as a combination of the parents,

199
00:30:54,944 --> 00:31:08,257
the ancestors and it is not going to be very easily and fast recovery.

200
00:31:11,824 --> 00:31:20,544
But I do believe that if this child gets correct homeopathic treatment

201
00:31:20,788 --> 00:31:34,968
can become a normal child by the age of 8-9.

202
00:31:35,277 --> 00:31:49,584
But she will need good homeopathic treatment.

203
00:31:53,597 --> 00:32:08,544
I would like to take this child 2-3 later to the pediatrician.

204
00:32:14,177 --> 00:32:21,584
Today you did a very beautiful job!

205
00:32:24,144 --> 00:32:31,997
I was surprised because I saw the remedy

206
00:32:32,097 --> 00:32:40,268
and I said to him at the moment, let me see, and the remedy was absolutely there

207
00:32:40,444 --> 00:32:50,017
but show them the symptoms on which this repertorization is based.

208
00:32:51,788 --> 00:33:00,504
She is affectionate, curious, kissing, restless, desires to wonder,

209
00:33:00,648 --> 00:33:11,777
strabismus, grinding teeth, vomiting on coughing, vomiting drinking cold water,

210
00:33:12,024 --> 00:33:20,984
tottering gait, intense fever, eating after ameliorates, fruit desire,

211
00:33:21,128 --> 00:33:49,144
milk desire, salt desire, gonorrhea suppressed? I didn’t hear that.

212
00:33:52,437 --> 00:34:21,388
Learning to walk late. Who thought of this remedy?

213
00:34:25,504 --> 00:34:35,744
– In the last semester of my pregnancy I could only have ice in my mouth

214
00:34:37,237 --> 00:34:58,294
– During pregnancy she had a keynote of Verat. Look at this.

215
00:34:58,544 --> 00:35:35,664
Desire for ice. Verat. people like to have ice cubes. She crunched them.

216
00:35:36,694 --> 00:35:42,744
– My husband it was a cheap way to keep me happy because I it was only ice.

217
00:35:45,304 --> 00:35:46,977
Because I didn’t crave anything else.

218
00:35:47,224 --> 00:35:55,148
– Unbelievable! You see this very interesting story.

219
00:35:55,664 --> 00:36:05,664
She was in a Verat. state and most probably the same remedy will do good to her.

220
00:36:05,912 --> 00:36:12,065
I don’t take your case; you’re not in the list!

221
00:36:15,905 --> 00:36:23,692
– I miss a little this late speaking of this child.

222
00:36:23,944 --> 00:36:32,140
It’s tendency of Tub. or Agar. better by eating which is very strong for me.

223
00:36:35,024 --> 00:36:38,744
4 years and not a sentence.

224
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:43,104
– But it is not just late speaking.

225
00:36:43,344 --> 00:36:57,697
It is mental aberration, problem. She had Agar. and Tub.

226
00:36:57,888 --> 00:37:01,584
– If the mother had become Verat. during pregnancy

227
00:37:01,857 --> 00:37:12,097
what do you think would have happened if it was given to her because of the desire for ice?

228
00:37:12,344 --> 00:37:19,264
– Then the child would have been born much healthier.

229
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:26,868
I may suggest because of that phenomenon that the child might have been born normal.

230
00:37:33,404 --> 00:37:47,212
– I would have 2 questions; one is how many U/S had the mother during pregnancy?

231
00:37:47,464 --> 00:37:54,892
– Mother, did you have any?

232
00:37:55,144 --> 00:38:11,382
– I had a very early one in 9 weeks, the nuchal scan developed by a Greek professor.

233
00:38:11,624 --> 00:38:22,024
– What’s his name?
–Nikolaides.

234
00:38:22,952 --> 00:38:26,188
– He developed a test?

235
00:38:26,464 --> 00:38:32,588
- Nuchal test. It’s a fold in the back of the neck.

236
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:43,864
– Explain to me what it is.
– To know if there is any problem with the child early on.

237
00:38:44,108 --> 00:38:56,144
– Do they take some fluid?
– No, just visually they measure it.

238
00:38:56,417 --> 00:39:04,864
– From the length of it they can decide whether you have a tendency to Down’s syndrome.

239
00:39:04,977 --> 00:39:09,824
– It’s specifically for Down’s syndrome. What did they tell you?

240
00:39:10,092 --> 00:39:19,414
– It was very good. I had the chance of a much younger woman having a normal child.

241
00:39:19,664 --> 00:39:23,254
– Fortunately it’s not a Down’s syndrome case.

242
00:39:23,404 --> 00:39:29,184
It’s a very interesting case that makes the prognosis even better

243
00:39:29,324 --> 00:39:40,428
because it gives up the confirmation that our decision is really correct

244
00:39:40,704 --> 00:39:43,777
and therefore makes the prognoses even better.

245
00:39:44,024 --> 00:39:50,944
Take her with you to the doctor in September!

246
00:39:51,184 --> 00:39:54,784
That is very important;

247
00:39:55,024 --> 00:40:07,824
you don’t have to have aberrations and symptoms on the mental or the emotional level necessarily.

248
00:40:08,097 --> 00:40:16,784
Symptoms can only be physical. The rest of the organism can be left intact.

249
00:40:17,057 --> 00:40:29,584
It’s such a misunderstanding because all this came from misunderstanding of my teaching.

250
00:40:29,847 --> 00:40:39,997
Where I first the essences some of my students thought George prescribes only on mental emotional picture.

251
00:40:40,097 --> 00:40:48,268
This is not true. And then I had to undo all this.

252
00:40:48,444 --> 00:40:53,288
And I said for God’s sake you always take the 3 levels

253
00:40:53,388 --> 00:41:00,184
but sometimes the problem will be mental only, emotional only or physical only.

254
00:41:00,435 --> 00:41:04,784
Or it may be spread in all 3 levels as well.

255
00:41:05,057 --> 00:41:21,264
Don’t focus yourself to the idea that you will have to find a mental picture of Nux-v. or Lyc. or Phos.

256
00:41:21,505 --> 00:41:38,045
You can get Phos. who will be not at all this social and who can be contacted easily.

257
00:41:38,145 --> 00:41:48,662
The same way that you will get a Plat. who will not be interested in sexual act.

258
00:41:48,904 --> 00:41:58,625
You may ask a Plat. how is your sexuality and she says it doesn’t exist or it’s normal.

259
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:14,584
It doesn’t have to have the picture to have all the symptoms of all levels

260
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:25,100
because if you try to find that you will be misled to phantasy.

261
00:42:25,244 --> 00:42:29,504
You will leave facts and you are going to phantasy projecting;

262
00:42:29,772 --> 00:42:40,464
he is afraid to give a lecture in public, why, but I have never given a lecture I don’t know.

263
00:42:40,737 --> 00:42:43,344
No you are afraid to give a lecture

264
00:42:43,617 --> 00:42:51,297
and you project some reason why he is afraid to give a lecture in public.

265
00:42:53,068 --> 00:42:58,188
Because you want you want to make a mental picture of Lyc.

266
00:42:58,464 --> 00:43:02,024
where they are afraid to give a public lecture.

267
00:43:02,164 --> 00:43:08,424
Then you conjecture, you use your phantasy.

268
00:43:08,664 --> 00:43:14,304
That’s not correct and you have to be very careful about that.

269
00:43:17,384 --> 00:43:27,372
The greatest calamity for Homeopathy are this misunderstandings.

270
00:43:27,624 --> 00:43:35,104
The way I have shown in all my classes I take into consideration the facts

271
00:43:35,204 --> 00:43:40,024
and I put together the real information.

272
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:46,184
I remember here one of the time I had collected all the teachers.

273
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:53,014
You come and we discuss. Somebody presented a case, another presented a case.

274
00:43:53,264 --> 00:44:03,254
There was a case of great claustrophobia. Different remedies were suggested.

275
00:44:03,404 --> 00:44:09,284
One of the teacher gets up and says this is case of Arn.

276
00:44:09,384 --> 00:44:13,224
Why Arn.? We don’t have any symptoms of it.

277
00:44:13,494 --> 00:44:19,664
He says what I think has happened to this person is that

278
00:44:19,837 --> 00:44:30,454
in his previous life he was a victim of an earthquake so the building fell

279
00:44:30,704 --> 00:44:39,414
and hit her and bruised her and at the same time she was feeling claustrophobic.

280
00:44:39,664 --> 00:44:49,142
In an earthquake, in a previous life she was claustrophobic and she was born and now we have to give Arn.

281
00:44:53,494 --> 00:45:03,784
This is projection. Any remedy can be justified through these projections.

282
00:45:06,605 --> 00:45:12,502
They tell me a patient was sitting there...

283
00:45:13,014 --> 00:45:24,264
- He was clairvoyant. It was not a delusion.

284
00:45:24,534 --> 00:45:28,104
– He did not claim to be clairvoyant

285
00:45:28,224 --> 00:45:34,504
because we asked him some more questions to which he didn’t answer correctly.

286
00:45:34,774 --> 00:45:41,504
Clairvoyance has no place in science.

287
00:45:44,502 --> 00:45:55,745
Somebody was sitting there and he put a question and the patient goes like this.

288
00:45:56,022 --> 00:46:12,144
You look? This is Staph.! Why Staph.? Because he closed up.

289
00:46:12,385 --> 00:46:15,734
That kind of projection I mean.

290
00:46:16,502 --> 00:46:24,694
You have to be very careful of people telling you such kind of things.

291
00:46:27,745 --> 00:46:34,422
The result tells you. Do you have result and what kind of result?

292
00:46:34,664 --> 00:46:38,774
Everybody in Homeopathy claims to have results.
