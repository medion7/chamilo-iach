1
00:00:17,057 --> 00:00:26,208
This is an 11 year-old child with an iridocyclitis which destroyed almost completely the left eye.

2
00:00:26,384 --> 00:00:41,424
She still has maybe 5% of her vision and the problem is now to save the rest vision

3
00:00:41,697 --> 00:00:47,500
and to protect the right eye.
–When was the last eye examination done?

4
00:00:47,744 --> 00:00:54,904
– It was done a few months ago and they said that 95% of the nerve is destroyed.

5
00:00:55,216 --> 00:00:58,785
– What about the right eye?
– The right eye is in order.

6
00:00:59,304 --> 00:01:04,694
Nothing’s wrong with the right eye. Can I give her history?

7
00:01:04,944 --> 00:01:12,104
When the child was 9 month old she had an otitis for the first time which was treated with antibiotics.

8
00:01:12,374 --> 00:01:19,542
Then she had 5-6 times otitis which were treated 4 times with antibiotics.

9
00:01:19,784 --> 00:01:28,504
Three quarters of each year she had eczema in the right wrist and on the elbow

10
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,340
which was treated with cortisone.

11
00:01:31,584 --> 00:01:37,224
When she was 2 year and 3 months old arthritis of the left knee started.

12
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:49,744
First was treated with anti-inflammatory medicines and laser and when this didn’t help she had steroids,

13
00:01:50,062 --> 00:01:54,664
she put them on the knee and the inflammation stopped.

14
00:01:55,105 --> 00:02:03,664
– What year was that?
– When she 2 and 3 months old, she was born in 1990 so this was 1992.

15
00:02:03,937 --> 00:02:07,264
Very shortly after this, 3 months later,

16
00:02:07,777 --> 00:02:13,144
a certain skin disease started which is called morphea,

17
00:02:13,388 --> 00:02:24,144
it’s a benign subgroup of scleroderma it started on the thorax and it was also treated with cortisone.

18
00:02:24,417 --> 00:02:32,012
So since she was 5,5 years old the situation is stable on the skin,

19
00:02:32,264 --> 00:02:37,384
it has not changed but it was also treated suppressively.

20
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:40,588
Then, shortly after the treatment of the knee...

21
00:02:40,864 --> 00:02:51,864
- What age was the skin condition?
-2 years.

22
00:02:58,188 --> 00:03:07,424
– We were not sure when it began because in the beginning it was very small.

23
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:14,584
– So they cannot say when it really started. But it was treated after the knee.

24
00:03:19,457 --> 00:03:26,624
And then shortly after the knee treatment the difficulties with the eye started.

25
00:03:26,864 --> 00:03:33,537
And when the child was 3 Quarters an iridocyclitis was diagnosed.

26
00:03:33,784 --> 00:03:45,057
ANA was positive 1:160 and eyes were immediately treated locally with cortisone.

27
00:03:45,304 --> 00:03:51,948
There were constantly some small inflammations of the eye and 2-3 times severe.

28
00:03:52,224 --> 00:03:57,857
Constantly cortisone drops were used.

29
00:03:59,137 --> 00:04:21,464
In February 1998 a severe damage of the vision was noticed, behind the retina.

30
00:04:23,384 --> 00:04:30,544
She got 2 depos one in July and one in October of 1998

31
00:04:30,817 --> 00:04:36,944
and she was treated 4 weeks with 60 mg of cortisone a day.

32
00:04:37,217 --> 00:04:42,337
And under the treatment with cortisone the child develop migraines,

33
00:04:42,584 --> 00:04:50,508
left side with pressing or stitching pain and woke up with pain in the morning,

34
00:04:50,784 --> 00:04:54,864
sometimes with vomiting which ameliorated the pain.

35
00:04:55,137 --> 00:05:02,028
She had checks 5 times a week and then her internal cortisone stopped and it has subsided.

36
00:05:02,304 --> 00:05:15,617
In 1998 she developed warts on the soles of her feet and a neighbor treated her with Thuja

37
00:05:15,864 --> 00:05:20,464
and the warts vanished and did not come back.

38
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:37,868
The child came to me for treatment in 1999 with the wish to stop this process in the body.

39
00:05:38,144 --> 00:05:47,617
I did not succeed very well I must say. The child is self-developed quite well but...

40
00:05:47,864 --> 00:05:50,944
- What remedies have you prescribed?

41
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,017
– Shall I say some of the symptoms she had?

42
00:05:54,264 --> 00:05:58,104
– Beside the history of the disease the mother related the following things;

43
00:05:58,348 --> 00:06:04,504
she never had acutes, if she ever caught a cold the symptoms vanished very fast.

44
00:06:04,748 --> 00:06:09,868
Then she is a very warm child, sticks feet out of bed,

45
00:06:10,144 --> 00:06:18,584
doesn’t want attraction, sleeps on abdomen, feels much better in the seaside,

46
00:06:18,828 --> 00:06:24,984
likes to take pieces of ice into her mouth, has quite some fears of darkness,

47
00:06:25,228 --> 00:06:29,584
being alone, war, nature catastrophes, high places, injections,

48
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:34,977
bites nails unintentionally, likes to eat smoked meat,

49
00:06:35,224 --> 00:06:41,105
sausages and bacon but cuts away fat from meat, desires ice cream and noodles.

50
00:06:41,377 --> 00:06:51,764
– Wait. Say it again so he can put some symptoms.

51
00:06:51,864 --> 00:07:02,544
- Feels much better in the seaside, likes to take pieces of ice into her mouth,

52
00:07:02,821 --> 00:07:15,254
fear of darkness 3 times, fear of being alone 3 times and the other fears were not so intense,

53
00:07:15,254 --> 00:07:25,744
war and nature catastrophes 1 time, high places and injections.

54
00:07:26,504 --> 00:07:34,184
Nail biting, desires smoked meat...

55
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:52,145
She had extremely red cheeks from birth and on.

56
00:07:52,436 --> 00:07:58,824
It’s a pity we don’t have a photo, it was like a cherry.

57
00:07:59,094 --> 00:08:05,264
– Why not now?
– Because of the treatment it’s gone. The whole child changed!

58
00:08:10,504 --> 00:08:15,464
Then she is very sympathetic especially in the social sector,

59
00:08:15,734 --> 00:08:26,572
nausea after chocolate, sensitive to bad smells, loves cats and dogs very much,

60
00:08:26,824 --> 00:08:36,544
has tendency to develop blue marks on the skin when she hurts herself.

61
00:08:37,644 --> 00:08:39,824
This is also gone.

62
00:08:40,097 --> 00:08:49,782
– How are here platelets? Are they low?
– They were always normal.

63
00:08:53,104 --> 00:08:59,504
– Liver no problem after cortisone?
– No.

64
00:08:59,745 --> 00:09:04,984
– She’s a very easy going child, always happy, likes to eat,

65
00:09:05,228 --> 00:09:09,468
takes a good breakfast, goes to school, comes to home, never tired.

66
00:09:12,948 --> 00:09:20,124
Always does what is expected from her, never complains.

67
00:09:20,224 --> 00:09:25,424
Because of the arthritis of her left knee and some of the symptoms I gave Med.

68
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:30,934
That was the first 30C.
 – What was the reaction?

69
00:09:31,184 --> 00:09:35,024
– She took it for 5 weeks. 2 times a week I gave it to her.

70
00:09:35,265 --> 00:09:47,574
She developed an acute with 38C fever and during the time she took it she was very obstinate.

71
00:09:47,824 --> 00:09:56,534
But the time without remedy this subsided and she was the old compromising self again.

72
00:09:56,784 --> 00:10:03,944
And the eye remained stable which means the pressure was quite normal.

73
00:10:04,214 --> 00:10:10,002
I think 17 or 16.

74
00:10:10,102 --> 00:10:17,014
And there were no other changes so I did not think this remedy was very helpful

75
00:10:17,264 --> 00:10:21,345
and since she had a very significant desire for smoked meat

76
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:33,664
and because of the great sympathy on the social sector and the early suppression of the eczema

77
00:10:34,184 --> 00:10:45,452
I gave her Caust. in different potencies up to 1M.

78
00:10:45,704 --> 00:10:49,292
And then the follow up 3 months later...

79
00:10:50,304 --> 00:10:59,020
- What was the result of Caust.?
– 2 old symptoms came back for short time.

80
00:10:59,264 --> 00:11:05,932
Pain in the left Achilles tendon on walking and stomach pain when the stomach was empty.

81
00:11:06,184 --> 00:11:09,772
These were old symptoms and they came back.

82
00:11:10,024 --> 00:11:13,612
– The pain in the knee?
– Nothing.

83
00:11:13,864 --> 00:11:16,464
– Neither the skin?
– Neither the skin.

84
00:11:22,304 --> 00:11:26,664
I did not know that she already had Thuja, I found out this later.

85
00:11:26,904 --> 00:11:32,544
Then she developed a very strange sweat and then mother said

86
00:11:32,812 --> 00:11:40,224
that she always had this sweat and the smell was like an old cellar.

87
00:11:44,824 --> 00:11:53,444
After Caust. the girl had more desire for ice cream and chocolate and aversion to fat and vegetable,

88
00:11:53,544 --> 00:11:58,412
more fear to be alone, to go to the dark cellar and for the relatives.

89
00:11:58,686 --> 00:12:10,704
The fears got even worse after Caust. So, because of the strange smell I gave her Thuja 200C and it...

90
00:12:10,977 --> 00:12:21,217
- Does Thuja have this smell?
– Yes, moldy.

91
00:12:21,464 --> 00:12:33,917
– I always decided the treatment after the eye doctor who primarily prescribed cortisone

92
00:12:34,017 --> 00:12:42,224
and eye drops for the pressure.

93
00:12:49,654 --> 00:12:55,265
She gets 3 different drops;

94
00:12:55,542 --> 00:13:00,385
against inflammation, to open the retina and to put down the pressure.

95
00:13:02,225 --> 00:13:05,057
– She still takes this?
–Yes.

96
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:15,062
So, Thuja brought back the otitis and stopped the nail biting and stopped the desire for sweets.

97
00:13:15,304 --> 00:13:20,424
The eye pressure was still high and the parents wanted a remedy

98
00:13:20,694 --> 00:13:28,064
and because of she being like a grown-up,

99
00:13:28,332 --> 00:13:34,984
very adjusted and very much compassionate with animals I gave her Carc.

100
00:13:35,224 --> 00:13:40,864
The follow up 3 months later, girls seemed to develop more self-confidence,

101
00:13:41,132 --> 00:13:45,984
was not so yielding anymore and since there was not effect on the eye

102
00:13:46,252 --> 00:13:54,464
I repeated Carc. in higher potency 1M and this was probably wrong

103
00:13:54,977 --> 00:14:00,097
because after this the eye pressure went up very much.

104
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:09,824
What is so difficult in this case is that I cannot check on the eye

105
00:14:10,064 --> 00:14:15,457
because it is always treated with allopathic treatment so I really got afraid

106
00:14:15,704 --> 00:14:19,297
because suddenly they said now there’s glaucoma,

107
00:14:19,544 --> 00:14:25,697
the eye pressure was very high and the pain in the Achilles tendon much worse.

108
00:14:25,944 --> 00:14:34,264
– The pressure of the eye is a latter finding? How was it before the treatment?

109
00:14:34,508 --> 00:14:39,284
– The eye pressure started when she was treated with cortisone orally,

110
00:14:39,384 --> 00:14:46,546
before it was normal and when the oral cortisone started then the pressure went up.

111
00:14:46,817 --> 00:14:54,184
And the highest pressure was 42 I think.

112
00:14:54,922 --> 00:15:01,934
But when I saw her the pressure was 17.

113
00:15:02,184 --> 00:15:10,582
And then because she was very warm again and stick the feet out of bed I thought Carc. was probably wrong,

114
00:15:10,824 --> 00:15:19,024
I started with Sulph. 1Q but I didn’t see any effect.

115
00:15:19,265 --> 00:15:25,782
In the meantime she was operated on the eye with laser

116
00:15:46,384 --> 00:15:52,808
so the pressure wouldn’t go higher because of the glaucoma.

117
00:15:52,908 --> 00:16:05,464
Then after this operation, it was 16 and this was in September last year.

118
00:16:06,134 --> 00:16:14,524
And the symptoms were now in the Achilles tendon.

119
00:16:14,668 --> 00:16:22,865
– Did you put red cheeks as a symptom?

120
00:16:23,137 --> 00:16:29,264
– In September her fears were really very much reduced.

121
00:16:29,537 --> 00:16:32,588
Only fear in the dark when she is alone, no more nail biting,

122
00:16:32,864 --> 00:16:39,777
more self-confidence and I did not see a remedy so I thought,

123
00:16:40,024 --> 00:16:50,508
well this nerve is destructed in the eye and I gave her Phos. in low doses only because of the nerve.

124
00:16:50,784 --> 00:16:57,944
Under Phos. she developed a severe cough.

125
00:17:00,424 --> 00:17:10,664
I gave is 30C twice a week and then when they stopped the Phos. the cough also stopped

126
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:19,104
and now the last I did because I really don’t know any more what she really needs was Ferr-p.

127
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:26,621
After it the eye is stable and we don’t have any more troubles with the eye

128
00:17:26,844 --> 00:17:30,444
but I know it’s not a deep prescription.

129
00:17:30,544 --> 00:17:37,462
I don’t see the remedy she really needs. I hope you do!

130
00:17:39,504 --> 00:17:46,904
– You said she was a warm child. Is she still?
– She still is.

131
00:17:47,148 --> 00:17:56,124
– She likes open air?
– She likes swimming in cool water.

132
00:17:56,297 --> 00:18:10,704
– She has a shower with cold water?
– Showers not but in the sea she enjoys cold water.

133
00:18:10,977 --> 00:18:19,020
– Do you understand English?
– No.

134
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:24,824
– Can you describe her character for us?

135
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:30,984
– She is a very pleasant child, very easy to handle, very obedient.

136
00:18:31,224 --> 00:18:40,184
– If you tell her something will she do it?
– Mostly she does.

137
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:44,300
– Is she going to the school?
– Yes.

138
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:53,024
– Is she a good/medium student?
– In Mathematics she is medium and in language she is good.

139
00:18:53,265 --> 00:19:00,214
– She has a lot of friends?
– Yes.

140
00:19:00,464 --> 00:19:06,344
– She is a social child?
– Yes, very social.

141
00:19:08,294 --> 00:19:16,065
– Is it really that she doesn’t bite her nails anymore?

142
00:19:16,342 --> 00:19:20,424
– Is it true?
– She stopped.

143
00:19:20,722 --> 00:19:29,184
– With what remedy did she stop biting her nails?
– After Thuja.

144
00:19:31,984 --> 00:19:46,065
– She still likes smoked meat?
– She like it but not very much.

145
00:19:46,337 --> 00:19:48,897
– No craving.

146
00:19:49,144 --> 00:20:01,697
– What about bread?
– Yes. But she doesn’t desire noodles anymore.

147
00:20:02,977 --> 00:20:08,588
– Fat?
– No.

148
00:20:09,868 --> 00:20:20,577
– Is she sleeping ok without nightmares?
– Yes. She sleeps very well.

149
00:20:21,584 --> 00:20:29,265
– She still likes to put ice in her mouth?
– She likes.

150
00:20:29,537 --> 00:20:35,424
– And she likes to have cold drinks?

151
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:44,108
– She would drink it from the refrigerator but she doesn’t get it.

152
00:20:44,620 --> 00:21:03,544
– Can she eat warm and cold food as well? She prefers cold or warm food?

153
00:21:06,104 --> 00:21:17,132
– It depends on the food.
– But she is fighting now with her sister.

154
00:21:17,384 --> 00:21:19,844
Before she never fought with her.

155
00:21:19,944 --> 00:21:24,620
She also doesn’t accept if somebody hurts her in school, she fights back.

156
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:33,824
– Do you know if she grinds her teeth during sleep?
– She doesn’t.

157
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:40,480
– Does she ever use to come to your bed when she was sleeping in her room?

158
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:48,172
– No. Just when she was a little girl but then no.

159
00:21:48,424 --> 00:21:53,024
– How much water does she drink?
– Normal.

160
00:21:55,254 --> 00:21:59,862
– She likes fruits?
–Yes, she likes.

161
00:22:00,104 --> 00:22:11,894
- What she likes best?
– Strawberries, nectarines and peaches. They have to be ripe.

162
00:22:12,362 --> 00:22:18,764
– Oranges?
– She likes.

163
00:22:18,864 --> 00:22:24,504
– Does she sing?
– Yes.

164
00:22:27,064 --> 00:22:35,144
– Does she dance?
– She loves dancing.

165
00:22:44,344 --> 00:22:53,580
– Is she sensitive when you reprimand her? When you make a remark how will she react?

166
00:22:53,824 --> 00:22:58,424
– If she did something she puts her hands down.

167
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:04,864
– Does she cry?
– Seldom.

168
00:23:05,104 --> 00:23:12,024
– She has pain in the Achilles tendon when she’s walking.

169
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:21,504
Still has it sometimes when she’s running walking for a long time.

170
00:23:21,744 --> 00:23:27,385
– Is she having chewing gum now?
– Yes.

171
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:40,705
– Do you know if there is saliva running in the pillow in sleep?
– Yes, sometimes.

172
00:23:41,665 --> 00:23:53,185
– Does she have aversion eating from a place she thinks it’s not clean?

173
00:23:53,462 --> 00:24:03,425
– If an apple has a brown piece, she says I must cut it out.

174
00:24:03,702 --> 00:24:15,734
Doesn’t like drinking from a glass when another person has drunk.
– Let’s go inside.

175
00:24:17,524 --> 00:24:24,304
Everybody say “kalimera”! The class is quite heavy.

176
00:24:24,545 --> 00:24:29,104
What happened? You don’t see the remedy?

177
00:24:29,204 --> 00:24:42,060
You cannot find the remedy. Depression of homeopaths!

178
00:24:51,020 --> 00:25:01,784
We have to go fast I will not discuss so much with the class but you ask question of course.

179
00:25:02,028 --> 00:25:12,544
I will make the analysis of the case and the first thing we have to understand is

180
00:25:12,784 --> 00:25:16,008
why this girl is in that condition.

181
00:25:16,108 --> 00:25:28,694
This girl is in the condition because genetically she brings along disease which is quite serious.

182
00:25:39,425 --> 00:25:44,722
I don’t know how much treatable it is with Homeopathy.

183
00:25:44,822 --> 00:25:48,544
Scleroderma we have some effect,

184
00:25:48,812 --> 00:25:59,820
no cure of such cases but in this case due to the fact that cortisone has been given

185
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:13,504
and repeated doses of it we have a transference of the disease from the skin to the joints.

186
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:21,704
Because it was given repeatedly cortisone so the disease was not allowed to stay in that level,

187
00:26:21,944 --> 00:26:28,620
the disease moved into much more important organ and destroyed it.

188
00:26:28,864 --> 00:26:32,972
There are 2 questions for the homeopath? Can you cure such case?

189
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:41,554
If somebody comes to you and he has interest if my child will see again the answer is absolutely no.

190
00:26:41,654 --> 00:26:49,584
We can do nothing about the eye. The eye is finished.

191
00:26:49,825 --> 00:27:00,854
Can you do something else? What can we do?

192
00:27:01,864 --> 00:27:06,237
Not to progress, that’s one.

193
00:27:06,337 --> 00:27:12,764
Definitely the disease is going to progress and it’s going to progress on the eye level

194
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:18,988
because the organism seems to have a sensitivity,

195
00:27:19,264 --> 00:27:23,745
a weakness on this level so the disease will stay there.

196
00:27:24,022 --> 00:27:36,304
Most probably the prognosis of the case is quite bad especially for the other eye.

197
00:27:41,537 --> 00:27:51,924
What can we do? A patient comes to you in that state and you will say what?

198
00:27:52,024 --> 00:27:55,382
First of all you cannot do anything for the eye,

199
00:27:55,641 --> 00:28:00,694
what you can do maybe we can try to stop the progress of the disease.

200
00:28:00,944 --> 00:28:07,862
Maybe. Why maybe? Because of several factors.

201
00:28:08,374 --> 00:28:14,774
We have here a quite deep disorder we don't know how to handle it

202
00:28:15,024 --> 00:28:26,544
and we have to handle it as I said to you from the beginning absolutely correctly from the beginning

203
00:28:27,024 --> 00:28:40,604
and in order to have a really curative effect not just patching up things.

204
00:28:40,704 --> 00:28:46,048
You have to give the first correct remedy, the second correct, the third correct, the forth correct,

205
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:56,984
the child will need a series of remedies within a treatment 3 years to do what?

206
00:28:57,232 --> 00:29:05,697
Here is what we argue; Homeopathy is not a placebo story.

207
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:15,148
The first that will show you whether the remedy has acted or not, the stoppage of the progress,

208
00:29:15,424 --> 00:29:28,984
is to bring back the inflammation on the knee that will be at least as bad as it originally was.

209
00:29:29,228 --> 00:29:41,024
That will show you that the treatment is correct and if you treat further correctly the child

210
00:29:41,264 --> 00:29:48,944
then you have to bring back the original skin condition.

211
00:29:49,217 --> 00:29:54,584
That is the only way that you can know that your treatment is successful,

212
00:29:54,828 --> 00:30:02,017
everything else is placebo effect or similar to it.

213
00:30:02,264 --> 00:30:11,468
Don’t delude yourself that you are doing Homeopathy when somebody comes and says I feel better...

214
00:30:11,744 --> 00:30:19,425
We have a story and the story has to go backwards in the order in which it came.

215
00:30:21,464 --> 00:30:32,937
We go back to the treatment. [doctor’s name] is a good prescriber

216
00:30:34,264 --> 00:30:43,504
but we have to see critically upon the treatment.

217
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:52,214
Was the treatment successful? She herself said no.

218
00:30:52,464 --> 00:30:59,382
But now you know what is the problem? Because there are some changes.

219
00:30:59,894 --> 00:31:05,264
What we have to do now is start the treatment.

220
00:31:05,526 --> 00:31:20,624
That means if we want to have an effect we have to give the first remedy that was indicated but never given.

221
00:31:20,865 --> 00:31:32,428
And most probably, some of the remedies which she gave would be again indicated in a latter phase.

222
00:31:37,304 --> 00:31:51,384
Why these case are difficult? Because we have here the uppermost remedy with the symptoms.

223
00:31:52,664 --> 00:31:57,024
Which is whatever, Sep.

224
00:31:57,264 --> 00:32:08,957
And then you have an underlying layer which from time to time brings out some of its symptoms.

225
00:32:09,057 --> 00:32:18,508
The second layer which is Nat-m. And then you have another layer.

226
00:32:20,868 --> 00:32:30,454
Even the third layer can give out when you take up the case new symptoms.

227
00:32:30,945 --> 00:32:35,824
You take all these symptoms which belong not only to the uppermost

228
00:32:36,065 --> 00:32:40,424
but even to the second or to the third layer.

229
00:32:40,694 --> 00:32:48,104
That’s why the uppermost case will look confused.

230
00:32:48,502 --> 00:33:01,714
And you as a homeopath have to be able to see what is the real uppermost layer to prescribe first.

231
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:09,704
Like in her case the first layer has to be this layer.

232
00:33:09,944 --> 00:33:22,252
If wrong treatment is given it will suppress and sometimes it will disappear totally this

233
00:33:22,504 --> 00:33:26,760
and you will be not able to find anymore the remedy.

234
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:45,142
The reason is that Homeopathy as she did took away the warts.

235
00:33:45,384 --> 00:33:57,942
Thuja was giving up some symptoms. You gave Thuja and you took out the warts.

236
00:33:58,184 --> 00:34:01,684
But taking out the warts means nothing.

237
00:34:03,288 --> 00:34:16,097
Biting of nails disappeared but it did on the expense of the rest of the organism.

238
00:34:16,344 --> 00:34:23,824
When you try suppress the organism it doesn’t stay unmovable.

239
00:34:24,097 --> 00:34:31,504
It’s not something steady. It tries to rebalance.

240
00:34:31,777 --> 00:34:39,704
That means in trying to rebalance itself it will create a new picture that will be more confusing.

241
00:34:39,948 --> 00:34:42,465
There you cannot see the remedy anymore.

242
00:34:42,742 --> 00:34:52,214
That’s why prescribing superficially is very dangerous, not to the patient as side effect,

243
00:34:52,464 --> 00:34:59,624
it’s very dangerous because you are going to confuse the case more and more

244
00:34:59,894 --> 00:35:06,544
and finally when it comes to the real homeopath he has a big problem.

245
00:35:06,785 --> 00:35:12,424
I prefer to treat cases treated only allopathically with heavy medication

246
00:35:13,094 --> 00:35:23,297
than with homeopathic remedies one on the top of the other. It’s very dangerous.

247
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:34,304
I’m warning you because you may be thinking Homeopathy is doesn’t do any harm.

248
00:35:34,544 --> 00:35:50,668
Take this or that. Youla told me one of the goats hit her here.

249
00:35:52,037 --> 00:36:11,148
She has goats. Do I give Arn.? Why should you give Arn.?

250
00:36:12,428 --> 00:36:15,504
If it is a little pain it will go away by itself.

251
00:36:15,777 --> 00:36:20,384
Giving Arn. is speeding up perhaps.

252
00:36:20,897 --> 00:36:24,464
But at the same time you don’t know what it is doing on the organism.

253
00:36:24,737 --> 00:36:28,424
That’s why you have to be very careful to what you prescribe.

254
00:36:28,664 --> 00:36:41,984
Even the least acute remedy. Because there are things that don’t need to be prescribed upon.

255
00:36:42,252 --> 00:36:51,464
Of course if here in our case we have another 4 remedy Med.,

256
00:36:51,704 --> 00:37:02,984
even it can come up like this and is better in the sea. Has warts,

257
00:37:03,224 --> 00:37:09,624
better in the sea, sleeps on abdomen. You make a Med. case.

258
00:37:10,904 --> 00:37:15,684
You can make a Med. case. Is this a Med. case?

259
00:37:15,784 --> 00:37:23,512
It is a Med. case after Sep., Nat-m. and Thuja.

260
00:37:24,744 --> 00:37:35,224
That is the real knowledge and the real art of Homeopathy.

261
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:43,180
After this lecture, Mr. Vithoulkas has told us what is the first remedy.

262
00:37:43,424 --> 00:37:50,092
Say to us how we should have started in this case?

263
00:37:51,372 --> 00:37:58,104
Give me the symptoms that you put in the repertory.

264
00:37:58,624 --> 00:38:05,452
Nails, fear of being alone, of the dark, disaster, obstinate,

265
00:38:05,665 --> 00:38:10,024
sensitive to odors, sympathetic, glaucoma, inflammation...

266
00:38:10,294 --> 00:38:25,944
She is not obstinate. Take it out. The knee, warts, perspiration...

267
00:38:29,537 --> 00:38:41,304
Salivation in the night, refreshing things desire, juicy things desire combined,

268
00:38:41,824 --> 00:38:58,188
cold drink, cold water desire, fat aversion. Sensation of heat, ice desire.

269
00:39:13,057 --> 00:39:20,464
He has made what we can call a bad repertorization.

270
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:26,864
As you know I never interfere with repertorization except of one time saying put that symptom.

271
00:39:27,037 --> 00:39:28,808
Otherwise I don’t interfere.

272
00:39:28,984 --> 00:39:34,784
This is a bad repertorization because he has put all the symptoms that were originally there

273
00:39:34,924 --> 00:39:37,825
and symptoms that developed after the remedies.

274
00:39:46,024 --> 00:40:06,424
But looking at the case recapitulating the whole case...

275
00:40:07,948 --> 00:40:17,424
We have a patient here and we try to find the remedy that fits best for that child.

276
00:40:17,944 --> 00:40:23,484
And we have a child who has some fears; fear of being alone, fear of the dark etc.

277
00:40:23,584 --> 00:40:31,064
and who is a very nice child according to the description, not headstrong,

278
00:40:31,308 --> 00:40:43,617
nice, sweet, obedient child who is hot and who desires cold things.

279
00:40:45,664 --> 00:41:04,644
For any homeopath who knows a little bit of M.M. this brings you to one remedy. Puls.

280
00:41:12,044 --> 00:41:24,064
A sweet child, an easy going child, who is hot, desires fresh air, doesn’t like fat, has fears...

281
00:41:29,304 --> 00:41:42,624
- I was naturally thinking of Puls. but she never cries!
– Very good!  Do all Puls. cry?

282
00:41:42,864 --> 00:41:48,504
– I think so.
– I’ve told you so many times!

283
00:41:49,264 --> 00:42:05,904
Puls. many times cry but I have said I gave you the example of this woman from India,

284
00:42:06,177 --> 00:42:21,784
the minister of textiles, she was controlling all the exports of textiles of India.

285
00:42:22,028 --> 00:42:30,744
A woman like a man. Did you ever cry, I asked her? Never in my life.

286
00:42:30,988 --> 00:42:33,548
I say this example many times...

287
00:42:33,824 --> 00:42:40,464
Now, you have all the picture of Puls. fortunately for the class

288
00:42:40,737 --> 00:42:53,064
because if she was crying everybody would say Puls. I was hesitating to ask the question.

289
00:42:53,304 --> 00:43:00,984
I asked it in the end. And when I got negative answer I said nobody would think of Puls.

290
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:16,120
But you have to understand that the remedy for this case should have been Puls.

291
00:43:18,784 --> 00:43:33,624
Show me the result of the computer with all this bad repertorization.

292
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:53,344
Even a bad repertorization, putting everything inside, I can make Puls. without any doubt.

293
00:43:53,612 --> 00:44:20,300
Just put aversion fat instead of one, three times. And put disgust 3 times.

294
00:44:20,812 --> 00:44:31,544
raise the intensity of the disgust and the aversion to fat and see what happens.

295
00:44:38,594 --> 00:44:45,424
Only Puls. Don’t even consider another possibility.

296
00:44:46,764 --> 00:44:58,584
It doesn’t give you a second possibility at all. That means there is no other possibility.

297
00:44:59,617 --> 00:45:08,812
– Puls. has this craving for bacon but she cuts away the fat.?
– I don’t know.

298
00:45:10,344 --> 00:45:14,424
– I ask if you ever saw it.

299
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:25,684
– I don’t know but you have given Caust. Caust. may be the fifth remedy.

300
00:45:26,984 --> 00:45:40,824
What I say is that the totality shows that Puls. should have been given as a first remedy.

301
00:45:42,104 --> 00:45:52,904
Don’t take into consideration negative symptoms. You thought of Puls.

302
00:45:53,004 --> 00:45:56,744
Every homeopath should have thought of Puls.

303
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:04,104
If you do think of Puls. go back and study, don’t practice!

304
00:46:15,192 --> 00:46:24,624
– I think there is a very typical misunderstanding not to consider Puls. in such case.

305
00:46:25,744 --> 00:46:35,297
You would have missed it too. On one point I got the idea of Puls. and then I said no it can’t be

306
00:46:35,788 --> 00:46:56,545
because you think it’s a good remedy for gentle diseases and that’s a misunderstanding someone often has.

307
00:46:56,822 --> 00:47:03,464
If a remedy is gentle you don’t think that it has the power to cure such a violent disease.

308
00:47:03,734 --> 00:47:07,574
That is a misunderstanding we have in our brain.

309
00:47:08,184 --> 00:47:21,344
– I was treating in Germany, in the hospital in Munich was there anyone present? You were.

310
00:47:21,612 --> 00:47:36,224
You remember a case of lupus? Puls. It’s a serious condition!

311
00:47:36,464 --> 00:47:40,464
A systemic disease which has quite serious consequences.

312
00:47:41,344 --> 00:47:43,704
What was interesting in this particular case...

313
00:47:44,224 --> 00:47:53,944
I said Puls. and did not specify the potency. So the doctor gave 200C. No effect.

314
00:47:54,188 --> 00:47:59,544
He says if George said Puls., we better try 1M. No effect.

315
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:02,934
He said if George says Puls. we might have a high potency.

316
00:48:03,184 --> 00:48:10,344
The third month he prescribed Puls. 10M. Beautiful reaction, he says. I have his report...

317
00:48:21,354 --> 00:48:33,932
She shows me her original repertorization where the VES says Puls. is in the second place.

318
00:48:38,024 --> 00:48:45,452
– You remember von Boenighausen got Puls. from dr. Weiern,

319
00:48:45,944 --> 00:48:53,020
a scholar of Hahnemann himself, to get cured from tuberculosis.

320
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:09,260
– Sure! Any disease. There is no differentiation of remedies;

321
00:49:09,504 --> 00:49:12,737
this remedy is for an acute and this for chronic.

322
00:49:12,984 --> 00:49:26,028
This is total nonsense. The most severe case of cancer may be cured by Acon.

323
00:49:28,097 --> 00:49:37,045
– Puls. has desire for smoked food! I thought of Med. because of the arthritis in the knee!

324
00:49:38,064 --> 00:49:56,748
– You disregard the child’s character, worse heat and you went to Med. Med. is not incorrect.

325
00:49:57,428 --> 00:50:01,084
Most probably it’s the second or the third remedy.

326
00:50:02,064 --> 00:50:09,744
It’s not totally incorrect and that’s the problem because you prescribed well and you changed the symptoms!

327
00:50:10,017 --> 00:50:14,624
Because if you had prescribed altogether Ars...

328
00:50:31,724 --> 00:50:37,664
- I just wanted to ask a question about the early childhood of this kid

329
00:50:37,904 --> 00:50:50,977
because why would have such a severe otitis and got antibiotics for 6-7 times.

330
00:50:51,224 --> 00:51:00,184
What about the story from the mother, the heritage, the pregnancy, the birth of the child?

331
00:51:00,428 --> 00:51:11,457
– The otitis is covered very well by Puls. because it’s one of the main remedies for otitis.

332
00:51:11,704 --> 00:51:24,022
But I what I would expect with Puls. that the knee, the skin, otitis

333
00:51:24,264 --> 00:51:31,944
will come back but in the way it originally was. Not just little pain in my knee.

334
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:37,624
This is a little effort of the organism. It’s not the curative effort.

335
00:51:37,868 --> 00:51:45,377
The curative effort would make the knee develop an inflammation which is quite bad.

336
00:51:45,377 --> 00:51:54,544
– What about the eye?
– Once the knee is back no problem with the eye.

337
00:51:56,342 --> 00:51:59,905
The destroyed eye is finished.

338
00:52:00,182 --> 00:52:11,532
– Yes but before the knee is coming any eye problem?
– I don’t believe that.

339
00:52:11,784 --> 00:52:23,052
She says she doesn’t remember but even there you may say that the organism under the antibiotics for otitis

340
00:52:23,304 --> 00:52:35,340
has already gone down and is preparing to bring out an inflammation in the eye and the knee.

341
00:52:35,584 --> 00:52:41,224
If the inflammation in the knee is allowed to develop the eye will be spared.

342
00:52:43,584 --> 00:52:59,904
But iridocyclitis is considered as a rheumatic problem. Why do they say so?

343
00:53:00,172 --> 00:53:09,304
Because they saw it is connected with rheumatic situations.

344
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:14,944
That’s why they call it a rheumatic disease.

345
00:53:15,212 --> 00:53:25,944
It was the connection between the joints the inflammation in the iris.

346
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:28,524
This is what happens to the child.

347
00:53:29,204 --> 00:53:38,144
It goes finally to the eye but the organism definitely will try to protect it as much as possible.
