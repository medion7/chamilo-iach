1
00:00:23,046 --> 00:00:23,678
… Are you German?

2
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,240
– Yes, I’m German!

3
00:00:25,248 --> 00:00:27,990
– I thought you were English.

4
00:00:28,422 --> 00:00:29,606
–No, I am German.

5
00:00:30,182 --> 00:00:42,729
– So, you are a medical doctor, you have been in Homeopathy for 19 years, so you have been treated by other homeopaths in Germany.

6
00:00:43,185 --> 00:00:44,489
– Yes, one.

7
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:51,070
– Can you tell me what is your problem?

8
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:56,693
– My main problem is a very painful splenomegaly.

9
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,588
It’s 8 times as big as a normal.

10
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,251
– Why is that? Have they told you?

11
00:01:06,003 --> 00:01:11,250
– They have done all the investigation, blood analysis but without result.

12
00:01:12,058 --> 00:01:13,682
 There’s no reason, they don’t know.

13
00:01:15,234 --> 00:01:16,410
– Are you anemic?

14
00:01:16,786 --> 00:01:17,761
– Yes.

15
00:01:18,081 --> 00:01:19,457
– Severely anemic?

16
00:01:19,937 --> 00:01:30,871
– Yes. I always was anemic but severely anemic I was when I had profuse menses and my hemoglobin was very low for years.

17
00:01:33,855 --> 00:01:35,703
– The hemoglobin was very low?

18
00:01:36,191 --> 00:01:37,255
– Very low.

19
00:01:38,184 --> 00:01:40,687
– And did you ever had transfusions?

20
00:01:41,328 --> 00:01:47,287
– Yes, I had about 10 years ago, for half a year I had every month a transfusion.

21
00:01:47,823 --> 00:01:57,480
– So they don’t attribute this severe anemia to the fact that your spleen is large?

22
00:01:58,536 --> 00:02:09,740
– Because they didn’t find any other reasons for this splenomegaly they said it’s the only reason, why the spleen is so enlarged.

23
00:02:10,516 --> 00:02:12,060
– So you have pain as well?

24
00:02:12,749 --> 00:02:14,309
– I have pain, not always.

25
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,716
 It started 2 years before at night.

26
00:02:18,132 --> 00:02:20,108
 I had stitching pain all the time.

27
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,956
 – Where?

28
00:02:22,644 --> 00:02:27,646
– In the area of the spleen and especially when breathing in deeply.

29
00:02:28,534 --> 00:02:39,798
 It was very stitching and then I took China officinalis.

30
00:02:40,254 --> 00:02:41,462
– What potency?

31
00:02:44,390 --> 00:03:00,350
– 12 LM, every day for 2 weeks and after 2 weeks the pain stopped but I went on taking China. I took it for a year.

32
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,318
– Did it help?

33
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,854
– It helped perfectly.

34
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:13,038
– But you said this stitching pain started 2 years ago?

35
00:03:15,774 --> 00:03:32,990
– Yes. Suddenly one night I woke and I had stitching pain when breathing deeply and I could not lie on the left side at that time during night.

36
00:03:34,086 --> 00:03:43,366
– I see. So you said now your problem is splenomegaly with pain this means that pain continues?

37
00:03:44,574 --> 00:03:49,589
– The pain is not always  but it comes and goes.

38
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:56,110
– And did raise the potency, did you take another potency of China?

39
00:03:56,742 --> 00:04:05,878
– Yes, after one year I changed the potency and I took a 200C but it did not improve.

40
00:04:07,158 --> 00:04:18,639
I waited for about 2 months and then I took 1M and it was a little better but not really as it was the first time.

41
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:26,798
– But you repeated 12 LM? How low potency?

42
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,846
– I took 12 LM about a year…

43
00:04:31,406 --> 00:04:33,814
- Until it did not act anymore.

44
00:04:34,238 --> 00:04:35,630
– Yes.

45
00:04:39,837 --> 00:04:42,517
– So tell me your other problems.

46
00:04:43,262 --> 00:04:47,974
I am always tired, exhausted and weak.

47
00:04:48,486 --> 00:05:08,164
I have it because of the anemia but I’m very very weak especially in the morning , after sleep it
takes hours until I really have energy and it’s better in late afternoon about 16.00 or 17.00.

48
00:05:12,373 --> 00:05:16,116
 – After 16.00 and 17.00 or just between 16.00 or 17.00?

49
00:05:17,828 --> 00:05:23,420
– Not between. It starts to be better at 16.00 or 17.00 and then it goes up.

50
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,724
The morning is always very bad.

51
00:05:30,861 --> 00:05:41,669
The other problem I have; my menses have improved very much but still<br /> I am very weak when I have my menses.

52
00:05:42,444 --> 00:05:47,500
I weep all the time but I don’t know why.

53
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:50,940
– Weeping during menses or before?

54
00:05:51,365 --> 00:05:57,131
– During. And enormous weakness.

55
00:05:58,227 --> 00:06:02,843
The moment it starts I am weak, I have to lie in bed and I cannot work.

56
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:06,578
– Next…

57
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:26,880
- 10 years ago I had this problem with the menses,<br /> then it got better but the last 2 months it’s a little worse.

58
00:06:27,808 --> 00:06:30,288
It’s not as good as it was before.

59
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:42,536
 Then I have cystitis very often.

60
00:06:43,592 --> 00:06:47,672
I had it for the first time when I was 21, I remember.

61
00:06:48,696 --> 00:07:04,352
Then I got for a long time antibiotics, then it was better and since about 3-4 years I have it after each coitus,<br /> I have cystitis the next day.

62
00:07:08,592 --> 00:07:20,160
– The anemia started in very early age or it started later?

63
00:07:21,032 --> 00:07:28,112
– I remember that I always was pale and weak and tired all my life.

64
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:43,344
I never had really a lot of energy but 10 years before when my menses were suddenly<br /> so profuse the anemia got much worse.

65
00:07:48,777 --> 00:07:49,769
– Are you sleepy?

66
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,304
– Yes, I could always sleep.

67
00:08:03,336 --> 00:08:04,672
– And you are very chilly?

68
00:08:05,121 --> 00:08:09,065
– Very chilly, even in summer.

69
00:08:09,425 --> 00:08:11,976
– What remedies have you taken except of China?

70
00:08:12,464 --> 00:08:15,304
– Calc. 10 years ago...

71
00:08:16,176 --> 00:08:17,640
– Ars.?

72
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,456
– No.

73
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:42,992
– 10 years ago Ign., Phos-ac., Lyc. and Lach.<br /> And 3 years before Phos. That’s all.

74
00:08:47,272 --> 00:08:48,752
– Continue.

75
00:08:55,512 --> 00:09:12,544
– My other problem is that 3 years ago that my friend left me,<br /> we went together 20 years and since then I never felt really happy again.

76
00:09:13,312 --> 00:09:21,463
I am always very sad, I couldn’t overcome the relationship until now.

77
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:28,648
I weep easily when I talk about it, often I have dreams of our formal life.

78
00:09:30,224 --> 00:09:33,264
I meditate why did I fail.

79
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,809
– Did you take Puls.?

80
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:40,480
– No.

81
00:09:46,328 --> 00:09:48,953
– But you  are very chilly, still.

82
00:09:49,905 --> 00:09:51,849
– Yes, I am very chilly.

83
00:09:53,241 --> 00:09:59,153
It was even worse when anemia was worse, it’s a little better now but still I am chilly.

84
00:10:15,664 --> 00:10:17,088
I forgot one thing.

85
00:10:17,672 --> 00:10:31,888
Sometimes I have pain in my left kidney and doctor saw the CT and said that I have big spleen<br /> and it’s squeezing a little and so there’s congestion of the left kidney.

86
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:39,345
So it is suggested to operate the spleen but I don’t want to.

87
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:52,488
– Did you take after this separation Ign. or Nat-m.?

88
00:10:57,664 --> 00:11:00,224
– I took Ign. but it did not help.

89
00:11:01,281 --> 00:11:02,241
– Nat-m.?

90
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:04,128
– I did not take.

91
00:11:04,953 --> 00:11:07,296
– Do you need extra salt in your food?

92
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,616
– No.

93
00:11:09,672 --> 00:11:11,976
– Normal or even less than normal?

94
00:11:12,352 --> 00:11:13,928
– Normal.

95
00:11:14,728 --> 00:11:16,864
– But sweets?

96
00:11:17,464 --> 00:11:29,744
– I like sweets, hot, spice food and wine. If I drink wine I feel better, I have more energy.

97
00:11:33,184 --> 00:11:46,456
It refreshes me. I have to drink, not much because I’m tired,<br /> but I drink every day one glass of wine to feel good.

98
00:11:58,049 --> 00:12:00,600
– Continue.

99
00:12:01,456 --> 00:12:06,128
– No other problems. My main problem is the spleen.

100
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:10,104
– But you say also hay fever since…

101
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:14,689
- Oh! Yes, since I was a child I have it every year.

102
00:12:16,272 --> 00:12:18,440
– And if you don’t eat regularly...

103
00:12:19,192 --> 00:12:23,360
– I am very weak, I have to eat 3 times a day.

104
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:25,505
– Your nails?

105
00:12:25,848 --> 00:12:47,360
– Break easily. Also, I cannot climb a mountain.

106
00:12:48,129 --> 00:12:51,864
Even when I was 10 it was the same thing. I’m out of breath.

107
00:12:55,672 --> 00:12:56,888
– You have aversion to milk.

108
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,680
– Yes, I have aversion.

109
00:12:59,418 --> 00:13:00,680
– Very strong?

110
00:13:01,265 --> 00:13:02,873
– Yes, I cannot drink.

111
00:13:03,585 --> 00:13:05,985
– And meat?

112
00:13:06,289 --> 00:13:08,889
– Not very strong but I don’t like it.

113
00:13:09,312 --> 00:13:10,360
– Oysters?

114
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,168
– I hate. I could not eat.

115
00:13:14,368 --> 00:13:15,224
– And fat?

116
00:13:15,656 --> 00:13:20,136
– Also, very strong aversion. Not butter but fat.

117
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:29,553
– After this separation do you feel that you have closed up?

118
00:13:30,688 --> 00:13:39,625
– Yes. I don’t speak to anybody, I don’t show my feelings.

119
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:50,064
– Also you didn’t want to cry here.<br /> You said that you wanted to cry here but you controlled it.

120
00:13:50,465 --> 00:13:52,945
– Yes, I try.

121
00:13:53,728 --> 00:13:58,160
- At the same time you tell me you are weeping a lot when you are alone.

122
00:14:00,385 --> 00:14:02,704
Weeping during menses for instance…

123
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,408
- When I am alone I can weep.

124
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,104
– If I am familiar to somebody I can weep.

125
00:14:18,345 --> 00:14:20,840
– Do you like to be consoled?

126
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,312
– Yes, I like it.

127
00:14:25,008 --> 00:14:31,976
– How was your sexual desire?

128
00:14:34,121 --> 00:14:48,289
– It was normal but when profuse menses started I was always weak and <br />I had no desire due to lack of energy but normally it’s normal.

129
00:14:50,033 --> 00:15:01,057
– The fact that you separated with your friend was due to your fault,<br /> he put it as if it was your fault or his fault?

130
00:15:02,376 --> 00:15:04,456
– He put it to be my fault.

131
00:15:04,928 --> 00:15:06,872
Nothing special happened.

132
00:15:07,513 --> 00:15:11,280
But he had a strong desire for very young women.

133
00:15:11,896 --> 00:15:16,024
He was 60 years old and he found a 20-year-old woman.

134
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,728
It was a sort of tick he had.

135
00:15:22,145 --> 00:15:32,569
And he said I am too complicated for him because he was manager he had to travel a lot <br />and I am very homesick always.

136
00:15:33,904 --> 00:15:38,152
I did not want to travel with him and so we had a lot of problems together.

137
00:15:40,593 --> 00:15:42,593
– You have always been homesick?

138
00:15:43,017 --> 00:15:46,848
– Always. I remember when I was 15 I was homesick.

139
00:15:50,136 --> 00:15:52,536
– And you have some fears?

140
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,448
– I have some very strong fears.

141
00:15:55,872 --> 00:16:03,559
Fear of insects, beetles and spiders and fear of hospitals.

142
00:16:14,256 --> 00:16:16,040
No other fears.

143
00:16:17,081 --> 00:16:18,977
– Do you have dreams?

144
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:33,361
– Yes, always the same. I am living in a big house with a lot of windows<br /> and doors and it’s night and suddenly I feel that there’s somebody outside who wants to kill me.

145
00:16:34,545 --> 00:16:47,178
I feel threatened and I try to close doors and windows but I cannot do it so quickly and he approaches and at this moment I wake up.

146
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,000
– Dreams of being pursued.

147
00:16:52,297 --> 00:16:53,848
– Yes.

148
00:16:56,128 --> 00:17:06,601
– This friend with whom you were 20 years together was the first man for you?

149
00:17:07,057 --> 00:17:14,713
– No. But the cystitis started after him or before him?

150
00:17:15,081 --> 00:17:17,688
– Before him. After my first relationship it started.

151
00:17:20,512 --> 00:17:21,024
– The very first?

152
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:22,952
– Yes.

153
00:17:25,096 --> 00:17:28,520
– The very first relationship of yours was he a womanizer?

154
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:40,072
– No. But the second who left me he was a man who was interested in other women all the time we were together.

155
00:17:41,328 --> 00:17:42,832
But the first no.

156
00:17:43,793 --> 00:17:45,987
– Do you know if the first had gonorrhea?

157
00:17:46,585 --> 00:17:48,880
– No. But he (the second) had a gonorrhea.

158
00:17:53,376 --> 00:17:55,632
– How do you feel near the sea?

159
00:17:56,497 --> 00:18:05,257
– I feel very good and now I am in Alonissos for one week I am not tired.

160
00:18:05,888 --> 00:18:14,232
Also I cannot sleep during night because it is so hot, I have fear of insects but I wake up in the morning and I am not tired.

161
00:18:15,168 --> 00:18:16,912
It’s amazing.

162
00:18:17,552 --> 00:18:18,976
– The climate is helping you.

163
00:18:19,337 --> 00:18:20,937
– It’s good for me.

164
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,504
– You work as a homeopath or in a hospital?

165
00:18:25,488 --> 00:18:30,272
– I work together with other 5 homeopaths, not in a hospital.

166
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:32,192
– Which area?

167
00:18:32,944 --> 00:18:34,568
– In Munich.

168
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,673
– Can you describe your character?

169
00:18:40,168 --> 00:18:44,424
– Yes. I never become really furious.

170
00:18:45,272 --> 00:18:51,035
I am very soft, very mild, very compliant, I have desire for harmony.

171
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,736
It’s easy to live with me.

172
00:18:59,912 --> 00:19:10,665
– But you think this is because you suppress your anger or your negative emotions or is it because your character is like this.

173
00:19:10,993 --> 00:19:12,721
– No, it’s my character.

174
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:18,672
– And in spite of this you describe a case of Puls.

175
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:27,856
You describe your character as we describe it in the Materia Medica for Puls. Compliant, soft…

176
00:19:28,241 --> 00:19:31,753
- I have a lot of Puls. elements.

177
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,192
– You said you are very chilly. But does draft affect you as well?

178
00:19:45,096 --> 00:19:51,391
– It affects me but also when I am very chilly I have a lot of desire for fresh air, always.

179
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,584
And draft affects me.

180
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,112
– Very much?

181
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:06,033
– Not so much.

182
00:20:10,552 --> 00:20:15,848
– Here you say you’re worse by change of weather. You feel it?

183
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,456
– Yes.

184
00:20:18,352 --> 00:20:21,192
– And worse in the sun. In spite you’re chilly you are worse in the sun.

185
00:20:21,665 --> 00:20:26,352
– Yes, I could never lie in the sun without an umbrella. I feel weak and exhausted.

186
00:20:27,672 --> 00:20:30,192
– Full moon, cold and heat.

187
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,824
– Yes. I don’t sleep very well in full moon.

188
00:20:39,273 --> 00:20:42,760
– You say I have a strong desire for protection and safety.

189
00:20:43,072 --> 00:20:45,608
– It’s true.

190
00:20:46,136 --> 00:20:55,337
For example, all my friends are 20-25 older than me because I am longing for protection.

191
00:20:56,897 --> 00:20:59,705
– That’s why your man was also quite older.

192
00:21:00,152 --> 00:21:01,240
– Yes.

193
00:21:01,712 --> 00:21:03,680
– 20 years?

194
00:21:03,976 --> 00:21:06,241
– Now he is 60… yes, 20 years.

195
00:21:10,473 --> 00:21:11,401
– You like dogs?

196
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,417
– I love dogs.

197
00:21:14,241 --> 00:21:16,208
– And you suffered very much when he died?

198
00:21:17,705 --> 00:21:20,592
– Yes. I was really sick when he died.

199
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:30,361
– You had a kind of rape when you were 12?

200
00:21:31,233 --> 00:21:33,873
– Yes. By a known person or unknown?

201
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:36,192
– A known person.

202
00:21:42,289 --> 00:21:59,025
– This made you afraid of men? You cannot say… - I cannot say.

203
00:22:03,257 --> 00:22:11,864
But it was a shock because at that time I was in monastery, in a boarding school and had no idea of what was going on.

204
00:22:14,353 --> 00:22:17,025
So it was really a big shock what happened.

205
00:22:20,729 --> 00:22:24,065
I was educated very strictly, very catholic.

206
00:22:29,145 --> 00:22:34,609
– Also you have a desire for order and cleanliness and you feel easily disgusted.

207
00:22:34,969 --> 00:22:36,161
– Yes.

208
00:22:41,537 --> 00:22:43,057
– Former disease?

209
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,017
Tell us.

210
00:22:48,649 --> 00:22:59,602
– At the age of 18 I had a tonsillectomy because when I was a child I had very often tonsillitis, very painful, every winter 2-3 times.

211
00:23:00,609 --> 00:23:03,376
Then often cystitis, as I said.

212
00:23:04,178 --> 00:23:07,529
At the age of 21 I had appendectomy.

213
00:23:09,385 --> 00:23:12,985
When I was 8 adenoids were operated.

214
00:23:15,081 --> 00:23:19,856
And between the age of 21 and 35 I had 4 times a miscarriage.

215
00:23:22,249 --> 00:23:23,433
– You don’t have a child?

216
00:23:23,809 --> 00:23:25,313
– No.

217
00:23:25,601 --> 00:23:27,281
– 4 times you had a miscarriage?

218
00:23:27,665 --> 00:23:29,513
– Yes, but involuntary.

219
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,960
And the profuse menses 10 years before.

220
00:23:44,073 --> 00:23:55,289
In 1996 I had 2 times very severe inflammation of the lungs, 3 years ago.

221
00:23:58,697 --> 00:24:02,377
– Your father died with Alzheimer disease at the age of 80.

222
00:24:03,369 --> 00:24:05,441
– Yes, 2 years ago he died.

223
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:11,641
– Your mother suffers with headaches.

224
00:24:12,112 --> 00:24:13,832
– Yes, since 40 years.

225
00:24:14,401 --> 00:24:15,618
– You don’t suffer with headaches?

226
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:18,169
– Never.

227
00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:20,929
– You have enough already!

228
00:24:26,692 --> 00:24:28,204
–You eat meat?

229
00:24:29,684 --> 00:24:33,412
– I ate because of my anemia but not because I like it.

230
00:24:34,381 --> 00:24:35,213
I don’t like it.

231
00:24:36,357 --> 00:24:37,973
– Not any kind of meat?

232
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:44,980
– I can eat chicken. No other kinds.

233
00:24:45,452 --> 00:24:46,660
– Lamb?

234
00:24:49,077 --> 00:24:49,469
– No.

235
00:24:49,813 --> 00:24:50,341
– Pork?

236
00:24:50,717 --> 00:24:53,749
– No. Not at all, I hate the taste.

237
00:24:59,677 --> 00:25:02,284
– How much water do you need?

238
00:25:03,972 --> 00:25:07,572
– I’m very thirsty, I drink about 2 lt a day.

239
00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:11,797
– And it has to be cold or room temperature?

240
00:25:12,421 --> 00:25:14,893
– It doesn’t have to be cold.

241
00:25:15,269 --> 00:25:17,405
I like warm drinks.

242
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:25,285
But it depends on the season but it has not to be cold.

243
00:25:33,205 --> 00:25:41,469
– At this period you are constipated?

244
00:25:42,404 --> 00:25:43,508
– Yes.

245
00:25:43,965 --> 00:25:41,728
Whenever I am travelling I am constipated.

246
00:25:42,328 --> 00:25:46,832
Even if I am travelling 2 weeks.

247
00:25:58,089 --> 00:26:00,072
I believe everybody knows the remedy.

248
00:26:08,729 --> 00:26:11,441
Your nails are really brittle?

249
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,305
She said your nails are brittle. I want to know how much.

250
00:26:20,232 --> 00:26:22,632
Do they really break?

251
00:26:23,921 --> 00:26:29,396
– At the moment it’s ok but sometimes they break.

252
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,092
– They have white spots.

253
00:26:32,572 --> 00:26:34,812
– No, it was a pressure.

254
00:26:39,813 --> 00:26:41,660
– Her hands are very cold.

255
00:26:43,892 --> 00:26:45,332
You did not tell us about your perspiration.

256
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:50,372
– When I am excited I perspire easily.

257
00:26:52,205 --> 00:26:53,069
– Not when you sleep?

258
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:54,901
– Never in sleep.

259
00:27:05,716 --> 00:27:21,812
– In this case you will have to differentiate between several remedies one of which is Puls., the second is Sil., the third is Med., the fourth is Nat-m.

260
00:27:23,132 --> 00:27:25,108
These are the possibilities in this case.

261
00:27:26,148 --> 00:27:37,861
Puls., Sil., Nat-m., Med. Whatelse?

262
00:27:39,164 --> 00:27:43,302
Mang. is a possibility for this case.

263
00:27:45,574 --> 00:27:47,726
Severe anemia, Mang. Somebody was asking.

264
00:27:48,414 --> 00:27:56,108
Causes severe anemia and makes the person very tired and wants to lay down all the time.

265
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:09,755
By lying down Mang. feels better even in their anxiety, if they are depressed, they lie down and they feel better.

266
00:28:09,893 --> 00:28:11,843
They have cough, they lie down and they feel better.

267
00:28:12,555 --> 00:28:14,579
They have a pain, they lie down and they’re better.

268
00:28:16,579 --> 00:28:20,755
Lying down is the essential feature of Mang.

269
00:28:25,315 --> 00:28:33,475
Now, she wants to lie down all the time and sleepiness.

270
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:40,322
People without much hemoglobin they, easily become sleepy,

271
00:28:40,795 --> 00:28:42,594
they want to sleep all the time.

272
00:28:43,659 --> 00:28:45,771
The patient says I can sleep anytime.

273
00:28:48,619 --> 00:28:52,851
The thing is which is remedy at this moment.

274
00:28:53,291 --> 00:29:08,403
She has been through a kind of a grief, she does not show so much, but most probably she feels it quite a lot.

275
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:12,003
Correct?

276
00:29:15,227 --> 00:29:19,202
– I want to ask a little bit more about the consolation.

277
00:29:19,723 --> 00:29:25,667
She said she likes it but she’s a very closed person, eventually, if you are very closed you don’t like consolation.

278
00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:29,235
So I’d like her to clarify that first.

279
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:38,115
– If I am very much familiar to somebody I like consolation but from people I don’t know never.

280
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:41,523
If somebody is very close to me…

281
00:29:42,099 --> 00:29:43,883
- You will accept.

282
00:29:45,795 --> 00:29:51,210
– The things that we have to consider is the remedies she took before.

283
00:29:53,451 --> 00:29:55,659
Which of these remedies have acted?

284
00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:07,075
China has acted, that means China was indicated and China did whatever it could.

285
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:22,619
After that there seems that all the other remedies used were not effective, left the case as it was with China, and even a bit worse.

286
00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:30,611
After this we consider that China was the correct for the time she took it.

287
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:43,300
And now we have the next remedy to consider after China. China-related remedies;

288
00:30:44,635 --> 00:31:09,684
China followed well by Ferr. is possibility, Calc-p. Complementary remedies to China is Ferr. Very good. Nat-m. is there as you can see.

289
00:31:23,283 --> 00:31:25,291
Show the repertorization.

290
00:31:26,347 --> 00:31:32,857
Now you will see the remedies that come up more prominent.

291
00:31:33,657 --> 00:31:41,145
Is Nat-m., Ign., Puls., Ph-ac. Ph-ac. she received, there is no question about that.

292
00:31:43,386 --> 00:31:49,193
So either you choose Nat-m., Ign. she took there was no real effect…

293
00:31:50,081 --> 00:31:56,193
So you have actually to choose between Nat-m. and Puls.

294
00:32:01,682 --> 00:32:15,018
Taken into consideration the great amelioration in the sea, Med. is possible because her husband had gonorrhea before.

295
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:27,674
So, we may consider.  Is the first remedy Med., Puls., or Sil.?

296
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:30,650
– What position do you sleep in?

297
00:32:41,369 --> 00:32:47,665
– I sleep mostly on the back and my hands are upon my head.

298
00:32:59,545 --> 00:33:01,930
– She is improved in the seaside.

299
00:33:04,906 --> 00:33:10,578
– Alonissos has special vibrations which improve everybody!

300
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:12,546
I don’t think so.

301
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:15,785
I feel very tired here.

302
00:33:23,834 --> 00:33:32,650
But in spite of that tell me your opinion.

303
00:33:34,273 --> 00:33:35,889
Do you have another idea?

304
00:33:36,658 --> 00:33:38,874
Do you want to give another remedy? Ferr.?

305
00:33:42,538 --> 00:34:10,162
Let’s see who wants to speak for Puls. 21. Sil? Nobody. Nat-m.? 42. Med.? 2. Mang.?

306
00:34:10,577 --> 00:34:35,874
No. Ferr.? 2. Plus one, me, 3…no.

307
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:52,818
In this repertorization I will put one more symptom and see what happens.

308
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:58,554
Which is this symptom I want to introduce?

309
00:35:02,145 --> 00:35:08,273
Show the list of symptoms.

310
00:35:13,386 --> 00:35:25,314
Weeping during menses, enlarged spleen three times, stitching pains on abdomen, copious menses, general;

311
00:35:25,938 --> 00:35:34,257
afternoon amelioration , anemia. Anemia actually you have to introduce with 3 degrees, it’s a very severe anemia.

312
00:35:55,385 --> 00:36:06,378
General weakness; three times, pain during urination, sleepiness, bladder pain after coition,

313
00:36:09,266 --> 00:36:17,441
desires spicy food, alcoholic drinks, she actually said wine but anyhow.

314
00:36:19,138 --> 00:36:25,954
You put it twice... ameliorates.

315
00:36:31,288 --> 00:36:38,215
Extremities; nails, complaints; brittle nails, aversion fat, aversion milk,

316
00:36:39,247 --> 00:36:49,656
homesickness underlined 3 times, fears of insects, fear going to the hospital,

317
00:36:50,808 --> 00:37:02,336
dreams of being pursued, worse after coition, sea air ameliorates, mildness,

318
00:37:03,824 --> 00:37:15,728
change of weather aggravates, exposal to the sun, mortification, tendency to abortion…

319
00:37:16,704 --> 00:37:29,136
forget it, take it out. Rectum; constipation while travelling.

320
00:37:35,304 --> 00:37:35,992
That’s it.

321
00:37:37,104 --> 00:37:42,504
Show me now what is the result.

322
00:37:43,872 --> 00:37:47,544
It’s Nat-m., Ign. and Puls.

323
00:37:49,655 --> 00:37:54,167
Now we put one more symptom which she had.

324
00:37:55,976 --> 00:38:00,584
– I’d like to put sleep; unrefreshing underlined 3 times.

325
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,759
Because she woke up very tired in the morning.

326
00:38:09,263 --> 00:38:11,063
– She’s tired all the time.

327
00:38:12,192 --> 00:38:17,078
But she is even worse then. Sleep; unrefreshing, in the morning.

328
00:38:19,462 --> 00:38:26,166
Unrefreshing sleep or in the morning?

329
00:38:28,711 --> 00:38:31,703
– More tired in the morning and then in the evening.

330
00:38:32,918 --> 00:38:34,798
– So weakness in the morning .

331
00:38:36,974 --> 00:38:38,990
– Morning, tired in the morning.

332
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:45,342
– Yes put this. How many times?

333
00:38:46,615 --> 00:39:02,511
3 times. Tired in the morning. Mag-c. Put this 3 times.

334
00:39:10,694 --> 00:39:14,398
– I’d like to ask a question about music, if it affects her and how.

335
00:39:15,798 --> 00:39:17,918
– She likes music, she’s German!

336
00:39:27,414 --> 00:39:30,502
– I like music very much, especially classical music.

337
00:39:31,526 --> 00:39:37,174
– She’s not Tarent., she definitely.

338
00:39:38,615 --> 00:39:59,735
She is the opposite of Tarent. Nat-m. again. Puls., Calc., Phos-ac…  Can you find it?

339
00:40:00,103 --> 00:40:03,014
Sleeping with the hand over the head?

340
00:40:04,222 --> 00:40:06,430
I want to put another symptom.

341
00:40:06,886 --> 00:40:08,438
Which one?

342
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:15,830
She said about some kind of food she hates; pork.

343
00:40:22,807 --> 00:40:25,590
– She said she hates oyster.

344
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:31,015
– Oysters and pork, so we can put both.

345
00:40:34,623 --> 00:40:37,903
Aversion oysters and pork.

346
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:51,375
Put these two, twice.

347
00:40:54,423 --> 00:40:57,126
Arms under the head or like this?

348
00:40:59,855 --> 00:41:02,303
Over the head.

349
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:04,767
Can you find it?

350
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:11,495
2 times.

351
00:41:19,391 --> 00:41:21,175
Put 4 times!

352
00:41:29,583 --> 00:41:30,983
Forget it.

353
00:41:31,272 --> 00:41:32,839
You have no chance!

354
00:41:37,711 --> 00:41:39,319
Show me the result.

355
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:50,991
Still Nat-m. Useless!

356
00:41:56,687 --> 00:42:03,248
So what is the problem now? Weeping?

357
00:42:06,031 --> 00:42:08,478
She did not weep here.

358
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:11,151
She started but she controlled it.

359
00:42:12,151 --> 00:42:14,095
This is more of Nat-m. tendency.

360
00:42:14,959 --> 00:42:20,863
Nat-m. will hold it. Puls. will not be able to hold it so much.

361
00:42:24,823 --> 00:42:27,239
So what is going to be the first remedy?

362
00:42:32,399 --> 00:42:33,591
– I just have a question.

363
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:42,495
I asked if she had fever blisters and she does have that every year, once a year.

364
00:42:43,399 --> 00:42:46,551
– Very good, put fever blisters.

365
00:42:54,063 --> 00:42:55,967
Did you put worse from sun?

366
00:43:04,383 --> 00:43:07,751
Good. Fever blisters; lips.

367
00:43:08,679 --> 00:43:35,919
As you may see this repertorization is very fast but you have to balance in her case a few things which are in favor of Nat-m. and others which are in favor of Puls.

368
00:43:41,135 --> 00:43:51,168
So the question is; is this a Nat-m. case on a deeper level?

369
00:43:56,311 --> 00:43:58,959
You are asking this question.

370
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:22,967
All her symptoms are symptoms of Nat-m. as the repertorization is showing or maybe Nat-m. is on top at this moment and underneath is something else?

371
00:44:25,383 --> 00:44:28,630
This is the problem which you have to solve.

372
00:44:33,607 --> 00:44:37,263
And in favor of Nat-m. is what?

373
00:44:39,631 --> 00:44:45,254
Tell me a keynote on which you will base your prescription on Nat-m.

374
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:56,119
Those who prescribed Nat-m. must speak now. Grief.

375
00:44:57,151 --> 00:44:59,103
She has grief.

376
00:45:09,999 --> 00:45:13,231
How she reacts to this grief?

377
00:45:18,495 --> 00:45:21,166
Show me the grief remedies.

378
00:45:23,647 --> 00:45:39,671
Let’s make a little bit of differential diagnosis. Aur., Caust., Ign., Nat-m., Puls., Staph. Capital.

379
00:45:41,495 --> 00:45:46,943
– I would like to ask if she’s got any kind of hatred towards ex-husband.

380
00:45:54,576 --> 00:45:59,263
What it has to do with hatred in general.

381
00:46:04,423 --> 00:46:19,439
– Any woman who is with a man for 20 years and the husband left she would like to kill him. This is the natural.

382
00:46:21,479 --> 00:46:24,095
You’ll see what she will say.

383
00:46:27,511 --> 00:46:29,238
– No feelings of hate.

384
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:33,489
I feel no hate.

385
00:46:35,889 --> 00:46:36,393
I feel sad.

386
00:46:36,721 --> 00:46:38,369
– She mostly blames herself.

387
00:46:39,377 --> 00:46:46,577
You have to be careful when your patient is giving you the history.

388
00:46:47,329 --> 00:46:57,746
She said many times I weep alone or I stay and I meditate to see where I was wrong.

389
00:46:58,626 --> 00:47:00,322
What did I do wrong.

390
00:47:01,337 --> 00:47:21,689
Where is my responsibility. Grief. Ign. If she is meditating forget Ign.

391
00:47:23,009 --> 00:47:25,241
She’s not for meditation, she’s for action.

392
00:47:25,753 --> 00:47:28,697
Quick act, responses.

393
00:47:30,489 --> 00:47:36,640
She will hate the bastard and she would like to take some revenge

394
00:47:37,889 --> 00:47:44,841
and she will try different things for example appearing in front of him

395
00:47:45,457 --> 00:47:52,584
with another boyfriend and then going home and hitting herself and going in to spasms

396
00:47:52,865 --> 00:47:54,393
and reactions.

397
00:47:55,561 --> 00:47:59,705
Then she will sob.

398
00:48:00,673 --> 00:48:03,313
She’s not sobbing and she is not hysterical.

399
00:48:04,929 --> 00:48:13,432
A similar but deeper reaction will be from Nat-m. Nat-m. takes life very seriously,

400
00:48:14,113 --> 00:48:22,553
especially a relation which is ended is a very serious matter for Nat-m.

401
00:48:23,113 --> 00:48:28,025
They will take it very seriously, they’re hurt.

402
00:48:31,682 --> 00:48:42,466
They will go in bed and they cannot cry and the emotions stay here,

403
00:48:43,345 --> 00:48:49,096
are choked there and some tears are coming out.

404
00:48:49,745 --> 00:48:54,457
They try to cry, to relieve themselves but they cannot.

405
00:48:56,649 --> 00:49:09,121
This is the typical Nat-m. reaction after breaking up. A Puls. reaction…

406
00:49:10,041 --> 00:49:15,378
A Staph. reaction… you would like to hear?

407
00:49:25,625 --> 00:49:34,737
Staph.; you have to take the consideration that Staph. in case we have exactly the same situation,

408
00:49:35,353 --> 00:49:48,721
20 years living with a man and the man finally leaves, Staph. will be crying a lot,

409
00:49:49,585 --> 00:49:53,369
we’ll be weeping all the time.

410
00:49:55,018 --> 00:49:59,505
She will not be able to control herself, she doesn’t want to control herself.

411
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:07,737
And what is important, through this reaction she will not deadened her emotions

412
00:50:08,225 --> 00:50:14,192
where Nat-m…. Let us say Nat-m. had 90% emotions.

413
00:50:15,498 --> 00:50:19,065
In any case if you are a Nat-m. you have less than normal emotions.

414
00:50:19,881 --> 00:50:22,433
The emotions have been reduced to 98% already.

415
00:50:23,897 --> 00:50:34,161
But you have a relation which leaves you, then the emotions are reduced 50%

416
00:50:35,353 --> 00:50:39,665
and sometime only 10% of the emotions stay.

417
00:50:40,513 --> 00:50:47,777
All the rest is suppressed, swallowed and I am not going to show them again.

418
00:50:49,065 --> 00:50:58,161
And then you see this hard emotional state in which you cannot penetrate

419
00:50:58,937 --> 00:51:04,265
and if you manage to penetrate through talking and

420
00:51:04,593 --> 00:51:13,137
communicating the characteristic is that…

421
00:51:13,513 --> 00:51:15,937
Nat-m. you can open it and he can talk.

422
00:51:16,853 --> 00:51:19,885
But afterwards we will go back home and he will have a terrible headache,

423
00:51:20,685 --> 00:51:24,244
will be depleted from energy, will be terrible.

424
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:29,020
The fact that she has spoken is a great aggravation.

425
00:51:30,685 --> 00:51:32,293
Because she spoke to you.

426
00:51:33,573 --> 00:51:37,213
You think she will feel better now; no, it’s the opposite, she feels worse.

427
00:51:38,557 --> 00:51:46,789
That is typical of Nat-m. Not with Staph. Staph. will be better and will feel easy

428
00:51:47,269 --> 00:51:50,045
and the emotions remain.

429
00:51:50,429 --> 00:51:58,733
Let us say if she had 95% emotions he will go up to 90% or 87%.

430
00:51:59,365 --> 00:52:01,612
The emotions will be reduced very little.

431
00:52:04,629 --> 00:52:12,820
The emotion together with the sexual desire are not easily affected.

432
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:21,917
They feel destroyed, they cry for long periods of time but the emotions are not dead.

433
00:52:23,229 --> 00:52:30,556
This part of the human being is still alive and that is important where with Phos-ac…,

434
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:42,315
it’s one of the main remedies for grief, especially which comes after death,

435
00:52:42,964 --> 00:52:55,021
loss of beloved persons. It’s paralyzed… it’s not the right word.

436
00:52:57,836 --> 00:53:05,476
Exhausted in mind and body and emotions.

437
00:53:06,108 --> 00:53:07,669
Primarily in the emotions.

438
00:53:08,572 --> 00:53:10,644
The emotions just go dead.

439
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:18,236
With Nat-m. we have 45% emotions left.

440
00:53:19,645 --> 00:53:23,618
With Ph-ac. we have 2%. Nothing.

441
00:53:25,314 --> 00:53:30,553
So they reach that state of total indifference where they say I don’t care,

442
00:53:31,089 --> 00:53:39,241
I don’t want to remember, they forget, the memory goes totally down.

443
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:43,586
They close up.

444
00:53:44,162 --> 00:53:47,041
But they can tell you, they can communicate,

445
00:53:47,689 --> 00:53:51,562
they can relate to you what was exactly the situation.

446
00:53:52,233 --> 00:54:03,257
With Nat-m. it will be very difficult to accept that this man or woman left me.

447
00:54:07,561 --> 00:54:13,025
You’ll see resistance in telling you.

448
00:54:14,106 --> 00:54:20,209
If somebody comes and tells you this man left me, it’s either Staph. or Puls.

449
00:54:29,081 --> 00:54:31,345
There is maybe some crying, or maybe not.

450
00:54:32,322 --> 00:54:35,178
It’s so easy to say.

451
00:54:36,306 --> 00:55:02,353
For Nat-m. and Ign. they are too humiliating for them,

452
00:55:04,121 --> 00:55:10,017
for Ign. but especially for Nat-m. the humiliation element is tremendous.

453
00:55:10,562 --> 00:55:14,577
They don’t want to be humiliated in front of you, in front of the class.

454
00:55:15,274 --> 00:55:20,786
If somebody comes and tells you that my husband left after 20 years because ,

455
00:55:21,321 --> 00:55:32,945
it’s almost a marriage, and she says I am a person that I need protection,

456
00:55:35,161 --> 00:55:42,441
I’m soft, I’m easygoing. How do we describe Puls.?

457
00:55:43,066 --> 00:55:46,690
She couldn’t have described better Puls.

458
00:55:47,313 --> 00:55:51,018
What she described is a typical Puls. case.

459
00:55:53,937 --> 00:55:57,513
What is the problem with Puls.?

460
00:55:58,737 --> 00:55:59,945
The grief?

461
00:56:00,786 --> 00:56:02,210
The grief of Puls. is there.

462
00:56:02,546 --> 00:56:03,442
The sun?

463
00:56:04,074 --> 00:56:06,033
The sun is there. The exhaustion?

464
00:56:06,401 --> 00:56:07,937
The exhaustion is there.

465
00:56:08,561 --> 00:56:12,265
She has all the symptoms.

466
00:56:13,009 --> 00:56:15,457
And the pork she hates.

467
00:56:17,458 --> 00:56:21,010
The way she sleeps is typical of Puls.

468
00:56:22,442 --> 00:56:30,481
It is absolutely typical of Puls. sleeping with the hand over the head.

469
00:56:31,425 --> 00:56:33,129
You don’t know that.

470
00:56:33,521 --> 00:56:38,145
It doesn’t matter, I say it for those who doesn’t know.

471
00:56:40,361 --> 00:56:42,179
Then the aversion to fat.

472
00:56:46,666 --> 00:56:48,978
What else do we have for Puls.?

473
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:55,970
Better from fresh air.

474
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:58,098
In spite the fact that she is so chilly.

475
00:56:58,578 --> 00:57:00,969
Let’s put chilly.

476
00:57:01,753 --> 00:57:04,489
Show me chilly remedies.

477
00:57:05,721 --> 00:57:07,449
What you may have been thinking is…

478
00:57:08,561 --> 00:57:20,673
For a moment I thought this is a case where we first need to go to Sil. which is cold and then complement the Sil. action with Puls.

479
00:57:21,449 --> 00:57:28,617
But the information as it was coming was overwhelming for Puls.

480
00:57:29,370 --> 00:57:44,658
So the fact that she is on the cold side we have Puls. many times and especially in an acute situation, she chills but still wants to be fanned.

481
00:57:50,097 --> 00:58:01,138
But she has chills. Puls. is not always a remedy which is very much aggravated by heat.

482
00:58:04,906 --> 00:58:08,601
– But she likes to drink a lot. She is thirsty.

483
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:14,753
– Let’s see thirst. Warm drink.

484
00:58:15,601 --> 00:58:35,057
This is a problem but thirst… see excessive thirst… extreme.

485
00:58:36,233 --> 00:58:42,617
The problem is that she needs warm drink,

486
00:58:42,921 --> 00:58:49,098
show me desires warm drinks. Ars., Bry. and Lac-c.

487
00:58:55,954 --> 00:59:21,089
Here we really don’t have the Puls. Puls. has aversion.

488
00:59:24,777 --> 00:59:26,689
– In the rubric desires warm drinks.

489
00:59:27,161 --> 00:59:31,609
And hot is another rubric then Puls. is in the second degree.

490
00:59:49,970 --> 00:59:52,058
– Spicy food.

491
00:59:54,329 --> 00:59:56,513
This is not a problem.

492
01:00:00,833 --> 01:00:13,344
Let us say the most prominent remedy for this lady is Puls.

493
01:00:14,224 --> 01:00:15,208
There is no question.

494
01:00:15,768 --> 01:00:23,871
My only question is before Puls. she needs a Med. or a Sil.?

495
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:27,327
This is the only question I’m asking.

496
01:00:28,519 --> 01:00:35,944
Should we give before Puls., Sil. or Med. first?

497
01:00:36,448 --> 01:00:38,600
Because of the amelioration.

498
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:51,952
We don’t have anything else except the amelioration from the sea.

499
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:57,927
We don’t have any other symptom to support Med.

500
01:00:59,367 --> 01:01:01,359
Evening ameliorates perhaps.

501
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:05,384
– Did she get a splenomegaly after the transfusions?

502
01:01:07,464 --> 01:01:10,368
– The splenomegaly was after the transfusion?

503
01:01:25,472 --> 01:01:35,720
– The blood transfusion was in 1986 and the splenomegaly was 2 years before.

504
01:01:39,856 --> 01:01:52,080
– The splenomegaly was 2 years before the transfusion but not even if it was after the transfusion.

505
01:01:55,113 --> 01:02:04,762
If you go to the remedy, you can find remedies which affect the spleen especially.

506
01:02:05,602 --> 01:02:08,458
Fer. is a possibility., Cean. is a possibility.

507
01:02:10,185 --> 01:02:15,457
But when you have such a case where you have so strong symptoms for a remedy

508
01:02:16,089 --> 01:02:22,105
you don’t go to such little remedies unless this  fails.

509
01:02:24,386 --> 01:02:30,425
The problem is Puls. in what potency…

510
01:02:35,674 --> 01:02:44,866
- Did you have any investigation on the red blood cells as sickle cell anemia?

511
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:53,001
– Blood analysis was made, everything was made and nothing was found.

512
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:58,818
– Like osmotic resistance and things like that?

513
01:03:06,298 --> 01:03:11,769
-  The question we have in this case is can we reduce the spleen.

514
01:03:14,122 --> 01:03:21,921
I believe yes, giving my prognosis for this case I say in spite of the fact

515
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:30,601
it looks quite serious the prognosis is not so bad and we will be able to reduce.

516
01:03:31,434 --> 01:03:33,603
How long it may take?

517
01:03:37,577 --> 01:03:43,137
I believe the time that she will need treatment is 3 years.

518
01:03:45,177 --> 01:03:55,545
In 3 years you will have a considerable reduction of the spleen and of course a considerable amelioration of her usual case.

519
01:03:56,489 --> 01:03:59,841
Now we go to the potency.

520
01:04:02,305 --> 01:04:08,649
Always with the potency you ask yourself if the pathology

521
01:04:09,522 --> 01:04:16,337
is going to be in the way of your potency.

522
01:04:17,169 --> 01:04:20,977
That means the high potency will push the organism to go away

523
01:04:21,842 --> 01:04:32,266
and start but if there is substantial physical pathology will stop this very soon

524
01:04:32,657 --> 01:04:34,649
and will have a relapse.

525
01:04:35,481 --> 01:04:41,065
Therefore, the fact that the spleen is not actually performing,

526
01:04:41,418 --> 01:04:48,681
becomes bigger and bigger to comply with the demands of the body

527
01:04:50,985 --> 01:04:54,921
and the spleen is not in a good condition.

528
01:04:55,201 --> 01:04:59,889
Therefore the spleen will be an obstacle.

529
01:05:01,170 --> 01:05:09,346
Therefore we have to go slowly into stimulating this organism.

530
01:05:14,337 --> 01:05:20,377
The remedy is Puls. 12C.

531
01:05:22,153 --> 01:05:50,690
It will be good enough given 3 times daily and try to raise the potency 12C like 13C after 10 days, every 10 days you raise one potency.

532
01:05:54,945 --> 01:05:57,801
– I would like to speak against Puls.

533
01:06:01,721 --> 01:06:04,489
– I spoke against but you can speak against also.

534
01:06:07,858 --> 01:06:11,274
– Puls. is not in the rubric enlarged.

535
01:06:12,961 --> 01:06:16,705
Her spleen is 8 times bigger than normal.

536
01:06:20,121 --> 01:06:23,057
–Find anemia…

537
01:06:25,290 --> 01:06:32,705
-  And then she’s very thirsty and I can’t see that this is a very clear Puls. case.

538
01:06:33,513 --> 01:06:35,729
There’s a lot of Nat-m. there.

539
01:06:36,353 --> 01:06:38,001
I want to speak for Cean.

540
01:06:38,489 --> 01:06:45,601
Because in Phatak it says this remedy has a special affinity to the spleen,

541
01:06:47,025 --> 01:06:49,018
which enlarges enormously.

542
01:06:49,641 --> 01:06:51,233
Pain in left hypochondria.

543
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:55,729
Anaemic patients where liver and spleen are at fault.

544
01:06:56,185 --> 01:06:57,465
Enlargement of liver.

545
01:06:59,170 --> 01:07:05,281
And it is complementary to Nat-m. and related to Chin. which has acted.

546
01:07:06,641 --> 01:07:10,321
So in this case I will consider Cean. strongly.

547
01:07:26,321 --> 01:07:31,633
– Here anemia, if you look anemia, you see Puls.

548
01:07:32,969 --> 01:07:40,713
One of the main symptoms which kent relates is anemic woman etc.

549
01:07:41,625 --> 01:07:48,729
The fact that there is severe anemia the spleen is going to be affected so therefore

550
01:07:49,017 --> 01:07:57,168
logically you can come to the conclusion that definitely Puls. will affect the spleen.

551
01:07:57,898 --> 01:08:00,665
It doesn’t matter whether it has been recorded or not.

552
01:08:01,273 --> 01:08:03,625
Somebody tell me has been recorded already…

553
01:08:04,633 --> 01:08:09,961
So this is not against Puls.

554
01:08:10,386 --> 01:08:15,145
Especially take notice of that; that if you have a picture of a remedy,

555
01:08:16,369 --> 01:08:19,521
it doesn’t matter whether the remedy has produced the pathology.

556
01:08:22,393 --> 01:08:26,809
You can give any remedy as long as it has the essential features

557
01:08:28,066 --> 01:08:33,993
and in spite of the fact it has been recorded as having the pathology which you are treating.

558
01:08:36,881 --> 01:08:40,969
Therefore this argument is not valid.

559
01:08:45,378 --> 01:08:50,698
The second argument that Puls. is not thirsty, is not true.

560
01:08:51,489 --> 01:08:57,361
It has been even recorded since in memorial that some times has extreme thirst.

561
01:08:59,649 --> 01:09:05,625
So these are not arguments to take away from Puls.

562
01:09:07,353 --> 01:09:09,658
– I have a reference. Enlarged spleen…

563
01:09:13,337 --> 01:09:14,089
- In Hering.

564
01:09:15,617 --> 01:09:16,873
Here you are!

565
01:09:18,594 --> 01:09:19,922
So what do you say now?

566
01:09:20,434 --> 01:09:22,466
Your argument is gone!

567
01:09:26,865 --> 01:09:31,489
– Is it true that it doesn’t the remedy that covers the whole picture

568
01:09:32,065 --> 01:09:35,321
doesn’t cover the full pathology if pathology isn’t far advanced?

569
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:38,490
I mean how far advanced is it?

570
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:40,474
It’s not destruction, is it?

571
01:09:41,746 --> 01:09:44,641
And I wanted to ask to her reaction to her father’s death

572
01:09:46,145 --> 01:09:51,641
because I still think possibly that there is a case you wouldn’t have given before Puls.

573
01:09:52,177 --> 01:09:55,153
because the grief and her reaction to this is much stronger.

574
01:09:55,730 --> 01:09:59,570
This may be a top layer. Puls. is maybe the next layer.

575
01:10:03,745 --> 01:10:06,937
– I have not very good relationship to my father.

576
01:10:07,441 --> 01:10:10,121
So his death was not a big problem for me.

577
01:10:14,914 --> 01:10:15,986
– You cried?

578
01:10:16,594 --> 01:10:22,225
– No. He was very strict and we had a bad relationship.

579
01:10:24,201 --> 01:10:25,569
It was not a problem.

580
01:10:28,578 --> 01:10:32,082
– That’s why she was attached to this man so much.

581
01:10:33,274 --> 01:10:41,842
The dog to whom she had a relationship tell me how much you cried about your dog…

582
01:10:42,401 --> 01:10:49,562
- I cried, I was really sick, I was really depressed, I needed Ign. and I cried for about 2 weeks.

583
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:51,890
It was terrible.

584
01:10:59,449 --> 01:11:10,969
– Sometimes it happens with the very strict parents.

585
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:19,665
They’re too strict and the children severe the relationship.

586
01:11:20,690 --> 01:11:25,169
Because the parents didn’t know the natural tenderness and affection

587
01:11:26,057 --> 01:11:33,280
which is due to the children and therefore the children become rebellious and many times

588
01:11:34,792 --> 01:11:47,192
they go to find other avenues of satisfaction which are today the drugs every youngster

589
01:11:48,656 --> 01:11:51,128
is grabbing.

590
01:11:53,576 --> 01:12:04,272
What is interesting in this case is the way she says she reacted to this particular stress.

591
01:12:07,184 --> 01:12:13,608
She says she meditates to find out. Puls. is a mild individual.

592
01:12:14,385 --> 01:12:17,193
Is not violent.

593
01:12:17,585 --> 01:12:25,369
Even when Puls. becomes violent it is manipulative violence.

594
01:12:29,392 --> 01:12:30,936
What do I mean?

595
01:12:31,768 --> 01:12:33,656
I’ve described before.

596
01:12:34,425 --> 01:12:42,688
Puls. wants attention and she doesn’t have the attention she needs and protection.

597
01:12:43,512 --> 01:12:52,024
She feels neglected all the time and in order to create attention she may become violent

598
01:12:52,577 --> 01:12:53,866
but what kind of violence?

599
01:12:55,121 --> 01:13:03,240
They will take this and there is the man and she throws this there.

600
01:13:03,952 --> 01:13:05,224
Not to hit me!

601
01:13:06,344 --> 01:13:09,072
Will never throw it on the man!

602
01:13:10,265 --> 01:13:18,161
Will just throw it next to him to show how upset I am.

603
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:25,472
This is what we call manipulation of Puls.

604
01:13:27,929 --> 01:13:32,441
That means I am very angry, I want to attack you, you bloody bastard!

605
01:13:37,352 --> 01:13:42,032
She could just do this and smash his head but she will not do it.

606
01:13:42,857 --> 01:13:45,241
It’s not violent.

607
01:13:46,433 --> 01:13:57,545
Is very sweet, easygoing, very easy to persuade etc. exactly as she describes.

608
01:13:58,312 --> 01:14:01,048
With the aversion to pork you don’t need almost anything else!

609
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:18,017
Of course the fact that she says I am under grief the mind could go to Nat-m.

610
01:14:18,881 --> 01:14:21,737
Then you say Nat-m. is not aggravated by sun?

611
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:26,856
Yes it is, Puls. also. But Nat-m. is a cold remedy?

612
01:14:27,568 --> 01:14:29,480
No, it’s also a hot remedy.

613
01:14:31,753 --> 01:14:39,497
But the desire for fresh air is characteristic more of Puls. than Nat-m.

614
01:14:40,145 --> 01:14:42,240
The aversion to fat belongs to both.

615
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:48,768
But where is the desire for salt to support a Nat-m.?

616
01:14:50,032 --> 01:14:56,184
I’ve changed and my change is that I need salty sardines.

617
01:14:56,777 --> 01:15:05,378
If she had told me that I would say yes, Nat-m. Just because of the desire for salt.

618
01:15:06,088 --> 01:15:09,576
Here we have this mild person.

619
01:15:10,705 --> 01:15:15,073
But is this cold?

620
01:15:15,681 --> 01:15:18,104
It is because she is anemic.

621
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:29,288
It’s symptom of her pathology to be cold. Anybody who is very anemic is cold.

622
01:15:30,625 --> 01:15:33,032
But I didn’t hear anybody telling me that.

623
01:15:36,128 --> 01:15:38,152
– You knew it!

624
01:15:39,176 --> 01:15:47,801
– Yes, but are arguing. Puls. has to be hot and she’s not hot, she’s very cold etc.

625
01:15:49,449 --> 01:15:56,560
But when you go to her pathology… find me an anemic person who is hot.

626
01:15:58,432 --> 01:16:00,144
It’s not possible.

627
01:16:01,001 --> 01:16:05,065
So it is pathognomonic to her pathology.

628
01:16:05,873 --> 01:16:12,144
That’s why you don’t see the aggravation from heat but when it comes to the point

629
01:16:12,624 --> 01:16:18,664
where the heat, the sun… forget it, I cannot stand one minute.

630
01:16:22,145 --> 01:16:24,465
So you have to have an anemic remedy.

631
01:16:24,833 --> 01:16:26,296
Which is it?

632
01:16:27,344 --> 01:16:29,320
What is the problem?

633
01:16:30,104 --> 01:16:32,048
Actually very little problem.

634
01:16:32,664 --> 01:16:44,880
The only problem I accepted is the desire for warm (drinks) but even that has been recorded in Puls.

635
01:16:47,504 --> 01:16:51,992
Therefore Puls. 12C 3 times daily.

636
01:16:54,905 --> 01:16:56,521
Thank you!

637
01:16:59,977 --> 01:17:02,000
He doesn’t like my prescription.

638
01:17:03,472 --> 01:17:08,752
– I’ve a question. Do you think it would be likely she might need Med. later on?

639
01:17:10,296 --> 01:17:11,888
How would you decide that?

640
01:17:12,648 --> 01:17:15,208
– Maybe, maybe not.

641
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:19,232
Maybe she will not need the Med.

642
01:17:20,744 --> 01:17:29,032
What is conducive for her at this moment is the temperature

643
01:17:30,713 --> 01:17:34,609
which is the optimum for her blood.

644
01:17:41,232 --> 01:17:46,832
Her blood has such a composition that this temperature suits better the organism

645
01:17:47,809 --> 01:17:49,745
and that’s why she feels better.

646
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:53,081
Did you go to swim?

647
01:17:56,328 --> 01:17:57,816
You felt good?

648
01:17:58,592 --> 01:18:00,258
You liked it.

649
01:18:10,593 --> 01:18:15,984
– What sign will you look for if she doesn’t move with the 12C?

650
01:18:16,449 --> 01:18:19,193
And you either want to give a higher potency or change the medicine.

651
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:25,528
What will make you decide to push the potency higher or to alter maybe to Nat-m. or Med.?

652
01:18:26,081 --> 01:18:27,968
– I will try a higher potency yes.

653
01:18:28,673 --> 01:18:35,880
I will try first, if it doesn’t move at all, let us say within a month there is no change,

654
01:18:36,608 --> 01:18:40,440
because with this low potency we expect later the results.

655
01:18:41,321 --> 01:18:44,313
We expect the results to start after a month.

656
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:46,616
What will be the results?

657
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:50,296
The first thing she will feel is more energy.

658
01:18:51,392 --> 01:18:58,424
That means if the blood starts being better the energy will rise.

659
01:18:59,729 --> 01:19:04,440
So if she sees a rise in the energy cause this is what is lacking mostly

660
01:19:05,112 --> 01:19:08,616
that means the production of the blood is of a better quality

661
01:19:09,144 --> 01:19:10,738
and of a better quantity perhaps.

662
01:19:11,744 --> 01:19:13,497
Therefore she will continue.

663
01:19:14,504 --> 01:19:20,032
So, I believe within 3-4 months the energy level will be quite high.

664
01:19:20,696 --> 01:19:30,353
If in 3-4 months there is no change then I will try the higher potency 200C,

665
01:19:30,984 --> 01:19:36,088
in case there is no change then I will try a dose of Nat-m.

666
01:19:38,217 --> 01:19:46,715
and if there is no change then I will try Med. And if there is no change I will try Ferr.

667
01:19:47,747 --> 01:20:05,971
And if there is change from Puls., I believe she will finally go to Sil. So instead of Sil. -> Puls.

668
01:20:06,467 --> 01:20:25,033
it will be Puls. -> Sil. Another secret I will tell you;

669
01:20:27,450 --> 01:20:33,754
don’t be in a hurry to change the remedies.

670
01:20:34,993 --> 01:20:37,921
Once you have studied a case so much and so thoroughly

671
01:20:38,378 --> 01:20:46,569
and so deep you better stick to this remedy and don’t change…

672
01:20:46,802 --> 01:20:50,514
There’s no effect, give another remedy, then you confuse the case.

673
01:20:52,281 --> 01:20:57,209
– I just want to ask is it possible to change the potency of Chin., continue Chin.?

674
01:20:58,545 --> 01:21:09,258
– There is a possibility that in case after Puls. there is an improvement

675
01:21:10,321 --> 01:21:15,257
and at a certain period after a year there is a big bleeding

676
01:21:16,097 --> 01:21:19,313
and this big bleeding cannot be controlled by Puls.

677
01:21:20,034 --> 01:21:25,178
Most probably maybe go back to Chin. where she will need

678
01:21:25,617 --> 01:21:34,130
a dose of Chin. 200C or 1M to counteract the bleeding and then go back again to Puls.

679
01:21:36,489 --> 01:21:41,617
You see there are different possibilities which we cannot predict beforehand.

680
01:21:42,809 --> 01:21:44,218
It’s not possible.

681
01:21:45,970 --> 01:21:51,081
– What I wanted to say and I forgot; since about 10 years I’m taking chemical drugs Ferrum.

682
01:21:53,865 --> 01:22:03,465
And Puls. is a remedy for abuse of taking Ferrum for long time.

683
01:22:04,433 --> 01:22:09,201
– And since you are taking Ferrum you have to control your blood

684
01:22:10,105 --> 01:22:14,713
and see if your blood count, the hemoglobin improves

685
01:22:16,098 --> 01:22:21,873
then you can reduce he Ferrum until you almost take it out.

686
01:22:28,369 --> 01:22:32,081
“Chlorotic girls”, was the old term.

687
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:47,377
It’s a wonder that nobody gave her Puls. because she was feeling cold.

688
01:22:48,730 --> 01:22:50,434
That was the main reason.

689
01:22:50,938 --> 01:22:53,801
Nobody thought that this is because of her pathology.

690
01:22:55,185 --> 01:22:59,737
If it is pathognomonic of her pathology you can’t help it.

691
01:23:02,257 --> 01:23:15,377
Let’s say you get somebody with diabetes mellitus and you have a very high degree of thirst.

692
01:23:17,273 --> 01:23:20,425
Can’t you give a thirstless remedy?

693
01:23:20,977 --> 01:23:24,553
Of course you can give a thirstless remedy because it’s the pathology

694
01:23:25,154 --> 01:23:28,858
which creates the need for water.

695
01:23:31,705 --> 01:23:35,337
Of course you can give Puls. in diabetes mellitus

696
01:23:36,281 --> 01:23:38,953
in spite of the fact that there is a lot of thirst.

697
01:23:43,202 --> 01:23:45,410
It’s as easy as that.

698
01:23:49,113 --> 01:23:53,097
– I was wondering about the pathognomonic symptoms but there are other

699
01:23:53,449 --> 01:23:56,009
pathognomonic symptoms that we took in the case like the weakness

700
01:23:56,514 --> 01:23:58,739
which is an obvious symptom of anemia and other symptoms.

701
01:23:59,730 --> 01:24:03,529
So, if you feel like talking about the differentiation when you take a symptom

702
01:24:04,353 --> 01:24:08,809
that is pathognomonic obviously and you can’t or you don’t rely on it…

703
01:24:10,129 --> 01:24:15,457
- We did not prescribe Puls. because of weakness.

704
01:24:16,306 --> 01:24:28,354
If I have said I give Puls. because of her weakness or, in a different way,

705
01:24:29,049 --> 01:24:32,585
I give Stan. because of her weakness.

706
01:24:33,090 --> 01:24:39,793
That would be wrong. If I had prescribed Stan. or Ph-ac. because of her weakness

707
01:24:40,617 --> 01:24:43,913
this is wrong because as you say this is pathognomonic,

708
01:24:44,658 --> 01:24:50,946
you make take into consideration in your repertorization because these remedies…

709
01:24:51,898 --> 01:24:56,505
You see all anemic remedies will produce weakness there is no question.

710
01:24:57,217 --> 01:25:04,281
You can take it into repertorization but you cannot say because of weakness.

711
01:25:06,081 --> 01:25:10,897
But you can say I give her because she is soft, mild, crying,

712
01:25:12,354 --> 01:25:18,961
desire open air in spite of the fact she’s s cold and aversion pork and fat.

713
01:25:19,739 --> 01:25:23,898
Because of these I give Puls. because all these are not pathognomonic,

714
01:25:24,674 --> 01:25:31,849
they are the characteristics of her remedy.
