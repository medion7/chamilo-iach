1
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:29,436
Heavy menstruation. Very heavy.

2
00:00:33,548 --> 00:00:37,132
– Heavy with a lot of blood?
– A lot of blood.

3
00:00:37,388 --> 00:00:43,575
– What type of blood?
– There are 2 kinds.

4
00:00:43,824 --> 00:00:58,170
It’s the normal blood and also this very thick clots and it is so much of it.

5
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:09,424
I have very rich for at least 5 days and totally the menses go on for 13 days.

6
00:01:11,784 --> 00:01:16,385
So I got very tired.

7
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:24,065
– Most probably you have been examined by gynecologists.

8
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:32,826
What is your specialty? Are you a M.D.?
– No, I am a massage therapist.

9
00:01:33,344 --> 00:01:36,420
– And you have been examined by gynecologist?

10
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:57,410
– No. This started... not so long ago. It started at least one year ago.

11
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:17,380
I protect myself from getting pregnant and then I had this spiral.

12
00:02:17,626 --> 00:02:26,486
– When did you use this spiral? 1,5 year ago?

13
00:02:26,586 --> 00:02:37,866
– The first time was is 1997.
– 3 years ago. But the bleeding is...

14
00:02:38,135 --> 00:02:42,886
- It must be for about 1,5 year. Nearly 2 years.

15
00:02:42,986 --> 00:02:46,826
– So it is not due to the spiral. You don’t think it is due to it.

16
00:02:47,095 --> 00:02:50,425
– I think it is because it started then.

17
00:02:50,935 --> 00:02:58,297
I had this first spiral in 1997 and this heavy bleeding started.

18
00:02:58,546 --> 00:03:06,226
After 2 years I took it out and the bleeding went on. I didn’t get normal again.

19
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:11,951
– That means now you don’t have this spiral.
– No.

20
00:03:12,227 --> 00:03:20,146
– And the bleeding continues but it started 3 years ago after the spiral.

21
00:03:20,418 --> 00:03:25,266
– When I had the spiral. Then I took it out.

22
00:03:27,064 --> 00:03:39,864
It got a little bit better after a time and then I tried another spiral and then it got worse at once.

23
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:58,824
And I got this problem with migraine my whole life. But it’s much better nowadays.

24
00:03:58,824 --> 00:04:07,543
– How is that better?
– It’s better for about 3 years at least.

25
00:04:10,344 --> 00:04:19,968
I took out my amalgam 3 years ago and everything got much better. Eczema also.

26
00:04:20,068 --> 00:04:25,268
– But these headaches started at what age?

27
00:04:28,344 --> 00:04:37,968
– I had it since I was 22 or something.

28
00:04:38,068 --> 00:04:54,085
– Why did they start?
– I don’t know. So I took all the amalgam out.

29
00:04:54,185 --> 00:05:17,225
– At what age?
– It was somewhere in the 80s I took it out. Perhaps 30 years.

30
00:05:18,505 --> 00:05:27,224
- And the headaches continued...
- After that it started to go better.

31
00:05:27,988 --> 00:05:35,414
– But really better it got 3 years ago.
– Yes. It was gone for quite a long time.

32
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:41,814
But it comes sometimes with these heavy menses,

33
00:05:42,068 --> 00:05:53,065
before the menstruation and 3 days while the menstruation has started.

34
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:59,988
– So every time you have the menstruation the headache also comes before the menstruation?

35
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:06,134
– Sometimes it doesn’t come.
– Most of the times it comes.

36
00:06:08,975 --> 00:06:15,585
And what is the form of these headaches?

37
00:06:15,824 --> 00:06:22,676
– I got my menstruation now, when I am here and also had the headache,

38
00:06:22,776 --> 00:06:35,062
I take some pills because otherwise I can’t be here but it starts feeling as if I have a helmet,

39
00:06:35,586 --> 00:06:44,305
like cotton in my head all over and then it concentrates on the neck

40
00:06:44,577 --> 00:06:52,772
and this time is on the right side and goes up in the head like a needle in the eye.

41
00:06:53,026 --> 00:06:58,146
Sometimes on the left but mostly on the right I think.

42
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:00,452
– And it starts on the back?

43
00:07:00,606 --> 00:07:06,588
– Yes I have very tense muscles here in me shoulder and my neck.

44
00:07:06,688 --> 00:07:14,017
– And the headache is such that it can make you vomit?

45
00:07:15,297 --> 00:07:35,012
– No, I don’t throw up. All my energy is totally gone and you can do like that I will fall.

46
00:07:35,266 --> 00:07:37,057
– Exhaustion during the headache.

47
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:51,906
– Yes. I can hardly stand up and do things. I feel totally empty.

48
00:07:52,697 --> 00:08:00,108
– And if you don’t take medicine you have to lie down?
– Yes.

49
00:08:00,277 --> 00:08:04,086
– You have to take medicine every time?
– When it’s heavy I do.

50
00:08:04,186 --> 00:08:18,544
Otherwise I just try like this. Aspirin, no stronger things.
– Anything else?

51
00:08:18,785 --> 00:08:24,944
– I have these eczemas since I was a child.
– Where?

52
00:08:25,185 --> 00:08:31,095
– Now or back in time?
- Back and now.

53
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:40,304
– As a child I had in my arms and back of the knees

54
00:08:40,545 --> 00:08:54,805
and then in teenage I had very much on my hands and for some period I had it around my face, my lips,

55
00:08:54,905 --> 00:08:58,745
but that was a short time.

56
00:08:58,986 --> 00:09:11,784
And when I was 30 years old I had very much on my hands all the time

57
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:17,348
and it was very difficult with my children.

58
00:09:18,628 --> 00:09:24,538
I also used very much cortisone.

59
00:09:25,028 --> 00:09:35,027
– Do you remember at what age the eczema started? You don’t have to be very accurate.

60
00:09:41,427 --> 00:09:50,903
– Perhaps from 10 to teenage.

61
00:09:51,144 --> 00:09:59,347
– And the headaches started at about 23. 10 years later.

62
00:09:59,588 --> 00:10:07,027
In the meantime when eczema was the worst? What age?

63
00:10:07,268 --> 00:10:14,184
– In the 30s. When I was 30-32...

64
00:10:30,052 --> 00:10:41,308
- 30 and onwards it was worse the most of it. The children were small.

65
00:10:41,572 --> 00:10:45,905
– When did it become less? At what age?

66
00:10:49,745 --> 00:11:16,945
– It started when I took out the amalgam then it got better... I don’t know. About 1982.

67
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:37,597
– So you were 32 by that time.
– And then years go and everything goes better, eczema and the migraine.

68
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:42,126
– And you use cortisone ointment?

69
00:11:42,226 --> 00:11:51,123
–I had done that when I was a child and when I was growing up.

70
00:11:51,223 --> 00:11:54,424
– When you were 30 and the eczema was bad did you use cortisone?

71
00:11:54,704 --> 00:12:04,425
– No, I did not because I met the anthroposophical medicine when I was about 20.

72
00:12:04,664 --> 00:12:09,545
So I tried not to use cortisone.

73
00:12:09,789 --> 00:12:15,694
– But they gave you anthroposophical medicine.
– Yes, but didn’t help.

74
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:23,107
– So you think the amalgam helped you.

75
00:12:23,907 --> 00:12:33,378
–Yes. I have that feeling because when I took that out things happened.

76
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:41,451
– No do you have any salivation during sleep?

77
00:12:41,551 --> 00:12:49,783
–No. I wake up with dry eyes. Not every morning, but it is often.

78
00:12:50,298 --> 00:13:01,544
And I like to drink water in the night. A little sip.

79
00:13:01,718 --> 00:13:09,124
– What else you suffer from?

80
00:13:09,224 --> 00:13:20,918
– Now when I have these heavy menses I also have cramps in my rectum,

81
00:13:21,018 --> 00:13:29,704
uterus and bladder the 2-3 first days of the menses.

82
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:43,268
It’s so heavy that I have cramp. It’s quite new, I didn’t have that before.

83
00:13:43,543 --> 00:13:46,267
– What was the last remedy that you took?

84
00:13:46,531 --> 00:13:53,424
– I haven’t had any remedy. I’m totally clean!

85
00:13:53,947 --> 00:14:02,661
I am excited to see what you can do!

86
00:14:02,907 --> 00:14:09,725
I have taken twice some pills for this heavy bleeding,

87
00:14:09,825 --> 00:14:12,131
otherwise I couldn’t be here.

88
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:25,424
Perhaps it is important to know; tranexamic acid.

89
00:14:25,947 --> 00:14:34,341
That’s something that makes the bleeding less.

90
00:14:35,105 --> 00:14:48,931
– The blood from menses is thin or there are clots?
– Very big clots.

91
00:14:49,085 --> 00:14:55,586
– But at the same time the blood itself is like normal or thinner?

92
00:14:55,825 --> 00:15:06,226
– Perhaps thinner.
– Do you have any leucorrhea after menses?

93
00:15:10,307 --> 00:15:20,547
– No. The menses has difficulties to stop completely.

94
00:15:20,822 --> 00:15:31,826
It seems to stop and then it comes a little bit more for a few days or week and then it’s completely stopped.

95
00:15:33,047 --> 00:15:35,863
– Did you have an abortion in your life?

96
00:15:36,109 --> 00:15:49,178
– Yes, I had. I had in 1986, 1987 induced abortion.

97
00:15:57,864 --> 00:16:14,263
In December 1999 spontaneous abortion that was one week after I after expecting my menses.

98
00:16:14,703 --> 00:16:32,548
– Can you describe this condition for me? What is the feeling of the cramp? Is there pain?

99
00:16:32,823 --> 00:16:43,895
– Where I go on the toilet and the stool is coming it hurts.
– The rectum feels cramped.

100
00:16:44,144 --> 00:16:49,264
– Yes, when the stool is coming the uterus cramps and I try to relax.

101
00:16:49,405 --> 00:16:56,185
– And there is a pain or no pain?
– A little pain.

102
00:16:56,326 --> 00:17:02,906
– But what about the cramps in the bladder?

103
00:17:03,696 --> 00:17:13,421
You feel the uterus, the rectum and the bladder all cramped.

104
00:17:13,664 --> 00:17:25,730
– I don’t know if it hurts. Of course, I feel it but it’s not painful.

105
00:17:28,026 --> 00:17:45,184
I have to concentrate on relaxing. One week before menses I sweat a lot in the night.

106
00:17:51,828 --> 00:18:07,188
I also get loose stool 1-2 days before menses so I know it is coming.

107
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:20,770
I like eat more food before menses.

108
00:18:21,024 --> 00:18:32,544
I have more appetite and I don’t feel when it is enough.

109
00:18:32,788 --> 00:18:41,250
This is just before menses the other days I don’t feel hungry so much.

110
00:18:50,210 --> 00:19:04,026
– What would you like to eat?
– I don’t crave anything special. I don’t eat meat.

111
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:23,226
– What do you like best?
– Perhaps a little bit heavy food.

112
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:35,095
I love salad but I can’t live on it.
– You say you don’t eat meat but you like heavy food.

113
00:19:35,344 --> 00:19:57,104
– Pasta and some nice vegetable sauce that’s heavy for me. Augbergine, tomato, garlic.

114
00:19:57,345 --> 00:20:05,546
– Can you eat the fat of meat?
– No. I don’t like it.

115
00:20:05,815 --> 00:20:15,545
– Not at all? You take it out?
– Yes, I take it out.

116
00:20:24,746 --> 00:20:36,266
– Before menses I get irritated. I get easily angry and so.

117
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:48,304
I love to sleep on the back with my hand over the head. I love thunderstorms.

118
00:20:53,165 --> 00:21:08,266
– What else can you say?
– When I am sleeping, I am grinding teeth.

119
00:21:08,535 --> 00:21:15,424
– Did anybody tell you that?
– I feel it. I’m very tired in my teeth.

120
00:21:15,668 --> 00:21:20,544
– Your husband who was sleeping with you he was telling you, you are grinding your teeth?

121
00:21:20,788 --> 00:21:30,464
– No, he is snoring so he doesn’t know.
– Are you sure you grind your teeth.

122
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:41,744
– I feel it because I am tired in my teeth.
– You think you are grinding your teeth.

123
00:21:42,265 --> 00:22:08,624
– Perhaps I am pressing more than grinding. I feel I have been pushing them in the night.

124
00:22:13,744 --> 00:22:22,704
And I have difficulties to feel when my own strength is gone.

125
00:22:22,845 --> 00:22:32,426
I work easily too hard till it’s too late.
– Next?

126
00:22:32,695 --> 00:22:43,946
– I’m scared of heights. When I look over the edge it feels like needles in my legs.

127
00:22:44,164 --> 00:22:59,065
– How do you feel emotionally?
– Good. I am happy.

128
00:22:59,306 --> 00:23:06,745
– You have no specific problem.
– No, my life is good now.

129
00:23:07,006 --> 00:23:17,261
– Are you worried about your children?
– I think I’m normal mother.

130
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:34,326
– In general you feel cold or hot?
– Sensitive to draft.

131
00:23:34,426 --> 00:23:41,901
I get easily tense in my neck and it goes further with headache.

132
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:51,104
When there’s this migraine I’m very hot in my head.

133
00:23:51,376 --> 00:23:59,546
It feels like fever and the hands can be cold and the feet feel cold.

134
00:24:01,906 --> 00:24:09,547
I have cold hands now, I have a headache.

135
00:24:09,786 --> 00:24:17,466
here’s another bog problem; always when I eat my stomach gets swollen.

136
00:24:19,726 --> 00:24:25,664
Every day, all the time and I’m so fed up of it.

137
00:24:25,736 --> 00:24:27,784
–After eating?
– Yes.

138
00:24:28,028 --> 00:24:31,625
– If you eat breakfast it will happen?

139
00:24:31,864 --> 00:24:43,664
– It’s ok but lunch I can be swollen up until late in the evening.

140
00:24:48,265 --> 00:25:02,584
When I eat bread, garlic and cucumber and some vegetables... That’s worse.

141
00:25:02,864 --> 00:25:11,524
– Which are your worst hours?
– About my stomach?

142
00:25:11,624 --> 00:25:20,976
– No, in general. If that time comes I always feel tired, not well...

143
00:25:21,227 --> 00:25:32,496
- From the afternoon and further. Perhaps until 18.00.

144
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:43,744
- Which is your best time?
– It’s in the morning and before lunch.

145
00:25:44,016 --> 00:25:48,621
– When you wake up in the morning you feel good after sleep,

146
00:25:48,864 --> 00:25:56,301
refreshed or you wake up unrefreshed, tired and after half an hour you feel good?

147
00:25:56,544 --> 00:25:58,861
– I feel mostly good.

148
00:25:59,004 --> 00:26:10,381
I feel best when I know I’m free but when I need to go to work I’m heavier in the morning.

149
00:26:10,624 --> 00:26:18,061
But generally I think I am fresh in the morning.

150
00:26:19,584 --> 00:26:42,896
One more thing about my menses; the breast is swollen before menses, 2 days before it is worse.

151
00:26:48,424 --> 00:26:53,537
– The fear of height is very strong?

152
00:26:54,052 --> 00:27:04,013
– Yes. I go out and look over the edge on a high balcony there’s like needles in my legs.

153
00:27:05,293 --> 00:27:16,577
– But very high like tenth floor. What about third floor?
– No, that’s ok.

154
00:27:18,865 --> 00:27:28,904
– You said you like thunderstorm but do you feel better in thunderstorm or you just like to watch?

155
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:33,263
Or you feel good as if the air is refreshing you?

156
00:27:33,506 --> 00:27:40,173
– I don’t need to go out to the thunders but I like to be at home and it’s stormy outside.

157
00:27:40,424 --> 00:27:51,593
– Why? Your organism feels good or you like it as a phenomenon?
– I feel good.

158
00:27:51,693 --> 00:28:05,773
– Without affecting your organism? Are you happier?
– Perhaps. I don’t know.

159
00:28:09,613 --> 00:28:15,503
– How is your sexual drive?
– It’s good.

160
00:28:15,662 --> 00:28:26,297
– Very good or excessively good?
– It’s very good. I am happy now in life, really.

161
00:28:26,546 --> 00:28:38,582
– Before menses you have more desire?
– No, less desire before menses.

162
00:28:40,077 --> 00:28:43,848
– During menses?
– No.

163
00:28:43,948 --> 00:28:52,814
– After menses?
– Yes. Shall I say something about my history,

164
00:28:53,065 --> 00:29:06,784
I don’t know if it’s important but all my life until about 3 years I always had a feeling of forsaken

165
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:15,226
and I always felt outside but that’s not anymore.

166
00:29:16,506 --> 00:29:40,826
–How did this feeling go away?
– Now I am studying in Stockholm Psychosynthesis.

167
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:43,457
– Assagioli?
– You know him!

168
00:29:43,708 --> 00:29:50,626
– I know everything! Hahah...

169
00:30:03,665 --> 00:30:15,185
The difficulty in your case which brings a state of paralysis...

170
00:30:15,357 --> 00:30:23,137
- This is important because these studies with Assagioli have changed very much.

171
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:44,132
I am grounded in myself and I don’t have that feeling anymore and I am being educated to be therapist.

172
00:30:53,285 --> 00:31:11,012
Another thing, as a child and up to 21 years old I was clairvoyant

173
00:31:11,777 --> 00:31:28,145
and then it went away but I still have this very strong intuition, feel things before happening.

174
00:31:28,417 --> 00:31:39,172
I can very easily listen to my patients and I listen behind, I don’t how to express...

175
00:31:40,782 --> 00:31:47,897
I still have that.
– You listen and you understand.

176
00:31:48,146 --> 00:31:54,467
– I understand and I know more than they are saying.

177
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:02,937
– You have any problem going into a lift?
– No.

178
00:32:04,707 --> 00:32:16,827
–Going down or up.
– No. I am a bit worried about my eyes.

179
00:32:17,345 --> 00:32:33,505
I see worse year by year. I have cataract and astigmatism.

180
00:32:33,744 --> 00:32:45,816
– Do you like fruits?
– I like them but I don’t crave them. I prefer orange juice.

181
00:32:46,306 --> 00:32:53,886
– From all fruits?
– If I have apples and oranges I take oranges.

182
00:32:53,986 --> 00:33:02,222
– But from all fruits which would you like best?

183
00:33:02,465 --> 00:33:16,545
– Orange. Strawberries. But they are not so good for my stomach.

184
00:33:16,812 --> 00:33:25,787
– But you like oranges which are sour?
– A little bit sourer.

185
00:33:26,083 --> 00:33:39,941
– Would you say you like unripe, green fruits?

186
00:33:45,061 --> 00:33:51,871
– If you do physical exercise do you feel easily exhausted

187
00:33:51,971 --> 00:33:56,217
or on the contrary physical exercise makes you feel better?

188
00:33:56,466 --> 00:34:02,617
– It makes me feel better. I love long walks.

189
00:34:02,866 --> 00:34:15,666
– And you walk fast or slowly?
– Medium. If I go very fast I get tired.

190
00:34:18,226 --> 00:34:24,108
– But you like dancing?
– Yes, I like dancing.

191
00:34:24,377 --> 00:34:36,662
– Do you feel good after dancing?
– Yes, I feel good. Do you know eurhythmy?

192
00:34:37,177 --> 00:34:46,137
– Yeah, sure! I said I know everything but what is this question?

193
00:34:48,424 --> 00:34:55,863
You have cramps on your bladder.

194
00:34:56,004 --> 00:35:04,307
– It feels like cramps, it’s difficult to urinate.

195
00:35:05,378 --> 00:35:16,626
When the urine comes there are cramps. But this is new for me I haven’t had it before.

196
00:35:16,898 --> 00:35:30,706
– Just one time?
– No, I have it since a few months now.

197
00:35:31,224 --> 00:35:42,991
– Without taking any medicine, any remedy?
– No. I don’t like medicines.

198
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:57,858
– Do you have a kind of fear of taking medicines or you just don’t like drugs etc.?

199
00:35:59,384 --> 00:36:03,471
– I have a fear of chemical drugs, yes.

200
00:36:03,767 --> 00:36:08,278
I have been taking anthroposophical medicine without problem

201
00:36:08,378 --> 00:36:14,263
and this is very interesting for me to have some homeopathic medicines.

202
00:36:14,504 --> 00:36:18,244
– But you have no problem taking a homeopathic remedy?

203
00:36:18,344 --> 00:36:31,327
– I am a little bit wondering.
– Whether you are going to take the remedy?

204
00:36:31,427 --> 00:36:34,744
– I will take the remedy!

205
00:36:37,114 --> 00:36:42,665
– When you sleep, you said you sleep only on your back?

206
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:48,054
– When I have my menses I sleep on the side.
– Which side?

207
00:36:48,586 --> 00:36:51,385
– It depends on the headache. Now it’s on the right.

208
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,735
Because I have to sleep on the side that hurts.

209
00:36:54,986 --> 00:37:03,695
Push the pillow up here and then I sleep on the right and take the knee up.

210
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:13,045
Otherwise on the back with my hands over the head.

211
00:37:13,145 --> 00:37:26,986
It’s lovely like this! I want my feet covered.

212
00:37:27,225 --> 00:37:29,028
– Always?
– Yes.

213
00:37:29,308 --> 00:37:33,668
– You never stick them out of covers?
– Never!

214
00:37:33,907 --> 00:37:38,265
– Are you afraid of animals?

215
00:37:38,512 --> 00:37:49,028
– I am afraid of one kind of dog because when I was a child one dog bit me on the leg.

216
00:37:49,267 --> 00:38:05,292
– Ferocious dogs.
– Yes, shepherd dogs.

217
00:38:05,392 --> 00:38:14,928
It was a police dog and it was a little bit mad. I drink a lot of water.

218
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:22,505
– You sip it?
– Yes.

219
00:38:22,774 --> 00:38:28,905
– All the time you like to drink but not too much?

220
00:38:29,585 --> 00:38:37,225
– It varies. I drink a lot of water because sometimes I really want it,

221
00:38:37,325 --> 00:38:46,454
otherwise I drink because I think it’s healthy. But now I am thirsty.

222
00:38:46,949 --> 00:39:01,545
– But when you drink, the natural tendency for you is to drink small quantities?
– Yes.

223
00:39:01,814 --> 00:39:06,665
– And frequently?
– Yes.

224
00:39:08,214 --> 00:39:13,588
– What about perspiration? Do you perspire in your sleep?

225
00:39:13,829 --> 00:39:19,224
– Only before menses. Yes, I sweat all over.

226
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:27,668
– Before menses in sleep?
– Yes, but I wake up in the night.

227
00:39:27,884 --> 00:39:36,780
When I am exercising I don’t feel good when I am sweating.

228
00:39:39,588 --> 00:39:51,375
– Do you think you are a restless person? You like to be active?

229
00:39:52,140 --> 00:40:00,068
You seem to be calm but this is out of training or natural.

230
00:40:00,335 --> 00:40:04,175
– I think I am calm.

231
00:40:07,748 --> 00:40:21,305
– Do you have acute conditions like bronchitis or influenzas?

232
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,865
– In general?
– Yes.

233
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:34,628
– No, very seldom. Except the migraine, no.

234
00:40:40,828 --> 00:40:45,900
– Do you like fish?
– Yes.

235
00:40:46,148 --> 00:40:50,745
– Salt?
– I take salt, normal.

236
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:58,948
– Sweets?
– I like them but I don’t crave them. Before menses I eat some.

237
00:40:59,215 --> 00:41:03,055
– What about your nails? Are they strong?
– No, they are not strong?

238
00:41:03,366 --> 00:41:04,906
– Soft?
– Yes.

239
00:41:05,145 --> 00:41:07,980
– Brittle? They break easily?
– Yes.

240
00:41:08,228 --> 00:41:25,625
– Do you bite them?
– Sometimes. And the panaritium is always broken like this.

241
00:41:28,708 --> 00:41:35,626
– And you take them out like this?
– Yes, sometimes because they are broken.

242
00:41:35,865 --> 00:41:42,026
– Are they inflamed?
– No. Just dry and broken.

243
00:41:42,265 --> 00:42:02,645
And on my foot I easily get something like eczema between the toes. This one.

244
00:42:02,745 --> 00:42:09,145
– Now at this moment you have no eczema?

245
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:19,660
– I have here and here. But this is getting better here in Greece.

246
00:42:19,808 --> 00:42:23,500
In the summer and warmth.

247
00:42:51,152 --> 00:43:00,495
– During this period when you had this psychosynthesis

248
00:43:00,746 --> 00:43:05,866
 and the feeling of being forsaken went away,

249
00:43:06,105 --> 00:43:11,748
do you remember any other changes taking place in your organism?

250
00:43:17,625 --> 00:43:32,985
– Physically? I don’t know... I feel more in harmony and I feel I am me.

251
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:52,146
– What were you feeling before?
- I was always feeling out ship, forsaken.

252
00:43:53,465 --> 00:44:00,105
– Isolated, forsaken...

253
00:44:00,528 --> 00:44:12,148
- I got sad easily and scared that people would leave me and so.

254
00:44:13,944 --> 00:44:19,574
And that feeling I had all my life, since I was a little child.

255
00:44:21,108 --> 00:44:26,228
And I think it comes from my mother,

256
00:44:26,369 --> 00:44:31,589
she was living in stress and she was pregnant with me and didn’t really want me

257
00:44:31,864 --> 00:44:43,109
and she was giving birth to me alone, my father went away, left us.

258
00:44:43,384 --> 00:44:50,194
So, I think the feeling comes from when she was pregnant to me.

259
00:44:50,294 --> 00:44:57,144
– But your father left during that time and never came back?

260
00:45:00,709 --> 00:45:11,624
– Yes. Nowadays in my life it happens that I dream that I’m crying and I wake up.

261
00:45:11,868 --> 00:45:14,946
I don’t know if this is important.

262
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:18,386
– You see that you are crying but you are not really crying?

263
00:45:18,486 --> 00:45:31,492
– Yes, I cry in the dream and then I wake up and I am crying.
– And you don’t know why.

264
00:45:31,985 --> 00:45:42,748
– The story in the dream is always about me sometimes desperately looking for my husband

265
00:45:43,012 --> 00:45:52,988
and I can’t find him and sometimes it’s a story I don’t really remember,

266
00:45:53,252 --> 00:46:09,105
it’s about something I think I am going to be... Forsaken perhaps.

267
00:46:13,468 --> 00:46:19,106
– Do you work for somebody now or you work on your own?

268
00:46:19,345 --> 00:46:38,306
– Me and my husband work together with patients. He is a doctor.

269
00:46:43,577 --> 00:47:04,465
We have something like a small clinic with patients coming to us.

270
00:47:04,737 --> 00:47:12,737
– So you are doing a kind of Assagioli teaching, psychosynthesis...

271
00:47:12,888 --> 00:47:17,548
- Yes, I am being educated now, I am going to work with it.

272
00:47:17,717 --> 00:47:28,306
I am going in the school now. We will work with that with our patients also later.

273
00:47:28,557 --> 00:47:36,508
– Did you ever have any aphthae in the mouth?

274
00:47:42,146 --> 00:47:52,143
Like white spots in the mouth which are painful.
– No.

275
00:47:54,703 --> 00:47:59,548
– How do you feel in hot weather?

276
00:47:59,823 --> 00:48:08,264
I like Alonissos now but when you have the courses in July it’s too hot for me.

277
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:16,463
I can’t think, I can’t do anything. I feel I am swelling in the heat.

278
00:48:16,706 --> 00:48:22,344
– You retain water in your body.
– Yes, I think so.

279
00:48:22,588 --> 00:48:28,393
–What about cold? You feel happier in cold?

280
00:48:28,493 --> 00:48:35,906
– I like the Swedish winter when it’s a really nice, snowy, dry winter day

281
00:48:36,177 --> 00:48:44,086
but I could easily start to cry if I stand in the shower and the water gets too cold.

282
00:48:44,186 --> 00:48:54,692
Then I suddenly feel like crying. Then I need warm and nice water.

283
00:48:54,846 --> 00:48:57,745
I am very sensitive at that moment.

284
00:48:57,917 --> 00:49:02,008
– Do you have the need to be protected by your husband?

285
00:49:02,108 --> 00:49:11,587
– Yes, that’s a need I have. It was more before, now it’s still but it’s less.

286
00:49:11,862 --> 00:49:25,842
– Do you need to be consoled? If you want to have somebody to tell you don’t cry, to console you.

287
00:49:25,942 --> 00:49:40,786
– I need someone that sees me. That I am something, yes. That’s a need.

288
00:49:41,027 --> 00:49:51,788
– To have somebody giving you affection.
– Yes.

289
00:49:51,957 --> 00:50:00,748
– Do you understand the word consolation?
– Yes. I think so.

290
00:50:01,266 --> 00:50:05,868
– Do you need consolation when you are not feeling well?

291
00:50:06,137 --> 00:50:18,703
– No. I rather feel I need to be confirmed.

292
00:50:18,956 --> 00:50:31,223
I am happy with myself to be alone. I like to be alone.

293
00:50:31,388 --> 00:50:46,345
But also because of my childhood I have the strong feeling that no one really saw me.

294
00:50:50,424 --> 00:50:58,627
– Recognize.
– Yes.

295
00:51:00,887 --> 00:51:08,867
– Did you ever have any warts except of this eczema?
– Yes.

296
00:51:09,624 --> 00:51:14,254
– Do you remember how it went away?
– Burned.

297
00:51:14,505 --> 00:51:20,654
– Were they many? Do you remember?

298
00:51:20,905 --> 00:51:26,264
– When I was a child I had on my hands, I don’t know exactly where.

299
00:51:26,544 --> 00:51:38,574
And I had about 2-3 years ago on my small toe.

300
00:51:38,825 --> 00:51:41,904
– And you burned it?
– yes that one I burned.

301
00:51:43,504 --> 00:51:49,624
– Was it bleeding?
– No.

302
00:51:50,004 --> 00:51:55,785
– Anything else?
– No, I don’t think so.

303
00:51:56,024 --> 00:52:02,704
– Alright, let’s go outside.

304
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:16,784
First question that we are asking in this case.

305
00:52:17,027 --> 00:52:36,024
Is this a clear case? Who says yes? What is the remedy?

306
00:52:36,547 --> 00:52:52,664
Calc. Anybody else who has a good idea? Who says it’s a clear case?

307
00:52:52,944 --> 00:53:14,947
No one. Do you have any idea what remedy it might be? Puls. Thuja.

308
00:53:15,465 --> 00:53:29,294
Another Sep. I will write down here your ideas.

309
00:53:29,584 --> 00:53:59,747
Calc., Sep., Puls., Thuja., Med., Verat., Lyc. Another idea?

310
00:53:59,914 --> 00:54:36,105
Cupr., Nat-m. Who will be for Calc. 3. Sep.? 7. Puls.? 9.

311
00:54:36,244 --> 00:55:21,424
Thuja? 8. Med? 1. Verat.? 1 Lyc.? 2. Cupr.? 1, Nat-m.? 5. Cycl. 1.

312
00:55:28,034 --> 00:55:35,747
What you are seeing from the number of people, actually I don’t know your expertise

313
00:55:36,014 --> 00:55:44,184
but if this is a class of experts and these are the numbers, then we have a problem.

314
00:55:45,987 --> 00:55:58,264
Either the case is totally confused or the practitioners are.

315
00:56:00,334 --> 00:56:12,867
In this case what happens is both! Both the practitioners and the case are confused!

316
00:56:13,134 --> 00:56:19,024
And in spite of the fact she says; and this is the first thing we talk about,

317
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:24,654
whether the case is clear or not and she says I have not taken homeopathic remedies,

318
00:56:24,905 --> 00:56:28,884
she means she has not taken high potencies.

319
00:56:28,984 --> 00:56:36,588
She has taken anthrposophic medicine in which they are using perhaps 50 remedies

320
00:56:36,857 --> 00:56:42,988
and using them repeatedly which of course has an effect.

321
00:56:44,727 --> 00:56:49,144
The case started with a quite severe skin eruption,

322
00:56:49,385 --> 00:57:07,305
don’t forget that, which was treated with cortisone.

323
00:57:07,574 --> 00:57:13,705
What we see now is no skin eruption what you saw very little here,

324
00:57:13,974 --> 00:57:18,825
you cannot even consider it as skin eruption.

325
00:57:19,094 --> 00:57:28,054
That means all the skin eruption is inside now.

326
00:57:38,025 --> 00:57:47,065
The first thing we have to know is that if this case is doing well after 1, 2 or 3 remedies,

327
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:55,268
we have to see the skin eruption coming back.

328
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:10,105
This is really difficult but you have to tell your patient that if this happens

329
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:20,345
it is a successful treatment and you really hit the remedy!

330
00:58:20,868 --> 00:58:26,506
It depends whether she would like to take the remedy or not.

331
00:58:27,235 --> 00:58:39,055
The second is why this case is not clear. Do you know why?

332
00:58:42,895 --> 00:58:47,915
– Perhaps it’s because she did psychosynthesis.

333
00:58:48,015 --> 00:58:56,708
A lot of the symptoms went away with that and maybe we should start with that.

334
00:58:57,988 --> 00:59:03,626
– Why do you say that? Do you have a reason to say...

335
00:59:03,865 --> 00:59:12,825
- I think unless it’s a total deep cure to process,

336
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:22,585
if you take away some symptoms with whatever technique you still have to take them into account, maybe.

337
00:59:22,732 --> 00:59:29,232
– Again it is the same idea as I told you on different levels, we have different action.

338
00:59:29,508 --> 00:59:36,912
You can have upon your mind an action and you can change your mind.

339
00:59:37,427 --> 00:59:46,148
If this changing of the mind is not due to a total curative stimulus

340
00:59:46,387 --> 00:59:58,948
then you will only have a metathesis, a transformation.

341
01:00:04,579 --> 01:00:14,965
Let’s say here you have fear of being forsaken.

342
01:00:15,065 --> 01:00:25,305
She does psychosynthesis and this symptom goes away without changing the total picture.

343
01:00:25,552 --> 01:00:35,545
That means on this level this symptom has gone somewhere here

344
01:00:36,068 --> 01:00:52,708
and transformed itself into another symptom, another dimension. But within this level.

345
01:00:52,847 --> 01:01:02,986
Therefore we cannot consider it as a cure though the symptom is not there.

346
01:01:03,225 --> 01:01:07,588
In her particular case what we see?

347
01:01:07,855 --> 01:01:17,066
That this symptom has been transferred into a subconscious level.

348
01:01:19,865 --> 01:01:28,335
The symptom is not anymore in the awareness of the person, it is on the subconscious level.

349
01:01:28,598 --> 01:01:35,779
The moment she goes to sleep the subconscious takes over and the fears which are there

350
01:01:36,824 --> 01:01:43,224
they come through dreams and in her dream she has the same problem;

351
01:01:43,465 --> 01:01:50,629
she is afraid she is going to be forgotten by others.

352
01:01:51,204 --> 01:02:04,468
So actually this symptom is there but on a deeper level where she is not aware anymore.

353
01:02:04,784 --> 01:02:17,784
The question that we have as practitioners who are treating the whole person is such a transfer happens,

354
01:02:18,025 --> 01:02:26,228
do we have repercussions in other areas?

355
01:02:26,469 --> 01:02:33,188
And especially in the area in which this fear is moving.

356
01:02:34,227 --> 01:02:38,724
Has she lost something when she lost that symptom?

357
01:02:38,824 --> 01:02:48,823
Has she lost the ability to be more sensitive, to feel the pain of others?

358
01:02:53,178 --> 01:02:59,304
Here we don’t know. And it’s difficult to find out.

359
01:02:59,578 --> 01:03:08,787
But my experience shows that where there is no deeper cure there is a symptom going on which disappears.

360
01:03:09,028 --> 01:03:16,708
I will give you an example which is very common and you may have done it yourself.

361
01:03:17,224 --> 01:03:24,904
There was a time when they said salt is very bad for health.

362
01:03:25,178 --> 01:03:37,974
So a lot of Nat-m. cases who used to take a lot of salt because of their need of salt, they stopped eating salt.

363
01:03:38,704 --> 01:03:45,865
Their mind ordered their body not to want salt anymore.

364
01:03:46,104 --> 01:03:49,303
And you ask a case and they say I used to desire salt

365
01:03:49,544 --> 01:03:57,224
but as soon as I heard salt is bad for me I stopped eating and now I don’t desire anymore.

366
01:03:57,747 --> 01:04:04,147
That is not without consequences.

367
01:04:04,388 --> 01:04:19,258
That means that the salt which the organism needs to feed the nervous system is not enough and therefore,

368
01:04:19,507 --> 01:04:23,098
in order to cope with this lack of salt,

369
01:04:23,347 --> 01:04:31,027
which is needed but the organism does not take it because salt just goes out or is not given,

370
01:04:31,268 --> 01:04:41,018
then this nervous system will put another barrier on deeper level

371
01:04:41,272 --> 01:04:53,304
and the person becomes depressed to the extent that he does not need any more that salt.

372
01:04:53,584 --> 01:05:08,425
So desire for salt is transferred into depression in which case the person does not need any more salt so much.

373
01:05:08,609 --> 01:05:12,867
Really, when she says I don’t care about salt, they don’t care anymore about salt.

374
01:05:13,142 --> 01:05:21,337
In the meantime you see either irritability can be transferred or depression or anxiety,

375
01:05:21,486 --> 01:05:27,737
it depends on the organism to what it will be transferred.

376
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:41,668
I had several cases but 2 dramatic cases I will tell you.

377
01:05:41,943 --> 01:05:51,144
2 girls, the same story, they said as we were growing and developing breast...

378
01:05:51,418 --> 01:05:58,067
At the age of 12 and 13 when the girls first develop breast

379
01:05:58,308 --> 01:06:03,428
and the boys they start looking with sexual connotation

380
01:06:03,703 --> 01:06:09,828
and if the person sensitive perceives that and does not like.

381
01:06:10,103 --> 01:06:18,547
A little girl of 12, if they look at her and she feels that is bad I don’t like it

382
01:06:18,688 --> 01:06:23,054
and I have seen 2 cases in which they stopped growing.

383
01:06:25,865 --> 01:06:34,298
The breast did not develop anymore. In one case she lost her hair.

384
01:06:34,547 --> 01:06:47,863
She developed the androgenous hormones which stopped the female characteristics.

385
01:06:48,418 --> 01:06:54,307
She lost her breast and her hair. She became bold.

386
01:06:54,446 --> 01:07:04,547
She came to be treated when she was 32, she was wearing a wig and no breast.

387
01:07:04,786 --> 01:07:17,858
The mind has a very powerful hold of the organism. It can do things like that.

388
01:07:22,267 --> 01:07:31,427
But if there is no total cure we always have a transference.

389
01:07:31,666 --> 01:07:40,258
That fear which is bothering me is transferred to something else.

390
01:07:40,504 --> 01:07:44,244
In psychiatry they know it very well.

391
01:07:44,344 --> 01:07:52,824
They know the person loses one fear and eventually develops another.

392
01:07:53,024 --> 01:07:58,464
This has happened in a way in that case but that is not all.

393
01:07:58,736 --> 01:08:10,746
What has happened is that she took cortisone, anthroposophic medicines,

394
01:08:11,021 --> 01:08:29,707
she had what we call an aggression in her body by using the spiral which her organism rejected it,

395
01:08:29,807 --> 01:08:32,666
did not want it and started the bleeding.

396
01:08:33,428 --> 01:08:41,108
But it is interesting if you notice that by the time she started having the bleeding actually

397
01:08:41,391 --> 01:08:48,055
she was ameliorated in the headaches.

398
01:08:48,298 --> 01:08:54,945
So the organism is one and acts as one.

399
01:08:55,466 --> 01:09:04,185
You cannot separate one part and the other, the mental, the emotional or the physical.

400
01:09:06,465 --> 01:09:11,585
It always makes a balance.

401
01:09:14,425 --> 01:09:30,026
So due to these interventions and especially because of a tremendous fear,

402
01:09:30,295 --> 01:09:38,224
this fear which she mentioned according to my understanding it was limiting her life.

403
01:09:38,465 --> 01:09:46,145
Fear of being forsaken. It was a huge thing.

404
01:09:46,425 --> 01:09:55,285
That’s why she is very happy now to have get rid of this fear.

405
01:09:55,385 --> 01:10:03,065
She nods, she says yes you’re right. You cannot see that.

406
01:10:06,846 --> 01:10:14,384
In our analysis, first question, shall we take into consideration this fear?

407
01:10:14,625 --> 01:10:30,506
Yes or no? Why yes? Because she has said in my dreams I wake up crying. She does not cry now.

408
01:10:30,775 --> 01:10:38,455
In her dreams she is crying that means all that issue goes on in a subconscious level,

409
01:10:38,704 --> 01:10:44,065
she cries, she feels abandoned, there is no help.

410
01:10:44,345 --> 01:10:53,815
She has helped herself so far in the waking state by using her logical mind and a methodology

411
01:10:54,305 --> 01:11:09,945
which is Assagioli’s psychosynthesis and this is something which a lot of people say it helped them.

412
01:11:10,186 --> 01:11:13,505
I don’t dispute that.

413
01:11:13,710 --> 01:11:25,344
What I say is do we have perhaps a better system of medicine which can take away both;

414
01:11:25,588 --> 01:11:54,530
the headaches, the bleeding and the fear of being forsaken and can we give a remedy and cure her as she is now.

415
01:11:54,784 --> 01:12:05,025
What she is interested is stop her bleeding and her headaches and the bloatedness.

416
01:12:05,305 --> 01:12:09,386
That’s all I want. Don’t touch anything else.

417
01:12:09,655 --> 01:12:16,545
I don’t care if I cry in the evening. We cannot do that!

418
01:12:16,825 --> 01:12:23,466
Actually we can if we want to stop the bloatedness.

419
01:12:23,735 --> 01:12:27,575
What you are interested in more? The bloatedness is the worst!

420
01:12:27,824 --> 01:12:37,815
Ok, I’ll give you 3 remedies, you take one after another and in 3 days you won’t have it.

421
01:12:38,064 --> 01:12:41,045
How long will the cure last? I don’t know.

422
01:12:41,145 --> 01:12:46,692
What I know is that after 3 days she will say I don’t have the bloatedness anymore.

423
01:12:46,946 --> 01:12:54,372
If she asks me to cure the bleeding I can cure it and in the next period she won’t have it.

424
01:12:54,626 --> 01:13:06,657
The idea is can we cure her and at the same time not going through the aggravation

425
01:13:07,172 --> 01:13:21,506
which means not going through returning the fear of being forsaken and eventually returning of the skin eruption.

426
01:13:25,346 --> 01:13:31,747
And can we do this with one remedy?

427
01:13:31,986 --> 01:13:36,767
The answer to the first 2 questions is we cannot.

428
01:13:36,867 --> 01:13:46,147
If we do correct work she will have back the fear of being forsaken for a period of time

429
01:13:46,386 --> 01:13:51,924
and she eventually will have back the skin eruption.

430
01:13:52,024 --> 01:14:00,227
Can we do it with one remedy? The answer is no, we cannot do it with one remedy.

431
01:14:00,466 --> 01:14:05,586
The reason is because of this situation.

432
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:14,031
Can I see the repertorization?

433
01:14:14,383 --> 01:14:26,867
Let us say you put in your repertory all the symptoms that you need.

434
01:14:27,108 --> 01:14:38,628
Give me the symptoms. Feeling of being forsaken.

435
01:14:38,903 --> 01:14:44,787
You reduced them to 10? There were 30 symptoms!

436
01:14:44,887 --> 01:15:01,454
– There are still.
– Irritability before menses, mental amelioration during thunderstorm,

437
01:15:01,705 --> 01:15:06,307
weeping while dreaming and weeping in sleep in one rubric.

438
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:14,068
Heat of head during headache, pain on menses before,

439
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:24,945
pain right side, cataract, dryness in the morning.

440
01:15:25,217 --> 01:15:32,625
For instance here we may ask just as a matter of interrogation

441
01:15:32,897 --> 01:15:41,346
how much the disappearance of the fear has to do with the cataract.

442
01:15:41,585 --> 01:15:46,466
As a matter of inquiry.

443
01:15:48,764 --> 01:15:56,493
Clenching teeth, appetite increased before menses, thirst in the night,

444
01:15:56,744 --> 01:16:02,383
thirst for small quantities often, distention of abdomen after eating,

445
01:16:02,626 --> 01:16:09,544
rectum constriction during menses, rectum diarrhea before menses,

446
01:16:09,788 --> 01:16:21,064
menses clotted large clots, copious menses ,protracted, thin blood,

447
01:16:21,313 --> 01:16:32,866
cramp in uterus during menses, chest swelling of mammae before menses,

448
01:16:33,267 --> 01:16:40,424
dryness of fingernails, about fingernails...

449
01:17:17,065 --> 01:17:26,787
Farinaceous desire, draft of air aggravation, skin warts suppressed,

450
01:17:26,954 --> 01:17:40,867
skin eruptions eczema, lacerations of wounds, weakness during headache.

451
01:17:41,624 --> 01:17:48,304
Is any symptom that you would like to add in this repertorization?

452
01:17:50,345 --> 01:17:58,264
Almost everything we could find in the repertory.

453
01:18:01,378 --> 01:18:13,391
– She used the term ‘cataract’ and sometimes people mix up words and mean something else.

454
01:18:13,906 --> 01:18:21,347
– Have you been examined by an ophthalmologist? He is an ophthalmologist.

455
01:18:23,631 --> 01:18:36,431
You mentioned ‘cataract’. Was after an examination by an ophthalmologist?

456
01:18:45,847 --> 01:18:56,418
Yes. And did he tell you the degree? In the beginning?

457
01:18:57,187 --> 01:19:01,784
Because you are very young to have cataract.

458
01:19:02,031 --> 01:19:04,504
– I had that since I was a child.

459
01:19:05,027 --> 01:19:10,147
- The cataract?
– I think so.

460
01:19:18,707 --> 01:19:27,184
– Are you an ophthalmologist. Give us some information.

461
01:19:28,184 --> 01:19:32,547
– It’s possible to have a cataract from birth.

462
01:19:32,814 --> 01:19:37,424
– Wait a moment. This is different.

463
01:19:37,667 --> 01:19:46,427
Real cataract yes, she is having the beginning of it.

464
01:19:46,527 --> 01:19:56,147
– Probably she has things in her lens all her life already. It could be...

465
01:19:56,288 --> 01:20:07,667
- Is it possible that she can have cataract since childhood and at the age of 40

466
01:20:07,908 --> 01:20:11,507
and she will still have the same cataract? Is that possible?

467
01:20:11,748 --> 01:20:17,658
– Yes, it’s possible. But what you call nowadays a cataract is...

468
01:20:17,907 --> 01:20:32,866
- An opacity.
– It’s more an opacity nowadays. She has some opacities all her life.

469
01:20:33,105 --> 01:20:36,706
– Without developing?
– Without developing.

470
01:20:39,777 --> 01:20:48,737
– One of the characteristic of the cataract is that it is maturing, as far as I know.

471
01:20:49,506 --> 01:20:59,985
That’s why they say wait it’s not mature yet and it always becomes mature and you have the operation.

472
01:21:00,257 --> 01:21:07,665
In her case what she says is she has that cataract from the age...

473
01:21:07,742 --> 01:21:12,627
I don’t know... to the age of 40 and stays. It’s not a cataract.

474
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:15,703
We are talking about something totally different situation.

475
01:21:15,954 --> 01:21:22,767
If she was really examined and a cataract was found developing

476
01:21:22,867 --> 01:21:29,462
that means she had this development lately. The last 3-5 years.

477
01:21:31,151 --> 01:21:34,498
– Probably she had some opacities all her life.

478
01:21:34,744 --> 01:21:43,186
Might increase now but would still talk about a cataract.

479
01:21:43,458 --> 01:21:50,251
– Let’s not become ophthalmologist. Are you ophthalmologist?

480
01:21:50,351 --> 01:22:02,147
– No. She said when she was talking about her forsaken feeling that she was not seen.

481
01:22:02,386 --> 01:22:08,271
And there is a symptom in the repertory, mind delusion unseen.

482
01:22:08,547 --> 01:22:13,391
– No. This is a delusion. She doesn’t talk about this.

483
01:22:13,667 --> 01:22:23,384
She talks about her presence. Nobody takes notice of me, I’m here.

484
01:22:23,631 --> 01:22:30,031
She was feeling that nobody was taking notice of her presence. Not a delusion.

485
01:22:30,307 --> 01:22:35,427
– She said I have a sensation I was not seen.

486
01:22:35,666 --> 01:22:41,186
– It’s not a delusion. A delusion is different.

487
01:22:52,068 --> 01:23:05,508
– My cataract is slowly getting worse.
– Somebody told you from childhood.

488
01:23:05,747 --> 01:23:10,674
– I had these since childhood.
– These glasses?

489
01:23:10,774 --> 01:23:21,014
– Yes. But it’s getting worse. I will change the glasses more often nowadays.

490
01:23:21,784 --> 01:23:32,024
– Let’s not go to this detail because we are not specialists and I am afraid that it will confuse.

491
01:23:32,265 --> 01:23:37,285
We come to the point where we have to decide what is the remedy for this case.

492
01:23:37,385 --> 01:23:39,299
What should be the first remedy.

493
01:23:39,545 --> 01:23:58,992
Here, we have the possibility of Lyc. Sep. is coming as first remedy and Puls. is the second,

494
01:23:59,268 --> 01:24:11,299
Psor. is the third remedy and Lyc. Sil., Aur., Chin. and Verat. Is this a Sep. case?

495
01:24:13,587 --> 01:24:25,625
There is one symptom which she said which is characteristic of Sep. most probably and that symptoms was...

496
01:24:25,872 --> 01:24:58,148
Take out this thunderstorm symptom... Puls., Sep., Psor., Sil., Chin.

497
01:25:08,627 --> 01:25:14,265
Would you say she is crying easily?

498
01:25:15,027 --> 01:25:18,352
– You asked if she is crying easily.

499
01:25:18,628 --> 01:25:28,345
She’s not except with cold water in the bathtub or in the shower she cries easily!

500
01:25:36,187 --> 01:25:46,588
She actually likes hot bath.
– Every evening I have a hot bath.

501
01:25:46,727 --> 01:25:51,064
– Very hot?
– Yes, to relax.

502
01:25:51,311 --> 01:25:56,946
– And you enjoy?
– And I rather cry by myself.

503
01:25:59,786 --> 01:26:03,065
– You cry but not in front of others!

504
01:26:03,575 --> 01:26:21,744
– No, I prefer not to disturb others. I cry by myself.

505
01:26:22,775 --> 01:26:31,984
And I forgot to say when you were interviewing me that for few years I was very ill in my stomach,

506
01:26:32,249 --> 01:26:42,224
I couldn’t work, I had this constant diarrhea every day and I could hardly eat anything.

507
01:26:42,465 --> 01:26:47,765
– Chronic lumbar pain in association with this chronic diarrhea.

508
01:26:47,865 --> 01:26:54,265
That was about 1989 or 1990.

509
01:26:58,864 --> 01:27:03,625
– Would you say now that you have lack of self-confidence?

510
01:27:07,348 --> 01:27:14,295
- Yes, a little bit but it’s better. I still have it.

511
01:27:18,416 --> 01:27:33,261
– But at the same time I know no person who knows exactly how she wants to things to be.

512
01:27:34,027 --> 01:27:41,946
If I ask you, how would you like this you will say maybe so or so.

513
01:27:42,221 --> 01:27:47,856
Maybe she knows exactly, I want it this or that way.

514
01:27:48,107 --> 01:27:58,414
You can hardly find a person who knows so well and at the same time she says she has bad self-confidence.

515
01:28:01,744 --> 01:28:14,264
– Maybe in the house she feels confident and outside of the house she feels unconfident.

516
01:28:14,544 --> 01:28:33,987
– Yes.
– Actually, what you are saying is that in the house she’s quite dictatorial!

517
01:28:36,814 --> 01:28:45,925
– She is not dictatorial. But she is so pronounced.

518
01:28:46,025 --> 01:28:49,655
She knows this I want, that I don’t want.

519
01:28:52,215 --> 01:28:57,825
If you ask me what I want then I will say maybe this or that.

520
01:28:58,005 --> 01:29:04,746
She never! She knows exactly she wants this and doesn’t want that! It’s so clear.

521
01:29:05,015 --> 01:29:15,255
I haven’t met any person who knows so well from inside what she wants or not.

522
01:29:21,421 --> 01:29:32,906
– I am more sensitive before menses and I easily cry and I get easily emotionally hurt.

523
01:29:49,067 --> 01:30:16,186
– Aggravation cold bathing. Show me the remedies. Show me Sep.

524
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:39,507
Show me bloatedness in the abdomen, afternoon, after eating. Show me the remedies.

525
01:30:41,428 --> 01:31:07,428
Carb-v., Nux-v., Puls., Sep. It’s very difficult decision.

526
01:31:07,667 --> 01:31:16,900
What shall we do? After this analysis what would you prescribe?

527
01:31:17,206 --> 01:31:27,225
Can I see your impression? You are the homeopath, you are prescribing.

528
01:31:27,466 --> 01:31:59,466
Who prescribes Calc.? 2. Sep? 7. Puls.? Thuja? Med.? Verat.? Lyc.?

529
01:32:04,255 --> 01:32:11,216
The only remedy that was actually raised was Puls.

530
01:32:20,985 --> 01:32:30,940
The lady in the first row does not agree with Puls.! She said no.

531
01:32:31,086 --> 01:32:42,906
This is not a Puls. Puls. should cry and cry. But it is not always crying.

532
01:32:43,170 --> 01:32:48,026
As you remember I told about Puls. in India.

533
01:32:48,290 --> 01:32:57,250
A minister of textiles actually she was looking like her.

534
01:32:57,504 --> 01:33:08,160
For an Indian she was very tough. She came to me and I said Puls.

535
01:33:08,260 --> 01:33:16,450
So she went back to her homeopaths in India. Puls. for you? You never cry!

536
01:33:17,984 --> 01:33:25,410
I said yes, Puls. Her liver was not functioning.

537
01:33:25,564 --> 01:33:33,816
She was retaining water and when menses came she would become bloated and she had another dress,

538
01:33:34,348 --> 01:33:44,588
the whole body was retaining water for years after she was injected for rabies.

539
01:33:49,252 --> 01:34:01,985
Puls. took away everything. The only thing I could perceive for Puls. was a slight fear of dark.

540
01:34:02,252 --> 01:34:16,101
But from that time onwards I learned not all Puls. cry, not all Puls. are easily lead and persuaded.

541
01:34:16,347 --> 01:34:29,665
They have quite strong personalities especially when they feel they’re inside their area of expertise.

542
01:34:29,904 --> 01:34:43,491
My decision for her, the first remedy will be Puls. 10M.

543
01:34:45,387 --> 01:34:55,265
I respect your opinion but I have to make the decision.

544
01:34:56,027 --> 01:35:15,984
Puls. 10M, first remedy with a hope that she will come back with her forsaken feelings before are over.

545
01:35:24,451 --> 01:35:33,804
What are the main things on which we prescribe Puls.?

546
01:35:33,904 --> 01:35:41,626
Of course it is the forsaken feeling which we know in Puls. is so strong.

547
01:35:41,867 --> 01:35:45,607
About the bleedings and the headaches it’s ok

548
01:35:45,707 --> 01:35:51,666
but what is interesting is she sleeps like Puls. she stressed that.

549
01:35:51,766 --> 01:36:02,892
She said I sleep in that position which is the latest symptom she is having at the moment.

550
01:36:03,148 --> 01:36:10,828
I asked her about fat; she said no I don’t like and she cries.

551
01:36:10,992 --> 01:36:21,091
Instead of crying in daytime she cries in sleep and she feels forsaken in her sleep.

552
01:36:21,584 --> 01:36:27,491
So this is not a clear case of Puls.

553
01:36:27,984 --> 01:36:35,325
but Puls. it is perhaps the best possibility we have.

554
01:36:35,425 --> 01:36:39,226
– She is not a clear case, why 10M?

555
01:36:39,326 --> 01:36:45,105
– Because I feel that the problem in order to be touched

556
01:36:45,346 --> 01:36:49,627
since it is gone already in the subconscious level

557
01:36:49,891 --> 01:36:57,307
has to be a powerful potency to touch the deeper emotional problem

558
01:36:57,826 --> 01:37:05,016
which has been suppressed. That’s the first one I want to touch.

559
01:37:05,265 --> 01:37:16,026
– Am I supposed to take this once?
– Only once and pray to God.

560
01:37:16,685 --> 01:37:21,656
– And nothing between this year and next year I see you?

561
01:37:22,146 --> 01:37:34,946
– It will depend. What I expect is that the next remedy will be most probably Lyc., much clearer,

562
01:37:35,226 --> 01:37:38,786
and the third remedy must be Thuja.

563
01:37:39,066 --> 01:37:52,625
The last remedy will be Thuja and after Thuja we will have the reappearance of skin eruption.

564
01:37:55,447 --> 01:38:02,047
At any time you can drink coffee and stop the process!

565
01:38:02,147 --> 01:38:03,983
– I should not drink coffee.

566
01:38:04,126 --> 01:38:11,297
– You must not drink coffee. Absolutely forbidden!
