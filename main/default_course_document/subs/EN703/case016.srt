1
00:00:16,612 --> 00:00:23,348
This is the case of Daniel 32 years old.

2
00:00:39,507 --> 00:00:38,692
I had seen Daniel 4 years ago in private, not in video,

3
00:00:38,946 --> 00:00:51,985
he persuaded me and I prescribed for him Nat-m.

4
00:00:53,026 --> 00:01:08,132
50M and Daniel was complaining primarily for severe allergic reaction.

5
00:01:09,148 --> 00:01:30,226
– Urticaria, angioedema since 1993. 
– With Nat-m. 50M it appears

6
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:37,142
that Daniel was better for a period of 9 months

7
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:47,382
and after that it started coming back more and more and now he is quite bad.

8
00:01:47,897 --> 00:01:55,826
– I’m not sure about the period I was better but I think for that period it did some work.

9
00:01:57,622 --> 00:02:10,504
– He was better.
– Let’s see what happened afterwards, after giving you the remedy.

10
00:02:11,784 --> 00:02:13,826
Did you do something to counteract the treatment?

11
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:18,428
– I cannot remember. Nothing specific.

12
00:02:20,493 --> 00:02:26,108
– Do you remember if you kept on drinking coffee.

13
00:02:26,626 --> 00:02:28,943
– Probably I did. I am not a big coffee drinker

14
00:02:28,943 --> 00:02:32,508
but I have drunk coffee very infrequently for my work,

15
00:02:32,783 --> 00:02:37,628
I’m a lawyer I need that to keep me awake sometimes.

16
00:02:40,706 --> 00:02:45,064
– Now, how much coffee do you drink?
– I’ve actually eliminated coffee...

17
00:02:59,906 --> 00:03:05,545
I’ve got a slight swell in my right eye, my left hand you can’t see

18
00:03:06,064 --> 00:03:17,906
but it got welts and a slight one in my right arm there but when it gets bad it can get worse.

19
00:03:20,227 --> 00:03:24,306
– Show this picture.
– A picture only a mother could love!

20
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:29,426
And that’s quite a while back, it hasn’t been that bad for quite a long time.

21
00:03:29,698 --> 00:03:33,538
– It’s been worse where his whole face gets swollen.

22
00:03:47,618 --> 00:03:58,226
– If I should go back to the beginning, in 1993 I was about to go abroad,

23
00:03:58,498 --> 00:04:00,786
I had my wisdom teeth taken out, had a general anesthetic,

24
00:04:01,058 --> 00:04:05,667
I think antibiotics as well at the time and a week later I had my first attack,

25
00:04:05,906 --> 00:04:07,951
not quite as bad as that

26
00:04:08,227 --> 00:04:17,698
but similar and at the same time I pricked myself with a palm tree and my entire left hand swelled up.

27
00:04:19,747 --> 00:04:22,031
Another coincidence I was bitten by an insect,

28
00:04:22,307 --> 00:04:28,946
I just mention it because I week later I felt a fluid running out of my ear.

29
00:04:29,464 --> 00:04:34,938
That started then, I have been having these recurrent attacks sometimes it is bad.

30
00:04:38,263 --> 00:04:40,058
I’ve had this kind of attacks about 5-6 times during the years

31
00:04:40,307 --> 00:04:48,503
and other than I get a swollen eye, swollen lip, swollen soft tissue and pressure definitely makes it worse.

32
00:04:48,744 --> 00:04:54,903
The soles of my feet definitely get worse when I’m short of sleep and stressed.

33
00:04:56,183 --> 00:05:03,098
-I live a stressful life.
– You say stress is a factor.

34
00:05:03,347 --> 00:05:07,944
– I’m not sure. I think definitely lack of sleep is.

35
00:05:08,218 --> 00:05:13,975
It tends to trigger it and pressure, when I’m sitting on a chair.

36
00:05:20,624 --> 00:05:27,265
It tends to start and goes away within about a day or two.
– Food?

37
00:05:27,545 --> 00:05:30,615
– I have not been able to identify any food that triggers it.

38
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:35,984
Two foods I know I am allergic to sulphur dioxide in drinks,

39
00:05:36,225 --> 00:05:42,384
it’s preservative and these color fruit drinks.

40
00:05:44,185 --> 00:05:57,815
Wine is fine. It’s a food preservative. It’s a concentrated drink that has water juice.

41
00:05:58,064 --> 00:05:59,344
They often use sulphur dioxide.

42
00:05:59,585 --> 00:06:07,692
I start the wheeze, my chest closes up, I definitely have a response to honey,

43
00:06:08,462 --> 00:06:15,372
my throat gets very irritated, I start to clear the back of my throat.

44
00:06:15,867 --> 00:06:21,262
Other than that I don’t have any food allergies that I’m aware of.

45
00:06:21,772 --> 00:06:26,892
– We’ve tried many diets and he hates to diet.

46
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:37,388
I tried to cut out salicylic acids, wheat and sugar.

47
00:06:37,627 --> 00:06:39,692
– Have you ever taken aspirin?

48
00:06:39,948 --> 00:06:45,307
– Yes and actually I had a bad reaction. My throat...

49
00:06:45,582 --> 00:06:49,932
- Was it inside the throat?

50
00:06:49,956 --> 00:06:50,426
– I couldn’t speak actually, it was inside the mouth,

51
00:06:50,427 --> 00:06:56,332
it was the one time I was nervous that my breathing is trapped but it hasn’t ever happen again.

52
00:06:56,588 --> 00:07:01,186
– Has he ever taken cortisone before homeopathic treatment?

53
00:07:01,453 --> 00:07:05,788
– Yes, I took cortisone after the aspirin.

54
00:07:07,853 --> 00:07:12,973
But before my original allergic reaction in 1993, no.

55
00:07:14,253 --> 00:07:17,308
– I am in South Africa, he is in London.

56
00:07:18,093 --> 00:07:22,428
He weren’t going to a doctor, sometimes he will listen to me I treat him, it’s very bad,

57
00:07:22,703 --> 00:07:24,988
but this is how it works.

58
00:07:25,263 --> 00:07:29,346
– With homeopathic remedies? 
– Yes, on the e-mail.

59
00:07:30,108 --> 00:07:32,173
– So what remedies have you prescribed for him?

60
00:07:32,424 --> 00:07:34,733
– I’ll tell you what I’ve prescribed for him.

61
00:07:34,984 --> 00:07:40,348
Another doctor in South Africa when he comes home has prescribed for him.

62
00:07:40,623 --> 00:07:46,748
As a child when he got exertional asthma I used to give him Ars. which did well.

63
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:51,373
I used to give him low potency Nat-m. for hay fever.

64
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:56,744
He had quite a good response but it didn’t last very long.

65
00:07:56,988 --> 00:08:00,828
He used to get conjunctivitis quite a lot and I gave him Puls.

66
00:08:01,103 --> 00:08:07,503
and even now I tell him to take it makes him better.

67
00:08:07,746 --> 00:08:13,133
The doctor I saw in Pretoria said that Kali-i. would do him good

68
00:08:13,628 --> 00:08:23,106
because he was getting exhausted from work and he as a very high achiever he always succeeded very well

69
00:08:23,624 --> 00:08:28,226
and wanted to do in work very well and he has this inner conflict

70
00:08:28,744 --> 00:08:33,864
between doing the right thing in work and for his bosses,

71
00:08:34,108 --> 00:08:38,733
I don’t know if the father has an influence himself and wanting to be himself.

72
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:42,306
He is a very romantic person. He wants to study...

73
00:08:42,573 --> 00:08:47,693
- Archeology, astronomy, history, literature.

74
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:59,382
– There is much conflict inside  him.

75
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:05,507
– Keep going, you’ve summarized pretty well!

76
00:09:06,028 --> 00:09:10,627
– I can try and give you the case. As a baby he nearly died of salmonella.

77
00:09:12,428 --> 00:09:15,506
I was working, someone else was looking after him,

78
00:09:15,747 --> 00:09:20,377
he got giant urticaria when he was very young from a high dose of a fever mixture

79
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:24,217
and I think it might have had salicylic in it.

80
00:09:24,466 --> 00:09:28,547
He often had a post nasal drip and itchy nose, even now he gets it.

81
00:09:28,822 --> 00:09:37,017
He got in-growing toe nails often and had to have an operation for that.

82
00:09:41,868 --> 00:09:47,257
And then the main complaint, he completed his Master’s in Law in N.Y.,

83
00:09:47,506 --> 00:09:50,828
he came home, he had the prick on his hand,

84
00:09:51,862 --> 00:09:54,668
he had his wisdom teeth removed and he swelled very badly,

85
00:09:55,186 --> 00:10:03,628
it started in his scrotum and then it was spread to his legs and we took him to urologists

86
00:10:03,897 --> 00:10:06,947
and the doctor said he had septic fasciitis,

87
00:10:07,122 --> 00:10:13,134
put him into hospital IV drip and his hands swelled up with the drip.

88
00:10:13,385 --> 00:10:21,584
After he left to go overseas he told us that he kept with the swelling all over.

89
00:10:21,827 --> 00:10:28,624
The swellings are indurated, they are quite hard, it gets itchy,

90
00:10:28,901 --> 00:10:35,024
it develops like a raised plaque and sometimes you see it’s surrounded by red spots.

91
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:42,465
They affect everywhere, all sides, soles of his feet, hands, eyes, arms, leg, torso

92
00:10:42,704 --> 00:10:47,507
and there’s no pattern, I’ve tried to see if it starts left or right but...

93
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:52,854
- I mentioned that sometimes there is a left and a right symmetry.

94
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:59,924
Lot of it starts as a severe pressure, my watches here, my hands swells,

95
00:11:00,024 --> 00:11:07,880
sometimes it starts with the one eye and then it’s spread to the other eye but that’s less often.

96
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:13,615
– And I think a strong symptom; same time as he swells he develops different stool.

97
00:11:13,866 --> 00:11:17,455
– Quite often. I get an upset stomach.

98
00:11:18,735 --> 00:11:28,185
– Every time he has an allergic crisis then he has different stool.

99
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:42,026
That means softer?
– More fibrous, more flaky. Like bran flakes.

100
00:11:46,628 --> 00:11:49,945
– And he thinks that he’s better from exercise.

101
00:11:50,468 --> 00:11:55,340
– I think it produces adrenalin which sort of brings down the swelling

102
00:11:55,588 --> 00:12:01,304
but when I go and I exercise perhaps I take my mind off of this.

103
00:12:01,551 --> 00:12:06,947
– Better from exercise, mental, physical or both?

104
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:11,026
– I think a bit of both. Definitely mentally, I feel much better when I exercise.

105
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:14,767
In terms of the allergic reaction I sometimes feel it has a good effect.

106
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:17,014
I can sit here and wanting to scratch forever

107
00:12:17,114 --> 00:12:24,184
but when I go and exercise I feel the itching has subsided.

108
00:12:25,405 --> 00:12:27,856
– He always had a sensitive skin.

109
00:12:28,107 --> 00:12:34,241
If he scratches it, it goes red, if he squeezes a spot it gets inflamed.

110
00:12:38,561 --> 00:12:47,906
His back was prone to acne, not bad acne.
– He had a bad acne as young?

111
00:12:48,145 --> 00:12:53,026
– No. His back in prone to acne.

112
00:12:53,226 --> 00:12:58,908
– When I was a child rolling on grass I got hives.

113
00:12:59,172 --> 00:13:03,505
Grass produces a sort of allergic reaction.

114
00:13:05,308 --> 00:13:15,348
– For the gastrointestinal history he loves sweet things, pastries,

115
00:13:15,448 --> 00:13:26,817
sweet fruit juice, wants to drink juice with all his food, ice cream, cold drinks.

116
00:13:32,817 --> 00:13:37,208
And he’s a cold person.
–In what sense?

117
00:13:37,308 --> 00:13:42,328
– Not cold to people, you’re warm to people but physically cold.

118
00:13:42,428 --> 00:13:47,984
– You feel easily the cold?
– No, no I wouldn’t be so sure about that.

119
00:13:48,864 --> 00:13:52,210
I think I can survive in a t-shirt.

120
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,532
This is warm weather but in cold weather I don’t always feel the need to be well dressed.

121
00:13:55,788 --> 00:13:58,734
I enjoy the cold. I disagree with that.

122
00:13:59,085 --> 00:14:02,207
– Do you like to stay under the sun?

123
00:14:02,307 --> 00:14:06,027
– Yes but I don’t mind cold environment.

124
00:14:06,266 --> 00:14:13,946
I’m in England now and I can wear a t-shirt in cold weather. It’s not so bad.

125
00:14:16,781 --> 00:14:20,621
– Mother always sees he takes a jersey or a shirt.

126
00:14:20,864 --> 00:14:22,497
Now you took a shirt, you put it on,

127
00:14:22,597 --> 00:14:28,132
in your flat in the evening sitting by the window you put something warm.

128
00:14:28,286 --> 00:14:44,257
– I can handle the cold better.
– He dislikes fish. And he struggles to put on weight.

129
00:14:45,388 --> 00:14:51,937
– I can’t, even if I try. If I do a lot of gym and physical exercise,

130
00:14:52,188 --> 00:14:59,517
then I put on weight but other than that I can eat as much as I want I just don't put on weight.

131
00:14:59,617 --> 00:15:05,506
– And he hates to be frail, he wants to be strong and big.

132
00:15:05,745 --> 00:15:11,388
He hates when he’s like me!
– I feel better if I exercise.

133
00:15:13,425 --> 00:15:19,232
– What about salt?
– I don’t use a lot of salt in my food.

134
00:15:19,332 --> 00:15:26,497
– You dislike it if it is too salty.
– Yes.

135
00:15:28,546 --> 00:15:40,828
– Very strong sense of smell and his spine, he is very prone to stoop.

136
00:15:44,145 --> 00:15:51,586
Then his emotions and his personality; very full of tensions.

137
00:15:53,105 --> 00:15:57,117
If you talk about the child of love, he was my first child,

138
00:15:57,217 --> 00:15:59,012
the child of love and a lovely child!

139
00:15:59,266 --> 00:16:01,107
He was a very easy child, a good child at school.

140
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:07,779
Everybody loved him. He was just kind and warm, affectionate.

141
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:13,568
He cries easily now but he used to hold it in.

142
00:16:13,668 --> 00:16:18,019
Used to not to want to be weak, wanted to be strong.

143
00:16:18,165 --> 00:16:24,408
He gets pleasure from pleasing others and even impressing others

144
00:16:25,061 --> 00:16:29,411
but he wants to do what he believes in. That’s a conflict.

145
00:16:31,284 --> 00:16:39,141
– What he believes is correct or is fitting him more?

146
00:16:59,344 --> 00:17:03,607
– I wouldn’t do something to advance my career

147
00:17:03,707 --> 00:17:07,547
if I thought it was compromising my values and what is important,

148
00:17:07,811 --> 00:17:10,387
so I am not cutthroat in that sense.

149
00:17:10,628 --> 00:17:13,978
I’ve done things that I thought would be good for my career

150
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:18,824
and to impress people that I work will so I will do that,

151
00:17:19,024 --> 00:17:24,708
I do go that road to impress people

152
00:17:24,808 --> 00:17:33,743
but if I had to kill somebody or tell a lie or do something bad I wouldn’t do that.

153
00:17:33,884 --> 00:17:36,006
I wouldn’t be happy for my success.

154
00:17:36,106 --> 00:17:39,704
My sense of values of right and wrong are very strong.

155
00:17:39,984 --> 00:17:44,067
– He dislikes confrontation but he doesn’t avoid it.

156
00:17:44,334 --> 00:17:47,284
Even in university he would never be politically correct,

157
00:17:47,384 --> 00:17:52,784
he did things that made trouble for him because he believed in being open.

158
00:17:54,974 --> 00:18:01,744
But still it upsets him because he doesn’t like the confrontation that comes.

159
00:18:01,987 --> 00:18:08,144
– I don’t go looking for confrontation but sometimes I enjoy debate.

160
00:18:09,144 --> 00:18:17,614
When it comes I’m there. I get this from my father I guess.

161
00:18:17,865 --> 00:18:19,284
I’m not an aggressive person

162
00:18:19,384 --> 00:18:25,684
but when I get a sense of a threat or conflict I don’t mind facing it.

163
00:18:25,784 --> 00:18:30,314
– He won’t be walked over yet one has the feeling that he is a yielding person.

164
00:18:30,414 --> 00:18:36,344
He will fit to the girlfriend for example and the things that they like,

165
00:18:36,624 --> 00:18:42,744
he will go with them, he doesn’t like to upset me so he will try to do the Homeopathy if I say so

166
00:18:43,024 --> 00:18:46,584
but if he doesn’t want to do it he will go his own way.

167
00:18:46,864 --> 00:18:48,905
As I say there’s much conflict.

168
00:18:49,144 --> 00:19:00,144
He’s very rational, analytical and he finds it difficult to have a faith in spiritual things.

169
00:19:02,866 --> 00:19:05,783
– I tend to approach things rationally.

170
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:11,508
I can be inspired by beauty in the world and music and nature.

171
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:17,046
I’m not a religious person and I tend to be more rational.

172
00:19:17,146 --> 00:19:21,504
– I tried to make him meditate but it’s not easy.

173
00:19:21,648 --> 00:19:32,906
He can’t do it. And he has song sense of righttitude.

174
00:19:33,075 --> 00:19:36,505
– I also have an awareness life’s not fair sometimes

175
00:19:36,746 --> 00:19:39,206
and I don’t expect people to treat me fairly,

176
00:19:39,306 --> 00:19:43,971
if they take advantage it’s my fault I didn’t protect myself.

177
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:46,531
Here’s the way I approach it.

178
00:19:54,704 --> 00:19:59,231
– He doesn’t like to talk about his diet, his treatment and his problems.

179
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:07,012
He likes to talk about the world, archeology, astronomy, music, art and literature.

180
00:20:07,266 --> 00:20:10,588
And he hates to be humiliated.

181
00:20:15,185 --> 00:20:22,372
He thinks that recognition from others is more important than self-satisfaction.

182
00:20:22,626 --> 00:20:24,932
– Maybe yes.

183
00:20:27,746 --> 00:20:36,706
– But he does not forget criticism although he is very forgiving to those who love him.

184
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:39,777
He has a lack of inner peace.

185
00:20:40,028 --> 00:20:43,617
He’s always on the move, wants to go places, see countries.

186
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:46,671
– Do you feel you are in a hurry?

187
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:52,278
– I need to do things, yes. I never just sit back and do nothing for a long time.

188
00:20:52,378 --> 00:20:56,228
I need to be reading, I need to be learning, improving myself.

189
00:20:56,503 --> 00:21:01,007
– His house is in a mess, he needs to sort out his affairs but he doesn’t.

190
00:21:01,107 --> 00:21:09,303
He wants a girl and he likes company. Insatiable appetite for life.

191
00:21:10,067 --> 00:21:17,747
– You like company all the time or there are some times that you want to be alone as well?

192
00:21:17,988 --> 00:21:20,548
– I sometimes like to be alone as well

193
00:21:34,263 --> 00:21:40,147
but lately I spend less time on my own reading and thinking about things.

194
00:21:43,987 --> 00:21:52,267
Maybe leaving home, living abroad you tend to be more involved ina community.

195
00:21:53,704 --> 00:21:56,868
I’ve spent a lot of time developing myself as a person.

196
00:21:57,135 --> 00:22:01,465
I think I may have spent a lot of time reading, studying.

197
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,705
Now I think I like to meet people, spend more time being social.

198
00:22:04,944 --> 00:22:07,011
I have always been fairly social.

199
00:22:07,111 --> 00:22:15,707
– If you are in your flat and you’re upset about something

200
00:22:15,971 --> 00:22:21,905
and somebody comes and says you don’t look well, what is the problem,

201
00:22:22,377 --> 00:22:27,966
you like this kind of interference?

202
00:22:28,066 --> 00:22:36,772
– Not really. I’d rather say I’m fine, I’ll be ok, let’s talk about something else.

203
00:22:38,306 --> 00:22:43,894
– His friendships are not friendships, they’re just formal.

204
00:22:44,148 --> 00:22:49,266
He has just a few personal friends that he can confine.

205
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:53,384
– My closest relationships are the people I’m involved with,

206
00:22:53,628 --> 00:23:05,666
a girlfriend I don’t confide a lot of people. I confide my mother!

207
00:23:06,684 --> 00:23:13,513
– He has a conflict in work and with his girlfriend and I think the way he explains it.

208
00:23:13,613 --> 00:23:18,863
The conflict between his feelings and his mind.

209
00:23:22,703 --> 00:23:32,943
– Are you able to express your emotions, feelings of affection to your girlfriends?

210
00:23:33,086 --> 00:23:41,528
– Absolutely. Completely. What about your girl consoling you for something?

211
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:46,105
You like it?
– Yes, I do.

212
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,560
I think I am open in that sense.

213
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:54,308
If I have big conflicts, I have big career and personal decisions to make now

214
00:23:54,575 --> 00:23:58,666
it’s not like it has been around for the past 7 years that I’ve had my allergic condition,

215
00:23:58,905 --> 00:24:04,025
basically I’ve been involved in a relationship for a long time and we are on the stage

216
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:08,655
we have to decide if it’s going to go on and be together for the rest,

217
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:10,948
we get married or we are not going to.

218
00:24:11,215 --> 00:24:14,788
That’s the big issue to deal with and I am dealing with it right now.

219
00:24:15,055 --> 00:24:16,586
And it is my job.

220
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:21,845
I have to decide whether I am content with my current job or move elsewhere, move countries.

221
00:24:21,945 --> 00:24:25,625
So a lot of dilemmas I am dealing with. I am not a very decisive person.

222
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:30,135
I struggle to make choices.

223
00:24:30,384 --> 00:24:32,226
I have been thinking about these things for quite a while now.

224
00:24:32,506 --> 00:24:36,346
And sometimes I tend to take decisions when the circumstances force me to.

225
00:24:36,587 --> 00:24:40,945
When I do I do very well. At work I’m not very good at planning long term.

226
00:24:42,987 --> 00:24:46,827
If there is a crisis or something going on I deal with it very well

227
00:24:47,096 --> 00:24:52,706
but I am not very good at being proactive, I tend to wait for situations.

228
00:24:53,766 --> 00:24:59,627
– Rather than creating a situation for the future yourself.

229
00:24:59,727 --> 00:25:05,265
– But the conflict I see is between his emotions, because he loves the person,

230
00:25:05,506 --> 00:25:10,385
and his mind which says if this is an arranged marriage it will be wrong.

231
00:25:10,626 --> 00:25:14,746
And also in the work, between staying in the job and making a lot of money

232
00:25:14,987 --> 00:25:19,245
and becoming important and thinking oh! That’s not what I want.

233
00:25:19,345 --> 00:25:21,228
That’s not really what is meaningful to me.

234
00:25:21,467 --> 00:25:24,812
And the conflict is the same conflict he has always had.

235
00:25:25,068 --> 00:25:27,372
And he is being much worse lately.

236
00:25:27,628 --> 00:25:29,932
And when I come to London and he talks about it

237
00:25:30,188 --> 00:25:32,987
and he things he is sorting something out and he wakes up the next morning...

238
00:25:34,028 --> 00:25:40,428
The body is just full of red blotches, very bad.

239
00:25:40,667 --> 00:25:49,032
It’s worse because he talk.
– I tend not to confront such things.

240
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:52,507
It’s quite good to talk about it openly as we do,

241
00:25:52,782 --> 00:25:55,852
but on the other hand I tend to put them aside, I tend to ignore.

242
00:25:56,108 --> 00:25:59,288
My whole condition, I pretend it doesn’t have any effect on me.

243
00:25:59,388 --> 00:26:05,688
I haven’t been very aggressive about eating, doing elimination diets or anything like that.

244
00:26:05,788 --> 00:26:10,255
I just tend to say it will go away and I have been able to live with that until now.

245
00:26:10,506 --> 00:26:14,095
But I think I am reaching the stage now, it’s just enough!

246
00:26:15,108 --> 00:26:19,705
– And just a few generals I can add, it might help.

247
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:25,615
He dislikes animals messing on his clothes but he loves cats.

248
00:26:25,866 --> 00:26:28,131
– Dogs slobbering over me, I can’t stand it!

249
00:26:28,385 --> 00:26:30,181
– Dogs, no...
- I love cats.

250
00:26:30,281 --> 00:26:35,941
– Can a cat jump on you?
– Yes. Because cats are clean.

251
00:26:36,187 --> 00:26:40,027
Dogs are messy. He doesn’t like dogs. He used to be fastidious.

252
00:26:40,291 --> 00:26:44,901
He didn’t like to share glasses or eat from somebody, now he is changed.

253
00:26:45,147 --> 00:26:51,811
– That was long ago, not now, before I started dating people.

254
00:26:52,065 --> 00:26:58,111
– Like he is totally changed. He hurries when he is walking always, you’re far behind.

255
00:26:58,211 --> 00:27:02,945
He goes ahead always. He hates to be weak, like I told you,

256
00:27:03,189 --> 00:27:05,251
therefore he denies his illness.

257
00:27:05,505 --> 00:27:08,581
He works hard to build his muscles and change his small frame,

258
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:15,984
he has a tendency to be skeptical and suspicious and to doubt people and their motives.

259
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:21,791
He is careful with money but he is learned to be generous with gifts.

260
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:24,385
He like to be careful with his money.

261
00:27:25,424 --> 00:27:28,646
He loves to talk about things that interest him.

262
00:27:28,746 --> 00:27:32,343
He bites or picks his nails all the time, he picks his lips,

263
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:35,144
picks his toenails all the time.

264
00:27:35,418 --> 00:27:54,867
All his life. And he grinds his teeth.

265
00:27:55,108 --> 00:27:58,458
– When I sleep.

266
00:27:58,948 --> 00:28:01,783
– And Dr. Luke said he must always think of delusions.

267
00:28:02,024 --> 00:28:06,038
He has this feeling of dissolution sometimes that it’s all meaningless.

268
00:28:06,138 --> 00:28:10,019
He has worked so hard, he’s put so much into the relationship...

269
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:13,900
- I am very optimistic about life and everything, I really am,

270
00:28:14,148 --> 00:28:20,025
but it’s slight cynicism, you know you don’t think that just by being applied

271
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,095
or practical or focused in a particular area,

272
00:28:22,285 --> 00:28:24,825
everything I going to work out for you.

273
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:30,468
In a way I see it as a transient thing, maybe that I will find the path.

274
00:28:30,735 --> 00:28:34,308
Either in terms of relationships or work and I will get it on and it will be fine.

275
00:28:36,106 --> 00:28:38,425
The purpose of putting an effort to get something,

276
00:28:38,672 --> 00:28:42,412
there is a slight cynicism about the world in general.

277
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:46,216
– Looks like you are a little bit futile.

278
00:28:46,316 --> 00:28:50,617
– Yes. Hard energy and hard effort which I have put for a lot of things in my life,

279
00:28:50,866 --> 00:28:54,457
may not necessarily be the answer.

280
00:28:55,986 --> 00:28:59,308
– As a child they said he was like 60 years old.

281
00:28:59,577 --> 00:29:04,182
He was so mature. But as a person now he is full of child-like things.

282
00:29:04,428 --> 00:29:13,785
He can play games, he likes to laugh, he loves to go and play games even with children.

283
00:29:14,575 --> 00:29:18,666
– I joke with people.

284
00:29:19,946 --> 00:29:27,187
– He desires air, I think you are definitely a cold person.

285
00:29:31,792 --> 00:29:37,945
And the treatment, now I can tell you the last few treatments I have given him and how he responded.

286
00:29:39,448 --> 00:29:45,625
Like I said he had Ars. as a child, Nat-m., Puls., Euphr.

287
00:29:46,148 --> 00:29:48,708
– Tell me the treatment after I gave him...

288
00:29:50,392 --> 00:29:57,907
- I went back to Kali-i. because it helped him before.

289
00:29:58,179 --> 00:30:02,265
And I told him, because I was away and doesn’t like it when I ask him the questions,

290
00:30:02,512 --> 00:30:05,072
I just gave him a formula, I know that’s bad,

291
00:30:05,348 --> 00:30:10,707
but I said take Kali-i. 200C, take Tub. 200C

292
00:30:10,807 --> 00:30:14,454
– So, you have given Kali-i. and Tub. repeatedly.

293
00:30:14,708 --> 00:30:21,565
- Alternating. I think he got Tub. 3 times, 200C, 200C and 1M.

294
00:30:21,665 --> 00:30:23,984
And then I thought he was getting much worse.

295
00:30:24,025 --> 00:30:26,106
So I just stopped giving him anything,

296
00:30:26,381 --> 00:30:31,801
but after the Tub. I spoke with him one day and he had his asthma

297
00:30:33,024 --> 00:30:35,983
and he got the conjunctivitis, like he used to have.

298
00:30:36,226 --> 00:30:41,103
So I thought that’s fine, I am very happy. Just leave it.

299
00:30:41,346 --> 00:30:45,448
But then the swellings started to get much worse.

300
00:30:45,517 --> 00:30:56,057
And the one day, because he was starting to feel weepy I told him to take Puls. 1M.

301
00:30:56,306 --> 00:31:00,908
And he took it and then I am never sure if he was getting worse from an aggravation

302
00:31:01,177 --> 00:31:04,227
and would get better or the meds have just passed over him.

303
00:31:04,502 --> 00:31:12,228
So I left him after that.
– So Kali-i., Tub. and Puls.

304
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:15,545
You have given these 3 remedies after Nat-m.

305
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:17,759
– And I think a little bit of Sulph.

306
00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:26,315
but low, 12X he had for 2 weeks, every day and Sulph. 200C.

307
00:31:26,415 --> 00:31:29,586
I think Sulph. has helped him but I wasn’t sure.

308
00:31:30,127 --> 00:31:36,502
– Your feet in bed are warm or normal?

309
00:31:36,748 --> 00:31:40,226
Do you have to stick them out of covers, do you have to wear socks?

310
00:31:46,212 --> 00:31:50,306
– They are normal.
– When you sleep you cover them?

311
00:31:50,545 --> 00:31:56,088
– Yes. Last night I noticed they’re a bit cold so I put a sheet on me.

312
00:31:56,188 --> 00:31:57,803
But generally I am not that sensitive.

313
00:31:57,903 --> 00:32:00,428
– Do you have any salivation during sleep?

314
00:32:00,697 --> 00:32:06,307
– Not often, very seldom. Just when I wake up but nothing major.

315
00:32:06,582 --> 00:32:08,706
– He has a healthy libido.
– What?

316
00:32:08,973 --> 00:32:18,704
– Healthy sex life.
– Healthy or too much?

317
00:32:18,947 --> 00:32:24,387
– I think it’s healthy. It’s active and it’s healthy.

318
00:32:24,454 --> 00:32:26,824
It’s not obsessive, it’s not too little.

319
00:32:26,968 --> 00:32:29,623
Right now I am trying to focus on everything else.

320
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:32,947
Because I’ve got another things in my life to worry.

321
00:32:34,227 --> 00:32:39,863
– Do you take fruits?
– Yes, quite a lot.

322
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:56,146
Bananas I love, I like peaches, apples, mango I love.

323
00:33:00,751 --> 00:33:06,658
Lots of apple juice.
– What about fruits which our sour?

324
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:12,786
– No. Lemons, grapefruits I don’t like.

325
00:33:14,831 --> 00:33:21,746
– Do you have nightly emissions, an orgasm during sleep?

326
00:33:21,918 --> 00:33:31,225
– No. One thing I do have when I urinate,

327
00:33:31,477 --> 00:33:38,272
there is a slightly release after I urinate.

328
00:33:41,365 --> 00:33:45,295
– Drops of urine after urination.

329
00:33:45,546 --> 00:33:51,695
– Yes, in the last 4 months I think.

330
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:03,747
– How much water do you need?

331
00:34:04,286 --> 00:34:09,106
– I don’t drink an enormous amount of water.

332
00:34:09,378 --> 00:34:12,431
- You drink cold drinks instead?
– Yes, a lot.

333
00:34:12,607 --> 00:34:18,066
During the day I don’t drink a lot, I need to remind myself sometimes to drink.

334
00:34:18,831 --> 00:34:21,667
– What kind of cold drinks you drink?

335
00:34:22,178 --> 00:34:25,746
– A lot of apple juice, sparkling water

336
00:34:26,787 --> 00:34:31,631
and just recently I have stopped a lot of fruit juices.

337
00:34:31,907 --> 00:34:33,598
– I told him to stop drinking them.

338
00:34:33,698 --> 00:34:39,185
– If I had my way I would drink a lot of fruit juices, diluted with water.

339
00:34:39,457 --> 00:34:41,627
I don’t drink a lot of Coke or things like that.

340
00:34:41,891 --> 00:34:47,781
They are bad. I used to like Sprite and Fanta.

341
00:34:48,027 --> 00:34:50,851
– Have you ever used cannabis indica?

342
00:34:51,105 --> 00:34:53,565
– Twice in my life when I was much younger.

343
00:34:53,665 --> 00:34:55,971
– Was any dramatic effect?

344
00:34:56,225 --> 00:35:01,184
– Not that dramatic, very pleasant but not initially.

345
00:35:01,456 --> 00:35:06,304
It was not as dramatic as maybe I thought it should be.

346
00:35:06,576 --> 00:35:12,976
And that was on 2 occasions, when I was 23 years old. I haven’t since.

347
00:35:13,227 --> 00:35:20,656
It definitely had a very pleasant effect but maybe I expected more.

348
00:35:28,587 --> 00:35:34,736
My mother mentioned my sense of smell is very acute.

349
00:35:34,987 --> 00:35:40,621
Music has a very good mood enhancing effect on me.

350
00:35:40,864 --> 00:35:45,304
I listen to a nice piece of music and I will love it. I love dancing.

351
00:35:45,427 --> 00:35:55,928
– What kind of dancing? Latin American dancing, salsa, merengue.

352
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:59,780
– What about rhythmic and strong music?

353
00:36:00,026 --> 00:36:05,664
– I like it, yes. I enjoy it. Heavy African rhythms.

354
00:36:06,944 --> 00:36:10,784
I enjoy it but I am not into head banging music,

355
00:36:10,828 --> 00:36:14,181
not heavy metal and that sort of things.

356
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:18,885
I like more melodic, more harmonious.

357
00:36:22,425 --> 00:36:28,907
– And when he was a child I gave him Kali-c. once and he got ulcers on his palate.

358
00:36:30,863 --> 00:36:34,504
– You like the fat of the meat or you take it out?

359
00:36:34,748 --> 00:36:36,028
– I take it off.

360
00:36:36,303 --> 00:36:39,524
– No way you eat it?
– I wouldn’t just eat plain fat.

361
00:36:39,624 --> 00:36:43,663
If there is a bit of fat in the meat I would have it but I don’t like fat.

362
00:36:44,173 --> 00:36:52,104
– Eggs? You like them normally or a lot?

363
00:36:52,648 --> 00:36:57,065
– I like eggs. I don’t take a lot of them because of my problem.

364
00:36:57,334 --> 00:37:00,048
I tend to have cereal in the morning when I am going to work,

365
00:37:00,148 --> 00:37:03,065
but I like eggs, I like to put tomato sauce to them.

366
00:37:03,312 --> 00:37:06,805
I like spices and seasoning.

367
00:37:06,905 --> 00:37:11,405
– He doesn’t like to eat eggs without them.

368
00:37:13,465 --> 00:37:22,192
– But what type of eggs you like?
– Fried eggs I like the most.

369
00:37:23,748 --> 00:37:28,868
– Would you like to have every day 2 fried eggs?

370
00:37:29,379 --> 00:37:32,708
– No, that would be too much. I like to alternate, to have cereal.

371
00:37:32,947 --> 00:37:46,019
It’s bad for the cholesterol.
– If it was good to have an egg every day...

372
00:37:47,045 --> 00:37:49,496
- Probably I wouldn’t have eggs the whole time.

373
00:37:49,745 --> 00:37:57,425
It’s funny because sometimes I think eggs also irritate my mouth lining slightly if I have too much eggs.

374
00:37:58,946 --> 00:38:02,445
I’ve never been sure about it but sometimes I get that sense.

375
00:38:02,545 --> 00:38:06,748
– Do you have any problem tying your clothes here?

376
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:16,924
– With my shirts yes.
– Can you put a tie? If you are just intolerable.

377
00:38:19,748 --> 00:38:27,703
– No, I prefer not to wear a tie, but I have to for work. So I am used to it.

378
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:41,267
– He is focused now but if he talks about himself these days he just drifts off.

379
00:38:43,584 --> 00:38:46,787
– While we are talking now I am being quite focused

380
00:38:47,054 --> 00:38:50,104
because I am trying to give you all the information I can to get better

381
00:38:50,384 --> 00:39:01,334
but I have been drifting a little. I really have.

382
00:39:01,424 --> 00:39:08,547
– Because you don’t find the conversation interesting enough or engaging enough?

383
00:39:08,814 --> 00:39:10,584
– Partly.

384
00:39:10,864 --> 00:39:16,227
– When he is thinking he wants to explain his thoughts he starts to talk and then he just...

385
00:39:16,494 --> 00:39:19,724
What was I saying? Like too much is happening.

386
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:21,281
– He doesn’t remember what he is saying?

387
00:39:21,381 --> 00:39:26,587
– He just loses his focus and he doesn’t want to focus in his life and make a choice.

388
00:39:27,736 --> 00:39:31,906
– How is your memory?
– Pretty good.

389
00:39:32,173 --> 00:39:38,573
– Do you forget sometimes what you are saying or what you have to do?

390
00:39:39,068 --> 00:39:44,188
– No. I don’t have bad memory like going senile.

391
00:39:44,463 --> 00:39:54,185
I tend to remember things. Lately maybe it hasn’t been that good as it was.

392
00:39:54,424 --> 00:39:59,054
I am feeling a lack of direction lately to a certain extent in my life.

393
00:39:59,305 --> 00:40:01,514
It’s true. Direction career-wise.

394
00:40:01,614 --> 00:40:03,574
Personal-wise, the country I am going to live in.

395
00:40:03,828 --> 00:40:06,134
I think everything has been drifting.

396
00:40:06,629 --> 00:40:09,189
I haven’t been as focused as I could be.

397
00:40:09,464 --> 00:40:11,824
– What about South Africa? You are not thinking of going back?

398
00:40:11,965 --> 00:40:17,424
– I don’t think so.
– When I fix the country he will come back.

399
00:40:17,667 --> 00:40:23,824
– When you become a prime minister you can come back!

400
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:41,225
– After I gave him Nat-m. 50M, did you repeat it?

401
00:40:41,464 --> 00:40:49,144
– No, it was just once.
– I was scared.

402
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:58,384
– He has been vaccinated of course?
– Yes.

403
00:40:58,627 --> 00:41:03,747
– And also when he was a child they did routine tuberculous test on the children

404
00:41:04,014 --> 00:41:10,804
to see if they needed BCG and he was positive.

405
00:41:10,904 --> 00:41:14,658
They said he needed BCG but I didn’t let them give it to him.

406
00:41:14,804 --> 00:41:18,585
Then I was so angry because he had had the tuberculous test.

407
00:41:18,826 --> 00:41:29,584
I thought it shouldn’t be necessary.
– Are you afraid of the dark?

408
00:41:29,825 --> 00:41:33,945
Can you sleep in the dark without problem?
– Yes.

409
00:41:34,186 --> 00:41:42,905
I think water sometimes might be uncomfortable, I scuba-dived, I didn’t feel entirely comfortable.

410
00:41:43,146 --> 00:41:46,021
– As a child he was more scared to go to the deep waters.

411
00:41:46,267 --> 00:41:48,065
– I think I had a bad experience once.

412
00:41:48,304 --> 00:41:56,507
I was pushed into a swimming pool by a kid. I didn’t like that.

413
00:41:58,544 --> 00:42:03,941
– That’s a keynote; he doesn’t like to be criticized. He doesn’t like to fail.

414
00:42:04,187 --> 00:42:13,665
– I don’t like failure. I don’t like to take the risk of failure I suppose.

415
00:42:13,765 --> 00:42:18,981
I take risks but I calculate them.

416
00:42:20,061 --> 00:42:24,505
– That’s another contradiction, he wants to travel and adventure but he wants to stay.

417
00:42:25,264 --> 00:42:28,345
– You never ate fish in your life?

418
00:42:28,586 --> 00:42:33,706
– I’ve eaten fish, I just don’t like it as much as meat. I love red meat.

419
00:42:33,975 --> 00:42:36,784
– But not fat in the meat?

420
00:42:37,546 --> 00:42:44,464
– Pure fat, absolutely not, meat with a bit of fat in it I can live with it.

421
00:42:44,985 --> 00:42:51,895
Slightly fatty meat tastes fine to me and maybe sometimes a bit of fat can taste good

422
00:42:52,144 --> 00:42:57,505
but if it recognizably fat, pure fat, absolutely not.

423
00:42:59,065 --> 00:43:05,706
When I used to eat pork, I used to eat the crackling,

424
00:43:05,975 --> 00:43:09,305
the fat on the edge of bacon, I like that.

425
00:43:09,515 --> 00:43:14,267
It tasted quite nice but otherwise not.

426
00:43:14,896 --> 00:43:20,864
Because burned sometimes it doesn’t even taste like fat.

427
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:38,784
– You say in-growing toe nails but I see you don’t have a problem,

428
00:43:39,028 --> 00:43:42,768
do you cut them especially?
– No, I had them operated.

429
00:43:42,868 --> 00:43:51,225
Sometimes they get a bit irritated but I still have slightly in-growing toe nails.

430
00:43:51,466 --> 00:43:57,766
One thing to mention; I burp quite a bit, I don’t know where it comes from but I do.

431
00:43:57,866 --> 00:44:04,535
– I think definitely when he is nervous.

432
00:44:07,465 --> 00:44:11,084
– He always had a gland here.

433
00:44:11,184 --> 00:44:15,508
– Not lately though.
– Little discreet gland.

434
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:18,068
– Does he have problem with his teeth?

435
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:20,900
– Not very good teeth but I gave him fluoride as a child

436
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,586
but his teeth are the worst of my children.

437
00:44:26,908 --> 00:44:30,125
– Perspiration during sleep?

438
00:44:30,225 --> 00:44:34,428
– Sometimes when I am stressed or anxious I notice I do perspire

439
00:44:34,703 --> 00:44:39,548
but otherwise no. If I sleep and I wake up I’m fine, if it’s hot I perspire.

440
00:44:39,823 --> 00:44:45,186
But definitely I have noticed when I am very anxious about something I perspire.

441
00:44:46,223 --> 00:44:49,026
– Ok. Let’s go!

442
00:44:50,824 --> 00:45:00,903
The first that we notice is that we struggle to have a clear case.

443
00:45:08,144 --> 00:45:22,206
Why is it not clear? Maybe the interference of several remedies after Nat-m.

444
00:45:22,306 --> 00:45:31,297
which has brought about a period of amelioration has interfered

445
00:45:31,548 --> 00:45:35,388
in order to give this sense of confusion.

446
00:45:35,652 --> 00:45:53,308
The question is whether still Nat-m. is indicated or whether another remedy makes an appearance.

447
00:45:53,572 --> 00:46:01,506
I was not really able to point down either the one or the other.

448
00:46:01,745 --> 00:46:08,668
I was not able to see whether a clear case of Nat-m. is still there

449
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:14,052
or whether another remedy is better than Nat-m.

450
00:46:14,306 --> 00:46:21,632
In the process as we were looking there were a few other possibilities

451
00:46:21,732 --> 00:46:26,337
but none of them was clear.

452
00:46:26,588 --> 00:46:35,267
So given the facts that Nat-m. was the one remedy that actually kept him

453
00:46:35,534 --> 00:46:40,387
for a period of time on a better situation,

454
00:46:40,654 --> 00:46:46,264
given also the fact that he never stopped drinking coffee

455
00:46:46,544 --> 00:46:49,348
because as he said he’s careless about his diet

456
00:46:49,866 --> 00:46:57,295
and he did not most probably pay attention to the idea of not drinking coffee at all.

457
00:46:59,664 --> 00:47:05,825
You take homeopathic remedy, especially Nat-m. is sensitive to coffee

458
00:47:06,564 --> 00:47:12,610
and it’s one of the main remedies that has this type of reaction.

459
00:47:12,864 --> 00:47:16,450
You will see this allergic reaction.

460
00:47:16,948 --> 00:47:28,640
So taking one coffee in 9 months maybe has no effect but taking coffee regularly,

461
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:38,615
once or twice a week definitely will have an antidotal effect eventually.

462
00:47:38,864 --> 00:47:53,185
Do not get the idea that if I drink only one or two coffees a week that will not antidote the remedy.

463
00:47:53,185 --> 00:48:02,573
Therefore on the one hand we have the fact that Nat-m. had given an amelioration for a period of time,

464
00:48:02,824 --> 00:48:08,463
in spite of the fact he kept on taking coffee,

465
00:48:08,706 --> 00:48:18,703
given also the fact that we do not see at this moment another remedy appearing,

466
00:48:18,846 --> 00:48:32,508
given the fact that he put 33 symptoms... Can you just show?

467
00:48:42,614 --> 00:48:49,509
Still Nat-m. is the first remedy. What are the symptoms?

468
00:48:50,025 --> 00:49:03,589
He’s taken all kinds of symptoms. Desire for company, consolation....

469
00:49:04,064 --> 00:49:16,905
Sensitive to odors... Eye swelling... Flaky stool.

470
00:49:17,669 --> 00:49:28,184
Show me, this is a peculiar symptom. Verat. is quite strong there.

471
00:49:28,425 --> 00:49:41,225
But I could not confirm it. Phos. also is a possibility and therefore

472
00:49:41,494 --> 00:49:47,384
because Nat-m. and Phos. were a possibility,

473
00:49:47,525 --> 00:49:49,669
for a moment I was thinking,

474
00:49:49,844 --> 00:49:50,906
when I was talking about fried eggs

475
00:49:51,147 --> 00:50:07,446
and all that of Nat-p. Nat-p. is a more open person than Nat-m.

476
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:15,985
More communicative, social and somebody who does not like to speak about himself

477
00:50:16,226 --> 00:50:17,927
but he cares about others.

478
00:50:18,027 --> 00:50:24,986
He is interested in conversations. I was not able to confirm.

479
00:50:25,086 --> 00:50:33,100
There are 2 keynotes; one is night emissions in their sleep.

480
00:50:33,415 --> 00:50:42,575
A typical Nat-p. in men usually has orgasm during sleep.

481
00:50:42,826 --> 00:50:49,226
Of course he has a normal sexual life and does not have the extra energy

482
00:50:49,465 --> 00:50:50,506
but it doesn’t matter.

483
00:50:50,745 --> 00:50:59,705
Still it happens in spite of the fact the person may have normal sex life during the day.

484
00:51:00,228 --> 00:51:14,107
Desire for eggs. And therefore my suggestion will be stop the coffee entirely,

485
00:51:14,382 --> 00:51:21,792
stop also the mint from the toothpaste.

486
00:51:24,108 --> 00:51:34,705
Eliminate and use toothpaste with another flavor like strawberry or something

487
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:45,976
because I found out that Nat-m. can be antidote by mint.

488
00:51:46,225 --> 00:51:49,206
Therefore he has to stop coffee and mint.

489
00:51:49,306 --> 00:51:52,462
That’s all he can do anything else he likes.

490
00:51:52,705 --> 00:52:02,688
And go back to 50M and take 3 doses.

491
00:52:04,987 --> 00:52:17,292
You have to give him 3 doses, one every day of Nat-m. 50M and have in mind Nat-p.

492
00:52:18,572 --> 00:52:25,656
If we have a kind of reaction then we wait,

493
00:52:25,905 --> 00:52:31,546
even after the first remedy if he has a reaction, you stop.

494
00:52:31,792 --> 00:52:34,382
Second dose, he has a reaction, you stop.

495
00:52:34,625 --> 00:52:42,305
Third time 50M then wait in any case.

496
00:52:42,572 --> 00:52:47,182
– There are a few symptoms missing from Nat-p. one was the night emissions and...

497
00:52:47,425 --> 00:52:56,385
- The desire for fried eggs. Real desire. They can have 10 eggs a day.

498
00:52:57,147 --> 00:53:06,892
There was but not strong enough for me to go straight to that.

499
00:53:07,148 --> 00:53:30,747
I investigated that and he said not every day. Any questions? No, thank you.

500
00:53:33,454 --> 00:53:38,786
Yesterday, I wanted to ask about the Nat-m. case.

501
00:53:40,066 --> 00:53:45,976
You originally said that if you give a remedy that is close

502
00:53:46,225 --> 00:53:48,167
but it’s not the right remedy it will have an effect

503
00:53:48,267 --> 00:53:49,946
but after a time the effect will go.

504
00:53:50,187 --> 00:53:56,587
Maybe isn’t this the case with the Nat-m. where the man had an effect for a while

505
00:53:56,856 --> 00:53:59,665
and then the effect went away.

506
00:53:59,906 --> 00:54:01,414
– Which case of Nat-m. are you talking?

507
00:54:01,514 --> 00:54:06,465
– Yesterday it was the last case of Ruth’s son. Daniel.

508
00:54:06,732 --> 00:54:14,668
Angioedema. Is it not possible? Is it not an idea?

509
00:54:14,907 --> 00:54:18,508
– I don’t understand your question, repeat your question.

510
00:54:18,747 --> 00:54:25,147
– They question is it possible that Nat-m. was very close to the right remedy

511
00:54:25,422 --> 00:54:30,028
but was the wrong remedy and thus had an effect for a while and the effect went away?

512
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:42,305
– Yes, it’s possible though if it is close in this way he would report

513
00:54:42,572 --> 00:54:49,985
rather an amelioration on the emotional level only, not really on his condition.

514
00:54:50,252 --> 00:54:56,552
Usually if it is close and especially Nat-m. will report an amelioration in this condition.

515
00:54:56,652 --> 00:55:01,144
The second is his mother told for 9 months he did not complain.

516
00:55:01,391 --> 00:55:03,704
After that he started complaining.

517
00:55:03,804 --> 00:55:08,106
He cannot remember very well for how long.

518
00:55:08,206 --> 00:55:19,587
But what made me think of Nat-m. again was the fact that he never stopped drinking coffee.

519
00:55:19,826 --> 00:55:26,744
And we know that if somebody keeps on drinking coffee it will be sometime

520
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:33,144
when he will definitely antidote his treatment, especially Nat-m.

521
00:55:33,391 --> 00:55:39,544
So the first thing we have to do is to repeat and see whether Nat-m. will still work.

522
00:55:39,791 --> 00:55:44,419
When I saw him it was much closer than he appeared here.

523
00:55:44,665 --> 00:55:54,828
But still I feel that Nat-m. will do again the job

524
00:55:55,067 --> 00:56:04,027
and most probably better than the first time if he stops drinking coffee.

525
00:56:05,068 --> 00:56:09,147
- One of the students said your shoe laces are open.

526
00:56:09,422 --> 00:56:12,887
– Don’t worry! My shoe laces are always open!

527
00:56:12,987 --> 00:56:16,464
I’ve never fallen! Let them be!

528
00:56:16,741 --> 00:56:23,141
– Is it possible to treat a relative, Daniel was treated by his mother?

529
00:56:23,387 --> 00:56:26,704
– Difficult! It’s very difficult!

530
00:56:26,981 --> 00:56:33,704
For instance, I have been treating my wife for 30 years unsuccessfully!

531
00:56:40,045 --> 00:56:44,027
I don’t know what happened. You cannot see. You’re blind.

532
00:56:44,202 --> 00:56:54,744
Most probably the woman has this ability blinding us so we cannot see the truth!

533
00:56:55,267 --> 00:56:58,066
– Is there a wife syndrome too?

534
00:56:58,338 --> 00:57:16,387
– There is no such syndrome and you know why. I like the way that you stop and ponder!
