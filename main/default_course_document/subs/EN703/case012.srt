1
00:00:16,653 --> 00:00:21,303
Can you tell us what the problem is?

2
00:00:21,544 --> 00:00:25,918
– I read in your book you could heal lupus.

3
00:00:26,704 --> 00:00:31,544
– I never wrote in my book I can heal lupus but...

4
00:00:32,067 --> 00:00:37,454
- Ok, I wondered if you could help me.
– That’s different.

5
00:00:37,744 --> 00:00:43,387
– You have good success rate.
– In some cases.

6
00:00:43,854 --> 00:01:08,174
– I‘ve had serious illness in 1995. I had cancer of the bowel and needed a resection.

7
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:22,505
– Without having an opening.
– And I was left incontinent.

8
00:01:24,547 --> 00:01:36,028
– Of stool and urine.
– Both. Before the operation they said I have fortnight to live.

9
00:01:36,292 --> 00:01:42,428
– Can you tell us how old you are.
– 52.

10
00:01:42,546 --> 00:01:46,424
– And you were told before the operation...

11
00:01:46,665 --> 00:01:51,964
- I would need this bag, radiotherapy, chemotherapy.
– You did?

12
00:01:52,064 --> 00:01:54,831
– And I had a fortnight to live if I didn’t have the operation.

13
00:01:55,107 --> 00:02:05,586
So I went forward to the operation. Then later, in 1998 I had a triple bypass.

14
00:02:06,104 --> 00:02:12,258
And the surgeon there said you have 3 months to live if you don’t have that done.

15
00:02:14,031 --> 00:02:17,106
And he said you were born with heart disease.

16
00:02:17,278 --> 00:02:20,706
That threw me a bit because I’ve seen many doctors in my life.

17
00:02:20,945 --> 00:02:23,865
Obviously as you do and not one of them picked up on that.

18
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:33,615
Though I was breathless and had lots of problems that could have related to the heart.

19
00:02:38,986 --> 00:02:44,768
– When was the bypass?
– In 1998.

20
00:02:44,868 --> 00:02:50,745
– That means 3 years after the operation.
– Yes, that’s right.

21
00:02:51,035 --> 00:02:57,699
– Now the heart started after the operation or was it already there?

22
00:03:00,465 --> 00:02:59,585
- It was very weak before that because...

23
00:02:59,852 --> 00:03:05,742
- You had your heart checked before and it was found to have a problem?

24
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:13,152
– It was the heart surgeon who told me I was born with a heart disease and no one else had picked up on this.

25
00:03:13,424 --> 00:03:19,067
I think it’s quite lazy and it’s struggling along into 50 till all this goes.

26
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:25,985
It was a miracle I’ve lived this long without ever realizing I had a heart disease.

27
00:03:26,224 --> 00:03:34,427
That’s what I think. And in 1986 they gave me a diagnosis of lupus.

28
00:03:37,992 --> 00:03:43,065
10 years back somebody said you have lupus.

29
00:03:43,312 --> 00:03:49,345
– Was there a biopsy done?
– It was a test done into a homeopathic hospital.

30
00:03:49,584 --> 00:03:53,185
– Tests.
– Blood tests, yes.

31
00:03:53,429 --> 00:04:02,661
And breathing tests done in the Royal London homeopathic hospital.

32
00:04:04,187 --> 00:04:06,994
And they said you have lupus.

33
00:04:07,265 --> 00:04:13,294
– Where was the lupus?
– In the face.

34
00:04:13,394 --> 00:04:21,245
– So somebody saw that typical eruption and then they made a blood test?

35
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:39,105
Do you know the blood test?
– There is a recent test.

36
00:04:39,356 --> 00:04:52,987
– SLE. Hashimoto thyroiditis, CA of the rectum, bladder instability,

37
00:04:53,262 --> 00:05:00,172
ischemical disease with coronary artery bypass impossible and chronic fatigue.

38
00:05:00,428 --> 00:05:07,105
Myalgic encephalomyelitis. Current treatment; thyroxin.

39
00:05:08,385 --> 00:05:20,149
Atenol, Zocor, aspirin, co proxamol and includes hypromellose eye drops.

40
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:42,456
So we have a rather complicated case here.

41
00:05:42,705 --> 00:05:47,072
You have been taking all these drugs?

42
00:05:47,344 --> 00:05:50,945
– I take less of them now. I don’t take Zocor anymore.

43
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:57,861
I don’t take the painkillers anymore. I take the thyroxin and Atenol.

44
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:07,096
– What is the Atenol for?
– β- blocker.

45
00:06:07,345 --> 00:06:10,836
– And you take aspirin?
– Yes.

46
00:06:10,936 --> 00:06:15,746
– How many aspirins?
– One every day in the morning.

47
00:06:15,997 --> 00:06:18,337
– And what is the problem with your eyes?

48
00:06:18,852 --> 00:06:24,465
– They are very dry because of lupus, Sjogren syndrome.

49
00:06:24,988 --> 00:06:27,448
Like sand is thrown to the face.

50
00:06:27,548 --> 00:06:30,264
– Are you married?
– I was. Divorced.

51
00:06:30,544 --> 00:06:36,944
– Do you have children?
– Yes, 2. One 25 and one 29. A boy and a girl.

52
00:06:37,187 --> 00:06:44,344
– Were you married once?
– Once, 23 years.

53
00:06:44,624 --> 00:06:50,744
– And then you divorced.
– Yes.

54
00:06:51,904 --> 00:06:58,727
– Is the boy the oldest?
– Yes, 29.

55
00:06:58,827 --> 00:07:04,461
– So you were married quite early.
– 21.

56
00:07:04,704 --> 00:07:08,026
– Did you have affairs before?
– No.

57
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:12,666
– You were affected before with venereal disease?

58
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:20,346
– The only think I can think of is when I was abused by my stepfather.

59
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:30,346
– At the age of?
– 5 to 12.

60
00:07:30,864 --> 00:07:33,845
My real father left when I was 18 months,

61
00:07:33,945 --> 00:07:39,724
I never saw him after that day till the day he died.

62
00:07:39,824 --> 00:07:42,501
And this other man arrived when I was about 3.

63
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:46,587
– When did you start having affairs? At what age?

64
00:07:46,851 --> 00:07:49,344
– I did not have affairs.

65
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:58,668
– That means you married without having an affair before.

66
00:08:06,864 --> 00:08:12,771
– No. I was abused from about the age of 5 till about the age of 12.

67
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:14,862
And I thought how do I stop this.

68
00:08:15,105 --> 00:08:20,771
So I prayed and next time he came I said that if you touch me I would tell the man next door

69
00:08:21,025 --> 00:08:23,331
because he was quite a friend with the man next door.

70
00:08:23,585 --> 00:08:27,425
And he kind of respected that man and he said you wouldn’t dare and I said try me

71
00:08:27,425 --> 00:08:33,754
so he didn’t try and I had that kind of protection until I left home at 16.

72
00:08:35,621 --> 00:08:42,021
And my mother was ill with multiple sclerosis.

73
00:08:43,312 --> 00:08:57,016
And when I discovered my father’s death certificate, he had heart disease and bladder cancer...

74
00:09:02,412 --> 00:09:07,611
There is a quite chronic heredity.

75
00:09:07,765 --> 00:09:11,986
So when I went to a homeopath in Britain they said oh, you are too difficult to deal with.

76
00:09:12,227 --> 00:09:18,146
So I wanted, if you are a clever man, to help me.

77
00:09:25,092 --> 00:09:42,386
I did see an homeopath last October and she gave me Syph. 1M, I think.

78
00:09:44,028 --> 00:09:52,546
– Up to 1M or just 1M?
– 1M repeated 3 times.

79
00:09:52,785 --> 00:09:57,666
– And this was in...?
– October last year.

80
00:09:58,501 --> 00:10:02,341
She got a bit hesitant about taking on my case

81
00:10:02,587 --> 00:10:08,225
because she said I might have to go through cancer and heart disease again to sort of get better.

82
00:10:08,464 --> 00:10:12,108
She was afraid of theses flair ups.

83
00:10:12,347 --> 00:10:15,971
– And you have heart problems at the moment.
– Yes, I do.

84
00:10:17,749 --> 00:10:26,365
– What was the effect of this remedy? Was any effect? Did you feel anything?

85
00:10:26,465 --> 00:10:33,847
– Not dramatically, but I feel kind of calmer.

86
00:10:33,947 --> 00:10:39,387
I was really nervous and agitated. I feel a bit calmer.

87
00:10:39,651 --> 00:10:43,127
– Since October you repeated the remedy?
– No, just once.

88
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:45,788
– Did you take another remedy?

89
00:10:46,052 --> 00:10:54,225
– No. On the plane I did. Some travel remedy that helps with fear of flying.

90
00:10:54,397 --> 00:11:03,737
– So you have fear of flying.
– Yes. Claustrophobic. I don’t like lifts.

91
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,705
– Do you have any other fears?

92
00:11:06,977 --> 00:11:12,348
– I am alone but I don’t like being alone very much.

93
00:11:12,512 --> 00:11:17,217
– You fear to be alone?
– I did but I got used to it.

94
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:24,132
– Fear of being alone only in the night or even in the day?

95
00:11:27,672 --> 00:11:36,417
– Night time I think. And fear of death I had.

96
00:11:36,568 --> 00:11:45,105
Because I have been through so much like nearly died of cancer, nearly died of heart disease.

97
00:11:45,277 --> 00:11:50,268
Somehow I am here so it can’t be that bad. Someone up there is looking out for me.

98
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:54,285
So I feel more connected with the source now.

99
00:11:54,385 --> 00:12:00,785
– After your divorce did you have a relationship?
– No.

100
00:12:01,057 --> 00:12:03,345
– You stayed alone.
– Yes.

101
00:12:03,617 --> 00:12:06,428
– And your children are not in the house.

102
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,297
– I am on my own in a flat.

103
00:12:10,546 --> 00:12:18,226
When I first left home I lived with some hippies but then I found a flat.

104
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:21,246
– The hippies did not rape you...

105
00:12:21,346 --> 00:12:28,625
- No, they were good, I felt very safe. I was in Wales.

106
00:12:32,988 --> 00:12:37,585
They respected. They realized I had a lot of problems. They were kind.

107
00:12:40,932 --> 00:12:46,035
I mean there were drugs going on but I didn’t want to get into it. It was a choice.

108
00:12:46,306 --> 00:13:00,309
– You refused.
– No, it was just... I didn’t feel ready.

109
00:13:00,427 --> 00:13:09,861
I felt very sort of abandoned and lost and depressed after the divorce in 1990

110
00:13:10,107 --> 00:13:13,985
I went to these hippies and I needed to get with a group.

111
00:13:16,302 --> 00:13:23,212
I was just full of depression after all that.
– I am confused now.

112
00:13:23,468 --> 00:13:33,541
– You said you left home at the age of 16 and then you joined some hippies.

113
00:13:33,651 --> 00:13:38,867
– No, 1990 I joined the hippies, after my marriage.

114
00:13:39,108 --> 00:13:44,504
I was feeling depressed and someone said come and join us for holidays

115
00:13:44,784 --> 00:13:49,624
and I went and the hippies were there and it was ok.

116
00:13:51,184 --> 00:13:58,584
– You were already grown up.

117
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:07,038
How did you live after leaving home at the age of 16? Did you go to work?

118
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:11,284
– I worked a little bit to get some money and then a friend said come

119
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:17,545
and share a flat with us and I shared with 3 other girls in London.

120
00:14:17,784 --> 00:14:29,065
– While you were working?
– Yes. It was very difficult, I did 2 jobs to sort of keep going.

121
00:14:29,586 --> 00:14:33,187
And when I was about 17 I had a nervous breakdown.

122
00:14:34,191 --> 00:14:38,818
– Because of too much stress?

123
00:14:39,064 --> 00:14:47,967
– Yes. And I got married at 21 to a chap who was older than me.

124
00:14:49,827 --> 00:14:56,654
– Much older?
– Yes 23 years older.

125
00:14:56,905 --> 00:15:05,104
And like you say you marry for security and stuff you said yesterday... That’s true.

126
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:18,184
– But is it true that you never had a real love experience before?

127
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:24,767
– Not really. What happened to me put me off...

128
00:15:24,867 --> 00:15:33,827
- Yes, because of the experience. The problems with the eyes is it myopia?

129
00:15:34,094 --> 00:15:39,465
– Astigmatism and...
– Shortsightedness.

130
00:15:48,425 --> 00:16:01,744
– Do you know if any of your ancestors were suffering with TB?
– A great uncle had TB.

131
00:16:01,987 --> 00:16:08,654
– Did he die of it?
– No. He had an operation.

132
00:16:12,227 --> 00:16:15,054
A lot of them had rheumatism,

133
00:16:15,805 --> 00:16:25,178
one great aunt had cancer and my mother we don’t know much about her family her mum and dad

134
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:31,330
she was brought up by aunties because she was ill I was brought up by her great auntie,

135
00:16:31,584 --> 00:16:34,660
so she brought both of us up.

136
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:44,705
My mother’s auntie brought me up as well as my mother.

137
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:58,341
– Did you have a period in your life in which you were happy?

138
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:10,181
– Beginning of the marriage when I had the 2 children. About 8 years.

139
00:17:10,945 --> 00:17:16,385
– After that you found out that that something was going on which you didn’t like?

140
00:17:16,629 --> 00:17:23,187
– I had very bad periods, endometriosis.

141
00:17:24,281 --> 00:17:35,509
Which resulted in hysterectomy in 1998.

142
00:17:40,172 --> 00:17:56,209
– My husband had a vasectomy in 1976 and he lost his interest so we started fall apart.

143
00:17:56,309 --> 00:18:09,279
– You had normal sexual interest or was it too much and you suppressed it?

144
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:15,180
– It could have been. It was not as good as it could have been.

145
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:21,907
You talk about that Eros, I’ve never experienced it.

146
00:18:22,225 --> 00:18:27,299
– So you answer like an English woman.

147
00:18:29,957 --> 00:18:34,468
What I want to know actually is a more straight answer;

148
00:18:34,712 --> 00:18:41,668
did you have sexual desire that was suppressed because of your husband situation?

149
00:18:42,425 --> 00:18:54,719
– My situation was suppressed because of the situation in my childhood, the abuse, that made it worse.

150
00:18:54,986 --> 00:19:01,625
– That’s one. But you got in marriage and you functioned.
– I tried.

151
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,695
– Did you function in the marriage?

152
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:09,305
That means if you had sexual intercourse...
- No proper orgasm.

153
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:21,251
– That means you were excited during the foreplay but no final orgasm.
– I never had.

154
00:19:21,505 --> 00:19:26,525
– Never?
– No. I wanted but no.

155
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:31,301
– That means you had some desire. There was an excitement.

156
00:19:31,447 --> 00:19:38,205
– Physically it was painful, it was too difficult. The endometriosis made it painful.

157
00:19:38,305 --> 00:19:43,461
– But the endometriosis came after your marriage.

158
00:19:43,707 --> 00:19:46,414
– I always had painful periods.

159
00:19:46,514 --> 00:19:49,387
I got to doctors but they didn’t do nothing about it.

160
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:54,166
And then a friend of ours who was a gynecologist and he said come and see me privately,

161
00:19:54,266 --> 00:19:58,204
so I went to see him, he said you have endometriosis 22 years.

162
00:19:58,304 --> 00:20:02,508
I will take your uterus away. It’s too painful for you.

163
00:20:02,747 --> 00:20:07,356
And I was about 40 then when he told me that.

164
00:20:07,628 --> 00:20:10,981
– But with endometriosis you had 2 children.

165
00:20:11,227 --> 00:20:22,747
– I know. It was a miracle! It was very painful.

166
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:26,587
– How did he know it was 22 years that you had that?

167
00:20:28,385 --> 00:20:33,571
– He told after he took the uterus out. He did the examinations.

168
00:20:33,825 --> 00:20:38,945
– By looking at the condition of the uterus.
– It was very painful.

169
00:20:39,184 --> 00:20:46,051
– You started having painful periods. Premenstrually or during?

170
00:20:46,305 --> 00:20:50,111
– Very premenstrual tension.

171
00:20:53,067 --> 00:21:00,744
Migraines, I wanted to kill someone, I was really angry, threw things.

172
00:21:01,263 --> 00:21:04,932
– You were angry because you were a woman because this happened to you?

173
00:21:05,186 --> 00:21:09,537
– Sometimes because I was a woman, sometimes because I wanted to feel pain-free.

174
00:21:09,823 --> 00:21:12,145
I wanted to enjoy.

175
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:26,748
But since the hysterectomy the migraines have gone, that pain has gone and it’s good.

176
00:21:30,852 --> 00:21:39,506
– I wrote the remedy here and he pressed the button of the computer and showed the same remedy.

177
00:21:43,462 --> 00:21:50,777
But we can continue for the sake of the class understanding the case.

178
00:21:53,527 --> 00:21:59,222
You look very calm, very composed.

179
00:21:59,686 --> 00:22:11,812
– I’m working at it! You have a calming influence!
– Thank you.

180
00:22:12,066 --> 00:22:17,226
– I can sell myself as Calmol!

181
00:22:31,545 --> 00:22:34,745
Your sleep was good?
– Yes.

182
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:38,064
– Did you have nightmares?
– I had in the past.

183
00:22:38,585 --> 00:22:42,566
– Bad nightmares?
– Very bad. Screaming.

184
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:49,066
– Were you waking up with screaming?
– Yes.

185
00:22:50,615 --> 00:22:55,466
– And then your husband would come and calm you.
– Yes.

186
00:22:55,735 --> 00:22:58,026
– And it took you some time to calm down?

187
00:22:58,295 --> 00:23:04,185
– There was dreams of knives, persecution running.

188
00:23:06,745 --> 00:23:12,865
– Somebody was chasing you with a knife to kill.

189
00:23:13,145 --> 00:23:20,445
Did you have dreams of you killing somebody? Hitting or killing.

190
00:23:20,545 --> 00:23:25,945
– Yes, I wanted to kill the stepfather very much.

191
00:23:26,186 --> 00:23:31,575
– Did you kill him?
–No, I should have.

192
00:23:31,865 --> 00:23:34,466
– He is dead now so I’m relaxed.

193
00:23:34,984 --> 00:23:38,852
– But still inside you you have not forgiven.

194
00:23:39,106 --> 00:23:42,946
– I have tried to forgive but it’s not easy.

195
00:23:45,252 --> 00:24:01,388
– It’s unbelievable. I don’t want to torture you more.

196
00:24:01,557 --> 00:24:08,347
You are a good case. We’ll go to the class and analyze your case.

197
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:27,257
This as you can see is a very complicated case with very deep pathology.

198
00:24:30,582 --> 00:24:41,337
It comes because of a predisposition as she explained

199
00:24:41,827 --> 00:24:51,826
plus this genetic predisposition was brought out because of severe stress.

200
00:24:52,067 --> 00:24:55,666
The way that she described the stress,\

201
00:24:55,907 --> 00:25:07,186
everybody can understand how much this child has suffered and what terror she has been through.

202
00:25:07,427 --> 00:25:09,147
How do we know the terror?

203
00:25:09,734 --> 00:25:14,978
Because of the nightmares that were in the subconscious,

204
00:25:15,224 --> 00:25:28,024
this kind of nightmares indicate the depth of the terror that she was going through.

205
00:25:34,947 --> 00:25:44,146
This had a terrific effect upon the physical body and brought out all the pathology.

206
00:25:45,426 --> 00:25:53,871
This is a typical case where it shows what we claim;

207
00:25:54,147 --> 00:26:06,178
that the pathology is only the end-result of a process in the organism going into a imbalanced state.

208
00:26:06,424 --> 00:26:10,511
So imbalance can go from one pathology to another

209
00:26:10,787 --> 00:26:18,706
and if it is too much and the organism resists in one system

210
00:26:18,978 --> 00:26:39,951
and the pathology spreads to the other system whether it is digestive, urinary, genetic, mental or emotional.

211
00:26:40,738 --> 00:26:51,471
What is interesting for her case is that this woman with all this suffering

212
00:26:51,747 --> 00:26:58,947
could have been really mentally affected a lot which is a miracle

213
00:26:59,214 --> 00:27:06,571
that she is in such a good state with only the fears.

214
00:27:15,544 --> 00:27:22,367
For those who know Homeopathy, the remedy is clear.

215
00:27:22,467 --> 00:27:33,071
Everybody knows the remedy. You have a problem with the remedy.

216
00:27:37,944 --> 00:27:48,184
I expected I would come to the class and everybody would know the remedy.

217
00:27:48,436 --> 00:27:56,111
If you were in the school process I would make you write the remedy in a piece of paper,

218
00:27:56,387 --> 00:28:03,544
give it to me, then afterwards I’d put the marks.

219
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:14,031
It’s a typical case and this is interesting.

220
00:28:15,587 --> 00:28:27,131
Such case is not possible be effected homeopathically unless she starts with the right remedy.

221
00:28:29,726 --> 00:28:42,281
And the remedy is clear. Maybe it’s clear for me.

222
00:28:42,447 --> 00:28:47,667
But I believe you will also see it.

223
00:28:47,908 --> 00:28:58,704
Here we have a case in which fright is one of the main problems.

224
00:28:58,947 --> 00:29:07,664
She got terror, fright. Ailments from fright you can take it into your repertorization.

225
00:29:11,024 --> 00:29:15,854
Without this causative factor the remedy was coming.

226
00:29:16,105 --> 00:29:20,184
When I wrote the remedy he looked and he pushed the button,

227
00:29:20,461 --> 00:29:28,664
the computer was giving the same answer without ailments from fright.

228
00:29:36,344 --> 00:29:52,556
This is a case where fright as a main causative factor has started the process of pathology

229
00:29:52,656 --> 00:29:57,143
 which this woman presents.

230
00:29:57,144 --> 00:30:07,138
And the remedy can be found only if we take into consideration the mental,

231
00:30:07,384 --> 00:30:13,266
emotional sphere and not the pathology.

232
00:30:13,538 --> 00:30:19,938
If you take SLE, cancer of the colon,

233
00:30:20,184 --> 00:30:27,618
heart problems you will never come down with the right prescription.

234
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:38,866
Here we really have to deal on the first causative issue

235
00:30:39,138 --> 00:30:48,867
because she gives us enough information on that level to be sure that this is the remedy

236
00:30:49,106 --> 00:30:52,707
otherwise if you take the details of the heart,

237
00:30:53,218 --> 00:30:56,271
you give a heart remedy, forget it.

238
00:30:56,547 --> 00:31:03,704
If you take the details of the colon, you give a colon remedy, forget it.

239
00:31:03,951 --> 00:31:09,071
If you get the details of SLE give Sep...

240
00:31:12,664 --> 00:31:26,498
Sep. is a possibility yes or no? She has received Sep.?

241
00:31:26,644 --> 00:31:31,864
You had Sep. Long time ago. I did not know.

242
00:31:32,111 --> 00:31:36,466
She forgot to tell me I said you were having Sep.

243
00:31:36,738 --> 00:31:43,631
Why I suggested so? I am not a psychic!

244
00:31:43,631 --> 00:31:49,266
Because I know how the mind of homeopaths functions.

245
00:31:49,538 --> 00:31:54,894
If she went to the homeopathic hospital and said about the orgasm they would give Sep.

246
00:31:55,384 --> 00:32:01,027
So I said you had Sep. and she said yes.

247
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:15,274
Because of this typical saddle eruption combined with aversion sex.

248
00:32:15,374 --> 00:32:24,344
She didn’t say aversion sex. That is different. She was terrified to have sex.

249
00:32:25,871 --> 00:32:36,111
You saw me when I inquired, because I gave all the information, did you have some excitements,

250
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:39,186
yes she had excitement, she could not reach.

251
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:43,298
Why she could not reach? She could not trust.

252
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:50,978
The idea is this organism can no more trust to such an extent

253
00:32:51,224 --> 00:32:57,378
as to have herself given up to the other person

254
00:32:57,624 --> 00:33:04,585
as in a state of sexual intercourse when you really reach the climax,

255
00:33:04,824 --> 00:33:08,944
your orgasm leads you, as I said the other day,

256
00:33:09,438 --> 00:33:13,294
God has given us this tool so you cannot resist,

257
00:33:13,545 --> 00:33:20,698
you have to give up your ego but she was conditioned so much because of fear

258
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:26,864
 she could not give up her ego, her protection.

259
00:33:27,107 --> 00:33:35,306
But was what inside of her? What was the main feeling?

260
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:49,900
Anger. Terror. She said several times I want to kill sometimes.

261
00:33:50,148 --> 00:33:54,745
I wanted to kill him. Anger.

262
00:33:55,020 --> 00:34:02,425
And then we see the subconscious fear and terror which comes through.

263
00:34:06,265 --> 00:34:13,188
We will be lead eventually to the remedy.

264
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:21,625
Also it is interesting to understand this remedy.

265
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:27,535
She says I do not like flying.

266
00:34:27,786 --> 00:34:34,700
It’s not aversion or fear of flying it’s fear of been enclosed,

267
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:42,380
being in a cage where you have no escape.

268
00:34:43,908 --> 00:34:48,780
But all her life since childhood she was trying to find a way to escape

269
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:52,106
and she has found out that she cannot escape.

270
00:34:52,345 --> 00:34:57,988
She has to have this type of...

271
00:35:03,708 --> 00:35:10,532
I don’t know what word to use for such things happening.

272
00:35:14,387 --> 00:35:27,952
Fear of narrow places it’s not a fear of narrow places it’s an understanding construction of the soul.

273
00:35:28,228 --> 00:35:33,348
How it was constructed through that terror.

274
00:35:33,587 --> 00:35:38,468
I have to escape, to leave, anger.

275
00:35:38,979 --> 00:35:43,827
When menses were coming, anger,

276
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:55,347
she said this reminded her of being a woman that they could have done these things to her.

277
00:36:03,797 --> 00:36:08,419
Just leave it as it was originally.

278
00:36:08,665 --> 00:36:19,705
Let me show you the symptoms that he was putting as he was hearing the case.

279
00:36:29,406 --> 00:36:35,388
Give the symptoms. After being abused,

280
00:36:35,555 --> 00:36:41,988
after being abused sexually, fear of being alone, fear of being alone in the night,

281
00:36:42,255 --> 00:36:49,988
fear of death, fear of narrow places, sadness, sighing, myopia, cancer lupus,

282
00:36:50,255 --> 00:36:59,466
involuntary stool, urination involuntary, chest heart complaints, thyroid,

283
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:08,175
endometriosis, suppressed desire, coition painful, general menses.

284
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:16,345
Even this kind of repertorization which is irrelevant to what I am saying

285
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:30,387
and to the way I understand her case brought out the correct remedy.

286
00:37:32,965 --> 00:37:42,179
Don’t show them! Is this a case of Caust.?

287
00:37:42,325 --> 00:37:46,750
Because she is losing urine, she has fear of narrow places.

288
00:37:46,904 --> 00:38:09,742
Is this a case of Tub.? Hyos.? Bell.? Stram.? Cocc.? Staph? Show them.

289
00:38:13,068 --> 00:38:25,891
Flat repertorization. What is the first remedy?

290
00:38:26,145 --> 00:38:42,785
Arg-n., Lyc., Sulph., Lach., Psor., Ars., Calc., Sep., Bell., Kali-c., Nat-m.

291
00:38:43,024 --> 00:38:50,981
Go further, Puls. Is this a case of Puls.? No?

292
00:38:51,227 --> 00:39:14,067
You will have a surprise? Graph.? Nit-ac.? Sil.? Ant-c.? Am-c.? Carb-v.? Nat-c.? Nux-v.?

293
00:39:14,167 --> 00:39:25,787
She wants to kill. Caust.? Hyos.? Ign.? Phos.? Spong.? Staph.? Glon.?

294
00:39:27,585 --> 00:39:31,425
Never mind, show me the VES.

295
00:39:42,427 --> 00:39:46,867
Why you changed it? It was Stram. first.

296
00:40:02,107 --> 00:40:06,986
Why didn’t you put nightmares?

297
00:40:07,225 --> 00:40:20,825
Even second with this kind of repertorization you can immediately see that this is a Stram. case.

298
00:40:26,192 --> 00:40:42,067
Put the causative factor. Ailments from fright. 3 times.

299
00:40:49,219 --> 00:40:54,220
I want to ask one question. Which question will I ask now.

300
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:58,208
I did not ask it inside I wouldn’t make it very clear.

301
00:41:02,498 --> 00:41:04,547
Are you afraid of the dark?
– Yes.

302
00:41:04,786 --> 00:41:08,111
– Very much
- Very much.

303
00:41:10,424 --> 00:41:15,787
I did not ask this question because I didn’t want to make it very clear for you.

304
00:41:16,026 --> 00:41:18,861
I wanted to challenge you a little bit.

305
00:41:19,866 --> 00:41:32,985
Before putting fear of the dark show me Stram. ailments from fright show me the effect.

306
00:41:33,265 --> 00:41:35,752
– I already put fear of the dark!

307
00:41:35,906 --> 00:41:48,588
– Oh, you put. Take it out. Fear of being alone in the night, if you put it 3 times, that’s it.

308
00:41:49,622 --> 00:41:53,977
– I’ve got to combine with fear being alone?

309
00:41:54,467 --> 00:41:58,067
– Don’t combine. Fear of being alone is different.

310
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:03,187
Just take it out fear of being alone in the night.

311
00:42:22,147 --> 00:42:36,130
Without fear of the dark. When he put as causation fright Stram. comes up,

312
00:42:36,384 --> 00:42:45,860
in spite of flat repertorization, VES says this is the remedy.

313
00:42:46,868 --> 00:43:28,946
Put fear of the dark. Therefore, this is a clear case of Stram.

314
00:43:30,115 --> 00:43:54,576
Who thought of Stram.? You need more education.

315
00:43:57,387 --> 00:44:06,347
– You said something about Con.?
– Forget it.

316
00:44:09,664 --> 00:44:12,747
– Here first things first.

317
00:44:16,064 --> 00:44:30,906
We don’t have here a woman where her ailments come because she had a great erotic life,

318
00:44:31,181 --> 00:44:36,945
sexual life and suddenly there is a divorce and she has to repress herself

319
00:44:37,217 --> 00:44:40,739
 and after that all the symptoms develop.

320
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:45,344
This is a case of Con. This is different here.

321
00:44:45,588 --> 00:44:54,820
Here we have a woman who out of absolute terror symptoms have developed and what are the symptoms?

322
00:44:57,108 --> 00:45:06,068
Except of the physical symptoms that do not indicate the remedy,

323
00:45:06,586 --> 00:45:10,944
if you take only the physical symptoms forget the remedy.

324
00:45:11,188 --> 00:45:32,186
You can never find it. It is interesting also that she does not go after she leaves home,

325
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:39,626
the terror is so much that she will not dare to make an affair.

326
00:45:39,895 --> 00:45:43,466
She is terrified by this idea.

327
00:45:43,984 --> 00:45:55,745
And only in the safety of a marriage then she accepts to have sexual intercourse again.

328
00:45:56,025 --> 00:46:04,464
That means this is not a case of Sep. Sep. is not interested

329
00:46:04,705 --> 00:46:14,455
and if she was a deep Sep. like her never had an orgasm that means she would never marry.

330
00:46:14,704 --> 00:46:17,381
It would not be necessary for her to marry.

331
00:46:17,627 --> 00:46:24,545
She would not feel inclination to get married at all.

332
00:46:26,341 --> 00:46:39,971
This is unfortunate, I thought 99% of the class would say Stram. I do not see that.

333
00:46:42,785 --> 00:46:53,025
Now the idea is what potency we shall give in such a case.

334
00:46:59,621 --> 00:47:21,627
You’ll start with 6X, 12X, 12C, 30C, 200C, 1M, 10M, 50M.

335
00:47:22,145 --> 00:47:26,501
Who will start very low? Nobody.

336
00:47:26,747 --> 00:47:29,571
12X? Nobody.

337
00:47:29,825 --> 00:47:32,624
12C? Nobody.

338
00:47:32,901 --> 00:48:05,904
30C? 7. 200C? 81! 1M? 19. 10M? 7. 50M? He is right!

339
00:48:09,377 --> 00:48:22,692
– But George she has quite a few organic defects and do you dare to give 50M is such a case?

340
00:48:22,985 --> 00:48:25,352
– Certainly not!

341
00:48:25,506 --> 00:48:34,212
– I said it just to see the reaction of the class!

342
00:48:34,471 --> 00:48:40,097
You should know me better by now!

343
00:48:41,846 --> 00:48:49,626
Sometimes I will say the wrong thing and I will see dead silence

344
00:48:49,726 --> 00:48:57,252
but nobody dares to challenge and say what are you talking about?

345
00:48:58,786 --> 00:49:09,788
Here as we say is the country of freedom. We go back to the challenge.

346
00:49:10,052 --> 00:49:17,217
That means whatever you know, you know. You should not be gullible.

347
00:49:17,468 --> 00:49:24,386
Because I can come as a teacher and tell you whatever I like.

348
00:49:24,386 --> 00:49:35,652
And you are going to swallow that. You go to teachers who tell lies, myths, stories without having any effect.

349
00:49:35,906 --> 00:49:41,026
And you believe them. No! You should challenge.

350
00:49:41,265 --> 00:49:48,706
Here is a deep pathology how you give 50M?

351
00:49:48,945 --> 00:49:55,406
You cannot give 50M because she may go into big reaction and what are you going to do?

352
00:49:56,897 --> 00:50:03,826
Therefore when you have a deep pathology on the physical level,

353
00:50:03,972 --> 00:50:05,703
here we have the combination,

354
00:50:05,903 --> 00:50:16,645
why most of you made a mistake because the problem is on an emotional level

355
00:50:16,745 --> 00:50:21,391
that means in order to touch the emotional level you have to go high

356
00:50:21,667 --> 00:50:33,187
but you can go high and you must go high if the physical body is in a condition to withstand the reaction.

357
00:50:33,426 --> 00:50:40,591
Here we have doubts whether the physical body is in a condition to withstand the reaction.

358
00:50:40,867 --> 00:50:48,271
Therefore we have to be careful and therefore we have to go quite low.

359
00:50:50,066 --> 00:50:58,018
Not here but here. We have to start carefully.

360
00:50:58,118 --> 00:51:01,347
At the same time she takes other drugs.

361
00:51:01,586 --> 00:51:12,098
These drugs are in the way that means to eventually counteract the homeopathic remedy.

362
00:51:12,344 --> 00:51:18,498
Therefore you have to give it repeatedly in order to counteract the chemical drugs

363
00:51:18,744 --> 00:51:27,186
which are used at the moment until the organism reaches such a condition that she will be able to dispense,

364
00:51:27,704 --> 00:51:33,904
get away from the remedies she is taking.

365
00:51:34,665 --> 00:51:41,584
So we have to go carefully and be patient and not expect from one day to another,

366
00:51:41,827 --> 00:51:47,704
it will take longer but it’s a much safer way of treating.

367
00:51:47,984 --> 00:51:54,021
Therefore, 12C. She can start 3 times a day.

368
00:51:54,267 --> 00:52:09,598
But every 10 days you have to raise the potency and go to 13C, 14C, 15C, 16C.

369
00:52:09,698 --> 00:52:14,454
Do you understand why this is a case of Stram.?

370
00:52:14,708 --> 00:52:40,825
Still there are some doubts. Show me this rubric.

371
00:52:41,871 --> 00:52:50,027
This is another rubric which is closer to ailments from fright.

372
00:52:54,178 --> 00:53:10,031
Ailments from fright with anger. Put this rubric instead of ailments from fright.

373
00:53:11,826 --> 00:53:19,267
Acon. also comes high in the repertorization because somebody might have thought,

374
00:53:19,524 --> 00:53:22,765
I have though that this case needs Acon.

375
00:53:23,788 --> 00:53:26,985
Why? Is this correct?

376
00:53:27,224 --> 00:53:32,767
Who can give me the differentiation between Acon. and Stram.?

377
00:53:32,867 --> 00:53:44,418
Why Stram. and not Acon.? I’ll tell you how this could be an Acon. case.

378
00:53:44,664 --> 00:53:48,258
It could have been an Acon. case if she would have come here

379
00:53:48,504 --> 00:54:05,667
and said that what is torturing her mostly at this moment is a fear of dying and dying quite soon.

380
00:54:05,906 --> 00:54:24,098
That means after the shock, in order to have an Acon. case, the symptom of Acon. is I am going to die!

381
00:54:24,591 --> 00:54:33,058
We didn’t hear it. Fear of dying also. Acon. will not say like that.

382
00:54:33,304 --> 00:54:40,984
Acon. will say it in a stronger way, fear of dying of Acon. is really fear of dying

383
00:54:41,231 --> 00:54:43,067
She has been near death.

384
00:54:43,185 --> 00:54:48,504
She says they have predicted I will die after 3 months, I did not die.

385
00:54:48,745 --> 00:54:58,369
This is not an Acon. Forget it. The moment a patient speaks this way concerning death...

386
00:54:58,469 --> 00:54:59,490
Of course she has fear of death.

387
00:54:59,744 --> 00:55:07,940
She said after I had all this pathology having fear of death is not the prominent symptom.

388
00:55:08,186 --> 00:55:13,026
What is the prominent symptom? It’s the anger.

389
00:55:15,348 --> 00:55:21,890
I want to kill. Acon. does not want to kill.

390
00:55:34,444 --> 00:55:48,260
But it is interesting that whatever way you can repertorize Acon. should come,

391
00:55:48,506 --> 00:55:50,820
except of course of flat repertorization.

392
00:55:51,066 --> 00:55:57,466
Flat repertorization will very seldom give you the remedy.

393
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:06,944
It means that the remedies which have most of the symptoms are the best. No.

394
00:56:07,188 --> 00:56:13,588
In Homeopathy we say totality of symptoms but actually we don’t have it.

395
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:22,050
We have totality of keynote symptoms. Which are the real keynote symptoms?

396
00:56:22,548 --> 00:56:27,668
There are the ones that will give you the answer to the case.

397
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:40,224
Not the totality. The totality sometimes will give you but actually seldom.

398
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:44,580
– What about syphilitic aspect of this case?

399
00:56:44,826 --> 00:56:52,260
With Stram. would you give after another remedy perhaps?

400
00:56:55,066 --> 00:57:12,468
– The idea of the miasms is the same as the idea of layers on which we are unfolding a case.

401
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:19,650
Always you go according to the symptoms to find the remedy.

402
00:57:19,952 --> 00:57:26,105
If you go according to a theory there are so many theories that you can produce

403
00:57:26,352 --> 00:57:29,427
that you will be totally confused in the end.

404
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:35,626
You have to go pragmatically, realistically, according to the symptomatology of the case.

405
00:57:35,865 --> 00:57:42,540
Get the symptomatology of the case, get the essence of the case and then you will find the remedy.

406
00:57:42,788 --> 00:57:51,500
And whether it fits on the syphilitic or on the sycotic it doesn’t matter.

407
00:57:51,748 --> 00:57:56,868
Syph. was given to her. For what reason?

408
00:57:57,186 --> 00:58:02,255
There is no reason for giving Syph. for such a case.

409
00:58:08,306 --> 00:58:14,032
If you go to idea of syphilis you give Merc. to the case.

410
00:58:14,308 --> 00:58:17,279
You can make a case anything you like,

411
00:58:17,379 --> 00:58:24,787
but the actual symptomatology of the case will lead you only the Stram.

412
00:58:25,059 --> 00:58:28,627
No other remedy.

413
00:58:33,293 --> 00:58:38,413
– What do you expect the remedy to do with her?
– Cure her?

414
00:58:38,664 --> 00:58:43,023
– Cure!
– No.

415
00:58:43,266 --> 00:58:44,546
– What do you expect?

416
00:58:44,797 --> 00:58:51,983
– I expect gradual improvement to what extent, I don’t know.

417
00:58:52,230 --> 00:59:03,625
I would expect for instance that the eruption will come out again in the nose,

418
00:59:03,864 --> 00:59:15,664
the saddle, that will be a good sign, I will expect that the heart will be better functioning,

419
00:59:15,907 --> 00:59:27,427
I will expect also that the retention will be better slowly.

420
00:59:28,184 --> 00:59:35,624
– And in the emotional level?
– On the emotional level; much improvement.

421
00:59:35,768 --> 00:59:43,548
– And what will be the last potency you would give her?

422
00:59:43,823 --> 00:59:49,174
– I don’t know because I will see how she will react on these potencies

423
00:59:49,428 --> 00:59:56,561
and if there is a relapse then we go higher.

424
00:59:57,366 --> 01:00:09,425
It’s not an easy case to handle! Give Portugal the opportunity.

425
01:00:09,425 --> 01:00:15,907
– Will there be any return of the headaches?

426
01:00:17,187 --> 01:00:40,444
– Yes but no dramatic aggravation will take place. Thank you very much!
