1
00:00:15,984 --> 00:00:18,984
You can tell what happens.

2
00:00:19,254 --> 00:00:21,544
- Thank you for seeing me. I’ve got shingles.

3
00:00:22,582 --> 00:00:29,985
– Where?
– On my back. Running from the back under my breast.

4
00:00:30,262 --> 00:00:32,304
– How long ago it started?

5
00:00:32,545 --> 00:00:40,737
- It started 2 weeks ago and the eruption has dried mostly,

6
00:00:40,984 --> 00:00:44,304
it is just marked, but it is the pain...

7
00:00:44,304 --> 00:00:45,857
- The pain is severe.

8
00:00:46,864 --> 00:00:52,748
– Yes. They pain is worse in the night and in the morning.

9
00:00:56,097 --> 00:01:00,428
– You mean in the night when you wake up or when you go to bed?

10
00:01:01,217 --> 00:01:06,828
- I go to sleep ok, especially here because it is more relaxing

11
00:01:08,624 --> 00:01:14,784
and I wake up after about 1-2 hours with the pain

12
00:01:15,024 --> 00:01:24,257
and then I go to sleep again and I wake up again in an hour or 2... About 3-4 times.

13
00:01:25,784 --> 00:01:29,104
– With pain... And in the morning when you wake up...

14
00:01:30,144 --> 00:01:39,864
- I have difficulty getting out of bed because I feel stiff. I have to be helped to sit up.

15
00:01:42,668 --> 00:01:46,224
– You are stiff all over the body?
– The back.

16
00:01:48,534 --> 00:01:51,344
– And you have to be helped to get up.

17
00:01:51,585 --> 00:01:57,864
– Yes. I can get up on my own by rolling on the side but to sit up...

18
00:01:58,134 --> 00:02:02,224
- And you feel stiff on your whole back.
– Yes.

19
00:02:06,344 --> 00:02:09,420
– Did you take some medication so far?
– Yes.

20
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,212
– What did you take?

21
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:20,344
– I took Rhus-t. 30C at the beginning.

22
00:02:23,424 --> 00:02:34,184
The next remedy was Ran-b. 30C.

23
00:02:35,704 --> 00:02:44,424
- You use the Latin pronunciation in your land.

24
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:49,100
– Yes. Bry. 30C which was recommended to me by a homeopath.

25
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,184
She wanted to have 200C but I didn’t have it on me at the time

26
00:02:55,707 --> 00:02:59,583
and she recommended me to get 200C next day

27
00:02:59,584 --> 00:03:08,300
but I called her back and told her I was cold and she suggested Ars. 200C.

28
00:03:17,494 --> 00:03:22,102
There’s been no change from remedies just a natural progression of the disease.

29
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:28,460
– The pain was continuous?
– The pain comes and goes.

30
00:03:28,972 --> 00:03:33,064
– This stiffness that you are talking about it was from the beginning

31
00:03:33,304 --> 00:03:37,144
or it became worse and worse as the days went by?

32
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,224
– The pain and stiffness is mostly when I am getting up.

33
00:03:40,492 --> 00:03:43,344
– But that was from the beginning?
– No.

34
00:03:44,865 --> 00:03:48,705
– The stiffness started how many days ago?

35
00:03:51,024 --> 00:03:58,945
– The last few days. I was in too much pain to really take notice.

36
00:03:59,222 --> 00:04:03,574
– You took painkillers?
– No.

37
00:04:07,222 --> 00:04:14,384
– And the pain has become worse and worse or is it more or less in the same level?

38
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:16,944
– The pain is less severe now.

39
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:24,588
– The stiffness is more?
– No. Only in the morning.

40
00:04:25,868 --> 00:04:32,268
– But you told me there was stiffness only in the morning. There was stiffness during the day as well?

41
00:04:33,057 --> 00:04:40,264
– Not a lot. The worst thing is jarring, from the beginning

42
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,900
and the touch of anything.

43
00:04:48,704 --> 00:04:51,532
 Even my hair hurts.

44
00:04:52,544 --> 00:04:56,140
– Even touching the hair made you feel worse?

45
00:04:57,144 --> 00:05:00,744
– One hair fell out on my breast and that hurt.

46
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:08,424
– Even touching your hair you felt pain?

47
00:05:08,664 --> 00:05:15,584
– No, it fell and the touch of the hair was painful.

48
00:05:15,852 --> 00:05:20,704
– What about if the touch was really strong?

49
00:05:21,464 --> 00:05:25,824
– At the beginning, no touch at all.

50
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:29,144
– You could not tolerate any touch.

51
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:38,893
– I wouldn’t let anybody near me but now it is not so severe.

52
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:49,184
– Now still jarring is aggravating.

53
00:05:49,453 --> 00:05:54,824
– Every step I make with the right foot, as the heel touches the ground, is painful.

54
00:05:57,624 --> 00:06:05,144
– Did you take Bell.?
– No, only the remedies I mentioned.

55
00:06:09,504 --> 00:06:14,424
– Did you have any other remedies ...

56
00:06:20,304 --> 00:06:24,417
before for homeopathic treatment?

57
00:06:24,664 --> 00:06:26,704
– Not for a long time.

58
00:06:27,744 --> 00:06:30,544
– Was any remedy that helped you in the past?

59
00:06:39,264 --> 00:06:48,780
– The only remedy that ever made any difference to me and I felt different was Carc. many years ago.

60
00:06:49,292 --> 00:06:57,464
And in an acute situation Sep. and Nat-m. 30Cs.

61
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:02,344
– Do you like salt?
– No, I never take salt.

62
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:11,820
– You dislike salt? Or it is normal? If the food is a little bit salty...

63
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:18,732
- I don’t like it. I am not used to it. I don’t use salt at all.

64
00:07:19,224 --> 00:07:24,784
– You’re health-conscious.
– Yes.

65
00:07:25,025 --> 00:07:28,104
– In your family you don’t use salt.

66
00:07:28,374 --> 00:07:36,054
–No. Only to pick up wine stains on the carpet as a cleaning agent.

67
00:07:42,454 --> 00:07:45,782
– What is your blood pressure?

68
00:07:46,024 --> 00:07:52,864
– Normal, maybe a little bit low. But I don’t test it, I don’t bother.

69
00:08:04,897 --> 00:08:09,504
– In general you would say you are bothered by heat or cold?

70
00:08:09,744 --> 00:08:23,824
- I am very chilly. The wind on my back from the open windows behind me down the stairs is painful.

71
00:08:24,344 --> 00:08:29,174
– That means you are sensitive to drafts.
– The skin is sensitive.

72
00:08:30,704 --> 00:08:33,505
– Now that you have shingles or before?

73
00:08:33,782 --> 00:08:39,905
– Now it’s the pain on the skin but normally I don’t like cold wind anyway.

74
00:08:44,534 --> 00:08:46,582
– Are you married?
– Yes.

75
00:08:46,824 --> 00:08:48,374
– Do you have children?
– Yes.

76
00:08:51,574 --> 00:08:55,414
– This dress that you have now seems to be very light.

77
00:08:56,944 --> 00:09:03,344
– But it is warm in Greece. I can get very hot quickly and very cold quickly.

78
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:12,822
– And then you would suffer from being very warm or you tolerate it?

79
00:09:13,825 --> 00:09:21,184
– I love the heat but when I am active physically I get hot quickly and don’t like it then.

80
00:09:21,424 --> 00:09:25,494
But I would rather have heat than cold anytime.

81
00:09:29,584 --> 00:09:30,864
I am not going back home!

82
00:09:35,862 --> 00:09:43,024
– Do you like milk?
– No, I never drink milk. Not from an animal.

83
00:09:46,184 --> 00:09:54,785
– Do you have certain preferences for food? Some real desire?

84
00:09:55,384 --> 00:09:59,744
– I love vegetables, fruits, salads.

85
00:10:02,304 --> 00:10:07,424
– You’re vegetarian?
– No. Fish.

86
00:10:08,704 --> 00:10:13,581
– What about sweets?
– Not specially.

87
00:10:14,344 --> 00:10:22,540
– Do you like eggs?
– I very rarely eat them but I don’t dislike them.

88
00:10:22,784 --> 00:10:24,014
– Your nails are strong?

89
00:10:24,264 --> 00:10:31,424
– They used to be but in the last few weeks or couples of months I noticed they started breaking

90
00:10:31,692 --> 00:10:35,532
and my hair is falling very badly.

91
00:10:35,784 --> 00:10:38,584
– The last 2 months?

92
00:10:38,584 --> 00:10:46,540
– The nails the last 2 months. The hair at least 3 years but worse now with the shingles.

93
00:10:48,332 --> 00:10:49,612
– Do you have any fears?

94
00:10:55,224 --> 00:10:57,304
– I don’t think so.

95
00:11:00,384 --> 00:11:07,788
I have 2 very strong aversions; one is the pig, I will not eat anything from the pig...

96
00:11:10,104 --> 00:11:12,908
- Are you Jewish?
– No.

97
00:11:14,704 --> 00:11:18,028
– It is not a matter of religion.
– No, because it is dirty.

98
00:11:20,588 --> 00:11:27,184
- So you developed this aversion after you saw the animals...?

99
00:11:27,457 --> 00:11:30,344
– No, when I found out what the pig was about.

100
00:11:36,744 --> 00:11:41,622
But I didn’t like it as a child either.

101
00:11:42,784 --> 00:11:44,584
And tobacco.

102
00:11:46,104 --> 00:11:50,220
– You don’t like somebody smoking near you?

103
00:11:50,465 --> 00:11:59,692
– Yes very strongly. I don’t like bad smells. But I like good smells very much.

104
00:12:01,612 --> 00:12:05,944
– And tobacco is a bad smell for you.
– Very bad.

105
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:14,412
– Some like it!
– No, it’s very bad. It makes me smell bad.

106
00:12:16,704 --> 00:12:21,064
– Do you have a special sensitivity to odors?

107
00:12:21,304 --> 00:12:24,384
– Very keen sense of smell.

108
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:42,824
– Can give me the type you are? Are you duty-bound? Easily irritated?

109
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:53,304
Very easily going into depression or anxiety? Anxious about your children?

110
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:59,980
– They say I am a workaholic but I can also be very easy going and very laid back.

111
00:13:00,492 --> 00:13:05,612
At the moment I am very slow because of the movement.

112
00:13:05,864 --> 00:13:09,704
– Would you say you are lazy?

113
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,576
– Nobody would think I am lazy, they say I am workaholic

114
00:13:15,825 --> 00:13:20,459
 but I think I can be lazy if I have the opportunity.

115
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:24,024
I don’t know... on the beach.

116
00:13:25,824 --> 00:13:31,212
– Before the shingles your sleep was good or it was interrupted?

117
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:40,151
– Very good what there was of it. I never get much sleep because I am always working.

118
00:13:41,452 --> 00:13:42,984
– Because you want to work?

119
00:13:44,012 --> 00:13:47,584
– Not so much want to, I have to. There’s so much to do.

120
00:13:49,132 --> 00:13:52,904
– So you don’t allow yourself to sleep enough.
– That’s right.

121
00:13:54,944 --> 00:14:00,064
– And how you manage with your energy?

122
00:14:00,824 --> 00:14:08,012
– My energy is good. But I have been so tired, I have been almost asleep during the day,

123
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:13,384
I am working at the same time, if that makes sense.

124
00:14:15,424 --> 00:14:18,700
– How can you do that?

125
00:14:21,772 --> 00:14:25,613
– I found I was asleep but I was still writing.

126
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:29,184
– In your sleep?
– In the day.

127
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:32,780
– Keep on writing in your sleep?

128
00:14:33,784 --> 00:14:37,900
– I noticed I couldn’t read what I have written and I was asleep as I was writing.

129
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:41,227
– You have been asleep and still continue to write?

130
00:14:41,466 --> 00:14:44,023
Correct?
– Yes.

131
00:14:44,024 --> 00:14:45,824
– And talked in your sleep?

132
00:14:46,092 --> 00:14:51,980
– I don’t talk in my sleep. This was during the day when I am working. I was so tired.

133
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:59,144
– And you could not remember what you wrote and you could not read...

134
00:14:59,904 --> 00:15:05,784
- ... what I have written because I have written it and I’ve gone into sleep as I was writing.

135
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:11,211
I was dreaming and then came back and realized what was happening.

136
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:15,019
Only a few seconds perhaps, I don’t know.

137
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:20,384
– Just because you felt very tired.
– Exhausted.

138
00:15:22,424 --> 00:15:27,544
– Your appetite is good?
– Always has been but through this illness it wasn’t so good.

139
00:15:33,184 --> 00:15:40,104
– Can you tell me if you can wear something around your neck which is tight?

140
00:15:40,344 --> 00:15:45,740
– I’d rather not. But if I was cold I probably would.

141
00:15:49,304 --> 00:15:57,772
– Do you know this zhivago, turtle neck?

142
00:15:58,024 --> 00:16:02,892
– I keep the room where I am working always warm so I don’t have to wear many clothes.

143
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:06,464
I don’t like to wear a lot of clothes.

144
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:13,132
– But can you stand wearing a bra?
– No, I can’t stand it.

145
00:16:15,424 --> 00:16:22,144
– What about in the waist? Wearing a belt?
– That’s ok.

146
00:16:26,504 --> 00:16:37,260
– If you had to wear a tie, could you or you would rather not?

147
00:16:37,504 --> 00:16:44,424
– I would probably do that, but if I was cold, I would put anything on.

148
00:16:50,304 --> 00:16:55,500
– How old are you?
– 45.

149
00:16:55,744 --> 00:17:02,144
– 35?
– Thank you! 45.

150
00:17:10,584 --> 00:17:14,944
– Your menses are still there? You have your menses?
– Yes.

151
00:17:15,212 --> 00:17:18,264
– How is it?
– No problem.

152
00:17:22,504 --> 00:17:27,624
– Do you have pain before menses?
– No, I don’t have any problems.

153
00:17:29,664 --> 00:17:34,264
– And your sexual desire is normal
 – Not at the moment.

154
00:17:36,332 --> 00:17:40,664
– You are not interested at all.
– Well, it’s the pain.

155
00:17:42,732 --> 00:17:48,258
– Can you tell me if you keep a special position for sleep?

156
00:17:48,258 --> 00:17:52,821
You sleep on the right side, on your left side?

157
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:57,174
– It’s difficult because sleeping on the right side is sleeping on the pain,

158
00:17:57,424 --> 00:18:04,854
sleeping on the back, where I would like to sleep is painful and sleeping on the healthy side is worse.

159
00:18:07,664 --> 00:18:10,224
It drags everything down.

160
00:18:11,745 --> 00:18:16,624
– Before this happened, in what position did you sleep?

161
00:18:16,865 --> 00:18:22,774
– Always on the left or on my back.

162
00:18:25,654 --> 00:18:36,144
– Do you always speak like this with low voice? Or sometimes you get animated and you speak loud?

163
00:18:36,904 --> 00:18:44,584
– I’m usually quiet spoken but with my family, if I have to get them in order, I can raise my voice.

164
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:50,742
– And then your children are afraid of you?

165
00:18:50,742 --> 00:18:57,142
– No, I find actually, if I really want to make a point, I’ll actually go quiet.

166
00:18:57,654 --> 00:19:01,985
It’s more effective. It works on my patients.

167
00:19:05,831 --> 00:19:11,464
– But all English people speak with this voice? Is it the culture?

168
00:19:13,014 --> 00:19:17,104
– No, I think I am considered to be quiet spoken.

169
00:19:18,384 --> 00:19:25,302
– But you are trained. I understand you trained yourself to speak on low voice.

170
00:19:25,544 --> 00:19:27,784
– No, this is natural for me.

171
00:19:30,344 --> 00:19:34,184
But at home I am a little bit different.

172
00:19:34,454 --> 00:19:39,824
– With your friends are you loquacious?
– I am a Gemini.

173
00:19:40,065 --> 00:19:48,264
– So you want to speak all the time. What means a Gemini? I don’t understand.

174
00:19:51,862 --> 00:19:58,262
– If I know people then I am the soul of the party. If I don’t know people I am quiet.

175
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:02,102
– Now, you don’t know me, you’re quiet.

176
00:20:02,465 --> 00:20:05,028
– I know you a little bit. I‘ve been here before.

177
00:20:10,664 --> 00:20:15,024
– Is there any problem with constipation or diarrhea?

178
00:20:17,825 --> 00:20:26,546
– Since my first marriage break up, I’ve been a bit erratic. I go too much.

179
00:20:27,304 --> 00:20:38,104
– You go 2-3 times?
– Maybe. I got used to it.

180
00:20:39,384 --> 00:20:42,704
– The stool is formed or unformed?

181
00:20:42,977 --> 00:20:49,377
– Unformed usually. Better with this illness.

182
00:20:56,268 --> 00:21:04,465
– During this time, these 2 weeks, has anything changed in your desire to eat?

183
00:21:08,064 --> 00:21:09,857
– I have no appetite.

184
00:21:10,864 --> 00:21:16,065
– No appetite for anything. Maybe you have appetite for something,

185
00:21:16,864 --> 00:21:25,580
 like ice cream or sweets or oranges or...

186
00:21:26,584 --> 00:21:32,744
Has anything changed or you just lost your appetite?

187
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:38,987
– Before the eruption came up I had a gall bladder attack.

188
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:42,983
 The pain was underneath here, going like that.

189
00:21:42,984 --> 00:21:51,024
And so I was very careful with what I was eating, but I had no other symptoms, no vomiting, nothing.

190
00:21:51,265 --> 00:21:58,704
So I decided to have a pizza to find out if it was the gall bladder or not and I felt better afterwards.

191
00:21:58,945 --> 00:22:03,824
– After pizza?
– Yes, I don’t eat like that normally, but I felt better.

192
00:22:04,342 --> 00:22:07,414
– So you eat pizza everyday now?
– No, just that once.

193
00:22:17,384 --> 00:22:24,054
– If you want to make a point, you will make your point or you’d rather keep quiet?

194
00:22:26,104 --> 00:22:31,504
– It depends on where I am and whether I am in charge of the situation.

195
00:22:31,504 --> 00:22:35,617
If it’s with my patients, I will make the point very clear.

196
00:22:37,664 --> 00:22:43,544
– You said you have been divorced for the first time and then you re-married?
– Yes.

197
00:22:46,704 --> 00:22:54,902
– Do you think that the first divorce was your fault or his?

198
00:22:56,694 --> 00:23:03,104
– There are always 2 sides of a story. He’d say it was my fault, I’d say it was his fault.

199
00:23:03,104 --> 00:23:05,664
We were not right for each other.

200
00:23:05,664 --> 00:23:09,772
– What was your complain concerning him mostly?

201
00:23:16,424 --> 00:23:26,664
– I think the biggest thing was that he didn’t regard me as a woman. I was just a friend.

202
00:23:26,904 --> 00:23:28,704
– He just ignored you or...?

203
00:23:28,972 --> 00:23:32,544
– When the children were born I wasn’t important any more.

204
00:23:34,344 --> 00:23:42,144
– So you felt...
- Neglected I suppose. I was just a useful friend.

205
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:47,784
– During that time if you said something, would he listen?

206
00:23:48,812 --> 00:23:54,424
– No, he never listened to anything. He had a big newspaper in front of him and that was it.

207
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,260
– Never mind what you were saying.

208
00:23:58,264 --> 00:24:01,612
– I could be changing in front of him and he would not notice I was there.

209
00:24:03,384 --> 00:24:09,024
I was too young to put up with that. My husband now is very different.

210
00:24:14,144 --> 00:24:21,304
– You have a good relationship with your husband now?
– Yes, he is also a Gemini.

211
00:24:24,384 --> 00:24:30,784
– You know astrology?
– Only where it seems to be right...

212
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:38,732
- You are supposed to be compatible if you are both Gemini?

213
00:24:38,984 --> 00:24:44,704
– They say that Gemini are in 2 places, doing 2 thing at the same time

214
00:24:44,948 --> 00:24:46,625
when now in our house it’s 4 things,

215
00:24:46,869 --> 00:24:53,025
and my son is a Gemini and the cat is Gemini, so it’s pretty crazy.

216
00:25:01,221 --> 00:25:04,784
– The problem is how to treat your shingles now.

217
00:25:05,741 --> 00:25:12,903
 No matter whether you are a Gemini or not, it’s not important.

218
00:25:13,504 --> 00:25:19,944
– I am afraid that the eruption will go away but I will be left with pain for a long time

219
00:25:20,984 --> 00:25:23,024
because it can happen with shingles.

220
00:25:27,384 --> 00:25:32,504
– Your father was mistreating you or he was ok?

221
00:25:33,024 --> 00:25:36,024
– I knew you would ask about my father eventually!

222
00:25:39,024 --> 00:25:46,977
He was strict... I didn’t love him very much.

223
00:25:50,029 --> 00:25:56,944
He was a workaholic. I didn’t see him a lot and I was glad when he wasn’t there.

224
00:25:57,217 --> 00:25:58,584
– Were you afraid of him?

225
00:25:59,104 --> 00:26:02,144
– Yes. He always made me work whenever he saw me.

226
00:26:03,425 --> 00:26:10,623
 He always wanted to make sure that I was working. It didn’t work out.

227
00:26:10,624 --> 00:26:13,704
– You didn’t get much affection from him.

228
00:26:14,464 --> 00:26:17,784
– No. I got a hiding or two. Not a lot of love.

229
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:48,460
Well, we have a general rule how to look upon such acute cases.

230
00:26:49,464 --> 00:27:01,772
The rule is that if the acute condition gives you a clear picture, you give this remedy for the acute.

231
00:27:02,264 --> 00:27:07,384
If the acute condition does not give you a clear picture,

232
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:16,864
then you will most probably have to investigate deeper to find out what is the deeper indicated remedy

233
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:19,424
which most probably will act.

234
00:27:22,744 --> 00:27:31,105
So, if we go in this case, my question is again the same,

235
00:27:31,624 --> 00:27:37,014
is this a clear cut acute case of shingles?

236
00:27:39,062 --> 00:27:53,904
Several remedies have been prescribed, quite carefully I would say, so no effect.

237
00:27:59,265 --> 00:28:05,664
Are we missing the acute or do we have to go deeper?

238
00:28:08,984 --> 00:28:10,017
This is the first question.

239
00:28:12,304 --> 00:28:19,984
We cannot answer it on a theoretical basis. We can only answer it according to facts.

240
00:28:20,257 --> 00:28:23,308
Which are the facts? The facts are the symptoms.

241
00:28:23,584 --> 00:28:34,584
What the symptoms are telling us and always base your prescription on the real symptomatology.

242
00:28:35,864 --> 00:28:44,577
Don’t project your imagination, your fears, and your anxieties into the patient.

243
00:28:46,104 --> 00:28:54,028
You ask a patient something and he answers. That answer you have to take it as correct.

244
00:28:55,308 --> 00:29:02,988
If the answer is ambiguous, you are entitled to ask more questions to make it clear.

245
00:29:03,264 --> 00:29:11,464
Otherwise don’t make imaginary symptomatology.

246
00:29:13,505 --> 00:29:21,185
Because the moment you see this person you can project anything you like to her.

247
00:29:21,185 --> 00:29:27,094
She has suffered, she has not suffered, she is this and that, she has fears but she is not aware...

248
00:29:30,934 --> 00:29:38,344
You can make anything you like. The facts are only what she gave.

249
00:29:38,614 --> 00:29:44,502
She gave certain symptoms on which you have to work and only then you may have an effect.

250
00:29:51,144 --> 00:30:00,865
Ask some questions to see if you have found any remedy which is indicated in this case.

251
00:30:01,655 --> 00:30:10,614
Have you found any remedy which fit the acute condition? Who has found?

252
00:30:24,944 --> 00:30:35,944
– Initially I was thinking of Bell. but very much worse by jar in the case. Or Mez.

253
00:30:37,224 --> 00:30:45,201
– Why Mez.?
– The sensitiveness to touch, falling hair and neuralgia.

254
00:30:47,308 --> 00:30:56,912
– Mez. is sensitive to touch on the hair, it’s different.

255
00:30:57,188 --> 00:31:02,176
 What she says is, if the hair touches the place.

256
00:31:02,177 --> 00:31:10,024
That is different. That is worse with the least touch. This is the symptom.

257
00:31:11,544 --> 00:31:22,060
Mez. has a great sensitivity on the scalp and even if you touch the hair the pain is felt in the scalp.

258
00:31:27,692 --> 00:31:36,652
Bell. is a possibility because of worse touch and worse jar,

259
00:31:36,904 --> 00:31:45,344
but there is another remedy which is worse touch and worse jar, which is Lach.

260
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:11,980
– Mag-c.? Worse cold, worse hot and there is kind of neuralgic pains, worse touch...

261
00:32:17,344 --> 00:32:26,572
- It’s a little bit far out your suggestion. You will see here the real facts.

262
00:32:26,824 --> 00:32:34,504
That means you have to repertorize the information which you are given.

263
00:32:35,532 --> 00:32:41,664
Either with computer or by hand you have to repertorize and see what is the remedy

264
00:32:41,932 --> 00:32:45,260
which covers mostly this symptomatology.

265
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:53,452
So, skin eruptions, pain, sleep on waking, put some more symptoms.

266
00:32:57,292 --> 00:33:08,024
Generals jar on stepping, underlined 3 times, stiffness in the morning on rising

267
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:12,384
and touch aggravates and general drafts aggravates.

268
00:33:12,904 --> 00:33:18,135
And if you repertorize this with these symptoms,

269
00:33:18,384 --> 00:33:26,964
which is the remedy which will come up? Can anybody tell me?

270
00:33:30,024 --> 00:33:35,664
– Lach.
– Lach. Let’s see if it is Lach.

271
00:33:44,104 --> 00:33:50,824
Lach. is quite prominent in this case.

272
00:33:52,104 --> 00:34:00,822
This was the reason why I was investigating the aggravation from clothing.

273
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:13,104
Lach. women cannot tolerate wearing something tight around their breast and around their neck.

274
00:34:15,905 --> 00:34:25,654
The only problem is that Lach. is a warm remedy. It’s aggravated by warmth, not by cold.

275
00:34:26,145 --> 00:34:37,665
She insisted that she is cold and Kali-c. as a second possibility is an interesting possibility

276
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:40,225
because it is a cold remedy.

277
00:34:41,505 --> 00:34:48,624
Let’s see why; because Kali-c. has pain on waking,

278
00:34:51,425 --> 00:34:59,894
has the stiffness, has the jar, the touch and the draft.

279
00:35:06,785 --> 00:35:12,824
And she is a workaholic.

280
00:35:14,892 --> 00:35:24,344
Kali-c. are people who like to work, who actually work because of their sense of duty.

281
00:35:24,864 --> 00:35:31,224
They have too much sense of duty and they work because of that.

282
00:35:35,777 --> 00:35:52,144
When we added some symptoms in the repertorization, hair falling, complaints of brittle nails,

283
00:35:54,704 --> 00:36:09,304
aversion pork, sensitive to odors, mania for work, general side right, aggravates right side.

284
00:36:13,904 --> 00:36:24,704
Actually take it out because this is now worse on the left side, even worse she said on the left side.

285
00:36:28,428 --> 00:36:46,348
Don’t be afraid of these wasps! These big ones they don’t sting!

286
00:36:50,464 --> 00:37:14,264
And always we have remedies against the wasps. Show me this step!

287
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:26,445
This step shows that Lach. still is the first remedy, Ars., Sep., Merc., Ign., Caust., Bell.,

288
00:37:26,545 --> 00:37:33,452
Coff., Kali-c., Chin., Staph., Nat-m. etc.

289
00:37:41,388 --> 00:37:48,823
Vario. also stands in the medium remedies, it’s a possibility.

290
00:37:48,824 --> 00:37:57,265
Explain why. Because of herpetic eruptions and sensitive to odors.

291
00:38:04,304 --> 00:38:11,985
So, what is your decision so far?

292
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:27,105
Lach. stands very much ahead of other remedies but the problem is the heat and cold.

293
00:38:27,382 --> 00:38:34,294
– I think we don’t know so much of the time before it starts.

294
00:38:34,544 --> 00:38:37,864
She didn’t say anything of what happened before.

295
00:38:37,864 --> 00:38:44,264
Was there any trouble or something like this?

296
00:38:44,534 --> 00:38:48,624
– She is here she can tell.

297
00:38:48,865 --> 00:38:59,382
Can you tell us if something extraordinary, a stress happened before these shingles?

298
00:38:59,624 --> 00:39:02,761
Did you get very tired? Did you get a cold?

299
00:39:02,861 --> 00:39:12,968
Did you have a fight with your husband? Did you get jealous?

300
00:39:24,504 --> 00:39:36,384
– No. There has been no fight but in the last 3 years I have been working really very hard

301
00:39:36,656 --> 00:39:41,161
 because apart from my clinic,

302
00:39:41,261 --> 00:39:49,584
which has always been full time, I took on a school of Herbalism and Homeopathy

303
00:39:49,857 --> 00:39:56,748
which was going bankrupt because there was nobody else to do it and I worked all hours,

304
00:39:57,024 --> 00:40:01,624
day and night, sometimes all night, several nights a week.

305
00:40:01,868 --> 00:40:08,024
I tried to save the organization, which I have almost single-handed.

306
00:40:08,268 --> 00:40:11,329
I’ve got a good team but they don’t have the time,

307
00:40:11,429 --> 00:40:20,576
so if something needs to be done it’s always me and I am just exhausted.

308
00:40:20,577 --> 00:40:24,417
This is a sufficient reason to have shingles.

309
00:40:24,664 --> 00:40:37,744
– She was exhausted, her energy dropped and then she developed the symptoms.

310
00:40:42,102 --> 00:40:56,460
– I found another strange thing. She is a woman who works very hard and has a lot of energy for her work

311
00:40:58,252 --> 00:41:05,664
but what struck me was this voice. This muffled voice.

312
00:41:05,664 --> 00:41:13,612
– Low?
– Yes. And when you look at this symptom there is Lach., not Kali-c.

313
00:41:13,864 --> 00:41:17,944
– What symptom did you look?
– Voice muffled.

314
00:41:19,224 --> 00:41:54,464
– What does muffled exactly mean? Who is English? It means low?
– Indistinct.

315
00:41:54,704 --> 00:41:59,308
– So is this muffled?
– No.

316
00:41:59,584 --> 00:42:10,184
– What you are looking is a symptom of Lach. where it says mumbled.

317
00:42:11,564 --> 00:42:19,284
This type is the Lach. It’s not the low voice.

318
00:42:19,384 --> 00:42:27,904
If she speaks clearly but very low, this is not Lach. Lach. is a mumble.

319
00:42:28,172 --> 00:42:37,178
I make it a little bit exaggerated but there is the type of voice

320
00:42:37,427 --> 00:42:50,023
 that you feel is going to have a brain stroke very soon.

321
00:42:50,024 --> 00:42:56,182
Most probably you found that symptom.

322
00:43:00,784 --> 00:43:08,464
The Lach. symptomatology is strong apart from 2 things;

323
00:43:08,705 --> 00:43:31,504
one is the cold and the heat which does not fit and the other which does not fit with Lach. is what?

324
00:43:31,745 --> 00:43:37,654
– She is not loquacious.

325
00:43:37,904 --> 00:43:46,344
– Maybe. Another one? She said she sleeps on her left side.

326
00:43:46,614 --> 00:43:50,784
Lach. usually would sleep on their right side because

327
00:43:51,056 --> 00:43:55,663
 if they sleep on the left they have heart problems;

328
00:43:55,664 --> 00:44:03,004
palpitation, dyspnea, dysphoria and immediately they turn to the right side.

329
00:44:03,104 --> 00:44:07,604
So Lach. does not sleep usually on the left side.

330
00:44:07,704 --> 00:44:13,260
She says I prefer to sleep on the left side.

331
00:44:13,504 --> 00:44:28,104
At this moment she says even on the left, or on the right is worse because it seems the pain is worse.

332
00:44:28,344 --> 00:44:42,644
This symptom is in between. What shall we do? We are stuck now.

333
00:44:43,012 --> 00:44:51,852
Let’s see the next step. Mind speech, soft voice, stool soft.

334
00:44:52,104 --> 00:45:13,344
This is the last. Show me! Lach. is still strong.

335
00:45:13,591 --> 00:45:25,384
How much have you underlined this symptom?

336
00:45:36,224 --> 00:45:44,664
Tight clothes aggravate. Put that symptom. Underline it once.

337
00:45:55,937 --> 00:46:06,424
– I think it’s very important that the pain gets worse, when she sleeps on the painless side.

338
00:46:06,668 --> 00:46:10,724
– Yes, sleeping on the painless side.

339
00:46:10,997 --> 00:46:24,564
Put this! The symptom is lying on the painless side aggravates in generals.

340
00:46:26,085 --> 00:46:37,424
Let’s ask her a question since I did not want to put this question inside to guide or misguide you.

341
00:46:37,942 --> 00:46:42,685
Ask her whether she considers herself jealous.

342
00:46:42,785 --> 00:46:50,924
What is the answer? Write down the answer, what she is going to say.

343
00:46:51,024 --> 00:46:53,224
I ask, are you jealous?

344
00:46:53,494 --> 00:46:59,382
What she is going to answer? Write it down.

345
00:47:08,342 --> 00:47:36,225
Everybody must write. Ok, tell now. I have absolutely no reason to be jealous.

346
00:47:36,502 --> 00:47:45,057
I wouldn’t permit a situation where I would have to be jealous. I’m too sure of myself.

347
00:47:46,584 --> 00:47:49,388
– You would not permit, what do you mean?

348
00:47:49,664 --> 00:47:58,348
– I would not permit a situation where I would have to be jealous.

349
00:48:01,424 --> 00:48:09,624
– But she said that when her children were born, she wasn’t any more important to her husband.

350
00:48:09,868 --> 00:48:15,404
– No, this was the first husband. She is talking about the second husband.

351
00:48:15,404 --> 00:48:20,564
– Yes, but I say she was jealous with her first husband.

352
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:25,682
– I don’t know if she was jealous. She was ignored.

353
00:48:25,782 --> 00:48:40,464
– No, I wasn’t jealous. Just neglected. I don’t think I was aware of it at the time.

354
00:48:43,024 --> 00:48:50,704
– Who wrote she was going to say she was jealous?

355
00:48:50,999 --> 00:49:01,744
Who wrote she is not jealous? Who wrote nothing?

356
00:49:06,344 --> 00:49:17,622
You see the problem? We have a strong case of Lach. Quite strong.

357
00:49:17,864 --> 00:49:28,704
With characteristics of Lach. yet, we are missing the loquacity, the jealousy,

358
00:49:28,972 --> 00:49:32,812
we thought we were also missing the sleeping on the left side.

359
00:49:33,064 --> 00:49:45,612
Now she said no, I used to sleep on my right side, which is Lach.

360
00:49:52,780 --> 00:50:02,504
The shingles also, we would prefer to be on the left side, not on the right side.

361
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:09,932
You have to mix 3 remedies before you can make all the symptoms.

362
00:50:10,184 --> 00:50:22,732
So what you do? You search your mind and your repertory.

363
00:50:22,984 --> 00:50:28,104
So, here we have strong indication for Lach.

364
00:50:28,864 --> 00:50:40,744
Apart from the fact she is aggravated by cold, there is no problem with PMS.

365
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:47,864
It is very seldom that you will find a Lach. that will not have a PMS.

366
00:50:49,142 --> 00:50:58,344
That means in the sexual sphere she is functioning quite normally.

367
00:50:58,614 --> 00:51:10,497
– What about her perspiration? – She has lots of perspiration?

368
00:51:18,177 --> 00:51:25,368
– No, it’s normal and I don’t use any deodorants. I think it’s a bad thing to do.

369
00:51:29,588 --> 00:51:40,344
– So, you are stuck, you don’t know what to do. Give Lach. and see what happens!

370
00:51:42,864 --> 00:51:48,427
Because of these counter indications you have to search other remedies

371
00:51:48,666 --> 00:51:57,131
to see how many of her symptoms other remedies have.

372
00:51:57,132 --> 00:52:03,532
– Perhaps I should say that I do have one fear although is not present at the moment.

373
00:52:03,784 --> 00:52:08,384
I fear that I may have a stroke because it runs in the family.

374
00:52:08,652 --> 00:52:15,544
My mother had a stroke at 76, my grandmother had a stroke at 76

375
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:19,926
and I was relieved in a way that I had shingles and I feel relieved it

376
00:52:20,026 --> 00:52:26,059
 and perhaps that’s how I sort my problems out.

377
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:35,784
– Another issue that did not fit with Lach. was the fact that she has low blood pressure.

378
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:40,625
Usually when this Lach. situation is in the organism,

379
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:47,819
 there is an internal pressure which rises the blood pressure.

380
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:52,172
She says I have low blood pressure.

381
00:52:52,424 --> 00:53:07,624
Again a symptom which is against Lach. Show me the columns!

382
00:53:07,724 --> 00:53:14,210
Let’s investigate some other remedies before we decide to see how many of her symptoms

383
00:53:14,464 --> 00:53:17,263
 are covered by different other remedies.

384
00:53:17,264 --> 00:53:35,948
Let’s say Ign. Ign. covers 13, covers industrious, mania for work.

385
00:53:36,224 --> 00:53:40,534
I don’t know if this really is a symptom.

386
00:53:41,025 --> 00:53:48,085
She had to work all this time but this is not something I would consider as a symptom.

387
00:53:48,262 --> 00:53:52,864
You have to take it out actually.

388
00:53:55,148 --> 00:54:04,752
Sensitive to odors, low soft voice, hair falling, soft stool,

389
00:54:05,028 --> 00:54:10,263
stiffness on the back in the morning on rising.

390
00:54:10,264 --> 00:54:22,544
Take out stiffness on back let alone stiffness in the morning on rising.

391
00:54:22,817 --> 00:54:35,344
Extremities nails, brittle nails, pain on waking, herpetic zoster, draft of air aggravates,

392
00:54:35,617 --> 00:54:41,228
intolerance of clothing, pressure of clothing.

393
00:54:54,817 --> 00:55:01,984
Just put neck only, underline it once.

394
00:55:02,148 --> 00:55:08,984
Aversion pork, stepping aggravates, 3 times that’s good.

395
00:55:09,772 --> 00:55:16,824
Lying on painless side aggravates. Show me now the general repertorization.

396
00:55:18,864 --> 00:55:28,864
The expert system. With the corrections.

397
00:55:29,104 --> 00:55:49,584
Caust. Let’s see, it covers 10 of her symptoms... Dreams.

398
00:55:49,704 --> 00:55:53,224
- About dreaming of snakes or something?

399
00:55:53,464 --> 00:56:00,944
– She has nothing in particular.
– Nothing special.

400
00:56:03,745 --> 00:56:10,934
– Show me the columns! Investigate the next remedy.

401
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:25,505
Nat-m. Show me the next remedy.

402
00:56:26,785 --> 00:56:34,465
Bell. Show me the next remedy.

403
00:56:35,745 --> 00:56:41,654
Ign. Show me the next remedy.

404
00:56:42,422 --> 00:56:47,024
Staph. Show me the next remedy.

405
00:56:55,222 --> 00:57:08,534
Lach. But she has no other symptoms of Merc. Show me Merc.

406
00:57:08,784 --> 00:57:11,308
How many symptoms does it cover?

407
00:57:30,304 --> 00:57:43,372
– Sep. She mentioned it helped her in the past and it has 10 symptoms.

408
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:59,222
– Sep. She didn’t say she has aversion to sex.

409
00:57:59,464 --> 00:58:08,695
She says I am feeling very painful and that’s why I try to avoid it.

410
00:58:08,944 --> 00:58:14,824
– Instead of taking so many symptoms why we do not take 4-5 very important ones

411
00:58:15,094 --> 00:58:19,504
that are very close towards the patient and may only give us a few remedies.

412
00:58:19,745 --> 00:58:20,684
– Which are these?

413
00:58:20,784 --> 00:58:23,307
– I would give importance to the aversion to pork,

414
00:58:23,546 --> 00:58:29,543
 the since childhood is a very strong feeling in her...

415
00:58:29,544 --> 00:58:33,654
- Ok, first of all this is not a real aversion.

416
00:58:33,904 --> 00:58:39,024
It is after she had seen what all pork is about.

417
00:58:39,269 --> 00:58:44,910
That is not a real aversion to pork, as we know it with Puls.

418
00:58:45,174 --> 00:58:54,134
The aversion became out of seeing this condition,

419
00:58:54,384 --> 00:59:03,094
but you can still take it but not as a strong and important symptom. The second?

420
00:59:03,344 --> 00:59:07,702
– Tobacco. When somebody is smoking a cigarette she does not like it.

421
00:59:07,944 --> 00:59:17,174
– Not even that. Because she said, not only tobacco, it is any smell which is not nice.

422
00:59:17,424 --> 00:59:22,246
Tobacco included. That means smells I don’t like

423
00:59:22,346 --> 00:59:28,393
because I have an acute smell and you can take it as acute smell.

424
00:59:28,394 --> 00:59:32,484
But aversion tobacco is not a special aversion.

425
00:59:32,721 --> 00:59:39,105
Aversion to all smells which do not have a nice smell.

426
00:59:41,424 --> 00:59:47,660
Therefore you can take tobacco but not give special importance.

427
00:59:47,904 --> 00:59:51,500
– I’m not. Also the neglected feeling.

428
00:59:51,744 --> 01:00:01,464
– Neglected feeling is something which existed in the past and does not have it now.

429
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:06,344
Now, ask her, she has a good relation.

430
01:00:06,584 --> 01:00:13,260
She says my relation now is quite good and compatible.

431
01:00:13,504 --> 01:00:17,864
She explained compatibility by Gemini or something,

432
01:00:18,104 --> 01:00:25,024
which I don’t understand but anyhow she said at this moment

433
01:00:25,544 --> 01:00:31,944
I am happy with the second marriage which was totally different than the first one.

434
01:00:32,184 --> 01:00:34,508
In this marriage I don’t feel neglected.

435
01:00:35,024 --> 01:00:41,184
On the contrary I feel I am being taking care of, perhaps too much.

436
01:00:41,697 --> 01:00:44,744
Is this correct? Yes.

437
01:00:44,984 --> 01:00:49,100
She says very good analysis. So, next.

438
01:00:49,344 --> 01:00:52,664
– The fear of apoplexy, the fear of getting paralyzed.

439
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,024
– The fear of getting apoplexy.

440
01:00:54,264 --> 01:00:58,104
Again, this is not a main symptom,

441
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:04,406
because she said my mother had an apoplexy at young age

442
01:01:05,466 --> 01:01:12,971
and I have the fear because of that event that I may also have.

443
01:01:12,972 --> 01:01:22,700
Still there is a kind of symptom there but not a strong symptom to base a prescription.

444
01:01:22,944 --> 01:01:29,344
The symptoms which are really strong are worse jar.

445
01:01:29,612 --> 01:01:36,780
This is something which you have to have it in the worse stepping;

446
01:01:37,024 --> 01:01:45,224
with every step she has a pain. This is something very strong.

447
01:01:45,471 --> 01:01:50,864
Then, the next thing is the worse touch.

448
01:01:51,137 --> 01:01:57,068
From a pathology point of view these symptoms are important.

449
01:01:57,584 --> 01:02:05,268
Now, from a psychological point of view she says I don’t have any fears

450
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:15,488
 except of that fear that I may get a stroke.

451
01:02:17,057 --> 01:02:24,417
But touch aggravates has to be 3 times.

452
01:02:28,257 --> 01:02:34,664
So what is the remedy?

453
01:02:36,705 --> 01:02:41,344
– Can I ask how is the expression of her emotions,

454
01:02:41,612 --> 01:02:46,220
I don’t know whether you’ve had a loss in the family and you were able to express your grief

455
01:02:46,464 --> 01:02:54,412
or any other strong even and do you express your feelings easily or you tend to be closed?

456
01:03:03,104 --> 01:03:11,304
– I lost my mother about 10 years ago and I miss her a lot but I think I coped well.

457
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:16,724
The biggest grief was 3 years ago with this college

458
01:03:16,824 --> 01:03:26,177
that I took and all these that took place at the time. I was grieving a lot then.

459
01:03:26,944 --> 01:03:30,017
– Do you like fruits?

460
01:03:30,508 --> 01:03:34,584
– Yes, but only when the weather is warm.

461
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:39,704
I don’t like cold food when it’s cold.

462
01:03:41,124 --> 01:03:44,444
– When the weather is warm she likes fruits.

463
01:03:45,612 --> 01:03:52,183
– I eat seasonally if possible, so in the winter I eat hot vegetables

464
01:03:52,424 --> 01:03:57,769
and in the summer I eat salads.

465
01:04:00,374 --> 01:04:05,665
– You have fruits in your house?
– Yes, in the summer.

466
01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:15,414
– And you will peel an apple and eat it or an orange?

467
01:04:15,905 --> 01:04:17,974
– I don’t eat citrus fruits.

468
01:04:18,465 --> 01:04:23,094
– Why? Because they are sour?

469
01:04:23,344 --> 01:04:31,784
– Because they are not indigenous in Britain, they don’t grow there, we should not be eating them.

470
01:04:32,054 --> 01:04:39,734
I try to eat what is right. I eat what grows in England.

471
01:04:42,162 --> 01:04:50,060
– Out of philosophical belief or out of taste?

472
01:04:50,304 --> 01:04:53,624
– It just makes sense to me.

473
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:58,508
– Philosophy.
– Yes.

474
01:04:58,784 --> 01:05:05,424
– Your philosophy is that it’s better to eat season fruits and local fruits than anything else.

475
01:05:05,697 --> 01:05:10,028
– I wouldn’t fancy a glass of orange juice in the middle of the winter.

476
01:05:16,344 --> 01:05:33,504
– Bring the columns. Explain why! Staph.

477
01:05:34,024 --> 01:05:42,746
Has the touch aggravates 3 times, right side, stepping, jarring, herpetic eruptions,

478
01:05:43,010 --> 01:05:49,624
 pain with waking, stiffness in the morning on rising, hair falling soft stool, low, soft voice,

479
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:57,627
sensitive to odors and if you had done your repertorization properly,

480
01:05:57,902 --> 01:06:04,203
 you would have come to this remedy,

481
01:06:04,204 --> 01:06:26,934
which is not only indicated at the moment, but the story she says, I was left alone to finish the job.

482
01:06:27,184 --> 01:06:32,666
This already is a kind of suppression but what is interesting,

483
01:06:32,930 --> 01:06:36,491
 is the story she tells about the first husband.

484
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:39,344
She could not talk to him.

485
01:06:42,422 --> 01:06:53,324
We have said that in the pathology of Staph. are very nice, sensitive people, full of emotions,

486
01:06:53,424 --> 01:07:00,584
they don’t lose their emotions but they cannot find their right.

487
01:07:00,854 --> 01:07:06,744
They cannot speak out, they cannot tell to hell with you, you are a bastard...

488
01:07:08,544 --> 01:07:18,264
They just cannot reach that point where they could say that.

489
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:26,220
Unless they are even beaten by the husbands, suppressed by the parents. You remember?

490
01:07:26,732 --> 01:07:33,385
She gave the story, I didn’t want to make it very clear for you,

491
01:07:33,624 --> 01:07:42,186
that’s why in the investigation I did not give enough indications

492
01:07:42,455 --> 01:07:48,223
 so you can battle with finding the correct remedy.

493
01:07:48,224 --> 01:07:54,892
So the correct remedy which fits actually the local symptom, which is worse cold also,

494
01:07:55,384 --> 01:08:02,060
which also fits some of her pathology coming from the past,

495
01:08:02,304 --> 01:08:12,812
that means we have here a remedy which not only will take care of the shingles

496
01:08:13,064 --> 01:08:16,332
but will take care of her psychological state as well.

497
01:08:16,584 --> 01:08:20,940
She will feel much better psychologically as well.

498
01:08:21,452 --> 01:08:28,104
If we had found a remedy let us say Bell. or Lach., or Kali-c.,

499
01:08:28,344 --> 01:08:37,824
that would take the pain slowly away but would not touch the emotional sphere.

500
01:08:38,092 --> 01:08:43,212
With Staph. we don’t have counter indications.

501
01:08:43,464 --> 01:08:50,604
On the contrary we have confirmatory symptomatology.

502
01:09:01,244 --> 01:09:25,104
Who thought of Staph.? Only the computer! We communicate too well.

503
01:09:25,623 --> 01:09:35,862
But you see we reached at this conclusion after a thorough analysis of each remedy

504
01:09:36,104 --> 01:09:41,224
of each symptom to see which the weight of each symptom is.

505
01:09:43,024 --> 01:09:53,505
What would you have given her if she had come 10 years ago when she was married to the first husband

506
01:09:53,782 --> 01:09:59,144
and she would relate to you that story and then you would ask what about your father

507
01:09:59,414 --> 01:10:06,582
and she would relate a similar story with her father?

508
01:10:06,824 --> 01:10:15,542
You would immediately have thought of Staph. Most probably the Staph. elements are left.

509
01:10:15,784 --> 01:10:25,014
There are tendencies, she said I raise my voice wherever I can.

510
01:10:25,264 --> 01:10:28,854
Do you remember this answer?

511
01:10:30,412 --> 01:10:39,506
You overcame this answer, you bypass the right answers to put together the case

512
01:10:39,778 --> 01:10:53,184
and make it a real case. And in this case you can give Vario., Thuja, Lach., Kali-c. etc.

513
01:10:53,452 --> 01:11:00,104
and there is not going to be a real improvement on the case.

514
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:08,200
In which case we hope to be an improvement.

515
01:11:08,544 --> 01:11:15,988
What we are interested in is that we make a prescription based upon the facts

516
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:20,823
and we don’t twist the facts.

517
01:11:20,824 --> 01:11:31,340
We don’t project, we don’t put thing into the repertorization that do not exist.

518
01:11:33,744 --> 01:11:38,104
So you want to see again? Show me the Staph.

519
01:11:38,744 --> 01:11:42,904
Show them what Staph. is covering in this case.

520
01:11:43,424 --> 01:11:52,140
Sensitive to odors, speaks with soft voice, hair falling, soft stool,

521
01:11:52,384 --> 01:11:54,944
stiffness on the back on rising in the morning,

522
01:11:55,464 --> 01:12:09,024
waking from pain, herpetic eruption, jar stepping, right side, touch aggravates.

523
01:12:09,292 --> 01:12:20,544
That’s all. And ailments from grief.

524
01:12:31,052 --> 01:12:39,500
If you put ailments from mortification, if you put suppressed then it will come much stronger,

525
01:12:39,764 --> 01:12:41,824
but you don’t need that.

526
01:12:42,337 --> 01:12:47,274
You think, you have the idea from the repertorization, you see the Staph.

527
01:12:47,374 --> 01:12:52,303
 and you say maybe this is a Staph. case.

528
01:12:52,304 --> 01:13:04,864
How she behaves. And you don’t see the Lach. Because I was not happy with Lach.

529
01:13:05,105 --> 01:13:18,177
Is this a Lach. case? But Staph.? You say yes!

530
01:13:18,424 --> 01:13:34,544
So she needs a very high potency of Staph. 50M? She needs 50M.

531
01:13:48,624 --> 01:13:56,304
– I thought for a physical thing like this might be better to be lower because if it aggravates...?

532
01:13:56,824 --> 01:14:00,384
– No aggravation.

533
01:14:04,984 --> 01:14:17,974
Is Staph. her constitutional remedy?

534
01:14:18,944 --> 01:14:26,892
There is not such a thing but the basic remedy. This is a question mark.

535
01:14:28,424 --> 01:14:41,224
Most probably Staph. covers a layer that was created upon her basic pathology since childhood.

536
01:14:41,464 --> 01:14:48,610
Because of the treatment of her first husband, of her father maybe,

537
01:14:50,144 --> 01:14:57,306
a layer of Staph. remained on the top.

538
01:14:57,624 --> 01:15:03,332
And then this layer instead of being treated with Staph. it was treated

539
01:15:03,586 --> 01:15:11,179
with Ign., Nat-m., Sep. and it’s going.

540
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:25,504
And then you give Staph. and a certain symptomatology that will come up from the younger age,

541
01:15:25,772 --> 01:15:33,704
will pop up and will remain and then they will be the guiding symptoms for treating this case further.

542
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:43,484
Because in Homeopathy it’s very seldom, especially with the people of the West,

543
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:51,457
that you give one remedy and the person remains well for another 20 years.

544
01:15:51,948 --> 01:16:01,905
The people of the West we are too sick, we have several layers, especially because of vaccination,

545
01:16:02,146 --> 01:16:11,617
of antibiotics, because of the way of life, because of pollution, physical pollution in which we live,

546
01:16:11,864 --> 01:16:17,504
because of culture in which we suppress children,

547
01:16:17,817 --> 01:16:24,464
we suppress emotionally the children so much that we create problems with the children.

548
01:16:24,908 --> 01:16:34,657
Don’t cry, crying is forbidden. You know Germans never cry.

549
01:16:34,904 --> 01:16:40,268
English also, don’t laugh! And Norwegians!

550
01:16:40,544 --> 01:16:51,024
You go towards the south and children are crying and the mother doesn’t pay any attention,

551
01:16:51,297 --> 01:16:58,977
lets the child cry, she says what is the problem, she says maybe she is angry. Let her cry.

552
01:16:59,224 --> 01:17:11,264
That is why in the East in general, health is not damaged on these deep levels,

553
01:17:11,377 --> 01:17:16,264
mental / emotional so much, it is mostly physical symptomatology.

554
01:17:16,534 --> 01:17:27,544
So in India, in Pakistan, in South America, in Africa the pathology which we mostly see

555
01:17:27,820 --> 01:17:32,424
is not mental emotional, is mostly physical.

556
01:17:32,664 --> 01:17:39,064
The reason is pollution, culture, antibiotics, which they don’t have and vaccination.

557
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:46,508
All these countries did not have the type of treatment that we had in the West

558
01:17:46,747 --> 01:17:51,625
and we created the problems that we have today,

559
01:17:51,626 --> 01:17:57,772
concerning our emotions and our mentalities.

560
01:18:01,142 --> 01:18:10,864
The idea of what happened in the war, it was planned by some sick minds.

561
01:18:11,105 --> 01:18:15,222
There was a war, nobody knew why.

562
01:18:15,464 --> 01:18:22,064
Planned by sick minds that they could have easily stopped the whole thing,

563
01:18:22,305 --> 01:18:28,534
they could easily have arranged, but they preferred to have a war.

564
01:18:29,025 --> 01:18:43,624
The problem is that this is a society in which misinformation has become like the Goddess of today.

565
01:18:43,894 --> 01:18:48,225
Misinformation that means the media will present to the people whatever they like

566
01:18:48,505 --> 01:18:54,384
 and people will believe. Half of you believed that the war was justified.

567
01:18:55,094 --> 01:19:04,304
If not half, perhaps one third. If not one third, one quarter at least believe the war was justified.

568
01:19:04,545 --> 01:19:13,505
The war was not justified. They could have found a way... What did they do?

569
01:19:13,782 --> 01:19:21,974
They created 800.000 refugees, they created thousands of deaths

570
01:19:22,224 --> 01:19:30,664
and they create 200.000 refugees on the Serbian side that means 1.000.000 refugees

571
01:19:30,934 --> 01:19:38,344
with thousands killed in the name of humanity.

572
01:19:38,614 --> 01:19:46,224
Wait a moment! If you think how this mind was twisted

573
01:19:46,742 --> 01:19:52,865
and you try to find the depth of the sickness you will find in vaccinations,

574
01:19:53,384 --> 01:20:00,054
in antibiotics, in the way we live, in the pollution.

575
01:20:00,545 --> 01:20:10,544
Because if you get people that don’t have a natural life, emotional and mental life which is natural...

576
01:20:10,785 --> 01:20:16,182
How many women today cannot bear a child? Millions.

577
01:20:16,424 --> 01:20:19,745
In the West they cannot.

578
01:20:20,022 --> 01:20:25,384
And they have found artificial dissemination, artificial this and that...

579
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:28,464
Lie down for 9 months to bear a child etc.

580
01:20:28,982 --> 01:20:33,334
Even in Greece we have severe problem by this.

581
01:20:33,584 --> 01:20:39,222
How nature has now come back and kicks back.

582
01:20:39,734 --> 01:20:49,185
Because of sickness. It is sickness which breeds hatred.

583
01:20:49,462 --> 01:20:54,305
And all these people who play like marionettes with us,

584
01:20:54,704 --> 01:21:02,384
they play on the fact that we have hatred, that we hate each other.

585
01:21:02,625 --> 01:21:07,627
That’s all. Greeks hate Turks, Turks hate Greeks, Kosovars hate Serbians,

586
01:21:08,984 --> 01:21:16,704
 Pakistani hates Indians etc.

587
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:21,584
These people collect information and then they erupt the wars.

588
01:21:21,825 --> 01:21:32,854
But these minds which conceive this are in a deep state of sickness.

589
01:21:33,345 --> 01:21:40,022
That’s why when we treat people of the western world,

590
01:21:40,264 --> 01:21:47,105
we will need a series of remedies before we can bring them back to real health.

591
01:21:47,382 --> 01:21:53,014
And real health means I have feelings again!

592
01:21:53,264 --> 01:21:58,284
I haven’t killed my feelings. Most of us we have killed our feelings.

593
01:21:58,384 --> 01:22:00,744
It’s not allowed to do that, it’s not allowed to do this.

594
01:22:01,014 --> 01:22:08,064
And most of us we have reached that state of Alzheimer.

595
01:22:08,332 --> 01:22:13,452
You know Alzheimer? It’s an epidemic. I am losing my memory, of course.

596
01:22:13,944 --> 01:22:20,452
If you are bombarded by radio waves, TV waves, satellite waves...

597
01:22:23,372 --> 01:22:57,868
these walkies-talkies, mobile phones have these transmitters.

598
01:22:58,384 --> 01:23:07,104
This is a transmitter which transmits radio waves, electromagnetic waves.

599
01:23:07,344 --> 01:23:16,577
I put it here and the electromagnetic waves go through my brain and I boil my brain.

600
01:23:17,068 --> 01:23:27,628
And it’s a big discovery! This is the end!

601
01:23:30,977 --> 01:23:36,588
You see the antennas all over and how many microwaves go through our brains

602
01:23:36,864 --> 01:23:42,744
and then you find out I don’t have any more sexual desire,

603
01:23:42,988 --> 01:23:47,664
I am not interested, I don’t have a relationship any more.

604
01:23:47,937 --> 01:23:50,497
Why don’t you have a relationship?

605
01:23:50,744 --> 01:23:55,864
Because I have been hurt so many times and because you have been hurt so many, what happened?

606
01:23:56,108 --> 01:24:02,017
I’m out of this, forget it!

607
01:24:02,264 --> 01:24:15,064
Get Nat-m. or Ign. not so much Staph. because in Staph. the emotions are not killed.

608
01:24:15,308 --> 01:24:21,984
But get a Ph-ac. I am not interested. Get a Carb-v. I am not interested.

609
01:24:22,224 --> 01:24:28,266
I have no interest. Get Nat-m. the emotions are there

610
01:24:28,535 --> 01:24:32,624
 but they are so hurt that there is a kind of block.

611
01:24:32,865 --> 01:24:37,226
Get an Aur. She says I am so depressed,

612
01:24:37,495 --> 01:24:44,488
I don’t have time for anybody else, I just have to deal with myself.

613
01:24:46,544 --> 01:24:55,777
If an Aur. case has a responsible position in the making of the war what is he going to do?

614
01:24:56,268 --> 01:25:03,184
Inside him there is death. The idea of death is connected with Aur.

615
01:25:03,457 --> 01:25:12,417
Death is the best way out. That’s how they think!

616
01:25:12,664 --> 01:25:21,782
But these people are not only bank managers, they are managers of wars and think tanks.

617
01:25:23,062 --> 01:25:31,254
We pay you, you find the best way that Kosovars and Serbians will have war.

618
01:25:31,984 --> 01:25:35,584
Their minds work, they don’t know what they are doing.

619
01:25:35,825 --> 01:25:37,868
And they say this is the best way;

620
01:25:38,424 --> 01:25:42,096
you send an agent and tell this, and tells the other side that

621
01:25:42,586 --> 01:25:45,863
and then an eruption comes and they start fighting.

622
01:25:45,864 --> 01:25:48,424
And after that this is going to happen and then...

623
01:25:50,134 --> 01:25:55,745
You are a painter. You paint?

624
01:25:58,044 --> 01:26:04,105
I jumped from one subject to another like Lach.

625
01:26:04,177 --> 01:26:10,380
Now enough of this differential diagnosis.

626
01:26:10,892 --> 01:26:19,340
The main thing is to remember this is a layer which we try to take out to lift.

627
01:26:19,584 --> 01:26:27,264
Maybe she needs 2-3 repetitions of Staph. before this layer is lifted out

628
01:26:27,532 --> 01:26:35,704
and then the next layer will come where she may show some fears, anxieties more prominent.

629
01:26:35,980 --> 01:26:42,027
And then this will make her case much clearer

630
01:26:42,296 --> 01:26:48,938
and then you prescribe and then you will see the real difference.
