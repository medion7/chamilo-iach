1
00:00:18,205 --> 00:00:29,272
This is a lady 40 years old. You did not have any conception so far?

2
00:00:32,021 --> 00:00:36,549
Maybe you had an abortion when you were 20 or 21?
– Yes.

3
00:00:38,557 --> 00:00:44,317
– It was not spontaneous.
– I didn’t want the baby.

4
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:58,814
– Who was the gynecologist?
– He was in Denmark. I live in Greece the last 5 years, in Alonissos.

5
00:01:04,062 --> 00:01:11,709
But when I was 20 I took pills not to get pregnant after the abortion

6
00:01:14,517 --> 00:01:17,253
and then I stopped them when I was 28,

7
00:01:17,781 --> 00:01:22,749
I used spiral for 1 year but I didn’t like it,

8
00:01:23,277 --> 00:01:31,341
I could feel it so I took it out when I was 29 and I haven’t protected myself for 10 years.

9
00:01:32,821 --> 00:01:39,285
The first 4 years I didn’t have any special relationship so I was protecting myself a little

10
00:01:39,758 --> 00:01:47,741
but the last 6 years I am married to a Greek man here and we didn’t succeed to have any babies.

11
00:01:49,565 --> 00:01:54,197
– Was there any gynecologist who examined you?

12
00:01:54,694 --> 00:01:58,710
– Yes. After 2 years marriage I went to one in Denmark

13
00:01:59,141 --> 00:02:02,677
to check if my tubes were open and they were ok.

14
00:02:04,581 --> 00:02:06,925
– Did he see any endometriosis?

15
00:02:09,037 --> 00:02:15,732
- Not in Denmark but I went to a doctor in Volos in November

16
00:02:17,749 --> 00:02:24,613
and she said that if I wouldn’t stay pregnant after checking the eggs to develop,

17
00:02:25,589 --> 00:02:30,493
if nothing happens she said I should go and look because there was a small shade on the picture

18
00:02:31,222 --> 00:02:39,261
maybe there was piece of meat that prevents the eggs come down.

19
00:02:40,477 --> 00:02:57,509
But it was just an idea she had. My husband has been checked, he is ok.

20
00:03:00,677 --> 00:03:05,805
– He’s 100% ok?
– Yes.

21
00:03:07,918 --> 00:03:28,117
– I see. Do you have any complaints with your health?
– No. I have sinusitis.

22
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:39,373
– And do you have a lot of discharge from the nose?

23
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:45,022
– It irritates me in the throat, things coming down from behind.

24
00:03:46,245 --> 00:03:48,141
– Post-nasal discharge.

25
00:03:50,581 --> 00:03:55,405
What comes out is sticky?
– It’s sticky.

26
00:03:55,998 --> 00:03:57,534
– Very sticky?
– Yes.

27
00:03:58,981 --> 00:04:03,205
– In the morning especially do you have to hawk it?
– Yes.

28
00:04:08,517 --> 00:04:16,157
– Your husband notices that or he is annoyed by that?
– No.

29
00:04:23,245 --> 00:04:24,685
– It’s mostly in the morning?

30
00:04:25,277 --> 00:04:34,766
– No. One week I may have nothing and then suddenly for 2-3 days I’m irritated again.

31
00:04:35,469 --> 00:04:39,341
– But much bigger noise than now...
- Yes, to get it out.

32
00:04:44,781 --> 00:04:51,517
– Seldom the last year I have some dizziness.

33
00:04:54,781 --> 00:05:01,325
My own theory is that I had a much stressed life in Denmark before I came down here

34
00:05:02,325 --> 00:05:10,309
and maybe I was very tired without taking care of it and I had it maybe twice a year.

35
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:17,085
In the beginning it was more, I was very dizzy. Now I have it maybe once a year.

36
00:05:19,429 --> 00:05:22,749
– And when you have this what do you feel in your head?

37
00:05:23,621 --> 00:05:27,053
– I feel that the whole room goes around.

38
00:05:28,941 --> 00:05:35,277
– Vertigo. It’s not dizziness. Things outside are turning.

39
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:44,077
– For 24 hours I feel I am little sea-sick. I am walking a little strange.

40
00:05:45,862 --> 00:05:48,109
But now it’s more and more seldom.

41
00:05:50,437 --> 00:05:51,861
– Do you have anything else?

42
00:05:52,557 --> 00:05:54,933
Your menses are regular?
– Yes.

43
00:05:55,637 --> 00:06:02,457
– Every many days?
– It’s not 100% regular. Maybe 28 to 30 days.

44
00:06:04,522 --> 00:06:06,554
– The blood is normal?
– Yes.

45
00:06:08,178 --> 00:06:15,633
– How many days?
– 6-7 days. But a lot only for 1 day and a half.

46
00:06:16,633 --> 00:06:24,529
– And in the first days do you have clots of blood as well or do you have just blood?

47
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:27,617
– Seldom I have clots.

48
00:06:28,369 --> 00:06:31,177
– Otherwise it’s...
- Normal.

49
00:06:31,553 --> 00:06:35,041
– Dark blood or light blood?

50
00:06:35,778 --> 00:06:42,225
– It’s quite dark I think. Then it is brownish in the end.

51
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:54,658
– Before menses do you get upset easily, are you more prone to cry or to get angry?

52
00:06:55,698 --> 00:06:59,330
– Sometimes I noticed it, but not every time.

53
00:07:01,402 --> 00:07:07,137
– Otherwise your menses can come just like that without you understanding anything.

54
00:07:12,154 --> 00:07:19,067
– Yes. I’m not feeling something special now. I am not feeling tense.

55
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:25,882
Seldom it happens but it’s not every month.

56
00:07:28,594 --> 00:07:32,299
– Do you have any swelling of the breast before menses?

57
00:07:33,498 --> 00:07:35,991
– Sometimes I have a little in the one breast?

58
00:07:36,896 --> 00:07:37,944
– In the left?
– Yes.

59
00:07:38,296 --> 00:07:41,599
– Always the left?
– Yes actually.

60
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:48,111
– Do you have any headaches?
– No.

61
00:07:49,384 --> 00:07:52,528
– Do you have any stomach problems?

62
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:59,367
– I had before but not after my life became more quiet and easy.

63
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:09,111
It was a little complicated in Denmark.

64
00:08:10,183 --> 00:08:13,135
– Would you say it was wild?

65
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,855
– I would say emotionally I was with a man who was a drug addict with cocaine

66
00:08:20,287 --> 00:08:24,791
and things like that and made me ill.

67
00:08:30,264 --> 00:08:33,647
And because of those problems I have pain here in my stomach.

68
00:08:34,743 --> 00:08:38,903
–Did he hit you?
- Yes, in one case he hit me.

69
00:08:40,663 --> 00:08:46,343
– Not every day.
– No it was one time he got mad from the drugs.

70
00:08:48,568 --> 00:08:55,583
– At what age did you start having sex?
– 17 years old.

71
00:08:56,671 --> 00:09:07,400
– It was a good experience or it was rather negative?
– It was not the first thing...

72
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,791
- Nothing special.
– No.

73
00:09:10,567 --> 00:09:13,519
– Later on you had problems with your sexual life

74
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:16,191
 or you enjoyed it with no problem?
– No.

75
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:24,223
– Actually you had a quite a lot of enjoyment?
– Yes.

76
00:09:24,688 --> 00:09:36,992
– Did you ever get any infection?
– No. Only small like fungi. Not something serious.

77
00:09:37,855 --> 00:09:42,926
– Do you remember what type of medicine they gave you for that?

78
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:53,351
– No because it’s many years ago. It was in my early 20s I had some problems with that.

79
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:57,391
I had one pill that I didn’t like.

80
00:09:58,048 --> 00:10:05,431
I had to take 5 pills in one day and you get really terrible taste in the mouth and feeling strange.

81
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:07,479
– You took all 5 or 4?

82
00:10:08,031 --> 00:10:10,343
– I don’t remember but it was just a lot of pills.

83
00:10:13,807 --> 00:10:19,286
– Do you remember before the age of 20 that having any infection?

84
00:10:20,423 --> 00:10:25,103
– I didn’t have any infection but I had problem with my period in the beginning.

85
00:10:26,303 --> 00:10:30,383
I got it quite late, I was 16 and then it couldn’t really get started.

86
00:10:32,008 --> 00:10:38,959
I started to bleed and then it wouldn’t stop so I had a hormone pill to regulate it

87
00:10:39,575 --> 00:10:44,103
because I was bleeding for 1 month or so. Just a little every day. I wouldn’t stop.

88
00:10:44,671 --> 00:10:53,559
- When you took the pill did it help you or didn’t it make any change in your menses?

89
00:10:54,239 --> 00:10:59,175
– It made me bleed very much and then I was actually on holiday in Greece

90
00:10:59,647 --> 00:11:05,111
and I got frightened and I threw the pills out because I had really a lot of blood.

91
00:11:10,231 --> 00:11:15,903
– Did you ever have any epistaxis, nosebleeds? – No.

92
00:11:20,151 --> 00:11:42,095
– Is there any time when you feel worse or better?
– Yes. I feel best during the daytime.

93
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,575
I don’t like to work late. I don’t like to read in the evening.

94
00:11:51,655 --> 00:11:55,311
– When you wake up in the morning you feel refreshed from sleep?

95
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,551
– When I was younger I felt very fresh in the morning

96
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:09,183
but after the problems I had in Denmark with my boyfriend I have difficulty to wake up

97
00:12:09,567 --> 00:12:11,511
 but I still wake up early.

98
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:18,279
– What time?
– 6.30 a.m.

99
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:34,248
– Do you feel warm or cold?
– I feel cold very easily.

100
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:41,839
You see I am wearing this and people tell me you’re living in Greece,

101
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:46,191
you cannot wear things like that now but I am not feeling easily hot.

102
00:12:47,871 --> 00:12:49,919
– Do you swim in the sea?
– Yes.

103
00:12:50,247 --> 00:12:53,815
– You like it?
– Yes, I like it very much.

104
00:12:54,544 --> 00:12:56,887
– Swimming in the sea makes you feel good?
– Yes.

105
00:12:57,608 --> 00:13:05,184
– How much?
– I like to lie in the sea, relax in the sea.

106
00:13:05,615 --> 00:13:10,967
I like the feeling of relaxing, floating.

107
00:13:14,343 --> 00:13:18,647
– But would you say that you go to the sea and you’re tired and you have a bath

108
00:13:19,055 --> 00:13:23,991
and you come out of the sea lie down and feel full of energy?

109
00:13:24,527 --> 00:13:38,895
–No. I think I need to sleep after a bath. I feel sleepy, in a nice way of course.

110
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,399
–Do you sleep well?
– Yes.

111
00:13:44,704 --> 00:13:47,392
– Right through without waking?
– Yes.

112
00:13:48,407 --> 00:13:50,663
– Do you perspire during night?

113
00:13:55,583 --> 00:14:00,447
– I actually wake up and I’m often thirsty at night, I always have a glass of water,

114
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,136
I don’t know if it’s because I’m sweating.

115
00:14:03,936 --> 00:14:08,351
I am not feeling wet on my body but I feel thirsty. I drink every night.

116
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:13,863
– That means you wake up and drink water. Many times?

117
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:19,255
– No. One time and I’m not annoyed of it. I fall asleep at once again.

118
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,856
– Your nails are strong or brittle?

119
00:14:28,183 --> 00:14:31,591
– I have one with problem, the others are strong.

120
00:14:32,927 --> 00:14:40,078
– Your toes they enter the flesh and you have to cut the specially?

121
00:14:41,095 --> 00:14:45,519
– A little. My big toes but not the other ones.

122
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:53,295
– Are you constipated at all? You don’t have regular stool, difficult stool?

123
00:15:00,335 --> 00:15:07,263
Every day you go to the toilet to have evacuation of your bowel?

124
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:10,279
– Yes, every day in the morning.

125
00:15:10,823 --> 00:15:26,159
– No problem, no difficulty?
– No. It’s a little watery actually. Not much but a little.

126
00:15:26,767 --> 00:15:28,383
– Do you have stool every morning?

127
00:15:29,104 --> 00:15:33,255
– Every morning, seldom in the afternoon.

128
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:39,135
– What is the worst time for you? Is it in the evening when you are tired

129
00:15:39,631 --> 00:15:50,631
or in the night or in the morning when you wake up? When you feel tired and you don’t feel well.

130
00:15:54,407 --> 00:16:04,440
– If I feel like that it’s in the evening but actually one thing that irritates me

131
00:16:05,712 --> 00:16:15,656
it’s I am feeling often very tired without reason I feel, kind of exhausted.

132
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,999
– When is that? Do you notice if it is a time?

133
00:16:20,863 --> 00:16:26,894
– Usually in the midday. I need to take a nap for 20 mins and then I feel ok again.

134
00:16:30,063 --> 00:16:32,895
– At about what time?

135
00:16:34,695 --> 00:16:46,407
– 2-3 p.m. Some people don’t need a nap but I need to relax for 20 mins in the afternoon.

136
00:16:47,255 --> 00:16:50,351
– And you need to sleep or only lie down?

137
00:16:52,655 --> 00:16:58,415
– I fall asleep very quickly so I sleep for 20 mins.

138
00:17:04,303 --> 00:17:13,416
– How much salt do you take?
– Not too much.

139
00:17:14,592 --> 00:17:20,799
– What about sweets?
– I like sweets but I am not eating them very much.

140
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:29,551
– There is any food which you really do not like? You would never eat this food.

141
00:17:35,439 --> 00:17:37,903
– I don’t like kidney and things like that.

142
00:17:49,104 --> 00:17:54,935
I like liver but I don’t like the other things from inside.

143
00:17:57,255 --> 00:18:01,999
– What else?
– I don’t like to drink orange juice, I get pain my stomach.

144
00:18:05,111 --> 00:18:10,598
And I don’t like to drink it, to have it in my mouth.

145
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:19,439
– Even fresh orange juice?
– I can drink fresh orange juice if the oranges are sweet.

146
00:18:25,224 --> 00:18:27,288
– Do you keep a position in sleep?

147
00:18:28,064 --> 00:18:32,551
Do you sleep only on the left/ right side or you can sleep in any position?

148
00:18:34,183 --> 00:18:37,407
– I have only a little problem to sleep in my stomach now.

149
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:42,799
I have pain my back if I’m on my stomach.

150
00:18:45,695 --> 00:18:54,391
– Would you say your sexual desire is normal or much more than normal or less than normal?

151
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:57,335
– I’d say it’s quite normal.

152
00:19:05,623 --> 00:19:09,055
– Do you have any fears? Are you afraid of anything?

153
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:16,407
– No. Not something special but I had some crisis of fear in my life.

154
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:28,735
– What kind of fear?
– I don’t know how to explain it.

155
00:19:29,311 --> 00:19:33,391
It’s like when you suddenly feel afraid of losing yourself.

156
00:19:35,328 --> 00:19:44,241
I had when I was 13 and when I was 24 and then again 2-3 years ago.

157
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,151
And I have worked to find out for what reason I get it

158
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:56,878
and I think I have found out somehow why I have this sudden attack of fear.

159
00:19:57,927 --> 00:20:01,231
– Why? Can you say why?

160
00:20:01,927 --> 00:20:04,500
– I think it has to do with things when I was 2 years old

161
00:20:04,763 --> 00:20:10,251
when I was in the hospital taken away from my parents and they were not allowed to see me

162
00:20:11,722 --> 00:20:13,994
and I think I developed it there.

163
00:20:14,635 --> 00:20:18,171
I was very helpless with those doctors doing whatever they wanted to me

164
00:20:20,067 --> 00:20:27,204
and I think from that period of my life I get this feeling of fear.

165
00:20:29,308 --> 00:20:32,859
– Do you have any fear for doctors now?

166
00:20:33,867 --> 00:20:41,195
– No. I have fears if people want to decide things for me and lock into a room or something.

167
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:51,542
–Are you afraid of closed places?
– Yes.

168
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:57,086
– Would you enter a lift?

169
00:20:57,495 --> 00:21:06,174
– Yes, I do that I think it is more like I am afraid somebody to lock me into a room so I can’t get out.

170
00:21:08,174 --> 00:21:10,686
– Were you ever locked by your boyfriend?

171
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:18,654
 Did your boyfriend lock you any time?
–No.

172
00:21:19,247 --> 00:21:23,414
– Anybody else locked you?
– I don’t remember.

173
00:21:32,695 --> 00:21:34,527
– Fear of high places?

174
00:21:36,567 --> 00:21:40,631
– The last year I had a little problem with the high places but sometimes I don’t have it,

175
00:21:41,222 --> 00:21:45,830
sometimes I get very dizzy.

176
00:21:55,511 --> 00:22:01,382
– Do you tolerate the sun? You go out in the beach, are you lying in the sun?

177
00:22:02,758 --> 00:22:06,326
– Only if it not too hot. If it is too hot I go in a shade.

178
00:22:07,358 --> 00:22:12,006
I enjoy the sun but if it is too hot no.

179
00:22:13,263 --> 00:22:19,414
– But will you have any problems with the sun? Headaches and things like that?

180
00:22:20,894 --> 00:22:25,854
– No. It can irritate in my eyes if I am not wearing glasses.

181
00:22:35,118 --> 00:22:48,735
– How much water do you drink?
– In the summer I drink 3-4 lit.

182
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:52,238
– Cold water?
– I don’t drink cold water.

183
00:22:58,615 --> 00:23:03,615
– When you drink you drink a whole glass or sips?
– I drink a whole glass.

184
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:13,638
– Were you having any problems with your ears as a child?

185
00:23:14,934 --> 00:23:20,022
– No. Like inflammations? No.

186
00:23:24,983 --> 00:23:29,150
The problem I had when I was a child was having very high metabolism

187
00:23:30,782 --> 00:23:33,518
so that’s why I went to the hospital when I was a child.

188
00:23:33,942 --> 00:23:37,182
I fainted in the morning I had very low blood sugar.

189
00:23:40,983 --> 00:23:44,742
– And what did they give you? Thyroid hormone?

190
00:23:45,334 --> 00:23:46,694
– I don’t think they gave me anything.

191
00:23:47,422 --> 00:23:50,262
They just said I had to eat before I went to sleep in the evening.

192
00:23:50,974 --> 00:23:53,886
My parents had to give me something to eat before I go to school.

193
00:23:54,783 --> 00:23:56,999
– How is your appetite now?
– It’s very good!

194
00:23:58,999 --> 00:24:02,774
– As much you can eat there is no problem, you don’t put on weight?

195
00:24:03,838 --> 00:24:08,974
– I have to take a little care now. Before I could eat whatever I wanted.

196
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:20,615
But I eat 3 times a day. But I still have it like if I am not eating I get kind of exhausted.

197
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:31,558
– Is this exhaustion that you mentioned before a sudden exhaustion because you have not eaten?

198
00:24:32,135 --> 00:24:35,175
– No.

199
00:24:35,622 --> 00:24:47,503
– Do you have any leucorrhea? This discharge from the vagina.
– No. I had it when I was younger.

200
00:24:49,095 --> 00:25:02,855
– You took some medication to stop it?
– Only when it caused itching as well.

201
00:25:10,854 --> 00:25:15,062
– Then you took something to stop the itching.

202
00:25:15,782 --> 00:25:18,918
– Yes because together with the itching it was some fluid coming out.

203
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:28,606
– And then you were given a medicine that stopped the itching and the fluid.

204
00:25:28,926 --> 00:25:31,270
– I think it’s some pills.

205
00:25:45,478 --> 00:25:48,390
– Do you drink milk?
– No.

206
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,430
– Are you affected by drafts?

207
00:25:51,774 --> 00:25:54,534
If you sit somewhere where there is a draft are affected by it?

208
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:14,799
– Yes it will affect my muscles if I am working and sometimes if I sit like that

209
00:26:15,215 --> 00:26:19,647
there is pain in my face from the nerves from the draft.

210
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:33,478
– When you sleep in the night now, with this weather, do you cover yourself with one blanket or two?

211
00:26:34,687 --> 00:26:39,318
– One but not very thin. Normal blanket.

212
00:26:44,223 --> 00:26:47,478
– Are you afraid of dogs, cats?
– No.

213
00:26:48,383 --> 00:26:55,335
– Thunderstorms?
– No. I don’t like heavy wind. That makes me nervous.

214
00:26:59,654 --> 00:27:02,862
– What are you afraid of? The house will collapse?

215
00:27:04,278 --> 00:27:10,342
– I don’t like the noise, the atmosphere it creates.

216
00:27:18,666 --> 00:27:21,993
– Do you remember having warts in your fingers?

217
00:27:31,689 --> 00:27:36,809
– I had when I was a kid on the foot and on the hand I think.

218
00:27:37,178 --> 00:27:41,745
– Do you know how they went away?
– I think they were burned.

219
00:27:50,313 --> 00:27:52,441
– By a doctor?
– Yes.

220
00:27:58,409 --> 00:28:01,673
– Would you say that you are open in your emotions,

221
00:28:02,161 --> 00:28:09,049
you can express your emotions, your feelings or you are reserved and careful.

222
00:28:12,426 --> 00:28:14,835
– I think I am quite good in expressing.

223
00:28:23,057 --> 00:28:28,417
I get easily angry and get it out and I can tell if I have something that bothers me.

224
00:28:33,201 --> 00:28:38,361
In that case I think maybe I am trying to be stronger than I am

225
00:28:38,753 --> 00:28:44,329
if something bad is happening around me I continue to work and do everything normally

226
00:28:46,594 --> 00:28:52,305
and maybe suddenly I get very tired instead of saying I’m not able to continue

227
00:28:52,801 --> 00:29:00,602
 because I’m in a bad situation. I think I am too proud to do that, I try to keep up.

228
00:29:04,874 --> 00:29:07,705
– We’ll see if we can do something.

229
00:29:15,297 --> 00:29:23,517
What happened with this case? Why the first question I put is did you have an abortion?

230
00:29:24,653 --> 00:29:30,933
– Yes. Was it voluntary? Yes. I did not want the child.

231
00:29:31,558 --> 00:29:40,101
– You know why? Because I saw a healthy woman rather healthy cannot have a child.

232
00:29:41,453 --> 00:29:44,709
For me I have seen this phenomenon again and again

233
00:29:45,749 --> 00:29:57,309
after voluntary abortion when there are some adhesions after excision of the uterus.

234
00:29:58,109 --> 00:30:05,037
You know the gynecologist they go and scrap the uterus to get out the fetus

235
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:13,997
and by scrapping and making a deeper scratch they make adhesions

236
00:30:15,797 --> 00:30:26,853
and these adhesions they do not allow the fetus to develop anymore, find a place to develop.

237
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:38,566
It is one of the worst cases that we can have because I have seen in spite of battling with such cases,

238
00:30:40,341 --> 00:30:47,493
I have not been able treat cases of that type.

239
00:30:48,349 --> 00:30:52,517
When the damage is traumatic for the uterus after abortion.

240
00:30:53,845 --> 00:31:02,964
She is not able to have children because the endometrium has been spoiled

241
00:31:03,581 --> 00:31:09,285
and has been growing adhesions and that’s why she cannot have a child.

242
00:31:10,181 --> 00:31:16,949
Otherwise her hormonal system is working alright, the fallopian tubes are open,

243
00:31:18,174 --> 00:31:26,301
the ovaries are discharging but no conception.

244
00:31:29,205 --> 00:31:33,357
That’s a case where we have to treat this kind of disease

245
00:31:33,974 --> 00:31:41,045
and as you saw me I had a big problem in coming down to a remedy.

246
00:31:43,605 --> 00:31:48,109
Very difficult because I did not have enough information.

247
00:31:50,094 --> 00:32:00,638
In the beginning I asked her also how she cleans her sinuses.

248
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:13,101
Because usually Med., they raise postnasal discharge which is sticky

249
00:32:13,885 --> 00:32:25,694
especially in the morning has to be cleared and is so sticky and annoying that the person has to...

250
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:39,045
I had a woman quite respectable and I asked the children how they feel,

251
00:32:39,621 --> 00:32:46,412
it’s terrible, it’s nauseating to hear mother doing...

252
00:32:47,167 --> 00:32:59,254
Because one child came with the idea of Med. and I said your father died of heart attack?

253
00:32:59,974 --> 00:33:08,741
Yes. What age? About 52. Your mother is doing that? Yes!

254
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:15,590
And it’s so terrible! That means the husband had gonorrhea,

255
00:33:16,358 --> 00:33:21,045
the woman was affected by gonorrhea of the husband,

256
00:33:21,997 --> 00:33:29,485
she develops this postnasal discharge which is characteristic of Med. and the child now got Med.

257
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:38,516
But then Med. was not confirmed you saw

258
00:33:39,373 --> 00:33:50,614
when I asked her the time where she would be better should be what? Afternoon, evening time.

259
00:33:52,478 --> 00:33:56,117
She should have said in the evening I become alive.

260
00:33:57,397 --> 00:34:03,318
The second thing she should have said is that I come here actually in Alonissos

261
00:34:03,805 --> 00:34:11,237
and live here because of the sea because I feel so wonderful when I’m in the sea.

262
00:34:12,542 --> 00:34:16,669
I could not get this information either.

263
00:34:19,021 --> 00:34:25,365
There was a third keynote about oranges; it’s the food of Med.

264
00:34:26,845 --> 00:34:34,981
If you ask them how many oranges they can take they say unlimited,

265
00:34:35,677 --> 00:34:39,469
more than 10. 10,20 oranges.

266
00:34:46,774 --> 00:34:51,605
She said oranges make me upset. Forget Med.

267
00:34:53,037 --> 00:35:01,557
There was a possibility of Sil. I did not see any strong keynotes of it.

268
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:04,158
She did not have the constipation,

269
00:35:04,598 --> 00:35:12,126
the nails... soft nails... the draft was not a big thing with her.

270
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:25,788
And then Calc. There is no perspiration, no desire for sweets.

271
00:35:26,829 --> 00:35:41,325
Nat-m. she did not feel this type of Nat-m. been having a lot of grief and being closed.

272
00:35:41,893 --> 00:35:51,238
She was not that closed. And she despair me and I did not what to do.

273
00:35:51,669 --> 00:35:55,341
You had me not speaking for quite some time.

274
00:35:57,582 --> 00:36:04,789
I don’t do it usually but I had to do some hard thinking and searching.

275
00:36:06,381 --> 00:36:11,349
I was looking some things which are of no interest to you at this moment.

276
00:36:15,742 --> 00:36:26,406
No reaction... The late reaction is no reaction.

277
00:36:28,453 --> 00:36:37,877
And finally what I had is... there were no fears actually,

278
00:36:41,429 --> 00:36:48,581
the bleeding was not Phosphorus bleeding, was neither a big disturbance there.

279
00:36:50,533 --> 00:36:57,093
She claims that her sexual energy is quite normal.

280
00:37:02,077 --> 00:37:09,972
Hormonally I could not see any problem. Everything was functioning.

281
00:37:10,925 --> 00:37:17,533
The only thing I could confirm from the very beginning was adhesions in the endometrium

282
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:30,053
until I asked her and she said yes it was somewhat confirmed by a gynecologist.

283
00:37:33,413 --> 00:37:42,886
Therefore I had to give a remedy.

284
00:37:53,163 --> 00:38:31,611
I thought of Hyos. Nat-m., Calc., Thuja, Acon., Sil., Staph., Nit-ac... Calc-i.

285
00:38:31,755 --> 00:38:37,787
Show me the symptoms that you have used.

286
00:38:38,842 --> 00:38:41,242
The symptoms are;

287
00:38:41,818 --> 00:38:45,874
fear of narrow places, fear of wind, vertigo high places,

288
00:38:46,538 --> 00:38:53,794
vertigo as everything is turning, catarrh postnasal, posterior nares, mucus in the throat,

289
00:38:55,915 --> 00:39:01,546
thirst for large quantity, thirst in the night...Thirst in the night is very interesting

290
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:05,970
because if you look at the repertory you will see Sil. quite strongly.

291
00:39:07,227 --> 00:39:18,035
Stool watery, leucorrhea itching, menses dark, sterility,

292
00:39:20,754 --> 00:39:32,475
menses swelling of mammae before menses, warts suppressed, general in the evening worse,

293
00:39:33,451 --> 00:39:36,506
inflammation of sinuses, weakness afternoon.

294
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:46,346
This is somewhat a repertorization that you may be using

295
00:39:46,683 --> 00:40:00,535
and then it says that the best remedy is Nat-m. and you say Nat-m... I don’t like.

296
00:40:01,335 --> 00:40:12,703
The second is Calc. She feels cold but apart from that there is no other... and then comes Thuja.

297
00:40:18,575 --> 00:40:28,111
Explain why Thuja. Because of fear of wind, it’s very interesting,

298
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:37,430
I have added this for Thuja myself. Postnasal catarrh, has thirst in the night,

299
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:48,359
watery stool, suppressed warts, of course. Evening weakness and what is more;

300
00:40:49,895 --> 00:40:55,631
adhesions... you never put it.

301
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:21,890
Anyhow you know that the tendency of Thuja to produce adhesions, warts, growths.

302
00:41:23,946 --> 00:41:27,026
Her gynecologist said that there is a growth that impedes.

303
00:41:27,338 --> 00:41:29,258
I don’t believe this is the real problem.

304
00:41:29,642 --> 00:41:37,649
The real problem is that the endometrium has been spoiled extensively.

305
00:41:38,722 --> 00:41:43,418
This is the real reason for her having this sterility.

306
00:41:44,218 --> 00:41:48,074
And it is going to be very difficult to correct that

307
00:41:48,738 --> 00:41:53,593
but the remedy with which we must start at this moment is Thuja.

308
00:41:56,962 --> 00:42:01,658
When I said Hyos. nobody objected.

309
00:42:06,362 --> 00:42:12,945
You should shout! I play tricks.

310
00:42:18,162 --> 00:42:23,696
When I was teaching in the beginning I was teaching the Greeks here back in 1970.

311
00:42:24,993 --> 00:42:28,945
They would bring paper cases put them on the wall,

312
00:42:30,833 --> 00:42:43,066
they wrote and I said you take this and this and that symptom and because of this the remedy is Calc.

313
00:42:45,673 --> 00:42:49,257
Do you agree? This is wrong.

314
00:42:51,313 --> 00:42:55,665
I take this and that symptom and the remedy is Sulph.

315
00:42:56,105 --> 00:43:01,232
Do you agree? No, this is wrong.

316
00:43:02,481 --> 00:43:08,921
I take this combination... it’s Carb-v. Now we understand.

317
00:43:09,721 --> 00:43:12,217
Do you agree? Wrong!

318
00:43:13,585 --> 00:43:17,592
I take this and that and the remedy is Thuja.

319
00:43:18,152 --> 00:43:22,040
Nobody dares to say this is the right remedy.

320
00:43:24,617 --> 00:43:30,001
That means in cases where we have complications

321
00:43:30,713 --> 00:43:35,584
we have to choose the right combination of symptoms

322
00:43:35,944 --> 00:43:38,336
and choose them in a realistic basis.

323
00:43:40,657 --> 00:43:44,065
Sometimes you are based on the pathology quite a lot.

324
00:43:45,929 --> 00:43:54,192
You don’t have in all cases general symptoms or mental emotional symptoms.

325
00:43:57,793 --> 00:44:00,121
But here with Thuja it’s interesting.

326
00:44:00,705 --> 00:44:03,625
She says I fear wind. That’s interesting.

327
00:44:05,449 --> 00:44:08,712
I was thinking of Thuja and she said I fear wind.

328
00:44:13,778 --> 00:44:27,858
Because Cham. known for it but Thuja is not. Bye bye!

329
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:36,953
So the remedy is Thuja. What is the potency?

330
00:44:42,168 --> 00:44:59,073
Who would suggest 6X? 12C repeatedly?

331
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:33,993
1. 30C? 4. 200C? 19. 1M? 4. 10M? 7. 50M? 1. CM?

332
00:45:41,569 --> 00:45:47,641
The woman is healthy is general? No problem.

333
00:45:48,161 --> 00:45:53,729
You can go as high as you like in this case. It’s no problem.

334
00:45:54,536 --> 00:46:02,537
You can try, if you want, a very high potency 50M or CM with her to see whether she will react.

335
00:46:04,041 --> 00:46:12,128
If she reacts in a very high potency there is a possibility bringing out the warts again

336
00:46:12,536 --> 00:46:16,680
and reducing the adhesions. Maybe there is a possibility.

337
00:46:18,057 --> 00:46:22,449
If she does not react in this case I would still insist.

338
00:46:23,081 --> 00:46:31,001
I would first give 50M. Then I would wait for 2 months to see whether there is any reaction.

339
00:46:31,657 --> 00:46:40,266
If there is no reaction I will go to low potency like 6X or 12X and give three times a day

340
00:46:40,873 --> 00:46:47,657
repeatedly before I give up on Thuja

341
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:54,289
but if I give up on Thuja I don’t know what to do next, to tell you the truth.

342
00:46:56,802 --> 00:47:02,329
I don’t see the underlying [remedy].

343
00:47:02,585 --> 00:47:04,433
Maybe Med. is true.

344
00:47:04,865 --> 00:47:11,689
Maybe it will change after Thuja as complementary she may need Med. I am not sure.

345
00:47:12,962 --> 00:47:17,594
Calc.? I don’t see it.

346
00:47:18,722 --> 00:47:21,009
She eats whatever she likes without putting on weight.

347
00:47:22,618 --> 00:47:24,785
Sweets; she said she is not interested.

348
00:47:25,721 --> 00:47:27,777
Sweat; there is no sweat.

349
00:47:28,233 --> 00:47:36,352
Where can you base a prescription of Calc.? Sil. of the thirst in the night... maybe Sil.

350
00:47:36,762 --> 00:47:40,569
but where are the other symptoms except of soft nails.

351
00:47:41,313 --> 00:47:45,210
You don’t have enough information.

352
00:47:47,842 --> 00:47:55,073
– How about Med.?
– I rejected Med. As a second [remedy]?

353
00:47:56,169 --> 00:47:59,809
May be a shot in the dark.

354
00:48:00,897 --> 00:48:09,818
You don’t have the real symptoms, the keynotes of the remedy on which you can base your prescription.

355
00:48:13,305 --> 00:48:20,561
But I believe there is another remedy which I don’t want to confuse you but anyhow...

356
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:38,218
- What about organ-specific remedies? Fraxinus. Dr. Benett wrote a little book about fertility.

357
00:48:41,739 --> 00:48:50,634
– I don’t know. What is this?
– Fraxinus americanus.

358
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:05,346
– Is a herb?
– A tree.

359
00:49:07,313 --> 00:49:09,578
– I don’t know this remedy.

360
00:49:19,194 --> 00:49:27,177
– I did think it was Thuja, but I would worry about giving a high potency.

361
00:49:28,769 --> 00:49:31,489
Because of all the suppression that she had in the past.

362
00:49:39,674 --> 00:49:46,025
– If both come back discharge and the warts she will be cured.

363
00:49:47,889 --> 00:49:53,113
This is what we expect; that the discharge will come back and the warts will come back.

364
00:49:53,802 --> 00:49:57,825
If that happens we’ll have a baby.

365
00:49:58,698 --> 00:50:06,513
– But if you give the potency very high that will make a strong reaction that would be uncomfortable.

366
00:50:07,146 --> 00:50:11,738
– No. There is not real deep pathology.

367
00:50:12,314 --> 00:50:22,282
What happens is a trauma on the endometrium which is superficial.

368
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:31,625
If she has endometriosis it would be different because in endometriosis we have a disease,

369
00:50:32,034 --> 00:50:34,689
a quite serious condition.
