1
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:29,028
This is a gentleman from Denmark who suffers of something very peculiar and unusual.

2
00:00:30,067 --> 00:00:40,548
He has been treated by several homeopaths and himself and the remedies you have taken so far are...

3
00:00:42,118 --> 00:01:15,938
- Nat-m., Nat-c., Kali-ph., Calc., Lyc., Sil., Nux-v., Phos., Spig., Tub., Arn. and Hyper.

4
00:01:16,184 --> 00:01:19,267
– Your problem is...

5
00:01:19,506 --> 00:01:27,958
- That the left side of my face registers electromagnetic fields from ordinary devices

6
00:01:28,058 --> 00:01:36,228
like lights, computers, radios, all electric motors...

7
00:01:36,503 --> 00:01:45,101
I get burning pains around the eye in different places.

8
00:01:45,344 --> 00:01:54,586
That’s how it starts. For example if we turn on a fan here will start a burning pain.

9
00:01:55,104 --> 00:02:02,784
If I sit in front of that computer after 5 minutes I get this burning pain here.

10
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:09,904
And then it gets more and more intense as if somebody is holding a cigarette.

11
00:02:10,145 --> 00:02:11,946
– So much?
– Yes.

12
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:19,105
And if I sit long enough as if someone is pulling the cigarette out right here.

13
00:02:19,385 --> 00:02:23,545
Before that happens I move.

14
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,380
If I can’t move then I have a problem,

15
00:02:26,628 --> 00:02:33,295
like in a long distance airplane when they have many TV screens above the head.

16
00:02:33,346 --> 00:02:43,705
Then I get extremely restless.

17
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:50,380
After a while the brain shuts down I get into a coma.

18
00:02:51,908 --> 00:02:58,575
If you ask me a question I can hear it but I can’t answer you.

19
00:03:04,975 --> 00:03:13,420
This happens when I am near any device.

20
00:03:17,426 --> 00:03:22,895
And it started from working with computers.

21
00:03:23,146 --> 00:03:27,225
I was assistant’s analyst for 8 years

22
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:33,900
and before that I had a translation firm for a couple of years

23
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:39,020
and I worked in the translation with a computer.

24
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:47,366
That was 1983. Before 1983, no computers. Good health.

25
00:03:47,466 --> 00:03:53,615
– No problems?
– Except for a migraine every 3 months.

26
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:58,368
Would come out of the blue.

27
00:03:58,468 --> 00:04:05,625
– Your job had to do with coming in contact with electrical devices?

28
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,825
– All day in front of the screen.

29
00:04:08,925 --> 00:04:12,505
– You mean you started in 1983 with the computers.

30
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:15,863
– Yes, then there was no problem.

31
00:04:16,104 --> 00:04:19,187
– And the problem appeared how many years later?

32
00:04:19,428 --> 00:04:25,064
– In 1983... it appeared 2 years later

33
00:04:25,338 --> 00:04:29,178
because I was working there for a translation firm

34
00:04:29,427 --> 00:04:34,298
and the PC screens at that time were more magnetic.

35
00:04:34,924 --> 00:04:41,824
And then I translated books and I got my own little PC which was extremely magnetic.

36
00:04:42,068 --> 00:04:48,986
I’ve measure it.
– You have such a device? You made your own device?

37
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:53,860
– No, I bought one. Many people have this problem.

38
00:04:54,106 --> 00:04:59,744
– You can give me the address, I want to buy to check the devices here.

39
00:04:59,988 --> 00:05:02,720
– I have one at home. I can bring it tomorrow.

40
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:09,984
– I can pay you for this, you can leave it here and buy a new one.

41
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:19,188
– It started where I worked very hard for a book.

42
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,266
I worked very hard anyway.

43
00:05:25,244 --> 00:05:34,050
Then I moved to Denmark where I thought I would get this job

44
00:05:34,304 --> 00:05:39,810
because I have been working as an engineer at the oil business before.

45
00:05:40,064 --> 00:05:41,860
But I didn’t get it.

46
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,484
– Do you usually have this problem with the throat?

47
00:05:43,584 --> 00:06:00,225
- This has been for a long time. Mucus in the throat all the time since probably 15 years ago.

48
00:06:00,505 --> 00:06:10,572
– After 1985... It’s not coincidental with the sensitivity.

49
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:16,606
- No! The sensitivity came from one day to the next.

50
00:06:16,706 --> 00:06:19,753
The total breakthrough. But there was a build-up.

51
00:06:19,853 --> 00:06:22,458
Came from one day to the next in my job...

52
00:06:22,707 --> 00:06:27,563
- What year?
– November 1993.

53
00:06:31,748 --> 00:06:41,365
In 1985 I started to notice maybe a headache, feeling lack of energy.

54
00:06:41,465 --> 00:06:47,865
– But 1985 at the same time coincides with your throat starting to collect mucus.

55
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,705
– I don’t think so because I was smoking.

56
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:56,985
Then I quit smoking in 1987.

57
00:06:57,747 --> 00:07:03,908
And I think after that it was more pronounced.

58
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:12,868
In 1993 it was when this allergy started.

59
00:07:13,107 --> 00:07:14,805
Which means I cannot work anywhere

60
00:07:14,905 --> 00:07:19,946
because I can’t be in an office and I cannot do manual work

61
00:07:20,185 --> 00:07:25,066
because then they use motors and if I deliver newspapers

62
00:07:25,305 --> 00:07:29,045
there are the neon lights of the streets.

63
00:07:29,145 --> 00:07:33,304
– The can affect you?
– Yes. I get sick.

64
00:07:35,348 --> 00:07:40,214
– In 1993 it started from one day to the next my face was burning

65
00:07:40,709 --> 00:07:45,327
I went on the bars and there was like people sticking cigarettes in my head

66
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:48,065
from the neon lights on the bars.

67
00:07:48,304 --> 00:07:51,651
Get dizzy, then I got to the train, the same.

68
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:56,407
For several months I could only be for 2 minutes in the supermarket

69
00:07:56,507 --> 00:07:58,138
because of the neon lights.

70
00:07:58,387 --> 00:08:02,743
Then it would burn and I would have to run home.

71
00:08:03,748 --> 00:08:07,098
That’s the condition since 1993.

72
00:08:08,627 --> 00:08:12,983
Then I’ve been very limited in what I can do.

73
00:08:13,588 --> 00:08:17,045
So many square meters I can be at home because of it.

74
00:08:17,145 --> 00:08:25,348
– Have you been near a converter?
– No.

75
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,455
– Have you checked this?
– Yes.

76
00:08:29,706 --> 00:08:33,028
- Whether it is really bad?
– No.

77
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:39,946
– You have not checked?
– I have not been. I have checked, yes.

78
00:08:41,226 --> 00:08:47,375
– And it’s very bad?
– Yes.

79
00:08:47,626 --> 00:08:51,466
It’s quite bad but it has started with the PCs definitely.

80
00:08:51,705 --> 00:09:01,706
No transform stations, no high wires. Nothing like that.

81
00:09:01,945 --> 00:09:05,546
– But I noticed 2 years after working every day

82
00:09:05,785 --> 00:09:10,415
that I would start getting a little bit headache and feeling unwell.

83
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:16,548
So I changed from that kind of screen to a plasma/LCD screen.

84
00:09:16,815 --> 00:09:19,589
That was better for some years.

85
00:09:19,864 --> 00:09:24,984
Then in this system analyst job I got the plasma screen

86
00:09:25,225 --> 00:09:30,104
because there are many electrical fields so I removed the magnetic fields

87
00:09:30,345 --> 00:09:34,454
because already in 1985 I was sensitive.

88
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:39,305
Then with the electric fields I worked for 5 years then... boom.

89
00:09:39,574 --> 00:09:42,134
– Then the big change started.

90
00:09:42,388 --> 00:09:50,068
– Then I gradually got a red face and from the one day to the next

91
00:09:50,584 --> 00:09:57,387
 there was a quantum jump in the health to sensitivity.

92
00:09:57,626 --> 00:10:00,976
Way up to anything electrical.

93
00:10:01,227 --> 00:10:04,301
Even the pocket calculator will burn.

94
00:10:04,767 --> 00:10:11,467
– Mostly is burning, no other symptoms?
– No. It starts burning.

95
00:10:11,806 --> 00:10:15,207
– And then eventually effects the mind.

96
00:10:15,307 --> 00:10:23,226
– And then I get extremely restless and lose concentration.

97
00:10:23,501 --> 00:10:28,864
Then I have to get out of there otherwise it gets very painful.

98
00:10:29,136 --> 00:10:32,186
– And it can lead you up to almost coma?

99
00:10:32,461 --> 00:10:36,816
– Yes. It can put me in coma because the last 2,5 I had to study anatomy.

100
00:10:37,067 --> 00:10:42,426
And there the first year it was with neon lights and it was very painful.

101
00:10:42,701 --> 00:10:49,101
Then I got to come to home and there we had an overhead projector with a fan

102
00:10:49,344 --> 00:10:51,904
and the fan became very painful.

103
00:10:53,707 --> 00:10:59,066
Then I bought another overhead projector without a fan

104
00:10:59,341 --> 00:11:02,906
but then the lights became very painful.

105
00:11:08,816 --> 00:11:12,384
– But the worst is the neon lights?

106
00:11:12,656 --> 00:11:13,836
– It’s not the neon light.

107
00:11:13,936 --> 00:11:18,708
It’s because there is a spool, a coil that makes alternating magnetic fields.

108
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:24,344
If they took away the spool the neon would be like any other light.

109
00:11:24,585 --> 00:11:31,508
But there is a long coil they call the ballast that keeps the current running

110
00:11:31,749 --> 00:11:37,654
and that sends out thousand nanotesla in half a meter.

111
00:11:37,908 --> 00:11:42,764
I can feel these things in long distance. Through the walls.

112
00:11:43,544 --> 00:11:53,014
There’s a couple of strange symptoms that I noted down because my memory is going really bad.

113
00:11:53,268 --> 00:11:58,629
I had to learn some memory techniques to pass these courses.

114
00:11:58,729 --> 00:12:07,864
But when there is electrical sensitivity thirst is increased. I get very thirsty.

115
00:12:08,105 --> 00:12:16,549
I can watch TV but if I read and the TV is on there’s 10 times more pain.

116
00:12:16,824 --> 00:12:22,949
If I concentrate on something else then it gets more painful.

117
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:42,149
There is some more but... But those are associated with electrical disturbance.

118
00:12:42,424 --> 00:12:54,788
- Any other?
– Better from reading. Just generally.

119
00:12:54,939 --> 00:13:00,175
But when I have electrical sensitivity I’m worse from reading.

120
00:13:01,545 --> 00:13:07,488
If I sit the near the thing there...

121
00:13:07,588 --> 00:13:10,732
and lately in the middle of the night I wake up

122
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:18,045
with where the dark field of vision has this net floating across.

123
00:13:18,145 --> 00:13:29,932
- Fine net in the vision.
– Those kinds of disturbances.

124
00:13:30,188 --> 00:13:33,262
And in the morning sometimes I wake up

125
00:13:33,305 --> 00:13:45,292
with a burning pain on the right side of the tongue the last few years.

126
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:53,367
And I have lots of urinary symptoms

127
00:13:53,467 --> 00:14:00,652
because I run all the time.Mild prostatitis probably kind of symptoms.

128
00:14:01,147 --> 00:14:08,332
I think it gets worse when there is electricity and I have to drink and run.

129
00:14:08,388 --> 00:14:12,844
– Do you have frequent urination?

130
00:14:12,944 --> 00:14:20,385
– Yes. Especially in the morning from 5-7 a.m.

131
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:26,531
And if I go and take a walk, every half an hour I have to urinate a lot.

132
00:14:30,887 --> 00:14:40,765
And the stool has been loose in 1986 I was getting sick, cold,

133
00:14:40,865 --> 00:14:43,425
just a fly comes by and I got sick.

134
00:14:43,664 --> 00:14:53,665
I went to this biopath treatment where they gave me medicines for clean up.

135
00:14:53,904 --> 00:15:03,287
For 1 year I had diarrhea and since then the stool has been loose and frequent.

136
00:15:03,387 --> 00:15:04,931
- They damaged the flora.

137
00:15:05,185 --> 00:15:11,805
– Yes. And then there was the clean up and then I got better.

138
00:15:11,905 --> 00:15:18,912
– In theory, yes.
– Before there was no problem.

139
00:15:19,012 --> 00:15:25,048
– Do you have any effect when there are electrical changes in the weather,

140
00:15:25,148 --> 00:15:26,692
like before a thunderstorm?

141
00:15:26,946 --> 00:15:30,628
– I noticed a little bit but it does not bother me.

142
00:15:30,895 --> 00:15:38,726
I hate cold, wet weather. I really hate it with passion!

143
00:15:38,826 --> 00:15:43,395
Living in Denmark is a little bit strange though. I still have kids there.

144
00:15:43,488 --> 00:15:46,572
– How do you feel here?
– I love the warmth!

145
00:15:47,067 --> 00:15:53,228
I like the Amazon, my wife is from Brazil and we go to the middle of Amazon and I feel great.

146
00:15:54,252 --> 00:15:57,307
– You mean in the jungle?

147
00:15:57,407 --> 00:16:04,987
– Yes. When I was a child living in Norway for a couple of years I had colds all the time.

148
00:16:05,062 --> 00:16:08,387
Then we moved to South America and it was gone.

149
00:16:08,654 --> 00:16:15,054
– South America, where?
– North of Venezuela, a little Dutch place.

150
00:16:15,105 --> 00:16:16,888
The Dutch where hanging around some islands.

151
00:16:16,988 --> 00:16:28,257
– In the seaside?
– Yes, it was a little bit like Alonissos. Same size.

152
00:16:28,508 --> 00:16:30,717
– Your father is still alive?

153
00:16:30,817 --> 00:16:35,811
– Yes, he is 84 but he is just about to take the jump.

154
00:16:36,065 --> 00:16:41,424
My mother is also alive. They are very healthy.

155
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:45,025
My grandfather... they all lived to 84.

156
00:16:45,264 --> 00:16:54,501
– It’s the limit! So they know when and where to go.

157
00:16:58,341 --> 00:17:02,081
– And my health was always very good.

158
00:17:02,181 --> 00:17:04,125
– Did you have any acutes?

159
00:17:04,225 --> 00:17:07,506
– Yes, when I was 31 I had chickenpox

160
00:17:07,747 --> 00:17:12,626
because I didn’t get sleep one night, I was near a kindergarten.

161
00:17:13,142 --> 00:17:15,186
– At 31?
– Yes.

162
00:17:15,427 --> 00:17:16,366
– Was it heavy?

163
00:17:16,466 --> 00:17:19,531
– Yes, it was all over. I was covered with spots.

164
00:17:19,631 --> 00:17:42,367
– Anything else?
– Yes, in 1986 I got mumps. I never take any medicine.

165
00:17:42,467 --> 00:17:46,061
– Since when you are married? Since what age?

166
00:17:46,076 --> 00:17:51,026
– I have been married thrice. 3 times.

167
00:17:51,267 --> 00:17:54,617
– When was the third time?
– 4 years ago.

168
00:17:54,866 --> 00:18:04,067
– The second time?
– That was in 1983.

169
00:18:05,868 --> 00:18:15,304
– And how long you lived together?
– 6 years or so.

170
00:18:15,823 --> 00:18:24,013
– From 1983 to 1990. Then she threw me out.

171
00:18:24,264 --> 00:18:26,063
– She threw you out?
– Yes.

172
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:34,504
– Why? Because you were a bad guy?
- No, she found another guy.

173
00:18:34,748 --> 00:18:39,868
– But what about you? Going out sometimes?

174
00:18:40,143 --> 00:18:44,744
 Having affairs?
– No, no.

175
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:55,668
– All men are good.
– One at a time!

176
00:18:56,948 --> 00:19:03,864
– That doesn’t fit my thinking...

177
00:19:04,374 --> 00:19:15,327
If you go swim, after swimming you feel rejuvenated, good?
– I love swimming. I feel good, yes.

178
00:19:15,427 --> 00:19:17,364
– Really good?
– Yes, really good.

179
00:19:17,464 --> 00:19:19,548
– Do you know the remedy which is better (in the sea)?

180
00:19:19,823 --> 00:19:22,008
– Med.
– Did you take Med.?

181
00:19:22,108 --> 00:19:25,814
– I was thinking of it but then I took Tub.

182
00:19:26,068 --> 00:19:28,628
because my mother was afraid of animals all the time

183
00:19:28,869 --> 00:19:32,214
and I didn’t feel good after I got tuberculous vaccine.

184
00:19:32,709 --> 00:19:38,614
And I love to travel. I thought maybe there is a nosode blocking so I took.

185
00:19:38,868 --> 00:19:41,944
But then I couldn’t lift my arm, my right arm.

186
00:19:42,185 --> 00:19:43,734
– After Tub.?
– Yes,

187
00:19:43,988 --> 00:19:47,828
then it got to the deltoid muscle and I had a big pain here.

188
00:19:48,344 --> 00:19:53,189
So for 3 months I couldn’t lift my right arm. Still a little bit.

189
00:19:53,464 --> 00:19:57,545
Then it went to the left one, a little bit.

190
00:19:58,825 --> 00:20:01,654
– Did you ever had any gonorrhea?

191
00:20:01,908 --> 00:20:08,420
– I had once a chancre on the penis when I was 22.

192
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:15,828
– It means syphilis?
– No, kind of ulcer. And I went to the doctor.

193
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,890
– And she gave you penicillin?

194
00:20:18,144 --> 00:20:21,448
– No, he didn’t give me anything, he said it wasn’t anything.

195
00:20:22,746 --> 00:20:27,584
– Was any discharge from the urethra ever?
– No.

196
00:20:28,107 --> 00:20:45,268
– Sure? Around 1983-1984?
– No, when I had that one I was 23, in 1968.

197
00:20:50,144 --> 00:20:59,866
– When you were around 40-43?
– No problem.

198
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:06,266
– No infection from any woman and you had to take antibiotics?

199
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:12,320
– No, never. I took antibiotics when I was 9 months old.

200
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,708
But it wasn’t my decision.

201
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:23,360
I had pneumonia and it was in Chicago, there was a great new invention, penicillin.

202
00:21:24,705 --> 00:21:30,702
My father was very proud because he had used this modern medicine.

203
00:21:30,945 --> 00:21:36,727
Otherwise I have stayed away from all medicines.

204
00:21:36,827 --> 00:21:43,912
– Since the age of? When did you become aware that the antibiotics are bad?

205
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:50,907
– I just knew it. Internal knowledge.

206
00:21:51,007 --> 00:21:54,372
– And you avoid them all your life?
– Yes.

207
00:21:54,472 --> 00:21:56,207
– And you were able to avoid it?

208
00:21:56,307 --> 00:22:01,699
– Yes, if I got headache I don’t take anything.

209
00:22:03,748 --> 00:22:11,152
– What position do you keep in bed?
– There is a thing there.

210
00:22:11,428 --> 00:22:19,347
I had a back problem in 1989.

211
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:23,785
Suddenly I was carrying so many things and then boom!

212
00:22:23,854 --> 00:22:26,667
And I was flat on my back for 3 weeks,

213
00:22:26,736 --> 00:22:33,585
being carried back and forth to the chiropractor, which I didn’t like very much.

214
00:22:33,826 --> 00:22:37,388
I had to use a ladder to move around to get to the toilet

215
00:22:37,627 --> 00:22:39,425
because I just couldn’t stand up.

216
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:42,508
This was probably because of the overload,

217
00:22:42,547 --> 00:22:46,587
I was a sailor once and I lifted many things.

218
00:22:46,862 --> 00:22:52,748
But then it took me several years, I did yoga exercise.

219
00:22:53,628 --> 00:22:56,708
– To strengthen the muscles.
– Yes, then I was ok.

220
00:22:56,975 --> 00:23:02,095
Then I go once a year or twice to chiropractor and after taking homeopathic medicine

221
00:23:02,346 --> 00:23:04,388
then there is no problem.

222
00:23:10,788 --> 00:23:17,706
– Which remedies of the ones that you mentioned acted on you, you remember?

223
00:23:17,945 --> 00:23:24,984
– I have them written down here. I sleep on the left side.

224
00:23:25,494 --> 00:23:27,544
The sleep on the right side is painful.

225
00:23:27,785 --> 00:23:30,345
– Because of this incident?
- Probably.

226
00:23:31,748 --> 00:23:36,684
– Calc. helped you?
– No, then I got very depressed.

227
00:23:37,464 --> 00:23:46,149
Then I got more dry skin on the fingers because I have problem here with the fingers too.

228
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:52,208
– You still have dry skin.
– Yes. I just got depressed.

229
00:23:52,308 --> 00:24:02,905
Nat-m. 1M was the first remedy; then I became open for a couple of hours. I am fairly open

230
00:24:03,152 --> 00:24:08,448
but so opened that people would come and sit on the bench next to me and talk.

231
00:24:08,548 --> 00:24:11,020
I thought this was really amazing.

232
00:24:11,268 --> 00:24:12,428
– You attracted.
– Yes.

233
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:15,745
I was magnetizing people come sit down and talk to me.

234
00:24:18,828 --> 00:24:24,972
Then I took Nat-c. LM to 20LM for 2 years.

235
00:24:25,467 --> 00:24:31,372
The homeopath said you must be Nat-c. Then I thought probably I am.

236
00:24:32,352 --> 00:24:41,612
So I took slowly LM to 20LM and then I started to really prove it at 20LM,

237
00:24:41,868 --> 00:24:45,985
I hated people, I couldn’t stand anybody getting near me.

238
00:24:46,224 --> 00:24:51,521
At the bus stop I would stand far away from the people.

239
00:24:51,621 --> 00:24:54,428
I couldn’t stand Danish people anymore.

240
00:24:54,692 --> 00:24:58,268
– That’s not because of Nat-c. most probably.

241
00:25:02,108 --> 00:25:06,977
– This isn’t it because I found that with any homeopathic remedy

242
00:25:07,492 --> 00:25:10,545
I would be a little bit better with electricity.

243
00:25:10,817 --> 00:25:19,777
But nothing cured. With Kali-p. I got paralysis of the arms.

244
00:25:21,372 --> 00:25:27,972
Weakness and dullness in the brain LM and 2LM.

245
00:25:28,465 --> 00:25:35,388
– That’s very good.
– Lyc. no reaction. Sil. tired and depressed.

246
00:25:35,652 --> 00:25:49,468
Nux-v. the electricity sensitivity went way very bad with LM. I call it e-llergy.

247
00:25:53,308 --> 00:26:03,548
But with Nux-v. I became very sensitive. With Phos. I had a big cough.

248
00:26:05,857 --> 00:26:13,265
Spig. I met (doctor name) in Oslo and I gave him 2 symptoms

249
00:26:13,537 --> 00:26:17,528
from when I was on the plane and I was in a certain seat of the plane

250
00:26:17,628 --> 00:26:21,725
and when it lands it was like somebody sticks a big needle into my eye.

251
00:26:21,825 --> 00:26:24,100
It was like that while it was landing.

252
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:31,508
And he just heard that and said it’s Spig. But that didn’t do anything.

253
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:36,900
Arn. I took because these bicycles they have these chains

254
00:26:37,146 --> 00:26:41,250
and I locked it and it recoiled and hit my right testicle,

255
00:26:41,504 --> 00:26:47,904
which was very painful and then I took Arn. 200C and it got better.

256
00:26:47,953 --> 00:26:54,305
I have a spermatocele there which is painful the day after intercourse.

257
00:26:54,826 --> 00:26:58,666
Otherwise when I get very bad I get Hyper.

258
00:26:58,935 --> 00:27:03,545
If I am in a plane and there are 50 TVs and I have to be there for 8 hours

259
00:27:04,545 --> 00:27:12,505
and I am really in torture then I take Hyper. To sort of put a little wall up.

260
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:17,625
I took some last night because there was a motor running in the house

261
00:27:17,866 --> 00:27:20,944
and I had to go out in the street because it was too much pain.

262
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:24,464
– In the house?
– Where I am staying.

263
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:28,304
– In the next room?
– Yes or upstairs or somewhere.

264
00:27:28,545 --> 00:27:32,285
There was a fan or something running and that gives a strong pain

265
00:27:32,385 --> 00:27:37,926
and then it goes in the nervous system and I get like this and I have to go out.

266
00:27:38,026 --> 00:27:39,905
– So you feel best in a forest?

267
00:27:40,172 --> 00:27:44,268
– Not in a forest but in the warm climate, like here.

268
00:27:44,782 --> 00:27:50,145
This is a sensible climate. But up in the north it’s dark and grey.

269
00:27:50,396 --> 00:27:58,348
And people get like that too. I like more the bright people.

270
00:27:59,105 --> 00:28:07,052
– Class is enjoying your description. Your symptomatology.
– That’s good.

271
00:28:07,547 --> 00:28:14,732
But it’s a very disabling thing because all my education, all my experience is out of the window.

272
00:28:14,988 --> 00:28:17,687
I have a trouble to find an office for Homeopathy

273
00:28:17,787 --> 00:28:28,216
because in the business section you always have some motors running; air-condition, PC...

274
00:28:28,465 --> 00:28:34,348
- We are encircled totally by electricity. We cannot escape.

275
00:28:35,382 --> 00:28:40,748
But I want to ask you a few more questions. Do you take fruits?

276
00:28:41,017 --> 00:28:44,857
– I like fruits.
– Sour or sweetish?

277
00:28:45,106 --> 00:28:49,462
– I don’t like sour fruits so much.
– Oranges?

278
00:28:49,708 --> 00:29:02,777
– Yes. Especially I like peaches, bananas and cherries.

279
00:29:03,857 --> 00:29:09,588
– What about fatty food?
– I don’t like fat food and I don’t eat meat.

280
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:18,304
Not because I don’t like it but in 1986 I would get very sleepy after eating beef.

281
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:28,026
And then I heard they put all the hormones so my mind just dropped it.

282
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:34,426
But I eat chicken and fish.
– You like very much chicken and fish?

283
00:29:34,673 --> 00:29:36,686
– Ok.
– Sweets?

284
00:29:36,786 --> 00:29:38,484
– No, I don’t like so much.

285
00:29:38,784 --> 00:29:41,426
Ice cream?
– It’s ok.

286
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:43,863
– Your nails are strong?

287
00:29:44,104 --> 00:29:49,188
– Usually but now they got brittle and I have a lot of in-growing toe nails.

288
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:53,785
– After Sil. this happened?
– No. It has been like that for many years.

289
00:29:54,308 --> 00:30:00,460
All toes. I have to watch it.

290
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:09,145
– You have salivation during sleep?
– No.

291
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:13,508
– You have strong teeth or problems?

292
00:30:13,775 --> 00:30:23,748
– Ok. I had a lot of mercury fillings which were removed in 1987.

293
00:30:24,015 --> 00:30:26,475
– They thought maybe that was the problem.

294
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:31,269
– Yes, the migraines. Then I was suffering from these migraines,

295
00:30:31,544 --> 00:30:36,905
very peculiar migraines, they were just coming once every 3 months.

296
00:30:37,174 --> 00:30:44,344
– Now they don’t come?
– No. They come in a very mild form once a year.

297
00:30:44,444 --> 00:30:51,408
– These headaches were removed after the fillings were taken out?

298
00:30:51,508 --> 00:30:58,424
– Yes. Mostly gone.
– There is any metallic taste in the mouth?

299
00:30:58,665 --> 00:31:04,249
– No. But previously before the fillings.

300
00:31:04,349 --> 00:31:07,424
He said there was a lot of voltage in some of them.

301
00:31:07,468 --> 00:31:10,148
– You never took Merc. as a homeopathic remedy?

302
00:31:10,415 --> 00:31:16,025
– No. I’ve thought about it but I never...

303
00:31:17,828 --> 00:31:20,655
- Did you take any Caust.?

304
00:31:20,906 --> 00:31:25,508
– No, I thought about that too but I just stayed away from anything.

305
00:31:29,615 --> 00:31:37,546
I thought of Caust., Sulph.,Zinc. and Merc. But I leave it up to you.

306
00:31:46,745 --> 00:31:55,215
I like salt too. I buy sticks with salt on them.

307
00:31:55,705 --> 00:32:03,660
– You like salt very much?
– I would give it a 2.

308
00:32:04,665 --> 00:32:13,135
– What about salty fish?
– Not so much.

309
00:32:14,415 --> 00:32:27,166
– The fat of the meat... definitely not. Always.

310
00:32:27,266 --> 00:32:30,785
Do you remember any fears in childhood? You have any fears now?

311
00:32:31,308 --> 00:32:40,268
– No. I fear heights.
– Strong fear of heights?

312
00:32:41,248 --> 00:32:47,082
– Not so strong that if I see on TV there is a problem if somebody else falls down and not me.

313
00:32:47,182 --> 00:32:51,024
If I go high up somewhere and I look down I don’t like that.

314
00:32:51,301 --> 00:32:58,211
– Another fear? Fear of dark? Fear of being alone? Fear of people?

315
00:32:58,465 --> 00:33:05,104
– Fear of sharks maybe. But that’s not in the repertory.

316
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:10,747
But only when I am swimming.

317
00:33:14,064 --> 00:33:21,821
–Snakes, no?
– A little bit. I don’t like them.

318
00:33:21,921 --> 00:33:28,908
A little bit black dogs. Big ones.

319
00:33:29,147 --> 00:33:37,345
– The big shepherd?
– Not the shepherd but the black one.

320
00:33:37,868 --> 00:33:42,988
– Doberman?
 – That’s the one! Rottweiler!

321
00:33:43,227 --> 00:33:47,342
– We go into the class so the class can ask you some questions.

322
00:33:49,132 --> 00:33:55,532
Do you have question that you want to put to this very interesting case?

323
00:34:02,945 --> 00:34:08,065
– Can you tell me if you perspire easily?

324
00:34:08,332 --> 00:34:15,227
– Yes, if it’s warm. When it’s warm and there’s exertion otherwise no.

325
00:34:15,502 --> 00:34:17,548
– Is offensive?
– Not.

326
00:34:17,787 --> 00:34:23,425
It can be really warm and I still don’t perspire nor do I get thirsty.

327
00:34:23,692 --> 00:34:27,265
– Your thirst is normal?
– I drink a lot.

328
00:34:27,516 --> 00:34:31,628
– Cold water? Very cold?
– No. I don’t like cold.

329
00:34:31,867 --> 00:34:39,822
– Are you very fastidious?
– Not at all. My wife is more that way.

330
00:34:46,222 --> 00:34:52,948
- You don’t need any more questions. The remedy is very clear?

331
00:34:54,746 --> 00:35:10,104
Good luck. Carc., Caust., Med... but he refuses.

332
00:35:11,027 --> 00:35:20,104
Let’s see the repertorization. Cold and wet.

333
00:35:20,378 --> 00:35:37,143
When you hear this your mind should go to Dulc., Calc., Rhus-t., Calc-p.

334
00:35:37,384 --> 00:35:43,543
and your mind could also go to Nat-s.

335
00:35:45,338 --> 00:35:48,563
Which is the best of these remedies?

336
00:35:48,663 --> 00:35:55,664
Calc. So, it’s a very easy case.

337
00:35:55,707 --> 00:35:59,864
But he said he took Calc. and nothing happened.

338
00:36:00,144 --> 00:36:03,704
On the contrary he felt depressed.

339
00:36:03,984 --> 00:36:07,967
Therefore Bell. is the best next possibility.

340
00:36:08,067 --> 00:36:14,866
We give Bell. because of the headaches. Because of the cold feet.

341
00:36:15,138 --> 00:36:17,944
Your feet are cold?
– Yes.

342
00:36:18,191 --> 00:36:23,311
– I can make a Bell. case for him! I can push the questions.

343
00:36:24,591 --> 00:36:27,577
What about your head? Is it hot? No.

344
00:36:27,826 --> 00:36:33,977
He feels hot after the electricity. Bell.

345
00:36:37,302 --> 00:36:41,388
Desire for travelling and all that.

346
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:44,982
But would you give Bell. in this case?

347
00:36:45,228 --> 00:36:49,068
It’s very doubtful. I would not give Bell.

348
00:36:49,827 --> 00:36:53,177
Because I am not happy with Bell.

349
00:36:53,426 --> 00:36:57,266
Even the headaches that would be supporting are gone.

350
00:36:57,807 --> 00:37:03,504
And the headaches had to be Bell. headaches. They were not.

351
00:37:03,747 --> 00:37:08,867
And then next remedy is Con.

352
00:37:09,118 --> 00:37:18,864
In Con. you need to have at least the dizziness or the vertigo.

353
00:37:23,165 --> 00:37:27,504
He doesn’t complain of that.

354
00:37:27,747 --> 00:37:33,904
We go to Med. Med. is a possibility because he is quite open,

355
00:37:34,147 --> 00:37:45,667
communicative but in the history he denies. You know how precise I was.

356
00:37:46,647 --> 00:37:56,944
If he had got gonorrhea in 1983 by 1986 he could have developed this throat problem

357
00:37:57,187 --> 00:38:00,265
and then we would be sure.

358
00:38:00,304 --> 00:38:08,504
Also except from better in the sea he does not have any other keynotes of Med.

359
00:38:09,294 --> 00:38:15,184
Do your feet burn and stick them out of covers?
– No.

360
00:38:15,427 --> 00:38:17,987
– They’re rather cold.

361
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:23,625
So, therefore Med. which appears to be a good prescription is not there.

362
00:38:23,864 --> 00:38:26,424
Let’s ask for Caust.

363
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:34,384
Because of the paralysis which happened several times and the throat one thinks of.

364
00:38:34,627 --> 00:38:37,187
But... there is a big but.

365
00:38:37,454 --> 00:38:51,024
Caust. is better with cold wet. Maybe in this case is not so.

366
00:38:51,534 --> 00:39:00,546
But we don’t have the sweets, he likes sweets, there is no aversion to sweets.

367
00:39:00,813 --> 00:39:03,624
Where shall we base our prescription on Caust.?

368
00:39:04,143 --> 00:39:13,346
What symptomatology? What about injustice? Tell us.

369
00:39:13,613 --> 00:39:17,186
– I don’t jump up and down.

370
00:39:21,788 --> 00:39:27,944
– He has some very strong symptoms of Calc-p.

371
00:39:28,188 --> 00:39:32,303
That is mind, sensitivity, electricity to.

372
00:39:32,813 --> 00:39:38,703
The second is wet cold weather aggravates, Travelling, desire for.

373
00:39:38,946 --> 00:39:42,786
Larynx, trachea, scraping sensation, tries to clear the larynx.

374
00:39:43,053 --> 00:39:46,383
Desire salt and fear of high places.

375
00:39:46,893 --> 00:39:53,385
And he has also the general physique of Calc-p.

376
00:39:53,654 --> 00:39:56,984
Obese type and round one.

377
00:40:01,549 --> 00:40:17,306
– Calc-p. is one of the remedies that should come to mind and I believe Calc-p...

378
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:23,188
- There is one thing I would like to mention that I don’t like people walking behind me.

379
00:40:28,308 --> 00:40:35,490
It’s uncomfortable. Even if it is 5 meters or more.

380
00:40:35,744 --> 00:40:42,144
– Put that into repertorization. Fear of people behind.

381
00:40:46,228 --> 00:40:48,190
– You say you don’t like sharks

382
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:51,342
but I think most of us here don’t like sharks either.

383
00:40:51,585 --> 00:40:57,228
But is it when you are swimming can you swim out of your depth comfortably?

384
00:40:57,467 --> 00:41:01,456
– Yes, but I am worried about sharks when I’m swim out in deep.

385
00:41:01,707 --> 00:41:05,058
It doesn’t have to be so deep because they can come in quite shallow.

386
00:41:05,104 --> 00:41:07,343
– Even when you were a child did you have fears

387
00:41:07,586 --> 00:41:10,146
what was in the room, what was hidden, shadows?

388
00:41:10,908 --> 00:41:21,148
– No.
– Med. Has come up. Show me Calc-p.

389
00:41:26,786 --> 00:41:31,388
– Scraping throat, disposition to hawk, weakness of the memory,

390
00:41:31,663 --> 00:41:35,503
mental exertion aggravates, desire travelling, weather cold, wet,

391
00:41:35,746 --> 00:41:40,623
salt desire, high places... very good.

392
00:41:49,826 --> 00:41:59,328
– What I thought was quite exceptional that he children diseases at the age of 31 and 41...

393
00:41:59,428 --> 00:42:01,175
- So what you make out of that?

394
00:42:01,226 --> 00:42:11,466
– Well, I think there must be a deep pathology lying underneath this problem.

395
00:42:12,295 --> 00:42:14,107
– Why? Because of these acutes?

396
00:42:14,625 --> 00:42:22,051
– No because his system wasn’t able to have those diseases when he was a child.

397
00:42:22,305 --> 00:42:23,546
When he should have had them.

398
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:36,622
Therefore he got it later and that means that his system is not responding correctly.

399
00:42:39,425 --> 00:42:42,252
– We have a different opinion here.

400
00:42:44,545 --> 00:42:55,052
I consider those who get children diseases lucky people who have good constitution.

401
00:42:55,822 --> 00:43:00,667
Unfortunately today we cannot get any more children diseases

402
00:43:00,942 --> 00:43:08,622
unless you go to places like S. America or India, Africa etc.

403
00:43:08,865 --> 00:43:15,265
then you will get children diseases but here you don’t get them.

404
00:43:15,902 --> 00:43:19,945
According to the theory that we have been teaching here

405
00:43:20,184 --> 00:43:25,065
that shows a very low level of general health.

406
00:43:26,345 --> 00:43:31,984
The fact that he got shows rather a good constitution.

407
00:43:32,227 --> 00:43:38,627
The fact that he did not get it in early age and he got it later is not so important.

408
00:43:38,894 --> 00:43:41,187
Important is that he got it.

409
00:43:41,454 --> 00:43:48,344
And according to the levels of health there are only certain levels of health

410
00:43:48,624 --> 00:43:54,744
on the upper side that can get children’s epidemic diseases.

411
00:43:55,024 --> 00:44:00,905
If they don’t get epidemic diseases, this is a bad sign.

412
00:44:01,144 --> 00:44:06,025
Show me any autistic child who got epidemic disease,

413
00:44:06,264 --> 00:44:10,384
show me any schizophrenic child, show me any epileptic child,

414
00:44:10,627 --> 00:44:23,694
show me any diabetic child, show me any severely ill with systemic diseases.

415
00:44:24,574 --> 00:44:36,494
Like SLE, Still disease... And cancer.

416
00:44:41,381 --> 00:44:50,587
Put all these children inside an incubator with all these viruses and bacteria.

417
00:44:50,851 --> 00:45:02,371
They don’t get. The same with schizophrenics while in asylum they sleep in terrible conditions.

418
00:45:02,625 --> 00:45:07,227
Sometimes it was found out that in an asylum

419
00:45:07,491 --> 00:45:15,171
people were sleeping in mud and not getting anything.

420
00:45:15,664 --> 00:45:23,621
The organism becomes so strong, so violent, it kills all the bacteria...

421
00:45:25,665 --> 00:45:30,892
These are points which I brought out in the teaching of Homeopathy.

422
00:45:31,387 --> 00:45:34,732
There are all things that have to be investigated.

423
00:45:34,988 --> 00:45:38,062
They have to be listened and to be investigated

424
00:45:38,305 --> 00:45:45,228
so the whole attitude toward Medicine should eventually change.

425
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:49,825
Medicine has not taken the right way of thinking.

426
00:45:50,092 --> 00:45:54,702
It’s a wrong way of thinking for Conventional Medicine

427
00:45:54,945 --> 00:46:00,065
and the time will come when they will take into consideration all these ideas

428
00:46:00,332 --> 00:46:05,947
and then they will find out the beginning.

429
00:46:07,227 --> 00:46:10,305
– One more symptom I found of Calc-p.

430
00:46:10,428 --> 00:46:24,421
In the rubric skin, electric sparks, sensation, as from electric, 2 marks.

431
00:46:24,567 --> 00:46:29,425
– This is something different from what he says. It is an electric spark.

432
00:46:29,666 --> 00:46:34,296
For instance you sit there and there is a kind of discharge of electricity.

433
00:46:35,576 --> 00:46:46,065
It’s like a hit by electricity. This is true. Calc-p. is a good prescription.

434
00:46:46,306 --> 00:46:51,212
There is no question but I still would like another remedy.

435
00:46:51,468 --> 00:46:52,987
Which is this remedy?

436
00:46:53,262 --> 00:46:56,332
I will show you because it’s difficult to find this remedy.

437
00:46:56,588 --> 00:47:03,827
I will show you this M.M. from Clark.

438
00:47:07,665 --> 00:47:12,785
– I don’t know if it’s important but I worked with a lot of chemicals for a couple of years.

439
00:47:13,057 --> 00:47:21,506
Mainly Caust.
– Caust. is a chemical which doesn’t exist.

440
00:47:21,745 --> 00:47:25,092
– Caustic soda.
– Caustic soda is not Caust.

441
00:47:25,346 --> 00:47:34,306
– In petroleum industry.
– What year?

442
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:51,708
– 1977 to 1979.
– What bloody did they inject in my organism?

443
00:47:52,737 --> 00:48:04,508
It was blue here. I don’t feel anything here. Just numb.

444
00:48:04,772 --> 00:48:09,005
The dentist told me for 5 weeks you will not feel anything here.

445
00:48:09,105 --> 00:48:17,507
First time I hear that. What was this? For 5 weeks I will be numb here.

446
00:48:18,787 --> 00:48:25,462
Cannot feel anything. Don’t anybody kiss me here, I will not understand anything.

447
00:48:35,064 --> 00:48:40,694
As you know there are several remedies prescribed in this case

448
00:48:40,948 --> 00:48:48,869
but this is a case in which I will prescribe a remedy which I never prescribed before.

449
00:48:50,149 --> 00:48:57,588
This is the first time I am going to prescribe this remedy for this nice gentleman.

450
00:48:58,104 --> 00:49:07,064
The reason is because he has been given certain remedies which had an effect, especially Nat-m.

451
00:49:07,305 --> 00:49:09,865
He said he opened etc.

452
00:49:10,134 --> 00:49:16,534
There was definitely some effect upon his character, he was closed, now he is not closed at all.

453
00:49:17,029 --> 00:49:18,825
I can be closed but not him.

454
00:49:21,385 --> 00:49:38,294
The remedies had an effect but we did not have the effect of the last effect upon his organism.

455
00:49:40,354 --> 00:49:49,163
We do not touch this. And maybe we have to take the first layer out.

456
00:49:49,263 --> 00:49:58,307
And then go to the next remedy. Which is this layer out?

457
00:50:01,142 --> 00:50:10,964
Anybody has an idea? Show the M.M., don’t show the remedy.

458
00:50:11,064 --> 00:50:22,860
You showed it! The remedy is Electricitas.

459
00:50:25,987 --> 00:50:38,954
This is a case in which we can say that the remedy has created the problem.

460
00:50:39,054 --> 00:50:45,454
So it is isopathy but still may be the solution to the problem.

461
00:50:49,784 --> 00:50:55,694
And on the occasion of that I have to say a few things.

462
00:50:56,707 --> 00:51:06,704
Mostly that in order to have a remedy we have the possibility this remedy can create symptoms.

463
00:51:07,214 --> 00:51:23,021
Because in our M.M. there are remedies like the Luna or the Sun

464
00:51:23,264 --> 00:51:30,187
or such nonsense which cannot be used as remedies.

465
00:51:30,426 --> 00:51:34,266
And then some people ask me what about electricity.

466
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:40,727
Electricity can produce symptomatology and therefore it can cure it.

467
00:51:40,884 --> 00:51:43,788
Unless you have the possibility of that substance

468
00:51:44,057 --> 00:51:55,577
which you are proving can create symptom it cannot cure them.

469
00:51:55,826 --> 00:52:00,182
You know the idea of potentizing a song.

470
00:52:01,577 --> 00:52:09,388
You put your gramophone in front of this and you have the national anthem of Danish people.

471
00:52:09,657 --> 00:52:19,897
And then you give it. Such crazy things are circulated within the homeopathic profession.

472
00:52:20,146 --> 00:52:33,977
This is unfortunate. Potentize an Indian song and then give it.

473
00:52:45,446 --> 00:52:50,664
Headache, hysteria, paralysis, rheumatism, we go further.

474
00:52:50,938 --> 00:52:55,543
Caspari is the authority for the symptom... Go down.

475
00:53:02,723 --> 00:53:07,467
Nervous tremors, anxiety, fear, restlessness.

476
00:53:07,706 --> 00:53:14,896
Violent headaches, palpitations, swelling of parts, are among the most prominent symptoms.

477
00:53:14,947 --> 00:53:21,586
Has related a umber of cases in which the injudicious use of electric baths brought on phthisis.

478
00:53:21,686 --> 00:53:28,272
In another case the chest and arms became stiff and paralyzed.

479
00:53:28,348 --> 00:53:30,067
This is very interesting.

480
00:53:34,372 --> 00:53:38,149
A young married woman who had general and local (uterine) electric treatment,

481
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:45,065
complained after it of feeling very heavy, as if she weighed a ton.

482
00:53:45,945 --> 00:53:53,268
One patient after a bath said his chest and shoulders “felt like marble”.

483
00:53:55,828 --> 00:54:03,649
The action of the remedy upon the points which he complained.

484
00:54:03,749 --> 00:54:09,144
He became phthisical and died.

485
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:16,184
The paralysis caused by electricity was in several cases quickly relieved

486
00:54:16,425 --> 00:54:22,725
but Morphine, both in the solution and in the potencies.

487
00:54:22,825 --> 00:54:26,732
Antidoted by Morphine. I have found Phos. the best antidote.

488
00:54:26,745 --> 00:54:36,566
Electricity antidotes Merc. Go to symptoms. Mind.

489
00:54:36,666 --> 00:54:52,066
Let see which are the symptoms. M.M. Tears, sometimes with timidity.

490
00:54:52,346 --> 00:54:56,427
Sighs, sometimes with tears; the patient cries a lot.

491
00:54:56,696 --> 00:55:01,497
Restlessness, anxiety, anguish, sometimes more particularly in the chest;

492
00:55:01,746 --> 00:55:09,326
internal anguish, violent agitation, timidity, fear of the approach of a storm.

493
00:55:09,426 --> 00:55:11,886
Ill-humour. Involuntary laughter.

494
00:55:11,986 --> 00:55:21,892
Loss of consciousness, insensibility, foolish action, errors in the appreciation of time.

495
00:55:24,917 --> 00:55:46,212
Loss of memory, confusion of head... Vertigo, cephalalgia, pains in the head, sometimes drawing.

496
00:55:46,266 --> 00:55:52,348
Bruise-like, pains in occiput. Crushing pressure in the forehead as from stone.

497
00:55:52,612 --> 00:55:57,468
Shooting in right side of head... Painful cramps.

498
00:55:57,486 --> 00:56:02,425
Disagreeable shaking. Show me the tongue.

499
00:56:03,215 --> 00:56:11,385
He said he wakes up with a painful spot in the tongue. Mouth.

500
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:33,828
Sensitiveness of the tongue, esp. at the point, which is also red.

501
00:56:34,067 --> 00:56:46,666
This is exactly what he had said. We don’t know if it’s red. Throat.

502
00:56:48,975 --> 00:57:05,100
Constant tickling in the throat. Face. Color, bright red.

503
00:57:05,615 --> 00:57:09,455
Increase of sweat on the face.

504
00:57:09,706 --> 00:57:15,340
– When I am affected by electricity then I get a cold sweat in the forehead.

505
00:57:16,868 --> 00:57:24,815
Urinary. He complained about frequent urination.

506
00:57:25,305 --> 00:57:27,905
Sensation as though the bladder were going to burst.

507
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:32,771
Very frequent emission of urine. Involuntary emission of urine.

508
00:57:33,464 --> 00:57:48,901
Urine in the morning... All this effect shows an effect on the prostate gland.

509
00:57:50,181 --> 00:58:07,067
So here we are justified to start with this remedy actually

510
00:58:09,104 --> 00:58:18,660
and after the antidoting of the electrical influence upon his organism

511
00:58:18,906 --> 00:58:23,183
most probably some symptoms will stay.

512
00:58:23,184 --> 00:58:30,065
May be the coughing, the choking, the hawking, maybe the headaches will come back. I don’t know.

513
00:58:31,096 --> 00:58:40,508
But I believe that this sensitivity to electricity will be reduced by taking Electricitas.

514
00:58:40,783 --> 00:58:44,348
If you find it in 30C or even 200C...

515
00:58:44,623 --> 00:58:54,588
You will have to take once every day for about a period of 15-20 days

516
00:58:54,863 --> 00:59:09,704
and if you feel better you can stop and as soon as you have a relapse you start and take it for 30 days.

517
00:59:09,948 --> 00:59:18,908
But if you little better and little better you continue taking it for 1-1,5 month.

518
00:59:19,183 --> 00:59:27,106
The problem is to find a pharmacy that will give you a correct remedy.

519
00:59:27,173 --> 00:59:33,773
I think you had a case. Can you relate the case you had?

520
00:59:42,733 --> 00:59:47,704
– It was a case I had.

521
00:59:47,804 --> 00:59:51,507
I got a phone call from this guy I on the day I was being assessed for registration

522
00:59:51,779 --> 00:59:55,865
for my society of homeopaths, that was in 1992.

523
00:59:56,112 --> 01:00:03,027
I had seen him maybe 1 week before and he had the worst skin eruption I had ever seen.

524
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:08,319
For those of you who are English and old enough you remember the Singing Detective

525
01:00:08,419 --> 01:00:13,188
where this guy had a very blistering and severe eczema.

526
01:00:14,335 --> 01:00:21,584
My patient’s skin was purple...
- Slowly please, I don’t understand.

527
01:00:22,625 --> 01:00:26,946
– Tell the essentials. Say how sensitive he was to electricity.

528
01:00:27,213 --> 01:00:31,548
– He had worked in an electricity power station.

529
01:00:31,823 --> 01:00:37,186
He had this horrible skin eruption and also had very severe anxiety as well.

530
01:00:38,023 --> 01:00:45,468
He said if they put a shed in the middle of that field I would go and sit there.

531
01:00:45,532 --> 01:00:49,372
Very anxious and terrible skin eruption.

532
01:00:49,472 --> 01:00:52,307
And I was working on this case and his mother has been in the hospital,

533
01:00:52,379 --> 01:00:56,865
his wife has been sick, there were other things going on and there was one thing I kept going back to,

534
01:00:57,145 --> 01:01:04,966
he said his problem had started when his shift pattern changed in the electricity substation.

535
01:01:05,066 --> 01:01:10,106
This is where huge voltages came through, transformed to small voltages.

536
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:14,980
So he was spending much more time exposed to this enormous voltage.

537
01:01:15,226 --> 01:01:18,720
And I phoned him up. And I said are you sure this is true

538
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:24,450
because I have been in Homeopathy 4 years and I thought this remedy is absurd.

539
01:01:24,704 --> 01:01:29,306
How can you potentize electricity? It’s impossible.

540
01:01:29,570 --> 01:01:34,180
He said I’m sure it’s true and that seemed to be true.

541
01:01:36,224 --> 01:01:43,546
I had a potency of Electricity 200C which maybe I would be hesitant to prescribe that high

542
01:01:43,821 --> 01:01:49,268
but it seemed right. So I gave it to him and 1 week later he phoned up

543
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:54,906
and he said the skin eruption is worse and this was the day I was being assessed

544
01:01:55,424 --> 01:02:00,290
and I said how it can be worse, it’s the worst skin eruption I’ve ever seen?

545
01:02:00,544 --> 01:02:05,908
I was being assessed and I was in the phone and I was trying to speak quietly

546
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:12,064
so this woman would not hear that I was such a terrible homeopath!

547
01:02:15,704 --> 01:02:24,610
I said this may be a good sign. Crossed my finger and my legs and my toes.

548
01:02:24,664 --> 01:02:28,705
And I said is it anything else that’s happening.

549
01:02:28,785 --> 01:02:33,725
He said the fine thing is I do feel better myself. I said ok, it’s good.

550
01:02:33,825 --> 01:02:38,316
And I saw him after 1 month and the place where I was working was in a shop,

551
01:02:38,416 --> 01:02:43,341
sold herbs and the therapists were back and this guy was early for his appointment

552
01:02:43,584 --> 01:02:47,947
and as he got passed the shop he was waving at me and smiling.

553
01:02:48,186 --> 01:02:55,004
And his skin was more than 50% better after one month.

554
01:02:55,104 --> 01:03:02,455
He was much better himself and his skin went on 100% better within a few months. One dose.
