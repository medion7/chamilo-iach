1
00:00:16,424 --> 00:00:27,425
This is a case of a young man 42 years old sent to us from an American homeopath

2
00:00:27,702 --> 00:00:38,617
who has been treating him for..
- 5-6 years but not in the states.

3
00:00:38,764 --> 00:00:48,268
I started in Israel with 2 homeopaths and then when I moved to the states I went to see [doctor’s name].

4
00:00:48,544 --> 00:00:57,528
– For how long have you been treated?
– 6 years ago.

5
00:00:58,508 --> 00:01:08,257
– And the remedies that you have taken so far?
– I have written down.

6
00:01:08,748 --> 00:01:17,464
– The remedies he has taken so far is Pod., Sulph., Onos.,

7
00:01:17,984 --> 00:01:45,292
Sil., Staph, Lyc., Nux-v., Nat-m. most probably, Agn., Sil. again,

8
00:01:45,544 --> 00:02:12,172
Bell., Calc., Lyc. and Nat-ar., Ars., Op., Sil., Lyc., Sel.

9
00:02:14,432 --> 00:02:21,624
From the remedies you have taken I can see your problem also.

10
00:02:24,184 --> 00:02:31,372
So what is your problem you better say it to yourself?

11
00:02:31,624 --> 00:02:39,024
– The main problem I have is when I am going to the bath I am not getting empty,

12
00:02:39,265 --> 00:02:47,734
never succeed to finish it at once so I have to go up to 10 times to the bathroom...

13
00:02:49,305 --> 00:02:53,004
- To empty your bowel.
– Right.

14
00:02:53,104 --> 00:02:56,637
– And you get a feeling that it is not emptied?

15
00:02:56,737 --> 00:03:04,144
– Right. I get the feeling, I get urge and I have to go again.

16
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:13,377
– After how long?
– Sometimes it’s up to 2 mins sometimes it’s up to 2 hours.

17
00:03:13,624 --> 00:03:17,464
There is not a pattern.

18
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:28,464
- Originally you have been treated by 2 homeopaths in Israel and by one homeopath in the States.

19
00:03:28,984 --> 00:03:35,628
– One of the remedies helped but...

20
00:03:35,904 --> 00:03:38,704
- Which one?
– The Pod.

21
00:03:39,224 --> 00:03:46,904
– The homeopath gave it to me and after 4-5 days it started to influence

22
00:03:47,148 --> 00:03:52,268
and for like a week I went once a day.

23
00:03:52,784 --> 00:03:56,624
– And why didn’t he give it to you again?

24
00:03:56,897 --> 00:04:00,464
– I think he gave it again to me but I don’t know why it is not listed.

25
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:21,984
It didn’t make any change. If I am not wrong he changed also the potency.

26
00:04:22,224 --> 00:04:27,617
– You got different potencies. Nothing.

27
00:04:27,864 --> 00:04:33,744
– But the first one worked for one week perfectly.

28
00:04:35,297 --> 00:04:39,137
– Do you have another problem?
– I’ve a running nose.

29
00:04:39,384 --> 00:04:47,064
It started 6 years before the stomach problem. It’s still running.

30
00:04:47,308 --> 00:04:51,664
It doesn’t bother me so much. It’s there.

31
00:04:53,708 --> 00:05:03,457
– Running nose...Water or mucus?
– Water, transparent.

32
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:09,452
– And every time you blow your nose?
– Yes.

33
00:05:09,704 --> 00:05:12,504
– Every time?
– Every time.

34
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,132
But now it is not bothering me so much.

35
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:21,228
Maybe because I have a bigger problem.

36
00:05:23,024 --> 00:05:25,704
– What is the bigger problem?

37
00:05:25,944 --> 00:05:42,412
– The stomach, the bowel problem. Sorry...

38
00:05:42,664 --> 00:05:46,264
When I have the bowel problem it also influences the urination,

39
00:05:46,508 --> 00:05:48,824
when I have to pee it also doesn’t empty.

40
00:05:49,068 --> 00:05:54,704
But when I have a good day with the bowel everything is also ok when I go to pee.

41
00:05:54,963 --> 00:06:03,424
– So, the urination stops and then starts again...

42
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:16,464
- I can also to pee an enormous amount of time but again when the bowel is kind of empty it is normal.

43
00:06:16,737 --> 00:06:20,304
– But otherwise you have to go very frequently.
–Yes.

44
00:06:20,577 --> 00:06:28,257
– Every few minutes?
– No. There is no pattern.

45
00:06:28,504 --> 00:06:35,937
Sometimes I have to one after another or 2-3 hours after.

46
00:06:44,384 --> 00:06:52,968
– What else?
– Problems? Nothing.

47
00:06:53,068 --> 00:06:57,782
– How is your energy?
– The energy is low.

48
00:06:58,024 --> 00:07:05,194
When the bowel is not really good I’m tired.

49
00:07:07,322 --> 00:07:16,982
– Your whole body is tired?
– When my bowel is good my body is ok.

50
00:07:17,224 --> 00:07:26,945
– What is your work?
– I am working with the internet for 1,5 year.

51
00:07:27,222 --> 00:07:32,342
– You’re a hacker?
– No! I’m from the good guys!

52
00:07:34,384 --> 00:07:42,064
– Are you very good in this
 – No. I’m more for the marketing.

53
00:07:42,582 --> 00:07:47,184
– Selling?
– Yes.

54
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:51,265
– You’re good in selling?
– I believe so.

55
00:07:51,784 --> 00:07:59,734
– What else? How is your health?

56
00:07:59,984 --> 00:08:11,745
– Like 6 years ago I had a blood test in the States for allergies

57
00:08:12,022 --> 00:08:18,422
and they’ve found many allergies; milk, sugar, wheat...

58
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:25,825
Like 15 different things and I stopped eating them for 5-6 months completely.

59
00:08:26,102 --> 00:08:30,184
No wheat, no pasta, no bread, nothing.

60
00:08:30,704 --> 00:08:36,342
And then it became very different. I went for once or twice a day.

61
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:49,654
Of course I lost a lot of weight, I still haven’t recovered and for 5-6 months it was much better.

62
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,464
– By this diet?
– By this diet.

63
00:08:52,705 --> 00:08:59,264
Today the only thing I don’t eat is milk which I know it caused me terrible diarrheas.

64
00:08:59,532 --> 00:09:06,700
– Immediately?
– Few hours after and honey.

65
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:11,544
When I used to have honey made my bowel like that.

66
00:09:12,064 --> 00:09:25,132
Before this diet I also headache which started from here. It was terrible.

67
00:09:25,384 --> 00:09:31,264
It was too often like once every 1-2 weeks.

68
00:09:31,532 --> 00:09:37,228
Ever since I started with the diet for a few months I didn’t have almost any headache

69
00:09:37,504 --> 00:09:45,484
and now I have only once o month. After the diet improved...

70
00:09:47,224 --> 00:10:01,548
- And now you have it every...
- Once a month or so; normal. Maybe this is important.

71
00:10:01,824 --> 00:10:15,904
When my nose started running for the first time it was after 2 days that suddenly out of the blue I had terrible pain,

72
00:10:16,144 --> 00:10:26,904
for 2 days I simply lied down because I couldn’t even sit and ever since it is like 16 years my nose is running.

73
00:10:27,148 --> 00:10:39,820
Before this it never ran. 2 days there was terrible headache...after this my nose started running.

74
00:10:40,064 --> 00:10:48,504
16 years now.
– But I don’t see it running.

75
00:10:49,292 --> 00:10:55,424
–It’s not so bad.
– Before it was worse?

76
00:10:55,692 --> 00:11:06,424
– Not really, but it’s wet. I know it’s wet.

77
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:23,584
– Do you like the taste of milk?
– No, but the white cheese yes.

78
00:11:23,852 --> 00:11:26,412
– But milk?
– Milk itself not so.

79
00:11:26,664 --> 00:11:39,212
– You never liked pure milk.
– But coffee with milk yes. Pure milk, never.

80
00:11:39,704 --> 00:11:50,220
– How do you react in weather? If it is very warm or cold?
– No problem.

81
00:11:50,464 --> 00:11:57,384
– You can sit under the sun, sunbathing?
– Yes, no problem.

82
00:12:01,464 --> 00:12:13,260
Once I had hernia on the right and it came back again. I made a surgery...

83
00:12:13,504 --> 00:12:17,344
- And it came back.
– Yes.

84
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:26,700
– Do you have any fears?
– When I was young I had fear of heights.

85
00:12:26,944 --> 00:12:33,612
– Now?
– Much less but it’s still there.

86
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:39,624
I wouldn’t voluntarily go to look from a tall building.

87
00:12:39,864 --> 00:12:42,700
In the army I was a paratrooper and I never stood by the door.

88
00:12:42,944 --> 00:12:46,391
I always was like third because I was afraid of the height.

89
00:12:46,664 --> 00:12:48,704
– In the army you were a...

90
00:12:48,972 --> 00:12:52,300
- Paratrooper but I never stood at the door.

91
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,272
There is always someone standing at the door, wait for the green light,

92
00:12:55,372 --> 00:12:58,337
I never stood there, I was always like second, I didn’t want to look down.

93
00:12:58,584 --> 00:13:07,024
– You closed your eyes and jumped.
– They pushed me! They pushed everybody.

94
00:13:12,144 --> 00:13:20,384
– I see the redness around your eyelids. What is this?

95
00:13:20,652 --> 00:13:24,984
Is it usual or because you didn’t sleep last night?
– No, it’s usual.

96
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:29,612
– Do you know if you grind your teeth in the night?

97
00:13:29,864 --> 00:13:36,504
– I don’t think so. Nobody told me. Sometimes it happens but not so frequently.

98
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:45,740
– How do you know sometimes?
– But girl. She wakes me up saying to stop it.

99
00:13:45,984 --> 00:13:51,624
– When was it the last time she did that?

100
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:56,984
– I don’t remember. A few months ago but usually she falls asleep before me.

101
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:03,904
So, she doesn’t know. She’s already sleeping.

102
00:14:04,424 --> 00:14:11,852
– How is your relation with animals? You feel allergic to animals?

103
00:14:12,104 --> 00:14:17,740
– No. A little bit fear of dogs, I don’t know why. For dogs...

104
00:14:17,984 --> 00:14:20,200
- Cats?
– No, no problem.

105
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,348
– You can pet them?
– No problem.

106
00:14:22,624 --> 00:14:30,304
– Are you going to take them in your lap?
– No problem. Dogs...I don’t know.

107
00:14:32,864 --> 00:14:41,548
– In your family was anybody who had tuberculosis?
– I don’t think so.

108
00:14:41,824 --> 00:14:44,108
– You know tuberculosis?
– I am not sure.

109
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,844
– In the lungs..
- No.

110
00:14:46,944 --> 00:15:00,504
– They make a skin test...
- No. I know there is no lung problem.

111
00:15:00,748 --> 00:15:04,864
– Do you get colds easily?
–No.

112
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:10,744
– Do you get any closure of your nose or is it always open and running?

113
00:15:10,988 --> 00:15:13,824
– It is always open, running.

114
00:15:14,064 --> 00:15:16,108
– Your sleep is good?
– Yes.

115
00:15:16,384 --> 00:15:20,124
– You sleep right through the night?
– Yes.

116
00:15:20,224 --> 00:15:26,624
– And you wake up refreshed or unrefreshed?
– Usually refreshed.

117
00:15:26,864 --> 00:15:29,697
– You drink a lot of water?
– Yes.

118
00:15:29,697 --> 00:15:38,657
- You’re a thirsty guy?
– No, I wouldn’t say I am a thirsty guy

119
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:44,024
but sometimes I drink in the heat because I know I have to drink...

120
00:15:44,268 --> 00:15:51,905
- Do you need cold or hot drinks or anything is ok? Anything is ok.

121
00:15:52,182 --> 00:15:53,462
– Yes.

122
00:15:55,504 --> 00:16:06,262
- Concerning the temperature you say you have no problem that means you feel good in heat...

123
00:16:06,504 --> 00:16:07,542
- Heat and cold.

124
00:16:07,784 --> 00:16:12,904
– You can tolerate the cold.
– No problem.

125
00:16:13,665 --> 00:16:21,622
– Do you salivate during sleep? Is there any saliva running through sleep?

126
00:16:21,864 --> 00:16:31,344
Do you understand “saliva”? 
-No. Ah, spit!

127
00:16:35,702 --> 00:16:44,904
It was a period that I had a little bit but there was a period that I had it during the sleep.

128
00:16:45,174 --> 00:16:50,060
Now, no. For that last I don’t know how many years.

129
00:16:50,824 --> 00:16:57,984
– He grinds his teeth. He does not know it. You grind your teeth.

130
00:16:58,252 --> 00:17:00,812
It’s only you don’t know it.

131
00:17:02,092 --> 00:17:07,704
Your dentist has said anything or you go don’t go to the dentist?

132
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:12,064
- I go. Never said anything.

133
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:21,377
– You eat all kinds of food?
– Yes.

134
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:27,504
– You eat meat?
– When the meat has some fat in it you like it?

135
00:17:27,777 --> 00:17:34,669
– The fat by itself no but when it’s combined...

136
00:17:37,504 --> 00:17:47,984
The fat by itself no but when it’s mixed I have no problem.

137
00:17:49,264 --> 00:17:57,464
– How much salt you like?
– Very little.

138
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:05,388
– You’re careful because of your health?
– Yes, I’m careful. Not only for the salt.

139
00:18:05,664 --> 00:18:14,348
– You don’t like it really or you used to like salt and you stopped it when you heard that salt is not good?

140
00:18:14,624 --> 00:18:19,470
– I stopped it when I started the diet a few years ago, with the milk etc.

141
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:24,460
They recommended not to have salt and I took less than I used to eat,

142
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:28,024
like sugar, now I don’t drink sugar.

143
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,372
I got used to it but before I used to have sugar...

144
00:18:31,624 --> 00:18:34,424
- A lot of sugar?
– Not a lot.

145
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:39,544
– Do you know if you have been infected by a venereal disease;

146
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:46,984
gonorrhea, or trichomonas or anything?
– No and I made many tests.

147
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,064
– You have antibiotics before?

148
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:56,704
– Not as far as I can remember. Maybe with the hernia I had some but I don’t remember.

149
00:18:56,972 --> 00:19:07,980
– But you had no infections like bronchitis or pneumonia or you had no influenza.

150
00:19:08,224 --> 00:19:11,052
– Not that I remember.

151
00:19:11,304 --> 00:19:17,184
– Maybe when the nose started I took some stuff, that thing that you put in the nose,

152
00:19:17,452 --> 00:19:20,780
but that was 5 years before the bowel stuff...

153
00:19:21,024 --> 00:19:24,104
- And why did you put this in your nose?

154
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:29,104
– For the running nose because the doctors didn’t know why it was running.

155
00:19:34,442 --> 00:19:39,254
– Sexually how you feel?
– It depends on the bowel.

156
00:19:39,504 --> 00:19:45,142
If it’s a good day it’s good and in a bad day it’s bad. If it is bad I avoid it.

157
00:19:48,082 --> 00:20:00,225
– So actually your life depends on your bowel motion...
- Pretty much.

158
00:20:00,502 --> 00:20:11,254
– Would you say that you are anxious about this? Maybe you think you have cancer?

159
00:20:11,504 --> 00:20:20,705
– Sometimes I think it but after 12 years if nothing happened by now...

160
00:20:20,982 --> 00:20:27,624
- But in the beginning you were thinking?
– Yes, I thought of it.

161
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:47,024
– What I am asking is whether in the past you were very anxious.

162
00:20:47,265 --> 00:20:49,825
“Oh, I have cancer...My bowels are not working.

163
00:20:50,102 --> 00:20:57,505
Most probably I have some cancer that’s why it cannot come out”.

164
00:20:57,783 --> 00:21:04,182
– I was more excited about bowel movement rather than cancer.

165
00:21:04,424 --> 00:21:09,302
Of course it comes to my mind, all the things that can happen,

166
00:21:09,544 --> 00:21:12,374
but I was more worried about the bowel.

167
00:21:12,565 --> 00:21:19,124
I did some many tests and they never found anything including cancer for which they obviously looked for.

168
00:21:19,542 --> 00:21:28,332
During the years I did all the tests that could be done by the doctors.

169
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:37,784
– Do you have special dream, that means a dream that repeats itself?

170
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:57,900
– Usually the come with periods like for a few months a have constant dreaming about something but then it goes.

171
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,500
Something interesting about the dreaming;

172
00:21:59,744 --> 00:22:01,292
sometimes I dream something,

173
00:22:01,544 --> 00:22:13,944
I wake up and months or years after I stand in some place and I say I was here my dream

174
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:20,104
and I can’t explain it but I know for sure I was there.

175
00:22:20,344 --> 00:22:28,300
It’s not accurate, but it’s accurate enough to say I was here, I dreamed about it.

176
00:22:30,344 --> 00:22:43,384
– Do you have any dreams of falling.
– No. Sometimes I feel that I can fly but not very high

177
00:22:43,660 --> 00:23:02,092
like 50m in the air. As if I am able to take off.

178
00:23:02,344 --> 00:23:08,744
– Being able to doing it actually?
– Doing it!

179
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:26,177
–When you have stool your nose runs more than usual?
– No, I cannot say.

180
00:23:26,368 --> 00:23:33,344
When I eat spicy my nose is running terribly.

181
00:23:37,944 --> 00:23:52,024
– You said that you feel tightness in the rectum?
– Also, yes. All the system.

182
00:23:54,337 --> 00:23:58,944
– How can you describe this tightness?

183
00:24:02,697 --> 00:24:08,964
– It’s like everything is trying to pull back.

184
00:24:11,068 --> 00:24:20,228
– Not to let it go.
– Yes. In bad day of the bowel it’s also with the urine.

185
00:24:20,404 --> 00:24:23,264
– Did you have any bad experience in your life?

186
00:24:24,784 --> 00:24:27,344
– I had a very bad experience when my brother died

187
00:24:27,617 --> 00:24:34,264
but it was years after this problem started.

188
00:24:34,508 --> 00:24:40,144
– No, before the problem...
- Before the problem not really.

189
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:46,304
– When did you have your first sexual experience?

190
00:24:46,544 --> 00:25:00,797
– Somewhere between 16 and 17.
– It was with an older woman?

191
00:25:00,944 --> 00:25:12,664
– My age.
– When did you have your last vaccination?

192
00:25:14,464 --> 00:25:25,217
When they give you something to protect you from smallpox, diphtheria...

193
00:25:26,497 --> 00:25:33,144
What year did you go to America?
– 3 years ago.

194
00:25:33,388 --> 00:25:41,757
– Where you vaccinated?
– No. I don’t remember when it was the last time I had any.

195
00:25:42,004 --> 00:25:47,464
– It was in the childhood?
– I think so. In the army we received a few.

196
00:25:47,704 --> 00:25:50,540
– What age you went to the army?
-18.

197
00:25:50,784 --> 00:25:55,144
Just when you go to the army straightaway you get them.

198
00:25:55,384 --> 00:26:02,060
– And when this bowel started?
– In the end of the army after 3.5 years.

199
00:26:02,304 --> 00:26:09,984
I think it’s in the end or right after.

200
00:26:10,252 --> 00:26:18,700
It was somewhere there put I cannot put a finger like I can put with the nose.

201
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:23,052
– The nose what age it was?
-16.

202
00:26:23,304 --> 00:26:29,944
– And what happened, tell me again because I could not hear while I was writing?

203
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:36,764
– Suddenly for 2 days I had a terrible headache that was focused here

204
00:26:36,864 --> 00:26:43,264
and I had to lie down for 2 days because I couldn’t even sit.

205
00:26:43,532 --> 00:26:50,700
– But were you exposed to some draft or cold before this?

206
00:26:50,944 --> 00:26:54,540
– Not really, it was summer, it was August.

207
00:26:55,052 --> 00:27:10,664
I week before this I believe it was the summer camp, kibbutz, in a small city.

208
00:27:10,904 --> 00:27:14,252
– You lived with your parents, not in the kibbutz?

209
00:27:14,404 --> 00:27:20,552
– No the kibbutz was just for 2 weeks, it’s a camp, with my parents.

210
00:27:20,652 --> 00:27:27,544
– And you had how many children?
– I have one sister and one brother.

211
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:32,824
– What did your brother die of?
– Car accident.

212
00:27:35,384 --> 00:27:44,864
– You run fast with the cars?
- I’m a careful driver.

213
00:27:49,017 --> 00:27:55,344
– This running nose is becoming worse if you get exposed to cold?

214
00:27:55,617 --> 00:28:03,297
– Yes, a little bit. It’s getting worse.

215
00:28:03,788 --> 00:28:10,188
But maybe because of the sun it’s dried a little bit.

216
00:28:10,977 --> 00:28:17,104
– If you described your character what would you say about your self?

217
00:28:17,377 --> 00:28:36,304
– I believe I’m honest. I think I am smart. I like to laugh a lot. Joke.

218
00:28:40,664 --> 00:28:53,217
I think I’m friendly. My girlfriend claims that I am stubborn.

219
00:28:53,464 --> 00:29:01,388
But she says it’s about all Israelis so I cannot differ my self from the population.

220
00:29:01,664 --> 00:29:06,508
But I think she is right a little bit, I’m a little bit stubborn.

221
00:29:07,024 --> 00:29:11,904
- If I see the way you insisted coming here...

222
00:29:12,144 --> 00:29:17,304
- If I think I need to do something I’ll do it.

223
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:21,144
Even if it is to come to Alonissos for 2 hours,

224
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:29,505
I came a few days in advance so I will not miss anything, I had to plan.

225
00:29:29,782 --> 00:29:36,182
And I am going to stay a few more days so if there is going to be help I’m not going to be exposed to...

226
00:29:36,324 --> 00:29:41,444
- You’re going to stay here?
– For 4 days for sure.

227
00:29:43,144 --> 00:29:51,265
– Here in the report I get it says you never get excited for anything. Is that true?

228
00:29:51,542 --> 00:30:06,348
– Pretty much. There are very few things. It happens rarely but it happens.

229
00:30:09,888 --> 00:30:13,725
– How is your concentration?

230
00:30:14,582 --> 00:30:22,262
– Not so good but the memory is very good. The concentration depends.

231
00:30:22,504 --> 00:30:24,054
If something is interesting I will be concentrated,

232
00:30:24,304 --> 00:30:27,624
if something doesn’t interest me although I know I have to focus...

233
00:30:32,302 --> 00:30:42,742
When I was young the concentration was good. I don’t know why now it isn’t.

234
00:30:47,185 --> 00:30:58,337
– You never have any vertigo, dizziness?
– Not really. I had a few times.

235
00:30:58,584 --> 00:31:08,342
– Only if you look from a very high place you get some dizziness or fear?

236
00:31:08,854 --> 00:31:18,305
– It’s a fear but it’s also something like...
- Turning, vertigo?

237
00:31:18,582 --> 00:31:25,224
– Yes. A little bit.
– You have a fear you may jump or the height may pull you?

238
00:31:25,494 --> 00:31:28,304
– No. I know I’m not gonna jump!

239
00:31:34,945 --> 00:31:40,065
- But drawn down?
– Yes.

240
00:31:40,242 --> 00:31:50,625
– Do you ever think something that will happen and you promote your thinking and your imagination

241
00:31:50,902 --> 00:31:59,344
for instance you go downstairs in a very high building and you run down and at a certain moment

242
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:08,545
you think what will happen if I just fall down and go down the stairs until I’m crashed?

243
00:32:08,822 --> 00:32:23,664
– No. Never had these fears.
– You never have an impulse to do some dangerous things;

244
00:32:23,905 --> 00:32:29,025
putting your hand in the socket testing?
– No.

245
00:32:35,425 --> 00:32:43,105
– None of these remedies except of Pod. helped you.

246
00:32:57,704 --> 00:33:04,865
– Just the bowel and just for the bowel not for the nose.

247
00:33:09,744 --> 00:33:16,385
– If you eat honey will you have diarrhea?

248
00:33:16,904 --> 00:33:31,745
– It’s the bowel is like tightened and pushed.

249
00:33:32,264 --> 00:33:38,934
It’s a little bit different from milk. The milk is more diarrhea.

250
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:43,784
– Do you have a lot of gas?
– Yes.

251
00:33:44,054 --> 00:34:03,504
– Very offensive or not?
– Yes, a little bit offensive odor.

252
00:34:08,624 --> 00:34:17,064
– Find feeling of tightness in the rectum or in the abdomen.

253
00:34:25,014 --> 00:34:28,854
Do you think you have said everything?

254
00:34:29,104 --> 00:34:45,494
Tell me the desire to urinate is frequent but not really like you urinate,

255
00:34:45,744 --> 00:34:48,304
you wait there, it stops, you wait there,

256
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:54,945
it starts again and you wait for a while and it starts again and... interrupted urination.

257
00:34:55,122 --> 00:35:00,604
– It’s more like I urinate I’m moving with something...

258
00:35:00,704 --> 00:35:09,664
- And then it starts again.
– How much sleep do you need? A lot?

259
00:35:10,177 --> 00:35:16,064
– 6-7 hours. When I started the diet I used to sleep 4-5 hours.

260
00:35:16,304 --> 00:35:20,664
When I started the diet I was very energetic.

261
00:35:21,184 --> 00:35:25,784
When I started the diet avoiding milk, honey, bread

262
00:35:26,028 --> 00:35:30,384
I was very energetic I could sleep only 4-5 hours,

263
00:35:32,404 --> 00:35:41,664
lot of sex, made up for previous years and next years!

264
00:35:44,464 --> 00:35:52,908
– Do you know if your parents have any disease?

265
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:58,304
– They don’t tell. My father has one kidney taken out.

266
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:09,304
He also has to go twice a day in the bathroom.

267
00:36:09,548 --> 00:36:20,577
He is going twice a day and he’s happy.
– Your mother?

268
00:36:21,068 --> 00:36:33,377
– She has cholesterol and she is going to the bathroom once every 2-3 days.

269
00:36:41,057 --> 00:36:52,064
– If you are in a room where it is stuffy, they smoke does it affect you?

270
00:36:52,577 --> 00:37:03,007
– I don’t like the smoke. It bothers me a little bit. I don’t like when people smoke next to me.

271
00:37:03,108 --> 00:37:08,844
– But you will be the first one to go open the window? Or it’s not so bad?

272
00:37:09,217 --> 00:37:17,302
– If I can and it won’t be a rude thing in someone else’s place I will probably do that.

273
00:37:17,544 --> 00:37:25,985
– Do you cry easily?
– No. Not at all.

274
00:37:26,504 --> 00:37:31,105
– Never?
-When my brother died I cried.

275
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:43,144
Every year when we go to the annual I can’t help it. It’s like once a year.

276
00:37:46,465 --> 00:37:57,494
And when I remember him I feel like tears are coming.

277
00:38:01,584 --> 00:38:10,017
– The stool sometimes tries to go out and then backs again?
– No.

278
00:38:10,264 --> 00:38:16,908
– Once it’s out, a little piece is out and then it stops.

279
00:38:17,424 --> 00:38:21,784
– When it’s out, it’s out it doesn’t go back.

280
00:38:22,028 --> 00:38:34,828
– And when it’s out the rectum closes and no more urge or there is urge but it doesn’t come out?

281
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:43,388
– The second. I feel that I still have and it doesn’t go out.

282
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:51,468
– No power to expel it.
– I feel it’s inside but I t doesn’t go out.

283
00:38:52,748 --> 00:39:07,344
– Alright. I want to give you some more information that was sent with his case from America

284
00:39:07,617 --> 00:39:20,144
about this nice man that we saw and in the report it says that he is a good guy.

285
00:39:22,188 --> 00:39:53,844
Feels bad if he hurts someone. He never has criminal thoughts.

286
00:39:53,944 --> 00:40:01,377
It seems this is a standard question in America now.

287
00:40:02,904 --> 00:40:08,784
I never thought of asking this question so far!

288
00:40:09,057 --> 00:40:25,974
But it becomes a popular question for America and continues and he says it’s hard for him to shout

289
00:40:28,534 --> 00:40:43,104
and also not very aggressive. Also has many friends but deep feelings keeps to himself.

290
00:40:46,124 --> 00:40:55,384
Can lose his concentration as he said, never gets excited for anything, it’s underlined here 3 times.

291
00:40:55,628 --> 00:41:01,024
We did not really get this impression from him.

292
00:41:03,944 --> 00:41:07,424
Good childhood, good parents.

293
00:41:08,184 --> 00:41:15,344
These were things we did not discuss and the case is very difficult.

294
00:41:15,517 --> 00:41:32,257
I can tell you that though the pathology is not important, is not serious,

295
00:41:32,504 --> 00:41:40,184
yet affects his life quite dramatically and he is not a happy man.

296
00:41:40,428 --> 00:41:51,704
He could have been much happier. Why his case is not clear, I am not sure.

297
00:41:55,024 --> 00:41:59,384
It was unclear from the beginning.

298
00:42:01,697 --> 00:42:07,308
Either there is a very small remedy which we don’t perceive

299
00:42:07,584 --> 00:42:13,984
or maybe we have not hit the remedy because he took a lot of remedies as you saw already.

300
00:42:14,497 --> 00:42:20,624
Or maybe because he took so many remedies the case is not very clear.

301
00:42:20,897 --> 00:42:25,228
So we can discuss his case.

302
00:42:25,504 --> 00:42:44,944
I would like first to show you a repertorization with all the information that Phil was feeding the computer

303
00:42:45,217 --> 00:42:49,548
which I did not like and I read it.

304
00:42:50,828 --> 00:43:00,064
He put; constant discharge, watery discharge, diarrhea after milk, fear of dogs,

305
00:43:00,577 --> 00:43:08,504
inflammation of the margin of lids, copious dripping, pain on the rooth of nose,

306
00:43:08,648 --> 00:43:18,028
abdominal hernia inguinal, insufficient stool, constriction of rectum, frequent urging,

307
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:28,024
stool after urging, bladder urination incomplete and unsatisfactory,

308
00:43:28,544 --> 00:43:35,704
bladder urination interrupted, dreams clairvoyant, dreams of flying,

309
00:43:35,948 --> 00:43:52,344
internal constriction, spices aggaravate, tobacco aversion, smell of tobacco.

310
00:43:57,464 --> 00:44:11,304
If you put all that the computer shows this. I did not like the result.

311
00:44:11,824 --> 00:44:24,502
Show me the result. Phos. and Nat-ar.

312
00:44:25,014 --> 00:44:32,182
Which have come up as you see both these remedies were given to him.

313
00:44:32,424 --> 00:44:40,624
Sulph., Bell., Nux-v.,  was given. Staph. I think was given.

314
00:44:40,865 --> 00:44:48,054
No? Yes. Nit-ac. No.

315
00:44:48,304 --> 00:44:57,264
Anyhow most of these remedies were given and in the beginning I had written down a remedy

316
00:44:57,505 --> 00:45:04,694
which I thought it would be and when I looked in the computer I did not see at all this remedy.

317
00:45:05,704 --> 00:45:12,704
So I ask him to do a different repertorization.

318
00:45:17,784 --> 00:45:25,217
What I want to say is that in repertorization

319
00:45:25,464 --> 00:45:40,824
in order to get some ideas you have to put what are the most clear symptoms if you have such and look through.

320
00:45:41,068 --> 00:45:46,188
You put 4-5 symptoms, you look, you put 1 more, you look, you put another, you look.

321
00:45:46,464 --> 00:45:57,984
To see where is the best remedy. Where comes in each step the best remedy.

322
00:46:06,324 --> 00:46:14,774
Has anybody any idea? No idea.

323
00:46:15,024 --> 00:46:22,704
The whole class is stunned by his case!

324
00:46:27,062 --> 00:46:36,264
– I was thinking about Thuja. Mainly because of the vaccination.

325
00:46:36,784 --> 00:46:42,564
He is not sure how it was his causative agent.

326
00:46:42,664 --> 00:46:57,264
– The only problem with Thuja is that it creates it a dryness of the mucus membranes which is very aggravating.

327
00:46:57,782 --> 00:47:01,622
They cannot sleep because of dryness. He has the opposite.

328
00:47:01,864 --> 00:47:07,254
This cannot exclude but ok, Thuja is a possibility.

329
00:47:07,504 --> 00:47:18,504
We would like to find a remedy that must have both this problem in the abdomen,

330
00:47:18,774 --> 00:47:25,942
the insufficient stool that doesn’t come out and the constant catarrh.

331
00:47:26,454 --> 00:47:36,694
These are 2 main things which we have to couple with certain keynotes and with his character.

332
00:47:36,944 --> 00:47:48,982
So the best remedy will be a remedy that will have his pathology plus some keynotes plus his character.

333
00:47:52,545 --> 00:48:00,824
– Nat-c. because much diarrhea, aggravation and the type of the insufficient stool,

334
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:08,780
he has to go very frequently and urination is incomplete he has to go very frequently to empty down his bladder.

335
00:48:09,024 --> 00:48:14,904
These are 3 strong symptoms I find of Nat-c.
– Very good.

336
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:36,172
– I thought maybe Mag-m.
– Also Mag-m. is a good prescription because of the sensitivity to milk.

337
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:44,864
But which is the remedy which both sensitivity to milk and sensitivity to honey.

338
00:48:45,624 --> 00:48:59,464
Nat-c. So therefore I ask him, put the second repertorization, show me the symptoms.

339
00:48:59,704 --> 00:49:08,172
I stayed for a while and I told him to the constant discharge, the watery discharge,

340
00:49:08,424 --> 00:49:17,624
the diarrhea from milk, the grinding of the teeth during sleep, red lips edges,

341
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:28,384
constipation insufficient, aversion milk, constriction of rectum, pain root of nose extending to forehead.

342
00:49:28,652 --> 00:49:39,384
That’s it. So, we have a possibility that the remedy is Nat-c.

343
00:49:45,664 --> 00:49:58,464
We have to investigate whether this remedy fits his personality. What is Nat-c. personality?

344
00:50:00,304 --> 00:50:04,344
You did not hear the Materia Medica, you don’t know the personality.

345
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:14,344
Nat-c. personalities are low-key people who like to help others.

346
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:24,020
They can even sacrifice their own pleasure for other’s.

347
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:40,972
They are people who will be sensitive and considerate of others but Nat-c. has a peculiar...

348
00:50:41,224 --> 00:50:47,624
I did not put the aggravation from honey, just put it.

349
00:50:47,864 --> 00:50:56,824
If you put it will become even stronger but it has in its character I didn’t to ask him inside,

350
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:02,984
Nat-c. has something I will ask you now.

351
00:51:03,224 --> 00:51:12,184
He has aversion to certain persons. You don’t like certain persons.

352
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:19,104
For one reason or another you don’t like some persons.

353
00:51:19,372 --> 00:51:25,772
If this person appears, you leave. Do you have such thing in your life?

354
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:31,904
– It’s kind of jealous? Yes.

355
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:38,572
– Don’t say yes because I ask! This is very bad what I am doing now!

356
00:51:42,664 --> 00:51:47,532
Maybe because we want some more confirmation.

357
00:51:47,784 --> 00:52:03,904
What I am asking is whether you have certain strong aversion to certain people you don’t know why.

358
00:52:04,424 --> 00:52:09,782
You don’t know why but if my mother-in-law comes I don’t like.

359
00:52:09,924 --> 00:52:23,344
This happens often, don’t take this example. When the friend of my cousin comes I don’t like him.

360
00:52:23,585 --> 00:52:26,664
So you don’t like him so much that you have to leave the room.

361
00:52:27,184 --> 00:52:31,024
– No that much that I have to leave the room

362
00:52:31,265 --> 00:52:36,385
but I can see there are people who I don’t like but not like you say.

363
00:52:37,942 --> 00:52:41,505
It’s not I cannot say why I don’t like them.

364
00:52:41,782 --> 00:52:45,864
Usually I see someone and from the look I will say I don’t like him.

365
00:52:46,134 --> 00:52:59,825
But I know why I don’t like him.
- This is not confirmed.

366
00:53:00,464 --> 00:53:16,854
Another question that I would like to ask is if this is a longstanding case of Nat-c.

367
00:53:17,104 --> 00:53:29,654
we could have a sensitivity to the sun and he could relate one case at least where he had a sunstroke.

368
00:53:29,904 --> 00:53:36,545
Did you ever have a sunstroke? You stayed in the sun and you had headache?

369
00:53:37,825 --> 00:53:49,864
Was this case of headache because you were lying in the beach for 2 hours in the sun?

370
00:53:50,134 --> 00:53:56,022
– I don’t think so.
– Never had any problems with the sun.

371
00:53:56,534 --> 00:54:14,704
– Not really.
– You didn’t eat pork.

372
00:54:14,945 --> 00:54:19,624
– I try to avoid pork because of tradition.

373
00:54:19,865 --> 00:54:24,894
– Otherwise you like it.
– I tried.

374
00:54:29,025 --> 00:54:36,864
– There is no sensitivity to the sun and there is no aversion to certain people.

375
00:54:37,384 --> 00:54:58,624
Show me. Kali-c. is an idea. Show me why.

376
00:54:58,892 --> 00:55:04,865
Because he has diarrhea from milk, grinding teeth, red lids,

377
00:55:05,142 --> 00:55:09,985
constipation insufficient, aversion milk and constriction in the rectum.

378
00:55:10,262 --> 00:55:23,852
Kali-c. And show me the next remedy. Which was, forget the Calc... Mag-m.

379
00:55:24,104 --> 00:55:35,624
Discharge constant, watery, diarrhea, constipation... Aversion to milk.\

380
00:55:36,652 --> 00:55:50,464
His character fits mostly with the description of Nat-c. and Mag-c., Mag-m.

381
00:55:50,632 --> 00:55:57,624
The magnesias are peaceful people are peaceful people they are not aggressive, they are seeking peace.

382
00:55:57,901 --> 00:56:02,252
Are you like this? If somebody fights you try to make peace?

383
00:56:03,784 --> 00:56:11,464
– Yes. Unless I want him to be beaten.

384
00:56:12,484 --> 00:56:18,944
– In some cases is which there is an Arab…?

385
00:56:19,212 --> 00:56:28,640
– No. It’s not nationalistic. But if he deserves it yes, absolutely.

386
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:37,900
Even I punch him too.
– He’s healthy!

387
00:56:38,412 --> 00:56:46,344
In these levels why we cannot get symptomatology... They’re quite healthy.

388
00:56:46,984 --> 00:56:57,100
Apart from the fear of heights and a little fear of dogs we cannot get symptomatology on mental and emotional.

389
00:56:57,344 --> 00:57:01,004
– I would like to ask a question to the patient

390
00:57:01,104 --> 00:57:07,254
because he said that his bowel problems started at the end of the army.

391
00:57:07,504 --> 00:57:15,532
And as far as I know the army in Israel is 2 or 3 years and it’s very tough I imagine,

392
00:57:15,784 --> 00:57:22,700
How did that influence him? What did that do to you to be in the army for 3 years.

393
00:57:23,324 --> 00:57:25,068
- First, I had to stay 4 years in the army,

394
00:57:25,344 --> 00:57:35,584
one more year and the last year was the easiest for me because I had the hernia surgery

395
00:57:36,097 --> 00:57:42,744
and then I had to leave the paratrooper because it was in a base not far from home.

396
00:57:42,988 --> 00:57:46,828
This was the quite time in the army.

397
00:57:47,104 --> 00:57:52,737
And the bowel problem started after so I can’t say it’s because of the army.

398
00:57:52,984 --> 00:57:57,344
This was the easy part, the last year.

399
00:57:58,157 --> 00:58:07,308
I think the main pathology depends on his allergic complaints

400
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:14,224
because the problems with the stooling are totally allergic complaints.

401
00:58:14,497 --> 00:58:21,388
If he changes his food the symptom diminish and you can imagine

402
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:28,577
that if he had complete test of the food and would change the food totally

403
00:58:28,824 --> 00:58:33,184
he wouldn’t have complaints with his rectum and stooling.

404
00:58:33,424 --> 00:58:43,424
These complaints he had even before he went to the army but it increased...

405
00:58:43,564 --> 00:58:48,694
- No, the complaints started a year after the army.

406
00:58:48,844 --> 00:58:58,145
– No. The allergic complaints he had even when he was 16, and the military...

407
00:58:58,664 --> 00:59:04,545
- Wait. You call allergic complaint the running of nose?
– Yes.

408
00:59:05,064 --> 00:59:07,382
– The running of nose, most probably,

409
00:59:07,524 --> 00:59:16,065
was an inflammation of the frontal sinuses which created the severe pain here

410
00:59:16,342 --> 00:59:25,025
and when they were opened and then there is a catarrh of the frontal sinuses most probably...

411
00:59:25,302 --> 00:59:29,904
But you can take is as allergic. Continue.

412
00:59:30,145 --> 00:59:33,985
– In my opinion, I have many patients with these problems.

413
00:59:34,262 --> 00:59:39,624
It depends on the allergic reaction of the intestines.

414
00:59:39,894 --> 00:59:45,405
This makes at least also the chronic sinusitis and these problems.

415
00:59:45,505 --> 00:59:52,944
So if you diminish the food he will not stand then the complaints will diminish

416
00:59:53,185 --> 01:00:00,374
and then you are in a position to find the correct remedy much easier.

417
01:00:01,384 --> 01:00:08,054
– I am not sure because how is that?

418
01:00:08,304 --> 01:00:15,734
An Ars. case who is aggravated by cold, you put him in a warm room and feels comfortable.

419
01:00:15,984 --> 01:00:19,062
Do you think you will find it easier? No.

420
01:00:19,304 --> 01:00:30,824
Therefore actually you have to allow the food that stimulates aggressively to be there

421
01:00:31,344 --> 01:00:36,424
so the organism will give a full range of symptoms.

422
01:00:36,664 --> 01:00:44,584
Exactly when he avoids certain type of food there is pause of the symptoms.

423
01:00:44,854 --> 01:00:53,025
You will find no symptoms at all because it is a matter of digestion.

424
01:00:53,544 --> 01:00:58,664
The digestive system is very affected.

425
01:01:01,494 --> 01:01:09,904
Both Nat-c. and Mag-m. are affecting the digestive system.

426
01:01:10,177 --> 01:01:19,137
Nat-c. affects the digestive system from the stomach downwards.

427
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:28,344
Mag-m. affects it from the liver downwards.

428
01:01:28,864 --> 01:01:50,104
So this case of this nice man is a case where definitely there is a problem in digestive system.

429
01:01:51,137 --> 01:02:00,864
And the moment you reduce his allergens he has no problems.

430
01:02:01,104 --> 01:02:06,744
But the problem to make his able to eat this kind of foods without problems

431
01:02:06,988 --> 01:02:18,784
and even if you apply now this diet strictly you will get rid of symptoms?

432
01:02:19,297 --> 01:02:23,628
- Maybe it will be better because of fewer carbohydrates.

433
01:02:23,904 --> 01:02:28,057
– Better but now completely eliminated.

434
01:02:28,204 --> 01:02:32,224
–Even when I stopped it right away it was more symptomatic things.

435
01:02:32,365 --> 01:02:38,865
I was relieved a little bit but I felt it’s not like when I had the Pod.

436
01:02:39,065 --> 01:02:48,097
The Pod. made me keep on and keep on trying.

437
01:02:48,344 --> 01:02:58,064
– I would like to ask the patient I have not understood what is going on when you are having stool.

438
01:02:58,337 --> 01:03:06,264
Can you start having stool and then it stops and you get the constriction or what?

439
01:03:06,409 --> 01:03:15,124
What is happening?
– It simply doesn’t leave me completely. I am not empty I cannot get empty.

440
01:03:15,469 --> 01:03:21,624
– So you can have some stool?
– Yes. I have 6-7 times min.

441
01:03:21,868 --> 01:03:32,624
– And then you have a constriction? Tightness?
– I got tightness all the time.

442
01:03:35,357 --> 01:03:39,852
– George I would like to ask you about a rubric if you can use it.

443
01:03:40,104 --> 01:03:46,252
It’s rectum; constriction, preventing stool.

444
01:03:46,504 --> 01:03:52,140
– This is too dramatic for him but you can use it.

445
01:03:52,384 --> 01:03:59,052
Constriction, rectum, closure. Show preventing stool.

446
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:38,464
Berb. Nit-ac. Again Nit-ac. Put this twice. Nit-ac.

447
01:04:38,984 --> 01:04:46,144
There is a possibility but his character is not like this.

448
01:04:46,312 --> 01:04:52,300
He doesn’t have any fissures. He will not show great anxiety.

449
01:04:52,544 --> 01:04:58,700
Maybe he hides his anxiety but I tried to find out how much his anxiety was

450
01:04:59,212 --> 01:05:03,544
and his anxiety about health is not very high.

451
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:07,660
Your anxiety about your health?

452
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:16,104
You consider it as very high, high, medium or low?

453
01:05:16,344 --> 01:05:18,904
– As far as the bowel movement it’s very high.

454
01:05:26,584 --> 01:05:30,184
It drives me crazy for the last 12 years.

455
01:05:33,504 --> 01:05:42,824
– When you wake up in the morning you said you feel refreshed?
– Yes.

456
01:05:45,904 --> 01:05:50,262
– The fat in the meat you can eat a little bit.

457
01:05:50,504 --> 01:05:55,105
– Not but itself. I don’t like it by itself.

458
01:05:55,382 --> 01:06:09,974
– The real Nit-ac. takes the fat from the others and eats it. Contradictory symptoms.

459
01:06:10,124 --> 01:06:26,104
– He said that he had cramps from honey and he is planning his things in advance and his fear of height and falling.

460
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:29,704
So, I thought of Arg-n.

461
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:42,504
– Possibility of Arg-n. The stool is formed or unformed?

462
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:46,454
– Unformed. It’s small pieces actually.

463
01:06:46,704 --> 01:06:49,505
– And soft?
– Yes.

464
01:06:49,782 --> 01:06:52,854
– Always soft?
– Yes.

465
01:06:53,345 --> 01:07:11,542
– So it’s not well digested. Have you put stool small and soft?

466
01:07:11,784 --> 01:07:47,624
And underline it thrice. Show me Nat-c. why. 9 out of 13.

467
01:07:52,502 --> 01:08:00,944
Take out honey aggravation.

468
01:08:01,974 --> 01:08:12,705
My problem with Nat-c. is that his complaints are not in the stomach.

469
01:08:12,982 --> 01:08:26,785
They’re after the stomach. Otherwise his character looks quite a lot like Nat-c. from what he says.

470
01:08:27,304 --> 01:08:37,544
We can put frequent urination because it is not interrupted urination.

471
01:08:37,814 --> 01:08:42,422
He doesn’t stay and goes, stops...

472
01:08:42,934 --> 01:08:49,334
He goes out around and after 10 minutes he goes back. That’s the idea.

473
01:08:49,825 --> 01:08:57,782
Interrupted urination. Frequent urination too much.

474
01:08:58,024 --> 01:09:16,705
Do we have any ‘nervous bladder’?

475
01:09:25,265 --> 01:09:48,344
Thuja. Who said Thuja? He said he found it.

476
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:51,592
Anybody has any better idea?

477
01:09:51,944 --> 01:09:58,344
– I can’t understand why you rejected Phos. Phos. is very outstanding in repertorization.

478
01:09:58,584 --> 01:10:04,492
He has Phos. fears, Phos.-like personality, Phos. aversions.

479
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:13,944
Why have you rejected Phos.?
– This is not Phos. personality.

480
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:17,544
It’s an Israeli personality.

481
01:10:19,752 --> 01:10:28,544
All the Israelis when you bring them in they will give straightforward answers and they will tell you everything.

482
01:10:28,812 --> 01:10:30,584
They have good communication.

483
01:10:31,104 --> 01:10:42,280
Because they have not been especially people of Israel themselves,

484
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:46,704
not the American Jews or the other Jews who have a good life,

485
01:10:46,945 --> 01:10:50,024
they have lived difficult periods of life.

486
01:10:50,294 --> 01:10:55,414
The survival instinct is still there, they have not overcome it totally.

487
01:10:55,664 --> 01:11:07,944
Emotionally, they enjoy quite a lot. And their spiritual [sphere] is further away.

488
01:11:08,214 --> 01:11:13,334
That’s why you see they’re balanced in their mental emotional level.

489
01:11:13,584 --> 01:11:18,304
The Israelis are quite balanced, quite like him.

490
01:11:18,544 --> 01:11:23,148
So, don’t be misled to think he is over-communicative.

491
01:11:23,324 --> 01:11:31,344
Actually when he was asked he said he has a lot of friends but my deeper feelings, I keep them for myself.

492
01:11:31,864 --> 01:11:38,017
Also there is no anxiety, there are no the typical fears of Phos.,

493
01:11:38,264 --> 01:11:41,824
there isn’t the anxiety about others,

494
01:11:42,092 --> 01:11:59,500
which is very strong and other keynotes like desire for ice cream, salt are missing.

495
01:12:00,504 --> 01:12:05,265
– I have the symptoms you asked about the nervous bladder.

496
01:12:05,537 --> 01:12:22,424
There’s one urination, frequent, nervous origin and there is one only Cub.

497
01:12:22,668 --> 01:12:26,185
And there is another one, I’m not sure if it’s nervous...

498
01:12:26,285 --> 01:12:35,864
- Find Cub. In M.M.
– Urination, busily occupied, must run and pass little urine.

499
01:12:36,108 --> 01:12:54,544
3 remedies; Calc., Kali-c. and Calc-iod.

500
01:12:57,868 --> 01:13:06,584
– Is that possible to be Kali-c.? We just missed the issue altogether.

501
01:13:07,104 --> 01:13:13,142
Mucous membranes generally, but especially that of the urinary tract, are chiefly affected by this remedy.

502
01:13:13,384 --> 01:13:21,584
Frequent urination of a nervous origin. Urethritis.

503
01:13:21,825 --> 01:13:35,905
Cattarh of nose, throat with fetid odor and expectoration. Mucus increased.

504
01:13:36,182 --> 01:13:42,064
From posterior nares. Rawness of throat and hoarseness.

505
01:13:42,305 --> 01:13:55,624
Cucurbita; Copaiva; Piper meth; Sandal. Cub. from which author is this? Boericke.

506
01:13:56,144 --> 01:14:23,544
Beasty extravagances... It’s terrible remedy!

507
01:14:27,904 --> 01:14:34,934
Diarrhea with borborigmus, flatulence and involuntary stool, like yellow diarrhea,

508
01:14:35,184 --> 01:14:41,334
constipation often lasting over 8 days.

509
01:14:41,825 --> 01:14:49,264
Scanty but frequent dysenteric stools with colic and tenesmus.

510
01:14:49,505 --> 01:15:00,784
My God! This remedy fits his physical symptomatology.

511
01:15:01,025 --> 01:15:09,224
The fact that it doesn’t fit his mental symptomatology it doesn’t mean anything

512
01:15:09,494 --> 01:15:15,105
because as I said he is normal mentally and emotionally.

513
01:15:15,624 --> 01:15:30,984
You don’t find much disturbance. Cub. seems to fit his irritable bladder and irritable colon.

514
01:15:31,254 --> 01:15:34,824
And the catarrh of the nose.

515
01:15:36,624 --> 01:15:47,894
Discharge from the nose of crusty, green and yellow matter with discharge of mucus sometimes thin, sometimes thick.

516
01:15:48,144 --> 01:15:52,502
Burning in the throat. Stuffed up. Obstinate stoppage of nose...

517
01:16:01,185 --> 01:16:06,824
Very unpleasant dryness. Fullness and pulsation.

518
01:16:07,344 --> 01:16:15,265
Coryza with discharge of mucus.

519
01:16:18,664 --> 01:16:24,744
– There is one more symptom, when he said during the history that he doesn’t like fat in general.

520
01:16:24,914 --> 01:16:26,657
If it is only fat he doesn’t take it.

521
01:16:26,904 --> 01:16:32,024
And there is one more rubric in the repertory rectum, feces, remain in, as if.

522
01:16:32,268 --> 01:16:42,017
It has only Nat-c. Rectum, feces, remain in, as if.

523
01:16:43,297 --> 01:16:48,908
Because that why he keeps on going frequently to the toilet to pass.

524
01:16:49,185 --> 01:16:52,748
Because of this sensation that something is remaining.

525
01:16:53,024 --> 01:16:58,144
Because you asked him in the history if he likes fat.

526
01:16:58,384 --> 01:17:01,217
And he said simply, plain fat I don’t like.

527
01:17:01,364 --> 01:17:07,344
But if it is with something then I don’t mind. But plain fat he has an aversion and also has Nat-c.

528
01:17:09,664 --> 01:17:17,068
– This is as if feces remain. Ask him about that.

529
01:17:17,344 --> 01:17:26,817
If this is the case. The symptom is like this;

530
01:17:27,064 --> 01:17:33,708
You have stool and you feel the stool has remained in the rectum.

531
01:17:34,224 --> 01:17:45,584
– Yes in the colon.
– Show me this rubric.

532
01:18:03,434 --> 01:18:07,724
– I’ve got a question. How is it if he is lying back?

533
01:18:07,824 --> 01:18:12,008
Is it possible to pass the stool? I am thinking of Med.

534
01:18:12,108 --> 01:18:22,624
– If you lie back the stool passes more easily?
– I don’t know.

535
01:18:26,977 --> 01:18:39,264
– So we have Cub., Thuja, Nat-c. Mag-m., Pod.

536
01:18:40,024 --> 01:18:49,504
Do you remember how many times they gave you Pod. in the beginning, after this week?

537
01:18:50,017 --> 01:18:59,984
– They gave me the first time Pod.,

538
01:19:00,257 --> 01:19:12,024
then 3 weeks after I took another remedy and then another remedy and then again Pod. Twice.

539
01:19:12,544 --> 01:19:18,668
–The second did nothing.
– Nothing.

540
01:19:19,184 --> 01:19:27,384
– This is a question because if he says the only remedy that touched my case was Pod.

541
01:19:27,628 --> 01:19:31,984
there is in your considerations sure be Pod.

542
01:19:32,257 --> 01:19:38,024
But is Pod. a correct prescription at this moment?

543
01:19:38,294 --> 01:19:50,582
And what might be the right sequence of remedies that he has to take in order to solve this case?

544
01:19:50,867 --> 01:20:01,377
Is starting first with Nat-c., Mag-m., Cub., Thuja, Nit-ac.

545
01:20:01,624 --> 01:20:09,157
How’s Agar.?

546
01:20:24,708 --> 01:20:41,824
Sometimes the anxiety hidden and I don’t know how much is really his anxiety about this whole issue.

547
01:20:46,944 --> 01:20:52,064
What is the first remedy? That’s the problem.

548
01:20:52,205 --> 01:21:00,748
If we just hit the first remedy then the second will almost cure him.

549
01:21:00,924 --> 01:21:21,504
Cub. You never drank milk in your life.
– I didn’t like plain milk, never.

550
01:21:21,744 --> 01:21:29,424
– The stool is always soft is a matter of bad digestion there is no question of that,

551
01:21:29,697 --> 01:21:35,308
the liver is not functioning properly.

552
01:21:38,904 --> 01:21:48,624
Soft, is not diarrhea, is unformed stool which means the digestion has not been completed.

553
01:21:49,388 --> 01:21:58,864
There is no undigested food. Real pieces of undigested food in the stool.

554
01:21:59,384 --> 01:22:08,588
– Sometimes corn, I can see it but not anything else.

555
01:22:08,764 --> 01:22:13,708
– If you eat corn, you may see piece of corn.

556
01:22:17,864 --> 01:22:33,944
–Tomatoes?
– No. Sesame, I can see also sometimes.

557
01:22:34,977 --> 01:22:45,708
– You can see some undigested pieces.

558
01:22:49,548 --> 01:22:56,225
– Do we have any time modalities, better or worse during a period of time in the day?

559
01:22:56,502 --> 01:23:03,664
– Usually in the morning it’s more severe.

560
01:23:04,182 --> 01:23:11,862
– But in the morning you feel ok?
– Yes.

561
01:23:12,104 --> 01:23:17,494
– You wake up and you are refreshed and you can work.

562
01:23:17,744 --> 01:23:24,904
– I work, I can do anything. I just have to put in mind this.

563
01:23:29,264 --> 01:23:38,017
– Show me Kali-m. Allen in stool.

564
01:23:39,024 --> 01:23:43,137
After fatty food pastry...

565
01:23:45,424 --> 01:24:03,617
Stool dry, constipation... Sluggish liver.

566
01:24:04,384 --> 01:24:19,212
Constant pains in rectum, dysentery... Urinary organs?

567
01:24:35,064 --> 01:24:42,892
See Kal-m. has a particular preoccupation with bowels.

568
01:24:43,144 --> 01:24:53,132
Even if they have a good bowel motion they feel this is not satisfactory, this is not good enough.

569
01:24:53,284 --> 01:25:01,424
The same I have found out with Agar. and Merc. Merc.

570
01:25:01,665 --> 01:25:06,785
Also has this preoccupation with bowel motion.

571
01:25:07,062 --> 01:25:12,182
I did not have a bowel motion today. I did not full stool.

572
01:25:12,944 --> 01:25:19,585
And this is a very big preoccupation. But in him it’s exaggerated.

573
01:25:19,862 --> 01:25:29,825
It’s quite strong the symptom because he does not empty the colon and he has to go several times.

574
01:25:38,385 --> 01:25:46,065
– Was there any anxious movement just because the complaints started after you left the army,

575
01:25:46,165 --> 01:25:49,384
you felt the army may call you back.

576
01:25:53,740 --> 01:26:00,652
– No. I left the army happily, if I can say so.

577
01:26:00,904 --> 01:26:09,100
And as far as the first question it started gradually that’s why I cannot say in a certain day.

578
01:26:09,612 --> 01:26:13,704
It was gradually and I didn’t pay attention in the beginning.

579
01:26:15,284 --> 01:26:23,692
–This is a good question which I also had. The answer is this, what he says.

580
01:26:27,821 --> 01:26:37,622
This is something which is connected with some kind of fear or anxiety or both

581
01:26:37,864 --> 01:26:46,064
that affected the nervous system on this level and not affected the mental emotional.

582
01:26:46,305 --> 01:26:49,654
– I would like to ask one question because he says he is full of energy

583
01:26:50,145 --> 01:26:56,054
and isn’t that a main symptom that you got diarrhea without any weakness?

584
01:26:56,545 --> 01:27:01,424
– As far as my energy is concerned, it’s kind flow.

585
01:27:01,665 --> 01:27:10,384
When I started the day from one day to another and I quit the milk and wheat I was full of energy.

586
01:27:10,625 --> 01:27:18,064
– But now his energy is low, with this condition. Head pain with coryza.

587
01:27:19,585 --> 01:27:29,064
What happened with his was that he got an inflammation most probably on the frontal sinuses,

588
01:27:29,343 --> 01:27:33,704
very severe inflammation because the pain was unbearable,

589
01:27:33,944 --> 01:27:38,304
he was lying down there without being able to move

590
01:27:38,572 --> 01:27:47,020
and suddenly the canals opened and the discharge started and he was relieved with the headache,

591
01:27:47,264 --> 01:27:53,664
only occasionally now you have it and the discharge continued from that time.

592
01:27:55,652 --> 01:28:01,825
So the correct remedy will bring back this headache.

593
01:28:05,942 --> 01:28:13,622
The bowel motion started after operation?
– Yes, Ι believe a few months after.

594
01:28:14,134 --> 01:28:25,142
I believe even 1 year after.
– What may have happened?

595
01:28:25,655 --> 01:28:32,584
– He had an inguinal repair the first one and then he had a second re-repair after that within a year.

596
01:28:32,824 --> 01:28:37,184
He’s got fibrous tissue formed and he got retention in urine coming through.

597
01:28:37,352 --> 01:28:40,417
Difficulty passing, the same symptom again, the mechanism is affected.

598
01:28:42,104 --> 01:28:48,264
So he had an inflammation along his pelvic plexus leading to the base of the spine

599
01:28:48,504 --> 01:28:54,144
which will show nothing on the scan but that’s where it started...

600
01:28:54,412 --> 01:28:57,984
The problem probably arises from the surgery.

601
01:28:58,252 --> 01:29:12,824
– This is the idea of this tissues forming after the operation, scar tissue.

602
01:29:15,144 --> 01:29:23,064
Adhesions. The creation of adhesion after the operation.

603
01:29:25,944 --> 01:29:29,334
You had twice this operation?
– No.

604
01:29:30,614 --> 01:29:40,584
– The second time the hernia started coming back and you still had it.

605
01:29:42,625 --> 01:29:54,934
But the bowel problems came one year after the hernia operation.

606
01:29:55,184 --> 01:29:57,985
Is that correct?
– Yes.

607
01:29:57,985 --> 01:30:02,864
– So most probably it is connected, what he says is correct,

608
01:30:03,105 --> 01:30:17,185
some adhesions were formed that most probably affected or cramped some nerves that nerve the colon.

609
01:30:19,504 --> 01:30:23,944
– In the inguinal canal he would still have either part of the large intestine,

610
01:30:24,184 --> 01:30:27,784
part of the small intestine going down and each time it goes down

611
01:30:28,024 --> 01:30:32,140
it will cause him to have retention of the bowel and the stool won’t work correctly

612
01:30:32,384 --> 01:30:36,984
and he pushes it back up and he has a good day...

613
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:46,464
But if he’s still got an inguinal hernia he is still going to keep influencing him.

614
01:30:46,732 --> 01:30:51,064
– That’s correct.
– And he cannot press as strong as he could without the hernia.

615
01:30:52,620 --> 01:31:06,584
– Can you press to have a stool without problem of the hernia? You can. He can press.

616
01:31:06,828 --> 01:31:12,224
But still the hernia comes out quite strongly?

617
01:31:12,737 --> 01:31:17,857
– It’s not so severe. I can see it, I can feel it sometimes but it’s not so severe.

618
01:31:18,104 --> 01:31:23,984
That’s why I don’t do the second surgery. But I can push.

619
01:31:28,588 --> 01:31:39,617
– Does the hernia being out or being inside have anything to do with the condition of the bowels?

620
01:31:39,764 --> 01:31:44,737
–No. I doesn’t really bother me.

621
01:31:45,184 --> 01:31:58,028
– I would rather think of the adhesions affecting the nervous system by pressure.

622
01:31:58,544 --> 01:32:07,264
– If it was related to the hernia operation why was he quite normal 1 week after Pod.?

623
01:32:07,504 --> 01:32:19,297
For 1 week it was working quite well and when he had this diet for half a year it worked normally.

624
01:32:19,544 --> 01:32:24,144
– The second thing you said is more valid. When he had the diet.

625
01:32:24,417 --> 01:32:27,984
This is also correct what you are saying.

626
01:32:28,257 --> 01:32:38,744
Why when he had the diet he had much better stool, actually.

627
01:32:47,820 --> 01:32:53,184
– Cause anytime you have a herniated part you get a build-up of abnormal bacteria

628
01:32:53,452 --> 01:32:55,744
in a short space of time so you get abnormal gas.

629
01:32:59,064 --> 01:33:04,704
You change the diet, you modify the entire flora of the gut and so he has a reasonably good time.

630
01:33:05,224 --> 01:33:08,444
You stick something that is an allergen it will trigger the fermentation process

631
01:33:08,612 --> 01:33:13,544
in the circulated part, whichever is circulating. And he’s got a problem!

632
01:33:14,572 --> 01:33:22,504
– Is it possible that we may have some structural changes that could not be seen?

633
01:33:22,744 --> 01:33:26,584
Do you have a CAT scan?

634
01:33:27,104 --> 01:33:33,302
– No, but I had most of the conventional medicine tests.

635
01:33:33,544 --> 01:33:38,422
– You did all the examinations? And they did not find anything?

636
01:33:38,934 --> 01:33:42,262
– They didn’t find anything wrong...
- Except of the allergy?

637
01:33:42,774 --> 01:33:49,174
– They didn’t find allergy either.
– No they found allergies.

638
01:33:49,424 --> 01:33:55,532
They found that you are allergic to milk.
– That’s what I found, not them.

639
01:33:55,784 --> 01:33:58,344
– You noticed?
– Yes.

640
01:33:58,584 --> 01:34:05,260
- They did not tell you?
– I had many blood tests.

641
01:34:06,540 --> 01:34:15,500
– You noticed! They did not tell you to stop eating bread, milk.

642
01:34:16,504 --> 01:34:22,412
– That was a special laboratory in the states. They told me about this.

643
01:34:23,180 --> 01:34:28,812
– That’s what I say. They said you have a lot of allergies.

644
01:34:29,064 --> 01:34:39,052
– But then when I stopped taking them, few months after it gradually returned.

645
01:34:39,304 --> 01:34:42,294
In spite of the fact I did not all of them.

646
01:34:42,544 --> 01:34:51,254
– In spite of the fact you did not eat the symptoms started coming back?
– Yes.

647
01:34:51,504 --> 01:34:58,145
– In pathology the big remedies they have quite a lot of symptoms.

648
01:34:58,422 --> 01:35:02,774
Thousands of symptoms within them you can find similar symptoms.

649
01:35:03,024 --> 01:35:11,464
And unless you find something which is a keynote or an essential feature is his character,

650
01:35:11,984 --> 01:35:18,134
you say he’s very closed, I see he’s very much suffering because of grief...

651
01:35:18,384 --> 01:35:25,544
You cannot and give Nat-m. and expect to have an effect.

652
01:35:26,064 --> 01:35:35,543
Nat-c. Yes. Because it has this aversion to milk and diarrhea from milk, diarrhea from honey.

653
01:35:36,054 --> 01:35:39,624
These things are keynotes of Nat-c. and you can yes.

654
01:35:39,894 --> 01:35:56,534
Nat-c. is a strong possibility but he has not the sensitivity to the sun.

655
01:35:57,025 --> 01:36:04,705
I have never seen so far a Nat-c. without sensitivity to the sun.

656
01:36:04,982 --> 01:36:09,064
He may be altogether different in this level,

657
01:36:09,334 --> 01:36:15,984
he may be just normal because temperature-wise his organism is working quite well.

658
01:36:16,225 --> 01:36:22,134
– Excuse from my notes he’s already given Nat-m.

659
01:36:23,664 --> 01:36:37,192
– The only remedy which has keynotes is Nat-c.

660
01:36:42,184 --> 01:36:59,064
The thing is that most probably underneath this is Thuja condition.

661
01:36:59,584 --> 01:37:04,184
Now is Thuja underneath or on top?

662
01:37:04,460 --> 01:37:13,664
Definitely with the aversion to onions which he says Thuja must have been as a young man

663
01:37:13,932 --> 01:37:19,544
the remedy mostly indicated and that’s why it comes up.

664
01:37:19,820 --> 01:37:29,544
And the other thing that takes me away from Nat-c. is the fact that except from the sensitivity,

665
01:37:29,784 --> 01:37:38,744
since the digestive is involved how is that the stomach is not involved in this case

666
01:37:39,264 --> 01:37:45,144
where Nat-c. primarily is a person who cannot digest,

667
01:37:45,664 --> 01:37:52,332
eats and has pain, no digestion and suffering in the stomach area.

668
01:37:52,824 --> 01:37:56,664
He suffers from there onwards.

669
01:37:59,444 --> 01:38:15,104
I have similar cases but together with mental or emotional disturbances which I had tried for years to calm down.

670
01:38:15,624 --> 01:38:20,224
An irritable bowel for years with careful prescribing.

671
01:38:20,492 --> 01:38:27,384
And it still goes very slowly. Don’t think this is an easy case.

672
01:38:27,904 --> 01:38:36,620
Now, what is the first remedy? Thuja.

673
01:38:36,864 --> 01:38:57,344
Who says Thuja? Who says Nat-c.? Who says Mag-m.? Who says Nit-ac.?

674
01:38:57,612 --> 01:39:21,424
Who says Cub.? The most logical will be to give Nat-c.

675
01:39:21,697 --> 01:39:28,588
Show me the last repertorization.

676
01:39:30,704 --> 01:39:37,548
How do you react with eating vegetables? Good?

677
01:39:37,824 --> 01:39:43,820
It doesn’t depend on the type of food you eat, at all. Your bowel motion.

678
01:39:44,064 --> 01:39:49,504
– No. I didn’t notice. Besides the milk and the honey that I have noticed strongly, nothing else.

679
01:39:49,772 --> 01:39:56,172
– Bread?
– Yes, I am eating bread.

680
01:40:01,584 --> 01:40:11,105
– After stool do you have to lie down and make some exercises to specially relax your bowels?

681
01:40:11,382 --> 01:40:19,304
– No, not really. Sometimes when I am really tired and if I lie down,

682
01:40:19,574 --> 01:40:25,974
it’s a little bit good for me. But it’s very rare.

683
01:40:26,224 --> 01:40:30,305
I don’t have time to rest after every time.

684
01:40:34,984 --> 01:40:41,584
– We’ll give him a dose of Nat-c. 200C.

685
01:40:41,825 --> 01:40:47,984
It was the first remedy I wrote, the only remedy I wrote as soon as I heard

686
01:40:48,225 --> 01:40:50,024
but then I doubt it very much.

687
01:40:50,544 --> 01:40:58,984
Now I am thinking it’s not possible that the remedy could not have been given.

688
01:40:59,254 --> 01:41:08,705
In case he has received , then we go to Mag-m.

689
01:41:08,983 --> 01:41:17,942
He will try Mag-m. and then as a third remedy Thuja.

690
01:41:22,024 --> 01:41:30,544
Why Thuja?
- What is the justification?

691
01:41:31,724 --> 01:41:42,144
– I think there was an effect of vaccination on him beforehand.

692
01:41:42,412 --> 01:41:49,824
Then again he was vaccinated in the army and I believe the second vaccination had an effect

693
01:41:50,092 --> 01:41:56,984
and the effect ended up to that condition.

694
01:41:57,260 --> 01:42:08,504
I don’t know if this is absolutely direct or not, involving other factors as well.

695
01:42:09,544 --> 01:42:22,092
Thuja gave us a keynote quite close and gave another keynote which was...

696
01:42:22,344 --> 01:42:26,424
You found 2 keynotes actually in this case.

697
01:42:26,828 --> 01:42:46,064
– Bladder incomplete, obliged to urinate 5 or 6 times. Onions.

698
01:42:46,205 --> 01:42:48,908
- Yes. Onions, he used to have it in the past.

699
01:42:49,424 --> 01:42:56,344
We have some symptoms and we have the vaccination and that’s why we are thinking of Thuja.

700
01:42:57,004 --> 01:43:05,057
– Also is the catarrhs in Thuja that blocks the urethra...

701
01:43:05,548 --> 01:43:13,228
- Also it’s interesting as I ask him the question Thuja has a catarrh of this type

702
01:43:13,744 --> 01:43:22,188
but when they go for stool they moment they have defecation the nose is running constantly.

703
01:43:22,464 --> 01:43:28,504
It’s like opening a valve and the nose runs during stool.

704
01:43:28,780 --> 01:43:29,784
But he did not confirm.

705
01:43:30,060 --> 01:43:37,740
If he had said yes to that we would not be discussing all this time but he said no.

706
01:43:39,264 --> 01:43:51,820
– I have a question about the timing how you decide when to give for example Mag-m. followed by Thuja?

707
01:43:52,064 --> 01:44:01,544
– What are the deciding factors.
– Yes, how do you determine that.

708
01:44:01,784 --> 01:44:11,020
– Well, if he has been given already Nat-c. and did not act we don’t lose the time just repeating Nat-c.

709
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:18,944
The second possibility is Mag-m. from repertorization and the third possibility is Thuja

710
01:44:19,212 --> 01:44:27,384
because of the combination of vaccination with certain of his symptoms, characteristics.

711
01:44:27,660 --> 01:44:31,500
And then of course the possibility of Cub. may be there.

712
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:37,132
By tomorrow morning we’ll have the answer definitely. And then we decide.

713
01:44:37,384 --> 01:44:51,104
Who wants to give Nat-c.? Less people now. Who wants to give Mag-m.? Less people.

714
01:44:51,344 --> 01:45:10,544
Who wants to give Thuja? Thuja is a good prescription for him as a starting at least case.

715
01:45:10,817 --> 01:45:15,664
We will decide tomorrow whether it will be.

716
01:45:15,937 --> 01:45:29,228
We got the information from the homeopath from Israel. The information is that he even had Nat-c.

717
01:45:29,744 --> 01:45:50,988
We are very sorry about it! I will start the case with Thuja 50M.

718
01:45:55,808 --> 01:46:09,697
I remember one of my first cases I had to solve was a very nice young woman who I liked very much

719
01:46:09,944 --> 01:46:14,544
also she was a pianist and she came to take her case,

720
01:46:14,817 --> 01:46:25,304
one of my first cases and of course I took very detailed information and I repertorized for 3 days.

721
01:46:25,548 --> 01:46:31,704
3 days, 3 nights, repertorized the case because it wouldn’t come.

722
01:46:32,737 --> 01:46:41,697
And the third night I went to bed and I woke up in the morning.

723
01:46:41,944 --> 01:46:50,144
As soon as I woke up, I don’t remember the dream, I said Ign.!

724
01:46:50,657 --> 01:46:58,064
Ign. acted beautifully but it was working in my subconscious mind or whatever

725
01:46:58,584 --> 01:47:08,304
and then I thought she is romantic, hysterical, a pianist, an artist,

726
01:47:08,824 --> 01:47:14,704
I put all these together, I’m talking 1960.

727
01:47:15,224 --> 01:47:21,377
I put these together and the remedy came.

728
01:47:21,624 --> 01:47:27,024
So this is something also that we see in Thuja cases.

729
01:47:27,265 --> 01:47:35,222
In Thuja case we don’t have a clear case and we battle.

730
01:47:35,464 --> 01:47:42,902
We don’t get a straightforward symptom and then you have some keynotes of Thuja

731
01:47:43,144 --> 01:47:55,984
and the fact that we have the vaccination and the fact that the nose is running and I know this running nose of Thuja.

732
01:47:56,504 --> 01:48:06,744
It seems to me finally after all this turmoil that maybe we have to start with Thuja

733
01:48:06,988 --> 01:48:16,984
though I don’t think that his condition will be solved totally through this remedy.

734
01:48:17,228 --> 01:48:23,384
But we will see how far it may go and maybe the next remedy will develop

735
01:48:23,628 --> 01:48:30,544
will be much clearer and then it will give much better results. 50M.
