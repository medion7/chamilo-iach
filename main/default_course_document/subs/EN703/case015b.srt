1
00:00:19,184 --> 00:00:25,584
What I want from Andrew is to give me a general impression of what happened

2
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:29,174
and then we can go to details and find out...

3
00:00:32,502 --> 00:00:41,185
- 3 of July she was given Verat. 200 and next day Verat. 1M.

4
00:00:41,462 --> 00:00:53,224
She slept for 1 hour and immediately developed this constipation, very hard and large stool.

5
00:00:53,744 --> 00:00:59,894
Very difficult and painful. And that remained the same since.

6
00:01:02,184 --> 00:01:14,224
Then she had an aggravation, slept for 13 hours, vomited and had a fit.

7
00:01:17,302 --> 00:01:29,324
– Didn’t go to the hospital.
– It wasn't severe as usual.

8
00:01:29,424 --> 00:01:39,664
When she came through this I think she started to show signs of genupectoral position, knee-chest.

9
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:46,124
– I would find her on the floor in this position in the house.

10
00:01:48,624 --> 00:01:57,585
The main thing was she slept longer than normal.

11
00:01:57,757 --> 00:02:03,468
Even in the day, she would sleep for an hour and a half.

12
00:02:03,744 --> 00:02:14,888
– When she developed the knee-chest position, how long after Verat. was it?

13
00:02:14,988 --> 00:02:29,857
– First week. After the aggravation. Then I think in August, not so many changes.

14
00:02:30,004 --> 00:02:39,308
– The only thing that I can see here after 20 days developing very offensive diarrhea,

15
00:02:39,824 --> 00:02:51,344
vomited bile and for a few days she had diarrhea and the stool became not so big.

16
00:02:55,948 --> 00:03:07,224
On the end of August she was irritable, clingy, bearing head, tantrums.

17
00:03:07,744 --> 00:03:13,864
On the 22 of September cold, dry cough started.

18
00:03:14,104 --> 00:03:23,284
Then she started having an acute. Temperature raised up to 38C.

19
00:03:23,384 --> 00:03:27,664
– Convulsion.
– A really bad convulsion. It lasted an hour.

20
00:03:27,805 --> 00:03:31,645
– And when she had bad convulsion, in October?

21
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:42,617
– Beginning of October, then contacted you and you said Verat. 200C.

22
00:03:42,717 --> 00:03:50,744
– You did not give 1M here. Only 200C.
– 8th of October.

23
00:03:50,888 --> 00:04:01,544
– Then fever continued and reached up to 41,8C.
– 2 fits and vomit.

24
00:04:01,644 --> 00:04:10,188
– And she had convulsions with vomiting and Bell. was given, 30C, only one dose?

25
00:04:10,288 --> 00:04:17,624
– Yes, only one dose.
– And she kept on the knee-elbow position

26
00:04:17,868 --> 00:04:27,617
and on the 30th of November was given Med. 200C.
– Yes, we contacted you again.

27
00:04:27,717 --> 00:04:34,146
– In the analysis I have said most probably the next remedy will be Med.

28
00:04:34,422 --> 00:04:43,382
After that she developed strabismus.
– It became worse.

29
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:53,864
– Stool frequent already on the 3rd of December, 4 stools a day.

30
00:04:54,384 --> 00:04:59,254
Stools extremely large and painful.

31
00:04:59,745 --> 00:05:08,464
Can only pass the stool standing because sometimes it was like a tennis ball.

32
00:05:10,865 --> 00:05:16,385
– I think we had a follow up appointment...

33
00:05:16,662 --> 00:05:22,294
- And what happened with the ear infection?

34
00:05:22,444 --> 00:05:29,085
– Her first perception was that she was much better.

35
00:05:29,185 --> 00:05:36,780
– Yes, she was talking more, she was like in awakening.

36
00:05:37,024 --> 00:05:46,744
She responded better and understood what you wanted her to do more.

37
00:05:48,812 --> 00:05:56,492
And in January everybody, even the teachers in her nursery said that she was communicating better.

38
00:05:56,744 --> 00:06:10,824
– Then she developed acute.
– Cough, fever but no fits after Med.

39
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,704
– And she had quite a few fevers before the ear.

40
00:06:16,972 --> 00:06:22,092
– Before the otitis developed, in January.

41
00:06:22,344 --> 00:06:32,064
– In January 2002.
– Very painful, crying and clinging at night,

42
00:06:32,332 --> 00:06:37,452
it went on until we spoke again with you.

43
00:06:37,552 --> 00:06:47,628
– She had fever with very strong thirst for cold drinks, I suggested Phos. and nothing happened.

44
00:06:47,904 --> 00:06:56,502
I think you tried Puls. We contacted you and you said to take Puls. 200C.

45
00:06:56,744 --> 00:07:08,264
– I see Verat. is never repeated in 1M, where in the beginning we gave 200C and 1M, you repeated only 200C.

46
00:07:08,534 --> 00:07:14,222
If you repeat a lower than the first, it will not be acting.

47
00:07:14,322 --> 00:07:17,345
But anyhow, nothing happened with the otitis?

48
00:07:17,622 --> 00:07:24,334
Otitis developed more and more severe, discharging a lot of pus.

49
00:07:24,434 --> 00:07:32,214
– After Verat. the pain went and then the discharge started.

50
00:07:32,364 --> 00:07:38,002
– So we said wait.
– For how long?

51
00:07:38,102 --> 00:07:47,062
– 3 weeks.
– For 3 weeks the ear was discharging and then what happened?

52
00:07:49,422 --> 00:07:59,585
– I think another acute with vomiting and then the ear became painful again.

53
00:07:59,762 --> 00:08:04,464
– We gave her Verat. in the evening because the vomiting wouldn’t stop

54
00:08:04,705 --> 00:08:10,864
and the vomiting happened every hour for 6 hours throughout the night.

55
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:32,104
– So you gave Verat. 200C again on the 1st of February, and then what happened? Nothing.

56
00:08:32,374 --> 00:08:35,944
– She got worse with the vomiting.

57
00:08:36,464 --> 00:08:41,334
– What about the ear discharge?
– It got worse.

58
00:08:41,584 --> 00:08:49,782
It turned a nasty dark green and the ear started to swell and protrude out of her head.

59
00:08:49,924 --> 00:08:54,134
– Was it smelling badly?
– No.

60
00:09:03,344 --> 00:09:06,017
– And then you couldn’t wait anymore.

61
00:09:06,264 --> 00:09:12,144
– No, because she hadn’t been eating, we had been waiting for 3 weeks and she hadn’t been eating properly

62
00:09:12,417 --> 00:09:19,692
and she lost 3 kilos in weight and it was just a miserable little girl.

63
00:09:19,944 --> 00:09:28,384
– Did you take her to the hospital?
– No, the doctor came and prescribed amoxicillin liquid.

64
00:09:28,552 --> 00:09:35,304
The next day it was cleared up, she was eating immediately.

65
00:09:42,684 --> 00:09:50,412
– After the antibiotics she started again having convulsions?
– Yes.

66
00:09:50,664 --> 00:09:59,124
– And how many times from January until today she had convulsions?

67
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:20,224
– She has had 1, only 5 minutes. She was awful.

68
00:10:20,492 --> 00:10:29,260
She changed, she was very irritable, wouldn’t comply, was doing a lot of sparing of the head,

69
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:37,184
crawling backwards on the floor. Peculiar thing.

70
00:10:39,224 --> 00:10:46,024
She was coming to our bedroom crawling backwards and usually with the head on the floor.

71
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:58,424
– And was very disobedient. Still is?
– She is now, she is very disputed now.

72
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:04,984
– For the last 6-8 weeks she has been impossible. Absolutely uncontrollable.

73
00:11:05,228 --> 00:11:10,864
– Hitting, banging her head on the floor.

74
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:15,744
She throws herself on the floor when you say no to her.

75
00:11:15,984 --> 00:11:24,704
– If you say no to her, if you are close enough....
– You get a hit.

76
00:11:24,804 --> 00:11:29,304
– If she is not close enough to hit you she will hit herself.

77
00:11:29,548 --> 00:11:41,585
With the flat of her hands on the head like this and then if she still doesn’t get a response,

78
00:11:41,857 --> 00:11:48,748
she will throw herself on the floor and either she is faced down banging her head on the floor

79
00:11:49,024 --> 00:11:55,148
or she is lying on her back she will hit the heels on the floor.

80
00:11:56,428 --> 00:12:11,297
– Thank you sweetie! Go to your mother. Forget it!

81
00:12:13,184 --> 00:12:21,537
– Her attention span is very short.

82
00:12:21,784 --> 00:12:32,825
She loves a tape or a book or whatever but she will lose her interest within 30 seconds and wants to go on.

83
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,995
As you saw she is still going to strangers,

84
00:12:38,095 --> 00:12:46,424
the camera was a source of great fascination to her and she remembered you.

85
00:12:47,186 --> 00:12:53,464
Toileting, I think she has almost come backwards because she was almost straining

86
00:12:53,711 --> 00:12:57,551
but the last 6-8 weeks it’s like she is rebelling.

87
00:12:57,827 --> 00:13:05,746
She asks for the potty or the toilet continuously, so you never know when she is serious.

88
00:13:10,327 --> 00:13:38,060
– Change places with Andrew. On the 11th of April she received Med. 1M.

89
00:13:39,064 --> 00:13:41,132
but you see up to now no real change, as I understand.

90
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,704
– We had a change. She was more compliant, easier to...

91
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:50,860
- No, I mean lately.
– She has gone backwards.

92
00:13:51,104 --> 00:13:57,824
– She needs another “centralization”.

93
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:10,624
– She is disobedient, worse from contradiction,

94
00:14:11,904 --> 00:14:19,340
if you deny something to her she will become aggressive against herself or against others.

95
00:14:19,584 --> 00:14:23,944
– Against us if we are close enough or against herself.

96
00:14:24,188 --> 00:14:27,266
Not particularly to strangers.

97
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:33,666
– It’s the person saying no to her.
– I can prove it now!

98
00:14:48,013 --> 00:15:03,106
– Go to your mother otherwise I will....!
– Alexander come here please!

99
00:15:12,066 --> 00:15:15,388
– Is she making a lot of grimaces?

100
00:15:15,663 --> 00:15:21,788
– One think I’ve noticed she very much talks to one side like this.

101
00:15:22,573 --> 00:15:31,533
Talks with her mouth sideways and she quite often holds that position,

102
00:15:33,064 --> 00:15:41,506
but she still holds her mouth like this and when she talks it’s with this expression.

103
00:15:45,346 --> 00:15:50,223
– Does she grind her teeth during sleep?
– Yes, a lot.

104
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:57,628
– So you can actually hear it?
– She doesn’t do it anymore since last year.

105
00:15:59,944 --> 00:16:03,784
– She does it now lately?
– No.

106
00:16:04,028 --> 00:16:08,653
– There are not so much to grind if you look it’s only one way, one side.

107
00:16:08,904 --> 00:16:12,493
– A year ago she used to very badly in the sleep.

108
00:16:12,744 --> 00:16:15,304
– Was there any TB in your family?

109
00:16:15,548 --> 00:16:22,223
– I think so, yes. I think in my family.
– Not in mine.

110
00:16:26,306 --> 00:16:42,428
– Go there stay! Can you tell me if you give her some meat with fat will she eat the fat?

111
00:16:44,988 --> 00:16:48,828
– Yes. We don’t give her much fat.

112
00:16:50,383 --> 00:16:52,424
– Fruits?
– She loves fruits.

113
00:16:52,668 --> 00:17:00,348
– Which fruits she likes the most.
– Strawberries, kiwi.

114
00:17:01,384 --> 00:17:09,308
– She chooses oranges but she gets the juice from them and she leaves the pulp.

115
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:14,428
– Bananas?
– Yes. It’s not her favorite.

116
00:17:23,388 --> 00:17:26,984
– Lately she has no more vomiting?
– No.

117
00:17:29,026 --> 00:17:34,413
– And she’s coughing?
– She still got this cough from 6 weeks ago.

118
00:17:34,664 --> 00:17:39,023
– The ear never discharged again after the antibiotics.
– No.

119
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:44,386
– How many days you gave antibiotics?
– 3 days.

120
00:17:44,904 --> 00:17:51,823
– But with the first antibiotic the discharged stopped. Correct?
–Yes.

121
00:17:55,906 --> 00:18:02,306
– Tell me if you remember as a baby she had ear infection?

122
00:18:03,068 --> 00:18:06,908
– Only a mild one once.

123
00:18:07,183 --> 00:18:11,784
– You don’t remember her having discharge from the ear?
– Never.

124
00:18:12,033 --> 00:18:17,425
– It’s difficult because babies cry and it was red.

125
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:21,537
– You don’t remember something dramatic.

126
00:18:21,788 --> 00:18:27,665
– She only had upper respiratory infections.

127
00:18:27,937 --> 00:18:31,777
Always coughing at nights, it always starts and is worse at nights.

128
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:40,737
– Does she perspire in the night?
– Terribly. She is very sweaty. She’s very warm.

129
00:18:41,745 --> 00:19:13,252
– Sweetie, Alex! Let me see your teeth! She is shy?

130
00:19:17,092 --> 00:19:26,306
Her teeth are worn out. How old is she now?
- 4,5.

131
00:19:51,137 --> 00:19:57,026
– You remember you said she was kissing everybody during that time,

132
00:19:57,265 --> 00:20:00,612
she is not doing it anymore?
– Not as much.

133
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:08,546
– The restlessness that was quite strong during that time is still the same or less?

134
00:20:10,588 --> 00:20:18,017
– A bit less. She asks to go to bed when she is tired.

135
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:29,775
– She used to have a tottering gait.
– A little bit.

136
00:20:30,026 --> 00:20:37,706
– Still there?
– A little bit but we've started taking her to trambolining and she’s quite good.

137
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:51,152
– But the tottering is still there, the same, less?
– It’s a little less.

138
00:20:51,428 --> 00:20:58,585
– The desire for fruit is as strong as it used to be?
– Not quite.

139
00:21:00,388 --> 00:21:04,985
– How much salt she likes?
– Not as much.

140
00:21:05,508 --> 00:21:13,188
– We spoke last year about something we have called mamait which she could live on this.

141
00:21:13,427 --> 00:21:27,779
Now she is not keen.
– During heat she had convulsions.

142
00:21:28,025 --> 00:21:38,265
Now here in this environment, it’s quite hot, did you have anything?
– No.

143
00:21:40,068 --> 00:21:45,188
– Thank you!
– Thank you!

144
00:21:47,225 --> 00:21:58,499
What happened with this case? What do you think?

145
00:22:02,832 --> 00:22:11,792
It was improving until the ear was discharging.

146
00:22:12,307 --> 00:22:20,506
And you see full amelioration in a case where we have a retarded child,

147
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:24,100
beautiful reaction with the ear

148
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:34,068
but we were not able to stop the discharge and the inflammation that was going on.

149
00:22:37,908 --> 00:22:42,784
I could not have details so I just said to repeat the remedy.

150
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:47,650
They repeated lower potency than the one they should have repeated.

151
00:22:47,904 --> 00:22:51,490
1M was given in the beginning, 200C was repeated

152
00:22:51,744 --> 00:22:58,660
and the whole thing ended up in taking antibiotics which is the most unfortunate thing to happen.

153
00:23:00,704 --> 00:23:07,866
Because after that we very seldom get a clear picture.

154
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:11,706
Because you cannot say repeat again Verat.

155
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:18,624
There is no restlessness anymore so strong as it was in the beginning.

156
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:27,066
Then you give Verat. and immediately develops the picture of Med.; knee-elbow position.

157
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:34,500
You give Med. and then you have an acute

158
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:42,180
and you will see if you take the whole course the importance of having strong acutes

159
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:50,868
after and the importance of treating the acute correctly with Homeopathy.

160
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:56,260
Because even treating the acutes wrongly with Homeopathy you may have relapses.

161
00:23:56,770 --> 00:24:03,170
If we were able to treat this girl correctly you would see a totally different child.

162
00:24:03,424 --> 00:24:07,264
You will see a child in her age which would be a miracle.

163
00:24:07,508 --> 00:24:10,340
I didn’t want to say it in the beginning

164
00:24:10,586 --> 00:24:15,706
but we have seen such cases developing so well that it’s unbelievable.

165
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:18,837
It’s a pity that such progress has to be stopped

166
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:26,106
by interfering with antibiotics and now what is the picture?

167
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:29,707
Is this a picture of Med.? Where is the knee-elbow position?

168
00:24:29,946 --> 00:24:32,016
It’s not there which is the main symptom.

169
00:24:32,267 --> 00:24:36,864
The oranges... she takes a little bit and spits them.

170
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:45,067
There are no symptoms of Med. There are no symptoms of Verat.

171
00:24:50,187 --> 00:25:05,306
Restlessness mostly. What is the picture now?

172
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:13,504
What can you give now? You have very little to go by.

173
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:36,026
A picture of what I see is a child which is disobedient, aggressive, hitting herself, does not listen,

174
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:51,140
hits the others and at the same time some infections of the respiratory tract are going on.

175
00:26:07,508 --> 00:26:15,188
Can you give me the symptoms without showing the remedy?

176
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:49,504
If you have put this in your repertorization the remedy would be... what?

177
00:26:54,624 --> 00:27:03,828
Tub. is the remedy. Why?

178
00:27:08,948 --> 00:27:15,866
You can argue and say she is not grinding her teeth which is a keynote for Tub.

179
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:20,468
Why Mr. George you are giving Tub.?

180
00:27:20,986 --> 00:27:28,148
The reason is we don’t have to have all the keynotes, we have the excessive perspiration,

181
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:36,864
she perspires a lot now, respiratory symptoms are prominent and constant.

182
00:27:37,890 --> 00:28:01,145
Not only that but we see Tub. has 13 out of 16 symptoms.

183
00:28:04,464 --> 00:28:11,626
Actually the knocking her head against the wall is there, striking is there,

184
00:28:11,895 --> 00:28:15,466
convulsions is there, large stool is there, vomiting,

185
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:30,586
strabismus so we have a picture of Tub. which is confirmed by the fact that the mother family had Tub.

186
00:28:33,387 --> 00:28:37,986
– One symptoms missing.
– Which?

187
00:28:38,266 --> 00:28:40,826
– Intolerance of contradiction in children.

188
00:28:41,067 --> 00:28:59,707
– Find this. Mind-contradiction intolerance in children. Tarent. also a possibility.

189
00:29:04,588 --> 00:29:09,947
The possibility for Tarent. might have been

190
00:29:12,507 --> 00:29:20,705
but the excessive perspiration in the night plus the hereditary disposition

191
00:29:23,788 --> 00:29:25,825
plus the fact that before she was grinding her teeth.

192
00:29:28,908 --> 00:29:37,868
All these brings to the uppermost layer now the remedy Tub.

193
00:29:41,185 --> 00:29:51,781
Advance seminar I told you I am sorry. Tarent. doesn’t perspire as much.

194
00:30:04,581 --> 00:30:07,141
Tarent. is much more restless.

195
00:30:11,227 --> 00:30:16,865
But the fact that the child was grinding her teeth so much

196
00:30:17,381 --> 00:30:24,291
points out that there was time where she needed Tub. when she was born.

197
00:30:24,784 --> 00:30:29,904
I don’t know. Maybe after Tub. she will go to Calc.

198
00:30:30,181 --> 00:30:38,625
I don’t know. But at this moment, with these symptoms you have to give Tub. 1M.

199
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:49,891
– Can I ask why you didn’t take the medical case of the father and you only took the case of the mother?

200
00:30:50,907 --> 00:31:06,021
– The father’s here? Later on you will see that he had gonorrhea I think.

201
00:31:09,861 --> 00:31:29,307
NSU, non-specific-urethritis. Both!

202
00:31:36,225 --> 00:31:43,651
That’s why in the analysis it was first Verat. and Med. is coming.

203
00:31:44,144 --> 00:31:51,461
The moment Med. symptoms came up we just jumped to Med.

204
00:31:51,707 --> 00:31:55,644
Now as you all agree we give Tub.
