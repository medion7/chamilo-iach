1
00:00:20,028 --> 00:00:22,545
This is a case that comes from Denmark.

2
00:00:22,817 --> 00:00:29,464
She is 33 years old, has 3 children, she says I am very sick

3
00:00:29,711 --> 00:00:34,238
and I fell that I am not inside my body. This is the main complaint.

4
00:00:34,338 --> 00:00:40,984
I am never happy, I am tired and I feel I want to fall down.

5
00:00:41,231 --> 00:00:49,698
I have been sick for about 10 years.

6
00:00:49,944 --> 00:00:52,927
You have been sick with this coming out of your body.

7
00:00:53,027 --> 00:01:00,023
– Yes.
– You come out of your body and this makes you fearful?

8
00:01:00,547 --> 00:01:03,374
You are afraid?
– Yes.

9
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:14,104
– What else?
– I feel like my body goes away from each other.

10
00:01:14,384 --> 00:01:15,664
– Is pulling out.

11
00:01:15,907 --> 00:01:24,664
– Yes and I feel that side wants to go this way, that side wants to go the other way.

12
00:01:24,944 --> 00:01:32,344
And I feel my mind is not here. I have to concentrate very much to be there.

13
00:01:32,624 --> 00:01:37,464
– One thing I have to tell you, if you tell me a lie, I’ll make a mistake.

14
00:01:37,987 --> 00:01:39,024
– Of course I know that.

15
00:01:39,785 --> 00:01:43,374
– Because I asked you in the beginning if you have taken homeopathic remedies and you said no.

16
00:01:43,474 --> 00:01:49,626
Then we found out that you have already taken Thuja 1M.

17
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:57,306
3 times, Thuja 6X, Thuja 12C and you have also taken a complex of remedies.

18
00:01:57,481 --> 00:01:59,276
– I didn’t mean to lie, I forgot it.

19
00:01:59,627 --> 00:02:01,015
– Ok, you didn’t mean to lie but I am warning you

20
00:02:01,284 --> 00:02:07,315
that if you give me a wrong information I’ll make a wrong prescription.

21
00:02:07,415 --> 00:02:13,305
It will not be my fault. The first thing I want to ask,

22
00:02:13,546 --> 00:02:17,655
you come from Denmark, have you taken cannabis?

23
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:32,505
Have you tried cannabis, hashish, marijuana?
– Yes and pot.

24
00:02:33,015 --> 00:02:41,875
– It’s the same thing?
– Not the same but close.

25
00:02:41,975 --> 00:02:46,372
– Which is the strongest?
– I think hash.

26
00:02:46,865 --> 00:02:55,332
– And since what age you started taking hashish?
– 13.

27
00:02:56,866 --> 00:03:03,053
– These symptoms you are suffering now from, for 9 years, you are 33,

28
00:03:03,304 --> 00:03:07,906
you are actually suffering from the age of 24.

29
00:03:08,424 --> 00:03:12,508
From the age of 24 your body comes out, correct?

30
00:03:12,783 --> 00:03:16,525
– Yes. I have to tell you something.

31
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:19,267
It has not happened from one day to another.

32
00:03:19,542 --> 00:03:21,586
– Gradually, more and more.

33
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:25,426
– Yes. I don’t remember how it happened because that went slowly.

34
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:31,106
There were other symptoms before I felt I am out of my body

35
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:35,085
but I cannot remember now how it is to be inside my body.

36
00:03:35,185 --> 00:03:38,028
It’s normal for me now to be like that.

37
00:03:38,128 --> 00:03:43,693
It is not normal but I don’t remember how it was before.

38
00:03:51,624 --> 00:03:59,586
I don’t remember exactly because it was so long ago.

39
00:04:00,097 --> 00:04:14,428
– When you started using hash, you did it every day or 3 times a day or 5 times a day?

40
00:04:16,737 --> 00:04:21,857
In the beginning you got once and then slowly you took more?

41
00:04:22,163 --> 00:04:26,017
– No, it is not like that. In the weekend if I want to have fun.

42
00:04:26,268 --> 00:04:32,832
I don’t take it the other days because I need to control certain things.

43
00:04:32,932 --> 00:04:37,348
I take it with my friends to have fun and we sit together

44
00:04:37,623 --> 00:04:40,874
and we smoke hash, laughing and everything...

45
00:04:40,974 --> 00:04:44,065
- What was your reaction when you smoked hash?

46
00:04:44,345 --> 00:04:50,986
– I am laughing. But I stopped because one day I was not laughing any more.

47
00:04:51,255 --> 00:04:55,628
– Did you see some illusions?
– No.

48
00:04:55,867 --> 00:05:05,381
I don’t see anything but one day, somebody opened the window.

49
00:05:05,627 --> 00:05:08,451
I wanted them to open it because I was very hot

50
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:14,851
but when they opened the window I started to become cold and I wanted to close it.

51
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,502
I was telling them all the time to open and close it.

52
00:05:19,745 --> 00:05:21,962
Every time they opened it I started to feel very cold

53
00:05:22,062 --> 00:05:24,865
and when they closed it I started to feel very hot.

54
00:05:25,132 --> 00:05:28,469
– And that made you stop taking hashish?

55
00:05:28,741 --> 00:05:41,787
– That and another time where I drank alcohol and used hash in the same time.

56
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:54,341
I remember I was in a disco and I walked and the door started to appear smaller, coming to me...

57
00:05:54,587 --> 00:06:00,987
- You thought you would suffocate.
– Yes.

58
00:06:02,585 --> 00:06:13,541
– Did you ever feel that you are getting crazy?
– When I smoked hash?

59
00:06:13,787 --> 00:06:17,656
– Yes. Or later on in these 9 years.
– Yes.

60
00:06:17,905 --> 00:06:22,266
– All the time you have this fear?

61
00:06:24,546 --> 00:06:29,425
– Not when I smoke hash but sometimes I feel I’m getting crazy.

62
00:06:33,286 --> 00:06:43,746
– You say here you went to many doctors, you spent all your money but still you are very sick.

63
00:06:44,026 --> 00:06:50,426
I cannot live a normal life, I don’t like to be with people and I cannot have a job.

64
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:56,546
I try to be strong for my children and give them a normal and good life as possible.

65
00:06:56,826 --> 00:07:05,406
I remember that time I was inside my body and I was not sick.

66
00:07:05,506 --> 00:07:11,308
I was happy and I liked life. Now I just survive.

67
00:07:11,547 --> 00:07:15,669
I long to be normal and have normal life like everybody.

68
00:07:15,941 --> 00:07:21,571
I want to be a good mother and I hope to have a job so I can give myself and my children a good life.

69
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:33,761
I hope you will try to help me etc.
– I want to tell you something.

70
00:07:33,861 --> 00:07:43,829
I help myself a little, I am better than before.
– How?

71
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:51,011
– I studied flower medicine, Bach flower.
– And you practice?

72
00:07:51,265 --> 00:07:56,068
– Yes. And I help myself a little but not completely

73
00:07:56,349 --> 00:08:00,271
because maybe is difficult for me to look after myself.

74
00:08:01,304 --> 00:08:07,186
– You are divorced? You divorced with your husband or you were never married?

75
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:11,298
– I am married now for the first time.

76
00:08:11,564 --> 00:08:16,424
– So the 3 children you have are with 3 different men?
– Yes.

77
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:31,054
– When this happens you feel that one hand is going out and another foot is going out

78
00:08:31,305 --> 00:08:37,944
or from the solar plexus, from here it goes out?

79
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:48,494
– It’s not going out. I feel one side wants to go out.

80
00:09:05,104 --> 00:09:19,054
I can’t relax. I fell tense always and sometimes it’s difficult to breathe.

81
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:28,265
– She feels tightness and tension.

82
00:09:28,504 --> 00:09:34,178
– And sometimes I feel it difficult to breathe.

83
00:09:36,466 --> 00:09:43,907
– For instance you go to bed to sleep and there you leave your body

84
00:09:44,146 --> 00:09:47,747
and you go out and you roam around the room.

85
00:09:47,886 --> 00:09:54,386
– No, not like that. I just feel my soul and my body are not complete.

86
00:09:54,904 --> 00:09:57,987
They are not in harmony with each other.

87
00:09:58,226 --> 00:10:00,524
– They are separated.
– Yes.

88
00:10:00,671 --> 00:10:08,597
– But do you see sometimes while you are awake like this,

89
00:10:08,697 --> 00:10:11,747
 you see some pictures?
– No.

90
00:10:12,268 --> 00:10:24,306
– Never? You hear voices?
– No. When I was a child I saw but not now.

91
00:10:24,547 --> 00:10:33,507
When I was a child I heard voices. When I was a child I saw things in the room too.

92
00:10:33,782 --> 00:10:38,627
And when I was a child I was very much afraid of many things.

93
00:10:38,902 --> 00:10:43,257
Sometimes I was afraid that my mother would kill me.

94
00:10:43,747 --> 00:10:47,097
– What else?

95
00:10:47,862 --> 00:10:52,217
– I remember I slept in my bedroom, I was afraid

96
00:10:52,466 --> 00:11:02,984
because I was seeing things in my room and was afraid.

97
00:11:03,228 --> 00:11:05,544
I don’t know what it was but I was very afraid.

98
00:11:06,306 --> 00:11:12,465
I went to my mother and I wanted to sleep beside her on the floor.

99
00:11:12,737 --> 00:11:15,812
But I was afraid of my mother too.

100
00:11:16,066 --> 00:11:22,212
I had in my mind she wanted to kill me.

101
00:11:25,026 --> 00:11:33,988
– Do you remember if there was a thunderstorm?
– No.

102
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:43,087
– Thunderstorm is when the rain comes and then there are some noises.

103
00:11:43,187 --> 00:11:46,067
– I am not afraid of thunderstorms.

104
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:50,905
– By that time as a child you remember if you were afraid of thunderstorms?

105
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:56,131
– No. I don’t remember that. I was afraid if there was peace and silence.

106
00:11:56,624 --> 00:11:59,461
– And if the room was dark?

107
00:11:59,671 --> 00:12:04,185
– Yes, very much afraid. Now I sleep with a light on.

108
00:12:04,285 --> 00:12:14,107
I don’t sleep in the darkness. Sometimes I feel somebody is behind me.

109
00:12:14,371 --> 00:12:19,745
I stand in my kitchen and I make food and I get shocked

110
00:12:19,984 --> 00:12:24,511
because I feel somebody is next to me but here is nobody in the room.

111
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:28,506
But I feel someone is there and I am afraid.

112
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:39,508
– But do you have an idea of it is a priest or a bad man who wants to do harm to you?

113
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:45,708
– I think that there is something bad

114
00:12:45,808 --> 00:12:49,787
because if I felt it was something good I wouldn’t be afraid.

115
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:54,414
I am very much afraid and I get a shock.

116
00:12:54,604 --> 00:12:59,167
– When you feel this presence.
– Yes.

117
00:12:59,267 --> 00:13:07,213
Sometimes I get a big a shock too when my children and husband are coming.

118
00:13:09,506 --> 00:13:13,103
– The moment they come in.
– Yes.

119
00:13:19,513 --> 00:13:27,387
Sometimes if I sit on a sofa or something I feel there is something underneath.

120
00:13:27,651 --> 00:13:31,745
– That wants to pull you from underneath?

121
00:13:32,261 --> 00:13:37,104
– Yes. My father did many stupid things to me.

122
00:13:37,381 --> 00:13:41,985
If I was swimming in the water my father would take my legs and pulled me down.

123
00:13:42,224 --> 00:13:47,621
He swam behind me. You understand what I mean?

124
00:13:47,867 --> 00:13:56,581
When I was a child when I got to the water to swim in the swimming pool,

125
00:13:56,824 --> 00:14:06,546
my father swam behind me and grabbed my legs and pulled me under the water.

126
00:14:06,818 --> 00:14:10,658
I think I have shock from that too.

127
00:14:10,904 --> 00:14:17,058
And sometimes he took his hand on my nose and my mouth so I could not breathe.

128
00:14:17,551 --> 00:14:27,444
– Do you remember if as a child you were very angry and you expressed anger?

129
00:14:27,544 --> 00:14:31,407
You hit your sister, brother? Do you have a brother?

130
00:14:31,507 --> 00:14:35,855
– I have a sister.
– Do you remember hitting your sisters?

131
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:49,936
– No. When I was a child I was very nice, everybody had told me that.

132
00:14:50,187 --> 00:14:54,541
I was too nice. I didn’t show my own feeling.

133
00:14:55,056 --> 00:14:57,344
I was thinking very much about other people.

134
00:15:00,427 --> 00:15:02,987
I always liked children and people.

135
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:09,901
If my father did something to me I didn’t tell to my mother, I wanted to hide my father’s mistake.

136
00:15:10,144 --> 00:15:13,741
– What do you mean? Your father did something wrong?

137
00:15:13,984 --> 00:15:24,224
– Yes, for example sometimes if my mother was out he hit me.

138
00:15:27,146 --> 00:15:29,216
– And you didn’t tell.
– No.

139
00:15:29,867 --> 00:15:32,505
And when my mother was coming home I would like to tell her

140
00:15:32,752 --> 00:15:41,712
but I told myself it was a lie, that it was my mistake,

141
00:15:41,988 --> 00:15:46,832
I lie, so I didn’t tell anything to my mother.

142
00:15:48,627 --> 00:15:54,265
I have a tension today, sometimes if something happens I push it away.

143
00:15:56,068 --> 00:16:00,419
– You forget it?
– Yes, I forget it in the same time.

144
00:16:00,565 --> 00:16:08,345
– When it happens?
– Yes. Like I don’t want to see if something bad happens.

145
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:12,432
If it is something small sometimes I push it away.

146
00:16:13,712 --> 00:16:16,787
– But do you remember good things?

147
00:16:19,506 --> 00:16:24,377
– Yes, I remember good and bad.

148
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:31,267
I don’t mean I push it away completely but I like to look at the good things, not the bad things.

149
00:16:31,542 --> 00:16:37,304
– When you sleep does saliva comes out of your mouth?

150
00:16:37,584 --> 00:16:42,185
– Sometimes, not always.

151
00:16:42,424 --> 00:16:54,985
– Once a week, once a month, once a year?
– Maybe once a week.

152
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,064
– What are these pictures?

153
00:16:59,344 --> 00:17:01,348
– I’d like to show you the pictures of how I was

154
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:06,886
when I was inside my body and another picture, not inside my body.

155
00:17:06,986 --> 00:17:09,901
I don’t know if that helps.

156
00:17:10,367 --> 00:17:16,816
When I look at the picture I can see I am not inside my body.

157
00:17:17,067 --> 00:17:19,376
- But it’s a dark picture.

158
00:17:19,627 --> 00:17:27,056
What else from these drugs, except of hash and pot did you take?

159
00:17:27,307 --> 00:17:34,464
Cocaine, heroin?
– One time I took cocaine.

160
00:17:34,736 --> 00:17:41,136
– Only once? Sure?
– I am 100% sure.

161
00:17:41,626 --> 00:17:44,704
– Heroin?
– No.

162
00:17:50,086 --> 00:17:59,821
– So your sleep is good or you wake up? You see dreams?
– Sometimes I dream.

163
00:17:59,964 --> 00:18:03,617
– What?
– It is very different.

164
00:18:03,868 --> 00:18:08,737
Sometimes I dream about my feelings, what happened to me in the day,

165
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:15,906
about my feelings before in life, sometimes I dream something scary.

166
00:18:19,228 --> 00:18:33,308
Like the most scary movie. I think I am very sensitive.

167
00:18:38,192 --> 00:18:43,197
– Sensitive towards what?
– To everything.

168
00:18:43,297 --> 00:18:50,028
For example if I try something in life which is hard

169
00:18:50,552 --> 00:18:57,304
or if I see a scary movie it is very hard for me, I will remember that.

170
00:18:57,985 --> 00:19:02,092
– It’s very hard to get it out of your system.

171
00:19:02,348 --> 00:19:10,205
Do you sometimes see things or you see certain things and you see then happening as you thought?

172
00:19:11,547 --> 00:19:16,538
– Yes. Sometimes yes.

173
00:19:16,787 --> 00:19:27,824
One day I stood in a shop speaking with a man and I wanted to buy something

174
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:41,136
and I knew what will happen, what the man would say and in the 5 minutes everything I thought happened.

175
00:19:41,626 --> 00:19:45,742
– And everything happened as you thought?

176
00:19:45,994 --> 00:19:51,284
– Yes. But I don’t think about it like it’s something not normal.

177
00:19:51,384 --> 00:19:58,545
For me it was normal. I was not afraid or anything.

178
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:05,508
– Do you have animals in your house? Dog?

179
00:20:05,774 --> 00:20:11,385
– No. I had a cat before. I love cats.

180
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,868
– You also love animals in general?

181
00:20:16,268 --> 00:20:22,732
– I love them but I can be afraid, I am afraid of dogs.

182
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:27,067
I love them but I am afraid of some of them.

183
00:20:27,342 --> 00:20:29,132
– Are you afraid of dogs?
– Yes.

184
00:20:29,388 --> 00:20:33,467
– Very much?
– Not very much.

185
00:20:33,985 --> 00:20:38,862
– Do you swim in the sea? You like swimming?
– I like swimming.

186
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:48,316
– If you see the bottom with the goggles inside can you see?

187
00:20:48,316 --> 00:20:59,989
– I don’t like to go underwater. I cannot breathe.
– Fear of suffocation.

188
00:21:00,261 --> 00:21:09,269
– I am very much afraid to fly with an airplane. I am very very much afraid.

189
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:14,305
– Are you also afraid to be in a narrow place?
– Yes.

190
00:21:14,572 --> 00:21:19,592
– If it’s narrow...
- I feel I cannot breathe.

191
00:21:19,692 --> 00:21:28,144
– Do you take the lift if you have to go to the fifth floor or you go upstairs by the stairs?

192
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:32,407
– I am not so much afraid I take the lift.

193
00:21:32,507 --> 00:21:35,222
But I am afraid of the airplane.

194
00:21:35,468 --> 00:21:40,265
And I am afraid if I sit in high places.

195
00:21:40,434 --> 00:21:49,260
One day I went to a concert, there were some mountains and I was placed up

196
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:59,225
but I went down again and crawled down from the mountains, I was so afraid of height.

197
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,866
– Now you are afraid if you are in a balcony?
– I am very much afraid.

198
00:22:03,966 --> 00:22:08,148
– Afraid to look down?
– Yes.

199
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:11,906
– You have dizziness or you are just afraid?

200
00:22:12,173 --> 00:22:21,412
– I feel that maybe I want to jump. Maybe I cannot control myself.

201
00:22:29,092 --> 00:22:29,092
If I am in the balcony I feel I want to jump, I feel I cannot control myself.

202
00:22:30,108 --> 00:22:37,265
Sometimes something inside me would like to jump.

203
00:22:37,788 --> 00:22:42,388
– Impulse to jump from high places.

204
00:22:42,412 --> 00:22:47,148
 Do you feel fear of pain?
– Yes.

205
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:49,977
– Very much?
– Yes.

206
00:22:50,226 --> 00:22:57,308
– Any of these men that you had ever hit you?

207
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:01,566
– Yes but not very much.

208
00:23:01,666 --> 00:23:04,653
– Did you hit the man?
– Yes.

209
00:23:05,153 --> 00:23:07,985
– One time or more?

210
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:17,106
– The first one with whom I had the first child I hit him 5-6 times.

211
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:27,185
– And you were out of yourself. You could not control.

212
00:23:27,457 --> 00:23:32,305
– I felt he did something very bad to me.

213
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:37,643
So my feelings were very hurt so I got angry.

214
00:23:37,743 --> 00:23:45,325
– And you hit him with something or took a vase and hit him or with your hands?

215
00:23:45,497 --> 00:24:00,632
– With my hands.
– But do you have an impulse to kill somebody?

216
00:24:00,786 --> 00:24:08,869
Do something violent?
– Yes. I don’t always control myself.

217
00:24:09,144 --> 00:24:12,984
Now I live with my husband.

218
00:24:13,225 --> 00:24:21,669
If I feel that he will do something very bad to me I like to take something

219
00:24:21,944 --> 00:24:27,064
and throw it on the floor, I like to slam the door.

220
00:24:36,534 --> 00:24:48,586
– You were always having high sexual desire or it was normal or less than normal?

221
00:24:50,380 --> 00:25:01,392
– It has changed. The last 2 years I don’t have very much.

222
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:07,299
– When did you meet this man you are married now?

223
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:09,587
2-3 years ago?
– 4 years ago.

224
00:25:09,859 --> 00:25:12,812
– You stayed 2 years without being married.

225
00:25:12,912 --> 00:25:14,467
– No I was married at the same time.

226
00:25:14,706 --> 00:25:17,931
– So you are married for 4 years.
- Yes.

227
00:25:18,031 --> 00:25:28,271
– So you met him and after 3 months you married him.
– Yes.

228
00:25:30,831 --> 00:25:37,231
– You felt that this was a good husband? Why did you marry him?

229
00:25:39,063 --> 00:25:46,743
– Deep inside myself I don’t feel he is good for me.

230
00:25:46,984 --> 00:25:49,544
Something tells me he’s not good for me.

231
00:25:51,588 --> 00:25:57,224
And at that time I was alone in my life, I lost all my family,

232
00:25:57,747 --> 00:26:05,943
I had a very difficult time concerning everything and something inside me loved him.

233
00:26:06,043 --> 00:26:10,247
I have feelings for him and he has feelings for me

234
00:26:10,347 --> 00:26:18,106
but I want to use my sense I know inside myself that it is not good for both of us to be together.

235
00:26:18,281 --> 00:26:22,736
– Is your husband from Turkey?
– No he is from Jordan.

236
00:26:22,887 --> 00:26:28,107
And he is Muslim and I am not Muslim, I like to be free.

237
00:26:28,346 --> 00:26:32,461
I don’t have any religion, I don’t believe in hell.

238
00:26:32,704 --> 00:26:39,627
I believe nobody goes to hell. I believe hell is on earth, not when you die.

239
00:26:51,386 --> 00:26:55,226
I found a husband who pushed me down.

240
00:26:55,967 --> 00:26:58,727
– All the other husbands you mean?

241
00:27:02,195 --> 00:27:06,305
You want a husband that will suppress you?
– No, I don’t want it.

242
00:27:06,572 --> 00:27:08,663
But that is what happened to me.

243
00:27:08,904 --> 00:27:11,464
– Is this what happens every time?

244
00:27:11,738 --> 00:27:14,547
– Yes. I want a husband I can be free.

245
00:27:15,063 --> 00:27:19,144
I don’t want a husband to decide about me.

246
00:27:21,188 --> 00:27:25,028
– So he was a good husband for you.

247
00:27:25,544 --> 00:27:31,428
– No. In some ways he is good but I am not completely myself.

248
00:27:31,703 --> 00:27:35,784
I feel I lose my identity.

249
00:27:40,663 --> 00:27:46,788
If sometimes I am with people I try to look at them and then I become like them.

250
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:58,345
I try to be the best for the people around me.

251
00:27:58,864 --> 00:28:01,985
– Become what others want you to be.

252
00:28:02,085 --> 00:28:08,485
– Yes. And that is what makes me angry sometimes,

253
00:28:08,585 --> 00:28:13,844
that’s why maybe I start to break things

254
00:28:13,944 --> 00:28:21,134
because I try to do it but inside myself I don’t like it because I am not myself.

255
00:28:21,385 --> 00:28:23,945
I am sorry, I am getting angry with myself

256
00:28:24,184 --> 00:28:32,605
because I don’t like myself, I feel I lose my self-consciousness.

257
00:28:32,705 --> 00:28:37,482
– Self-esteem.
– I feel I lose that.

258
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:47,547
– But do you have confidence in yourself? Or you have no confidence?

259
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:54,224
– When I want to do something I have.

260
00:28:56,784 --> 00:29:02,691
Maybe I don’t have it completely but my mind is very strong.

261
00:29:03,184 --> 00:29:07,024
– Are you thinking a lot?
– Yes. I think very much.

262
00:29:07,301 --> 00:29:10,906
I think all the time, my head never stops thinking.

263
00:29:11,147 --> 00:29:17,186
– And you think about philosophical problems,

264
00:29:17,453 --> 00:29:23,068
why I am here, what is the world, why we are suffering?

265
00:29:23,343 --> 00:29:26,908
– Yes, I think about that.

266
00:29:34,768 --> 00:29:37,652
I think about why I did that to myself,

267
00:29:37,828 --> 00:29:44,748
I hope I was stronger so that I could survive and be myself again,

268
00:29:44,848 --> 00:29:50,134
I would not take people inside my life who are not good for me.

269
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:52,425
And I think very much about life.

270
00:29:52,767 --> 00:29:56,620
Why people are here, why things are like that?

271
00:29:56,868 --> 00:29:59,695
But sometimes I like it, sometimes I don’t.

272
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:04,300
In one way I like it because it’s important for me to think about it

273
00:30:04,815 --> 00:30:11,980
because this gives me something, I know now very much about people and life and many things.

274
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:18,280
– When you look somebody you understand whether he is a good or a bad person immediately?

275
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:29,907
– Yes. I know it but I don’t listen to it always.
– But you perceive it.

276
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:34,519
– And when I don’t listen to it I lose myself again.

277
00:30:37,072 --> 00:30:42,865
– If you don’t do according to what you feel then you are confused in your head.

278
00:30:42,965 --> 00:30:48,975
– And I am starting to lose myself. Because I don’t trust that feeling.

279
00:30:49,226 --> 00:30:52,025
– You go away from yourself.

280
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:58,700
– Always I go away from myself. If I trust or not trust... it is there.

281
00:30:58,948 --> 00:31:03,820
– But you never felt like you left your body totally

282
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:09,188
and you were roaming about in your dream or anything like that?

283
00:31:09,455 --> 00:31:13,546
– Yes, in my dreams I feel I leave my body.

284
00:31:13,646 --> 00:31:19,695
When I was a child I left my body every evening.

285
00:31:19,846 --> 00:31:25,580
I was very happy because I liked to go into that state.

286
00:31:25,828 --> 00:31:34,582
I went to the mountains, like Himalaya mountain, I was alone, I would like to do like that.

287
00:31:34,828 --> 00:31:41,904
Every evening.
– So, did you go to India eventually?

288
00:31:42,147 --> 00:31:44,707
– No, I never went.

289
00:31:44,974 --> 00:31:54,831
I see the picture of that time when I was a child and this is the place I went when I was a child.

290
00:31:56,626 --> 00:32:03,791
And I went every evening, I put myself on the bed and I was very happy

291
00:32:04,137 --> 00:32:07,987
because I knew now I will got to that place.

292
00:32:12,073 --> 00:32:19,024
– Did you have a guru?
– No.

293
00:32:19,234 --> 00:32:23,010
– You never went to a guru?
– No.

294
00:32:23,264 --> 00:32:31,970
– At the age of 13 you started using pot sometimes.
– Yes.

295
00:32:32,468 --> 00:32:35,810
– You had a strong character, you fought with your parents?

296
00:32:36,308 --> 00:32:40,666
How did your parents allow you to do this without problem?

297
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:50,660
– My father left me, he went to another country when I was 13.

298
00:32:50,906 --> 00:32:54,228
– So you felt free to do whatever you like.

299
00:32:54,753 --> 00:32:57,335
– Yes, I was free but I was sad too.

300
00:32:57,584 --> 00:33:04,166
I thought that maybe I started smoking hash because I started not to care about myself.

301
00:33:05,505 --> 00:33:09,776
And my mother was not strict with me.

302
00:33:10,027 --> 00:33:18,446
– When did you stop going out of your body and roaming about? What age?

303
00:33:22,304 --> 00:33:30,107
– When I was 13 I didn’t go out of my body anymore.

304
00:33:30,407 --> 00:33:35,266
I was missing that, I hope I could do that again but I couldn’t anymore.

305
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:42,428
– What age did you have sex for the time?
– When I was 13.

306
00:33:42,692 --> 00:33:51,008
– With a man, how old?
– I think 20.

307
00:33:51,108 --> 00:33:54,700
– And did you enjoy it or it was a bad experience?

308
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,132
– No, it was a bad experience.

309
00:33:56,386 --> 00:33:58,692
– Did he force you?
– No.

310
00:33:58,946 --> 00:34:01,252
– You wanted to experiment.

311
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:05,092
– Yes, but I don’t know why because at that time I had a boyfriend

312
00:34:05,346 --> 00:34:10,112
and I loved that boyfriend and he wanted to sleep with me

313
00:34:10,212 --> 00:34:16,888
but I did not wanted to, I was very angry at him if he wanted to sleep with.

314
00:34:18,268 --> 00:34:24,171
I felt that he would do something bad for me if he wanted to.

315
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:27,706
After that I slept with somebody I didn’t like.

316
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:31,056
And I knew I would lose my boyfriend that I loved.

317
00:34:31,307 --> 00:34:37,174
– But you did it.
– Yes.

318
00:34:37,198 --> 00:34:43,990
 I was surprised, I didn’t like to think about sex or anything.

319
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:51,170
– Your father had done something that made you a little bit...

320
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:57,306
- No, all my life when I started having problems

321
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:00,700
I was thinking that maybe my father has done something bad for me

322
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,353
because I feel it, but I don’t remember.

323
00:35:04,624 --> 00:35:07,184
But I feel he did something.

324
00:35:07,444 --> 00:35:16,385
And even now I can get angry if I think about sex or if my husband does something to me I can be angry.

325
00:35:16,665 --> 00:35:21,264
– If your husband wants to have sex with you,

326
00:35:21,785 --> 00:35:26,135
 you become angry?
– Sometimes.

327
00:35:26,384 --> 00:35:30,465
– Because you don’t want and you cannot tell him that you don’t want.

328
00:35:30,745 --> 00:35:35,585
– I tell him that I don’t want.
– Now, you tell him.

329
00:35:36,006 --> 00:35:39,617
– Sometimes maybe I can sleep with him, even if I don’t want,

330
00:35:39,868 --> 00:35:43,708
because I don’t want to make any trouble.

331
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:50,413
But sometimes I like to sleep with him if he is nice to me and we are close to each other

332
00:35:50,664 --> 00:35:55,148
but I don’t like to sleep with anybody I feel I am not close to.

333
00:35:56,985 --> 00:36:11,257
But I can be very angry sometimes especially if somebody touches my ears.

334
00:36:11,506 --> 00:36:14,582
I feel I want to kill them.

335
00:36:14,828 --> 00:36:20,226
– If they touch your ear?
– Yes, inside my ears.

336
00:36:20,326 --> 00:36:36,588
– I feel my father has done something to me I didn’t like, he did many things I didn’t like.

337
00:36:36,845 --> 00:36:39,417
– Like kissing you in your ear?

338
00:36:39,666 --> 00:36:44,786
– No, but I don’t remember exactly.

339
00:36:45,302 --> 00:36:50,147
I remember many things but I don’t remember something about sex.

340
00:36:51,948 --> 00:36:55,823
– He hit you many times?
– Yes.

341
00:36:56,333 --> 00:37:02,548
– Was he a violent man? He is still alive?
– Yes.

342
00:37:02,648 --> 00:37:10,692
– Is he in America?
– No, he is in Spain. He is from Spain.

343
00:37:10,846 --> 00:37:17,805
I don’t think he is violent but my mother is not easy too.

344
00:37:17,905 --> 00:37:32,132
She likes to dominate, to decide about people very much.

345
00:37:35,408 --> 00:37:43,388
And she drives people crazy. I can understand my father now.

346
00:37:43,906 --> 00:37:52,612
My father is a nice man. He is not a bad person.

347
00:37:52,866 --> 00:37:59,505
He does some things stupid but I don’t think that he knows what he is doing.

348
00:38:01,826 --> 00:38:10,786
– In your room, where you sleep, you leave all the lights on or you leave some light?

349
00:38:16,145 --> 00:38:22,228
– Between a little and full.

350
00:38:33,048 --> 00:38:41,085
When I was a child my mother was afraid of many things too.

351
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:49,386
And my mother was telling me things she still says that if you do this, that will happen to you.

352
00:38:49,904 --> 00:38:55,265
If you go to the street maybe somebody will rape you or kill you.

353
00:38:55,786 --> 00:39:02,186
And she shows me the newspapers saying that many bad things are happening in the world.

354
00:39:02,455 --> 00:39:07,824
And I was not strong when I was a child but I’m stronger now

355
00:39:08,065 --> 00:39:12,085
and I haven’t seen my mother for 4 years.

356
00:39:12,185 --> 00:39:14,382
Because I want to get away from her.

357
00:39:14,625 --> 00:39:21,227
I don’t want to hear every day, you get up every morning and hear all that.

358
00:39:24,108 --> 00:39:31,265
I tried to help myself, I tried to get away from that and think positive about life

359
00:39:31,532 --> 00:39:36,667
but that’s difficult if somebody speaks to you like this all the time.

360
00:39:43,421 --> 00:39:53,571
I am not strong enough not to care, I am so sensitive.

361
00:39:54,851 --> 00:40:03,447
– Tell me if you are alone in the house you feel better or worse?

362
00:40:03,547 --> 00:40:11,391
Do you want somebody, especially in the night? You will feel good to be alone?

363
00:40:11,491 --> 00:40:17,104
– No. I wait for my husband to come home before I sleep.

364
00:40:17,627 --> 00:40:21,631
Sometimes I don’t even like to go to the toilet

365
00:40:21,731 --> 00:40:27,867
and sometimes I need to go to the toilet but I stay in the room.

366
00:40:29,265 --> 00:40:44,772
– How is your thirst? How much you drink? Normal, very much, very little?

367
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:56,292
– It’s hot here and it’s very much now but in Denmark it’s normal I think.

368
00:41:01,666 --> 00:41:04,988
– In your country you drink cold water,

369
00:41:05,252 --> 00:41:08,477
 very cold water?
– Yes.

370
00:41:08,577 --> 00:41:15,492
– From the fridge?
– No, I don’t put it in the fridge.

371
00:41:18,817 --> 00:41:29,826
– Do you take a lot of salt in your food?
– No. Normal.

372
00:41:30,337 --> 00:41:34,105
My mother used to give me very much salt as a child.

373
00:41:34,352 --> 00:41:40,628
She got very much salt in the food. And she gave it to me when I was a child.

374
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:48,580
Because of it I used my mind I studied very much what is good for the body

375
00:41:48,826 --> 00:41:51,904
and I know now salt is not good so I stopped.

376
00:41:52,148 --> 00:42:02,044
– When did you stop?
– Maybe 6-7 years ago.

377
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:07,508
– By that time you used to like very salty things?

378
00:42:10,586 --> 00:42:14,944
– I think I ate it because of my mother.

379
00:42:15,188 --> 00:42:19,810
– So, when you stopped, when you put less you had no problem.

380
00:42:20,308 --> 00:42:22,868
You still like the food.
– Yes.

381
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:27,026
– You have your menses now?

382
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:30,541
– How old are you now?
– 33.

383
00:42:30,784 --> 00:42:32,587
– And you have your menses?
– Yes.

384
00:42:32,826 --> 00:42:35,184
– A lot of blood, normal or...?

385
00:42:35,425 --> 00:42:44,924
– I think there is a lot of blood the first 2-3 days.

386
00:42:45,068 --> 00:42:48,506
– Clear blood or clots?

387
00:42:50,061 --> 00:42:59,021
 – Sometimes pieces. Not before but now there are some pieces.

388
00:42:59,164 --> 00:43:06,128
– Do you remember as a child did you use to have nose bleeds?

389
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:19,010
– I think so, yes. I remember yes, but I don’t know if they were many.

390
00:43:21,824 --> 00:43:27,706
– Sweets? Do you like sweets, chocolate?

391
00:43:36,148 --> 00:43:40,770
– Sometimes it’s difficult for me to know what I like and what not

392
00:43:41,024 --> 00:43:43,728
because I don’t listen to myself.

393
00:43:43,828 --> 00:43:47,545
If like something sweet I don’t eat it because it’s not good for me.

394
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:50,352
I worked with myself for many years.

395
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:58,308
Before I liked sweets but I know what is good for me now and what is not.

396
00:43:58,547 --> 00:44:03,667
So if my body says I want something my mind say no at the same time.

397
00:44:03,939 --> 00:44:09,452
– Did you ever were infected with gonorrhea?
– No.

398
00:44:09,552 --> 00:44:11,905
– Sure? You had no infection,

399
00:44:12,172 --> 00:44:16,507
 but you remember you took antibiotics for that?
– No.

400
00:44:16,782 --> 00:44:24,007
– You never took antibiotics?
– Yes, but for infection here.

401
00:44:30,841 --> 00:44:40,506
– At what age?
– When I was a child, I don’t remember when.

402
00:44:43,852 --> 00:44:49,742
But from 10 years old I started getting very much.

403
00:44:50,508 --> 00:44:58,211
– Until?
-- Until I was 22-23.

404
00:44:58,709 --> 00:45:01,269
– You took antibiotics constantly?

405
00:45:01,441 --> 00:45:05,946
– Not constantly but very much because I always had an infection here.

406
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:11,585
– But did you go to the doctor?
– Yes, my mother took me to the doctor.

407
00:45:11,865 --> 00:45:21,584
– Did they say it was lupus this infection?
– I don’t understand that.

408
00:45:23,385 --> 00:45:30,544
– What did they say it was?
– It was just an infection inside here.

409
00:45:33,104 --> 00:45:42,826
And I have an infection sometimes too if I go to the toilet.

410
00:45:43,585 --> 00:45:47,705
– You know when you go to the toilet and have pain.

411
00:45:47,946 --> 00:45:55,868
I don’t know the word in English.
– Cystitis.

412
00:45:56,897 --> 00:46:10,705
– Yes, I have infection in the urine and here.

413
00:46:10,977 --> 00:46:14,306
These 2 problems I have very much.

414
00:46:14,545 --> 00:46:18,385
– But lately did you have any of these problems?

415
00:46:18,657 --> 00:46:24,785
What was the last time, at 22 when you were getting antibiotics?

416
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:34,546
– No, maybe when I was pregnant maybe 1.5 year ago.

417
00:46:34,687 --> 00:46:42,253
That had to do with the urinary infection.

418
00:46:47,624 --> 00:46:54,052
Sometimes I feel I have an infection again but I take very much water now.

419
00:46:54,318 --> 00:47:01,263
If I feel it now I drink maybe 3 lt. of water and then it goes away.

420
00:47:01,773 --> 00:47:05,792
Because I don’t like to take antibiotics.

421
00:47:05,892 --> 00:47:11,624
Before my mother made me to take antibiotics every month.

422
00:47:12,932 --> 00:47:19,586
Do you want to know what I wrote here?
– Tell me.

423
00:47:21,105 --> 00:47:30,337
– It’s difficult for me to trust people sometimes.

424
00:47:30,852 --> 00:47:33,905
– Do you trust me?
– Yes.

425
00:47:34,428 --> 00:47:40,452
– Can you say no? Would you say no in case you couldn’t?

426
00:47:40,706 --> 00:47:48,132
– Yes. It’s difficult for me to say no but...

427
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:56,857
- Are you suspicious about people?
– Yes.

428
00:47:58,902 --> 00:48:14,262
If somebody does something to me and I feel is wrong,

429
00:48:19,497 --> 00:48:25,507
for example I like somebody and that person makes a mistake,

430
00:48:25,782 --> 00:48:31,693
just one mistake can make me go inside myself, like I’m not open.

431
00:48:31,944 --> 00:48:34,504
– And detach.

432
00:48:34,748 --> 00:48:40,386
- No, I’m not like that because I know myself now but that’s my first reaction.

433
00:48:40,653 --> 00:48:45,774
But now I know myself and I know who I am so I tell myself don’t be like that

434
00:48:46,025 --> 00:48:47,544
but that’s what happens to me.

435
00:48:49,347 --> 00:48:57,027
I control myself very much too, I am not spontaneous.

436
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:08,547
Maybe sometimes I am spontaneous but that’s not very much.

437
00:49:09,304 --> 00:49:16,745
Most of the time I control myself.
– Do you want to control everything?

438
00:49:20,824 --> 00:49:28,014
– About what happens in life? About people?\

439
00:49:29,784 --> 00:49:45,667
Yes, I like to control, sometimes and many times I like not to control.

440
00:49:45,825 --> 00:49:48,906
– You like to be free.

441
00:49:49,006 --> 00:50:05,815
– Yes. Sometimes I feel I miss something inside myself

442
00:50:07,606 --> 00:50:15,445
and I need other people to make me happy sometimes.

443
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:18,764
I feel they have something I don’t have

444
00:50:18,864 --> 00:50:24,226
but at the same time I feel they take something from me when I am with them.

445
00:50:24,506 --> 00:50:35,532
I feel I want them to give me something but in the end I feel emptier sometimes when I am alone.

446
00:50:35,688 --> 00:50:39,105
It’s best for me if I don’t go.

447
00:50:44,748 --> 00:50:51,148
But at the same time I feel I need very much love from other people.

448
00:50:51,387 --> 00:50:57,548
I need somebody to give me love. Sometimes I feel I just like to be a baby.

449
00:50:58,062 --> 00:51:03,425
I don’t like people to tell me what to do.

450
00:51:04,972 --> 00:51:13,422
If somebody I love is bad to me,

451
00:51:14,927 --> 00:51:23,805
for example if they tell me to go away from them I’m getting very sad, not just a little.

452
00:51:23,905 --> 00:51:31,067
I start not to care about myself and think about killing myself or take cocaine.

453
00:51:31,242 --> 00:51:37,985
I am thinking of doing something bad to myself if somebody I love does something bad to me.

454
00:51:39,532 --> 00:51:47,342
But that has just happened a little because I come back quickly.

455
00:51:47,585 --> 00:52:02,427
That’s the first reaction. I have a difficult time if I am very busy in my life.

456
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:04,648
Not before but when I got sick,

457
00:52:04,748 --> 00:52:11,148
sometimes I feel I have something to do in life that makes me nervous.

458
00:52:12,667 --> 00:52:21,902
Sometimes I feel like just getting up in the morning is hard for me

459
00:52:22,145 --> 00:52:36,987
because sometimes life is very busy and you cannot say stop, I don’t want to.

460
00:52:37,262 --> 00:52:42,625
Life wants something from you all the time and sometimes it’s difficult for me to follow

461
00:52:42,892 --> 00:52:48,012
because I need peace very much.

462
00:52:49,548 --> 00:52:53,902
When my father left me and went to Spain,

463
00:52:54,145 --> 00:53:01,068
when I started to think if my father did something to me when I was a child,

464
00:53:01,582 --> 00:53:09,505
I spoke to my mother but she pushed me away like I am crazy.

465
00:53:09,772 --> 00:53:11,722
She didn’t want to listen to me.

466
00:53:11,822 --> 00:53:14,255
So I feel all my life people push me away,

467
00:53:14,506 --> 00:53:18,860
nobody listens to me and they just leave me alone.

468
00:53:19,108 --> 00:53:23,577
When I got far for 4 years ago they haven’t called me, not even one time.

469
00:53:23,826 --> 00:53:28,428
They just left me and they know I am very sick and I have a very hard time.

470
00:53:28,946 --> 00:53:35,346
If I open my mouth and speak about my feelings they are pushing it down again,

471
00:53:35,862 --> 00:53:39,186
my father and my mother.

472
00:53:42,508 --> 00:53:45,827
– Ok, thank you.

473
00:53:46,866 --> 00:53:56,387
I allowed her to be here so in case you want to ask an extra question you can do it.

474
00:53:56,626 --> 00:54:01,231
I asked her because Alice told me is she still smoking;

475
00:54:01,507 --> 00:54:10,706
she says no smoke, no cigarettes, no pot, no hash, nothing of that type.

476
00:54:12,251 --> 00:54:17,106
So I believe her, she is telling the truth.

477
00:54:17,378 --> 00:54:22,226
I scared her so much in the beginning!

478
00:54:22,498 --> 00:54:31,704
That she will not easily tell something not true.

479
00:54:32,366 --> 00:54:38,004
It’s our responsibility now, she gave everything about herself.

480
00:54:38,104 --> 00:54:41,684
And she gave it amazingly well.

481
00:54:41,784 --> 00:54:47,184
I did not expect when I saw her that she would be able to describe

482
00:54:47,427 --> 00:54:49,987
what is going on inside her.

483
00:54:51,024 --> 00:55:01,947
Because the first thing I could see was that she was being using pot.

484
00:55:02,222 --> 00:55:07,621
She has been using hashish and these drugs

485
00:55:07,867 --> 00:55:16,347
that detach the etheric body from the physical one.

486
00:55:16,865 --> 00:55:23,788
And this detachment, when it happens it can stay forever.

487
00:55:24,027 --> 00:55:34,497
And it causes a state of great panic and fear.

488
00:55:36,546 --> 00:55:43,708
Those who remember my lecture on Cann-i.,

489
00:55:43,855 --> 00:55:52,145
how I described the fear that develops out of this detachment of the body.

490
00:55:52,668 --> 00:55:58,306
Now she feels she has this state permanently.

491
00:55:58,445 --> 00:56:01,826
Let’s understand what has happened to her.

492
00:56:02,806 --> 00:56:05,668
She says very important things, for instance,

493
00:56:05,943 --> 00:56:13,623
when I was a child I was leaving my body happily, going to nice places

494
00:56:13,864 --> 00:56:21,065
and coming back and I was expecting the night time

495
00:56:21,304 --> 00:56:26,424
when I would leave the body and roam about and I was very happy.

496
00:56:27,214 --> 00:56:38,734
Now, she says, I am detached from my body but I am totally invalid.

497
00:56:38,985 --> 00:56:43,854
I live constantly in fear, in that state

498
00:56:44,105 --> 00:56:55,864
where I am paralyzed and you could not see the full force of her problem

499
00:56:56,144 --> 00:57:03,544
because of something which I did and I will explain it.

500
00:57:03,824 --> 00:57:12,684
I made her feel comfortable in spite of the fact I was very aggressive in the beginning.

501
00:57:12,784 --> 00:57:21,084
I said don’t tell me a lie otherwise... But I made her feel comfortable.

502
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:29,644
I just listened with great attention to what she had to say.

503
00:57:29,787 --> 00:57:38,185
That’s why she opened up eventually and was able to describe what is happening inside her mind.

504
00:57:38,424 --> 00:57:43,183
Otherwise she would feel very confused,

505
00:57:43,426 --> 00:57:48,546
full of fears and full of this state of detachment.

506
00:57:50,344 --> 00:58:02,146
But how this state from pleasant detachment became unpleasant, sick detachment?

507
00:58:05,468 --> 00:58:22,626
The yogis which practice meditation they practice in order to get out of their bodies

508
00:58:22,865 --> 00:58:33,628
and go to these astral planes where the feelings are fantastic.

509
00:58:33,728 --> 00:58:40,292
It’s the upper place of the astral world where

510
00:58:40,546 --> 00:58:51,025
what is happening is quite spiritual and therefore pleasant.

511
00:58:53,585 --> 00:59:03,586
So what this little yogi was doing, she was a little yogi,

512
00:59:03,825 --> 00:59:10,748
6-8 years old who came out of her body,

513
00:59:11,012 --> 00:59:17,666
left the body and could go and meet anybody she liked if she put in her mind

514
00:59:17,905 --> 00:59:26,865
I want to meet my friends she could go and meet her friends in whatever country or whatever place.

515
00:59:27,133 --> 00:59:33,788
This is the detachment which happens in every one of us during the night when we sleep.

516
00:59:35,332 --> 00:59:43,505
Every one of us leaves the body and goes accordingly to some plane.

517
00:59:43,777 --> 00:59:48,827
Now why we are not going to very pleasant places,

518
00:59:49,091 --> 00:59:58,222
why our dreams are not very pleasant is because our conscience is not clean any more

519
00:59:58,465 --> 01:00:01,962
 like a child’s conscience.

520
01:00:02,062 --> 01:00:09,742
That is what prevents us from coming to a dream world in the night

521
01:00:10,005 --> 01:00:27,171
which will always be a pleasant situation. She was given a gift because this is a gift.

522
01:00:27,425 --> 01:00:44,964
It is a kind of very refined regulation between the astral and the physical body.

523
01:00:45,107 --> 01:00:55,466
If that regulation is absolutely correct then somebody can leave with his astral body

524
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:59,965
and come back with no problem.

525
01:01:00,065 --> 01:01:08,301
And this is attained by people who have a clear conscience

526
01:01:08,544 --> 01:01:13,421
and can leave their body without a problem.

527
01:01:14,426 --> 01:01:21,344
Because if they don’t have a clear conscience the moment they leave their body

528
01:01:21,616 --> 01:01:37,108
they come into contact with lower spiritual world where they can see aggressive situations.

529
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:44,190
She says now my dreams are grand guignol,

530
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:47,985
she did not understand what it is but this is what she meant

531
01:01:48,257 --> 01:01:55,172
when she says her dreams are the most terrible dreams sometimes.

532
01:01:55,937 --> 01:02:01,572
And this is very teaching for all of us to understand

533
01:02:01,765 --> 01:02:06,675
because most of you I believe you are dealing with patient

534
01:02:06,946 --> 01:02:12,665
and you have to have the correct knowledge to advise correctly the person

535
01:02:12,921 --> 01:02:15,126
 who comes to be treated by you.

536
01:02:15,226 --> 01:02:19,703
So you have to know and understand all these working of the human body.

537
01:02:19,944 --> 01:02:28,389
And when she was a child and was pure in her conscience without any fear

538
01:02:28,705 --> 01:02:37,386
she could leave the body and go to the uppermost astral areas where there is no fear.

539
01:02:37,625 --> 01:02:42,506
But what happened in her life?

540
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:52,228
Her father grabs her and pulls her in the water

541
01:02:54,140 --> 01:03:02,992
and this is an experience of a child by the father, a terrific fear.

542
01:03:02,992 --> 01:03:10,948
That my father almost drowned me. Certain other things are happened

543
01:03:11,187 --> 01:03:20,147
and at the age of 10 she starts taking antibiotics.

544
01:03:20,419 --> 01:03:26,447
Had some shocks one after another, I expect some other shocks as well,

545
01:03:26,547 --> 01:03:38,639
as you may also understand from what she says and finally at the age of 13 she is a liberated woman,

546
01:03:40,265 --> 01:03:53,508
she explores the world but which world? Not the uppermost classes.

547
01:03:55,468 --> 01:04:06,547
She finds some friends and she describes very vividly how they sat around

548
01:04:06,819 --> 01:04:11,939
and smoked pot and had a good time.

549
01:04:12,185 --> 01:04:20,112
I believe 37% of you had some similar experience.

550
01:04:33,145 --> 01:04:41,872
Once I put this question in California to my students, most of them were MDs,

551
01:04:42,165 --> 01:04:51,215
I said who has smoked hashish and I saw all hands raising.

552
01:04:52,228 --> 01:04:56,335
Then I asked who did not, no hand!

553
01:04:59,146 --> 01:05:02,368
It’s something very strange to me

554
01:05:02,468 --> 01:05:18,585
because at the time I was in India in 1960’s I had no idea of these things

555
01:05:18,585 --> 01:05:22,575
and there I met some Americans that had already come

556
01:05:22,826 --> 01:05:31,268
and they were trying to persuade me to join their company.

557
01:05:31,435 --> 01:05:37,420
I said forget it, not for me! And you should not do it also!

558
01:05:37,668 --> 01:05:40,985
It was a big debate and I don’t know if I won

559
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:46,380
but I never took any drugs because in India I was very happy,

560
01:05:46,528 --> 01:05:55,065
why should I take any drugs if someone is happy... to become happier?

561
01:05:56,106 --> 01:06:04,025
But you see her life, the father left etc.

562
01:06:08,388 --> 01:06:20,565
What is clear is that she is born as a little yogi with a possibility to read minds.

563
01:06:20,665 --> 01:06:22,388
She could read the future of the people,

564
01:06:22,534 --> 01:06:31,865
she could go to the astral world and could advise by giving them fantastic information.

565
01:06:33,935 --> 01:06:44,426
She went to communicate with people of her age that they were using pot etc.

566
01:06:44,665 --> 01:06:49,295
and something which for me is also unbelievable,

567
01:06:49,546 --> 01:06:57,988
at the age of 13 she also experienced sex in the way she wanted.

568
01:06:58,255 --> 01:07:02,095
Many times in my classes I have said don’t do that

569
01:07:02,346 --> 01:07:08,228
because it would bring you to a state of mental disorder

570
01:07:08,495 --> 01:07:17,945
because the sexual thing is not a simple.

571
01:07:19,225 --> 01:07:26,905
If you do it it means you have to separate your emotional body from your physical one.

572
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:36,185
So you let your physical body have some pleasure while the emotional body is looking.

573
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:41,388
Sometimes you may have the experience when you are having sex you are looking upon

574
01:07:41,627 --> 01:07:43,182
and say what am I doing now.

575
01:07:43,292 --> 01:07:45,924
This is the time when you have sex without love,

576
01:07:46,024 --> 01:07:52,104
without connection, without intermingling with each other.

577
01:07:53,907 --> 01:08:02,618
If you do that you separate your emotions because the pain is so much.

578
01:08:02,867 --> 01:08:13,864
If you let your emotions inside your body you will feel so much the pain of this experience.

579
01:08:14,138 --> 01:08:20,024
It’s a painful experience if you have sex with someone you don’t love.

580
01:08:20,814 --> 01:08:25,324
If you only want to have the pleasure experience of the physical body

581
01:08:25,424 --> 01:08:28,985
you have to separate and this is what she did.

582
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:36,664
First come the antibiotics that started breaking down the organism,

583
01:08:36,944 --> 01:08:47,384
then at the age of 13 she is already damaged by quite a lot of antibiotics and then comes the pot.

584
01:08:49,426 --> 01:08:54,824
It separates the astral from the physical body.

585
01:08:55,098 --> 01:08:58,704
You take a lot of hash or marijuana,

586
01:09:00,745 --> 01:09:06,104
and your body is separated and we know this very well

587
01:09:06,376 --> 01:09:12,549
because we know the fear of insanity which is produced by Cann-i.

588
01:09:13,065 --> 01:09:25,349
You will see our repertories. Fear of insanity Cann-i. is one for the main remedies.

589
01:09:25,624 --> 01:09:28,608
Actually she was damaging herself first

590
01:09:28,708 --> 01:09:35,108
because she did not know she was taking antibiotics then taking drugs,

591
01:09:35,375 --> 01:09:41,260
separating the body even more but what happened to her?

592
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:57,900
I mean here you have a system, a human being which is regulated to come in and out quite easily.

593
01:09:58,148 --> 01:10:11,980
You don’t need too much interference to block the regulation and leave it half-open.

594
01:10:16,868 --> 01:10:27,108
Her astral body remained forever not in and not out.

595
01:10:27,247 --> 01:10:34,265
She lost all her energy, power and feelings. All are gone.

596
01:10:34,512 --> 01:10:42,979
When you have the impression of her, I wanted to show you the picture before,

597
01:10:43,225 --> 01:10:46,308
she was a totally different person.

598
01:10:46,819 --> 01:10:52,947
She herself looks at this and says who am I?

599
01:10:53,219 --> 01:10:55,268
Am I this? Have I become this?

600
01:10:57,065 --> 01:11:08,854
She has become the ghost of herself and she is dealing with a ghost world now.

601
01:11:08,854 --> 01:11:13,705
A ghost coming and staying behind my back.

602
01:11:17,545 --> 01:11:30,105
This fine regulation is damaged, very severely.

603
01:11:32,426 --> 01:11:39,588
But in that state, I’ve told especially in my lecture of Sep.,

604
01:11:40,106 --> 01:11:48,300
that Sep. are looking also like her, not exactly, but almost.

605
01:11:48,905 --> 01:11:59,545
They have no feelings but they can perceive what you are thinking and what your feelings are

606
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:03,660
because they are detached.

607
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:11,065
It’s very interesting, the moment that you are detached,

608
01:12:12,868 --> 01:12:22,052
that means I am not connected and I can see objectively,

609
01:12:22,206 --> 01:12:27,326
if I love somebody there is no possibility I can objectively see my wife,

610
01:12:27,426 --> 01:12:36,066
my girlfriend or child, I think it’s the nicest child, the cleverest,

611
01:12:36,305 --> 01:12:43,492
I have a dog and it’s the cleverest dog.

612
01:12:45,537 --> 01:12:56,785
My dog has been killed and for one day I was out of function,

613
01:12:56,857 --> 01:13:04,637
totally and I had to take Nat-m., this is a confession to be able to functional again,

614
01:13:04,737 --> 01:13:08,305
because I was attached to the dog.

615
01:13:09,857 --> 01:13:15,128
Everyone who was coming to my house, I was like look what my dog is doing!

616
01:13:15,292 --> 01:13:23,068
You don’t see objectively. You don’t see, you don’t take distance.

617
01:13:23,343 --> 01:13:31,966
The moment that you become very detached then you can really see the truth,

618
01:13:32,066 --> 01:13:36,597
what the others are thinking and their feeling.

619
01:13:36,697 --> 01:13:40,786
She has that, she can see that.

620
01:13:41,027 --> 01:13:44,377
But what is the problem? It’s a good thing.

621
01:13:44,626 --> 01:13:50,262
Because she does not know how to close this. It’s permanently open.

622
01:13:50,508 --> 01:13:57,567
It’s like having no skin to protect you from people touching you.

623
01:13:57,667 --> 01:14:02,146
They touch a wound if you don’t have a skin.

624
01:14:02,385 --> 01:14:05,817
This is what is happening with her.

625
01:14:06,066 --> 01:14:12,707
Therefore, unless we understand this and we have this kind of analysis

626
01:14:13,228 --> 01:14:22,088
how we can interfere with her body in order to bring back this regulation

627
01:14:22,188 --> 01:14:32,264
within the physical body and the connection so we can bring her back to life.

628
01:14:32,783 --> 01:14:38,413
If you ask her she says I am not living, I don’t know how I am living.

629
01:14:41,506 --> 01:14:47,652
Don’t see her eyes when I spoke to her because she became more and more alive.

630
01:14:48,145 --> 01:14:59,426
If I was detached and not showing love to her you would see a ghost talking.

631
01:15:02,497 --> 01:15:13,506
But since I understand these things I am not needing this kind of observation

632
01:15:14,017 --> 01:15:23,205
and when I need to do that sometimes I am totally detached but with her it would be the worst thing,

633
01:15:25,026 --> 01:15:27,461
you have to really show that you are interested

634
01:15:27,707 --> 01:15:34,107
and her story is interesting for everyone of you I believe.

635
01:15:34,371 --> 01:15:49,221
Am I right? Listen the difference between connection and detachment.

636
01:15:49,731 --> 01:15:59,184
I asked a question, I said do you think that I am right.

637
01:15:59,461 --> 01:16:02,785
Do you think this case is interested?

638
01:16:03,024 --> 01:16:12,261
I am absolutely sure 99.9% find the case interesting,

639
01:16:12,507 --> 01:16:23,781
what I hear is mmmh and not from everybody, about 30%.

640
01:16:24,027 --> 01:16:30,945
Who is this 30%? Those who are in contact with mequite a lot.

641
01:16:31,184 --> 01:16:37,091
The others have a detachment saying what is he talking about.

642
01:16:40,421 --> 01:16:52,705
I can see some of you intellectualize inside yourself whether I am right or not

643
01:16:52,944 --> 01:16:54,647
but the case is interesting!

644
01:16:54,747 --> 01:17:00,385
So you say yes the case is very interesting, that’s all.

645
01:17:02,727 --> 01:17:14,211
Because in our society we are half mad. Crazy.

646
01:17:14,704 --> 01:17:22,661
Our western ‘civilization’  has made us half-crazy.

647
01:17:22,907 --> 01:17:30,064
That’s why 70% of the American people have a psychotherapist

648
01:17:30,487 --> 01:17:36,741
and now it’s coming this fashion to Europe, even to Greece.

649
01:17:37,251 --> 01:17:42,371
It’s unbelievable! Oh you have to see a psychologist!

650
01:17:44,421 --> 01:17:51,067
Because they cannot communicate anymore, cannot give love to each other,

651
01:17:51,585 --> 01:17:59,165
cannot do the natural thing that a human beings do in their relationships.

652
01:17:59,265 --> 01:18:06,668
You detach too much and you pay the price. And not this price.

653
01:18:06,907 --> 01:18:14,107
This is a big price because she broke all the laws.

654
01:18:16,905 --> 01:18:26,561
A woman being 30, 40 or 50 and may not have sex and it is better if she had,

655
01:18:26,661 --> 01:18:31,404
forced herself with somebody she does not love.

656
01:18:31,504 --> 01:18:40,226
Say it my personal craziness what I have seen is that this is what happens.

657
01:18:40,465 --> 01:18:46,865
When I see the stress when it comes I see that they have damaged themselves many times

658
01:18:46,965 --> 01:18:53,265
by pushing themselves with a man who they don’t love

659
01:18:53,537 --> 01:19:00,945
and therefore I have this syndrome which I call “Husband syndrome”.

660
01:19:01,586 --> 01:19:10,428
Who knows the husband syndrome? Not too many, it doesn’t matter.

661
01:19:10,692 --> 01:19:22,466
Now, she has a problem because she lives with a husband with whom she is not in love also.

662
01:19:22,705 --> 01:19:28,612
Maybe she is not in love because she is not feeling well.

663
01:19:28,866 --> 01:19:34,232
Is my body well so I can enjoy having sex with him?

664
01:19:35,012 --> 01:19:41,666
After your remedy maybe she will enjoy more being with her husband, I don’t know,

665
01:19:41,805 --> 01:19:49,757
but at this moment it’s still negative for us to live with somebody

666
01:19:49,857 --> 01:19:54,658
she says she is not in love with but is a nice man. This is husband syndrome.

667
01:19:55,156 --> 01:20:01,304
He is a nice man, I can tolerate him, I love him because he gives me security,

668
01:20:01,556 --> 01:20:08,738
he is in the bank, the manager, he has social status,

669
01:20:09,231 --> 01:20:19,624
he is intelligent but does not excite me emotionally and sexually.

670
01:20:20,904 --> 01:20:28,344
Women are in trouble when they do that.

671
01:20:30,665 --> 01:20:36,983
These are women which are faithful to their husbands!

672
01:20:37,124 --> 01:20:40,948
They are not playing tricks. Ok, I don’t like my husband.

673
01:20:41,294 --> 01:20:51,545
There are other cases that will have on the side somebody else who satisfies them on this level.

674
01:20:51,792 --> 01:20:59,225
These particular women who develop husband syndrome become sick, permanently,

675
01:20:59,472 --> 01:21:02,185
having from one syndrome to another.

676
01:21:03,312 --> 01:21:09,064
You cure one set of symptoms and then they come with another set of symptoms.

677
01:21:10,908 --> 01:21:19,868
That’s why it’s very difficult to cure a woman who lives with a man with whom she is not in love.

678
01:21:23,213 --> 01:21:37,308
Now we come to the real problem because as you heard,

679
01:21:37,572 --> 01:21:40,625
for those who understand a little bit of M.M.

680
01:21:40,897 --> 01:21:52,145
When I see her I know she has taken drugs, marijuana. She is detached.

681
01:21:53,187 --> 01:21:58,828
If you go and see Cann-i. my lecture is exactly that.

682
01:21:59,097 --> 01:22:07,053
Further than that she is having fear of losing her mind, fear of insanity.

683
01:22:08,428 --> 01:22:29,477
This is a case of Cann-i. but I want to know a little bit more and the story unfolds.

684
01:22:34,984 --> 01:22:45,624
Fear of insanity; Calc., Cann-i., Manc. and Puls. are the capital remedies for this problem.

685
01:22:47,909 --> 01:22:57,144
The worst is Manc. It’s the most crazy.

686
01:22:57,385 --> 01:23:06,868
The second is Cann-i. and then comes Puls. and then Calc.

687
01:23:07,109 --> 01:23:10,185
But other remedies have that.

688
01:23:26,346 --> 01:23:34,485
The analysis of the computer after the first 6 symptoms said Cann-i. is the probable,

689
01:23:34,585 --> 01:23:44,068
with Anac., Carb-v., Cic., Op., Nat-ar. Cann-i.

690
01:23:44,335 --> 01:23:52,015
what I was thinking and also the computer was thinking exactly the same way.

691
01:23:53,785 --> 01:24:00,460
She started giving other symptoms.

692
01:24:08,388 --> 01:24:17,866
When alone ameliorates, frightful dreams and fear of suffocation.

693
01:24:21,188 --> 01:24:30,585
If you put these then the computer changes its mind and it says...

694
01:24:32,655 --> 01:24:42,105
No, it doesn’t change it completely but the other remedy you have to think about is Stram.

695
01:24:45,188 --> 01:24:50,965
It gives you a very good idea.

696
01:24:51,065 --> 01:24:58,206
Who has this program, VES? Very few.

697
01:24:58,306 --> 01:25:01,731
I understand, that’s why you could not find the remedy.

698
01:25:02,747 --> 01:25:12,887
The computer will give you some ideas, it’s not the highest authority is you and your knowledge

699
01:25:12,987 --> 01:25:20,144
but the computer definitely will give you some good suggestions.

700
01:25:23,991 --> 01:25:34,051
The computer says Stram. Do you agree that she has some symptoms of Stram.?

701
01:25:34,305 --> 01:25:42,542
Yes, very good. You have step 3?

702
01:25:47,669 --> 01:26:01,787
In the third step you have put 32 symptoms. Give me the analysis.

703
01:26:02,062 --> 01:26:12,202
The analysis says Stram., Med., Staph., Arg-n., Anac.

704
01:26:12,302 --> 01:26:23,308
All these interesting remedies for this case, each one for its own right.

705
01:26:26,382 --> 01:26:37,288
It’s a miracle that she has not had a gonorrhea with the type of life she was living.

706
01:26:37,388 --> 01:26:55,745
Correct? I am surprised because she has a typical symptom of Med.

707
01:26:56,012 --> 01:26:58,828
What is it? The fear.

708
01:26:58,928 --> 01:27:13,185
Show Med. Clairvoyance, prophesying, fear dark, fear someone is behind,

709
01:27:13,429 --> 01:27:19,141
startled easily, frightened easily, fear of insanity, suspicious,

710
01:27:19,387 --> 01:27:28,101
menses clotted, cold water take it out.

711
01:27:29,491 --> 01:27:49,589
Med. has 20 symptoms out of 30. Staph.? Who says this case is Staph.?

712
01:27:50,564 --> 01:28:09,612
Let me see. Who says may be? Who says this case is Stram.?

713
01:28:09,868 --> 01:28:23,425
Who says maybe it is Stram.? Who says this case can be Anac.?

714
01:28:24,187 --> 01:28:46,222
May be Anac.? Arg-n.? May be Arg-n.? No one in favor

715
01:28:49,248 --> 01:29:21,057
Who says this case is Phos.? May be? Who says Cann-i.? May be Cann-i.?

716
01:29:22,852 --> 01:29:28,737
– Why did you say Arg-n.?

717
01:29:31,297 --> 01:29:35,565
- Did you put impulse to jump from high place?

718
01:29:39,048 --> 01:29:55,065
She bruises easily, she says. Is this a case of Phos.?

719
01:29:55,340 --> 01:30:24,505
Who says Phos.? 6. Margit said that she has all the symptoms of Cann-i.

720
01:30:24,795 --> 01:30:35,065
If I ask you this woman when she was a child she needed Cann-i. yes or no?

721
01:30:35,855 --> 01:30:42,149
We finally agree on something.

722
01:30:42,365 --> 01:30:50,104
That means this woman needed some remedy, whatever it might be,

723
01:30:50,345 --> 01:31:02,666
then maybe second and a third one and now she has reached a state where she needs X number of remedies.

724
01:31:02,905 --> 01:31:09,828
Yesterday when we saw about Gels. and some woman was asking me,

725
01:31:10,095 --> 01:31:14,948
whether this was a core remedy, I did not understand it

726
01:31:15,099 --> 01:31:18,026
and perhaps I didn’t give the right answer.

727
01:31:18,547 --> 01:31:28,172
The right answer is that Gels. is the uppermost layer of that case.

728
01:31:28,272 --> 01:31:32,885
Later on, underneath will be a second remedy

729
01:31:32,985 --> 01:31:39,660
but unless you try to lift the first layer,

730
01:31:39,908 --> 01:31:46,060
second and third layer it’s not going to have a real effect.

731
01:31:46,208 --> 01:31:54,745
Bring this woman back to life is a matter of great skill, understanding and knowledge.

732
01:31:58,105 --> 01:32:02,192
So, we have to think very much in this way that means

733
01:32:02,468 --> 01:32:14,992
what most probably was the remedy as a child maybe it was Phos., yes.

734
01:32:15,268 --> 01:32:22,425
You see how it is. Most probably she was Phos.

735
01:32:22,948 --> 01:32:28,068
Now she got some frightful experience.

736
01:32:29,859 --> 01:32:42,148
Maybe she developed after that a state where she would need to go

737
01:32:42,359 --> 01:32:47,504
and have her mother next to her, have the light on.

738
01:32:47,604 --> 01:33:02,546
Maybe she was developing a layer of Stram. Now we are clearer.

739
01:33:03,587 --> 01:33:25,858
Do we give now Stram., or the remedy that case most of her present symptomatology which is Cann-i.?

740
01:33:33,784 --> 01:33:40,184
Now we have strategy, a way of going about

741
01:33:40,431 --> 01:33:52,984
that means we will prescribe Cann-i. with the possibility that maybe now

742
01:33:53,241 --> 01:33:56,105
she will need full light on in her room,

743
01:33:56,205 --> 01:34:08,387
the fear maybe will be more when she comes to Stram.

744
01:34:08,654 --> 01:34:17,104
and then you give it and then she may come into the first layer of Phos.

745
01:34:17,347 --> 01:34:27,854
in which case she will have the possibility of coming back to connection with life.

746
01:34:28,344 --> 01:34:38,345
She is disconnected from life now because life force goes throught the vital force.

747
01:34:47,544 --> 01:35:01,624
This is the analysis of this case and we will start by giving her a few doses of Cann-i. 200C.

748
01:35:01,904 --> 01:35:07,534
She can take for a week and then wait and see what happens.

749
01:35:07,785 --> 01:35:13,918
Wait for 4-5 months and then she can communicate.

750
01:35:14,424 --> 01:35:30,064
Next year, she will be willing to come and continue her treatment. You understand?

751
01:35:33,604 --> 01:35:40,134
– Would you expect a strong aggravation from the underlying layers?

752
01:35:46,896 --> 01:35:56,621
– Not in the stage. A strong aggravation will come most probably after Stram.

753
01:35:58,144 --> 01:36:08,907
And things will be become physical and she will bring out this skin eruption.

754
01:36:22,987 --> 01:36:35,264
She meant sinusitis? I perceived it as a skin eruption!

755
01:36:35,787 --> 01:36:54,736
She will have back this sinusitis full force and urinary infection and she will be very happy!

756
01:36:56,016 --> 01:37:09,824
– Should you give Penicillinum in potency?
– Forget it!

757
01:37:12,656 --> 01:37:20,336
– Would it make a difference in the case if she had used LSD or other hallucinogenic drugs?

758
01:37:20,587 --> 01:37:31,076
– The way she describes her symptoms? No. If she had described other symptoms, yes.
