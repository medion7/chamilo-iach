1
00:00:13,836 --> 00:00:32,012
Your case number is 347. What is the problem?

2
00:00:32,204 --> 00:00:46,084
– I’ve got 3 main problems. The first is ME; myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue.

3
00:00:46,154 --> 00:00:55,664
The other is migraine and the third one is a chronically tense, painful back.

4
00:00:57,704 --> 00:01:04,865
– When did these symptoms arise? Especially the ME.

5
00:01:05,142 --> 00:01:12,822
– After I have been in parliament for 2,5 years, in my first term, I had pneumonia,

6
00:01:13,064 --> 00:01:22,544
I had treatment with IV antibiotics, I went on working really hard

7
00:01:22,785 --> 00:01:26,464
and I never really recovered and about 6 months after that many things happened,

8
00:01:26,732 --> 00:01:31,852
I had a great deal of pressure because I chose it, I didn’t have to do it but I did.

9
00:01:32,104 --> 00:01:39,424
It just started then and it just got worse and worse until I was almost bedridden.

10
00:01:39,664 --> 00:01:51,357
For 9 months I struggled to talk, to work, to concentrate and I have a homeopath in South Africa,

11
00:01:51,457 --> 00:01:58,348
he helped me with many remedies and we hit on one; Nat-c. which helped me.

12
00:01:58,624 --> 00:02:09,377
The back problem I’ve had since I was about 25, on and off. It’s getting very bad now.

13
00:02:09,624 --> 00:02:14,625
– What kind of back problem? Is it on sacral or lumbar region?

14
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:18,380
– That’s one of my symptoms. It varies.

15
00:02:18,524 --> 00:02:24,780
It can be on the left, on the right, in the thoracic vertebrae, in the lumbar region, sciatic...

16
00:02:25,024 --> 00:02:30,464
It varies. I’ve got chronic arthritis all the way down my back.

17
00:02:30,604 --> 00:02:36,144
As a child I slipped down a haystack and I landed on my bottom, not on my feet.

18
00:02:36,385 --> 00:02:39,984
And I think it’s the damage of that.

19
00:02:40,264 --> 00:02:46,674
– And migraines?
– I didn’t have them for a long time.

20
00:02:46,774 --> 00:02:51,382
They’re coming back now. I get them about once a month.

21
00:02:51,524 --> 00:02:55,464
I get a premonition of the migraine.

22
00:02:55,634 --> 00:03:01,104
My vision goes away on the right side and sometimes I get,

23
00:03:01,345 --> 00:03:05,974
like television screen, right in the right corner. And then...

24
00:03:06,224 --> 00:03:13,384
- The migraine starts...
- Yes. I usually want to on working so I take Sandomigran.

25
00:03:13,654 --> 00:03:18,262
I will try yoga, deep breathing, meditation.

26
00:03:18,774 --> 00:03:23,082
If that doesn’t help then I take Sandomigran

27
00:03:23,182 --> 00:03:25,784
and then I am left with the headache for about 2 days.

28
00:03:26,028 --> 00:03:35,990
And the headache is usually worse on the left side.

29
00:03:36,164 --> 00:03:39,468
– What other remedies have you taken except of Nat-c.?

30
00:03:39,644 --> 00:03:41,904
Can you give me a list?

31
00:03:42,177 --> 00:03:54,464
– Many. What I can remember I’ve taken Sulph, Thuja, Med., Lyc.

32
00:03:55,584 --> 00:04:05,217
Before I took Puls., Ferr. and Nat-c.

33
00:04:05,464 --> 00:04:10,344
-That’s all?
–Sep.?

34
00:04:10,614 --> 00:04:15,464
– A bit. On and off over the years I’ve tried little bits of the others

35
00:04:15,634 --> 00:04:19,837
but the one’s I’ve found, I thought they made some difference, I’ve carried them.

36
00:04:19,937 --> 00:04:22,440
I’ve taken a bit of Sep. but not a lot.

37
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:27,660
When I take a homeopathic remedy I usually prove it.

38
00:04:27,904 --> 00:04:34,102
If I take Puls. 10M I get shooting pains down my leg and bladder symptoms.

39
00:04:34,344 --> 00:04:42,294
If I take Nux-v. I get very severe aggravation of my flu symptoms.

40
00:04:44,342 --> 00:04:50,465
If I take Lyc. everything gets worse on the right.

41
00:04:50,642 --> 00:04:55,862
I once took Lyc. and I had cutting pains in my abdomen for about 6 months.

42
00:04:56,104 --> 00:05:01,744
I also have indigestion.

43
00:05:08,904 --> 00:05:14,422
– I can mention something about ME, it’s quite important, I think.

44
00:05:14,664 --> 00:05:17,744
Like I said I have a premonition with the migraine.

45
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:21,825
As I am sitting talking to you now, I am putting a lot of energy into it,

46
00:05:22,102 --> 00:05:26,704
otherwise I would be just mumbling. My speech becomes very mumbling.

47
00:05:26,945 --> 00:05:32,854
I just don’t want to talk. Talking makes me worse.

48
00:05:33,104 --> 00:05:35,144
Especially talking on the phone.

49
00:05:35,414 --> 00:05:40,534
I get impatient and that impatience makes me much worse.

50
00:05:40,684 --> 00:05:43,224
Also I get the premonition of getting back.

51
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:53,984
I get almost like an electric current through my face and around my mouth and a bit in my right ear,

52
00:05:54,252 --> 00:05:58,344
in my right hand and in my right foot.

53
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:06,582
And then I know when that starts to come then I know I am going down again.

54
00:06:10,145 --> 00:06:17,334
I have a lot of hawking of mucus. I got a lot of postnasal drip.

55
00:06:17,584 --> 00:06:26,624
I don’t cough it out. And when my homeopath gave me Nat-c.

56
00:06:26,892 --> 00:06:33,784
I had a lot of brownish-greenish mucus that I was coughing at that time.

57
00:06:34,824 --> 00:06:39,944
– With the migraines do you have to vomit?
– No.

58
00:06:40,704 --> 00:06:45,304
– And where exactly are they situated?

59
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:51,212
– The picture goes patchy on the right,

60
00:06:51,464 --> 00:06:58,384
the light starts to flicker around the extreme arch on the right

61
00:06:58,657 --> 00:07:00,577
and then I get a pain in the back of my head and in my neck too.

62
00:07:00,824 --> 00:07:06,464
– On the left side or the whole back?
– Mainly on the left.

63
00:07:06,977 --> 00:07:09,537
– Which extends towards the eye or stays there?

64
00:07:09,684 --> 00:07:12,217
– Worse on the back of my head, very bad.

65
00:07:12,364 --> 00:07:25,708
– On the left occipital protuberance. What else you had as history?

66
00:07:25,985 --> 00:07:31,104
– In my history I have a tonsillectomy as a child,

67
00:07:31,344 --> 00:07:39,254
I had a hysterectomy at about 35 or 37, now I am 57 so that was 20 years ago.

68
00:07:39,504 --> 00:07:42,064
– Why did you have the hysterectomy?

69
00:07:42,205 --> 00:07:47,425
– I had a prolapsed uterus and I was starting to have bladder problems with it.

70
00:07:51,784 --> 00:07:57,942
The doctor said either a repair or a hysterectomy and didn’t know Homeopathy then.

71
00:07:58,184 --> 00:08:05,104
I had a hysterectomy.
– Anything else?

72
00:08:08,012 --> 00:08:19,264
– I couldn’t eat for about 3 years because I had such severe burning pains

73
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:23,372
if I ate anything I used to get very severe pains.

74
00:08:23,624 --> 00:08:25,832
Everything in me is extreme.

75
00:08:25,932 --> 00:08:32,484
If I work, it’s extreme, if I get ill, it’s really sick,

76
00:08:32,624 --> 00:08:36,544
if I get flu my body aches, I think I am going to die.

77
00:08:36,812 --> 00:08:42,184
I do things with a passion, it’s very hard to just...

78
00:08:42,324 --> 00:08:47,052
I try very hard, I’ve tried to change my nature, to be calm,

79
00:08:47,304 --> 00:08:53,184
to talk slowly, to meditate, when I am anxious, I get very anxious.

80
00:08:53,452 --> 00:09:01,032
– You are anxious?
– I am a Jewish mother in extreme.

81
00:09:01,132 --> 00:09:06,252
I am chronically anxious about my children.

82
00:09:08,564 --> 00:09:15,704
– Another anxiety?
– Your husband is...

83
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:21,344
- A doctor, a surgeon, he’s in South Africa.

84
00:09:21,864 --> 00:09:35,944
– And you have any other fear or depression? You talked about depression.

85
00:09:36,184 --> 00:09:41,772
What kind of depression?
– Not depression. I’ve never been depressed.

86
00:09:42,264 --> 00:09:50,464
– Anxious and fears?
– I fear thinking about snakes. I don’t like the thought of snakes.

87
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:53,640
Even more than the idea of meeting an idea on the ground.

88
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:59,104
I don’t like to think about snakes.

89
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:04,864
I think it could be from when I was a child my parents left to go to the seas,

90
00:10:05,032 --> 00:10:08,460
I think I was about 10, I was a very sensitive child.

91
00:10:08,704 --> 00:10:13,580
Somebody stayed in the house and told us many stories about snakes.

92
00:10:13,824 --> 00:10:18,184
And then I remember having the most terrible dreams about snakes.

93
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,817
I don’t know if that’s the reason.

94
00:10:23,064 --> 00:10:24,464
– You cannot see it in even in a picture?

95
00:10:24,737 --> 00:10:28,304
– If I see a picture of a snake...no.

96
00:10:29,344 --> 00:10:34,572
Sometimes if I close my eyes and I am in a bad state mentally or emotionally

97
00:10:34,824 --> 00:10:39,222
and I see snakes I can go crazy.

98
00:10:39,464 --> 00:10:40,744
But I haven’t for quite a while.

99
00:10:40,814 --> 00:10:50,984
I just know that I don’t like the thought of snakes.
– Any other fear?

100
00:10:51,254 --> 00:11:03,854
– No. When I am in a high place, the impulse, I wonder how many people don’t jump.

101
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:11,734
I don’t want to jump. But the thought... It’s so easy; just jump!

102
00:11:12,225 --> 00:11:17,345
– What about food? Do you have any particular desire?

103
00:11:17,522 --> 00:11:26,305
– I like sweet food like sweets fruits and sweets, I love ice cream.

104
00:11:29,384 --> 00:11:41,584
I say why didn’t I take Phos.? Hot drinks, always and a lot of them.

105
00:11:43,084 --> 00:11:49,024
It must be hot. I really don’t like warm food.

106
00:11:49,264 --> 00:11:53,104
I must have hot soup, hot drinks.

107
00:11:55,664 --> 00:12:02,048
–Salt?
– I don’t like salt. I like potatoes.

108
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:15,904
And I don’t like onions or the smell of onions, especially raw onions.

109
00:12:24,588 --> 00:12:33,304
I cannot take acids; tomatoes, vinegar.

110
00:12:48,664 --> 00:12:59,148
– Your mood changes?
– Not so much.

111
00:12:59,424 --> 00:13:04,784
– This happens in case you are sick or in case you are well?

112
00:13:05,057 --> 00:13:09,144
– I’d say about my mood when I do feel something it is very intense.

113
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:16,064
If I see a beautiful scene, like I would walk around here I am on a high.

114
00:13:16,204 --> 00:13:22,944
– You are excitable.
– If I am dancing I get very uplifted.

115
00:13:23,112 --> 00:13:27,820
If I hear music I get very moved by it.

116
00:13:29,804 --> 00:13:40,104
If start to talk about politics I get worked up.

117
00:14:03,904 --> 00:14:12,864
The same tune can play over and over in my head, I hear and...

118
00:14:13,132 --> 00:14:20,544
- You cannot get it out.
– Yes. And I get pins and needles easily.

119
00:14:20,812 --> 00:14:26,700
If I sit on the ground, if I sleep on my hands, I get pins and needles.

120
00:14:26,944 --> 00:14:31,544
I used to like to sleep on my tummy with my hands under the cushion,

121
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:36,940
but now because of my back I made myself lying on my back

122
00:14:37,184 --> 00:14:45,624
and I also like to put my hands up above my head or just like this.

123
00:14:50,744 --> 00:15:04,584
I often get chilblains in my left fourth toe. I’ve got very dry skin.

124
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,412
I can tell you my generals.

125
00:15:18,664 --> 00:15:24,300
I can’t bear to be sitting in a closed room for a long time.

126
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:28,908
I have to get up and move and have air. All my life.

127
00:15:29,084 --> 00:15:34,028
In parliament I’d get the worst marks for the one who sits in the afternoon

128
00:15:34,306 --> 00:15:39,148
because I just have to get up.

129
00:15:39,324 --> 00:15:44,784
The artificial ventilation, closed rooms, warm rooms...terrible.

130
00:15:45,057 --> 00:15:46,928
I can’t stand it.

131
00:15:47,104 --> 00:15:53,104
Even when I am really bad with the ME and I don’t want to do anything

132
00:15:53,277 --> 00:15:56,184
it frustrates me not to do something.

133
00:15:56,428 --> 00:15:58,744
I want to try and do something.

134
00:15:58,988 --> 00:16:06,424
I’m better when I move and physical movement.

135
00:16:07,724 --> 00:16:18,188
- Dance? 
- I like dancing. I feel good. Or if I walk.

136
00:16:18,188 --> 00:16:25,464
– Now that you are in such weak state if you walk you walk slowly?
– Yes.

137
00:16:30,092 --> 00:16:29,217
I am doing everything now slowly because hurry makes me much worse.

138
00:16:29,464 --> 00:16:34,337
If I wake up and I know I am late and I have to hurry I just...

139
00:16:34,584 --> 00:16:41,228
But I normally do like to do everything quickly, my nature is to talk quickly,

140
00:16:41,504 --> 00:16:51,224
I hate being in queues, if I talk on the phone and they have this machine... I can go mad.

141
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:57,624
And I’m not good with workers. I am quite nasty.

142
00:16:57,668 --> 00:17:03,304
– Impatient.
– Yes because if my staff is slow and they don’t do what I want them to do

143
00:17:03,544 --> 00:17:11,224
I get quite ratty, I’m not very nice. Quite strict.

144
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:16,064
I’m more concerned to get the job done than to be nice to the person.

145
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:23,744
I am guilty afterwards. That’s my nature.

146
00:17:23,984 --> 00:17:33,708
– Would you find some cutting remarks to do to somebody who is...

147
00:17:34,744 --> 00:17:43,184
Something that you know it is his sensitive point.

148
00:17:43,704 --> 00:17:49,068
– I don’t try to hurt him. I just say what I think.

149
00:17:49,344 --> 00:17:57,537
I am very anti-political correctness. If I don’t want to do what is fashionable.

150
00:17:57,784 --> 00:18:06,497
I prefer to do what is right and honest. It’s very important to me.

151
00:18:06,844 --> 00:18:11,464
Joining my party was always a very strange thing to do.

152
00:18:11,704 --> 00:18:17,344
White and Jewish and middle class in the black Zulu party...

153
00:18:17,512 --> 00:18:22,945
people thought I was crazy. Doing Homeopathy 12 years ago in South Africa...

154
00:18:23,222 --> 00:18:26,024
My own medical colleagues thought I was crazy.

155
00:18:26,294 --> 00:18:29,985
– But you didn’t care.
– I almost enjoyed it.

156
00:18:30,262 --> 00:18:41,014
– You do whatever you like... Do these headaches ever change place?

157
00:18:41,264 --> 00:18:46,264
Or are always on the left side?
– No, sometimes are on the right. I come to remember now.

158
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:52,664
I think sometimes after my migraines I use to have pains on the right. I am remembering now.

159
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,192
Recently I had it on my left, also my backache was most on the left.

160
00:18:57,292 --> 00:19:02,264
But sometimes I think my pain used to be on the right.

161
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:07,264
– Not that one can be on the right, the left time on the right?

162
00:19:07,532 --> 00:19:26,984
– Yes and changeable. I have ridges on my nails. I have hangnails.

163
00:19:33,384 --> 00:19:36,604
When I am very anxious I pull out my hair.

164
00:19:36,704 --> 00:19:39,894
My classmates from the medical school even remember it when I was anxious.

165
00:19:40,144 --> 00:19:46,024
And now when I’m feeling stressed and there are problems I’m on the telephone

166
00:19:46,294 --> 00:19:49,564
and I want to get rid of the telephone I pull out my hair.

167
00:19:49,664 --> 00:19:54,744
I get a lot of tension in my body.
– You actually pull out?

168
00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:02,944
– Yes. Very bad habit especially for a politician.

169
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:16,780
I’m talkative. I like to talk.

170
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:24,972
I’m like very much opposites go together in me.

171
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:29,304
The more I learn the less I think I know.

172
00:20:29,464 --> 00:20:34,060
If you have a seminar like yesterday, in the end of it I will think that’s the one possibility

173
00:20:34,304 --> 00:20:36,864
but that’s the other possibility.

174
00:20:37,132 --> 00:20:44,300
In my work I know that I am very opposed to the government I have total conviction about what I am doing

175
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:51,464
but sometimes if I think deeply through it I think well perhaps at this stage the civilization is in,

176
00:20:51,704 --> 00:20:56,584
everything they are doing that is bad, that is populist, that I think is dishonest

177
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:02,004
but I am totally committed to fighting and maybe they’re up!

178
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:12,972
I always see two sides. In my life it’s very important to have balance.

179
00:21:15,264 --> 00:21:23,400
– Can I ask you a question? How is your sexual drive?
– Normal.

180
00:21:26,024 --> 00:21:32,704
– Was never totally lost?
– No.

181
00:21:35,777 --> 00:21:38,944
– You didn’t tell me whether you feel cold or hot.

182
00:21:39,212 --> 00:21:48,065
– I’m very cold and I’ve always got cold feet and often cold hands. Not here.

183
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:54,365
– The desire for sweet is very great?

184
00:21:54,465 --> 00:21:59,862
– No. I just like sweet things. I don’t like sugar in my tea.

185
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:03,704
– But hot drinks definitely you like?
– Very much.

186
00:22:03,879 --> 00:22:10,657
If I have cold drink it gives me headache. I got bad teeth.

187
00:22:12,944 --> 00:22:15,777
Should I tell you about my dreams?

188
00:22:17,104 --> 00:22:26,024
Sometimes I have amazing dreams, as if I had discovered paradise in my head. Vivid colors.

189
00:22:26,294 --> 00:22:31,414
I was seeing the sea and the lagoon and mountains and it’s like the colors here.

190
00:22:31,664 --> 00:22:36,534
Blue and magenta and turquoise and pink. It’s quite beautiful!

191
00:22:37,544 --> 00:22:44,214
And then sometimes a scene of nature and I’ll be there and there are animals and water and plants.

192
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:47,265
Almost what we would like to create a paradise.

193
00:22:47,542 --> 00:22:51,894
But other times my dreams are full of trouble.

194
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:58,934
I’d move to a place, a house and then there will be vagrants coming in

195
00:22:59,184 --> 00:23:06,864
and I would be not able to find my children and my family would be all around.

196
00:23:07,005 --> 00:23:13,664
Just problems, things that I have to deal with. There’s two conflicting dreams.

197
00:23:15,824 --> 00:23:22,465
I often dream that I’ve lost my children, I can’t find them.

198
00:23:25,025 --> 00:23:29,384
I have a very sensitive sense of smell.

199
00:23:29,554 --> 00:23:35,265
Very acute sense of smell and sense of color and I don’t like noise.

200
00:23:35,542 --> 00:23:44,502
I love music but I hate noisy music or grating sounds like chalk on the board.

201
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:50,212
– When you do something you do it in hurry always?

202
00:23:50,312 --> 00:24:00,284
– Yes. If I write I make mistakes because I will say one thing, I will say ‘bad’

203
00:24:00,384 --> 00:24:05,772
and I will come back and I will see I didn’t ‘there’ that I wrote ‘bad’.

204
00:24:06,024 --> 00:24:14,064
And if you have me in a quiz show and you ask me my husband’s name I’ll probably forget it.

205
00:24:14,305 --> 00:24:22,085
When I have anticipatory anxiety even after all these years of being on the stage and being in politics

206
00:24:22,266 --> 00:24:32,644
I still feel anxiety before I talk or I perform in public.

207
00:24:32,797 --> 00:24:43,264
Anticipatory anxiety before performance. If I take Lyc. high it gets worse.

208
00:24:43,532 --> 00:24:54,684
– Did you ever try Gels.?
– For acutes. When my ME started I took Gels.

209
00:24:54,784 --> 00:25:02,984
It helped a little, not a lot.
– Anything else?

210
00:25:03,224 --> 00:25:13,724
– When I am like this will suddenly come out perspiration sometimes in my face and my neck and my chest mainly,

211
00:25:13,824 --> 00:25:16,384
top part of my body.

212
00:25:16,624 --> 00:25:24,577
I think that’s all. My memory is really bad.

213
00:25:24,768 --> 00:25:31,062
– Can you tell me exactly where are the weak points of memory?

214
00:25:31,304 --> 00:25:36,424
– If somebody would tell me the Greek word for ‘hello’ or which way we walked

215
00:25:36,694 --> 00:25:41,025
I feel like I forget it immediately and they have to tell me again and again.

216
00:25:41,202 --> 00:25:45,924
That’s when I’m ill. My memory just goes.

217
00:25:46,024 --> 00:25:51,905
And I will write something in my diary and then I look and think ‘when did I write that’?

218
00:25:52,182 --> 00:25:58,824
I have no recollection. I feel like somebody else took my diary.

219
00:25:58,984 --> 00:26:07,944
– What about words? Can you find words easily?
– No. Especially again when I am performing.

220
00:26:08,184 --> 00:26:13,824
If I write, I do a lot of articles, beautiful... it just comes,

221
00:26:14,092 --> 00:26:20,744
flows but if I am talking I just can’t find the word that I am looking for

222
00:26:20,884 --> 00:26:23,414
and the harder I try the more it goes away.

223
00:26:23,664 --> 00:26:27,154
– And you forget names of course very much.
– Very badly.

224
00:26:27,254 --> 00:26:33,932
– And you forget what you want to do from one moment to the other?
– Yes.

225
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:54,144
– When did you have the pneumonia?
– 1996.

226
00:26:54,412 --> 00:27:01,924
– Since 1996 your health took a downward trend.
– Yes.

227
00:27:02,024 --> 00:27:12,504
And I’d make an admission; on 1997 I got the ME, on 1998 I had vaccination for flu because I was scared.

228
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:16,864
I just thought I’ve got such a busy year and I was better

229
00:27:17,132 --> 00:27:23,264
and they had given me some time off from parliament and I had to work and I couldn’t be sick.

230
00:27:23,932 --> 00:27:32,744
– Ok.
– As I was sitting here now there was a current in my hands.

231
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:42,220
We are living now in this world in which we will have to face problems of that type

232
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:52,268
and you heard the problem of Ruth and you know how big is the problem of

233
00:27:52,544 --> 00:28:00,722
 what they call it benign myalgic encephalomyelitis ME

234
00:28:00,822 --> 00:28:07,528
or they call it fatigue syndrome or post viral syndrome.

235
00:28:07,628 --> 00:28:16,202
It has different names this disease but what is this disease?

236
00:28:16,302 --> 00:28:25,384
Is nothing else but the aftereffects of antibiotics in an organism who has a weak immune system.

237
00:28:25,654 --> 00:28:29,744
It breaks down the immune system for good and forever.

238
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:43,574
They call it post viral syndrome. They found out that it comes after an infection.

239
00:28:43,824 --> 00:28:51,745
They never said what about what did we do to deplete the organism

240
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:56,865
by antibiotics or by chemical drugs.

241
00:28:57,384 --> 00:29:08,704
Can you realize how simple facts are missed or they don’t want to see?

242
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:16,384
The responsible authorities they don’t want to see simple facts

243
00:29:16,624 --> 00:29:26,344
and then there are associations of benign myalgic encephalomyelitis or Epstein-Barr.

244
00:29:27,804 --> 00:29:42,224
This disease has 4 names. This disease was practically unknown 50 years ago.

245
00:29:42,497 --> 00:29:50,424
And today there are associations with the patients.

246
00:29:50,668 --> 00:30:00,417
As the other case we will be discussing afterwards, he belongs to this association.

247
00:30:00,664 --> 00:30:08,864
The victims are so many that there are associations of course.

248
00:30:09,004 --> 00:30:19,344
When I say there was no such thing before 50 years I don’t mean it didn’t exist,

249
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:24,737
I mean that there was no such an epidemic as we see today.

250
00:30:24,984 --> 00:30:29,288
All diseases, what we see today, according to my understanding

251
00:30:29,388 --> 00:30:32,374
they have existed from time immemorial.

252
00:30:32,624 --> 00:30:34,934
AIDS also was existing.

253
00:30:35,184 --> 00:30:43,105
If you deplete the immune system you get several syndromes

254
00:30:43,382 --> 00:30:47,464
depending on the change that you have depleted.

255
00:30:47,734 --> 00:30:52,584
Of the immune system. And you get the benign myalgic encephalomyelitis

256
00:30:52,854 --> 00:31:00,434
or you may get AIDS or you may get a totally different disease.

257
00:31:00,534 --> 00:31:06,145
That means even in time immemorial if somebody was mistreated,

258
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:09,124
ate badly etc. and his immune system was low,

259
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:16,904
you may have found some clinical picture looking alike.

260
00:31:17,174 --> 00:31:34,305
But this is an epidemic. I will ask if he has any numbers in England.

261
00:31:34,482 --> 00:31:43,542
You most probably have numbers in England of registered people suffering of it.

262
00:31:44,822 --> 00:31:54,544
– The number of people belonging to the ME association I think is about 3.000.

263
00:31:55,062 --> 00:32:03,254
The estimates I ‘ve heard about the disease depends on who has done the study,

264
00:32:03,404 --> 00:32:16,054
but it’s about 1.5 to 4 per 100.000 of the population.

265
00:32:16,304 --> 00:32:20,224
–Which means for England in actual numbers?

266
00:32:20,492 --> 00:32:23,820
- I think the estimates are too high.

267
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:31,500
The highest estimate I’ve heard is maybe 100.000 people in England.

268
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:41,224
– I will take half of it, 50.000 in England and in West,

269
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:47,864
will be by millions perhaps 2 million people

270
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:53,504
because you have to take into consideration people like Ruth are not registered.

271
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:58,104
Thousands of them are not registered.

272
00:32:58,394 --> 00:33:10,668
Yet we have a disease which is in the West, it doesn’t exist in India.

273
00:33:10,944 --> 00:33:12,984
They hardly know this disease.

274
00:33:13,228 --> 00:33:17,068
In South America they hardly know this disease. In Africa too.

275
00:33:17,344 --> 00:33:19,137
Now they will start knowing it.

276
00:33:19,384 --> 00:33:23,644
For the last 10 years where the antibiotics have been exploding there,

277
00:33:23,744 --> 00:33:27,824
they will start knowing all these diseases, as well.

278
00:33:28,097 --> 00:33:41,144
But not before 20 years ago, unknown in Arab world, in Asia, in Africa, in South America.

279
00:33:41,388 --> 00:33:50,104
Yet in the western world using all this excessive medication...

280
00:33:51,137 --> 00:34:00,064
Hundreds of thousands and it’s a severe depletion of the immune system

281
00:34:00,332 --> 00:34:06,988
and it needs very careful prescribing.

282
00:34:07,264 --> 00:34:11,104
In this case if you don’t prescribe correctly and start giving a remedy after another

283
00:34:11,345 --> 00:34:14,668
you deplete the organism more and more.

284
00:34:15,548 --> 00:34:18,624
And you have to take that into consideration very much

285
00:34:18,892 --> 00:34:24,924
that you do not give remedy after remedy in such cases.

286
00:34:25,024 --> 00:34:30,904
They will end up in total depletion of energy.

287
00:34:31,424 --> 00:34:43,464
You have to be very careful how you start and how you proceed.

288
00:34:48,332 --> 00:35:00,904
With Ruth now, take this depletion of energy

289
00:35:01,945 --> 00:35:10,412
especially when she says that she cannot talk on the telephone,

290
00:35:10,564 --> 00:35:18,092
the remedy that comes to the mind, Stan.

291
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:30,624
And you have to think of another remedy maybe Gels.

292
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:45,740
As she was progressing giving her case, better dancing, better with motion,

293
00:35:46,052 --> 00:35:54,424
the idea of Sep. came especially with the fact that she had a prolapsed uterus.

294
00:35:54,605 --> 00:36:05,944
So there is an idea of Sep. there as well. Cocc.

295
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:12,864
We could have Cocc. in case she would complain with vertigo.

296
00:36:13,384 --> 00:36:18,253
She complained of migraines and this is different.

297
00:36:22,092 --> 00:36:34,624
Sep. has the headache which is preceded by visional disturbances.

298
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:50,252
Visional disturbances preceding the headache is Iris. Show me these remedies.

299
00:36:50,504 --> 00:37:00,224
Because she has clearly that symptom; visional disturbances before the headache.

300
00:37:00,492 --> 00:37:03,544
She describes it very clearly.

301
00:37:08,544 --> 00:37:11,542
– So, you want to see the whole list of the repertorization?

302
00:37:11,784 --> 00:37:14,864
Or the rubric?
- Just the rubric.

303
00:37:15,005 --> 00:37:27,905
– Which one is the rubric, sorry?
– Vision, blurred before headache.

304
00:37:29,924 --> 00:37:45,584
Gels., Hyos., Iris is strong, Kali-b., Sep., Sulph., Lac-d., Pod., Psor. and Tub.

305
00:37:45,825 --> 00:38:03,254
– Cycl. has blurring during headache.

306
00:38:03,622 --> 00:38:10,664
– This is preceding the headache.

307
00:38:13,494 --> 00:38:17,334
The possibility of Tub. is there also.

308
00:38:18,344 --> 00:38:29,622
I don’t know if she had any tubercular predisposition in her family.

309
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:43,844
No. But the fear of snakes is so strong that we thought of Lac-c.

310
00:38:43,944 --> 00:38:55,734
And Lac-c. has another symptom; desire for hot drinks.

311
00:38:55,884 --> 00:39:02,022
– And another thing she has is her inner state to cover alternating sides.

312
00:39:04,694 --> 00:39:14,934
– She said I pulled out that symptom. But I am not quite certain.

313
00:39:15,344 --> 00:39:17,857
– My symptoms do vary a lot.

314
00:39:18,104 --> 00:39:21,784
Like my back is being sore mostly on the left but some days on the right.

315
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:26,904
I’ve had a lot of sore throats. I’ve forgot to mention that.

316
00:39:27,177 --> 00:39:39,752
Sometimes left, sometimes, right. I think I was a right sided person.

317
00:39:39,852 --> 00:39:43,424
But lately I’ve had problems on the left.

318
00:39:43,692 --> 00:39:47,532
But sometimes it goes back to the right. It does fluctuate.

319
00:39:51,372 --> 00:40:00,374
– Let us say you have 4 headaches in a year or a month.

320
00:40:00,624 --> 00:40:04,705
The first headache is on the right, the second headache on the left,

321
00:40:04,982 --> 00:40:08,445
the third headache on the right, the fourth headache on the left.

322
00:40:08,545 --> 00:40:14,945
This is Lac-c. Is that the case? Definitely not.

323
00:40:15,122 --> 00:40:18,962
I pulled out this and she left it in the air.

324
00:40:19,304 --> 00:40:24,944
– But in her very inner state she has alternating opinions...

325
00:40:25,185 --> 00:40:34,934
- Not alternating. She can see 2 different aspects, 2 opposing aspects.

326
00:40:35,034 --> 00:40:38,264
– But perhaps I should also add I am terribly tenacious.

327
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:45,704
Badly, so. If I want something to happen I just have to go on until it happens.

328
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:49,264
If I do one thing and it needs two I will do two

329
00:40:49,505 --> 00:40:52,342
and if these do needs another one I will do three.

330
00:40:52,584 --> 00:40:56,694
If all three to succeed need four and five I have to do them.

331
00:40:57,185 --> 00:41:02,994
One of my children said if you want to break someone’s head just ask Ruth to do it.

332
00:41:03,094 --> 00:41:11,784
I can’t stop. Although I know I am making myself ill, I don’t want to, I have to.

333
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:25,452
– Can you find the compulsion? Another possibility?

334
00:41:25,704 --> 00:41:30,824
Somebody will speak about Ph-ac.? No.

335
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:43,272
In spite of the fact you see the memory is affected quite strongly still the emotions are there.

336
00:41:43,372 --> 00:41:57,184
They are not flattened.
– What about Puls.?

337
00:41:57,352 --> 00:42:07,692
Changeable symptoms, desire hot drinks. Puls. is there.

338
00:42:07,792 --> 00:42:19,980
– But it’s not really... What about Puls.?

339
00:42:20,124 --> 00:42:28,060
She is very chilly. Stuffy rooms.

340
00:42:30,984 --> 00:42:38,904
The problem is with the stuffiness in a closed room and she is cold.

341
00:42:40,704 --> 00:42:52,224
Are you crying easily?
– No. I cry for ideas.

342
00:42:52,492 --> 00:42:56,824
If I will hear a very great speech or I will see a film, at the end of the film,

343
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:01,224
the idea moves me I will cry.
– You are excited about the idea.

344
00:43:02,984 --> 00:43:10,262
– Are you very tidy?
– She is not tidy.

345
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:19,984
– Just the idea of Tarent. Everything done in a hurry and nervous affinity.

346
00:43:20,225 --> 00:43:37,654
– She likes dancing, yes. I would be surprised to see a Tarent. in so low energy. She is very low.

347
00:43:37,904 --> 00:43:52,225
She said when I come to that state, it is like a disease like MS; it comes in waves.

348
00:43:52,502 --> 00:44:00,594
A wave comes, they go very low and during that time she can even not be able to articulate.

349
00:44:00,694 --> 00:44:07,585
So difficult and tired she is.

350
00:44:16,545 --> 00:44:25,014
– I considered also the combination of weakness and excitability.

351
00:44:25,264 --> 00:44:38,064
Perhaps points to Arg-n. or Arg-m. Electric shocks blains, impulsiveness, hurriedness.

352
00:44:43,944 --> 00:45:00,104
– She is not impulsive in the way... I didn’t get it. The way Arg-n. is impulsive.

353
00:45:02,024 --> 00:45:22,892
Arg-m. Find me the repertorization for Arg-m. Repetition of thoughts, song.

354
00:45:26,464 --> 00:45:33,384
This is not the right rubric.

355
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:42,744
The right rubric, repetition of thoughts, a sound which she heard, this is a Puls. symptom.

356
00:45:45,144 --> 00:45:57,184
Does anybody have this right symptom? She hears a song and the song is repeating itself.

357
00:46:00,012 --> 00:46:05,384
No, it’s another rubric with 6 remedies.

358
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:12,544
Can this keep you awake? No.

359
00:46:12,712 --> 00:46:42,252
Anyhow let’s see the remedies. Which is the remedy to start with?

360
00:46:43,784 --> 00:46:49,320
– Still think it’s Arg-n. because of the symptoms;

361
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:53,504
the stage fright, the weakness, the occiput side left,

362
00:46:53,772 --> 00:47:01,452
the delusion of snakes, talking aggravates, lack of vital heat.

363
00:47:01,604 --> 00:47:08,344
And she said when she is standing in a high place she thinks about how easy it is to jump down.

364
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:25,772
This is the impulse of Arg-n.
– Alum-sil.

365
00:47:26,024 --> 00:47:37,544
– Pourquois?
– The pains that wander she has, the various areas of the pain shift,

366
00:47:37,784 --> 00:47:50,584
coldness that she has in her body, then she has these effects of the nervous system in the spine.

367
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:56,644
The Alum-sil. has these effects upon them.

368
00:47:56,744 --> 00:48:08,264
– Why not Phos.? No fear of thunderstorm, ice cream desire.

369
00:48:08,504 --> 00:48:17,984
Who does not desire ice cream? Who would like to have an ice cream now, at this moment?

370
00:48:18,252 --> 00:48:28,492
Take Phos. instead. The remedies that have a possibility are 2;

371
00:48:28,758 --> 00:48:35,837
Stan. and Lac-c. Between these 2 remedies we have to choose the first remedy

372
00:48:35,937 --> 00:48:42,934
and because there is a strong keynote this desire for hot drinks

373
00:48:43,084 --> 00:48:50,104
which she stressed so much and the fear of snake being so strong.

374
00:48:50,386 --> 00:48:58,064
These 2 keynotes of Lac-c. stressed so much by her.

375
00:48:58,338 --> 00:49:04,464
It leads us to the fact that we have to start with Lac-c.

376
00:49:04,737 --> 00:49:12,417
Not only that, but we see in her repertorization, it also stands first.

377
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:23,148
So Lac-c. is the remedy of first choice with a possibility of Stan.

378
00:49:23,424 --> 00:49:32,897
and a third possibility for Gels. And under Lac-c. I believe that Sep. will arise.

379
00:49:33,388 --> 00:49:49,904
So this is a case of Lac-c. and Sep. most probably. She will start with Lac-c 200C.

380
00:49:50,424 --> 00:50:00,808
In such cases you don’t go higher than 200C because the organism is weak.

381
00:50:00,908 --> 00:50:08,864
Also in such cases there is no way that you can find a clearer picture.

382
00:50:09,104 --> 00:50:19,468
The picture is not clear as you see. It’s Stan., Gels., Sep... But we choose Lac-c.

383
00:50:19,744 --> 00:50:21,164
You don’t go higher.

384
00:50:21,264 --> 00:50:26,892
But you have to repeat several doses before she can start having a reaction.

385
00:50:27,148 --> 00:50:35,340
She will start taking Lac-c. 200C for at least a weak; 7 doses.

386
00:50:35,584 --> 00:50:44,812
And after that she will decide whether she needs some more doses or wait.

387
00:50:52,620 --> 00:51:00,544
The general rule is once you have a reaction from the remedy you stop.

388
00:51:00,544 --> 00:51:05,420
If you wake up tomorrow and no reaction, take a second dose.

389
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:12,404
Third day no reaction, fourth dose. You go like this and see how things are going.
