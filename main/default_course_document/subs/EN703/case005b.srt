1
00:00:17,381 --> 00:00:24,291
You were the strange case of Electricitas (Elec.)
– Yes, that’s me!

2
00:00:24,545 --> 00:00:38,625
– What happened?
– I took Elec. 30C last July every day for one month.

3
00:00:40,421 --> 00:00:50,531
First I stopped drinking coffee and then I got some headaches

4
00:00:50,785 --> 00:00:54,864
which I usually get when I have a remedy.

5
00:00:57,224 --> 00:01:09,221
During the first week there were aching pains in lower extremities, worse sitting.

6
00:01:10,224 --> 00:01:21,251
The sensitivity to PC and TV was maybe little bit better. Happens with other remedies.

7
00:01:23,024 --> 00:01:31,745
Then I had the pain between the shoulder blades which I had before in the back condition.

8
00:01:31,984 --> 00:01:38,907
It went away. Then some cervical, lumber pain which I also have had before.

9
00:01:40,187 --> 00:01:51,461
One strange thing; urination pattern changed. Many times in the night I would go back and forth,

10
00:01:51,971 --> 00:02:02,465
now only in the morning 6-7 a.m. And this has sort of remained since then.

11
00:02:02,981 --> 00:02:17,571
Then swollen gums which I had before. One day I woke with the right arm partially numb

12
00:02:18,341 --> 00:02:32,931
which I have had before. There were some peculiar spot pains, one here and then one right here,

13
00:02:33,224 --> 00:02:39,824
then in the liver area. This I’ve had before too.

14
00:02:40,347 --> 00:02:51,621
Then my step son at the time bought one of these ghetto blasters. This boom boom music boxes.

15
00:02:51,731 --> 00:02:57,505
And that one had some kind of frequency that would go into the midbrain

16
00:02:57,744 --> 00:03:02,371
and I could not stay in the house. So, I had to go away.

17
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:06,211
– I don’t understand this.

18
00:03:06,465 --> 00:03:14,661
– Ghetto blaster is a big radio you can carry it around and makes lots of noise.

19
00:03:14,907 --> 00:03:23,105
And people like that. They can carry it around or keep it in the house. Plays CD, radio.

20
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:33,345
Music machine. This was a big one, for kids.
– It’s called ghetto blaster?

21
00:03:33,484 --> 00:03:41,090
– Yes, poor district in America. Blaster means boom boom. Guys go around with this on the shoulders.

22
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:46,980
– It’s a kind of terroristic device.
– So I was driven out of the house

23
00:03:48,506 --> 00:03:54,388
and who would have known that this little thing would cause that

24
00:03:54,906 --> 00:04:05,908
my poor stepson had to suffer from this. Then I had very much dreams.

25
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:17,946
Like a TV series dreams at night. Very bright like watching TV. Nothing special.

26
00:04:21,268 --> 00:04:32,788
Then after 30 days by nervous system was bzzzz like this from the Elec. The nerves were buzzing.

27
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:48,048
Then I stopped taking it and my electric sensitivity was the same.

28
00:04:48,148 --> 00:04:59,306
It wasn’t anything special affected. Then I wrote you an email and we took Elec. 200C.

29
00:04:59,575 --> 00:05:06,465
– From which pharmacy?
– This was from Ainsworth in London.

30
00:05:06,745 --> 00:05:10,826
I got them to send me a whole number of potencies.

31
00:05:11,865 --> 00:05:23,385
So 200C, then of course the first day I could work 50% better on the PC which I work sometimes,

32
00:05:23,626 --> 00:05:29,264
I do some translation. And then after that to same.

33
00:05:35,415 --> 00:05:41,446
I started taking it on 20 th September and then 10 days later, 30 th September,

34
00:05:41,546 --> 00:05:47,265
I would get these pains spontaneous without being able to see any source.

35
00:05:47,532 --> 00:05:55,982
And it was very painful so I took some Hyper. which maybe I shouldn’t have done

36
00:05:56,025 --> 00:06:00,332
but I couldn’t go outside because of the lights out in the street,

37
00:06:01,068 --> 00:06:10,728
I had to stay inside because it was very painful. And I didn’t want to go to the woods where is dark.

38
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:16,972
Not that I am so afraid of the dark but it’s no fun sitting under a tree.

39
00:06:19,022 --> 00:06:32,827
Anyway, the urination pattern was permanently changed. Sleep at night and at 6-7 a.m. I have to go.

40
00:06:33,345 --> 00:06:44,765
I wake up and go to urinate. That was Elec. and I waited till November.

41
00:06:44,865 --> 00:06:53,582
I sent an email and said my picture was back to what it usually is except for his urination thing

42
00:06:53,825 --> 00:07:05,345
and then I was going to go to Brazil in December.  I didn’t want to start taking anything.

43
00:07:05,612 --> 00:07:15,585
You said to take Verb. 30C every other day for 12 times. Because going on the plane,

44
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:19,692
it was much pain from TV and much exposure down there.

45
00:07:20,187 --> 00:07:25,068
Then my father died I come back and I had to go to Norway.

46
00:07:26,348 --> 00:07:30,945
So I started to take 1 st January Verb.

47
00:07:32,748 --> 00:07:46,728
There was not much reaction. Meanwhile I went to Denmark and then I had to come back,

48
00:07:46,828 --> 00:07:51,848
my mother was alone, so I had to care her of her.

49
00:07:51,948 --> 00:07:59,105
And then my wife decided she doesn’t like me anymore, so I stayed there in Norway.

50
00:07:59,372 --> 00:08:09,102
She said not to come back to Denmark. I was having a little clinic in Denmark.

51
00:08:11,662 --> 00:08:15,745
– Where do you mostly live?

52
00:08:16,012 --> 00:08:21,902
– I was living mostly in Copenhagen for 15 years.

53
00:08:22,145 --> 00:08:27,532
Now I am living in Norway, in a little town.

54
00:08:28,812 --> 00:08:34,188
– Not in Brazil?
– You have nothing to do with Brazil?

55
00:08:34,427 --> 00:08:46,988
– Not anymore! My ex-wife is from Brazil. But at the moment I’m staying in Norway.

56
00:08:47,227 --> 00:09:01,064
At the end January  I was getting sensitive to some mobile antennas that there are in this town.

57
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:07,708
I had taken Verb. and I couldn’t know if could sleep at night.

58
00:09:09,506 --> 00:09:20,013
So I took Hyper. and sent the email and we dropped Verb.

59
00:09:23,586 --> 00:09:37,933
Then in February I got a message to take Chin-s. for 12 days.

60
00:09:38,184 --> 00:09:52,926
I thought it was very interesting because my father is born in China but also had malaria!

61
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:57,125
– That’s more interesting!
– That’s just a joke.

62
00:09:57,225 --> 00:10:15,545
0He also has had Indian sprue. He suffered of it all his life. I took it.

63
00:10:16,586 --> 00:10:25,028
In day two there was a dream, violent sea and a beach, old ships of old time

64
00:10:25,785 --> 00:10:29,625
and some amorous type business going on too

65
00:10:30,148 --> 00:10:37,900
and then after a few days burning pain in the face and the forehead, burning pain in vertex,

66
00:10:38,148 --> 00:10:43,020
I am getting more and more sensitive to yellow light.

67
00:10:46,585 --> 00:10:53,508
My mother she was staying in the house then I took down to 25 watts

68
00:10:54,026 --> 00:10:59,908
and then she found her place where she can be and so and now I am alone in the house

69
00:11:00,175 --> 00:11:07,107
and so I turn off the lights in the evening because burns. Street lights burn.

70
00:11:07,346 --> 00:11:17,858
Any ray burns. So yellow light is like sensitive.

71
00:11:18,104 --> 00:11:29,624
Otherwise no big changes except of these kind of symptoms that I mentioned last year.

72
00:11:30,904 --> 00:11:35,924
– All other is the same?
– Yes.

73
00:11:36,024 --> 00:11:43,704
It’s the same basic picture except I was a bit depressed from losing the marriage

74
00:11:43,951 --> 00:11:48,306
but I get used to this. It’s the third time that happens,

75
00:11:48,578 --> 00:12:12,626
so… And that was February, finishing 18 th April. It’s the last day I have here.

76
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:22,351
But I am sensitive to the cellular towers, otherwise the house is ok. Beside the yellow light.

77
00:12:22,627 --> 00:12:25,187
– You feel these cellular antennas!

78
00:12:26,467 --> 00:12:37,456
–They have next to the hospital in the city where I live. 200m away.

79
00:12:37,946 --> 00:12:42,061
But I don’t feel very much. It’s mainly when I am in one place all night sleeping

80
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:44,864
and in the morning is burning.

81
00:12:45,136 --> 00:12:50,507
– And the burning is in the face or the whole skin?

82
00:12:50,746 --> 00:12:58,187
You always show the face and the face seems very red. Have you ever taken Bell. before?

83
00:12:59,706 --> 00:13:05,516
– Yes, sure for small colds. 12C.

84
00:13:05,616 --> 00:13:10,624
But the funny thing is that I had twitching on the left side,

85
00:13:10,868 --> 00:13:18,304
now I have a little bit more on the right side. A little burning pain on the right side.

86
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:21,626
But it’s 99% on the left.

87
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:25,984
– On the left side is burning and the twitching or only the twitching?

88
00:13:26,228 --> 00:13:28,985
– Both. There is not much twitching.

89
00:13:29,232 --> 00:13:35,908
Very little but it’s here around the eyebrow and also on the right side it’s on the eyebrow.

90
00:13:37,188 --> 00:13:41,539
And the burning is like you scrap your elbow on the street.

91
00:13:41,785 --> 00:13:43,224
– So strong?
– Yes.

92
00:13:43,504 --> 00:13:50,147
It can get so strong like putting a cigarette there if I hang around very long.

93
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:53,987
For example on the plane if someone sits behind me with a laptop

94
00:13:54,254 --> 00:14:00,905
or next to me it will start to burning in a spot like somebody holding a cigarette.

95
00:14:03,704 --> 00:14:09,614
Then I move, I go to the toilet and stay there in the back of the plane.

96
00:14:10,627 --> 00:14:13,090
– For the whole flight?
– Yes.

97
00:14:13,344 --> 00:14:19,490
So there’s the symptoms when I get exposed to electricity is there’s burning

98
00:14:19,744 --> 00:14:23,828
and then loss of concentration and lots of thirst.

99
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:40,740
If I start getting thirsty then I look around where’s the device? I am not usually thirsty.

100
00:14:41,886 --> 00:14:49,666
– The water must be cold or anything?
– Could be anything but I like in the middle.

101
00:14:49,933 --> 00:14:53,506
Can be cold, it’s ok but I prefer a little warm.

102
00:14:53,773 --> 00:14:57,103
– And you will drink the whole glass?

103
00:14:57,613 --> 00:15:01,106
– If I drink, I drink a lot.
– 2 glasses?

104
00:15:01,147 --> 00:15:10,307
– I can drink a whole liter if I want in one go. But I seldom drink, even when it’s hot.

105
00:15:11,587 --> 00:15:16,982
But after continued exposure the concentration goes

106
00:15:17,228 --> 00:15:22,866
and eventually I will go to coma which had happened in my anatomy classes.

107
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:30,028
Then I get very restless legs, general restlessness

108
00:15:30,546 --> 00:15:42,207
and then I have to go away because then it will get start getting into the midbrain. Nausea.

109
00:15:42,307 --> 00:15:46,548
In Brazil I was near these cellular antennas in somebody’s house for 1 hour

110
00:15:46,789 --> 00:16:00,628
and I started developing nausea and dizziness from that. Otherwise I am in pretty good health.

111
00:16:00,869 --> 00:16:09,102
– Do you feel better in cold weather?
– I hate cold and wet weather.

112
00:16:11,662 --> 00:16:21,388
That’s why I don’t like so much to live in Scandinavia. Cold, humid. That’s very bad.

113
00:16:21,902 --> 00:16:38,267
The worst. I want to buy an airplane ticket and go to some warm place. It’s really strong.

114
00:16:40,827 --> 00:16:47,182
– Do you have any fear?
– Not so much.

115
00:16:48,462 --> 00:16:54,587
As I said last summer I don’t like if someone is walking behind me. But it’s not a fear.

116
00:16:58,188 --> 00:17:04,332
I don’t really register any strong fears.

117
00:17:05,612 --> 00:17:09,068
– High places?
– That I don’t like.

118
00:17:09,307 --> 00:17:24,428
I feel very uncomfortable. That’s always been there.

119
00:17:29,826 --> 00:17:37,786
– From last year you are still the same weight or you put one some weight?

120
00:17:38,027 --> 00:17:45,466
– Maybe 1 kilo more since I went to Norway because there they eat a lot.

121
00:17:47,256 --> 00:17:55,185
– Can you see in TV if there are wars and cut legs?

122
00:17:55,426 --> 00:17:57,986
– No problem.

123
00:17:58,066 --> 00:18:11,576
– You can see that. Also you can help in case an accident happens and there is some blood?

124
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:16,945
– That’s ok.
– No problem.

125
00:18:17,186 --> 00:18:19,505
You were in the army some time?

126
00:18:20,026 --> 00:18:24,107
– I’ve moved so much in my life but then I was in Norway

127
00:18:24,376 --> 00:18:30,507
and they said now you have to be in the weekend soldiers. I liked that very much.

128
00:18:31,025 --> 00:18:37,425
They made a sergeant and I used to win the war games every year, get the medal.

129
00:18:37,466 --> 00:19:01,227
I like that! Also startling in sleep. This has happened, before more. It can happen.

130
00:19:04,867 --> 00:19:08,626
- There is any salivation?
– Not really.

131
00:19:09,144 --> 00:19:14,787
– You tolerate onions?
– Yes I like onions.

132
00:19:15,026 --> 00:19:22,978
– Where you vaccinated? 
– I’ve been vaccinated standardly I think.

133
00:19:23,986 --> 00:19:33,218
I had TB vaccine and I’m sure I’ve had smallpox as a child.

134
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,696
– When you traveled to Brazil you have to be vaccinated?

135
00:19:35,947 --> 00:19:43,376
– I didn’t take vaccination but one time I had to work down in Libya in the oil business.

136
00:19:43,866 --> 00:20:00,016
I think I got a vaccination there in 1978… But I had no reaction.

137
00:20:01,347 --> 00:20:06,416
Never had any reactions to vaccinations.

138
00:20:07,986 --> 00:20:11,021
– Warts?
– Yes.

139
00:20:11,264 --> 00:20:19,881
I have some that appeared here, occasionally, and then it falls off.

140
00:20:19,981 --> 00:20:23,845
I’ve had some on the fingers.

141
00:20:23,945 --> 00:20:28,216
– Fell off by themselves?
– Yes.

142
00:20:28,706 --> 00:20:35,106
Somebody told me to put morning spit. You know when you wake up in the morning.

143
00:20:35,386 --> 00:20:37,946
– You did it?
– Yes.

144
00:20:38,187 --> 00:20:48,945
– And then they left.
– Yes. But I never took any medicine.

145
00:20:50,746 --> 00:21:01,496
– I see, yes. I see some light. Let me see says the blind man!

146
00:21:01,986 --> 00:21:09,946
– Let’s see if this is the correct light or the bad light which affects you!

147
00:21:30,427 --> 00:21:38,892
– When I was a child I had lots of colds and then we moved to a warm climate.

148
00:21:42,032 --> 00:21:50,668
When I was 7 or 8 I had many colds in Norway and we moved to South America and then I got well.

149
00:21:50,907 --> 00:21:55,022
– When did you move to S. America?
– When I was 7.

150
00:21:56,032 --> 00:22:04,492
– Up to that time you had lots of colds and then you moved and then no colds anymore.

151
00:22:04,748 --> 00:22:10,892
– Nothing! Since then my health was very good!

152
00:22:11,148 --> 00:22:15,265
– And how many years now you have these problems now with the electricity?

153
00:22:15,504 --> 00:22:18,341
– 7 years.

154
00:22:22,427 --> 00:22:28,065
– I was hoping it will go away by itself after 7 years but…

155
00:22:30,864 --> 00:22:38,821
- Were you bothered by the electricity of thunderstorms?

156
00:22:38,867 --> 00:22:44,451
– No. I like them very much but after having taken Elec. 300C for a month,

157
00:22:44,944 --> 00:22:51,344
there came a thunderstorm and then a big headache came and then the thunderstorm went away

158
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:55,084
and then headache went away.
– That happened one time?

159
00:22:55,184 --> 00:23:03,651
– One time, after having finished taking Elec. 30C for a month.

160
00:23:09,025 --> 00:23:14,145
Otherwise I like thunderstorms.

161
00:23:14,384 --> 00:23:21,571
– In bed you cover your feet?
– Yes. I do.

162
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:30,531
I am a little bit chilly in bed. And I snore, I’m told.

163
00:23:32,465 --> 00:23:38,981
– Is it possible that your feet are cold and sweaty at the same time?

164
00:23:39,227 --> 00:23:49,731
– No. I don’t really get sweaty feet at all.
– Do you get sweat in the night when you sleep?

165
00:23:49,985 --> 00:23:53,571
– I can.
– Which area?

166
00:23:53,825 --> 00:23:58,427
– The chest and the back and also can be the head.

167
00:23:58,691 --> 00:24:07,387
If I drink some alcohol sometimes during the night come out like that. But not all the time.

168
00:24:07,651 --> 00:24:15,067
– Going upstairs is easy for you or you go out of breath easily?

169
00:24:15,331 --> 00:24:23,781
– No. I walked up the Washington monument in Washington.

170
00:24:24,027 --> 00:24:38,191
I was very tired when I went up but it’s a very tall building. There’s one peculiar thing;

171
00:24:40,544 --> 00:24:52,945
My ex-wife was studying some acupuncture and told that there was this point here which ameliorate.

172
00:24:53,217 --> 00:24:58,065
So , when I was on the plane and going to Brazil for 14 long hours

173
00:24:58,337 --> 00:25:03,185
and they lowered down the TVs from the ceiling and a terrible pain started,

174
00:25:03,457 --> 00:25:09,585
then I was lying in a corner pressing here and it would ameliorate 30-40%.

175
00:25:10,108 --> 00:25:22,657
Pressing this point here. So I used that when I had to sit on a course and it starts to hurt.

176
00:25:23,172 --> 00:25:33,666
It helps 30%. But I am sure it is not on repertortories.

177
00:25:35,457 --> 00:25:44,668
– When did he say restlessness to legs?
– Only when exposed.

178
00:25:44,932 --> 00:25:51,332
I have 2 symptom pictures; when there is no stimulus and one when there is stimulus.

179
00:25:51,586 --> 00:25:53,105
– And when there is stimulus you have

180
00:25:53,377 --> 00:26:10,532
- Extreme restlessness of legs.
– Ok, we go analyze!

181
00:26:18,466 --> 00:26:34,237
It’s the first time I prescribed Elec. It was a very big stimulus.

182
00:26:34,337 --> 00:26:42,532
It’s so clear the symptom that is aggravated by electricity that we have to try Elec. first.

183
00:26:43,025 --> 00:27:13,152
Has Elec. acted in this case? This is the case where even if you have old symptoms,

184
00:27:13,206 --> 00:27:18,108
he mentions he had an old symptom in the back etc. No change.

185
00:27:18,372 --> 00:27:23,702
Essentially there was no change because in order to say

186
00:27:23,948 --> 00:27:33,667
that an old symptom has come back you have to have at the same time the amelioration in energy,

187
00:27:36,227 --> 00:27:48,022
emotionally etc. So the fact of the change of urination is no good because it changed a symptom.

188
00:27:51,346 --> 00:28:02,617
The frequent urination in the night most probably is due a little swelling of the prostate gland.

189
00:28:04,146 --> 00:28:29,452
Now with this it can be less by different other factors except of Elec. Verb. did nothing

190
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:47,105
and also Chin-s. did absolutely nothing. Here we are facing the same problem, exactly.

191
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:59,662
No effect. And we have to take a new decision. That is his chance.

192
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:08,347
What is the decision? Does anybody have an idea?

193
00:29:10,668 --> 00:29:21,147
Show me the symptoms that you have taken and I will give you my idea.

194
00:29:31,387 --> 00:29:52,652
I think fear of high places you have to put it twice at least. Or vertigo high place?

195
00:29:54,188 --> 00:30:01,102
– I don’t get vertigo just fear.

196
00:30:01,612 --> 00:30:11,067
– Pain burning in the left side, thirst for large quantities,

197
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:19,265
frequent urination in the night, falling asleep jerking of the extremities on falling asleep,

198
00:30:20,312 --> 00:30:36,328
restlessness of legs, perspiration in the night. Artificial light aggravation.

199
00:30:36,428 --> 00:30:45,132
It’s interesting that we have this symptom and we look upon that. Show me the symptom.

200
00:30:45,388 --> 00:30:51,151
Which are the remedies that have been recorded as having strong aggravation?

201
00:30:51,427 --> 00:30:57,551
Phos., Puls., Merc., Lyc., Con., Dros., Calc., Glon.

202
00:31:06,787 --> 00:31:42,627
Now you know the remedy I am going to give. Glon. Why? Show me Glon.

203
00:31:46,978 --> 00:32:41,746
Fifth… Perspiration in the night. Put it in cervical region. Show me why Glon.

204
00:33:00,184 --> 00:33:19,384
Do you like Glon.? He comes from Sweden where Glon. was discovered? Norway? It’s close!

205
00:33:19,907 --> 00:33:30,147
– I just wanted to say that my health when it went bad it started with terrible migraines.

206
00:33:31,666 --> 00:33:37,204
– I was joking about Glon., don’t make it serious now!

207
00:33:37,304 --> 00:33:40,668
So I was thinking uh-oh he is going to give me Glon.!

208
00:33:40,943 --> 00:33:45,293
Probably I will be getting these terrible headaches back!

209
00:33:48,623 --> 00:33:59,106
– I was joking because Glon. is much worse with heat! Cannot stand at all heat.

210
00:33:59,624 --> 00:34:09,103
Of course we know the sensitivity to sunlight but this is not your case.

211
00:34:09,346 --> 00:34:18,063
You are a chilly person and hate cold weather, especially cold, wet weather.

212
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:27,266
– I love the sunlight.
– So how I can give you Glon.?

213
00:34:31,324 --> 00:34:36,226
I told you I play games because I make you think!

214
00:34:41,103 --> 00:34:46,466
Once we forget about electricity we have to go back to basics.

215
00:34:46,733 --> 00:34:51,068
What are the basics here? He is chilly, fear of high places,

216
00:34:51,343 --> 00:35:04,653
worse cold and wet, he is also sensitive to light which paradoxically we see Calc.

217
00:35:05,423 --> 00:35:13,103
It’s capital. And when I ask him do you perspire in the night he said yes.

218
00:35:13,346 --> 00:35:19,746
This is the area of perspiration of Calcareas, esp. for Calc.

219
00:35:20,013 --> 00:35:34,863
So we have a lot of symptom of Calc. And we cannot go away from it and give Glon. now.

220
00:35:35,106 --> 00:35:45,104
If we give him Calc. and develops eventually the old symptoms of headaches

221
00:35:45,347 --> 00:35:48,174
and especially if he gets warm

222
00:35:48,664 --> 00:35:57,904
and has sensitivity towards weather then we may be thinking of giving him even Glon.

223
00:35:59,184 --> 00:36:07,864
But at the moment his symptoms do not indicate Glon.

224
00:36:08,144 --> 00:36:11,984
in spite of the fact that it may be appearing there.

225
00:36:13,264 --> 00:36:23,504
Terrible headaches may be not Glon. after Calc. but Bell.

226
00:36:24,014 --> 00:36:32,707
As a complementary to Calc. if he develops strong headaches we may be thinking of Bell.

227
00:36:33,225 --> 00:36:39,625
and Bell. He also has red cheeks and looks like Bell.

228
00:36:40,144 --> 00:36:44,494
but at this time we don’t want to give Bell. We want to give Calc.

229
00:36:44,745 --> 00:37:08,304
And please be better! You are so nice and people and people have a placebo effect.

230
00:37:08,547 --> 00:37:21,104
If you see one of my cases… I mistreated according to the class.

231
00:37:21,347 --> 00:37:29,294
The patient was crying for 3 hours and many people of the class got up

232
00:37:29,484 --> 00:37:37,464
and said you have mistreated this case! Because interrupted her.

233
00:37:37,744 --> 00:37:45,144
I said calm down… I wanted to make a decision! I wasn’t playing.

234
00:37:45,424 --> 00:37:53,614
I wanted to cure her so I was quite cutting. .The whole class wanted to kill me.

235
00:37:53,865 --> 00:38:07,184
I said ok. In spite of the knowledge of everybody I have been so nasty to that case,

236
00:38:07,427 --> 00:38:13,994
I will prescribe this remedy 50M. Very difficult case, complicated.

237
00:38:14,094 --> 00:38:19,944
She had taken half of the M.M. I said 50M of that remedy and see what happens.

238
00:38:20,218 --> 00:38:24,548
You will see on video because all this is recorded.

239
00:38:24,823 --> 00:38:28,388
Next time she said I am much better. She was a different person.

240
00:38:28,663 --> 00:38:36,068
So it was not a placebo effect. And here is the proof,

241
00:38:36,343 --> 00:38:44,538
she would like to come back and say the whole class I’m worse

242
00:38:45,028 --> 00:38:48,868
and the whole class would kill me.

243
00:38:49,143 --> 00:38:58,244
Because it’s natural if you can find a better remedy the teacher…

244
00:38:58,344 --> 00:39:02,068
Look what I am! I am a great prescriber!

245
00:39:02,384 --> 00:39:07,945
So, all this students wanted to be better than the teacher.

246
00:39:08,214 --> 00:39:12,724
This is classic, not Classical Homeopathy!

247
00:39:12,824 --> 00:39:23,064
It’s a classic symptom of homeopaths! Wanted to be better than the teacher.

248
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:33,614
Here he comes he likes me very much and he has seen all these cases that are cured...

249
00:39:33,714 --> 00:39:36,948
by me, I stayed like this with no effect...

250
00:39:37,189 --> 00:39:44,374
Because the remedy is wrong. Let’s see now with Calc…

251
00:39:47,188 --> 00:39:55,625
- He talks about 3 divorces and I cannot see emotions.

252
00:39:55,894 --> 00:40:00,745
If I had lost 3 wives I should cry I think!

253
00:40:01,014 --> 00:40:05,865
– It depends if he wanted to lose them all or not!

254
00:40:09,189 --> 00:40:20,772
– I didn’t see any emotion and there is a possibility for Ph-ac. when if you look in the M.M.;

255
00:40:21,026 --> 00:40:29,986
face, burning spots Ph-ac. is the only remedy.

256
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:39,708
– This is not a keynote on which you can ignore all other symptoms

257
00:40:39,972 --> 00:40:46,707
and prescribe on that. But the fact that he lost his wives…

258
00:40:46,948 --> 00:40:53,623
I have lost my wives, I am exhausted, I don’t want to live,

259
00:40:53,864 --> 00:40:58,227
I am totally indifferent to life… It’s a different picture.

260
00:40:58,468 --> 00:41:10,504
Here I can see a man who has practically faced life after losing 3 wives.

261
00:41:11,784 --> 00:41:20,744
Maybe he wanted to lose 2 of them. Maybe the third one he didn’t want to lose.

262
00:41:21,018 --> 00:41:36,627
But the 2 maybe he didn’t mind losing. It’s another way of having a girlfriend.

263
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:44,548
You are married, in the meantime you make a girlfriend and lose your wife.

264
00:41:44,823 --> 00:41:47,898
But whose fault is it?

265
00:41:54,024 --> 00:42:00,947
– Can you give us some reason why you didn’t consider Calc-p.

266
00:42:01,063 --> 00:42:07,863
– On the first place?
– Yes, anyway. Or did you consider it at all?

267
00:42:28,343 --> 00:42:39,347
– One difference is that Calc-p. doesn’t have the problem from high places.

268
00:42:39,588 --> 00:42:45,224
We haven’t seen this. Either very seldom or not at all.

269
00:42:45,747 --> 00:42:52,904
In Calc-p. we also don’t see the perspiration during night

270
00:42:53,178 --> 00:43:05,188
and especially around this area. Also in Calc-p. we have some different desire

271
00:43:05,463 --> 00:43:10,583
and aversions.
– There which I was thinking is Con.

272
00:43:10,824 --> 00:43:15,944
Because fear of high places, snoring, the artificial light aggravates,

273
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:20,723
urination frequent night, and cold weather aggravates.

274
00:43:20,823 --> 00:43:23,984
If you want I’ll repeat. He is better in sunlight,

275
00:43:24,478 --> 00:43:31,664
worse cold wet weather, artificial light aggravates, urination frequent night,

276
00:43:31,907 --> 00:43:34,734
respiration snoring and fear of high places

277
00:43:34,985 --> 00:43:39,344
and also while interviewed there was a constant scraping condition in the larynx.

278
00:43:39,854 --> 00:43:49,065
This is also of Con. While he was talking to you he was constantly clearing his throat.

279
00:43:52,387 --> 00:44:40,904
– What is the position of Con.? So you would give Con. I’ll tell you something.

280
00:44:41,545 --> 00:44:49,744
Though Con. is worse in cold wet weather, he stresses this point

281
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:54,864
and we really have to have a remedy which worse cold and wet.

282
00:44:55,107 --> 00:45:01,264
He stressed that point quite a lot.
– It’s the worst modality.

283
00:45:01,774 --> 00:45:03,544
– And Con. is not there.

284
00:45:03,824 --> 00:45:10,985
Another point which is very important also it’s the perspiration in the night around that area

285
00:45:11,224 --> 00:45:13,964
which we don’t have in Con.

286
00:45:14,064 --> 00:45:29,667
And the third point that in a case of Con. you would have some kind of vertigo lying in bed,

287
00:45:29,934 --> 00:45:36,585
getting up from bed, turning in bed etc. In such a case we expect to see this.

288
00:45:36,824 --> 00:45:46,825
So, don’t forget that all these remedies which are there have his symptoms!

289
00:45:50,904 --> 00:45:59,864
Arg-n. has a lot of his symptoms. Show me how many. Cold, wet weather also…

290
00:46:04,227 --> 00:46:21,586
Why not Arg-n.? Because the remedy has to catch the highlights of the case.

291
00:46:24,018 --> 00:46:32,592
Clearing the mucus of the throat is Calc. but also Med.

292
00:46:34,148 --> 00:46:42,067
Actually the last time, when we repertorized, Med. was coming as the first remedy.

293
00:46:42,339 --> 00:46:50,382
But it was so strong that I really wanted to see whether such a remedy

294
00:46:50,625 --> 00:47:01,496
which needs someone to be very careful to produce because you have to put the sugar very close

295
00:47:01,545 --> 00:47:05,826
to a very great transformer of the electricity

296
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:11,736
where you know really there is electric currents going on through.

297
00:47:17,346 --> 00:47:22,746
If you leave somebody sleep there for a few days I believe

298
00:47:22,987 --> 00:47:27,866
he will become sick under an electric transformer.

299
00:47:32,706 --> 00:47:42,705
A powder there maybe will have some effect in the molecules

300
00:47:42,946 --> 00:47:47,066
and then you can potentize from there.

301
00:47:47,307 --> 00:47:55,405
It is still a question mark for me unless Philip he has related to me a case

302
00:47:55,505 --> 00:48:01,905
that was really impressive and that’s why I tried Elec. for this case.

303
00:48:02,146 --> 00:48:11,265
– I wonder about frequent urination at night he didn’t have the last year.

304
00:48:21,626 --> 00:48:28,785
– Now I have frequent urination at night. I am staying at this camping place

305
00:48:30,586 --> 00:48:37,227
and it’s very inconvenient to get out of this little tent, I have to go many times at night.

306
00:48:40,056 --> 00:48:52,385
– As I said in his case we have to find a remedy which is sensitive to cold and wet,

307
00:48:52,624 --> 00:49:01,584
that has fear of high places, sweat around this area during sleep

308
00:49:02,107 --> 00:49:06,936
and we have to find a remedy which has artificial light aggravation.

309
00:49:07,426 --> 00:49:14,347
Even if we didn’t see Calc. in that rubric or if we did not have that symptom,

310
00:49:14,616 --> 00:49:23,825
still most indicated remedy must be Calc.

311
00:49:24,066 --> 00:49:30,225
– But may I tell you something; Calc-p. has also the fear of high places

312
00:49:30,466 --> 00:49:38,146
and it has something else Calc. doesn’t have. Hawking during speaking is only Calc-p.,

313
00:49:38,426 --> 00:49:43,184
which is also for wet and cold weather.

314
00:49:43,461 --> 00:49:58,544
– It’s not only Calc-p. Where did you find it? Hawking.

315
00:50:01,104 --> 00:50:16,464
There are quite a lot of remedies and a lot of remedies scraping throat.

316
00:50:37,985 --> 00:51:04,611
Med., Caust. also has this. A lot of remedies have this mucus. What did you say about sweets?

317
00:51:09,221 --> 00:51:34,967
– Scandinavians? I prefer Latin type! I like chocolate! That’s another kind.

318
00:51:35,031 --> 00:51:41,985
Sweets, they’re ok. I eat now and then chocolate bar but it’s not a big craving.

319
00:51:46,851 --> 00:52:02,211
– What about Scandinavian sweets? Greek sweets?

320
00:52:02,465 --> 00:52:06,457
– I tried some chocolate with ice cream. Quite good.

321
00:52:07,222 --> 00:52:12,588
– What about fat?
– I don’t like it,

322
00:52:13,106 --> 00:52:22,307
I would throw it far away to the cat.

323
00:52:25,088 --> 00:52:31,788
– What about smoked meat?

324
00:52:32,306 --> 00:52:38,188
– I don’t eat so much meat but I used to like smoked meat.

325
00:52:38,257 --> 00:52:45,106
– What about meat?
– I don’t eat meat. Chicken

326
00:52:45,347 --> 00:52:47,566
– Eggs?
– I like eggs.

327
00:52:47,666 --> 00:52:52,246
– Fish?
– Quite alright.

328
00:52:53,565 --> 00:52:56,697
– Now you are a vegetarian?

329
00:52:56,846 --> 00:53:01,773
– Semi because it’s too inconvenient being full.

330
00:53:02,024 --> 00:53:03,548
– So you can eat some chicken.

331
00:53:03,823 --> 00:53:16,348
– And fish, turkey. Smoked turkey is fine. Or lamb.

332
00:53:16,866 --> 00:53:21,986
If I am very hungry I eat everything.

333
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:50,908
– Ok. Calc. 200C. Take it immediately, now and see if there is any reaction.
