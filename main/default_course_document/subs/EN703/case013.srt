1
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:25,586
Jenny first came to see on the 13th February this year.

2
00:00:25,827 --> 00:00:42,297
Jenny had M.E., myalgic encephalomyelitis and she previously for 10 years had antibiotics almost every day.

3
00:00:42,546 --> 00:00:48,946
– So many years? And you’re still alive?
– Sort of.

4
00:00:49,977 --> 00:00:55,862
– Then Jenny realized this wasn’t good and went to see a homeopath in Liverpool

5
00:00:56,108 --> 00:01:00,707
and after 2 years Jenny was given a lot of remedies.

6
00:01:00,982 --> 00:01:06,348
– Let me ask her first. Why were you given antibiotics constantly?

7
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:13,266
– The symptom I presented to my doctor was just acne.

8
00:01:14,028 --> 00:01:17,106
– Therefore you were given antibiotics; for acne.

9
00:01:17,347 --> 00:01:20,697
– Low dose antibiotics. It was about 8 years.

10
00:01:21,187 --> 00:01:29,142
– I understand now. She received a lot of remedies. What remedies can you give us the list?

11
00:01:29,657 --> 00:01:48,858
– Thuja 12C, aqua pura, Carc. 200C, Gels. 200C, Ph-ac. 30C., Sep. 30C.

12
00:01:50,387 --> 00:01:57,028
Then when the skin aggravated she was given Sulph. 30C., Sil. 30C.,

13
00:01:57,303 --> 00:02:11,624
Hepar 200C., Ph-ac. 30C., Merc. 30C. but no results and then in March last year Jenny received Carc. 1M

14
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:19,304
and a combination of remedy of Sulph. Sil., Car-v. 9X together for 5 days.

15
00:02:20,858 --> 00:02:42,103
Then she had Puls. 30C., Pod. 200C., Sulph., Carc. 1M again

16
00:02:42,344 --> 00:02:53,107
and she also had some time in the last 2 years Ign. 200C

17
00:02:53,864 --> 00:03:11,543
and for acute episodes Hep. And Hyper., Pyrog. and Sil. Also Ph-ac. and Gels.

18
00:03:11,784 --> 00:03:25,348
– I think that’s it!
- I took her case and I took her symptoms.

19
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:41,219
I’ll tell you the remedies. Nat-m. 1LM. There was an improvement and then a relapse.

20
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:51,706
First of all she had very severe headaches which were very bad and I gave Bry. 30C.

21
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:56,826
– After Nat-m. 1LM there was severe headache and you gave Bry.

22
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:10,906
– The headaches disappeared with Bry. immediately and then I waited and needed to give Nat-m. 5LM.

23
00:04:11,424 --> 00:04:22,426
– I had 2LM, then 3LM and then 5LM.
– I waited until there was a relapse cause there was improvement

24
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:32,420
and then when it began to go I gave the next LM. So we got to 5LM and again an improvement

25
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:40,610
and then the picture changed, Jenny was telling me that any kind of mental exertion was impossible

26
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:47,264
and the mental exertion really made her ill. Do you want to describe?

27
00:04:47,508 --> 00:04:54,890
– I’d always been troubled by mental exertion, I’ve always been a bother but by it really did become very severe.

28
00:04:56,468 --> 00:05:02,106
Just even thinking caused great pain in my brain.

29
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:09,540
I can’t remember what the pain was I seem to remember there was a pressing on my brain.

30
00:05:10,548 --> 00:05:15,200
– Any effort?
– Any effort whatsoever.

31
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:20,930
– Just give me an idea. Reading a story would be an effort?

32
00:05:20,984 --> 00:05:26,966
– Just a sentence, just to look at a book with words was painful.

33
00:05:27,066 --> 00:05:28,127
– That was an effort?
– Yes.

34
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:30,028
– Causing headache?
– Yes.

35
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:32,588
– Now? Still?

36
00:05:32,857 --> 00:05:37,708
– I still have but it’s a different sensation in my head.

37
00:05:37,977 --> 00:05:43,587
For some periods of time I can read, other times I’m quite aversed to it.

38
00:05:44,108 --> 00:05:46,937
– I prescribed for that condition.
– What did you prescribe?

39
00:05:47,186 --> 00:05:53,827
– I gave Pic-ac. and that was beneficial. That made a difference.

40
00:05:54,102 --> 00:06:04,342
And I kept with the Pic-ac. until the improvement leveled off and then I went back to Nat-m. 30C.

41
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:13,548
We had 30C every time with a relapse.

42
00:06:13,817 --> 00:06:20,117
– I’ve written down exactly what’s been happening cause I can’t remember.

43
00:06:20,217 --> 00:06:24,247
– So your memory is very bad?
– It’s not that my memory is bad,

44
00:06:24,347 --> 00:06:29,987
it’s just that things changed so much from day to day.

45
00:06:30,262 --> 00:06:35,535
When I take remedies I don’t know what’s happening. I just have to make notes.

46
00:06:35,786 --> 00:06:47,545
My short-term memory can be quite bad though I find it quite hard to retain information being told me

47
00:06:48,068 --> 00:07:06,745
and then I might hear it but it doesn’t register. After I took the first Nat-m. I started to deteriorate,

48
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:14,948
I think it was about 2 weeks afterwards. I was told to get a second one

49
00:07:16,179 --> 00:07:22,979
and when I did I started having a lot of discharge.

50
00:07:23,225 --> 00:07:27,827
– From the vagina?
– Yes and the rectum.

51
00:07:33,465 --> 00:07:37,828
– Discharge of liquid?
– Like egg-white.

52
00:07:38,067 --> 00:07:41,392
– From rectum also?
– Yes.

53
00:07:42,948 --> 00:07:46,512
– And it was very offensive from the vagina?

54
00:07:46,788 --> 00:07:47,907
– No smell.
– Neither?

55
00:07:48,174 --> 00:08:04,024
– No smell at all. No discomfort.
– Were you examined by the doctor to see

56
00:08:04,304 --> 00:08:07,625
what happens in rectum whether you had a kind of a tumor or?

57
00:08:07,864 --> 00:08:14,954
- I have been about 2 years ago.
– Was it painful when they examined you?

58
00:08:15,054 --> 00:08:19,986
– Not at all.
– What did they say this discharge was?

59
00:08:20,258 --> 00:08:25,106
– At that time I didn’t have discharge. I never had discharge.

60
00:08:25,378 --> 00:08:28,946
I’ve only had discharge since I’ve been taking the remedies.

61
00:08:29,987 --> 00:08:39,704
In fact when I first took the 1LM I had discharge as well. And with the Pic-ac.

62
00:08:39,951 --> 00:08:46,866
and when I got the Nat-m. 30C.
– The discharge continued.

63
00:08:47,646 --> 00:08:51,343
– For about 4 days.
– Not now?

64
00:08:51,586 --> 00:08:56,463
– Not now. Just when I first took the remedy.

65
00:09:02,863 --> 00:09:09,263
When the discharge began I started feeling a lot better again.

66
00:09:10,786 --> 00:09:16,943
– Now she is taking Nat-m.?

67
00:09:17,453 --> 00:09:22,573
– Well, I repeated when the improvement started to go down.

68
00:09:22,824 --> 00:09:26,146
When the improvement stopped and symptoms came back I gave one more.

69
00:09:26,413 --> 00:09:29,468
– What potency?
– 30C.

70
00:09:30,748 --> 00:09:37,506
– The last time that you took Nat-m. there was a discharge?

71
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:44,145
– There was the second time I took it but since then it has been away.

72
00:09:44,245 --> 00:09:58,672
I relapsed again and I was told to then start plussing to shake the 30C in water

73
00:09:59,705 --> 00:10:10,468
and I was told to do that until I started feeling better which I did until yesterday afternoon.

74
00:10:10,979 --> 00:10:14,032
– And the discharge started again yesterday afternoon?

75
00:10:14,308 --> 00:10:30,672
– No it was Sunday, Saturday evening until yesterday afternoon. The 30C in water plusing.

76
00:10:30,948 --> 00:10:36,307
– And no discharge appeared?
– Not that time.

77
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:45,786
– From the beginning the gums started to discharge.

78
00:10:50,144 --> 00:10:58,850
– Discharging what?
– It was a white liquid.

79
00:10:59,104 --> 00:11:03,970
– Like milk?
– Milky-white.

80
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:22,388
– You know that if you are treated homeopathically,

81
00:11:22,906 --> 00:11:29,306
do you realize that you are going to get back all the acne?

82
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:44,666
– Last year when I was given a couple of remedies my skin was horrendous, the acne was excruciating.

83
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,590
– What remedies had you taken by that time?

84
00:11:47,988 --> 00:12:00,290
– When the acne flared up I was given Carc. Sorry I was given Carc.1M

85
00:12:00,544 --> 00:12:06,805
and a combination remedy and then my skin...

86
00:12:06,905 --> 00:12:13,715
- And then what happened after that? You let it alone or you took another remedy?

87
00:12:13,815 --> 00:12:24,825
– That was when I was given Sulph., Sil., Merc., Ph-ac. after the eruption.

88
00:12:25,066 --> 00:12:29,665
– And then this combination took it back again?

89
00:12:29,945 --> 00:12:35,206
– No it just kept coming. Nothing happened to the skin, it kept coming and coming.

90
00:12:35,306 --> 00:12:40,695
– And how it became better?
– It just on its own over time.

91
00:12:40,944 --> 00:12:47,636
It’s a lot better now from what it was. I could barely talk when it first came up

92
00:12:47,736 --> 00:12:53,346
because it felt like I had acid felt on my face it would burn, it was violent.

93
00:12:57,976 --> 00:13:06,326
– During the time of this flair up you felt better in general?

94
00:13:06,426 --> 00:13:11,787
– When my skin was extremely bad I felt very ill.

95
00:13:13,336 --> 00:13:16,666
And that would go on for about 10 days,

96
00:13:16,907 --> 00:13:26,136
2 weeks and then for another 10 days my skin would clear and I would feel virtually normal

97
00:13:26,385 --> 00:13:29,466
and then I go down and then I was up and down like that,

98
00:13:29,707 --> 00:13:43,266
from March last year up until December and then in December I just went slowly down and down

99
00:13:43,546 --> 00:13:46,006
but the severity of the acne was better.

100
00:13:46,106 --> 00:13:51,226
– With what symptoms you went down? Lack of energy, lack of concentration?

101
00:13:51,985 --> 00:14:07,866
– The fatigue definitely and the energy was awful. Sleeping 12-13 hours and no refreshing.

102
00:14:08,107 --> 00:14:18,106
Sleeping in the afternoon heaviness of the head, dullness, lethargy, apathy,

103
00:14:18,347 --> 00:14:26,296
listlessness, depressed, no sense of humor, headaches.

104
00:14:26,545 --> 00:14:33,707
– All these symptoms were there before the flair up?
– Yes.

105
00:14:34,225 --> 00:14:42,305
– So all of them came back?
– But worse.

106
00:14:42,572 --> 00:14:54,862
And every time they came they were severe as the last time.

107
00:14:58,427 --> 00:15:06,382
– What happened with Sep.? You remember when you took Sep.? Was there any reaction?

108
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:15,752
– Sep. my homeopath told me at the time was just to tackle period pains.

109
00:15:15,852 --> 00:15:20,462
– But do you remember anything happening with Sep.?
– No.

110
00:15:22,252 --> 00:15:32,225
She said when I had pains take the Sep. I really felt no difference at all.

111
00:15:32,392 --> 00:15:38,107
And there was so many other remedies at the same time, I wouldn’t know what was doing what.

112
00:15:38,382 --> 00:15:44,012
I really couldn’t give an accurate feedback.

113
00:15:53,742 --> 00:16:01,047
– You don’t have to report anything I see very huge package of symptoms.

114
00:16:01,147 --> 00:16:13,947
Do you discover any peculiar symptoms of hers?
– Just now?

115
00:16:14,222 --> 00:16:17,025
– During the time of the treatment.

116
00:16:17,292 --> 00:16:23,182
– I found the case very simple. I’ll tell you the rubrics I took.

117
00:16:24,328 --> 00:16:30,067
Ailments from love disappointment, very strong, mind weeping when only alone,

118
00:16:31,347 --> 00:16:37,988
sympathetic, fastidious, salt desire very strong.

119
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:45,427
– You still have salt desire?
– I like salt. I don’t crave it. But I do like salt.

120
00:16:45,668 --> 00:16:50,905
– You put extra salt in your food? You put.
– Yes definitely.

121
00:16:51,152 --> 00:16:57,064
– Desire for open air and aggravation from the sun and dreams visionary.

122
00:16:59,383 --> 00:17:07,063
– You mean you see the future?
– No.

123
00:17:18,067 --> 00:17:25,988
I can’t really remember any incidents but there have been times in my waking

124
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:31,383
while an image comes into my head and the event happens,

125
00:17:31,624 --> 00:17:40,068
I’ll think of a person or a thing and that person or that thing will appear quite often,

126
00:17:40,343 --> 00:17:45,704
when I haven’t seen for a while.

127
00:17:45,978 --> 00:17:52,627
And sometimes I’ll have written some thing, or drawn some thing

128
00:17:52,868 --> 00:18:00,227
or perhaps mentioned something to somebody and that will happen.

129
00:18:00,466 --> 00:18:07,631
It happened today actually. 2 days before we flew up here I was doing some drawing.

130
00:18:09,944 --> 00:18:14,546
It was a paper bag which had some pattern on,

131
00:18:14,818 --> 00:18:19,666
the crisscross patterns and I just liked the colors in it

132
00:18:19,938 --> 00:18:26,338
and I did myself and there was a big mix with our apartment room

133
00:18:26,584 --> 00:18:31,458
when we arrived last night and we had to move to a different room this morning

134
00:18:31,704 --> 00:18:37,586
and there on the table there was this tartan and all the same colors,

135
00:18:37,858 --> 00:18:46,818
the same pattern and that happened a lot to me.

136
00:18:47,311 --> 00:18:56,271
– You take milk or you don’t like it?
– I don’t eat dairy in general.

137
00:18:56,547 --> 00:19:01,144
– What about milk in specific?
– I wouldn’t choose to drink milk as milk.

138
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:04,984
I would eat it in porridge or cereal.

139
00:19:12,664 --> 00:19:14,980
– Are you married?
–No.

140
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,786
– You’re 25 now.
– Yes.

141
00:19:21,108 --> 00:19:22,906
 – How is your sexual desire?

142
00:19:23,424 --> 00:19:29,824
– I really don’t have any. I usually am very sexual person but...

143
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:34,180
- At the moment, no interest.
– Very very little.

144
00:19:34,944 --> 00:19:38,530
Very odd occasions but... very little.

145
00:19:40,308 --> 00:19:46,708
– As a child you remember having leucorrhea?

146
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:56,450
– No that I can remember or know of. I may have done but I can’t really remember.

147
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:10,266
– Jenny’s mother is here so she can confirm.

148
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:25,626
– You say you sleep 13 hours and you wake up in between or you can sleep straightaway 12 hours?

149
00:20:26,144 --> 00:20:29,730
– At this very moment I’m not sleeping that length of time.

150
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:40,986
I’m actually  sleeping 8-9 hours. And I haven’t slept that long for quite a few weeks now.

151
00:20:41,504 --> 00:20:47,650
But yes I do wake up through the night sometimes. Not every night.

152
00:20:48,148 --> 00:20:54,304
– But you wake up always unrefreshed?
– Always.

153
00:20:55,828 --> 00:21:01,730
Some days are better than others but I’m never bright and awake.

154
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:13,250
– Most of the time you feel depressed?
– Yes.

155
00:21:13,504 --> 00:21:20,666
– And what do you want to do? Want to stay alone?
– Yes. I want to be on my own.

156
00:21:21,184 --> 00:21:22,980
– That’s definite.

157
00:21:23,226 --> 00:21:31,668
– Yes. And even coming out here to a new country, different environment, I’m not happy with that.

158
00:21:32,186 --> 00:21:37,824
I want to be in familiar surroundings that I know, that I feel safe in.

159
00:21:38,068 --> 00:21:42,944
– And better alone.
– Definitely.

160
00:21:48,064 --> 00:21:59,066
– The last week or month the desire for salt is less, the same or more?
– About the same.

161
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:01,626
– The desire for sweets?

162
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:12,130
– I have moments where I want very sickly sweets while normally I don’t like to eat sweet things.

163
00:22:12,384 --> 00:22:20,064
Normally a little piece of chocolate is fine but there are moments where I really want the sugar.

164
00:22:20,308 --> 00:22:27,490
And quite often there’s another desire for sugar but that’s a different feeling,

165
00:22:27,988 --> 00:22:32,347
is when I am extremely fatigued and I feel I am looking for energy

166
00:22:32,611 --> 00:22:39,265
and I always crave carbohydrates.

167
00:22:39,781 --> 00:22:46,427
– Your nails are brittle?
– My nails break easily but are not brittle.

168
00:22:46,945 --> 00:22:56,421
They feel very thin and scratchy. And they always crack at the sides, the angle.

169
00:23:00,507 --> 00:23:06,384
– Premenstrually you feel depressed, angry?
– I am not different premenstrually.

170
00:23:06,661 --> 00:23:14,064
I get tenderness in my breast but other than that no.
– No swelling?

171
00:23:14,587 --> 00:23:28,144
– Yes swelling and tenderness. It’s quite painful but no mood change really.

172
00:23:30,704 --> 00:23:37,627
But my last period, premenstrually there was less tenderness than I’ve had

173
00:23:38,145 --> 00:23:43,011
and I’m actually premenstrual now, there is a lot less than it usually is.

174
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:47,362
My period wasn’t as heavy either.

175
00:23:53,505 --> 00:24:05,264
– Which are the worst symptoms for you at this moment? What makes you feel worse?

176
00:24:06,305 --> 00:24:09,891
– I couldn’t distinguish between a couple of them.

177
00:24:10,384 --> 00:24:23,461
I’d say the fatigue and the general malaise, heaviness, dullness through my body and my mind.

178
00:24:25,744 --> 00:24:32,427
– Do you sometimes attend a discussion

179
00:24:32,945 --> 00:24:38,306
and you feel that you don’t understand what they are talking about?

180
00:24:39,586 --> 00:24:47,787
– If I’m very tired at the time I find it very hard to focus then and follow what they say.

181
00:24:48,056 --> 00:24:54,946
I can only watch, a simple film on the TV, anything complex I just don’t get it at all.

182
00:24:55,467 --> 00:24:59,307
I wouldn’t say it’s lack of intelligence.

183
00:25:01,105 --> 00:25:07,746
– Have you studied something?
– I did a 4-year teacher training degree.

184
00:25:08,267 --> 00:25:17,496
– Have you worked as a teacher?
– I do a little bit of piano teaching, not for what I trained.

185
00:25:17,745 --> 00:25:29,265
No, I haven’t done any work. Never. I left university and then I was really sick.

186
00:25:29,786 --> 00:25:37,976
I gave up. I think I kept willing myself on to get the degree and then I just collapsed.

187
00:25:38,466 --> 00:25:40,536
I don’t know how I made it through.

188
00:25:40,785 --> 00:25:49,227
– Do you perspire a lot or not all?
– I have been since the remedy, I had a lot of perspiration.

189
00:25:49,509 --> 00:25:52,865
– When? In the night in the bed or during the day?

190
00:25:53,104 --> 00:25:56,187
– As soon as I wake up in the morning right through the day.

191
00:25:56,705 --> 00:26:01,571
– Early in the morning? From the bed?
– Yes. When I get out of bed.

192
00:26:02,587 --> 00:26:07,184
– You start perspiring?
– Yes. But not every day.

193
00:26:08,987 --> 00:26:15,461
– But do you perspire with the least exertion or under certain conditions, when anxious?

194
00:26:18,021 --> 00:26:21,584
– It probably gets worse when I become anxious.

195
00:26:21,861 --> 00:26:26,465
But I can perspire just sitting on my own in my bedroom for no reason.

196
00:26:27,491 --> 00:26:33,627
– Do you perspire during sleep?
– No that I know of.

197
00:26:35,171 --> 00:26:41,825
– So you perspire mostly after you wake up in the morning.

198
00:26:42,341 --> 00:26:46,181
– Yes. From when I get up in the morning.

199
00:26:57,701 --> 00:27:03,331
– Do you have any fears?
– Only of the sea.

200
00:27:09,221 --> 00:27:13,307
– Be drowned?
– No I just wouldn’t like to come in it.

201
00:27:13,825 --> 00:27:16,385
I used to as a child but I as I got older...

202
00:27:17,147 --> 00:27:21,505
- But are you afraid of the sea to swim?
– Yes. I can watch it.

203
00:27:22,021 --> 00:27:25,584
I could probably paddle in it. But I wouldn’t swim in it.

204
00:27:26,107 --> 00:27:27,387
– You don’t go further.
– No.

205
00:27:27,651 --> 00:27:29,701
– Why, you had an experience?
– No.

206
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:38,145
– Anything else you are afraid of?  Animals?
– No, I love animals.

207
00:27:38,661 --> 00:27:46,587
– Snakes?
– I wouldn’t choose to have one on my neck

208
00:27:47,621 --> 00:28:05,264
 but I don’t dislike them. And I hate cruelty to animals more than I do to humans.

209
00:28:09,627 --> 00:28:16,027
– At this state that you are now, do you have feelings or your feelings are also gone?

210
00:28:17,825 --> 00:28:24,741
– At this very moment I am anxious. Because of this situation.

211
00:28:25,251 --> 00:28:29,091
– I’m talking about the last 2 months.

212
00:28:29,584 --> 00:28:36,261
The feelings are there or you feel you are not really interested actually in anything,

213
00:28:36,771 --> 00:28:39,824
nothing can excite you?

214
00:28:40,347 --> 00:28:42,384
– Very little does excite me now.

215
00:28:42,907 --> 00:28:47,265
I can’t be very simulated by anything, even the things I used to love.

216
00:28:48,027 --> 00:29:06,704
I suppose my most predominant feel is despondency and hopelessness because I feel so ill all the time.

217
00:29:06,981 --> 00:29:15,171
I’m beginning to think maybe it’s too late to get better.

218
00:29:15,425 --> 00:29:19,011
But then there’s always something inside me that thinks;

219
00:29:19,504 --> 00:29:27,184
you’ve survived this and to survive what I have put into my body

220
00:29:27,461 --> 00:29:32,581
there must be a will to live somewhere, there must be some soul vitality to pull me through.

221
00:29:33,091 --> 00:29:38,981
And I desperately want to because I think there is a lot of work in the world I want to do.

222
00:29:39,491 --> 00:29:47,664
– Who has diagnosed your M.E.?
– I can’t remember. I’ve seen so many doctors.

223
00:29:48,187 --> 00:29:53,571
It was actually a consultant who was specialized in M.E.

224
00:29:53,825 --> 00:30:10,465
He doesn’t do anything for the people he just specializes in it. That was last March.

225
00:30:18,145 --> 00:30:28,748
- March 2000.
– Eating makes you feel better actually? Can you say?

226
00:30:28,987 --> 00:30:30,785
Or only in the evening?

227
00:30:31,052 --> 00:30:36,667
– I don’t know whether it is in the evening or because the meal’s warm.

228
00:30:41,025 --> 00:30:53,582
But I think definitely in the evening but I think in the day

229
00:30:53,825 --> 00:30:58,188
if I eat lunch I will feel slightly better.

230
00:31:01,772 --> 00:31:07,148
– There are any other symptoms that you want to add?
– Bowels.

231
00:31:08,172 --> 00:31:25,068
– My stool is generally very loose, mushy and quite a strain to go. I have to push.

232
00:31:26,587 --> 00:31:34,267
– In spite of being soft?
– Yes. Not always but sometimes.

233
00:31:34,542 --> 00:31:47,067
But last week for a few days after taking the second Nat-m.,

234
00:31:47,585 --> 00:31:53,505
I was going to the toilet 2-3 times a day. More easily.

235
00:31:57,584 --> 00:32:03,227
And since then it has been easy, it’s still very loose but it has been easier.

236
00:32:03,491 --> 00:32:11,171
– This love disappointment that he mentioned was a big shock for you or you were expecting it?

237
00:32:11,941 --> 00:32:20,385
– It wasn’t a shock because I ended it. But I regretted it afterwards.

238
00:32:20,624 --> 00:32:27,547
It took me so long. I was only 15, 16.

239
00:32:28,065 --> 00:32:32,144
– And you were so much involved with it?
– Yes.

240
00:32:32,667 --> 00:32:41,104
– Why did you end it? Can you tell?
– I can’t remember. I think I felt stifle, it was pushing me down,

241
00:32:41,381 --> 00:32:47,011
pressed, I wanted to be free and do my own thing and I felt quite pushed out.

242
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:59,547
But I regretted it. And since taking the remedy I just keep dreaming about him every week.

243
00:33:00,065 --> 00:33:05,467
And I never dreamed about him before but I do now.

244
00:33:05,742 --> 00:33:11,867
And I wake up and it’s like all happened again. I feel sick to my stomach.

245
00:33:14,702 --> 00:33:23,905
–Ok.
– George can I ask Jenny one more thing? Might be helpful.

246
00:33:25,185 --> 00:33:31,468
When you said you that after you see George you’d work or give up.

247
00:33:31,982 --> 00:33:37,612
Do you feel like you’ve something to say?
– I feel this is my last hope.

248
00:33:38,107 --> 00:33:44,545
I feel after this there’s no other avenue I can try because I have tried so many.

249
00:33:47,867 --> 00:33:53,251
– With the problem that you have there is no other solution!

250
00:33:54,267 --> 00:34:02,211
– From the little I know Homeopathy I believe this is the only solution if there’s one at all.

251
00:34:02,465 --> 00:34:11,664
Either that or I need a miracle. But I feel almost peace.

252
00:34:11,941 --> 00:34:21,411
If you told me I can’t help you I would walk away with a peace knowing that I’ve tried,

253
00:34:21,904 --> 00:34:24,741
I fall long and hard.

254
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:38,544
– Was she inside the class?
– No. I can just give up and resign myself to it.

255
00:34:39,067 --> 00:34:52,901
– This is not such a hopeless case. It’s not.
– She also had feelings of anger.

256
00:34:53,147 --> 00:35:00,827
– Against the guy or against everybody?
– Not towards him at all. Against doctors.

257
00:35:01,345 --> 00:35:06,704
– Rightly so!
– Doctors with small ‘d’.

258
00:35:06,981 --> 00:35:09,264
– Because they were not able to do anything for you.

259
00:35:09,787 --> 00:35:15,171
– No, because I think that I am here because of what they’ve done.

260
00:35:17,467 --> 00:35:22,587
– It’s not the fault of the doctors, it’s the fault of the system. It’s much broader.

261
00:35:23,105 --> 00:35:27,461
If somebody gives antibiotics for 10 years,

262
00:35:27,971 --> 00:35:32,065
it is because the system allows him and tells him that’s what you have to do.

263
00:35:32,304 --> 00:35:36,144
– But having said that I kept coming back to my doctors with more symptoms

264
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:40,771
and say I am concerned about taking all these tablets. Are they safe?

265
00:35:41,025 --> 00:35:45,891
Are they causing any problems? They said no it’s fine, you’re ok.

266
00:35:46,384 --> 00:35:50,747
Just take some more and take this and take that. And at the end I had enough.

267
00:35:51,265 --> 00:35:58,427
But I also know that I made the decision to take them as well.

268
00:35:58,691 --> 00:36:03,547
But I dared with the best of the knowledge that I had at the time

269
00:36:04,065 --> 00:36:09,701
and I put my face on those doctors and I put my life in their hands.

270
00:36:10,211 --> 00:36:19,148
I have let go of the anger now, because there was no point, it was eating me up.

271
00:36:19,387 --> 00:36:26,062
– Also your feeling about being unfair?
– Feeling of being unfair?

272
00:36:27,342 --> 00:36:39,105
– I feel as though, I know am a good person and I know I have talents and I know I have strengths.

273
00:36:39,628 --> 00:36:42,945
I feel as though I could do a lot for the world.

274
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:48,065
I want to do so much for others, for myself,

275
00:36:48,332 --> 00:36:56,268
and I get so frustrated I can’t and at times it does feel very unfair.

276
00:37:03,704 --> 00:37:08,067
– What are you interested at the moment mostly?
– Getting better.

277
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:18,031
– What religion you are?
– I don’t practice a religion.

278
00:37:18,818 --> 00:37:23,151
But I believe in the power of the universe.

279
00:37:23,427 --> 00:37:28,786
– Did you try to find some solution in spiritual movements?
– Yes.

280
00:37:29,304 --> 00:37:36,738
I’ve tried spiritual healing, going to church, talking to God, praying,

281
00:37:36,984 --> 00:37:42,866
non-stop praying, I still pray but most to the world.

282
00:37:43,384 --> 00:37:50,307
– Were you connected at a certain moment with spiritual people?

283
00:37:50,818 --> 00:37:55,427
– I wouldn’t say I was connected I had a contact with

284
00:37:55,666 --> 00:38:01,827
but I never became part of a religious practice.

285
00:38:03,346 --> 00:38:06,947
– Did you ever thought of committing suicide?

286
00:38:07,458 --> 00:38:13,858
– I’ve thought of it but I really don’t think I could.

287
00:38:15,907 --> 00:38:24,591
Not because I think it’s coward’s way out. I know people would say that it is.

288
00:38:25,378 --> 00:38:29,987
But unless you’ve been through something extremely bad and you’re not getting better,

289
00:38:30,226 --> 00:38:38,947
I don’t think it’s a coward’s way out. Because this is torture.

290
00:38:39,458 --> 00:38:44,067
– After this affair you never had another?
– Yes.

291
00:38:45,858 --> 00:38:53,784
– At the moment you have an affair?
- No.

292
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:59,151
– You’re not interested either.
– No. I have nothing to give.

293
00:38:59,427 --> 00:39:03,267
That was with my last relationship. I ended it.

294
00:39:03,506 --> 00:39:12,984
It was 5 years ago because I was getting so ill. I just had nothing to give anymore.

295
00:39:13,231 --> 00:39:21,426
I couldn’t do anything. I couldn’t go out, enjoy myself. So, it’s pointless.

296
00:39:22,467 --> 00:39:27,064
– Thank you! We’ll analyze your case.

297
00:39:33,711 --> 00:39:37,058
Here we have a difficult case.

298
00:39:38,066 --> 00:39:46,511
A lot of remedies have been given and we have come to the point

299
00:39:47,026 --> 00:39:51,384
where it is difficult to decide what to do further.

300
00:39:55,747 --> 00:40:01,104
What is the right thing to do with the case?

301
00:40:02,185 --> 00:40:06,264
– I say perhaps just to give Nux-v. and Sulph. to clear the case.

302
00:40:06,544 --> 00:40:11,384
If she’s had a lot of homeopathic treatment and start again.

303
00:40:12,664 --> 00:40:17,545
– You don’t say things like that in the class!

304
00:40:24,184 --> 00:40:29,827
There is not such a thing as giving something to clear up.

305
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:35,984
The only thing is when you have enough symptoms to prescribe on a remedy,

306
00:40:36,494 --> 00:40:41,104
you prescribe that remedy and then this remedy will clear up the situation

307
00:40:41,347 --> 00:40:43,384
and will give you a better picture.

308
00:40:43,664 --> 00:40:51,064
If you mechanically decide that in order to clear up a case you give this or that,

309
00:40:51,854 --> 00:40:59,024
or even worse combination remedies what you are going to do is to further confuse the case.

310
00:40:59,534 --> 00:41:09,774
So the case is already confused. Because we don’t have much time I will analyze the case myself

311
00:41:11,305 --> 00:41:17,705
and I will have to say this that the case has been given several remedies

312
00:41:17,944 --> 00:41:24,624
as you hear without giving the correct remedy.

313
00:41:27,427 --> 00:41:33,304
And as you know in order to cure such cases like this one which has been created

314
00:41:33,584 --> 00:41:39,465
of course due to the long time taking of antibiotics

315
00:41:39,984 --> 00:41:50,985
and as you know the M.E. has several names being given.

316
00:41:51,224 --> 00:41:57,904
Chronic fatigue syndrome, also post viral syndrome

317
00:42:00,707 --> 00:42:09,424
because they noticed that after some virus for which they had given antibiotics this syndrome appears.

318
00:42:09,934 --> 00:42:16,585
That is a syndrome which has come as an epidemic in our societies

319
00:42:16,824 --> 00:42:24,610
because of excess use of chemical drugs. But we shout, nobody hears.

320
00:42:25,108 --> 00:42:30,228
Nobody wants to take notice and these are the results. We have the cases of that type.

321
00:42:33,306 --> 00:42:38,426
Then this case comes to Homeopathy and the homeopath gives several remedies;

322
00:42:38,944 --> 00:42:46,106
Carc., Sep., Sulph... And there is a time when there is a reaction.

323
00:42:49,946 --> 00:42:57,145
And after the reaction whatever brought the reaction,

324
00:42:57,655 --> 00:43:04,055
several remedies were given to stop the reaction.

325
00:43:04,545 --> 00:43:14,786
After the reaction combination of remedies was given. She said nothing happened.

326
00:43:15,307 --> 00:43:26,065
According to me what happened was that this combination of remedies stopped the reaction

327
00:43:26,306 --> 00:43:33,496
and brought back the situation, the result, the condition.

328
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:37,067
Of course she stopped it after a month or so.

329
00:43:41,425 --> 00:43:47,825
But it is important when she says when I had this flair up I felt normal.

330
00:44:10,347 --> 00:44:16,506
I will tell you the exact situation. She said immediately during the flair up I felt

331
00:44:17,025 --> 00:44:22,145
because of this condition I felt bad. Of course.

332
00:44:22,907 --> 00:44:35,707
She was discharging. But after a period, 10 days, I felt as if I was normal.

333
00:44:36,225 --> 00:44:43,662
Is it correct? Is it in your notes? This is what I am talking about.

334
00:44:43,905 --> 00:44:50,062
During the aggravation period of course they will say they don’t feel good.

335
00:44:50,572 --> 00:44:56,187
But after the aggravation period is down she feels normal.

336
00:44:56,462 --> 00:45:01,068
Felt normal because she had this aggravation.

337
00:45:01,582 --> 00:45:09,262
Therefore because a constant prescription of drugs was given

338
00:45:09,505 --> 00:45:14,892
we are not in the position to know what brought about that reaction.

339
00:45:15,387 --> 00:45:25,091
This reaction in any case was a  curative reaction. And should not have been stopped.

340
00:45:25,345 --> 00:45:36,101
Should have been left alone to continue 1-3 months and prescribe only if you could find the next remedy.

341
00:45:40,451 --> 00:45:45,061
This case is a typical example what happens when you mix remedies.

342
00:45:45,307 --> 00:45:49,665
You don’t know which remedy has done what and you don’t know what to do further.

343
00:45:49,904 --> 00:45:56,304
So this is the situation you will be all the time in cases you don’t know the theory.

344
00:45:56,581 --> 00:45:59,141
You don’t understand what’s going on.

345
00:45:59,387 --> 00:46:02,211
This is the best possible reaction and you stop it.

346
00:46:02,465 --> 00:46:05,541
You give 5 remedies and you stop it. She said nothing happened.

347
00:46:07,067 --> 00:46:10,384
But such a reaction cannot be stopped in 1 or 2 days.

348
00:46:10,661 --> 00:46:16,291
It will stopped in 10-15 days. That’s why she feels nothing happened.

349
00:46:16,545 --> 00:46:22,945
Of course something happened and something very severe happened.

350
00:46:23,461 --> 00:46:28,827
The combination remedies that were given afterwards they stopped this reaction.

351
00:46:29,091 --> 00:46:38,549
Therefore I consider this an unfortunate period and then she comes to Ernest.

352
00:46:40,865 --> 00:46:59,301
Now prescribed correctly on the idea of love disappointment together with the salt,

353
00:47:01,091 --> 00:47:15,171
aversion to sun, the symptoms that he has referred. What is his mistake?

354
00:47:24,624 --> 00:47:28,225
– Bry. for the headache. – No.

355
00:47:31,811 --> 00:47:42,544
His mistake is that in this case, since he was prescribing on the emotional level

356
00:47:42,821 --> 00:47:48,944
the health of this woman was good enough to prescribe a high potency.

357
00:47:49,467 --> 00:47:52,291
He did not prescribe a high potency.

358
00:47:52,784 --> 00:48:05,091
He prescribed 1LM or 2LM these are slow acting remedies and he chooses the right remedy

359
00:48:05,345 --> 00:48:11,984
but he gives it in a very low potency and that’s why you saw this reaction up and down.

360
00:48:13,025 --> 00:48:31,184
But what it is interesting is that the case starts now coming to a more clear situation.

361
00:48:32,741 --> 00:48:48,865
Because he says after Nat-m. a discharge started from the vagina ,from the rectum,

362
00:48:51,941 --> 00:48:59,344
which is milky discharge. That immediately should bring to the mind what remedy?

363
00:49:05,251 --> 00:49:24,187
Carc.? Ign.? Phos.? Ph-ac.? Forget it! Med.? Forget it!

364
00:49:25,731 --> 00:49:39,029
You have given Nat-m. to a case, after Nat-m. you have as a reaction milky discharge from the vagina.

365
00:49:40,827 --> 00:49:51,824
What is the first remedy you are thinking? Chin.? You need re-training!

366
00:49:52,101 --> 00:49:56,944
Sep. The first remedy you have to think is Sep. for God’s sake!

367
00:49:57,467 --> 00:50:04,666
Nat-m. and Sep. are complementary. And after your Nat-m. the organism shows you

368
00:50:04,907 --> 00:50:08,506
that this is the next line of thinking.

369
00:50:09,016 --> 00:50:18,742
Sep. has to be given! But this is very simple.

370
00:50:20,537 --> 00:50:27,702
I am sorry that you do not follow but this is simple. Not only that.

371
00:50:28,466 --> 00:50:35,897
There you investigate that can be a Sep. case. Of course it can be!

372
00:50:36,387 --> 00:50:43,577
She says I have no interest in sex at all. But this is not all.

373
00:50:44,067 --> 00:50:50,742
She says in the evening I feel better. She says when I wake up I perspire.

374
00:50:51,747 --> 00:51:00,217
All these are symptoms of Sep. Not only that, she says I have no feelings.

375
00:51:00,707 --> 00:51:09,426
Nothing to give. This indifference, this lack of stimulation from anything.

376
00:51:09,942 --> 00:51:14,787
Not really stimulated by anything. This is a state of Sep.

377
00:51:21,187 --> 00:51:32,217
- Wants to be alone. – She says it so clearly I just want to be alone.

378
00:51:32,466 --> 00:51:35,788
Then I feel better only when alone.

379
00:51:36,057 --> 00:51:45,508
So if you open your repertories better when alone you will see Sep. is the only capital remedy there.

380
00:51:46,024 --> 00:51:50,903
What else do you need in order to understand this is a Sep. case?

381
00:51:51,144 --> 00:52:15,464
We don’t need anything else. What will you prescribe? Sep. what potency?

382
00:52:19,063 --> 00:52:34,185
You are afraid? 7 o’clock is the party. Don’t be late!

383
00:52:34,704 --> 00:52:41,347
At 10 o’clock I am going to leave! But you can continue.

384
00:52:41,865 --> 00:52:49,545
What are you going to prescribe? Tell me! Raise your hand.

385
00:52:59,267 --> 00:53:06,424
Ernest, be careful!
– 1M.

386
00:53:06,704 --> 00:53:20,504
– Who else? Tell me.
– 10M.

387
00:53:26,147 --> 00:53:45,104
– Somebody 50M? Let’s start from 30C.

388
00:53:45,614 --> 00:53:52,265
Who will prescribe 30C? Nobody. 200C?

389
00:53:55,064 --> 00:54:29,904
1M? 10M? I just want to see. 5. 50M? 2. CM? Nobody. What would you prescribe? 1M.

390
00:54:36,814 --> 00:54:44,984
It’s wrong. Nothing of that is correct.

391
00:54:50,384 --> 00:54:59,344
I persuaded you that this is a case of Sep. and you believed it!

392
00:55:06,505 --> 00:55:11,625
Milky discharge, better in the evening, better alone, no desire for sex.

393
00:55:12,144 --> 00:55:19,824
It’s a typical case of Sep. Yet, it’s not the time to give Sep.

394
00:55:26,734 --> 00:55:36,707
Why? Because Nat-m. has not exhausted its action.
– She has slowly improved.

395
00:55:37,464 --> 00:55:45,144
– Nat-m. has not exhausted its action. Why do we say that?

396
00:55:47,704 --> 00:55:53,104
Because she was given a low potency of Nat-m. with the result

397
00:55:54,384 --> 00:56:04,344
that the discharge was brought out to characterize, define, confirm that this needed Sep.

398
00:56:05,385 --> 00:56:12,547
Now what she says is that she took 30C, no discharge.

399
00:56:14,094 --> 00:56:21,264
That means still is on Nat-m., what she needs is Nat-m.

400
00:56:21,507 --> 00:56:27,145
and when the discharge comes and stays that is the time you enter with Sep.

401
00:56:34,574 --> 00:56:36,624
– I thought she said that the discharge was egg-white...?

402
00:56:37,134 --> 00:56:40,624
– No, she said milky. Are you English?
– No.

403
00:56:42,935 --> 00:56:55,225
– You are not English.
– She said milky from the gums.

404
00:56:56,225 --> 00:57:03,146
– She said milky. Show me what this bloody computer is saying. Show me.

405
00:57:05,465 --> 00:57:09,546
Why you changed it? You changed something again.

406
00:57:09,815 --> 00:57:14,145
Inside it was different. What are you doing?

407
00:57:17,226 --> 00:57:19,786
I told you to leave it like that, how it was inside.

408
00:57:20,304 --> 00:57:29,505
– Ok. Inside was Nat-m. first, Sep. second.
– Thank you. Nat-m. was first and Sep. second.

409
00:57:30,026 --> 00:57:35,415
Close it because I get angry when I see this.

410
00:57:37,706 --> 00:57:41,025
I looked at this and said ok. Let’s go inside.

411
00:57:41,305 --> 00:57:55,626
And then... Ok. But it doesn’t really matter, here we are basing our prescription on facts.

412
00:57:57,424 --> 00:58:06,135
We are expecting from Nat-m. to do certain work. It’s not going to cure the case.

413
00:58:06,625 --> 00:58:11,745
It’s going to open up the case toward Sep.

414
00:58:12,535 --> 00:58:18,666
When the discharge comes and confirms all the other picture.

415
00:58:18,935 --> 00:58:21,226
And  then there is beauty and then you see the results.

416
00:58:21,495 --> 00:58:24,825
And then you see the effect of homeopathic treatment.

417
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:34,026
Otherwise forget it you just throw remedies here and there without really any effect.

418
00:58:37,866 --> 00:58:52,985
Nat-m. therefore first 50M, then discharge then Sep. 10M easily.

419
00:59:05,264 --> 00:59:14,224
Something that I want to tell you is concerning the repertory. This repertory information.

420
00:59:14,745 --> 00:59:27,545
What happens is that they have taken all kinds of information that comes and put them in the repertory.

421
00:59:28,825 --> 00:59:38,785
So we have lost the original programming and the results are not as they should be.

422
00:59:39,575 --> 00:59:45,465
Because of too much input of information, of crazy information as well.

423
00:59:51,865 --> 00:59:58,455
Those who use the RADAR they have to separate and they have the possibility to say

424
00:59:58,704 --> 01:00:04,855
I would like to have repertorization with these authors only.

425
01:00:05,345 --> 01:00:13,025
And you use the old authors. Kent basically and some other authors.

426
01:00:13,546 --> 01:00:15,095
But if you use all the authors,

427
01:00:15,344 --> 01:00:24,074
whoever has inserted information in the repertory it’s not reliable and you are going to get wrong symptoms.
