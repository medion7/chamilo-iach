1
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:36,540
Let's see now these reactions in a more precise manner, taking into consideration the mental-emotional side

2
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,220
the physical side, plus the energy.
What happens?

3
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:55,100
You see Kent's observations were gross observations that he gave as an indication in general

4
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:08,840
and they're quite correct in their general idea.
But let us see more precisely what happens.

5
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:27,030
Here we separate the energy, the mental-emotional and the physical and we have 3 lines.

6
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:53,000
Of course the first reaction, an aggravation on the mental-emotional, energy and then recovery which is quick, is the best reaction.

7
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:07,780
In this case we may see also an aggravation
of the mental-emotional state.

8
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:30,140
An aggravation on the energy level: he feels weak the first days, he has to sleep a lot of hours etc.

9
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:45,560
 An aggravation on the mental-emotional: he says, I was crying for 24h and the pains
were worse,

10
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:51,700
this is very good reaction.

11
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:01,930
And this is the reason why we say, we don't accept the idea of placebo in Homeopathy.

12
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:10,780
When they talk about placebo in Homeopathy and they say, everything is placebo, you tell them,

13
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:19,120
you come and I take your case and I give a remedy and see if you feel better after a while, and then you give him

14
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:24,430
the correct remedy and you cure him but
before he has the aggravation.

15
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:45,500
Let's see now a little bit more complicated case. The patient says, I feel much better, amelioration with little or no aggravation.

16
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:51,500
Better in every respect.

17
00:03:54,210 --> 00:04:06,560
What it means? It means that the case belongs to A group, the uppermost.

18
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:16,580
These are the cases where the pathology is very functional, it's very mild though the suffering may be strong

19
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:29,030
 the pains maybe strong the pathology is minimal. Therefore you don't need to see the initial reaction.

20
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:56,570
Of course in such cases you have a very good prognosis. The person is going to live longer, free of disturbances etc.

21
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:04,210
These are the cases where you treat today and after 20 years you see them again and say, do you remember me?

22
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:11,340
I say, no. I was the one who came 20 years ago and I was suffering so much and you treated me,

23
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:19,080
Very good this is the best case you can have. Come here, I treat you again.

24
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:35,780
Here we have the possibility where the patient says, I feel much better but I still have some symptoms.

25
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:50,480
This is the case where these minor symptoms either will go away by the time, if you wait long enough,

26
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:59,800
or they'll constitute the possibility to find the underlying remedy.

27
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:10,120
In any case these symptoms are not really bothering the patient. He says, I can live with them.

28
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:25,510
In such a case the best tactic is to wait, not to give a remedy for such symptoms. You can wait for 6 months, 1 year.

29
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:42,730
For instance the case we saw yesterday with the headache, if she goes on with mild headaches which can be treated,

30
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:50,360
can be ameliorated by aspirin
we will wait and wait.

31
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:59,430
But if these headaches become worse and worse, we go back to Lac caninum

32
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:20,330
not to Causticum, not to Phosphorus. Phosphorus maybe after 3 years will be indicated, I don't know.

33
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:34,480
This is a case again where he has some
new symptoms that belong to the remedy.

34
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:50,870
If you make a mistake here and you treat these symptoms, these new symptoms that they develop

35
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,050
belong to the remedy you gave.

36
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:05,310
Such a good reaction, initial aggravation, amelioration and then new symptoms and you treat these symptoms,

37
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:12,490
this is the biggest mistake you can make.
Why we have this condition, do you know?

38
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:19,920
Because the organism is very sensitive to the remedy so it may give out some of the

39
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:24,660
characteristic symptoms of the remedy.

40
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:33,880
This person is the best prover for this remedy but with an amelioration it means a cure is going to

41
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:40,850
 take place and the symptoms will vanish,
 don't bother, don't touch them.

42
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:58,620
I think these mistakes were made. You know this book we were writing together with Bill Gray

43
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:13,110
 and he was in Athens staying there for 2 years with me and left his patients behind. When he saw these observations,

44
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:22,260
he withdrew the remedies he was giving all the time. In the end of the year he went back for 1 month

45
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,060
 to see all his patients and see what
happened and then he came back.

46
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:36,470
He said, George you won't believe my success was fantastic this time. All these years I was battling with the cases,

47
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:44,620
now I left them alone and in 1 year most
of the cases were cured, I can't believe it.

48
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:52,800
That's how, he, himself saw the
results of that strategy.

49
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:09,080
You have the aggravation of the physical symptoms and then amelioration of the physical symptoms.

50
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:27,040
But energy and mental-emotional remains the same, unchanged.

51
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:49,060
It means that the remedy was correct as a first remedy but there is another underlying remedy  which you have to find.

52
00:10:53,500 --> 00:11:02,660
 If you wait you will see some physical
 symptoms appearing as well,

53
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,670
 which you have to take into consideration together with the mental-emotional

54
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:15,900
 and see whether you can find the next remedy. In any case you will have to wait

55
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:27,050
 because you may see that after 3-4 months a general amelioration may take place as well.

56
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:44,900
This is the case where mostly happens in the practice. This is what you get really, I'm better but not really well.

57
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:50,260
Better without aggravation,
no change of energy.

58
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:13,390
Now here you have to be careful. If this happens with a pathology which is not severe,

59
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:23,160
if this happens in group 1
that means wrong remedy.

60
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:39,830
If this happens in group lower 3 or 4 this might be the correct remedy but the organism does not have enough

61
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:58,300
energy to recuperate. You get some deep cases in which you prescribe very carefully and there are changes,

62
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:10,510
there are ameliorations without an initial aggravation and this amelioration brings the case more and more

63
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:15,540
to a possibility of a cure.
Eventually when you will give the last remedy,

64
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:25,430
 then you will have a reaction, then you will see deep changes and possibility of a cure.

65
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:35,670
In all these possibilities there are a lot of questions that I don't see you're asking but anyhow it doesn't matter.

66
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:48,280
-Can you repeat it with the groups?

67
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:11,580
-When this reaction happens in group 1 patients when there is no deep pathology

68
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:20,590
it means the remedy is wrong, it's close but wrong definitely.

69
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:33,190
If this happens in group 3 or 4, it might be the remedy is correct, that means the symptoms are ameliorated

70
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:37,440
though the whole patient is not affected.

71
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:46,420
Then you will see later on another remedy, later on another remedy, until you reach a point

72
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:51,730
where you hit deep and then there is a reaction.

73
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:26,220
With the Italian group these lectures took 5 days because they had a lot of questions which I don't see in this group.

74
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:35,120
-You once said that if you take more and more remedies then you're going to be confused on an emotional level

75
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:45,040
and that you're drifting towards an emotional sickness and that no remedy picture is clear anymore.

76
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:58,650
-Not only emotional, it can be physical, changing the symptoms of the physical body can also happen.

77
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:11,960
Not necessarily that you drive the disease in the mental-emotional, you can confuse it also in the physical level.

78
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:19,750
-But where is the point that differentiates this from the provings? Where is the healthy part in this?

79
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:29,270
-She is talking about this case?

80
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:32,650
-No, in general.

81
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:49,640
-The question in general is what is the
 difference between a proving and what?

82
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:56,910
-Making many provings?

83
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:13,710
-Yes, I did not make it clear. The difference is that if you make a proving you develop some symptoms,

84
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:20,060
you wait until the symptoms go away
 and you make the next proving.

85
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:27,300
When you confuse the case you don't wait the symptoms to go away by themselves,

86
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,700
you want to push them out by a remedy,
so you give another remedy.

87
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:36,620
Then there is another remedy and then there is more confusion, more symptoms, different symptoms.

88
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:46,090
Then you give a third remedy, a fourth remedy and therefore making this confusion. This is the difference.

89
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,440
-Does this have a positive effect in the whole?

90
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,420
-Which one, the proving?

91
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,190
-Anyway both because they are similar.

92
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:56,820
-No, they are not similar.

93
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,080
-But you said it has a positive effect to take provings.

94
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:15,140
-If you make a proving correctly, it is positive. If you confuse the case, it means you cannot find finally

95
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:22,590
what is the remedy so the person
will remain in that confused state.

96
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:34,670
Here is the difference between order and disorder. When you have a proving and then you let it go

97
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:47,620
and then you have another proving and you
let it go. Now in this you have this and then on this picture

98
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,370
you impose another remedy
and you make it like this.

99
00:18:52,470 --> 00:19:00,220
And then you impose another picture and you make it like this. This is the final result.

100
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:15,830
You don't know anymore what is the order in the organism. That is why it's very difficult to cure.

101
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:29,750
This happens with specialties. They give mixtures 20-30 remedies where they try to cure, let us say,

102
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:45,260
chronic headaches and you ask the person what is the problem now? Now the problem is I can't think,

103
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,910
there is something which is between
 headache and vertigo.

104
00:19:55,150 --> 00:20:02,170
You try to find the remedy, no picture.
This is what has happened.

105
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:10,770
In the first years when I was treating Krishnamurti and I went to Switzerland and a lot of people

106
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:22,850
were coming to listen to him from France, Belgium, Germany all the countries of Europe,

107
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:32,040
patients that they would come to me to be treated, invariably all those cases that they were treated

108
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:40,850
by the homeopaths they were all polypharmacy. They were all either specialties

109
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:53,780
or mixing 20, 30 remedies and give it. Invariably in such cases I could not find any remedy. It was a confusion

110
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,770
and the confusion was in the mind. My mind is not functioning.

111
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:17,960
Maybe the initial problem or pains they have disappeared but it has become something else which has no order.

112
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:30,880
So that is why all the pharmaceutical
companies wanted to kill me during that time.

113
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:39,600
They said, what are you talking? Instead of giving 30 remedies, we give only 1 and only 1 time?

114
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:50,140
Do you believe that we can exist by selling 1 remedy to this patient and cure this patient with 1 remedy?

115
00:21:53,680 --> 00:22:09,080
And then they started putting doctors to attack me but it's ok, I am a hard indigestible object.

116
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:24,750
Now they have put the church against me and say, he is the high priest of a new religion.

117
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:30,220
I did not know that, maybe, this is ridiculous.

118
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:47,470
-George, in such a case where it is confused in NY I get people who've seen many different types of Homeopaths

119
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:53,180
or people where don't even study Homeopathy, they read a book and they take many, many different remedies

120
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:59,050
and then they come to my office. What do you do? Do you wait and you say, just come back

121
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:02,510
in 6 months and see if your picture is clear?

122
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:12,980
-I tell you what is the best policy. First of all you explain to them that you have to have time, to give you time.

123
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:20,230
The second is to study very well the case and find what is the best indicated remedy.

124
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:32,460
Once you give it then you wait, and wait and watch until you see a picture of a remedy coming more clear

125
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:42,050
 and then you can give the second remedy. In this way eventually you may take them out of the confusion.

126
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:54,100
This is a very bad state for us, it's not so bad to have side effects from allopathic drugs as much as when they have taken

127
00:23:54,200 --> 00:24:06,890
20-30 remedies before and they come to us to be treated. This is more difficult because this order has been disturbed.

128
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:16,250
The chemical drugs do not disturb the order.

129
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:35,630
Cortisone disturbs the order which is taken every day, there is no question and psychotropic drugs disturb the order.

130
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:49,230
But for someone to take for a period of time antibiotics or to take pain killers it's not so bad

131
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,320
 but for someone all the time to take wrong homeopathic remedies...

132
00:24:55,420 --> 00:25:02,290
Because here in the 20-30 remedies maybe he takes the correct one also but the person not knowing

133
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:11,160
 how to evaluate he does not know that he gave the right remedy and continues to give other remedies.

134
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,410
This is the tragic.

135
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:33,860
-I have a question to the picture 6 and I think we just go too fast so I can't pose any questions and it's so interesting.

136
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:41,500
What you said before is that in group 1 is the wrong remedy but in group 1 when the health

137
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:50,290
is so strong and the organism is so strong,
 how can wrong remedy suppress ?

138
00:25:51,800 --> 00:26:16,820
-Not suppress, ameliorate. I don't say suppress. He is better on the physical symptom, it's not suppression

139
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:42,080
but I have other symptoms like some anxiety etc. and my energy is low, it's not improved. But my chronic cough is better.

140
00:26:43,360 --> 00:27:02,060
In such a case if this is on the first level, that means strong personality, the remedy touches only upon the physical symptoms.

141
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:17,060
What they used to do in old times, they knew some keynotes and they used these keynotes and gave the remedy

142
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:27,440
according to the keynotes only. And this was the result. Better the symptom without the patient getting better.

143
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:42,720
The correct reaction on the first group should be either aggravation and then amelioration or a general amelioration.

144
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:52,900
That is the correct reaction. If you see this reaction you know that your remedy has acted partially,

145
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,010
only upon a portion of the patient.

146
00:27:56,110 --> 00:28:10,540
But as you go down the scale, this reaction may mean, if you go down to the groups, may mean that the organism is not

147
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:23,540
possible to do any better. It does this and then you have to search for the underlying remedy.

148
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:36,630
-Concerning patients in group 3 and 4. If the emotional and mental sphere is getting worse, how long can I wait?

149
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:45,740
You said, the physical is getting better but the mental-emotional is getting worse, this scares me to be in my office

150
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:51,520
and watch people getting worse in mental-emotional, how long can I wait?

151
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:55,910
-For which observation she is talking, which number?

152
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:08,650
Number 6 doesn't say that the mental-
emotional is getting worse, it's the same.

153
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:25,580
If he gets worse, that's another observation. I'm better but not really well, she complains she's better

154
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:33,940
without aggravation no change in energy
or mental-emotional.

155
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:44,950
This observation does not say that the
mental-emotional becomes worse.

156
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:33,340
- One example is somebody coming in my office, he has inflammation of the skin and some others which is a Belladona picture.

157
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:46,380
I give Belladona, the inflammation disappears. I have no time asking about other things. Later on he comes,

158
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:55,200
and he says the inflammation is away but now I feel emotionally or my energy worse than before.

159
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:07,530
If I had asked about other things I would find another remedy which is better fit?

160
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:22,050
-Better yes but that is different from this observation. This says that the physical symptoms are better,

161
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:27,230
and we're talking about chronic conditions.

162
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:33,400
The physical symptoms are better but the mental-emotional energy no change.

163
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:48,340
That means your lumbago is better but mental-emotional is the same. If it is worse is another observation.

164
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:59,720
If it becomes worse the mental-emotional
and the energy then it's another observation.
 We see it later on.

165
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:11,110
-But this inflammation could be a
sign of an underlying chronic disease.

166
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:24,580
-Maybe, that's possible but if there is aggravation on the mental-emotional while the physical is better,

167
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:34,380
this is not this observation. This observation we say, no change on mental-emotional or energy.

168
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:44,220
-But in this case I said, would you
say then that it was a suppression?

169
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,020
-Yes.

170
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:55,820
-I would like to know how long I would
have to wait when such a disorder the

171
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:03,670
way you painted it on the blackboard has appeared? Because this is a very common case in practice.

172
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:10,350
In this way you can start retaking the case from
a month later.

173
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:20,920
If you don't see another remedy, then you wait. You give placebo you come later on, then you find out eventually

174
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:33,740
you have the right picture. The basic idea is don't rush to give a remedy when you are unsure in such a case.

175
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:45,170
Don't rush. Or I made a mistake,
I'll give you another remedy, no wait.

176
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:03,780
-George can I ask one more question about the previous graph? If the two parts of the graph were

177
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:08,740
the other way around that the mental-emotional had improved and the physical symptoms

178
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:14,780
had remained the same, am
I right thinking that wait...

179
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,260
-Then you have to wait.

180
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:21,800
-For the physical symptoms to start
 to remove at some later stage?

181
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:25,640
-Yes correct.

182
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:34,390
-I have a case, the patient comes with a complaint, I give him a remedy, the physical gets better

183
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:41,940
and then soon he comes back half a year later and has a relapse. And then if I give him the correct remedy

184
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:49,280
 I have an amelioration in all three levels.
Is that what you mean with this graph?

185
00:34:49,380 --> 00:35:01,620
-Yes, if you give another remedy and has an amelioration of 3 levels, then it is the correct remedy.

186
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:19,060
But this cannot happen in group 3 downwards. Next time he comes or 3rd time he comes that you find a remedy

187
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:25,010
 that will ameliorate all the situation, mental-emotional, energy and the symptoms.

188
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:36,340
In these lower groups you will not see that. In the upper groups it means it should be reacting like this, is not reacting

189
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:42,550
is reacting only partially, that means your remedy is acting partially, therefore you have to search

190
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:58,800
for another remedy which is deeper. You will see this situation, you have a bronchitis and the person calls you,

191
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:10,590
the first night I haven't slept the whole night
I have been coughing, coughing with sputum.

192
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:22,310
And you say, was it difficult to lie down? Yes,
I had to get up, lying down was very difficult for me.

193
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:43,500
So you think quickly, Coccus cacti, take 200, 3 doses. He goes through the night and he says, the cough was

194
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:54,250
not so bad I still cough quite a lot, the fever was higher, the sputum does not come out so much so

195
00:36:54,350 --> 00:37:03,040
it's rather dry but the cough in general was better.

196
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:07,900
What is your assumption?

197
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:21,940
Partial action of the remedy. Then my head was very hot and my feet were cold and you say,

198
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:31,420
my God this was a case of Belladona not a case of Coccus cacti. You give Belladona

199
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:37,880
and you have initial reaction and then he feels better.

200
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:49,350
This is applicable to a small scale like in a severe acute or to a larger scale where you're treating chronic conditions.

201
00:37:50,860 --> 00:38:11,630
Now if you treat an acute condition upon a patient who is sick chronically, that's a different story.

202
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:23,620
Because if you take the acute condition as a physical symptomatology and you give a remedy and you treat this,

203
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:35,010
 you may give the correct remedy, the condition goes away and the underlying chronic condition stays.

204
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:49,080
In that case the remedy is correct. Why?

205
00:38:49,930 --> 00:39:07,620
Because during the acute, he has physical symptoms but at the same time he feels tired

206
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:20,820
and at the same time he says, I feel lazy.
Do you have energy? No, I'm lazy.

207
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:32,670
 So in the acute you have the effect upon the mental-emotional, the energy and the physical.

208
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:48,000
When you give Coccus cacti, you ameliorate the cough but these two remain the same,

209
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:57,410
that means partial action of the remedy. When you give the correct remedy, all this has to come down.

210
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:13,300
The underlying chronic condition will be untouched; still the remedy is correct because there was

211
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:19,360
no connection between his
acute and his chronic condition.

212
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:31,180
If there was a connection, if the remedy fitted his chronic condition as well, you will see a big reaction

213
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:40,680
and when he comes out of the acute condition, he says, I feel much better, my heart is better,

214
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:48,620
my liver is better, my stomach is better.

215
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:19,720
My original problem is better but now I have another one. Better without aggravation while deeper problem has emerged...

216
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:43,840
You see whenever you do not see aggravations, you have a big problem actually. You like to see the initial aggravation.

217
00:41:49,050 --> 00:42:06,460
This is the case in which you suppress and you have the appearance of a new condition which is deeper.

218
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:23,700
You treat for instance arthritis of the joints of the fingers. You give Caulophyllum because it has pains in the finger joints

219
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:36,280
and the pains go away but after two months the pains appear in the wrist or in the elbow.

220
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:49,340
This you know that it is a suppressive effect, the patient does not know because he feels he is treated well

221
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:59,680
but now it's a new condition, the pain in the elbow, but you know what you have done.

222
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:06,360
It doesn't matter if the patient knows or he understands.

223
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:22,520
 But the same time in such a case you do not see any change in general condition of the patient.

224
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:31,980
Or you treat psoriasis which is in the palms or the hands and then psoriasis appears on the face.

225
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:38,210
 You know that, I've done it.

226
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:48,770
What do you have to do?
How you handle this case?

227
00:43:52,000 --> 00:44:02,860
Don't be in panic and start throwing remedies and start antidote. Don't worry because if the organism

228
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:13,820
is strong enough will by itself return to the original state. So if you don't know what to do, you give placebo

229
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,020
and the original state will come back.

230
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:38,930
 But if you want to do something then you retake the case and you may find out that they were symptoms

231
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:44,140
 that were there in the case but the patient did not mention in the first place

232
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:51,840
 or symptoms that you did not take into consideration.

233
00:44:53,260 --> 00:45:03,940
And if you take now these symptoms, the remedy picture becomes more clear. Many times we think that

234
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:13,220
we know the remedy and by the end of the consultation there is one or two symptoms added and you change the prescription.

235
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:18,900
This is the case where you would have given the wrong remedy which would be close, would have

236
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:30,510
this effect without the last moment information.
 It changes the whole picture.

237
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:40,260
And then if you are lucky this will happen in time, otherwise it will happen in the next consultation,

238
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:44,800
or the third or the fifth consultation, I don't know.

239
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:55,900
-I have a question to case 7, the one before.
If you have given the wrong remedy and in the next consultation

240
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:04,240
you see a new remedy, also through the new symptoms that appeared, when is the correct time to give this new remedy?

241
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:18,860
-If you see a new remedy picture after this, that is the next observation where it means that you did not have

242
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:25,620
originally enough information to prescribe
 but you prescribed close enough.

243
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:37,800
The organism then gives out new symptoms which then have a clear picture of the new remedy.

244
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:49,860
That is what we call the one-sided diseases where they don't give enough information to prescribe,

245
00:46:49,960 --> 00:47:00,220
you prescribe and there are some changes but there are new symptoms even worse than before.

246
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:17,100
The person may feel even worse after your remedy and this worse will stay for years if you don't treat

247
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:30,370
but this new picture is clear that means your first remedy though it seemed that brought about an aggravation

248
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:33,870
and new symptoms, it's a correct remedy.

249
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:45,120
Which gave you a new picture now which is more clear, you prescribe and you have a beautiful cure.

250
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:55,380
-A question on 7 again please. A new symptom that comes up on 7, do I take that into

251
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:59,760
consideration when I'm relooking at the case?

252
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:11,830
-The new symptoms which they have appeared after the original, have gone.

253
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:26,890
You may take it into consideration.
You may have to ignore it.

254
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:30,990
-How do I know?

255
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:44,140
-There is a rule. If these new symptoms make the case more clear, you take them in consideration.

256
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:53,130
If on the contrary these new symptoms do not fit your remedy picture which you already have, ignore them.

257
00:48:54,860 --> 00:49:00,560
-If I understand correctly that in case 7 there are two possibilities of interpretation.

258
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:07,030
The main interpretation was that the remedy was incorrect and acted in a suppressive manner,

259
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:11,190
in some cases this could have been the remedy

260
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:17,480
 that was correct which opened the case through producing new symptoms and cleared it.

261
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:28,810
-We did not put this in the same. What you say is in the next observation, where it makes the picture clear.

262
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:39,490
New symptoms but with the new symptoms you have a more clear picture. The remedy was good.

263
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:51,360
-I have a question concerning special case. A case where we were circling Natrum muriaticum for a long time

264
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:58,340
and then a picture of Ignatia became clear. How do I differentiate the following?

265
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:05,990
After taking Ignatia she had an amelioration which lasted for a couple of hours and afterwards she fell into

266
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:17,730
deep sleep going on for days, extreme tiredness and then she came into a state which seems to be Natrum muriaticum.

267
00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:31,250
I think it is an aggravation on mental-emotional level, she is closed to herself. Now the question is:

268
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:41,340
was this the wrong remedy, was it a proving
or was it indication for the next remedy?

269
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:45,400
And is it possible that there are some
people who react so quickly

270
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:51,560
to a remedy and produce a new remedy
 picture within short amount of time?

271
00:50:53,300 --> 00:51:05,260
-The reaction which she describes, which she had an amelioration and then she fell into a deep sleep.

272
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:26,140
This is a very good reaction. This we consider an aggravation on the energy level. So it goes to the first reaction

273
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:31,140
where we had aggravation on all
levels and then amelioration.

274
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:43,160
So she had to wait without any other remedy, so after Ignatia eventually she would be better and better.

275
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:57,740
In any case she would be better, she may need after a month Natrum muriaticum to complete the action but definitely

276
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:10,450
that kind of reaction where the person falls asleep for 20-30 hours after the remedy, is a very good reaction

277
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:22,820
and points to the fact that the patient is going to be well if you wait long enough to see it.

278
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:37,760
The problem is that even in the older times when they gave a lot of mixtures, many times they had cures.

279
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:47,910
But these cures brought out some reactions. Now that was the time when everybody was spoiling the case

280
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:52,650
and bringing back everything good
 that was done even with the mixtures.

281
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:58,820
You have Calcarea carbonica in the mixture, the person is Calcarea carbonica, then you have a reaction,

282
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:01,310
and then they break out with an eruption.

283
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:09,890
And then as soon they see the eruption they say, oh my god Sulphur, Rhus tox until you suppress,

284
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:13,210
back again the whole situation.

285
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:24,660
This is not Homeopathy, this is not understood the basics of Homeopathy.

286
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:37,540
If you know this theory I'm absolutely sure that you can predict a lot of things that happen in your patient.

287
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:49,380
And then you are not afraid. You see the fears coming and you say, don't worry they'll go away.

288
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:58,760
Now I have this, now I have a depression. Don't worry, but you know when you say it. You don't say, don't worry

289
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:08,880
to anybody who comes. You know when to say don't worry and when to worry.

290
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:15,670
If you know the theory you know what's going to happen.

291
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:26,640
-In the observation 8 if you see some new and more severe pathology compared with the original one,

292
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:32,850
was this patient anyway going to go to this pathology or is due to the remedy?

293
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:43,480
-He was going to go but you speed up the process. There is no pathology that will develop to a patient because of the remedy.

294
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:53,060
It is because is the course of the disease and he was going to get to that state, 3 months later or 1 year later.

295
00:54:53,160 --> 00:55:03,760
Then you give the remedy and the organism accepts the furthering of the development of the disease but

296
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:09,780
we cannot say that with Homeopathy
 we give a disease, no.

297
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:15,760
It is only when there is possibility in the organism, then this possibility will develop.

298
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:28,640
-You mentioned new symptoms. Are these, symptoms that have never before been presented

299
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:34,780
in that case or are they symptoms that the patient revealed...

300
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:45,150
-Yes, never before presented to the case. New symptoms, I give you the example. You have the psoriasis

301
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:52,260
 in the legs and then you see it in the face. Did you have it in the face before? No.

302
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:55,750
Now it's the first time you have it?
 Yes. That's a suppression.

303
00:55:55,850 --> 00:56:10,260
If he had it before and it was taken away by cortisone etc. and then reappears in the face, that is different.

304
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:13,550
-But if it starts in the face and moves down to the hands ...

305
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,760
-It's a very good reaction.

306
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:33,810
-I have a question about suppression. I have a case with arthritis in the fingers and then happened exactly what you said.

307
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:41,450
But this arthritis in the fingers lasted for several weeks. Then it went away with Tuberculinum.

308
00:56:41,550 --> 00:56:52,620
Several months later was an inflammation of the elbow but this went away very fast, only 2-3 days.

309
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:55,230
-By what remedy?

310
00:56:55,330 --> 00:57:05,120
-Again by Tuberculinum. Now was this suppression or was a cure?

311
00:57:05,850 --> 00:57:11,520
The second of inflammation was for the patient much easier to stand.

312
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:33,590
-It was a cure. Why? You remember yesterday I put the 3 cones and I said it will depend on the intensity.

313
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:48,200
We have depression here and we have depression here, it's a different kind of depression.

314
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:58,660
A depression here will be treated with 5 remedies for 5 years or 10 remedies for 5 years

315
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:04,750
and this depression here will be treated
with 1 remedy in 2 days.

316
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:27,040
So if you treat a condition which is here with arthritis or is here severe arthritis of the fingers and it goes well.

317
00:58:29,050 --> 00:58:44,180
Then you have a milder form of arthritis on a place which supposed to be deeper but the arthritis is milder,

318
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:57,110
it's on this level now. It's deeper but immediately went away, so the person develops arthritis here

319
00:58:57,210 --> 00:59:01,360
 but he comes into that level
and develops arthritis.

320
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:16,630
  All these things were not known before, I'm treating depression

321
00:59:16,730 --> 00:59:21,570
 I'm depressed, I took the remedy and I'm depressed, I took the remedy and I have fears,

322
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:26,310
  I took the remedy and this and that, total confusion.

323
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:35,180
Now we're trying to clarify this confusion and to know what we're doing and why we're doing something.

324
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:47,580
-A patient from a different country which I only see every 4 months, and she had severe asthma,

325
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:53,090
  had a remedy 4 months ago and then it
changed into very bad eczema on the hands.

326
00:59:53,190 --> 01:00:04,140
This person is a singer and school teacher for rock music and she keeps calling what can I do for her hands

327
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:12,090
because without cortisone cream she can't do anything. So what I give her Silica or something else?

328
01:00:12,190 --> 01:00:16,620
I'm really mixed up. I'd really love to give her Graph or something else but I know I shouldn't.

329
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:20,860
-What is the original remedy you gave?

330
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:24,890
-I think it was Sulphur.

331
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:35,140
-If the itching is Sulphur again, it's
worse at night, worse with water...

332
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:42,060
-It has blisters and she said it's opening,
I haven't seen it yet.

333
01:00:43,150 --> 01:00:55,200
-Maybe it's still on Sulphur level and by giving a higher potency of Sulphur it may help her as well.

334
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:13,130
It is necessary to see her. If you treat asthma and immediately you have the reappearance, this is a very fortunate thing.

335
01:01:13,230 --> 01:01:21,100
That means the remedy was correct, the organism is strong, she could be saved this person

336
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:29,100
but you have to be careful not to drive it back because with the wrong medication you will drive it back.

337
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:39,760
-What can I do because she is playing guitar and she can't do this because she has audience and concerts.

338
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:49,600
She should wear gloves and
have a little cream on it.

339
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:08,280
-This is a practical problem, you have to ask her but theoretically I tell you what you have to do.

340
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:15,910
You have to see the case whether she is still Sulphur or maybe another remedy and then you give it

341
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:30,010
but even in such a case I would say, wait and see whether the original Sulphur would clear up the eruption as well.

342
01:02:33,270 --> 01:02:39,620
-I saw children that were treated in their childhood when they were 2 years old for neurodermatitis

343
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:58,500
and after about 2 years, they return and showed signs of spastic bronchitis. How should I evaluate this?

344
01:02:58,600 --> 01:03:05,080
Does this have to do with wrong homeopathic treatment or do they just come years later with a new disease?

345
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:24,170
-No, this has to do with wrong homeopathic treatment unless the eczema was very bad and the asthma was very light.

346
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:33,970
Unless you have this difference and then in such a case if, let us say, you have given Calcarea carbonica

347
01:03:34,070 --> 01:03:40,690
2 years ago and now you will see again Calcarea carbonica picture, you will give it for the asthma and the asthma

348
01:03:40,790 --> 01:03:49,110
will go away beautifully and maybe will
 reappear some eczema but mild.

349
01:03:49,880 --> 01:04:03,410
But if you have given a lot of remedies to cure this and now the asthma is really bad, that is wrong treatment.

350
01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:11,970
- You say that the difference between 7 and 8 is that the appearing of the new symptoms is on the one hand going

351
01:04:12,070 --> 01:04:28,600
on the opposite direction of the law of Hering where in 8 the new symptoms appear

352
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:34,320
independently from the law of Hering.

353
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:42,960
-That is true. When we have the opposite of the law of Herrring we suspect a suppression.

354
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:54,100
But even then, if the new symptoms present a clear picture then still the remedy,

355
01:04:54,200 --> 01:05:01,580
I would say is correct and you give it and
then you see the final cure.

356
01:05:02,330 --> 01:05:15,200
But usually when you have the opposite of the law of cure, then you have a suppression and the remedy is incorrect.

357
01:05:43,860 --> 01:05:54,450
Going opposite to the law of cure, usually is wrong unless there is a new picture which is clear.

358
01:05:54,550 --> 01:06:07,550
You see even a case of asthma in which you give a remedy and then you produce symptoms on the mental level

359
01:06:07,650 --> 01:06:22,740
which are Sulphur symptoms. I become lazy,
I don't want to work, I don't want to wash, this we consider

360
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:33,200
the remedy was correct because it produced a clear picture of Sulphur on the mental-emotional and physical level.
