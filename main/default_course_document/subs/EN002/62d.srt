1
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,670
-So the next stage we go into blockages on emotional level.

2
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,980
Here we have, as a first group, we have a group of symptoms

3
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:49,170
which I call I've given a name to that group, it's not known to allopathic Medicine

4
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:56,230
but I believe it may become a group of sick people in Psychiatry,

5
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:01,620
I call them "the husband syndrome".

6
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:11,490
Usually these patients are women. I've not seen yet a man with the situation

7
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:17,330
I'm going to relate to you, the husband syndrome. What is that syndrome? What happens?

8
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:25,830
Can you tell me? Every woman I see here, they say, I know.

9
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,590
The husband is responsible, not me!

10
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:46,250
The husband syndrome when a woman has married a man not because she loves him

11
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:59,350
but because she feels with him a kind of security.

12
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:10,100
The woman feels he is a good husband, not a boyfriend, he is a good husband.

13
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:15,540
She calculates the pros and cons and she says I don't feel attracted

14
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,440
but I think he's a good case.

15
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,790
I must not lose that case.

16
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:53,430
These thoughts are kind of breaking ... the laws of nature, a woman is attracted to a man

17
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:59,690
and a man is attracted to a woman. The man does not have the possibility to pretend

18
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:10,190
that he likes the woman, for physical reasons, on sexual relationship the man can not pretend;

19
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:19,660
either he likes a woman, he wants to have sexual intercourse with a woman or he doesn't.

20
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,910
He can not do otherwise.

21
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,920
I do not like that woman but still I can have sexual intercourse with her.

22
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:33,770
He is impotent. The woman is not in that condition. The woman can pretend.

23
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:42,270
Therefore they're thinking OK, sex is not a big deal with me, I can pretend.

24
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:51,450
You can pretend in sex but in a woman that functions are natural still,

25
00:03:51,550 --> 00:04:00,800
that means she will need the outlet of the sexual climax and she does not have that,

26
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:06,710
she will not have that, she will not have an orgasm because she is not excited,

27
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:10,550
she is not chemically attracted to this husband.

28
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,750
What happens to such a woman?

29
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:23,450
There is no outlet and at the same time this woman must be a kind of moralist;

30
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:29,290
that means a woman who says I can not go with another man.

31
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:42,200
So she does not have the outlet of an extramarital affair outside of her marriage

32
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:50,040
she does not have the possibility to have that and that builds a pressure in her

33
00:04:50,140 --> 00:05:00,450
eventually so big that what she does is, she develops a kind of symptomatology

34
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,700
which is not typical.

35
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,540
I can not tell you now this is the symptomatology, when you see it, that's the husband syndrome,

36
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:14,390
you be careful. I can not tell you that and I will tell you why.

37
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,030
You treat these cases because they come with chronic headaches.

38
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:23,280
You say, since when? Since 10 years.

39
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:33,700
And you give the right remedy and then she comes after 2-3 months, maybe I'm better in that,

40
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:39,540
not even saying I'm better but she will not mention anymore the headaches

41
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:47,040
but what now is important is the heart, the palpitation and I feel dyspnea

42
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,370
and everything is in the heart. What about the headaches?

43
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:55,860
Yes the headaches are there but these aches are now. Are they so strong as they used to be?

44
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:01,120
Not so strong but this is now, the dyspnea.

45
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,190
And you say, what have I done here? Have I given a close remedy, have I given the wrong remedy,

46
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:12,030
the right remedy and then you search for another remedy and you prescribe in such a case

47
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:18,640
and what happens after a few months she comes back with another set of symptoms.

48
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:26,530
Every time there is another set of symptoms almost, why?

49
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:32,790
Because she must be sick, why? Because she must have an excuse

50
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:36,140
not to have sex with her husband.

51
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:45,630
That is the only way she can get away from a situation which is very adverse to her.

52
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:52,200
So she will say today I have a headache and she makes a whole scene.

53
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,880
She is so sick and the husband says, forget it.

54
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,020
How do you recognize such cases? You can not recognize them from the beginning

55
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,020
as I said. You will recognize them after you fail again and again

56
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,270
and after you've seen the symptomatology changing all the time,

57
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,860
from one symptomatology to the other.

58
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:27,200
This situation you may discuss it with your patient and she will tell you eventually.

59
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:33,350
You put a direct question. I remember a case when I was called to treat a case

60
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:37,340
of that type at 12 o'clock in the night.

61
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:45,580
And we went together with a psychiatrist, we went together to see the case.

62
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:55,560
Vomiting all the time, we arrived at 1 o'clock in the house.

63
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:02,490
She was vomiting, exhausted completely and she was hospitalized.

64
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:08,890
She was completely exhausted from vomiting, dehydrated, the heart was very weak

65
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:16,230
she was almost collapsing, no blood pressure, very weak in general, a frightening situation,

66
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,320
not knowing what to do.

67
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:27,630
And I gave, I don't remember the remedies, I gave one remedy, Ipecacuanha,

68
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:32,700
I don't remember what it was, nothing and then another remedy, nothing and then another one

69
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,820
nothing and we were there, it was about 3 o'clock in the morning.

70
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:46,040
But knowing more or less the situation and how she felt about her husband,

71
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,050
intuitively I had an idea.

72
00:08:55,220 --> 00:09:05,290
She was not married yet. She found a husband, he was very good

73
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:08,540
and she was developing these symptoms.

74
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:18,620
But when she had this severe symptomatology she was going to be married,

75
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,730
they were going to be married, they were engaged for 3-4 years.

76
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:30,880
Then when this reaction happened what I thought was that most probably

77
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:38,870
she had fixed the date of marriage and that was final and she could not go back.

78
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:45,630
So I asked this lady, did you fix the date of your marriage?

79
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:52,230
She looked at me and said yes, I said, within a month? She said, yes.

80
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:58,630
I said, do you understand now why you have this reaction?

81
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:13,670
She said, yes I understand. Her mother was there, I said bring her a soup,

82
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:16,020
it was 4 o'clock in the morning.

83
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,030
In a quarter of an hour she was eating the soup.

84
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:33,780
Now you will say that in such cases that you need psychotherapy.

85
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:42,770
Or you need to give an advice which is very simple. What is the advice?

86
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:58,410
Do you think these people will take the advice? That's why I call it the husband syndrome.

87
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:04,400
They will not take your advice. They will say, yes I don't like him but he is so good,

88
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:09,670
he has this quality and that quality, they will try to argue with you.

89
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:14,250
There is no way you will persuade them to leave the husband.

90
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:25,260
Now this is the husband syndrome when I have sent cases to psychiatrist.

91
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:32,160
After I've discussed a little bit with the case I said, well I think

92
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:40,260
that that's what you have to do perhaps, find somebody else, divorce etc. What can you do?

93
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:52,750
And then producing symptoms, I've seen these cases going into fainting and anxiety

94
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:59,650
that are unspoken. They will feel dying. They would call me and say, come I'm dying.

95
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:03,910
The husband would call in the night, she is dying.

96
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:09,020
And I have the woman calling, bring the ambulance.

97
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:20,160
One day is this, the next day is that. I have sent these cases to psychiatrist.

98
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:29,750
The psychiatrist immediately sees the situation without me telling him, be careful

99
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:36,590
and within 3-4 sessions he will say, OK you have to divorce.

100
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,850
They will leave, not the husband, the psychiatrist.

101
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:56,710
That is what I call the husband syndrome. It's very difficult to treat,

102
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:05,570
I have treated such cases, 4-5 cases, with my students we have seen several cases,

103
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:09,380
and we have not been able to break through these cases.

104
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:16,980
To break through and to make a resolution of what is, no homeopathic remedy

105
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:25,960
will not bring about the cure of such a case.

106
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:30,140
On the other hand of course you give some Staphysagria to a woman

107
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:37,240
who is married you expect 40 % of the cases, she will get a divorce.

108
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:43,140
Why? Because Staphysagria is a type that is easily suppressed.

109
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:51,890
So she has been very suppressed all these years, she cannot speak back, the moment

110
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:55,220
that she takes Staphysagria the organism becomes strong,

111
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,550
then the husband gets in the house and says, give me this and she says,

112
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:02,310
wait a moment do you shout?

113
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:11,660
You are talking very bad to me and there is a fight. One fight, two fights, ten fights

114
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,880
and then eventually if Staphysagria keeps on acting,

115
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,300
because there maybe a relapse on the Staphysagria

116
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,640
and goes back to the suppressed state but if she keeps on acting,

117
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:29,490
you may see many times a divorce under Staphysagria.

118
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:36,120
And when we give Staphysagria in a woman that has been suffering with suppression

119
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:42,540
from the husband, we always have that possibility and you have to know that.

120
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,790
That once the organism is acting now in a natural way,

121
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:52,390
the reaction is going to be natural not unnatural that was there, not talking, shut up.

122
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:59,800
She can not shut up anymore. She will speak out. So advice.

123
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,970
Don't give Staphysagria to your wives.

124
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,810
If you want to keep them of course.

125
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:56,540
The second group that we have are deep, emotional insecurities

126
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:04,140
that establish a new way of life. I will give you an example.

127
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:16,890
The previous cases, as I said is only women.

128
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:24,640
I have seen at least such group of people I have not seen men and you understand why.

129
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,140
It belongs to the woman's liberation.

130
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:44,540
Deep emotional insecurity is like a man or a woman may find themselves looking in the mirror

131
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:53,780
when they are still quite young by the moment of the first sexual instinct comes up.

132
00:16:53,880 --> 00:17:01,890
They look and they find themselves not as attractive, very ugly, unattractive.

133
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:08,990
That shock gives a deep emotional insecurity, which is there every time.

134
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:17,100
They see it in the mirror. That insecurity establishes for them a new way of life.

135
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:30,250
What do I mean by that? In order to replace the happiness or the joy

136
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:39,320
that is given through relationship, they find other ways to replace that which are unnatural.

137
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:56,050
It can be different ways. We can have all kinds of deviations but if you see these patients

138
00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:05,810
if you catch them very young you may be able to reestablish order with them.

139
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:18,730
But if that is left 30 years, 35, 40 there is a state of mind that it can not be changed

140
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:30,240
and they have a particular way of life that will never allow the organism to function naturally.

141
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:46,730
That's why I said, it is frustration on the self-preservation level and frustration

142
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:49,980
in the sexual level.

143
00:18:50,080 --> 00:19:00,230
This is a frustration on the sexual sphere because you have an appetite and you have to eat.

144
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,720
This is a natural desire that you have.

145
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:07,730
If you say to your body, I'm not going to give you food, you're going to be sick.

146
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:11,230
Everybody knows that. But with the sex is not as simple as that.

147
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:20,220
Though the desire is equally strong and equally natural, you may say for that desire

148
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,830
forget it I don't want to give you food.

149
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:33,890
As a result you will have some disturbances on that level, especially when

150
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:46,980
and if the outlets which are seeked out, are not in the natural order of things.

151
00:19:50,970 --> 00:20:00,220
You may have some possibilities, some cases where another turn of mind will come

152
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:09,210
when the person really does not lose touch with the reality and his deeper reality

153
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:16,870
which is a deeper communion with higher states of consciousness comes and you may have,

154
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:23,630
because of the sublimation of sexual desire, you may have a mind

155
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:28,920
which works on another level of consciousness.

156
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:39,630
We have then the enlightenment mind, the super-conscious mind functioning.

157
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:49,620
That can be a natural replacement on a deep sexual instinct but it does not come easily

158
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,620
it's not a state that you can find easily.

159
00:20:52,720 --> 00:21:08,620
What you will find is a religious minded people, very narrow, which they will say,

160
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,550
only from here to there; once they put these barriers, from here to there,

161
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:18,370
there is a natural function of the body which does not function anymore naturally

162
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:26,390
and you're going to have problems that you may not be able to solve with homeopathic remedy.

163
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:33,200
You may not be able to break through and get this person away from these ideas,

164
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:39,940
these narrow ideas that he's putting himself into because of emotional insecurity.

165
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:44,890
Because he's ugly or because of other emotional insecurities.

166
00:21:53,710 --> 00:22:00,530
These are people that you may see them having ticks and people

167
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:08,630
that they have a level of depression that you can not reach ever.

168
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:16,610
They have spasms, very difficult to break through these cases.

169
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:25,610
Now you will be treating these people and what is going to happen is that,

170
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:36,440
here in this level, these are their kind of chronic condition

171
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:50,960
that you will not be able to touch with a remedy but once they develop some acute condition,

172
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:58,780
now this level you're going to treat but always she will turn back to that level.

173
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:08,850
So acute diseases that will manifest grieves, a grief for that person

174
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:12,290
may take the picture of Ignatia.

175
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:18,860
You give Ignatia and it takes away the sighing, the extra grief but underneath

176
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:24,780
there is that kind of depression which is there, you can not touch, you can not reach.

177
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:32,520
It leaves a deeper disorder mostly on central, peripheral nervous system,

178
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,630
that you can not touch.

179
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:04,750
Another group is people that are living under a state of permanent calamity,

180
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:19,660
which is they a retarded child, they have deep economic depression constantly,

181
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,740
they are very poor.

182
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:38,730
These people are very difficult to really make the jump and to give them

183
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:45,910
the joy of another level, of what we call in Homeopathy, a jump in level of health.

184
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:54,900
Now such people are of quite sensitive character, because not everybody

185
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,390
who has a retarded child is in that state, only very few parents

186
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:04,750
will go into permanent depression because of that situation.

187
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:15,570
Now in such cases you may have some successes, especially after helping them

188
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:22,570
in a round way, I mean finding them a job or advising them to have another child

189
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:26,170
and have the joy from the other child etc.

190
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:46,560
Another group that you will find very interesting is a group of people

191
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:52,420
that have a habit which they consider a sin.

192
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:15,670
Which is for instance homosexuality, drug addiction, alcoholism, masturbation.

193
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:35,080
What do we see in such cases? When we treat such cases we see the result

194
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:37,360
of the homeopathic remedy.

195
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:49,250
It really makes them feel very well, they enjoy the relationship but back in their mind the sin,

196
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:52,550
the sin, I'm not doing the right thing.

197
00:26:55,010 --> 00:27:02,290
That is going to catch them and eventually bring about a relapse.

198
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:12,260
So what we see in such cases are that remedies are acting but the relapses are easy.

199
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:21,160
Because of the pressure on the emotional, spiritual level.

200
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:30,260
The pressure is too much for the individual and overturns his balance.

201
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:10,900
The sixth group is emotionally dead persons that have suffered tremendously through life

202
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:22,590
and come to the conclusion that finally there is no love, there is no friendship no companionship.

203
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:30,080
They become very closed, to themselves and remote from the society.

204
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:40,740
The loners, the people who have suffered a lot, the sensitive people, the people

205
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:53,070
that have been mistreated in life, the people that have been rejected and if you get them

206
00:28:53,170 --> 00:29:00,820
at the age up to the 30s you may be able to break through that situation.

207
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:15,400
After that age again this belief that in life there is no love, no affection,

208
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:25,170
no companionship all this belief brings about to themselves a state of illness

209
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:32,760
that you will be reaching with great difficulty in breaking through.

210
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:07,650
These cases will make you suffer very much because you see the suffering,

211
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:21,130
almost a living suffering, in front of you and much will depend in such cases

212
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:31,140
on the real affection that you may be able to feel for such cases.

213
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:39,850
What they need most of all is somebody to understand them.

214
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:46,580
You see, we homeopaths, we have been accused many times that

215
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:51,410
what we're doing is just showing some sympathy to the patients and get better.

216
00:30:55,420 --> 00:31:01,070
I say, only the homeopaths can show sympathy?

217
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:09,320
Everybody can show sympathy but there is no effect. Never mind you show as much sympathy

218
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:12,070
as you like to certain

219
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:18,820
individuals, they like it, everybody will like it but not everybody will get better

220
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,610
because of that.

221
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:28,570
Now this group of people is a special group that if you want to have an effect on them really,

222
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:35,660
you have to reestablish their belief in life. The suffering of life has taken away

223
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:41,160
every possible belief that something good may be felt.

224
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:49,820
So by your contact, by your expression of understanding them, you may be showing them

225
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:56,910
that after all, cruel is not as cruel as it appears to be.

226
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:04,320
And the responsibility of the doctor in general, I feel, to be human

227
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:13,830
and have understanding to the patient and that's why orthodox Medicine has failed

228
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:18,920
as it became mechanistic and industrialized.

229
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:27,920
They thought that they could bring pharmaceutical industries into the consulting room.

230
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,820
And that is the failure of allopathic Medicine.

231
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:40,580
That is why Homeopathy is spreading like fire now and is going to spread so quickly

232
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:46,060
that I'm telling you for those of you who are practitioners that you have to learn quickly

233
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:51,330
because the demand will be so great in the next 10 years

234
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:54,920
that people will go crazy with Homeopathy.

235
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:57,820
I tell you, prepare.

236
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:06,520
This was the great anxiety, I had it Greece, when people saw the result

237
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:15,210
they crowded in the consulting rooms and then I had to train one doctor,

238
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:22,960
then two, then 5, 10 but the impact was always greater than I could train doctors.

239
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:30,210
From 1970 there were big, influential people coming, that they own big magazines

240
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:37,790
and say, we're interested to write a piece, no I don't want, I said please don't write anything.

241
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:44,140
In newspapers, you can not imagine in how many newspapers I said no.

242
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:49,040
Because I wanted to prepare the ground for the impact.

243
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:53,790
Now the impact is happening but now they are enough doctors here in Greece,

244
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:58,300
since two years I'm not teaching anymore in Greece, because I'm all over the places

245
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:06,830
but my students are teaching a big group of students.

246
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:17,180
Now they can write in newspapers. And you know how fast it happens

247
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:25,680
and if you can deliver it and you can show the effect, then Homeopathy is going to grow

248
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:30,530
and is going to take the place that it deserves.

249
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:45,270
We come now to the blockages that may exist on mental or spiritual level

250
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:51,370
that can prevent homeopathic remedy to act.

251
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:07,020
The first group, that I found it difficult to treat and to penetrate in deeper level,

252
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:19,350
as we have said. To bring about a real change in health, not to take away simply the symptoms.

253
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,960
I hope you understand what I'm talking about.

254
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:31,860
To bring about a change in health, which is as if the person has jumped a level in his health;

255
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:42,110
he has been regenerated. The person that will say, I feel 10 years younger, I feel much better

256
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:46,110
as I felt 20 years ago.

257
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:51,530
This is the kind of jump that we are talking about now.

258
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:58,190
You may be treating all these individuals, that we have mentioned in the different groups

259
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:03,030
and you may be having some effect but not that effect.

260
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:13,370
So the first group that you will find difficult to find such an effect will be a group

261
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:19,040
which is becoming more and more prominent in our society.

262
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:27,110
It is the group that mostly will come to you to be treated at this stage

263
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:34,700
and they will say I understand Homeopathy. This group is the spiritual seekers.

264
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:45,100
The seekers after spiritual truth, not all of them, don't misunderstand me.

265
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:56,930
There is a type of person that has been frustrated, has gone through a lot of frustration

266
00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:05,540
in his life and eventually he has decided to become a spiritual person.

267
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:15,690
This person does not go through a kind of spiritual evolvement

268
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:25,940
but he becomes very soon a kind of spiritual person, which is having

269
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:34,620
a specific kind of behavior, a specific kind of talking, a specific kind of dealing with problems.

270
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:44,020
He has a prototype, a model, which he wears and he acts. It is the spiritual person

271
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:57,710
which he will be attaching himself to a guru. You know guru? I want to see hands. Everybody.

272
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:09,950
A spiritual teacher. You know I can make my statistics also.

273
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:16,600
When I speak to so many audiences in so many countries I have to know what is going

274
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:22,040
on, quickly. This is a quick way of knowing what's going on.

275
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:30,740
So everybody knows the guru and has an idea of what spirituality is,

276
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:42,490
especially eastern type of spirituality and this is a kind of a disturbance

277
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:51,250
that has been prevalent in the western world because people out of frustration,

278
00:38:51,350 --> 00:39:01,420
out of problems, that have arised because of the way that we live in our societies

279
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:13,660
in western world, they will turn towards the eastern and further religions trying to find out

280
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:18,350
a resolution to their problems.

281
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:26,030
Because the frustration is too much, because the urgency of finding a solution is so great

282
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:33,280
these people many times, I'm talking about a particular group, they become spiritual suddenly

283
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:40,770
from one day to the other, talking to a particular kind of voice, the voice is very low,

284
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:48,780
you don't have to disturb the environment and then you have to be very humble

285
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,090
and everybody who is humble, is spiritual.

286
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:59,530
And you have to eat the right type of food which is yin and yan.

287
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:14,440
Never eat together raisins together with almonds.

288
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:31,770
This is a kind of person that will come to you and what you feel is that they have lost the life,

289
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:40,770
the life is gone away from them. When they come to you they are so humble

290
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:45,620
the idea of humbleness is there, not that they are humble.

291
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:50,440
Because you can not become humble from one day to the other.

292
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:56,280
To hold above the selfish and the egotistical element, which is in us,

293
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:59,520
within one month or one year?

294
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:04,940
Forget it. People are struggling their whole life, in monasteries,

295
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:09,440
serious people are struggling to hold this monster which is inside us,

296
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:16,370
which is called the egotistical and selfish element, for years. It is very systematic work.

297
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:27,270
Now suddenly they have reduced it so much that there is nothing there,

298
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:39,020
there is no life actually, left in these people. This is a shock to the immunity system,

299
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,600
to the defense system.

300
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:47,220
The defense system does not have anymore the possibility to produce symptoms.

301
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:49,940
Do you understand what they do to themselves?

302
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,280
And they come to you, they are your best customers.

303
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:59,520
Because they are the people who first of all will understand Homeopathy,

304
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,970
the truth of Homeopathy and they will say yes.

305
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:10,370
It is an ecological, the most natural way of healing.

306
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:13,770
But they are not saying it in the way I'm saying it, of course.

307
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:18,270
They will say it in a very humble way. I've understood.

308
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:26,210
When I see these cases I say, oh my god what can it be the remedy?

309
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:36,120
Because they will not give you symptoms but general fatigue, general weakness symptoms

310
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,950
and general absurd.

311
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:46,270
You see the symptoms, when somebody has a headache, my god I have a headache.

312
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:49,520
Where is the headache? Here. That's very clear symptom.

313
00:42:49,620 --> 00:43:04,620
You ask them, do you have a headache? Yes. Where? Well, I think all over.

314
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:17,130
You are going to have and to treat these people and to help them also.

315
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:44,020
And then the symptoms are so much subdued almost, you feel that there is no district symptom.

316
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:49,020
You see, what you would like is a definite symptom in a case

317
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:55,270
on which to base your prescription whether it's a local symptom, it's a pain,

318
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:59,270
a severe pain it's a good symptom. You can base your prescription.

319
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:06,130
In these cases you will find no concrete, definite symptom on which you can prescribe.

320
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:13,550
What is always is a little thing coming and going, I have this and I have that

321
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:19,530
and that kind of indigestion. What kind of indigestion?

322
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:33,030
Well if I eat vegetables with ... I mean to hear that you say, my god.

323
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:38,780
Even if he tells you that you can not feel that you have a symptom,

324
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,770
that you can rely on that symptom.

325
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:54,940
These cases are very difficult to treat and not only they are difficult to treat

326
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:03,700
but they will drive you to despair because they will come again and again and again.

327
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:09,870
And they are the same, almost no change.

328
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:19,530
I found that Sepia produces this kind of state very much. So you just remember.

329
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:27,280
You see in these cases, you will see the basic instincts of self-preservation

330
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:33,870
and sexual instincts They are so much subdued that they don't exist.

331
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:39,190
You will say, do you want to eat? I don't know if I want to eat. Do you have an appetite?

332
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:43,110
I don't know if I have an appetite. They have cut down their appetites

333
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:47,020
whether it's sexual or physical, for food.

334
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:56,510
This is an imposition of the intellect upon the human body looking upon a model

335
00:45:56,610 --> 00:46:02,770
and making that model himself and acting as if he is that model, that spiritual person,

336
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:04,780
that spiritual man.

337
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:10,120
Spiritual seekers, they have to be the most aggressive.

338
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:15,980
I want to find the truth and I want to find what is going on is the most aggressive thing

339
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,540
that you can ask.

340
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:21,200
You can not be like that and find the truth.

341
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:24,950
Because what you will find is somebody who will tell you certain things

342
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:30,290
and then you believe and then you become the follower of [name].

343
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:41,050
You see statistics again. Who knows [name]...?

344
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,710
In the newspapers had written about him. Everybody must know.

345
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:56,440
Now this type of persons have come to me to be treated and I found it very difficult to cure,

346
00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:02,340
to penetrate, to understand what is wrong with them, with their system.

347
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:06,620
They are so careful also, eating this and not eating that,

348
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:14,690
that the organism has the least possible reaction to this diet.

349
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:31,610
Once I was treating a French boy, he was a very rich boy and he invited me to his house

350
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:37,280
and then I found out how he was living. I was trying to find his remedy; it was not possible.

351
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:43,920
He was a vegetarian, he was such a freak concerning the food. Don't eat this and that.

352
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:53,350
His cat was not eating all kind of food, his cat had to eat one day yin and the other yen.

353
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:03,630
His cat! I said, give it some fish.

354
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:08,820
You know cats like to eat fish or some meat, not vegetables.

355
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:16,170
It will become sick with the vegetables. He said, no, no.

356
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:26,980
So you understand this type of person. To say I'm not interested about truth,

357
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:32,480
about why I'm here, what's going on, what is happening?

358
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:38,570
These are legitimate questions that everybody should ask. I do not talk about this kind.

359
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:44,320
I'm talking about a specific type of person that has most,

360
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:52,920
99,9% has gone through an aggressive period of drugs.

361
00:48:54,930 --> 00:49:02,400
Doing a lot of drugs, taking the marihuana, the heroin, taking LCD and all these

362
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:08,980
and then breaking down his mind completely. And then you see a broken down individual

363
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:12,410
because of too much drugs.

364
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:27,670
Who was in Alonissos in the course? Was anybody there 2 years ago with the American group?

365
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:44,080
You must remember a case, an American woman was brought to me to treat in front of the class,

366
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:45,820
so I did not know the woman.

367
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:59,050
I just looked at her and then I looked again and I said, have you been a hippy? She was shocked.

368
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:03,400
She said, yes I have living a hippy life for the last 10 years.

369
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:14,150
Of course I could see it in the completely broken down constitution. This type.

370
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:30,220
She reacted very well to China. She did very well actually but the imprint of drugs was there

371
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:34,220
and in America when we are in a class, I would tell the class,

372
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:37,070
do you want me to tell you who is taking drugs?

373
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:47,050
And everybody says, as you understand, no. So I'm talking about that particular person

374
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:53,050
who has taken drugs, has become a seeker eventually, a seeker of truth,

375
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:55,290
a seeker of experiences.

376
00:50:55,390 --> 00:50:59,050
He has some experiences because these drugs will give you some experiences

377
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:03,800
but they are artificial, they will not stay there and they will leave you with the sense

378
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:07,650
of dissatisfaction and incompleteness.

379
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:12,900
A yearning for something that is not yours.

380
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:20,900
And these drugs can also give you some bad experiences as well.

381
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:26,230
And that person, he is spiritual, he will produce symptoms.

382
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:47,370
It comes when a person lives to the top of its possibility for happiness.

383
00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:50,380
Everyone of us has a possibility of happiness.

384
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,880
Some have bigger possibilities, some have less possibilities

385
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:59,870
but when you are at the top of your possibility for happiness, this is a spiritual state.

386
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:03,610
In that state you can not do harm, you can always be creative.

387
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:09,710
You can always have clear mind, clear ideas, that's a spiritual state.

388
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:18,610
And this state can come about by playing a nice piece in the piano

389
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:24,610
or having a good conversation or having a love affair.

390
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:28,780
I mean any such situation can bring about such state.

391
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:33,300
You don't have to bring it artificially by drugs.

392
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:58,080
A second group of people that you will find difficult to treat is people with fixed ideas.

393
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:17,610
Now we didn't say how you handle this first group, what are you going to do with this group

394
00:53:17,710 --> 00:53:21,870
and what is the possibility for changing them.

395
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:30,200
There is very little possibility to do anything with this group. You don't try to change them.

396
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:36,060
You don't try to talk to them. They are going to be through their experiences.

397
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:43,950
And they are going to find out in a very bitter way what is to be pretending

398
00:53:44,050 --> 00:53:53,700
and what is to follow a guru, who is not a real guru, who does not know anything.

399
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:57,800
Who knows perhaps less than his students.

400
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:05,290
Then, when they find out, then they will react, they will become angry,

401
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:09,280
they will have big symptoms, strong symptoms.

402
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:16,730
Then it's the time that you may be able to interview and treat and perhaps help them.

403
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:25,120
Or if you are lucky and strike the remedy in spite of the lack of symptoms,

404
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:28,630
there might be a possibility that these people will see the truth,

405
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:31,370
will see what they are doing and they will change their style of life.

406
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:35,300
Unless they change their style of life, there is no hope.

407
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:47,310
So these fixed ideas like sex is bad in general.

408
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:56,790
Now this comes in certain cases of people, men or women especially women,

409
00:54:56,890 --> 00:55:03,720
who have the psychology of a spinster.

410
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,370
They have the psychology of a spinster, it's not that they are not married.

411
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:10,290
Many women today are living without being married.

412
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:12,700
This has nothing to do with what I'm talking about.

413
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:21,790
The fixed idea that sex is bad and therefore changing the hormonal system within the body,

414
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:28,700
it's going to give a state which most probably you will not be able to penetrate

415
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:34,450
with your treatment, you will not be able to change this hormonal system

416
00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:38,810
that has been suppressed by such ideas.

417
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:50,700
In this category come all the hypochondriacs and also those people

418
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:59,190
with fixed ideas concerning diet. That' another kind. They have very fixed ideas concerning diet.

419
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:02,530
Their whole life is what will cook and what will eat.

420
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:09,860
If a person has become from morning till night will thinking what am I going to cook for eat,

421
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:17,110
that is an unhealthy state of mind that is creating an unhealthiness in the body,

422
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:22,440
which is not again penetrated by the homeopathic remedy.

423
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:26,790
You will not be able to find the correct remedy.

424
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:38,940
These people seem to have immobilize a flow of life which seems to be necessary

425
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:42,040
for the natural functioning of the body.

426
00:56:45,790 --> 00:57:00,030
The third group will be the intellectuals. You see with the intellectuals, what has happened.

427
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:11,190
They have thought out everything and they know the explanation for everything that has happened

428
00:57:11,290 --> 00:57:14,040
and they can explain away, everything.

429
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:22,130
And they have planned their whole life and they are going according to that.

430
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:34,270
They have planned what they are going to do whether they have a dinner or a sex etc.

431
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:38,270
On Friday we are having sex and Saturday they have dinner with people.

432
00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:45,280
I mean everything comes through the mind. What happens with these people?

433
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:54,840
They come for the consultation and this group of people they will be either very much

434
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:58,590
in favor for Homeopathy, because they read something and they know about Homeopathy

435
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:05,940
or they will be great skeptics and they will come and will tell you, I'm not convinced.

436
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:19,930
So you have to convince me or they will say, I read your books and I find it very correct.

437
00:58:21,690 --> 00:58:26,940
But when you try to take their symptoms, it's another story.

438
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:35,440
You're asking a simple question like do you feel cold or do you feel warm?

439
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:41,940
Are you aggravated by heat or by cold? And they will not be able to answer.

440
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:50,420
I mean the answer is either I'm aggravated by heat or I'm aggravated by cold or I don't care.

441
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:54,760
Too much heat I can take, too much cold I can take. These are the three answers I can give.

442
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:59,100
Do you think an individual like this will answer you like this? Never.

443
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:05,410
Or you can say, in the beginning I think I' m aggravated by cold.

444
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:11,010
Then you proceed in your examination and you cross examine because you're going to prescribe

445
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:18,750
a cold remedy. You think it's Rhus tox or Calcarea carb. or Arsenicum for the intellectuals

446
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:25,420
that fits very well with the fastitudeness of Arsenicum and you want to confirm

447
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,420
whether he is really cold or not.

448
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:34,170
And then you say, you have said to me that you are aggravated by cold,

449
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:37,920
you don't look at him, you say it just casually.

450
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:48,170
He understands now that you are thinking seriously of what he has said and immediately will go back

451
00:59:48,270 --> 00:59:55,240
and will think, wait a moment, not exactly I didn't say I was aggravated by cold.

452
00:59:55,340 --> 01:00:04,000
OK, what now? I think, I tell you the situation in which I can be aggravated,

453
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:10,500
if I am in a room and the third window on the right is open and also there is a door

454
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:15,910
which is half open on the other side, I may feel the draft.

455
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:21,590
But if I'm sitting on the corner where two windows are open and one closed...

456
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:31,740
Then you ask, what about being outside, do you feel warm, do you feel cold?

457
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:38,330
Do you wear more clothes than other people etc.? Well, it depends where I'm going.

458
01:00:39,090 --> 01:00:47,490
If I'm going to a place where I had to go with a car, I wear light clothes,

459
01:00:47,590 --> 01:00:56,010
in other case I wear warm clothes and then they go on like that with every symptom, and no answer.

460
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:58,510
Do you like in your food salt?

461
01:00:58,610 --> 01:01:08,170
No. Don't you like salt because you've read in some book that salt is bad for health?

462
01:01:09,430 --> 01:01:12,930
It maybe that but still I don't like salt.

463
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:20,050
You read that it's not good; therefore you stopped eating salt. Yes, I'm not eating salt.

464
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:24,050
Since when did you stop eating salt? Many years ago.

465
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:27,990
Before reading the book or after reading the book?

466
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:39,060
In the end of such case you have no symptom to rely upon.

467
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:46,140
They have given you an information which they change it in the course of the interrogation.

468
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:50,790
Now what kind of symptomatology you are taking to base your prescription

469
01:01:50,890 --> 01:01:52,780
and what type of a person you have in front of you?

470
01:01:55,650 --> 01:02:06,280
Another thing. They will give you their case usually with the exact words of the different doctors

471
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:09,390
that have been consulting before you.

472
01:02:11,650 --> 01:02:23,550
They will say that I have a duodenal ulcer or an ulcer on the stomach

473
01:02:23,650 --> 01:02:30,030
and it has been diagnosed by such and such doctor, the explanation is this,

474
01:02:30,130 --> 01:02:35,780
this and that and the examinations, they pull out all the examinations.

475
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:38,830
And you will say, what are your symptoms? What do you feel?

476
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:41,720
You have the ulcer but do you feel anything?

477
01:02:44,730 --> 01:02:49,870
And then it starts, when I eat this and that together with this

478
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:57,640
in order not to have these symptoms etc. you go on and on. Finally you have no symptoms at all.

479
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:09,140
What are you going to do with such individuals? What is the strategy?

480
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:17,540
Because in the end for the case you have no information to prescribe upon

481
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,890
except of the pathology.

482
01:03:20,890 --> 01:03:33,130
So what you do is you tell them to come back again for another consultation

483
01:03:33,230 --> 01:03:36,890
because you did not understand his case.

484
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:42,630
Do you think they won't like it? No, they will enjoy it very much.

485
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:48,110
They will say, ah I' m a difficult case and I understand I'm a difficult case

486
01:03:48,210 --> 01:03:50,120
and that's why he understood.

487
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:56,130
He starts to understand me, therefore he is quite good.

488
01:03:56,230 --> 01:04:03,110
He will come again and again and unless you have really the information,

489
01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:07,950
do not prescribe in such cases because eventually you're going to lose your case.

490
01:04:08,050 --> 01:04:14,620
He will go away and say, he did nothing for me. Tell him I still don't understand your case.

491
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:20,610
Either you will answer me straight or I'm not going to give you a remedy.

492
01:04:20,710 --> 01:04:27,890
I want to find out what is going on. And they will love it. They will come again and again.

493
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:38,710
Also these individuals will have peculiar symptoms that they will not tell you from first

494
01:04:38,810 --> 01:04:40,440
or second consultation.

495
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:47,980
They will tell you after they have established a very good contact with you.

496
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:53,530
And then they open up and one day they are going to give you their cases.

497
01:04:53,630 --> 01:04:55,880
They will speak from the heart.

498
01:04:57,390 --> 01:05:03,290
But when they come from the beginning is impossible for them to speak from the heart

499
01:05:03,390 --> 01:05:07,630
from what is happening, simple facts.

500
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:14,130
They will give you everything which is in the mind but not what is happening really in the body.

501
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:30,360
During their treatment also, it will be interesting to find out that in such cases

502
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:35,660
you will have anxieties and fears coming up during the treatment,

503
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:38,840
that they were not accepted in the beginning.

504
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:48,220
A lot of fears and a lot of anxieties that were kept under control by sheer intellectual power.

505
01:05:49,970 --> 01:05:56,300
As they are loosen up, they start more to feel their fears, their insecurities, their anxieties

506
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:05,130
and then they will give out the symptoms and then you will be able to prescribe more correctly.

507
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:19,130
There is a fourth group of patients.

508
01:06:22,130 --> 01:06:30,130
That's a peculiar group that they don't want any kind of dependency upon the doctor.

509
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:36,450
So when they come to give you the feedback of what happened with their treatment

510
01:06:36,550 --> 01:06:44,360
they will tell you, even if the treatment is correct, that maybe I'm better

511
01:06:44,460 --> 01:06:50,360
but most probably I'm better because somebody else has done something else on me

512
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:55,960
or I have done something and that's why I'm better, not because of your remedy.

513
01:06:57,210 --> 01:07:02,850
So you have to be very careful with these individuals because there is an inborn fear

514
01:07:02,950 --> 01:07:06,610
that they may depend on somebody, if they tell you that I'm better

515
01:07:06,710 --> 01:07:11,450
with this remedy you gave me, that they will depend on that.

516
01:07:13,210 --> 01:07:18,100
It's a sick state of mind again because after all what is more common,

517
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:27,350
more natural if you want to get food, you go to the bakery and you buy some bread.

518
01:07:27,450 --> 01:07:31,780
You depend on the baker who makes the food. Of course you depend.

519
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:36,600
If he closes, you will have no food. It's the same. You need a remedy,

520
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:41,600
you go to the doctor, you ask, the doctor gives you, you pay him and it's finished.

521
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:43,850
These individuals take it completely different.

522
01:07:43,950 --> 01:07:50,190
It is very important that they will not depend. They will not feel the dependency upon.

523
01:07:50,290 --> 01:07:56,270
Therefore when you gave the remedy, they took it, they felt better

524
01:07:56,370 --> 01:08:00,770
but at the same time they were drinking some kind of special water.

525
01:08:00,870 --> 01:08:02,770
So maybe it's the water I was drinking.

526
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:06,770
That special water that made me feel better and not your remedy.

527
01:08:06,870 --> 01:08:12,020
Maybe somebody else gave me a remedy and that remedy or I went to acupuncture

528
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:18,530
and I think the acupuncture did well and not you.

529
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:22,030
Now he goes to the acupuncturist and he tells the same story about you.

530
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:25,280
I went to a homeopath and he gave me a remedy and I'm not sure exactly

531
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:27,350
that the acupuncture did it or the remedy.

532
01:08:27,450 --> 01:08:34,610
That group of people feel a great insecurity to have this kind of dependency.

533
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:48,590
Now what may happens with these people is you don't tell them, don't contrast them

534
01:08:48,690 --> 01:08:56,510
and say, it's the remedy I gave you. Let them believe whatever they think.

535
01:08:56,610 --> 01:09:07,780
And eventually they will become so much convinced, that they will really depend upon you.

536
01:09:10,030 --> 01:09:20,190
And then you can handle the situation and you can take away that inborn fear.

537
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:25,950
And you can tell them, you don't owe me anything, this is my job.

538
01:09:26,050 --> 01:09:30,430
This is what I have to do. I have to cure people. You don't owe me anything.

539
01:09:30,530 --> 01:09:36,520
You pay me a visit and that's all and go away now.

540
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:39,860
Whenever you need, you may come again.

541
01:09:40,370 --> 01:09:44,360
And then there is a healthy kind of transaction.

542
01:09:45,610 --> 01:09:56,620
This group of people is a very small group but sometimes you will see it.

543
01:09:56,860 --> 01:10:13,700
So all these cases I gave you represent about 70% of your clients.

544
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:20,710
Actually the rate of success of Homeopathy should be between 80-90%.

545
01:10:22,190 --> 01:10:23,940
It should be. It's not.
