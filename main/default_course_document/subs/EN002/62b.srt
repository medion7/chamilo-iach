1
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:36,560
I would like to point out more specifically what we may encounter as problems and obstacles in homeopathic prescribing.

2
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:52,520
So we have to be aware of such obstacles. We're talking about physical obstacles. Mechanical.

3
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:12,020
You have a sciatica and you prescribe the correct remedies which either act for a very short time or they don't reduce the pain.

4
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:23,760
The pain is severe, you prescribe, they don't act. Most probably what happens we have a mechanical obstacle.

5
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:35,520
For instance we have a herniated disc and this is pressing upon a nerve.

6
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:43,100
If we try to cure such case with Homeopathy, forget it, we just waste our time.

7
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:55,600
We need some mechanical means which are either you put him in bed or you call a chiropractor to see

8
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:08,700
 if he can reduce the pressure or you operate.
 It's not possible to reduce the pain in such cases.

9
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:36,070
There is an old woman 74, 78, she comes to you with severe constipation and you prescribe correctly and there is no effect.

10
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:46,700
Suspect always that there might be a tumor which is just obstructing and still not giving symptoms,

11
00:02:46,800 --> 00:03:01,880
not giving blood, not giving pains it just gives constipation, very little stool and general discomfort.

12
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:18,290
If you try to reduce this tumor without an operation, most probably you will have a dead case.

13
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:31,320
So you have to investigate to find out whether there is an obstruction, a tumor, then you operate, then you prescribe.

14
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:43,100
We have such cases which are living quite many years after such operations, there is no question about that.

15
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:50,400
But if you try again and again to give one remedy after the other and there is no effect, no effect and

16
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:58,820
no stool is coming out and you insist without thinking that you may have a mechanical obstruction,

17
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:08,550
 this is a serious mistake that you may have problems also legal.

18
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:32,470
There was a case with tremendous irritation of the eye, the eye was red. You give remedy after remedy

19
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:40,960
and the redness stays there and then it goes and be examined by an ophthalmologist very carefully

20
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:47,520
and there is a very tiny splinter of metal.

21
00:04:54,290 --> 00:05:10,380
So always when you prescribe and especially if you have a clear case and there is no effect, suspect

22
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:18,200
that you may have a mechanical problem
 and try to see if there is such a problem.

23
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:35,890
Another obstacle to cure is chemical drugs in general.

24
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:43,610
The most common is?

25
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,450
-Antibiotics?

26
00:05:48,730 --> 00:06:02,940
-No, coffee. Coffee is one of the main obstacles to cure homeopathically unfortunately.

27
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:10,140
We have this problem because many people are used to drink coffee and they don't want to stop it

28
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,420
and we're in bad terms with such patients.

29
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:36,420
Of course if you go further than that we have the recreational, so called, drugs especially heroine and cocaine,

30
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:55,380
also marihuana is an impediment to cure. If somebody regularly takes marihuana you cannot cure.

31
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:01,740
If they don't tell you, what happens is you prescribe a remedy, they do well for certain time, then there is a relapse.

32
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:10,250
Then there is a different remedy, then you prescribe again, then there is a relapse. You can go on and then

33
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:21,510
at a certain moment you ask, are you taking marihuana? He says, yes why? It's not a habit for me, you know these theories.

34
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:36,820
I don't care whether it is habit forming. It is antidoting an organism which tries to reach balance,

35
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,790
unbalances the organism.

36
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:52,630
You give a remedy, again marihuana. Of course cocaine is much faster in doing this and of course heroin.

37
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:03,110
But it is not only these non-prescribed drugs, also the prescribed drugs of that type which is

38
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:15,440
the valium, the Tavor, all these
 antidepressants, tranquilizers.

39
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:19,790
This was with severe headaches
 with some problems in the stomach.

40
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:32,910
He was taking something with
 codeine for the headaches.

41
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:41,560
We gave a remedy, the headaches went
away but he kept on taking the pain killer.

42
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:54,340
He says, I feel so good if I take this. He even felt better than before. And then of course there was a relapse.

43
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:26,960
Cafergot etc., which are very strong drugs and that's why the research they did on chronic headaches

44
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:33,460
in Germany was a total failure because they allowed the patient to continue taking the drugs

45
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,730
while taking the homeopathic remedy.

46
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:44,070
They gave one potency and then they allowed taking Cafergot and the painkillers and of course it was a disaster.

47
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:56,430
I don't know how these Homeopaths, some of them were my students, they've heard these many times

48
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:00,920
how they kept on doing these things.

49
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:19,250
There are some other cases which I call miasmatic cases.

50
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:40,390
-There are some people proclaiming that you can drink coffee during homeopathic treatment and then it antidotes

51
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:58,140
only few cases. What do you think about that?They say it antidotes only in a low percentage.

52
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,380
-I don't agree.

53
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,540
-What is your percentage rate?

54
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:12,650
-My percentage is 100 % depending on the length of time. One will be antidoted after a week of coffee.

55
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:16,720
Another after two weeks, another after 2 years.

56
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:26,700
If 1% stays without being antidoted with coffee,
 I will be still doubtful. I know only one case.

57
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:41,140
If you stay well for 3-5 years and you have a strong organism, that means you were a clear Tarentula case.

58
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:47,660
Strong organism, you gave Tarentula 50M, 3 years, you didn't drink coffee. Most probably after 3 years

59
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:55,250
you can drink coffee. But while you're taking Tarentula to go and drink coffee at the same time, forget it.

60
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:05,880
The coffee issue is a big and difficult one.

61
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:10,020
-One practical question. After the patient
has come back to health and then

62
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:15,410
he starts to drink coffee
can he antidote afterwards?

63
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,050
Can he get a relapse afterwards?

64
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:43,400
-Yes he can. He may not but it can be antidoted, even after 2 years of being well if he starts drinking coffee, he can.

65
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:52,400
-Most patients immediately if I tell them not to drink coffee they come with tea. What about this issue?

66
00:13:52,500 --> 00:14:02,670
-They can drink tea, it is true. If you drink tea there is no antidotal influence unless if one in 10.000,

67
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:09,900
they are sensitive to tea. They drink tea and they have palpitations. In this case stop it.

68
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,840
If they tell you a reaction
 like that, you have to stop it immediately.

69
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,530
-Otherwise they can.

70
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:27,330
-Otherwise it's ok. Also cocoa, also milk with cocoa. Also decaffeinated, no problem.

71
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:36,860
I have seen some problems in cases where they have gastritis and they drink decaffeinated.

72
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:51,130
These chemical things which contains of course can create a problem, more burning and pain but not antidoting the remedy.

73
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:58,540
-So you are saying that in all instances or most instances, drinking decaffeinated coffee,

74
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,270
 woll have no effect in homeopathic treatment?

75
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:11,740
-No, in all cases they will have no antidoting influence but it can irritate the stomach.

76
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:17,140
-What if there is no gastrointestinal irritation then it's perfectly fine for patients to drink decaffeinated.

77
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,850
-Yes, in my experience.

78
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:28,580
-Because I have patients who have both antidoted with regular coffee and also antidote it with decaffeinated coffee

79
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:42,080
and don't seem to have any kind of previous gastro-intestinal sensitivity to coffee, both decaffeinated or regular.

80
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:46,360
 I will make my patients extremely happy to tell them they can drink decaffeinated coffee.

81
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:56,070
-They can, as far as my experience is concerned. But there might somebody who will tell you,

82
00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:02,840
I smell coffee and I got a relapse.

83
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:11,330
I don't believe it. I believe that my remedy was not correct and it was a placebo effect and

84
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:22,140
with the least provocation the person says, I have a relapse and then I try, most probably, to find another remedy.

85
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:34,900
I have a case of Phosphorus and you tell Phosphorus, don't drink coffee. Phosphorus accepts this

86
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:44,840
and it's always in his mind because he's suffering a lot with anxiety. Then they offer him some ice-cream

87
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:57,170
and he takes the ice-cream and suddenly he tastes the coffee and in front of everybody he spits out the coffee.

88
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:09,300
  He can't be antidoting. He can tell you, I antidoted the treatment.

89
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:18,310
The fact is you have not given Phosphorus to him, you have given Arsenicum or Nitric acid

90
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:21,220
and then you think about Phosphorus.

91
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:27,840
You better give him Phosphorus now
because he is very impressionable.

92
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:47,490
He is very auto-suggesting patient and with auto-suggestion you can do a lot. They say 40% you can cure.

93
00:17:51,480 --> 00:18:02,000
It is amazing how many of our patients come and tell you how well they feel even with the placebo.

94
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:14,530
We have to have this in mind very well. A cure is not, I feel better. A cure is you have to have certain things

95
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:19,280
happening in that organism. Then you know that this is a cure.

96
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:28,540
I remember a woman who came here in Alonissos, she was very nice and she was a Homeopath and we discussed.

97
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:39,940
Suddenly I find out she says, I don't
 use remedies. What do you use?

98
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,290
I have my own potentiser which I potentise.

99
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:55,040
It is a machine in which I put a sugar, I turn and it says, Pulsatilla 10M because the machine vibrates.

100
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:02,740
You turn it a little bit more and it's Sulphur 50, you turn it a little bit more and it's Calcarea carbonica.

101
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:13,710
And your patients are doing well? She says, yes all my patients. All is an exaggeration always.

102
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:29,740
This is clearly a placebo effect, she was very nice. There is no question about that, don't even think for a second time.

103
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:44,400
What is the problem with the placebo effect? There is no problem. Well good but don't claim you cure cases.

104
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:53,300
These are for simple things and to feel better for a while and the patient comes back again and again,

105
00:19:53,400 --> 00:20:02,940
he has this and that etc. Not that you're really touching the case with the indicated remedy.

106
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:33,580
Miasmatic obstacles is in certain cases. I see the well-indicated remedies do not give an effect and you struggle

107
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:43,380
with these cases and you go through their histories and their parents etc. and you try to find out

108
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:52,180
if there is a kind of a miasmatic layer which prevents your remedies from acting.

109
00:20:52,280 --> 00:21:00,880
What is this miasmatic layer? For instance is a case which I remember, a quinine case, a China Sulphurica case,

110
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:09,890
quinine was taken by the parents of a woman.
The woman at a very early age, 12-13 developed headaches.

111
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:18,010
 She came to us at the age of 28-29 with
 severe headaches and she was a wreck.

112
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:30,130
We prescribed several remedies, no effect. At a certain point her case indicated a little bit of China Sulphurica.

113
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:43,570
I said to her 'have you taken quinine?'. 'No'. 'Your parents?', 'No'. 'How do you say no? Do you know your parents

114
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:54,260
before your birth what they were taking? I said, I will not give you a remedy. You go and ask your parents whether

115
00:21:54,360 --> 00:22:08,100
your father or mother took a lot of quinine before your birth'. She went back there and said, 'my father lived in Africa

116
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:19,580
where he had to take quinine every day before I was born'. China Sulphurica opened up the case and then she was cured.

117
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:40,120
Another case I will tell you. A doctor lost his voice totally, he says, I have to give up my practice, total paralysis.

118
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:45,730
I gave this remedy, this remedy, this remedy, no effect.

119
00:22:51,980 --> 00:23:01,290
 I said, what about diphtheria?
Did you have diphtheria as a child?

120
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:15,520
He said, yes. Very good, take a dose of Diphtherinum 200. Of course it opened up the case and then Gelsemium.

121
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:23,280
Before he had taken Gelsemium, Argentum nitricum, Causticum, Phosphorus the whole lot, nothing, no effect.

122
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:37,640
With Diphtherinum which has stayed as a miasmatic layer for him, which can go on in the children also.

123
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:44,720
His children may at certain point need Diphtherinum.

124
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:57,140
The same thing I found out with Penicillin,
 people who have taken penicillin a lot

125
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:08,490
and created a kind of a miasm,
it can block your prescription

126
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:17,220
and unless they take Penicillin 200, 1M, then it opens up the case. The same with cortisone.

127
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:30,590
We have certain chemical drugs which can create a kind of a miasmatic layer and we have to be aware

128
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:39,100
if no remedy is giving effect,
 to investigate on these levels.

129
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:52,640
Permanent organ damage.

130
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:33,000
You see when I did this explanation to you before nobody asked me about the Down syndrome.

131
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:49,590
These children, as you know, are mentally retarded. Mongoloid children, mentally retarded very strongly.

132
00:25:50,920 --> 00:26:03,880
Yet they have many times severe acute conditions which are treated and the mental condition does not change.

133
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:26,030
What happens here is that, we have to separate between permanent damage of an organ

134
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:38,870
and a process of inflammation,
a process of degeneration.

135
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:51,750
The permanent damage is a calcification, you get for instance in these old tuberculous patients, treated

136
00:26:51,850 --> 00:27:03,220
or non treated and then you see in the X-rays calcifications in the lungs, areas which are calcified.

137
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:09,600
These areas are permanent organ damage.

138
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:20,740
Such permanent organ damage, the organism does not consider them as a process.

139
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:31,750
It considers it as dead tissues. Therefore
it is not considered as a process of disease.

140
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:46,580
 So if a brain is born with a damage which
 is permanent, it's not a process, it's not

141
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:58,100
a blow and then hematoma and then tumor forming but it is permanent as it is in Down syndrome,

142
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:04,690
 then the organism does not take
it into consideration in these points.

143
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:13,520
-A hysterectomy ?

144
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:34,420
-A hysterectomy no, because once the hysterectomy is out not because of a process but because of

145
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:42,670
 calcification of fibroids that means the process has stopped before the operation,

146
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:45,330
the organism does not consider it as a disease.

147
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:53,740
But if you take out the uterus but the uterus already has started a process of, let us say,

148
00:28:53,840 --> 00:29:06,170
developing cancer, then this will be considered not obstacle but as difficulty in curing.

149
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:25,660
Dead tissues, a process happened, an inflammation happened and there is calcification

150
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:39,880
and there is even encysted, there is no interference of the organism with this process.

151
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:49,500
The organism takes part in anything which is alive, which is going on, degenerating,

152
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,100
the organism takes part in this.

153
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:06,440
-One question. What about
calcification of lymph nodes?

154
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:18,920
-This calcification is not taking part in the process. That means you give a remedy,

155
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:22,340
you don't expect the calcification to go away.

156
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:41,180
You don't expect that these dead tissues will be alive again and if these dead tissues are in the heart,

157
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:51,430
it's a permanent damage. You don't expect
to cure, if these tissues are in the nerve sheaths,

158
00:30:51,960 --> 00:31:02,720
 this you don't expect to cure. The dead tissues for instance in Multiple Sclerosis of several years,

159
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:12,830
 there are the plaques which are formed and are a permanent damage, this is an impediment to cure.

160
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:17,200
You cannot proceed further than that point.

161
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:33,240
- Is it a proof that there is a Tubercular miasm? Because of the calcified lymph nodes?

162
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:47,820
-Yes it is a proof that we have Tuberculosis and Tuberculinum or Baccilinum can be used, there is no question about that.

163
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:56,070
What I say is when you have a permanent damage you cannot overcome it. It is an impediment to cure.

164
00:31:56,170 --> 00:32:04,050
You cannot push it out of the way. Sometimes this calcification in the lungs doesn't do anything, it's ok.

165
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:12,620
But if it is calcification on the brain, that portion is finished, you will never get it back.

166
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:25,430
If this calcification is on one kidney, this kidney is not functioning anymore, you cannot get it back.

167
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:36,690
The organism is going as far as working with one kidney, working with one lung, working with half brain.

168
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:44,360
You cannot overcome such impediments.

169
00:32:51,130 --> 00:33:03,530
-I just would like to correct you because I am a friend of a patient that did just now MRI and she suffers from M.S.

170
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:11,940
and most of them are gone, the plaques, we don't see them anymore after treatment.

171
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:20,500
-That means they were not permanent. They were in the process of inflammation. You see before they reach

172
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:40,980
this dead level, they inflame and there is a kind of edema around it, inflamed edema, then the edema goes away

173
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:45,510
for instance if you give cortisone and then you see the symptoms are going away.

174
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:59,120
If you catch the M.S. on the process of forming the plaques, then you can reduce it and you can cure it.

175
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:09,620
But if this has been formed already, you will have this impediment, the right leg will go always like this.

176
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:17,290
You just stay, you cannot progress it further. That's what I say.

177
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:37,700
-There is a question for the situation of myoma. If you have a woman which she has bleedings from myoma

178
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:50,920
and it's still active process and you take away the organ, then it will be an obstacle after treating?

179
00:34:51,730 --> 00:35:04,580
-No. If the myoma was calcified and this calcification prevented certain functions of the body,

180
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:13,810
these functions you cannot recover. But if operated in the process of inflammation etc.

181
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:21,070
 still your remedy can act and can
 prevent a lot of things that would happen.

182
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:30,180
Let us take, not the uterus, because it's not so important, let's take the brain or the heart.

183
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:37,430
In the brain you have a tumor forming.

184
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:55,660
Then if you catch it at the process of forming, you can reduce it almost totally. If you catch a valve in the heart,

185
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:07,420
in the process of inflammation, you have an acute rheumatic fever and you have heart problems.

186
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:17,500
That means there is a valve which is inflammed and it's going to be destroyed. If you catch it during

187
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:23,260
the process of inflammation, you can cure it.
 If you catch it after the inflammation is finished

188
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:31,830
 and the damage is permanent, you
 cannot anymore overcome this problem.

189
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:36,640
The heart will remain with
an impediment.

190
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:54,000
-So I can understand that as long
as a dynamic is going on is fine.

191
00:36:55,670 --> 00:37:04,580
-No. As long as the body is alive, the dynamic process is going on in general

192
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:08,670
but in that particular point it has stopped.

193
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:22,530
All action has stopped. This is a dead part and we will see what it means in the emotional level.

194
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:40,260
A case is suffering from an undefined general weakness of the physical body. This can be an impediment.

195
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:45,940
You have a difficult case.
You have an impediment to cure.

196
00:37:48,220 --> 00:38:00,380
Somebody comes and complains of lack of energy, the main problem is lack of energy.

197
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:12,910
 That shows that there are several miasmatic blockages which do not allow the free flow

198
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:23,470
 of the vital force and the vital force cannot produce an inflammation, produce a process.

199
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:42,670
It stays under heavy pressure the organism; it never feels free. These cases you can only palliate to a certain extent.

200
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:54,880
The patient will never say, I feel great. This,
I feel great you will never hear from such cases.

201
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,880
These cases are the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome cases. These are such that will not give you a picture of a remedy.

202
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:26,860
You try and try and you give this and that remedy, no effect and the fatigue stays.

203
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:35,950
It's very interesting that they call it
Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.

204
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:44,580
The patient says, I'm chronically
fatigued and the doctor says,

205
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:48,900
 you have a Cronic Fatigue
Syndrome and everybody is happy.

206
00:39:49,000 --> 00:40:01,800
Now I have a diagnosis but we can do nothing for you. But Homeopaths also many times we can do nothing, why?

207
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:13,900
Because due to the low energy we do not have a real symptomatology. The symptoms are undefined,

208
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:30,240
non specific and the general sense
of the patient is one of chronic fatigue.

209
00:40:48,550 --> 00:41:02,100
Also this chronic fatigue syndrome is new, the last 20-30 years, a new disease. They did not know this disease,

210
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:21,940
 it was not known 50-60 years ago and then with the introduction of antibiotics into the stream, that is why

211
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:30,220
CFS is a syndrome that we see ourselves, in the western world; they don't see that syndrome

212
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:35,550
 in Africa, in South America very seldom.

213
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:45,800
Now that they are shifting the antibiotics and the cortisone and all the chemical drugs, now we're going to see such cases.

214
00:41:46,300 --> 00:42:01,720
CFS is a syndrome of the western world and most probably, not exclusively, due to use of chemical drugs.

215
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:16,830
CFS I've also seen starting from using marihuana. She said, 'after that day in which I used a bigger amount

216
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:28,120
of marihuana, I started feeling this weakness and paralysis etc.'. It can also put a person in a wheel chair

217
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:38,540
together with the mental confusion and the
emotional indifference which produces.

218
00:42:51,080 --> 00:43:10,110
We go now to blockages on the emotional level and the first blockage is what I have called, the husband syndrome.

219
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:22,430
It will go to the medical books very soon.

220
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:41,520
It is very interesting, also for me, that this
woman who has married a particular man

221
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:52,700
because they thought, this man is good for me not as a lover, not as a sexual partner

222
00:43:52,800 --> 00:44:03,390
but as a husband, that means somebody who can protect me, somebody who can give me security,

223
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:13,230
who can give me prestige, position in
the society and all this taken together,

224
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:22,510
 counteracts the fact that I am not
really interested in him, sexually.

225
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:34,600
If they make that compromise, they are going to develop that syndrome which is going to elude any Homeopath.

226
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:44,990
Any Homeopath will fall into the trap of giving remedy after remedy because the symptoms will be shifting

227
00:44:45,090 --> 00:45:01,820
from one side to another, this, that, this, you get totally confused. These are the cases that will follow you

228
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:07,070
because they understand you are their only hope.

229
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:16,930
They are not sick enough to be diagnosed as diabetes, now you have to take antidiabetic drugs,

230
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:34,310
they are not diagnosed as heart problem or this or that. They are undefined what we usually call functional

231
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:46,730
or neurovegetative symptoms. Palpitations, headaches, dizziness, one day they cannot walk, she says

232
00:45:46,830 --> 00:46:00,320
'I can't walk, what happened to me?', you give Piper methysticum. 'Ah, now I can walk but my headache'

233
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:16,660
 'Where is your headache?', 'On the right side', you give Belladonna, whatever and then the left side starts...

234
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:25,680
I should have written down, maybe I sit down and write all the symptoms that can be produced

235
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:35,300
and finally you say how are
you doing with your husband?

236
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:47,790
  Sometimes they will be even surprised with the question and they will deny it from the beginning.

237
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:56,230
 I have a very good husband, they have persuaded themselves that their husband is the best in the world.

238
00:46:56,330 --> 00:47:04,270
It's not that they really understand what is
going on. Their husband is the best!

239
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:17,350
'And how frequently you have sex?

240
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:33,610
'If I feel well, we can have'. 'How frequently you feel well, once the month, once the year?'

241
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:51,860
You get the story and the story is very clear every time. There is a transference of the aversion to the husband,

242
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:57,870
actually there is an aversion to sex. That's
all they hate, everything else they love.

243
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:11,960
 They love to discuss, to go out with him, to go socially, no problem as long as this time

244
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:22,340
 when you have to come in the bed and I have to do this, this is terrible and then the headache starts.

245
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:35,350
'Today don't talk to me' and the poor husband, almost invariably I have seen that the husband believes

246
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:51,260
  this syndrome and believes that his wife is very ill and supports her all along. They don't force the woman.

247
00:48:52,340 --> 00:49:01,590
But the woman says, 'I have to be well today, it's almost two months. Maybe he will go with another woman'

248
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:10,630
that's the idea that they may lose the husband by waiting too much, right? So they will force themselves

249
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:21,490
to do it and then again the symptoms will start.
And then there is a shifting of symptoms and you get crazy.

250
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:35,060
I have managed only very few cases to treat, at least two of my cases which I have battled for years,

251
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:40,410
ended up taking psychotropic drugs.

252
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:52,330
After treatment of 10-11 years, they
ended up taking psychotropic drugs.

253
00:49:53,320 --> 00:50:00,790
 It was not possible to handle
 the situation anymore.

254
00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:13,950
The one of these cases I have discussed it with you, I think several times, where she was vomiting,

255
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:24,750
vomiting in one night because they had set the date of marriage. They have put a date of marriage

256
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:43,110
that they agreed finally, they said, in 3rd of June we marry. The same night the woman felt so sick that she was vomiting

257
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:50,580
constantly from the morning until 11 o'clock
 when they telephoned me they said come,

258
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:58,350
we have to take her to hospital because she was vomiting constantly. I went there at 1 o'clock in the morning,

259
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:10,720
we finished with another doctor and we went there and what we found out? She was exhausted totally

260
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:21,540
 and I gave one remedy, Ipecacuanha, I gave another, until 3 o'clock I had given 10 remedies, no effect.

261
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:27,790
I said, my God I have to go to sleep also. Tomorrow I have to start seeing cases from 8 o'clock in the morning,

262
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:29,450
what shall I do?

263
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:38,570
And then suddenly the idea came to my mind. Oh my God, they must have set the date of marriage.

264
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:59,800
I said to the husband and to her mother, she was in the room, can you please go out, I want to ask her something.

265
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:11,650
She was lying there exhausted, you won't believe, she was giving you the impression she was in coma,

266
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:27,300
I said, Louisiana did you arrange
 the time of your marriage?

267
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:38,720
She opened her mouth, she said, yes.
For when?

268
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:47,660
For the 3rd of June, in one month. I said, do
you understand why you are in such a state?

269
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:55,300
In 5 minutes she was up, she said
 to her mother, make me some soup.

270
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:59,090
She ate the soup and in half an
hour we left, next day she was fine.

271
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:06,780
But this case though she knew the
problem, she understood the problem,

272
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,870
she didn't want, the insecurity was
 too much to leave the husband.

273
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:23,580
And she ended it up, I think 10 years later,
she ended up taking antidepressant drugs.

274
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:37,980
In spite of the fact they know the problem they are aware of the problem, they cannot overcome it

275
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:43,250
and it is so deep, and so it is such
an impediment
 for your treatment.

276
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:55,240
You cannot imagine because their false symptomatology, you see the organism

277
00:53:55,340 --> 00:54:01,000
out of the desire to escape, they will produce anything.

278
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:08,400
So what they produce is not a real symptom
 of an organism who works properly,

279
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:15,490
it's an organism who works under
the pressure of the emotional level.

280
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:29,300
And then you battle and in the end most
 probably you will lose the battle.

281
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:52,970
-Did you realize from experience that people
 who have been under homeopathic treatment

282
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:58,500
found the strength to get out of such a relationship?

283
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:14,350
-It can happen both, either they get out or they get their problem fixed because it's not always

284
00:55:14,450 --> 00:55:23,940
the problem of relationship. It's the problem of the person and if we have a Sepia case,

285
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:36,480
 constitutional Sepia, with strong aversion,
how to manage? Under homeopathic treatment,

286
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:46,600
 they can bring about a good relationship, especially if both are treated.

287
00:55:48,640 --> 00:56:03,220
Usually in such cases there is a very good rapport on all matters except in this sexual sphere.

288
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:08,850
In the sexual sphere you need a discussion.

289
00:56:09,850 --> 00:56:20,990
In Greek the sexual act is called genetic discussion, "genetissios omilia". Omilia is the discussion

290
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:28,240
because each one is expressing
himself to the other person.

291
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:43,990
And if this is acceptable, then we have a good match. If this is not acceptable, either you talk cacophony

292
00:56:44,090 --> 00:57:00,350
or you talk nonsense or you talk irrelevant subjects, you have sex and you're thinking of 'I went to this nice shop

293
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:12,900
and I like this ring..', in the meantime you have sex. This is not a discussion, this is going away from the real discussion,

294
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:27,140
you're thinking of something else while you're having this relationship. In such a case there maybe pathology

295
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:36,770
 and the person comes in contact with himself through Homeopathy and says, I like to have sex, finished.

296
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:54,300
Why to avoid it? She accepts she likes it. It is
not as simple as I say it because you will see

297
00:57:54,400 --> 00:58:07,940
with this woman, usually they're not impotent.
I don't know if it is the right word.

298
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:11,410
-Frigid.

299
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:21,270
-They are not frigid because if they confess to you, they will confess that they like somebody else.

300
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:31,590
That means they are not frigid. But that does not mean if they go with somebody else, they will be able to function

301
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:38,800
because they may start all over again the same story. That's why they need to be treated.

302
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:47,720
In order to see whether after all, once I am more balanced, do I like my husband or I don't like him.

303
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:50,370
Take a decision after all.

304
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:57,130
But taking a decision when she is out of the Sepia state, out of the Phosphoric acid state,

305
00:58:57,230 --> 00:58:59,710
 out of the Natrum muriaticum state.

306
00:58:59,810 --> 00:59:09,950
You see if she is on the Natrum muriaticum state fearing that she is going to be over dominated by the husband

307
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:25,760
or over riden by the force of the male, they resist. You give Natrum muriaticum, they open up, they enjoy.

308
00:59:28,290 --> 00:59:40,940
But again what you see in such cases, relapses all the time because the old fashion comes back

309
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:57,010
and again comes the insecurity and again they close up and again they are hurt, 'oh my husband was so rough yesterday,

310
00:59:57,110 --> 01:00:08,610
I don't want anymore to see him'. But they try again and again and then other symptomatology develops.

311
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:22,090
 It is like an instinctive imagination
 of the defense mechanism.

312
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:35,470
They imagine so many symptoms, you cannot anymore keep track of them, they're so much in variety.

313
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:46,440
Such cases are very very difficult to cure.

314
01:00:48,180 --> 01:01:02,240
Next we're talking on the emotional level like deep emotional insecurities.

315
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:34,570
You see here also there is the responsibility with the mothers and parents who have certain fixed ideas

316
01:01:34,670 --> 01:01:38,580
concerning man-woman relationship.

317
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:52,810
Do not ever lift your clothes in front of men, do not do that because you will become pregnant immediately.

318
01:01:52,910 --> 01:02:12,810
Now the child fixes that in the mind, another child will go to the mirror, it will look at the mirror and say, I'm so ugly.

319
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:23,300
This creates such a deep insecurity, she comes to be treated and you prescribe remedies

320
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:28,260
and you cannot get to the depth of the issue.

321
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:36,260
Neither you can overcome this insecurity, 'I'm ugly therefore I cannot have a relationship'.

322
01:02:38,970 --> 01:02:53,880
These cases are going to torment you. They are going to stick to their own fixed idea, 'I'm ugly'.

323
01:02:54,880 --> 01:03:11,170
The same can be implanted upon a child, you're ugly, you look so terrible and she comes to you

324
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:16,920
with symptomatology and you
cannot get to the depth of the problem.

325
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:37,810
Especially such cases you will see with very religious families. They put into the heads of the children

326
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:59,400
that they are sinners if they look to another man, If they think of a man. This becomes a fixed idea to the child

327
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:09,410
and the child cannot have a relationship anymore and from that point onwards depending on how many points

328
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:15,400
is sick in general, then you will have an impediment.

329
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:25,860
Even with people who are not very sick in general but because the sickness is all on the mental,

330
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:37,180
it's like putting a stone in the brain a callus in the brain which does not move with anything. You give a remedy,

331
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:46,380
you give another remedy, you discuss, the idea is fixed, it cannot get out, then you are going to have a problem.

332
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:52,720
You can go so far with such cases,
you cannot go further.

333
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:26,070
Another obstacle we have can be the inescapable family situation, a situation you cannot run away from.

334
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:56,910
A tragedy happens within a family, it is a tragedy which is inescapable, it is like karmic,

335
01:05:57,010 --> 01:06:08,660
it is there and it is going to stay the rest of the life, like having a retarded child, an autistic child.

336
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:15,790
This is a situation where nobody
 can get away from.

337
01:06:15,890 --> 01:06:27,580
 In certain cases this affects the organism in such a way, the grief is so deep, that cannot get out.

338
01:06:27,730 --> 01:06:32,790
Not all people who have retarded children are in that condition.

339
01:06:32,890 --> 01:06:40,940
On the contrary I would say some people who have retarded children, they are very much attached to them,

340
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:50,450
giving a lot of love and in spite of the fact they are very tired in looking after them, they are still very happy.

341
01:06:50,550 --> 01:07:01,480
They have no problem. But there are some others who feel it as a karmic stigma in their family.

342
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:09,990
Such cases you will have an impediment and you can treat these people and you can reach them

343
01:07:10,090 --> 01:07:14,600
up to a certain extend, no further.

344
01:07:16,370 --> 01:07:28,430
You will never make these people feel joy, you will never make them feel I have another level of health.

345
01:07:28,530 --> 01:07:38,670
They will come for their otitis, you treat, they're better, they will come for their lumbagos, they are treated,

346
01:07:38,770 --> 01:07:47,960
the lumbago is better there is no problem
 but the level remains the same.

347
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:21,800
-Would you say this inescapable family situation would also be the result when both parents are working

348
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:28,370
and the child does not have any full time relationship with the parents? The parents have enough time to

349
01:08:28,470 --> 01:08:35,220
wake up the child in the morning, put it to bed at night, both parents work throughout the week and on the weekend

350
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:41,460
the parents want go and have fun, so they leave the child with another baby sitter, so the child has no relationship

351
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:49,300
with their parents, as if they're an orphan. Would you say that is another inescapable situation?

352
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:58,940
-I would say this situation is escapable, not inescapable because if you explain to them this is the problem

353
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:08,460
 with the child they may change their attitude,
 I say in situations where it is really karmic.

354
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:13,190
The situation is there and nobody can change it.

355
01:09:13,290 --> 01:09:27,720
This creates a kind of deep grief, deep pain which is beyond the possibility to go over it.

356
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:33,130
Sinful habits.

357
01:09:44,290 --> 01:10:02,150
What they call, themselves, understand
as sinful behavior?

358
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:14,010
It may not be sinful for the general
public but for them it is sinful.

359
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:22,670
Therefore they will stay with this idea inside them.

360
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:33,220
 'I'm doing something wrong and I cannot overcome it and this, this is wrong and I cannot overcome it',

361
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:45,780
 This is not taken away by the remedy easily neither creates a situation where you will have a clear picture.

362
01:10:45,880 --> 01:11:14,360
It is like having underneath the surface, a fixed condition, like the layers are like this and there is a layer which is like this.

363
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:24,950
Much more strong, this is a background
situation for the individual where he feels

364
01:11:25,050 --> 01:11:32,460
'I'm doing that' but he doesn't tell anybody.
The individual feels 'I have this sinful situation

365
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:46,020
I'm a bad boy or a girl', this will create resistence to the treatment and you will treat and the result will come back

366
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:52,500
as constant relapse or constant changing of remedies.

367
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:05,000
-Can it be an imaginary sin?

368
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:23,100
-Yes, imaginary but based on something which has been exaggerated by imagination and it has been exaggerated

369
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:34,190
 it so much so to create this underlying,
deep, thick layer which cannot be moved.
