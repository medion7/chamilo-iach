1
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:37,070
If an organism belongs to group 3
and he has asthma is different

2
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:44,540
than an asthma case in the group 2.

3
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:55,400
This is the reason why you give a remedy in an asthma case. It's clear and it's cured.

4
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:02,520
And in another case you don't see
the remedy and you need 3,4,5 remedies

5
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:15,090
before you can cure such an asthma. And asthma in group 3 will take for a cure

6
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:24,930
it may take, depending on which level 7,8,
or 9 from 6 months to 3 years of treatment

7
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,030
before you can manage to cure an asthma.

8
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:39,410
In group 2 with one remedy the asthma is gone.

9
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:56,110
I had recently a friend who is here and she
was taking allopathic drugs for different things

10
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:02,540
and eventually she developed asthma.
I asked her how it was in the beginning?

11
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:16,520
In the beginning it was a hay fever, in spring
 time. What type of a hay fever?

12
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:27,280
It was of the type of what's called, Allium Cepa.

13
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:38,440
I said that 'if I give you the remedy'...
it was very severe the condition

14
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:45,280
and she had to take anticongestants
until she developed the asthma.

15
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:58,960
For the last 2 years she was having asthma, strong organism. You give the remedy and then

16
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:16,840
after 2 days it was severe rhinitis,
nose running etc. and then what you do?

17
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:26,290
-Wait?

18
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:41,620
-She said the asthma was there, the first day even worse, together with the running nose.

19
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,180
Then what will happen?

20
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:06,160
-If it was the correct remedy then the asthma probably will go away and the rhinitis will remain.

21
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:10,300
-So the course of action was like this:

22
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:19,280
First was the asthma, very severe asthma,
to use a few times Aerolin.

23
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:40,080
Then the third night the hay-fever was reducing and the asthma was reducing and severe

24
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:59,240
coughing kept her awake the whole night and fourth day the asthma had almost disappeared,

25
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:13,970
 the coughing was going on quite strongly.
 Then what happened?

26
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:22,280
In the meantime the hay-fever was gone.

27
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:32,320
The hay-fever appeared the first day very strongly and the third day it was gone.

28
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:46,640
The cough was remaining. What you will do?
 You will give something for the cough?

29
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:53,280
-It's easy to say no here and
when you have the patient is hard.

30
00:05:53,780 --> 00:06:01,020
-She says the whole night could not
sleep; then she took this Aerolin,

31
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:12,840
Ventolin to get a little bit more air and I waited.

32
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:25,360
The remedy I gave her was Sulphur to a woman who was very fastidious, keeping clean,

33
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:34,880
my wife knows her she is a friend of my wife,
 she is very particular in cleaning,

34
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:44,200
 cleaning herself and well-dressed and
all that. And my wife objected to Sulphur.

35
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:53,140
Sulphur to her? Because she
criticizes me, you know?

36
00:06:53,240 --> 00:07:00,640
Every time I give a remedy if she knows the person she says, wait a moment.

37
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:10,220
She is so neat, so clean, so this, so that.
What is the answer to that?

38
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:20,320
It's not an acute, it's a chronic condition,
for two years asthma was going on.

39
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:26,290
What's your answer to that when they
say: this person is so neat, so clean,

40
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:37,420
why do you prescribe Sulphur?
You cannot give me the the answer?

41
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:42,290
-She came into the diseased state of Sulphur.

42
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,620
-To the disease state?
To the pathology she means.

43
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:52,210
-Sulphur has a strong polarity.

44
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,640
-And she is not sick on the emotional level.

45
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:08,440
-Yes, who said that?
Not every remedy which we prescribe

46
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:14,680
has to have the mental-emotional picture because on mental emotional level,

47
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:26,680
 the person may be healthy. There is no need for all the Sulphur cases to be dirty or to look dirty

48
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:34,130
and to be indifferent to cleanliness.
There is no need;

49
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:40,670
if the other pathology indicates Sulphur
you can give it to a person like that.

50
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:45,580
There is no problem. Do you understand?

51
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:56,590
You expect to have the mental-emotional
 picture of Sulphur if you say that.

52
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:03,890
 It doesn't have it. On mental-emotional
she's healthy, why she should have it?

53
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:24,710
She goes like this with the coughing several days. What do you expect has happened?

54
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:37,400
What will happen? Do you wait?
 For how long you wait?

55
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,400
Most probably what is going to happen?

56
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:52,590
She is aggravated all along. Then the aggravation starts coming down with asthma

57
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:58,840
then there is the aggravation of the coughing

58
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:08,960
where the hay-fever is reduced and
you have the coughing.

59
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:19,380
This is the level we have to bring
her down. What do you do?

60
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:28,260
The hay-fever is gone, that was
originally 4-5 years ago, very severe.

61
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:36,840
It appeared very severe the first day,
 running everything,

62
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:46,580
'now I have my hay-fever as well, I have my asthma, my coughing'.

63
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:56,540
Then asthma was reducing but cough
was remaining strong.

64
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,240
I'm talking about a cough which
she could not lie down at all.

65
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:10,200
In the middle of the night she had
to walk or stay sitting the whole night.

66
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:17,650
-If the cough brings the asthma
out and the mucus out is ok.

67
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,960
-No, it was a dry cough.

68
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,180
-Then I must treat after the new symptom.

69
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:36,590
-I would have to check if the new symptoms appearing give a clear picture of the remedy.

70
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,750
 That's what I have to look for.

71
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:49,670
-Yes, this is what I did. Because she said
she was suffering a lot and it appeared to me

72
00:11:50,030 --> 00:12:02,000
that these symptoms of lying down the coughing was worse, getting up the cough was better.

73
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:09,360
 I gave a remedy which
has these characteristics, which is?

74
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:23,890
-Cactus, no.

75
00:12:33,040 --> 00:13:00,200
-Coccus Cacti. I gave Cocc-c knowing what? What did I know when I gave this remedy?

76
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,500
-Complementary?

77
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:15,190
-No, it was not complementary.
I knew that this prescription is wrong.

78
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:23,000
What I'm doing is wrong but in my
 effort to relieve the symptoms

79
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:31,990
 I thought ok to relieve the symptoms.
But then what?

80
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:38,360
Fortunately what happened?

81
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,580
-Sometimes you give such a remedy
 because otherwise the patient

82
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,650
would use some kind of cough medication.

83
00:13:51,400 --> 00:14:01,170
-Yes, she was using the cough medication
but the cough was continuing.

84
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:04,610
It was very severe cough.

85
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:08,920
So what happened fortunately?

86
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,450
-She came back to asthma?
- No.

87
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:29,080
-Probably the hay-fever and the
asthma came back?

88
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:36,170
-Fortunately no. Fortunately it did not act at all.

89
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:48,840
Did you take the remedy? Yes I took
the remedy. What happened? Nothing.

90
00:14:51,320 --> 00:15:00,240
It's not a matter of placebo here.
She has been up for 3 nights, coughing.

91
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:05,170
The fourth night you decide maybe
I have to do something.

92
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:17,130
And then I did this. I took the main characteristics of the cough and prescribed the remedy.

93
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,210
Fortunately it was totally out
and it did not do anything.

94
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,400
-I want to say that perhaps the
Coccus cacti didn't work

95
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:44,330
because the vital force has been so stimulated
that it was pushing out the pathology.

96
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:49,090
-Yes, it could not be suppressed.

97
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:59,080
That is true in one sense; on the other sense
if the remedy was close enough

98
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:06,220
would do something. It would suppress a little bit the cough with the possibility of bringing back

99
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:13,860
 the asthma of course. Now fortunately
 it didn't do anything and the cough

100
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:19,680
continued for that night and it
continued for a few more nights

101
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:29,280
but already from the second or third night
she could say, 'maybe I am a little bit better'.

102
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:36,800
Even before the Cocc-c. Then it continued
this amelioration of the coughing

103
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,080
and then the sixth or seventh day the
cough was better and then what happened?

104
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:04,600
- What would have happened if instead of giving her Cocc-c, I would have repeated Sulph?

105
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,820
-Well the answer is difficult because
we had not given Sulphur.

106
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:19,520
So what I suggest is only a suggestion,
we cannot substantiate it.

107
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:26,930
Most probably it would not have
done anything. The second possibility is,

108
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:33,540
it might have helped in case the
organism needed another dose.

109
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:40,220
The third possibility is that because the Sulphur picture is not anymore there,

110
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,160
 it could have disturbed the case.

111
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:54,210
So the best thing in this
situation is wait and observe.

112
00:17:54,440 --> 00:18:02,170
If you see even a little bit of
improvement, wait, hands off.

113
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:09,960
Actually this was a mistake,
 fortunately not a big mistake.

114
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:16,990
Otherwise you could change the
case and then you lose the thread.

115
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:23,800
Then the picture of Pulsatilla will come up and the picture of Hyoscyamus will come up,

116
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,380
you prescribe Pulsatilla, a bit better, you prescribe Hyoscyamus, a bit better and then

117
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:42,560
you mess up the case. Because we are in a hurry, in one week we must finish the case.

118
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:48,910
Seventh day she started again with hay-fever.

119
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:59,000
While this cough was reducing the
hay fever started coming up again.

120
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:15,720
Now, as I said, the picture of hay fever originally was like All-c. Would you give All-c now?

121
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:27,370
Fortunately I have told her, if I give you a
 remedy you will have back your hay fever.

122
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:35,910
So when she had the hay fever,
she knew that it was a process of cure;

123
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:39,020
so she could be more tolerant.

124
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:51,720
 Because the moment they see what you say comes true, the patient is willing to wait.

125
00:19:51,820 --> 00:20:00,480
If they don't know that this comes back,
they are so aggressive in asking medications

126
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:05,510
 that you are pushed to prescribe for the
hay fever and then that is again very

127
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:13,600
 dangerous because you may be pushing
back the whole situation into the asthma.

128
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:23,800
It's now almost a month, she is well.
She had the hay fever for a few days

129
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:35,920
and now which is the worst period
 for her, May-June she is well,

130
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:44,880
 no medication allopathic or homeopathic.
Just because we know the theory.

131
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:50,220
If we don't know the theory it is most
probable that we spoil the case.

132
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,780
I, that I know the theory,
 I could also have spoiled the case.

133
00:20:54,870 --> 00:21:01,260
That's why I excuse you when you are pressurized and say, give me a remedy.

134
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:07,180
-May I ask, did the hay-fever come back as severe as before?

135
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:16,200
-In the beginning when she described the first,
 it was worse than even before.

136
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:27,480
She said, it was terrible. 24 hrs the nose, the eyes, the itching was running and she had

137
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,150
the dyspnoia, why is this? This is interesting.

138
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:43,520
While she had the externalization with these discharges, still she was having the asthma.

139
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:58,440
So the organism needs some time because
 you say 'ah, it has aggravated the case'.

140
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:05,200
And I get sometimes people saying 'ah that was an aggravation therefore I give another remedy,

141
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:13,520
 remedy because the asthma was worse'.
It doesn't matter that the hay fever was there.

142
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:18,450
The hay fever, the asthma,
the coughing, all was worse.

143
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:26,360
The moment that you see the hay fever, wait.

144
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:36,840
The appearance of the hay fever makes you believe that the remedy is correct.

145
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:40,680
- Even when the hay fever
returned after the cough,

146
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:48,210
was it still so severe as the
first time she had the asthma?

147
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:56,960
-No, when the hay fever returned it was
milder than the original hay fever.

148
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:04,480
-Did you prescribe Sulphur after
how many days after the All-c?

149
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:10,760
-No, I never gave All-c.
When she described to me,

150
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:22,360
she gave me the impression
 that her hay fever 3 years ago was ...

151
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:35,200
-The asthma which stayed when the hay fever returned might be due to anatomical reason

152
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:41,430
because when the nose is blocked with
all this discharge and the person is breathing

153
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:46,000
 through his mouth the lower
respiratory tract is in trouble anyway,

154
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:51,220
so asthma might be part of the blocked-nose.

155
00:23:51,810 --> 00:24:02,250
-Yes but the thing is that the asthma
was worse, the coughing was worse.

156
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:09,610
You can understand this situation, she didn't sleep at all, just coughing, sitting up, walking,

157
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:16,250
nose running, it was a terrible situation.

158
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:25,960
And she was using the sprays during
the whole night. She used them 4 times.

159
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:39,630
-Could I return to the cough? If it is hard
like you told, strong for several days

160
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:55,570
 it shows up Sulph. symptoms. Could you give Sulph. lower potency like C 10, 12 for one time?

161
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:05,910
-You may give but as I said, if you give you
 have to expect either of the 3 observations

162
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,270
that I gave you; she will become
better, she will be worse or

163
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:18,180
she will be suppressed or change the picture.

164
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:25,670
-George, I have an asthma case of
somebody who developed asthma

165
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:32,120
at the age of 3 years old after measles,
just after she had the measles

166
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:39,530
she started having the asthma. This person
 is 43 and she has the asthma for 40 years;

167
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,840
the asthma is better now but
still it has to be treated.

168
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:54,770
If you start treating the asthma you will get back to the cause of this? What will happen?

169
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,080
We are not talking about hay fever,
we are talking about measles.

170
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:07,650
-If the measles were treated by a suppressive measure, that means if during the measles

171
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:19,380
she took antibiotics and due to this suppression was the asthma caused, then in the process

172
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:32,820
 you will have a similar condition like
measles reappearing and going over.

173
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:40,120
-You said she had this very hard
cough and hay fever at the same time

174
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:47,120
and eventually the cough got
lesser and the hay fever came back

175
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:53,240
 with the original symptoms.
But then there was no more asthma there.

176
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:57,500
- No asthma.
- Then it's clear.

177
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:05,440
-Excuse me, I have difficulty understanding between group 1 and group 2.

178
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:16,660
Group 1 apparently has the highest vitality.
I would therefore think that the acutes would be

179
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:24,540
 very severe as opposed to the second
group which we have less vitality?

180
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:35,800
-Yes they can be severe if you want to
say that 40 degrees of fever is severe.

181
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:42,560
But in reality it is not severe,
 it is not endangering the life.

182
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:49,000
40 degrees of fever in this group no problem.
 40 degrees in this group there is a problem.

183
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,600
40 degrees of fever in this group,
very severe problem.

184
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,610
40 degrees of fever in this
group, they will die.

185
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:09,120
-I've got one more question
referring to Cocc-c again.

186
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:17,190
My impression is if you give high dose of the correct remedy and it's acting, is it possible that

187
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:23,990
 the patient goes through states of former remedies which have been necessary?

188
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,380
-Yes it is.

189
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:35,700
-Just for some days or weeks you see Stannum or whatever and then again, it goes on working?

190
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,150
-Yes.

191
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:40,630
-Then it doesn't need it? I wait?

192
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:46,090
-We will be discussing the
reactions in different groups.

193
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:56,460
The different groups have different
evaluations and different treatment on our part.

194
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:05,120
We will be discussing because we are
in the beginning of the discussion.

195
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:27,820
-Did you understand? Severe or serious.
 Serious is more correct word.

196
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:37,620
Here the acutes are not serious. Here,
acutes even they may not appear serious,

197
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:47,660
 they are serious. That means an acute mistreated here, can lead to a chronic condition.

198
00:29:53,960 --> 00:30:02,770
I will give you examples. The case where somebody is treated with antibiotics for sinusitis.

199
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:11,090
He goes to the medical doctor, he sees
 sinusitis, inflammation and gives antibiotics.

200
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:17,640
 This inflammation goes away,
the headaches and all that go away.

201
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:25,590
After 20 days it appears again.
Again he takes another antibiotic.

202
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:34,280
After 20 days again sinusitis, he goes
again. This cases eventually will end up to us.

203
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:45,560
If you see this history you place
this person in this group here

204
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:56,500
because the organism cannot get
rid and comes back again and again.

205
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:05,900
The same condition, in this group you
will see little children with cystitis.

206
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:12,210
 Most of the children with cystitis they
will take antibiotics, they will get over it.

207
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:14,720
They belong to this group.

208
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:25,940
There are some children with otitis or cystitis, they will get some antibiotics and after a while

209
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:30,190
the otitis is back, the cystitis is back;
 then again antibiotics.

210
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:41,090
And then you realize that the
organism is going down and down.

211
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:44,900
The parents are usually worrying,
where this situation goes.

212
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,840
Almost he takes constantly antibiotics
and still nothing happens.

213
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:55,430
In the meantime changes on the mental-emotional level start where the child

214
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:08,210
shows disturbances. He
becomes restless, anorectic.

215
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:19,320
These are the cases that will come to us.
 These children do not belong to the first group.

216
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:29,440
You may have, in treating a cystitis, to take
 much longer period, in treating the cystitis or

217
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:39,520
 treating the whole person of course, you take much longer time than if it was on the first group.

218
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:46,140
You will give a remedy and there is a relapse,
 not in one month as it was before but

219
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:52,730
the relapse comes after 3 months. Then
you see the picture of the cystitis is not exactly

220
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:59,410
as it was before and you need to
 change remedy. You give a second remedy.

221
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:09,260
-In this case the development of the first
 reaction seems very good development.

222
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:15,060
I don't understand why shall we change the remedy or think about something else because

223
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:21,360
 from asthma to hay fever and then
 to cough is a very good development.

224
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:29,170
And I think when it is so severe this cough maybe we can try another high potency for

225
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:36,500
example but not go away
from the right development.

226
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:47,360
-Wait a moment because we will take step by step to see what happens and to evaluate

227
00:33:47,980 --> 00:34:08,740
in each group what happens if the acute after
1-3 days immediately after the remedy develop.

228
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:21,640
 Then the other possibility is after a week,
after 7 days, so there is some lapse of time

229
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:40,680
 of 7 days and then they develop
the acute. Or there is after 1 month.

230
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:52,260
Some periods of time, just an indication.
The ideas have to be understood;

231
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:59,350
 it doesn't mean after 3 years exactly,
it can be 2,5 years or 1 year and 3 months.

232
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:07,280
Just as an indication I take these periods of
 time to analyze the reaction of the organism

233
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:18,880
after the chronic case has been treated
by a remedy for his chronic condition.

234
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:39,960
I go to the first group. If you don't follow something and you don't put a question,

235
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:47,000
you stay with a block there which is empty. Forget it, you will not be able to follow up.

236
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:57,820
 You have to ask. It is much better if we clarify because somebody may have a question

237
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:03,770
and the other one says, oh my god I never thought of that and I also have this question.

238
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:09,500
 It is important that we clarify all the
questions before we go further.

239
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:18,680
 It is a complicated issue, I told you from the beginning, and we have to understand it

240
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:23,320
very well if we want to do serious Homeopathy.

241
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:34,190
-In America besides indulging in kinky sex,
we have little tolerance for pain.

242
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:46,800
Often medication is given because the patient can't tolerate it and frequently the pediatric care

243
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:53,580
 with children, parents will give medication while the child can tolerate the pain. But parents can't

244
00:36:53,650 --> 00:37:00,600
tolerate the child's discomfort and
so they give allopathic medication to ease

245
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:06,450
some of the suffering. To what degree in the terms of the case that you just mentioned,

246
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:16,710
does the Ventolin interfere with the action
 of the Sulphur and can we assess that

247
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:20,180
so it may be necessary to
give additional remedies?

248
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:25,520
-You see for the cases we are discussing,
this allopathic medication is in any case

249
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:31,680
a palliative treatment;
 it's not a curative treatment.

250
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:35,600
So therefore will palliate for a
certain period of time

251
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:42,660
 The Ventolin will make the person able
to breath for 1 or 2 hours, whatever

252
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,320
and then the whole condition
comes back. So therefore,

253
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:57,030
 I would prefer this palliative way of
treatment during the initial aggravation than

254
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:08,460
me interfering with homeopathic remedies.
I would prefer that if it is not possible to

255
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:17,360
withstand the pain or the dyspnoea
or whatever that the palliative should

256
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:24,180
be given, a chemical palliative, instead
of a potency, instead of a high potency.

257
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:42,240
-Does the palliative ever interfere with the
 action of the remedy and in those cases

258
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:45,970
 is it necessary then to reassess the remedy?

259
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:51,830
-I understand. There is a possibility
 that the palliative may interfere

260
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:57,640
but it will interfere less
than a homeopathic remedy.

261
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:08,810
Most probably, if it is used
wisely and not aggressively,

262
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:15,620
 it is most probable that it will not interfere.

263
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:20,700
- I always understood there is a difference between an acute and an aggravation.

264
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:28,080
Now at the moment I get the impression that it is confused and I would like to have this clarified.

265
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:42,030
-Very good. When we talk of an acute in this condition, we are talking of acute conditions,

266
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:56,220
not acute exacerbations of chronic condition.
Today we are talking about acute conditions

267
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:10,920
 but as we go along we have to mention
the acute exacerbation of the cases as well.

268
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:22,970
For instance in the case I mention to you,
there is no acute disease going on.

269
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:34,790
There is an acute exacerbation etc.
If this case later on, let us say in 2-3 months,

270
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:45,230
 gets an acute, that means an influenza, a common cold, a cystitis, I have to evaluate

271
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:51,040
that acute in conjunction with the
acutes she used to have.

272
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:58,150
 I have to evaluate why she
developed this acute now.

273
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:04,340
To what group she belongs and
why she developed the acute.

274
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,780
Let's go to the first observation,
 1-3 days immediately.

275
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:20,040
You have a case of lumbago,
you treated here and you gave Calc.

276
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:27,330
And the next day or the day after he
 telephones you and tells you: 'I have a cold'.

277
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:36,010
'What do you have?', 'I have some f
ever, my nose is running' and bla, bla, bla.

278
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:47,700
What is your evaluation for that situation?
The first thing that you have to think.

279
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:56,600
You have to ask yourself
several questions first.

280
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:03,390
You have given Calc., a deep remedy
and he says now he has a cold

281
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:11,640
and the cold is Ars. or type of Ars.
Are you going to give it?

282
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:16,800
<i>- No.</i>
<i>- Why not?</i>

283
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:23,720
The why you don't give it is
 important because if you understand

284
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:27,880
the why then you do the correct thing.

285
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:36,320
-Normally in the acute you see the remedy. Actually when you have an acute,

286
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:45,920
normally if you see an acute, you can see
the remedy in the acute because everything

287
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:51,960
 comes up so nicely.
So why to give Arsenicum here?

288
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,160
-So, what do you give?

289
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:57,000
-I would give nothing.

290
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:07,430
-In this situation I would always consider a process of discharging as amelioration.

291
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:11,350
If the person discharges I would
 take it as an amelioration.

292
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:19,010
-As amelioration, yes. Next?

293
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:31,730
-If the cold is not life threatening?
You can wait and see what happens.

294
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:46,530
-Yes but nobody gave the correct
answer so far. Try something else.

295
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,480
-Lumbago becoming better?

296
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:57,410
-In the first 2 days you do not know.

297
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:10,720
-The lumbago is on a higher physical level than the secretion from the mucus membranes.

298
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:16,530
So if you have the secretion or some process on a lower level is not as dangerous.

299
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:24,340
-You have to be very careful because such questions will be put during examinations and

300
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:37,500
if you don't answer these questions I'm afraid you have a problem. The correct answer is this:

301
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:45,940
That this group of people have strong
 organism, they get acutes sometimes.

302
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:50,150
This time they got an acute
 immediately after your remedy.

303
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:56,760
What your remedy should have
done in case it was correct?

304
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:23,400
It should have prevented the person from
 having a cold. First, this is general idea.

305
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:35,310
The second thing: I gave Calc and today
he has a cold. The cold most probably was

306
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:44,760
preparing from the day before when
he came already to my consulting room.

307
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:57,650
You gave the remedy, he gets the cold.
Then you have a cold which is starting

308
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:03,680
before your remedy and it's developing
during the action of your remedy.

309
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:19,820
Then what is your evaluation? The first evaluation is that the remedy is incorrect

310
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,200
because it allows the cold
to develop immediately.

311
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:28,770
Therefore it is incorrect, the first thought.

312
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:35,110
 The second thought is: if the cold was developing from the previous day

313
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:43,750
and now it's going to continue for a few
more days what you have to do?

314
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:50,980
-I think if the remedy was correct the cold would end sooner than it would have done normally.

315
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:54,840
-Very good. Again this small one is correct.

316
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:04,100
If the remedy is correct then what you
have to do is ask this man or woman.

317
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:16,810
'When you get usually a cold is this cold the same as this time or this time is very mild?'

318
00:47:16,825 --> 00:47:25,010
 If the answer is, 'the same', mathematically
 your prescription was wrong

319
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:32,320
or the remedy was not well potentised
 or not potentised at all.

320
00:47:32,405 --> 00:47:37,320
You gave a remedy that's nothing.

321
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:44,720
If the cold is the same as usual
it is as if you have not given a remedy.

322
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:52,310
But if he describes this time
his cold is much milder, he will say,

323
00:47:53,400 --> 00:48:01,910
 'well usually it is by that time it
 would have gone down my throat

324
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:11,880
 and now it has only stayed in my nose'. Immediately you wait, don't prescribe.

325
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:19,380
The chronic remedy which you are giving,
is acting and it will take eventually away

326
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:27,980
the lumbago and it will take
 away the cold as well.

327
00:48:28,065 --> 00:48:35,280
Clear. But to be clear you have to ask
the right questions to the patient.

328
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:42,600
Your cold was the same
as before or is it better?

329
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:50,685
This is crucial. This type of things
they have to become automatic almost

330
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:57,960
because all this is dealt on the telephone.
The patient is not going to come to your

331
00:48:58,015 --> 00:49:03,740
 consulting room giving you all this. So you
are busy with a new patient, you get a

332
00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:09,200
telephone call and you have to know
exactly what to ask and what to decide.

333
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:28,480
We go to the same group of people
 but the cold develops 7 days after.

334
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:36,720
What are the questions that you have to ask and the information you have to get for this condition?

335
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:41,600
-One more question concerning this cold.
In the case we were talking before,

336
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:45,100
the asthma with the hay fever,
there it was a chronic treatment.

337
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:50,240
In the beginning the hay fever reappeared stronger than it had ever been before

338
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:53,640
but the remedy was correct.

339
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:58,540
In this case now we have somebody who develops a cold which is worse and

340
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:03,380
assuming that it's worse than before.
This would mean that the remedy was wrong.

341
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:09,960
So do I differentiate between reoccurring of
old symptoms in a chronic case and acutes?

342
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:21,110
-Yes because on the first case with Sulph, we are treating asthma with cough and then appears....

343
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:30,320
In this case we are treating a lumbago,
during which treatment appears a cold.

344
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:40,800
It's not an aggravation of the lumbago, it is not
an aggravation of the situation which we treat.

345
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:46,640
 We treat asthma, asthma is aggravated.
We treat lumbago, lumbago is aggravated.

346
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:59,560
I will give you, if we have time in this course,
if we don't have time in the next course,

347
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:07,210
I will give you the possible reactions of the organism under the homeopathic remedy.

348
00:51:07,725 --> 00:51:15,020
 What we are dealing with now is acute conditions different from what you are treating.

349
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:18,900
You are treating epilepsy
and you have a bronchitis.

350
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:28,530
You are treating rheumatoid arthritis and you have development of cystitis.

351
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:35,080
You are treating sleeplessness
and you develop severe cystitis.

352
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:48,875
It is not the condition for which you are treating is aggravated. We are talking mostly about acute.

353
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:59,250
 But it may happen, it's a little bit of
confusion when you treat hay fever

354
00:51:59,335 --> 00:52:02,320
which looks like a cold. Hay fever
is not like having common cold.

355
00:52:06,575 --> 00:52:10,235
and when you treat a hay fever and
there is an aggravation of the hay fever

356
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:17,020
it's different than developing
an influenza or a cold.

357
00:52:17,105 --> 00:52:26,095
So we go back to the condition where we
treat a sciatica or lumbago and 7 days

358
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:35,980
after your Calc develops his common cold.
What he knows to be a common cold.

359
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:41,080
 What does that mean automatically?
What do you think?

360
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:47,040
-The remedy is wrong.

361
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:59,470
-Correct. Immediately assume that the remedy was wrong because the remedy is given

362
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:10,390
some time to act; therefore it should have prevented the appearance of the cold.

363
00:53:11,495 --> 00:53:16,580
 This is almost a sure sign that
your remedy was wrong.

364
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:24,420
-But you also have the reappearance of
old symptoms and almost every patient

365
00:53:24,505 --> 00:53:33,455
has sometimes a common cold. So you have
to differentiate if this is the appearance of

366
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:39,660
 former symptoms or if this is a real acute?
 How do you do this?

367
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:47,680
-Ok, I will explain very good. We say, we
have the reappearance of an old symptom

368
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:55,150
if there is a sequence. That means
a bronchitis has been suppressed

369
00:53:55,170 --> 00:54:00,100
 and then there is asthma and
then there is suppressed and then

370
00:54:00,165 --> 00:54:06,910
there is depression and there is a historical following of one condition after another.

371
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:16,900
 Here in this group we don't have that
 sequence. We have somebody who is

372
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:24,210
getting his lumbagos from time to time
and his colds from time to time.

373
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:32,550
So there is no connection between lumbago
 and cold. Not because he had a cold last year

374
00:54:32,595 --> 00:54:38,970
 that now has the lumbago. If that was the connection, that's a different story

375
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:46,480
but here we don't have that case. Later on
we'll see. We have this in the lower groups.

376
00:54:50,640 --> 00:55:00,855
So 7 days after you gave the remedy,
 he has a cold and it is very improbable

377
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:08,690
that this will have the same reaction as this.

378
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:18,520
I said for this cold here that was immediately after, that the cold was developing before

379
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:24,580
your remedy. That is why it will
appear but in a milder degree.

380
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:36,225
Here having given for 7 days your remedy
for a cold to appear is almost a sure sign.

381
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:50,760
Therefore we don't treat in case it is milder.
We can treat in case it is the same.

382
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:55,700
Here, we have two possibilities. Shall we
treat or not treat? This is the question.

383
00:55:56,300 --> 00:56:07,540
Where on this group the cold is developing immediately after, it is milder than usual,

384
00:56:07,585 --> 00:56:10,360
treat or not treat?

385
00:56:12,130 --> 00:56:14,330
-Not treat.

386
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:19,785
-It is the same. Treat or not treat?

387
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:27,090
Treat. You can treat, it is as if you
have not given any remedy so far.

388
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:35,700
Here, 7 days later, he develops a
bronchitis. Treat or not treat?

389
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:38,610
-Treat.

390
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:46,800
- First of all I know my remedy has not acted, secondly I know I can treat because

391
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:53,430
it is an acute, I can treat it as an acute and
next time trying to find the correct remedy

392
00:56:53,465 --> 00:56:59,380
 for that person. It doesn't matter what
excuses we tell to the patient.

393
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:06,040
We have to know ourselves what we are doing.

394
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:13,530
We know that the remedy we gave to
 that person was incorrect, it was wrong.

395
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:25,370
-What should we assume if in a case where we have given a remedy and within the first 3 days

396
00:57:25,645 --> 00:57:31,275
this person develops an acute disease
which he has never had before?

397
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:37,660
Then in this case we can't ask is it worse,
is it the same, is it less than it used to be?

398
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:40,860
How do I make an assessment there?

399
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:44,125
-If that is the case then you
immediately have to treat.

400
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:51,350
You assume that if the person under constitutional remedy, develops an acute

401
00:57:51,435 --> 00:57:59,720
 even a new acute, does not have an
effect from the constitutional remedy.

402
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:09,830
-But if the lumbago has ameliorated after
3 or 4 days and the patient then develops

403
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:14,380
a bronchitis in the 7th day, what then?

404
00:58:14,970 --> 00:58:22,475
-Well that cannot be the case but if that
is the case, you wait. I mean it's obvious,

405
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:31,840
you understand that. This will not happen but
if it does happen, that means you have to wait

406
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:47,140
 and also, to be more exact, there might be
an immediate amelioration of the lumbago.

407
00:58:48,660 --> 00:59:02,120
Not well, better 30-40%, by 7th day his
 lumbago is 40% better and develops an acute,

408
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:11,400
again points to the fact that the remedy was wrong. The remedy was simply acting on a

409
00:59:11,485 --> 00:59:23,900
 superficial level and suppressing the organism and then develops more easily the cold.

410
00:59:25,010 --> 00:59:37,155
But if by chance you had an initial aggravation the first 2 days and the 3rd day is 40% better,

411
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:49,430
then the 5th day is 60% better, then this
will never happen. If it does happen,

412
00:59:54,130 --> 01:00:08,500
then you still wait, you don't give. In these
cases the amelioration is impressive and quick.

413
01:00:08,530 --> 01:00:15,590
So in 7 days you know what has
happened but with the wrong remedy

414
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:21,390
let us say, you have given for the
lumbago Rhus-t where he needs Calc

415
01:00:21,810 --> 01:00:28,430
or the opposite and you see some
 amelioration, 'yes I feel better', but the cold

416
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:37,570
 develops, be sure that the remedy
 was incorrect, search for another remedy.

417
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:53,240
Concentrate now on this first group
of people. Don't mix the other groups

418
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:58,895
because we have totally different
observations there.

419
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:04,310
-For instance, it could be two
different things as I understand.

420
01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:09,565
You can give a remedy which is
completely far away and by chance

421
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:16,390
he got some acute disease, it could be this way. And it could be also that you give a remedy

422
01:01:16,450 --> 01:01:20,780
which is close and then the acute comes.

423
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:26,650
-Yes, both cases indicate that
the remedy was incorrect.

424
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:41,430
-I'm sorry because you made a distinction between the lumbago getting better 40%

425
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:47,960
with or without an aggravation. But if you have the right remedy and exactly the right potency,

426
01:01:48,045 --> 01:01:53,570
 could you or not have the aggravation?
Do you always have an aggravation?

427
01:01:53,960 --> 01:02:05,520
-In this group if you have correct remedy,
 correct potency, in 7 days you have a cure.

428
01:02:09,490 --> 01:02:20,240
If during that time you have a cure and then you have a development I say it is almost impossible.

429
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:32,270
I don't want to say absolutely impossible
but almost impossible.

430
01:02:33,270 --> 01:02:38,690
-Is it possible that the constitutional remedy doesn't act just because there is acute condition

431
01:02:38,770 --> 01:02:46,330
in process? I mean first to third day there
is an acute condition that has started

432
01:02:46,355 --> 01:02:51,730
 before that and by the time the patient
 takes the constitutional remedy, there is

433
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:56,140
an acute condition in process that
indicates another remedy.

434
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:04,920
-Yes, that is the case in which we say the
acute starts 1-3 days after the remedy.

435
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:13,490
The acute was starting before your remedy and you give the remedy and the third day you see

436
01:03:13,570 --> 01:03:21,850
 the development of the acute. In such a case you have to evaluate and say, the acute is like

437
01:03:21,870 --> 01:03:33,520
usual or is less? It's milder, then you wait. It's the same as before, your remedy is not correct,

438
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:43,760
you can treat. In this case if you have
the appearance after 7-20 days,

439
01:03:45,105 --> 01:03:49,640
the remedy was incorrect.

440
01:03:56,280 --> 01:04:01,520
-I meant the constitutional remedy
is correct but it doesn't act just because

441
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:06,070
there is another remedy at present
by the time the patient takes it?

442
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:17,100
-No, there is no such case.
If the remedy for the chronic condition

443
01:04:17,310 --> 01:04:24,820
is correct then it will not develop
an acute after several days.

444
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:37,200
But let us say, you have one month
 of observation,  after a month,

445
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:43,600
 he comes to the office and says,
'I have a cold'.

446
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:54,780
Usually we wait for 1 month of observation and after a month he comes and he has a cold.

447
01:04:57,700 --> 01:05:01,990
Then what you have to
investigate in such case?

448
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:10,440
There is one more factor
that enters into the picture.

449
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:18,860
-You have to ask whether the
remedy might have been antidoted.

450
01:05:22,850 --> 01:05:26,680
-The first question we have to
ask is how is your lumbago?

451
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:30,430
-Very good.

452
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:45,360
-Or perhaps there was another stress on the patient's life that has brought on this situation.

453
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:57,410
-Very good, yes. You see now the answers you are giving are within the corect context.

454
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:05,280
The only thing is that we have to put
them all together and understand.

455
01:06:10,830 --> 01:06:20,090
<i>Ok after a month you have time for </i>
<i>observation and his lumbago in this case</i>

456
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:28,450
in this case you expect to be
cured, to be much better.

457
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:47,160
Now he says 'the lumbago is better but I have developed this cold', what you will say?

458
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:50,550
You will treat or not treat?

459
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:57,210
-Check the well-being, how he is mentally.
 How is the general well-being.

460
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:07,980
-General is better, lumbago is better.
The person is better and he has an acute.

461
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:14,470
-I would not treat.

462
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:49,970
-If this acute is strong, is an acute with high fever as usual or even worse, treat or not treat?

463
01:07:52,210 --> 01:07:55,415
-When the disease has the same
strength as usual,

464
01:07:55,500 --> 01:08:02,765
I would treat him because
then the remedy is wrong.

465
01:08:02,850 --> 01:08:11,640
-The remedy cannot be wrong if he is better.
 We assume that the remedy is correct

466
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:18,420
but he has developed an acute in one month.

467
01:08:18,550 --> 01:08:27,995
It is not usual; in a month after the correct treatment that he will have an acute.

468
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:35,130
It is not usual. People will remain for
a long period of time without an acute

469
01:08:35,635 --> 01:08:40,740
 under the correct remedy if they
belong to these groups.

470
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:46,310
That is the idea, that is
why we have a problem.

471
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:58,280
This person should not have developed an acute since the remedy was correct and has acted.

472
01:08:58,730 --> 01:09:04,520
We don't go to the possibility of the person being the same with his lumbago after a month,

473
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:09,390
I don't even examine. If the person
after a month comes and say,

474
01:09:09,435 --> 01:09:17,130
'my lumbago is the same but I have an acute',
you treat the acute, no question.

475
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:26,460
The question will rise if the person says,
'I'm better all this time from my lumbago and

476
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:35,960
I have an acute', then you have to understand this acute and take decision at the moment.

477
01:09:40,660 --> 01:09:46,940
-I was going to say to look at the symptoms
 and see if there is another remedy coming up.

478
01:09:48,930 --> 01:10:02,830
-Yes you'll look at the symptoms in any case but what I ask you to think is the theory behind it.

479
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:08,570
This person I treated, he was doing
so well but now he develops an acute.

480
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:13,710
You thought he is in level 1
but he is not in level 1.

481
01:10:13,795 --> 01:10:20,880
I assume that this is level 1,
he was good for one month,

482
01:10:21,230 --> 01:10:28,560
now he has developed an acute.
You gave the answer.

483
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:38,330
The first thing that you have to know is
whether this person by taking your remedy

484
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:49,530
has continued to take his coffee. After
a month it is possible even under correct

485
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:56,630
 homeopathic treatment to have the organism coming down and come back to the

486
01:10:57,170 --> 01:11:06,380
condition as before. That is one.
He went to the dentist? It is possible.

487
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:10,900
He took coffee? It is possible.
He took antibiotics?

488
01:11:10,985 --> 01:11:18,310
I had somebody who was bitten by a
wasp and it was swollen and was given

489
01:11:18,410 --> 01:11:26,515
antihistamine drugs so this
condition developed.

490
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:32,470
The first thing you're asking, did he do
anything to antidote your treatment

491
01:11:32,540 --> 01:11:39,520
to bring down the organism
so it could develop again the acute.

492
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:44,940
That is the one possibility
that you have to investigate.

493
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:49,560
-But if he had antidoted he wouldn't have
the lumbago come back immediately?

494
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:59,600
-No, it can be antidoted and not having the lumbago back. He's going to get the lumbago

495
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:10,620
after a particular movement he does, he goes and picks up something but not that time.

496
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:22,160
That time you have the indication of the acute and you have to say what is going on?

497
01:12:22,245 --> 01:12:31,540
My treatment was correct but he has developed
an acute? Something he has done to bring

498
01:12:31,545 --> 01:12:38,800
 down his organism, what? Dentist, coffee, antibiotics? No, no, no.

499
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:48,760
Then there is a possibility of a stress
on the mental or emotional level.

500
01:12:49,730 --> 01:12:55,350
A strong stress on mental-emotional
level can bring down

501
01:12:55,400 --> 01:13:01,540
the organism to the point
where it was before the treatment.

502
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:31,120
Then you decided, there is a stress, medicine or mental stress that brought back the condition

503
01:13:33,090 --> 01:13:40,010
but you don't have the lumbago,
 it comes with acute.

504
01:13:40,110 --> 01:13:47,680
The question therefore is ok you decided
there is an antidotal influence.

505
01:13:47,765 --> 01:13:57,010
Are you going to give the same
remedy for the cold,

506
01:13:57,110 --> 01:14:03,880
that you gave for the lumbago
or you give another remedy

507
01:14:03,910 --> 01:14:09,725
according to the acute condition?

508
01:14:09,810 --> 01:14:15,050
-Of course I have to look at the acute disease and the symptoms but if I would have

509
01:14:15,670 --> 01:14:18,915
a complementary remedy I would have
 the tendency to take a complementary

510
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:22,360
remedy in this case.

511
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:35,810
-Another one? Think.

512
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:45,200
-First you can try the same one to see if it works and if it doesn't work you can try another one.

513
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:50,890
-Give the same.

514
01:14:52,840 --> 01:15:02,860
-You could see and wait if the remedy recovers.

515
01:15:06,510 --> 01:15:18,990
-You must see if he recovers from
 the acute without any remedy?

516
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:30,340
Now this is obvious I don't want to
repeat again and again certain things

517
01:15:30,580 --> 01:15:36,400
I consider as obvious.
What is obvious here?

518
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:43,220
 If he is better here in his lumbago
and he has an acute,

519
01:15:43,305 --> 01:15:48,960
 if the acute is mild, forget it, don't treat.

520
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:55,560
If the acute is strong and you
see an antidotal influence

521
01:15:55,660 --> 01:16:04,170
you expect that you have a relapse
influence due to the antidotal influence.

522
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:09,640
Then what you do? You repeat the
same remedy, as you gave

523
01:16:09,745 --> 01:16:20,340
 to the lumbago for the acute or you
take the acute and you treat the acute?

524
01:16:22,310 --> 01:16:26,530
You see you have to have the policy
in your mind quite clear

525
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:31,320
because if you start thinking all
these things by the time he is

526
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:43,300
phoning you, you lost it. These ideas
have to come almost automatically;

527
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:52,090
it's like you have a computer inside your brain.

528
01:17:03,970 --> 01:17:09,670
-I think if the remedy is antidoted
and there is an acute case,

529
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:15,115
I have to look if there is a clear picture
of another remedy and I have to give it.

530
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:31,640
-You have to give it, ok. Here in this condition, matters are very very difficult to decide.

531
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:43,480
Do you know why? Because
you don't have enough time for

532
01:17:43,485 --> 01:17:52,210
 observation and actually you do not know exactly what happened. That means you know

533
01:17:52,480 --> 01:18:08,760
there is an antidotal influence. Does that antidotal influence is 100% or is it partial?

534
01:18:10,540 --> 01:18:17,810
If it is 100% and you are sure that the
 organism is exactly in the same state

535
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:26,700
 but you don't have time for observation, you
 will not be able to find details to know that.

536
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:36,750
If you know it is 100% then most probably
the remedy that you gave in the beginning,

537
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:57,340
will act for the acute condition. But if this
is due to a partial dropping of the organism,

538
01:18:57,405 --> 01:19:04,500
 not a complete relapse, then most
 probably you will need another remedy

539
01:19:04,605 --> 01:19:12,270
which will be indicated by the
specific symptoms of the acute.

540
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:22,000
-But how do we know if this is total or partial relapse? We only know this from symptoms.

541
01:19:22,430 --> 01:19:29,910
-Yes, that is why I said because we
cannot know, it is 1 month only

542
01:19:30,090 --> 01:19:34,200
and you don't have enough
time for observation.

543
01:19:35,310 --> 01:19:43,720
That is why it is difficult when
that situation happens to your cases

544
01:19:44,740 --> 01:19:54,700
and of course the best is to try not to give
any remedy and see what happens.

545
01:19:55,220 --> 01:20:04,200
Then what might happen is this. The acute
will further deteriorate the organism

546
01:20:04,910 --> 01:20:17,340
and eventually will bring him to a total relapse and then you can repeat the original remedy.

547
01:20:19,825 --> 01:20:31,800
 Trying to treat here in this situation is quite dangerous because most probably you don't

548
01:20:31,940 --> 01:20:41,600
have a clear acute remedy, you repeat the constitutional remedy and it doesn't act,

549
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:50,360
then you give another and it does not act and you are ending eventually treating this acute

550
01:20:50,700 --> 01:21:02,200
with 3-5 remedies. Then the case
starts being confused.

551
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:12,480
That is why I'm really upset when I have
given a correct remedy and people say,

552
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:19,310
'I drank coffee, I took this', they take
it lightly. Because then I have to do

553
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:25,395
10 times more work to understand
what is going on now what shall I do.

554
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:35,420
In the meantime you wait in the class....
but what I know,

555
01:21:35,660 --> 01:21:40,480
things that I have not told you so far,
now you know how my mind goes.

556
01:21:40,670 --> 01:21:48,730
I say what shall I do now? There is no total relapse. He says, 'I still have this and that

557
01:21:48,790 --> 01:21:53,570
but I don't have this and that
particular symptom is missing, and now

558
01:21:53,690 --> 01:21:58,500
I'm developing a cold' and I say, 'my god'.

559
01:21:58,585 --> 01:22:15,990
Most of the cases we are not satisfied with,
are these cases that could be beautiful

560
01:22:16,070 --> 01:22:21,070
and they are spoiled by antidotes
 which are interfering in the treatment

561
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:25,840
 in the early stages of treatment.

562
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:32,040
-How is the situation if I have the patient
with acute after one month

563
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:36,900
and I know the patient has
been vaccinated and this acute

564
01:22:37,060 --> 01:22:42,160
is appearing now after 6
days after he got the vaccination?

565
01:22:42,630 --> 01:22:51,380
-It is a sure sign that you have
an antidotal influence.

566
01:22:53,980 --> 01:23:01,160
Vaccinations many times will antidote
the action of the homeopathic remedy

567
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:07,530
many times and you have
relapses after the vaccination.

568
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:11,480
-What is your opinion about if you
have the impression that the remedy

569
01:23:11,530 --> 01:23:14,920
is not totally destroyed by
the antidote that you push

570
01:23:14,940 --> 01:23:27,860
on the remedy by giving a C12
 of the same remedy?

571
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:51,780
-Well we have tried this and
usually does not work.

572
01:23:55,730 --> 01:24:09,850
With partial relapse giving
a 12 usually does not give an effect.

573
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:17,870
Sometimes it gives an effect but then you
 say, most probably it was a full relapse.
