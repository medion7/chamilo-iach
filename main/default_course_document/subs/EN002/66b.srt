1
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:46,610
You see the ideas of Hahnemann concerning the miasms were correct. There is no question about that.

2
00:00:48,110 --> 00:01:03,360
The only difference is that they are not complete. That means we may not have only 3 miasms,

3
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:10,370
as Hahnemann said, but we may
have more than one miasm.

4
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:30,060
I consider the tubercular miasm as a miasm in itself. I will give you the general characteristics of a miasm.

5
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:43,520
In order to have a miasm you have to have an infective agent whether it's Syphilis, it's Gonorrhea, an infective agent.

6
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:51,300
That means an agent that can be infecting one another.

7
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,850
That is the first condition.

8
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:11,490
The second condition is that you have to have the evidence that such a condition, infective condition,

9
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:24,270
when it is treated or not treated it leaves some
after effects. It leaves problems with the health.

10
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:44,640
The third condition in order to have a miasm is to have proof that this infective agent that was infected

11
00:02:45,810 --> 00:03:06,510
the primary organism is passing to his offsprings, a predisposition which is similar to the original infection.

12
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:19,860
So three conditions are necessary.
First you have to have an infective agent.

13
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,300
 Second you have to have the evidence that this infective agent does not necessarily goes away after treatment,

14
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:43,540
 that means leaves after effects, and the third condition is that such infective agent,

15
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:45,540
such disease can pass to the next generations.

16
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:59,730
This I have said several times but still my students, like everyone wants to bring

17
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:03,260
a new idea and bring a lot of miasms now.

18
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:12,350
Unless the three conditions are there you cannot be talking about a miasm. In cancer there is an infective agent.

19
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:37,640
Can anybody be infected with cancer? Therefore cancer cannot be considered as a miasm,

20
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,540
 it is different the predisposition that
can come from different diseases.

21
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:45,380
Predisposition, I had psoriasis.
Psoriasis is infective? No.

22
00:04:46,640 --> 00:05:01,300
Nobody can be infected with psoriasis. Yet
when the mother or the father had psoriasis,

23
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,800
there is a huge probability that the
child will develop psoriasis.

24
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:17,790
That is not a miasm with the idea of a miasm. The idea of the miasm has to have an infective agent.

25
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:30,420
When Hahnemann was talking about "psora" he means about scabies. Can scabies infect each other? Yes.

26
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,120
Can scabies, when they are treated,
have side effects? Yes.

27
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:47,610
When they're passing through
to next generations? Yes.

28
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:59,600
The problem is that unless we have some principles, some understanding of what is a miasm,

29
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,860
 then we cannot be talking about miasms in general. You see, everything is a miasm.

30
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:19,870
A cortisone miasm, penicillin miasm, God knows, everything can become a miasm because all diseases

31
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:34,090
that we have in this generation, all chronic conditions are coming from our parents who were having some problems

32
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:42,850
and they pass it to offsprings. So all diseases
are hereditary. The idea of a miasm is different.

33
00:06:44,850 --> 00:07:07,360
The idea of the miasm is something which,
as I said, has to have a starting point and

34
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,990
can be infecting primary the organism.

35
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:24,040
Syphilis yes, Gonorrhea yes, Psora yes, Tuberculosis yes. Why we say Tuberculosis can be a miasm?

36
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:43,450
Because we see a person who had Tuberculosis, he develops a kind of sensitivity upon his lungs

37
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:58,110
or gets easily an acute frequent colds etc. He has children and the child is born with sensitivity towards the lungs

38
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:08,880
 and then from the very young age the boy or the girl start having infections, lung infections, respiratory infections.

39
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:23,360
You inquire whether your mother had Tuberculosis and he says, yes the mother had Tuberculosis

40
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:39,350
or the grand father had Tuberculosis. Then you give Tuberculinum and the predisposition is gone.

41
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:51,510
All this story together makes for a miasm.

42
00:08:51,610 --> 00:09:11,350
Now I will talk about the miasm with sycosis. You see from the very first observations I had made concerning

43
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:23,390
 this disease and this miasm, it was when patients were coming and I was inquiring, did you have a Gonorrhea?

44
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:34,900
 They said, yes. What age? 20-22 etc. Ok, how did you get it? We went to a prostitute. Who went to the prostitute?

45
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:47,150
We were five. And you went all to the same woman? Then what happened?

46
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:54,150
Two of us got the gonorrhea, the other three were free.

47
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,690
What protected them?

48
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:06,150
Unless you inquire you cannot find out really?

49
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:17,480
To solve this problem it needs long periods of observation in order to come to a conclusion

50
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,490
what actually is happening and why one is protected and the other gets it immediately.

51
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:43,100
When I was in United States, in 1983-85, when the AIDS broke out, you remember for the first time,

52
00:10:44,130 --> 00:11:00,620
and I was there and I treated a lot of young men with AIDS, I don't know if that is true anymore but during that time

53
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:14,120
when the first victims of AIDS were coming
I found out almost invariably that this young man had been infected

54
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,240
by Gonorrhea and by Syphilis.

55
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:23,780
Because mostly the group that was in
danger were the homosexuals, why?

56
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:38,250
Because they were practicing sex without any protection. Wild sex, when I asked them their practices

57
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:52,290
it was unbelievable they were describing to me  they were doing. I remember case who said,

58
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:55,980
'I had sex three times this morning and in the night I could not get sleep and I had to go out to the bars

59
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:11,340
 in which they had sex inside the bars, something like that. Baths, they had sex there without protection

60
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:22,110
and then he said, I got Gonorrhea and I got Syphilis and I was treated with penicillin and again penicillin.

61
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:39,490
It was very interesting that every time they were taking antibiotics, they were cured. The moment they were cured

62
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:59,740
they could get it again, be infected again because actually penicillin was able to cure in a lot of such cases

63
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:13,250
and let the organism free, especially those organisms that were strong organisms and they could overcome

64
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,620
 the disease plus the antibiotics.

65
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:28,480
Then one time, two, three, five times, some of them told me finally we decided to take

66
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,640
constantly antibiotics to be covered.

67
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:38,780
So every day for 1,2, 3 years constantly antibiotics in order to have a protection.

68
00:13:39,750 --> 00:14:03,700
In the end of such practices the manifestation of AIDS came so with my knowledge of what is happening

69
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,310
with these infective agents etc. I realized what was happening in their organisms.

70
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:25,130
What was happening was that the organism because they were strong young men, with a lot of vitality,

71
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:46,940
very high sexual desire something very seldom here in a normal man-wife situation; it seems that they are over sexed

72
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:52,950
 to the extend that they are driven
completely to have sexual contact.

73
00:14:54,470 --> 00:15:09,000
Therefore in the end they came with Kaposi's sarcoma, with pneumonia Carinii, in a terrible state of depletion

74
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:21,010
and of course I was battling to help them, it was not possible because they would start over again the practices.

75
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:33,770
But the interesting thing was that I said to them, since when it was the last infection.

76
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:55,600
The last infection with gonorrhea I had it 3 years ago. 2 years ago. From that time started the depletion of the immune system.

77
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:07,760
Once the immune system has been totally subdued due to the practices of infection, antibiotics,

78
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,660
infection again, antibiotics, the immune system gave up and the manifestation of AIDS appeared

79
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:24,580
 and it was interesting that AIDS means exactly the suppression of the immune system.

80
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:38,160
The immune deficiency. How came? They didn't want to investigate and it was left to me to write eventually the book

81
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:52,910
" A New Model for Health and Disease " in which I explain all this idea and what it was really happening.

82
00:16:54,110 --> 00:17:10,820
And how could they prevent it. In Africa Gonorrhea and Syphilis are killing most of the people,

83
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:29,510
because of the infections because it seems that in order to reach that state of immune suppression

84
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,320
and having the AIDS syndrome,
you have to have a predisposition.

85
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:51,400
This predisposition is created through repeated infections with sexually transmitted diseases in general.

86
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:25,430
What is happening, for instance, if two parents were infected in young years by gonorrhea.

87
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:41,810
 What do you think the child born will have?

88
00:18:41,910 --> 00:19:00,170
The question is the child is going to be born with a severe pathology or is going to be born with a predisposition

89
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:15,480
for getting the infection or is going to be born with deep predisposition for a chronic condition?

90
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:49,050
If you're going to treat a case of parents having primary gonorrhea and you're treating the child,

91
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:51,680
the child is going to be very very sick.

92
00:19:51,780 --> 00:20:14,040
I mean in comparison with the levels of health. It's going to be on 7, 8 level of health, 9,10 cancer, what do you think?

93
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:25,120
Nobody can answer ok. I tell you.

94
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:39,870
In order to get gonorrhea, some person
has to be on high level of health.

95
00:20:51,110 --> 00:21:11,860
Let us say, on the second, third, fourth level around this area; so therefore both parents were actually

96
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:23,110
quite healthy when they got infected and now their health has been diminished because of the infection.

97
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:46,370
So the child is going to be born with some pathology which will appear severe pathology but which will be

98
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,270
manageable to Homeopathy.

99
00:21:47,370 --> 00:22:02,880
Like this man has severe pathology but we consider it as manageable to Homeopathy because the remedy

100
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:16,130
will be clear and in spite of the fact that the pathology may be strong, still the person will be able to raise fever.

101
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:32,780
Different is the case in which the parents of the parents, grand mother, grand father had both gonorrhea

102
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,280
 or one of them had gonorrhea.

103
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:56,350
They pass the pathology to the child but also they pass the predisposition to the sycotic miasm.

104
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:14,570
The child may not have been infected with gonorrhea himself but it has the predisposition and comes

105
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:18,560
with a woman who has the predisposition
 for a psychotic miasm.

106
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:26,540
The third generation is going to be born
with predisposition on a deeper level.

107
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:51,540
As long as the predisposition is such that as soon as it comes in contact with Gonorrhea,

108
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,470
 gets Gonorrhea, the health is good.

109
00:23:53,570 --> 00:24:04,450
If the predisposition is such that when it comes to the Gonorrhea does not get it, the health is bad.

110
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:20,810
It is the opposite of what we may be thinking because the predisposition of the Gonorrhea which

111
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:34,040
is running through the generation, protects
 the person from getting infected.

112
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:54,090
Likewise the AIDS people once they start getting the immunosuppressive syndrome, they stop being infected.

113
00:24:55,110 --> 00:25:01,290
They cannot be infected anymore with either  Gonorrhea or Syphilis or whatever.

114
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:16,810
Now they are infected with pneumonia Carinii. This is a kind of pneumonia which is considered as a kind of

115
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:31,790
 pneumonia which is of a weak type, yet it undermines, eats up the organism to such an extent

116
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:34,200
that does not allow the immune system to recover.

117
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:48,310
It's like an immune system which has been totally suppressed and accepts not powerful microbes anymore.

118
00:25:49,540 --> 00:26:04,810
Because powerful microbes or viruses etc. the organism can not deal with them. It says, just forget them,

119
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:07,360
I have another problem now.

120
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:22,370
In that state we see the development of infections which are of a low type infections, like the pneumonia Carinii.

121
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:39,970
Once an AIDS person starts having the infection by pneumonia Carinii, then it is in the last stage, his life has actually finished.

122
00:26:42,550 --> 00:27:01,210
All kind of medications they are given, whatever is the treatment, the life of such person is over. Why?

123
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:14,830
Because as long as they were strong the organism, they were infected. Again they were treated

124
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:15,730
and got better and infected.

125
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:31,550
Until the organism gives up and his
immune system is suppressed;

126
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,460
it is very interesting that the syndrome is
called immunodeficiency syndrome.

127
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:46,590
This is what we have been saying and we wrote an article with a medical doctor who is an expert in immunology

128
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:57,100
and she said to me when she was sitting there, she is a Greek doctor, she said, immunology has found a lot of things

129
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,240
 but it can not put it together.

130
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:08,580
Your system, your model is putting
 together all the findings of immunology.

131
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:18,850
We wrote together an article which is
going to come out, will be posted as well.

132
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:29,900
We connect Homeopathy and immunology, the findings of immunology because what I said was that I found out

133
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:37,240
at a certain moment when I was examining a case and I was asking, when it was the last time you had a fever?

134
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:45,280
This was very long.
Oh God, I have a difficult case.

135
00:28:46,250 --> 00:29:04,000
If the person had a high fever and it's very interesting to us, the last high fever was a year ago only

136
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:14,750
but very strong and a lot of drugs were prescribed and after this the problems really had aggravated and started.

137
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:30,190
You see all this makes sense for Medicine in general, which the conventional medical people do not want

138
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:32,570
to take into consideration.

139
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:44,010
They will be forced to take them into consideration because what we're saying is really the truth

140
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:59,730
and they will be forced eventually to admit that we are creating a population which is sick by suppressing acute diseases.

141
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:21,750
We got so many cases of children with severe chronic problems and you take the history of such children

142
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:35,250
and you see before infections, infections, especially little girls, they were not infected by sexual things,

143
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,400
they started with cystitis, antibiotics.

144
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:48,480
After 6 months again cystitis, again antibiotics, after four months cystitis, again antibiotics,

145
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:52,000
 after 3 months cystitis, antibiotics,
after 2 months cystitis, antibiotics.

146
00:30:54,050 --> 00:31:07,320
So when the parents come, say we
almost have to give constant antibiotics.

147
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,330
She is relapsing all the time
 with the cystitis the girl.

148
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:14,590
But the girl which is now coming to us
is not getting anymore cystitis.

149
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:25,810
Since when finished the cystitis in
 certain cases? Since 1,2 years.

150
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:42,410
Some of the parents here about us and they come in time because if they come in time, the child can be saved easily.

151
00:31:43,560 --> 00:32:02,170
When they come and they say, 2 years ago it was the last cystitis, but now the child has

152
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:04,300
mental, emotional problems that is difficult case.

153
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:12,290
You understand how important it is to know these things and to understand how diseases are developing?

154
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:30,040
These are not known things in the general kind of Homeopathy which is practiced. These things are kept secret.

155
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:44,520
Don't go to Vithoulkas, he is old kind of Homeopathy and now we have modern Homeopathy

156
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:56,030
where we give the new drugs we have
 proved and all that kind of things.

157
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:57,900
The core remedy, the vital sensations,
 what is the vital sensation?

158
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:06,710
It's one symptom in a case unless you put together all the other symptoms, forget the vital sensation.

159
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:23,980
Is that possible? The vital sensation is insecurity ok, so what? You go to the Repertory you give a new remedy

160
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:36,230
that has been imagined or so called proved. Because who is doing a correct proving today?

161
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:38,330
Very few people know what is a correct proving.
