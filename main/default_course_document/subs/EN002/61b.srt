1
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:38,360
This is a case where the patient will come and tell you, everything is bad. I have this, I have that

2
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:51,120
and they relate all kind of symptoms which
 they had before, even new symptoms now.

3
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:21,430
And they will not admit at first any amelioration. This can happen with certain remedies like Thuja, like Staphysagria

4
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:36,150
like Natrum muriaticum, closed patients, not communicative, they are suspicious, not exactly

5
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:46,250
but they don't believe what you're doing
and little changes mean nothing to them.

6
00:01:47,920 --> 00:02:00,340
Before you go and give another remedy, make sure that really your remedy, I'm talking about a month time,

7
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:16,870
 has really not brought about any change. This is a case like Richard's. We investigated it is not this, not that....

8
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:31,000
Finally you make sure that the remedy is wrong, you give another remedy but there are some patients especially

9
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:44,240
those who are really closed, as I said, that they will not admit that in the mental-emotional there are changes that take place.

10
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,570
In such a case you give placebo.

11
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:00,100
Why I say that? Because this is totally different from a patient who comes and says

12
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:09,020
immediately, 'I feel better psychologically
but my ailments are the same'.

13
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,390
This is totally different case I'm talking about here. You have to differentiate. Here the patient says,

14
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:29,460
'no change' and he is really holding to this
 idea and by examining subtly you say,

15
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:39,640
'what about your irritability?
Are you as irritable as before?'. 'Yes'.

16
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:49,780
 You have to observe in the voice, there is a doubt. That means if the person thinks

17
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:57,560
 and at the same time says something but
he's not sure the tone of voice changes.

18
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:07,890
Because you can see he's thinking, but he does not want to admit. The first thing he says is no but this no

19
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:17,660
you can perceive that he is thinking.
 And then you insist, you try to find out

20
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:28,480
'in a similar situation how you behaved?
Did you throw the plate to your husband?'

21
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,900
 You get this kind of reaction with this patient. If he's going to tell you, it's the same

22
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:53,240
and finally admits he's better mental-emotional, not better, he will not admit better, maybe a little bit.

23
00:04:55,270 --> 00:05:03,610
Immediately be aware of such a case
and don't run to prescribe another remedy.

24
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:18,440
You will be surprised that such cases may
tell you the third month, I'm totally cured.

25
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:31,390
Actually what is taking place is a kind of aggravation in their physical symptomatology.

26
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:41,980
Even if they are a little bit worse they will not even say. 'I'm the same, what is the difference',

27
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:54,820
but admitting mentally or emotionally there is a difference, you just wait and you will see the next month.

28
00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:02,210
If next month they will say, it's the same, the third month forget it, you're going to give another remedy.

29
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:21,300
I want to make you aware of this type of person and you will see this type of person because he will not establish contact.

30
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:36,380
Nevermind how much you try to be nice, they will keep to themselves, they will not come out and communicate really.

31
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:49,340
There is a trick also here which you can do and many times it works and saves the patient's life and your life also.

32
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:54,680
What is the trick?

33
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,640
I've told you before but you forgot.

34
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:25,700
The trick is to tell: 'listen you have to tell me the whole truth because we have 2000 remedies and if what I gave you

35
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:38,960
is the right remedy, I'm going to try 1999 more possibilities that we have. That means 1999 months of observation.

36
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:50,120
So if we lose this remedy which is going to be good for you, forget it we'll never find the correct remedy

37
00:07:50,220 --> 00:08:06,100
and there you see the reaction. They go back and they start excuse themselves and then they open up and say,

38
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:13,340
'oh no this I don't have, but you know my
stomach is still in pain'.

39
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:22,640
'Yes I understand'.
The prescription is placebo.

40
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:38,820
You have to be a very good judge of human nature.

41
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:55,520
And some people also like to be sick and this is part of their sickness also. They like to say, 'I'm sick '

42
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:05,080
so the others will pay attention. The husband will look after or the wife will look after the husband.

43
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,280
 Usually is the woman.

44
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,410
What is this reaction?

45
00:09:42,840 --> 00:10:01,200
You did not like it but why? Usually is the woman who says my husband wants to rely on me, this is what I meant.

46
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:27,240
The feministic movement is very strong
 in the class. It's ok, here we like objectivity!

47
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:08,380
To admit that you are weak, that means you are strong. Nobody who is really weak will admit, I'm weak.

48
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:20,980
If somebody says, I'm weak, you watch out. If they admit publically, they say it very easily,

49
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:26,820
you know I'm very weak person watch out.

50
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:48,520
This is a particular type that I'm talking about for this reaction, it's a group of people that you must not miss.

51
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:57,240
Otherwise they will mislead you every time. You give another remedy and another remedy and eventually they will leave you.

52
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:15,210
-But in case the patient now, after you made the trick, tells you things which he didn't tell before

53
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:22,290
 and a new picture comes up then
 you still give placebo?

54
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,900
-Yes you still give placebo.

55
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,260
-Why?

56
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:37,440
-If he admits that he's better in certain areas which he hided before, even if he says

57
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:42,180
 'I have also this and that, I'm also impotent'.

58
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:48,300
Did you ever ask a man whether you
are impotent, he says no, I'm normal.

59
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:55,520
You liked it? Objectivity!

60
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:17,540
Then he comes and says, you know also I have to tell you something, I just remembered it. The last 2-3 years I'm not....

61
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:27,520
You see it's difficult for a man to admit because it is connected with the symbolism, I'm a man.

62
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:41,240
So even if he says a new symptom but he admits I'm better in especially mental-emotional, you don't give another remedy.

63
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,660
-If he is worse?

64
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,340
-If he is the same or worse yes,
you give another remedy.

65
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:06,520
If he has an aggravation really,
 if you think it's an aggravation you wait.

66
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:14,890
-Never mind if the patient is closed
 or not, he shows any reaction to the remedy?

67
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,820
-If there is an aggravation?

68
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:30,180
-If the patient is closed or not, there should
be a reaction in the form of an aggravation.

69
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:41,080
-Is he asking or he says, it should be?
 Is this a question?

70
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:57,980
-It's a question. You didn't put it as a question. No, it should not be when the patient belongs to

71
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:06,080
either first group or last group
there can be no apparent aggravation.

72
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:23,090
In 1976 I presented a paper in the LIGA meeting which was published in the American Journal of Homeopathy

73
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:45,750
around that time and we looked at the file, me and Irini Bachas, my first student, it must be 76, 78 around that time.

74
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:57,460
In this paper we made a statistic and we found out that we had 80% of the patients that were coming,

75
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:10,390
initial aggravation in 80% of the cases. We published this. During this period it was unheard, the aggravation.

76
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:18,620
A whole congress didn't want to hear about it. Everyone who was in the congress by that time, was a polypharmacist

77
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:27,140
and they could not have seen or if they have seen, they never attributed to homeopathic remedy.

78
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:42,860
They say, what is this and it was fought very badly. We had very bad critiques and I was surprised that Ortega,

79
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:58,800
he is a very good Homeopath, very old also, he's about my age. He is a bit older, maybe 12 years older.

80
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:14,940
He was more experienced at that time, he had 12-15 years more experience than me at this moment where

81
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:22,380
I had only 15 years of experience,
he had 30 years of experience.

82
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:31,860
He said 'what is this? An aggravation? We have never seen'. So he gave an interview to Allen N.

83
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:39,010
 which was published again in the Journal of the American Institute of Homeopathy in which he stated that there

84
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:43,030
is no such thing in Homeopathy, as aggravation.

85
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:55,600
I could not believe it. He said, if you find the right remedy, the right potency, no aggravation.

86
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:12,370
He was supposed to be somebody who followed Kent etc. and I said to his student Rosa Belendes,

87
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:21,740
she was a very clever Mexican woman, short
 one but devil, her mind was going like this.

88
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:31,780
I said to her what about Kent? You studied
 Kent what Kent says about that?

89
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:46,920
She brought some arguments to cover up the idea of Ortega but for me it was really happening.

90
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:56,360
Everyone would come saying, what did you give me? And we never said to any person,

91
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:01,370
 you are going to have a reaction.
We never said it.

92
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:05,540
 Because if you say it, it's different, they may produce it but during these times

93
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:24,180
practicing under dictatorship an illegal medicine in a country which was very conservative, the army people

94
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:33,500
were taking over, they were leading
Greece, I was not  a medical doctor, it was terrific.

95
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:39,540
 You could not say to the patient you're
going to have an aggravation.

96
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:51,550
It would be another revolution for Greece. But almost every patient would say, they're having an initial aggravation.

97
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:58,860
The cases were much more easy than they are today. The people were much more healthy than they are today.

98
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:17,810
30 years later people have gone down,  the real health has gone down. You may live 15 years with Alzheimer's.

99
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:09,400
This is a case where the patient admits
an amelioration on a physical symptom.

100
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:19,910
Is that possible, one or two symptoms are better?

101
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:38,980
This is also a possibility of slow reaction of the organism and it is good if you wait, you give them placebo

102
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:47,340
and you wait one more month. If this was the beginning of an amelioration, then the next month you will be better,

103
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:56,630
the third month will be even better etc.
But if the second month comes and he says,

104
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:12,000
 'that symptom that was better, now is 50% back', that means your remedy was only partially acting.

105
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:41,720
For instance, a constitutional symptom, physical, which is better for a while, is not a good sign. Unless it's an acute.

106
00:22:43,960 --> 00:23:03,980
But if it's a constitutional, ex. a woman had several times inflammation of the vagina and she was treated with antibiotics.

107
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:12,900
Then she comes to you and as you treat
 her the vaginitis comes, then you prescribe

108
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:23,720
and the symptoms go away, only these symptoms go away. That is probably the wrong prescription.

109
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:34,220
But if she comes and for the first time
she has a cystitis she was infected

110
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:42,840
 and you give the remedy and the cystitis
goes away, that is the correct reaction.

111
00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:00,300
-I think it's a very good reaction,
in group 4 I think it's a very good reaction.

112
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,610
-No.

113
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:19,430
-George, could you explain that again, it was not totally clear I think. The first possibility with the antibiotics.

114
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:39,340
-The woman comes to be treated for something you understand is rather a constitutional reaction. If the woman gets cystitis

115
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:55,100
5 years she has cystitis, she comes to you,
you give a remedy and the burning goes away

116
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:05,860
without any other reaction aggravation or improvement. This is the wrong reaction.

117
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:16,930
But if she comes for the first time as an acute, she has been infected for the first time and you give a remedy

118
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:26,020
and the symptoms of cystitis go away, that is treating an acute and they have to go away with the treatment.

119
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:39,260
In the other way you have to take into consideration the whole picture in order to prescribe.

120
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:54,540
She has a cold now, you don't have to take into consideration all the picture, you can prescribe for the cold.

121
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:09,620
You prescribe for the cold, the cold goes away, that's ok. But if this is a hay fever, this reaction what you consider

122
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:21,740
to be a cold that means an allergic condition which comes every spring or autumn and you prescribe

123
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:28,320
and the symptoms go away without
any change, that is wrong.

124
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:13,620
Here, these groups, they can get acute infections. These groups as you go down, the acutes either

125
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:28,460
they are minimal, they will get the idea of an acute, not a real acute and as you go down you don't get acutes.

126
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:49,780
But if here they get an acute, it is going to be very severe, that means that when you have a person in group 4

127
00:27:49,880 --> 00:28:05,100
with schizophrenia, one day such a person develops a very high fever with pneumonia, he's going to die.

128
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:15,890
The pneumonia is to bring death in
 this group. It's a very serious acute.

129
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:32,160
It is more serious than the schizophrenia.
What is more serious? Death. Then what you do?

130
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:45,570
Sometimes in the mental asylums they see these reactions and immediately they come with the antibiotics

131
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:54,520
and they bring back the person to
delusions and mental aberrations.

132
00:28:55,560 --> 00:29:04,470
Instead, now here there is a possibility if you are a Homeopath, during that period to prescribe and get him out

133
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:17,770
of that mental condition. If you prescribe correctly during the acute here, you get him out of the mental condition.

134
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:46,220
-To this point, do you prescribe for the
 acute or for the constitutional?

135
00:29:48,410 --> 00:30:01,680
-A good question. In this case actually, you must take into consideration some of his constitutional except that the acute

136
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:12,300
is part of the whole picture. Here, it's part of the whole picture. It's not an acute like here that comes upon.

137
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:17,980
In a schizophrenic is very difficult to
 put an acute, to imprint an acute.

138
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:32,580
In these groups you imprint an acute, how?
 What we call an Ignatia state. They lose somebody

139
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:36,220
and they develop Ignatia symptoms.

140
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:47,010
Here a schizophrenic loses 10 people, he does not realize it. You cannot imprint, put it on top.

141
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:57,620
Here, the case is Calcarea carbonica but in the time of death or separation she becomes Ignatia.

142
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:11,360
Supposing she comes to you after a stress and for the first time you see the patient. You see Ignatia symptoms,

143
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:21,740
you give Ignatia. After Ignatia, you will see Calcarea carbonica. That means the person was not constitutional Ignatia

144
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:28,060
but Ignatia was imprinted because of the
stress of the grief. Here you cannot imprint it.

145
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:40,800
Here you can imprint a Bryonia on top of Calcarea carbonica. You can imprint Allium cepa or Euphrasia

146
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:45,020
upon a Sulphur, an underlying constitution.

147
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:53,980
That means if the person had come to you before the cold or the acute, you would have given Sulphur.

148
00:31:54,080 --> 00:32:06,100
He comes during the acute and you prescribe Euphrasia, you have to prescribe Euphrasia, unless his symptoms

149
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:19,780
of the acute are coming together with his chronic symptoms. Then in his cold you can prescribe Sulphur

150
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:27,520
and then you relieve him from both,
acute or chronic. It is a very good condition.

151
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:36,880
Despair of learning.

152
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:49,360
-You said something very interesting to us. In a chronic state where the person gets an acute illness,

153
00:32:49,460 --> 00:33:05,860
this acute will show the underlying miasm. It means that in group 3 or 4, I would have to take the totality of his symptoms?

154
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:23,280
-No. You don't have to take the chronic symptoms together with the acute.

155
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:39,780
We say, in some cases which are few, not many, the chronic conditions will be falling into the picture of the acute.

156
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:54,710
That means the acute is a picture of Arsenicum but the chronic symptoms of the person are also symptoms of Arsenicum.

157
00:33:56,090 --> 00:34:08,020
That is a good case where your remedy will take care of the acute and the chronic. But this is not frequent.

158
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:26,850
A person is restless, he is very cold, he has gastritis, ulcer, he is drinking water by sips.

159
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:35,600
That's his picture and he comes to you and he says I have a cold and every time I have a cold
 I feel it in my chest.

160
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:47,660
 And I have a running nose and the discharge is watery and acrid and I'm always restless.

161
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:53,060
You drink water like this?
Always I like to drink sips of water.

162
00:34:53,160 --> 00:35:05,340
Thank God. That's a case of Arsenicum. You give Arsenicum and his ulcer, colitis, whatever it might be,

163
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:12,880
will go away together with his cold.
But not always.

164
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:28,100
-Sometimes in a case of acute in group 3 or 4, we first treat the acute symptoms

165
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:36,380
unless by luck you have the same with the chronic.

166
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:48,740
-That's it, by luck. Here, group 3 and 4 there are acutes you can ignore. The people will say,

167
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:56,240
I get some acutes but I don't treat. My nose
 is running, a little bit this, a little bit that,

168
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:11,130
 if they get some acute is mild, the organism does not react really to an invasion of virus or bacteria.

169
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:30,180
My theory is based on observations. My theory
 is that you take these people here and you inject them

170
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:48,910
 with tuberculosis bacillus, no effect. The bacillus will be killed in a few minutes later in the blood of these people.

171
00:36:49,760 --> 00:37:06,520
You inject them with syphilis; the spirochete will die in the blood of the schizophrenic. It is very poisonous.

172
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:18,740
I don't know but these are ideas that can be researched, proposals for a research.

173
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:37,700
But here, there are some bacteria which affect these levels but then this is very very serious.

174
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:49,010
We have different types of pneumonia. In older times we used to have the streptococcal pneumonia,

175
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:59,100
the staphylococcal pneumonia. Today we have fungi which are producing pneumonias.

176
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:09,520
 This is different kind of pneumonias,
much more aggressive, much more deadly.

177
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:31,550
These are general ideas and the interesting thing which I maintain is that when a person, a schizophrenic of 10 years,

178
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:43,020
who never came to his senses, during the time
 of the pneumonia but not in the beginning, in the end,

179
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:52,630
when the pneumonia is bringing him near to death, this person will come back to his senses,

180
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:58,960
for a few days before dying he will be sane.

181
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:10,900
Why? Because the force of the disease
 has come all upon the physical body.

182
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:17,000
The mental-emotional is left and it is
upon the  physical body.

183
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,020
-Is it possible to treat this kind of pneumonia?

184
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:32,260
-Theoretically it is possible,
in practice is going to be very difficult.

185
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:51,070
The defence mechanism is in a state, people die from pneumonia, there is 60-80% who die with or without antibiotics.

186
00:39:52,760 --> 00:40:05,690
What it means is that their defenses are just to the point where they fight the last fight and then they collapse.

187
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:16,740
Some of these cases, I believe, you can save. How many I don't know.

188
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:33,490
- I've seen a case of 30 year mental patient, schizophrenic, paranoia, everything and they tried to give him

189
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:40,380
Lithium and another new mixture of drugs and he completely collapsed. His kidneys collapsed,

190
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:49,040
he got very high sugar in his blood,
 he was completely finished.

191
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:59,300
And this time they had to take the drugs off and he was sane, he was beautifully sane and in the minute that

192
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:04,920
everything stabilized, the physical, then he became crazy again.

193
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:18,420
-These ideas I teach for years and years, nobody is listening, the medical authorities. You don't know,

194
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:27,360
you are charlatans and you are dreamers, all kind of things but they don't see the facts.

195
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:39,310
I have seen a lot and I have heard a lot of this kind of reaction and anyone who has an idea of these laws, takes notice.

196
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:49,200
Because if you don't have an idea of the laws, you say he has fever, we have to bring down the fever.

197
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:53,800
That's all they know. They don't connect.

198
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:03,100
-I did not understand quite well which symptom of the chronic state you can take.

199
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:10,860
In a schizophrenic you take pneumonia
and then some chronic?

200
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,440
-Which one? Everything that is possible.

201
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:28,290
I said you have to take, in these low groups, you have to take in consideration the symptoms of the patient

202
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:31,740
as a generality not only the pneumonia.

203
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:36,940
On the first group you take the pneumonia symptoms, you give and you treat.

204
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:42,780
In the lower groups you have to take in consideration everything that was going on.

205
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:57,170
It is part of the whole disease. Pneumonia on these upper groups is a remedy which is imprinted,

206
00:42:57,270 --> 00:43:03,220
added upon his miasmatic condition.

207
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:18,880
Here, pneumonia is a part of schizophrenia. Diabetes is a part of schizophrenia.

208
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:34,420
-Could you relate to that point of psychotic etc.
 in terms of primary and secondary action?

209
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:41,580
 Because I have the understanding that
when the psychotic has a primary action,

210
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:50,260
 has accepted the disease but
he faces the secondary action.

211
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:04,580
-We didn't understand.

212
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,260
-Ok, I will repeat.

213
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:29,540
-My understanding is that the primary action according to Hahnemann...

214
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:38,540
-Ok, you use the word primary, secondary reaction in comparison with something else

215
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,580
which happens in the mental case.

216
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:48,060
He says, in a mental case you have a person who receives some impression from the outside world

217
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:57,180
and these stresses he cannot process and he develops schizophrenia. He develops mental symptoms because

218
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:02,930
he cannot cope with the stresses around.

219
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:16,950
  Is this primary or secondary action in comparison with what Hahnemann says? Is that your question?

220
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:24,260
-My question is would you agree that the problem with the psychotic is the secondary action,

221
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:38,090
he cannot perform the  secondary action which is coming and re-establishing a state of harmony and health?

222
00:45:46,200 --> 00:46:01,140
- You see the idea is that every symptom is a defense towards something which is worse.

223
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:13,120
The symptoms of schizophrenia are a reaction towards a stress that will bring death.

224
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:24,580
The organism decides that if I keep and I try to fight that stress, I'm going to die. Instead of this I divert it

225
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:40,260
and I make a mental aberration or delusion. These delusions are the result of the defense mechanism

226
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:48,210
to get away from a reality that will bring death.

227
00:46:49,020 --> 00:47:01,180
What I say is now, here is a diversion towards the mental. Now the organism by whatever happens,

228
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:11,300
has another diversion, instead of death and this is pneumonia, this goes to the physical body.

229
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:24,710
It diverts this whole thing. This whole thing goes away and you have a strong reaction on the physical body.

230
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:30,780
That is going again to bring death.
Why this does not bring death?

231
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:46,430
Because we know that all mental aberrations they allow the rest of the physical body to perform its actions.

232
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:59,740
We say, this old man is so healthy, he never gets sick. Because the old man suffers from Alzheimer's.

233
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:11,380
So the death has come upon this mental-emotional part and allows the physical body to live.

234
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:28,350
Here, by your medicine, by environment, by whatever, this person develops diabetes or develops

235
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:41,980
a physical disease like strong diabetes that
 takes the person away, or tuberculosis.

236
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:53,100
While he develops tuberculosis, the person is going to die here, but his mental will be clear,

237
00:48:53,200 --> 00:49:02,720
 the force of the disease will come to the physical body and will allow the mental-emotional to function more freely.

238
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:13,300
And this is the problem we face as Homeopaths because when we prescribe correctly,  we clear up from the

239
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:29,230
mental to the physical and the physical gets all the stress. And the person has come and says, 'what about my ulcer?'.

240
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:42,440
The ulcer we heal much later because first the mental-emotional has to be rearranged and the ulcer is going to be worse.

241
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:48,020
This is what you are learning
through these observations.

242
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:57,010
-Pneumonia is actually a desperate
try of the organism to become healthy.

243
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:08,230
-Absolutely, it is a reaction of the organism to become healthy. There is a big fever, a turmoil,

244
00:50:08,330 --> 00:50:17,800
a crisis and then you go out of
this and maybe you will be saved.

245
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:33,450
-This reminds me a long time ago when
I first started my practice as a chiropractor,

246
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:39,620
I had a patient who was psychologist.
 And he sent one of his patients who was very

247
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:46,220
 classic schizophrenic but he was under
 control with the medication, he was functioning in the world.

248
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:52,140
  He was getting a lot of headaches and a lot of shoulder pain. So as an experiment he said

249
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:59,030
I send my patient to you to see what can happen, if you can help him. So he came to me for maybe two months

250
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:06,660
and his headaches were getting better, his shoulder pains were getting better but then all of a sudden he got very crazy.

251
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:14,780
I started taking letters from him, I hear your voice coming from the Empire State building, I feel your fingers in my brain.

252
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,550
So we had to stop the experiment because he was getting much worse, emotionally.

253
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:27,910
-Actually what you were doing, you were just bringing him back to this level where the level of the disease

254
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:39,420
started going down to the physical body, and then back again in the mental aberration.

255
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:44,360
 That's very correct, the observation.

256
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:54,640
This is something that I believe everyone who practices medicine of whatever form should be aware.

257
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:08,400
-I have seen your observations; in the States I used to work in a mental institution for the State and these were all

258
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:18,180
severe schizophrenic individuals with severe mental-emotional disorders and every winter, being in NY

259
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:26,980
the flu season would come around but the medical treatment was very backward, even by allopathic standards.

260
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:37,140
Hard to believe, double contradiction but the patients would all come down with the flu and they would start

261
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:41,580
 having very interesting conversations. They would start interacting in a much healthier way,

262
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:46,700
 and their behaviour improved, they would
start being much healthier in every way

263
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:53,520
and then the physician would come and he would administering antibiotics and they would go back again.

264
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:16,140
-In the same way, some psychiatrists give allopathic drugs to mental cases and then they see some

265
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:27,440
skin eruptions tremendous skin eruptions and they send them immediately to the dermatologist, he pushes it back, finished.

266
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:41,920
Simple things like that and they're not observed by the medical profession and they don't want to listen.

267
00:53:50,090 --> 00:54:02,280
-We should not tell the patient about bad reaction, initial aggravation, you said before we should not tell.

268
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:10,180
But if we don't tell there might be a bad reaction like skin eruption, they run to the dermatologist

269
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:14,980
so we have to instruct them
but you said, we should not.

270
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:25,110
-No. If somebody comes and says, I have this problem but when I was 12 years old I had severe skin eruption,

271
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:31,980
you say my dear sir if I give you for your headaches a remedy, most probably,

272
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:38,230
you will get back your skin eruption,
would you like to start the treatment?

273
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:49,880
-And when before he never had a skin eruption?

274
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,380
-No, he will not get.

275
00:54:56,560 --> 00:55:05,980
-I would like to ask a question. I've got a case, a Lycopodium woman, she had a lot of colds

276
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:10,190
and sinusitis and cystitis and took a lot of antibiotics.

277
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:20,750
I try to cure her and I give Lycopodium, not many things changed and suddenly she has a cystitis.

278
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:33,500
I tried to repeat Lycopodium at first, it didn't act. So she had pains in the kidney and she felt very bad.

279
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:41,560
What to do? I can't take the responsibility.
She had a lot of blood in the urine as well.

280
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:50,740
She had the symptoms of Berberis. What am
 I supposed to do at that point?

281
00:55:50,840 --> 00:56:00,780
-Give her Berberis and then wait. If there
 is no effect, give another remedy.

282
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,900
-It had effect. It went away in one day.

283
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:13,140
-Then you wait, then you will see the
sinusitis coming most probably.

284
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:17,120
-It already did.

285
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:31,780
-There is a series. In the beginning there was an order, first it was a cold and then the sinusitis,

286
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:40,660
then the antibiotics were given and the flora was spoiled then eventually she started developing cystitis.

287
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:48,590
 She was treated for cystitis, then back the sinusitis, and then finally she came to you.

288
00:56:49,250 --> 00:57:01,060
You are going to re-establish the order. How this has started and you ask, how this whole thing started?

289
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:10,900
I remember I had this severe cold and that developed a severe sinusitis and then antibiotics

290
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:16,350
six months later I had cystitis.

291
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:28,700
Then you know that the last thing you have to treat is the sinusitis. It will come or maybe the opposite way

292
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:42,100
because the organism when you give a chemical, may kill the bacteria, this is what they do.

293
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:56,340
If we have an infection with virus, antibiotics will do nothing but if we have a bacteria, it will be killed by penicillin

294
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:07,740
or other antibiotics; at the same time some useful bacteria are killed and if the organism is not able to rearrange what it lost,

295
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:14,420
it's going to develop another condition. And the next condition is going to be worse than the first

296
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:22,140
 and the next is going to be worse than the previous one. Then if you take the history when they come finally

297
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:28,380
they are wrecks and we slowly take them back.

298
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:40,660
In your case it was going to develop quite severe kidney infection unless you give the right remedy.

299
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:50,420
And then you will say, now take antibiotics because I cannot do anything for you anymore.

300
00:58:50,520 --> 00:59:00,060
Fortunately the Berberis was really indicated and acted and stopped the process. Now this person either it's going to be

301
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:13,930
cured and stay for 20 years well or it's going to go even further back, to the original cystitis or sinusitis.

302
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:22,130
-It wasn't a suppression then at that time when I gave Berberis because you said with the skin eruption,

303
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:28,870
 nothing to do but when the illness is severe
 then I have to act in any way.

304
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:32,240
-Absolutely.

305
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:41,820
-George, I just wanted to make sure if I got you right. It's about prescription in acute cases.

306
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:51,490
If you have an acute, as far as I understood you, you have to look if the patient belongs to group 1 or 2, then you can

307
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:59,980
prescribe on acute symptoms. If he belongs to group 3 or 4 then you have to look at the whole case and try to find

308
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:05,020
the remedy that covers up the whole
case and not take only the acute.

309
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:06,860
-Right.

310
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,520
-Thank you.

311
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:32,200
-Let's say there is a patient in group 3 or 4 and he is a mental case and because of his mental state he needs Hyoscyamus.

312
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:42,020
He gets a cold but the symptoms for the cold
 are for Phosphorus or let's say, Belladona.

313
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:53,560
 Then there is a great discrepancy between the chronic symptoms and the acute symptoms, what shall we do?

314
01:00:53,760 --> 01:01:02,700
-Wait a moment. You have not treated at all yet. He comes and you take his case and you see that his

315
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:08,370
chronic symptoms belong to Hyoscyamus and his acute symptoms is Phosphorus. You give Phosphorus.

316
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:16,000
In any group if you have a clear picture.

317
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:26,720
The problem is when the picture is not clear and then you give the remedy and then you just suppress it.

318
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:35,590
-I wanted to mention an observation, I don't know if anybody already mentioned this. I was working in a anthroposophic

319
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:44,740
psychiatry and when they had clients that were going so mad, they would have to rise the allopathic remedy

320
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:50,460
so high and it wouldn't have any effect, they would give them injections which would produce fever,

321
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:57,380
high fever to 40 degrees. Afterwards, they could go down very much with the allopathic remedies,

322
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:06,710
the people were pretty clear but it was very exhausting and very risky thing to do but they do it.

323
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:21,520
-This is what I say exactly but it's very risky of course.

324
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:27,970
When you get this kind of acute it's going
 to be between life and death situation.

325
01:02:28,070 --> 01:02:40,810
There is in recurrent ear infection,
a damage somewhere on the defense chain.

326
01:02:40,910 --> 01:03:00,950
Somewhere that defense mechanism has a loop, has a hole. A link is broken, that link is the possibility

327
01:03:01,050 --> 01:03:17,140
at this moment of the organism to be cured.
 The infection invites the bacteria, the organism reaches a level

328
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:26,880
where the bacteria or the virus can
affect it now. That level is good.

329
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:34,930
 Primarily as an idea is good. It gives the organism the opportunity to heal and the organism fights

330
01:03:35,030 --> 01:03:43,740
and does not heal and comes back the ear infection. Until the Homeopath comes, he gives the Mercury

331
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:51,040
and the infections are finished, then he raises the defense mechanism and there is no recurrence.

332
01:03:51,140 --> 01:04:02,500
Otherwise with the antibiotics you are going not only to allow this healing but also to degrade the possibility

333
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:08,680
of the organism and then you open the possibility of the organism to develop something even deeper.

334
01:04:10,450 --> 01:04:22,540
That's why when we see cases and they say, as a small child I had repeated ear infections. Now what you see?

335
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:36,580
It's a mental case terrible, originally started with ear infections, and then treated again and again

336
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:45,500
 and then finally it comes to you and you have to unravel the whole thing until you bring it back to the ear infections.

337
01:04:53,080 --> 01:05:01,200
-One more question concerning the procedures of the patients in group 3 or 4 when they have a severe acute infection.

338
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:07,420
You have said in these cases you also have to take also the chronic underlined symptoms into consideration.

339
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:19,120
Can you give an example because for me I can not even imagine how to treat a pneumonia or a cancer to a mental case.

340
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:37,340
-I gave already the example. You have a pneumonia which shows symptoms of Arsenicum.

341
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:52,790
When you inquire about the chronic symptoms, you see the restlessness etc.

342
01:05:54,120 --> 01:06:01,940
Now this is an easy case and because
 it's easy we place it to these groups.

343
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:06,400
Now you want to know what's
 happening in this group.

344
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:14,380
Here things are not as clear as in these upper groups. Therefore you will have a problem

345
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:18,820
 to find the indicated remedy,
that's why we say it is difficult.

346
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:33,620
It means that symptoms of Arsenicum, let's take the same example, will be in between other symptoms

347
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:40,490
and you will see the possibility of Phosphorus, the possibility of Hyoscyamus, the possibility of Stramonium,

348
01:06:40,590 --> 01:06:43,660
the possibility of this and that.

349
01:06:44,070 --> 01:06:53,260
The symptoms of pneumonia also will not indicate a clear Kali-c picture or Bryonia or Arsenicum.

350
01:06:53,360 --> 01:07:06,710
This is why it is very difficult to treat this because you have to select what is fitting best to the whole of the picture.

351
01:07:06,810 --> 01:07:18,860
That means you have to take into consideration the mental picture of the patient, if possible.

352
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,400
Together with the pneumonia.

353
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:33,340
And you say this pneumonia could be a picture of Phosphorus or a picture of Belladona but he was so violent,

354
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:47,380
ah Belladona is best though he
has thirst for cold water, repeated sips.

355
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:55,580
You select the best remedy
which is Belladona, then you raise.

356
01:07:55,680 --> 01:08:11,260
But it is difficult, that' s why we call them incurable cases. You have to have a lot of experience

357
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:19,900
but imagine if Homeopathy was practiced for 2 centuries correctly, the experience that we would have

358
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:31,740
at this moment and the tradition that we would have, instead of taking hundreds of remedies, throwing them to people.

359
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:41,580
That was a tradition, when I came to Homeopathy. In the congresses I wouldn't dare even talk.

360
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:58,380
Now they invite me, please come. I don't come anymore, it's finished. There is no use. Now I have students, I can tell.

361
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:08,900
Why do I need to go to a Congress to speak for 10 minutes, to say what in 10 min. to explain all that? Is that possible?

362
01:09:21,870 --> 01:09:45,680
-Who has done this? They made Hippocrates with blue eyes? Even Hippocrates must be German.

363
01:09:54,880 --> 01:10:07,380
-I want to ask for the grades, in this group
3 or 4 and if you give to the chronic symptoms,

364
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:12,260
 grade 3 or to the acute symptoms grade 3?

365
01:10:15,690 --> 01:10:29,980
-If the symptom is clear and strong it doesn't matter which group, you underline 3 times, any symptom.

366
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:40,340
It has nothing to do with groups. The underlining of a symptom, 1, 2 or 3 is not connected with the groups.

367
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:52,880
It is connected only with the intensity with which the patient will tell the symptom. She says desire for oysters 'I ate hundreds'.

368
01:10:54,840 --> 01:11:00,880
You underline it, this is a symptom.
