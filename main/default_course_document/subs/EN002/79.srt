1
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:43,640
I want to talk to you and clarify certain issues concerning homeoprophylaxis.

2
00:00:46,560 --> 00:01:02,036
There is a general idea of Arnica being used before an operation and after an operation.

3
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:12,846
Many people say, I'm going to have a tooth extraction; ok take Arnica first so you don't have much bleeding

4
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,206
and then take Arnica afterwards.

5
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:25,616
This is entirely wrong. Why?

6
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:40,806
Because we use Arnica as a blood thinning. Thinning of the blood so if you have a clot of blood,

7
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,136
Arnica dissolves this by thinning the blood.

8
00:01:47,170 --> 00:02:00,576
When you have a blow and there is extravasation of blood and there is blue, the blood has created a clot, you give Arnica

9
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:15,146
and like miracle, this is dissolved. This is dissolved why? Because Arnica is acting like coumarin.

10
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:26,930
You know coumarin? Coumarin is a blood thinning, anticoagulant.

11
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:46,993
That means Arnica is contra-indicated before operation. Because once you have Arnica and you operate

12
00:02:47,093 --> 00:02:50,530
you are going to have more blood.

13
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:55,536
You see the craziness of some people?

14
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:10,506
Not only that but you may get some people say, we had tried a research and we found out that Arnica helps.

15
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:16,996
How they found Arnica helps is another story. You can make a research and prove whatever you like.

16
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:28,466
The fact remains that when you have a heart attack, that means a blood clot is closing an artery

17
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:40,136
the first remedy you will give is Arnica. To do what? To act as an anticoagulant and faster.

18
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:49,760
Do you understand some misunderstandings?

19
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:58,726
Now the Times of London wrote an article 3 months ago.

20
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:04,486
They say, Homeopathy "voodoo medicine", why?

21
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:23,726
He writes the journalist: homeopaths claim that they can give a remedy as a prophylactic to the different epidemic diseases.

22
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:32,176
How comes this? Of course because some people they have written books, articles etc

23
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:42,626
saying, we have the possibility to give a remedy as a prophylaxis.

24
00:04:43,850 --> 00:05:04,840
That means I give you a remedy and if an epidemic comes like small pox, you are protected.

25
00:05:05,696 --> 00:05:12,080
Can you believe? You are protected. How is this?

26
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:28,516
And when I ask what is your reason for writing this and saying this and the Times take this and write that you are voodoo medicine?

27
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:37,536
What is your reason for believing that giving a remedy, let us Thuja or whatever, Morbillinum

28
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:42,786
that it will protect you when the epidemic will come?

29
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:54,700
He says, yes but Hahnemann said that when was an epidemic of scarlet fever during that time

30
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:11,006
he gave Belladonna as a prophylactic so the people would be protected from scarlet fever.

31
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:21,316
See now the misunderstanding of what Hahnemann said and how this has been

32
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:29,696
misinterpreted and presented as a
possibility that we have for a prophylaxis.

33
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:35,546
What happened with Hahnemann's idea?

34
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:44,116
Hahnemann saw that a lot of people were getting the scarlet fever, needed Belladonna.

35
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:53,936
So he thought why not giving Belladonna to everybody so we may have less casualties.

36
00:06:54,010 --> 00:07:08,116
He thought he was doing a prophylaxis. What he was doing was giving a remedy in the beginning of the scarlet fever

37
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:16,376
so the scarlet fever will not develop fully. It was a curative action of Belladonna during the epidemic.

38
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:25,616
During the epidemic, the genius of epidemic that means the remedy that was mostly indicated in that epidemic, was Belladonna.

39
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:37,686
Now the epidemic is ranging and you give Belladonna, you know the epidemic, you know that the remedy is very much indicated

40
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:48,006
those people who will develop symptoms of Belladonna, only these people will have a milder attack.

41
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:54,196
That means the moment the symptoms come, the remedy comes and cures.

42
00:07:54,270 --> 00:08:08,046
It cures you from the beginning. This is totally different than saying that we give you a remedy

43
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:17,366
and you are protected from smallpox, from chicken pox, from whatever you like.

44
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,566
Or, we can protect everything by some people.

45
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:29,676
This is not so. Why? I will explain to you immediately.

46
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:42,946
You see the action of a remedy is when only the symptoms are similar to the remedy.

47
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:48,587
So you give a remedy, symptoms are similar, they are gone, cured.

48
00:08:50,320 --> 00:09:02,206
If the symptoms are not the same and you give a remedy totally out, what you give?

49
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:09,166
It's like giving a wrong medicine to a patient. What is going to happen? Nothing.

50
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:17,966
The patient comes back and says, I feel nothing. So this is the second possibility.

51
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:43,166
This is the second possibility. You give first, cured because it fits. Second possibility, you give, no effect.

52
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:50,336
How many patients will come back and say, I do not feel anything because you have given the wrong medicine.

53
00:09:50,410 --> 00:10:06,656
Third possibility is that you give a remedy that was close to the case and in such a case, you create a little bit of a disturbance.

54
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:15,660
That means either the symptoms have gone away for a while or you have a proving what is called proving of a remedy.

55
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:24,516
But when we say a proving of the remedy and we say to the people, come and have proving, don't be afraid.

56
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:36,376
What do we say? We say that this effect of the proving will go away within a month or two, finished.

57
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:47,536
You have no problem in doing it. We accept from the one side therefore that the action of a wrong remedy

58
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:58,046
you do a proving, is not your remedy. The action of the wrong remedy is only passing away if there is any effect at all.

59
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:15,024
So how can one maintain, claim that by giving you a remedy today, the next year when the epidemic will come

60
00:11:15,098 --> 00:11:22,646
you will be protected? And I said to them,
 if you have said this to some people

61
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:30,686
 and the epidemic comes and the child dies, what are you going to say?

62
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:42,166
We're going to say that all vaccinations are not 100%. So our vaccination also is not 100%.

63
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:56,166
You see how easy it is to get away from very logical arguments that can cause tremendous problems

64
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,446
for the prestige of Homeopathy.

65
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:07,240
By having these crazy ideas circulating.

66
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:24,326
I say ok, you want to try to protect. Wait until the epidemic is there, then find after your 10 first cases,

67
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:32,326
which are the remedies mostly running through the epidemic and you find out, oh this influenza is Gelsemium.

68
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:42,566
If you like you can give  Gelsemium, during the epidemic and if people develop symptoms of Gelsemium

69
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:51,176
then it will have very little effect because they will be taking the Gelsemium. But you cannot say, I will give you today

70
00:12:51,250 --> 00:13:01,220
 a Gelsemium and the influenza will not catch you next year or next month or whenever the epidemic comes.

71
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:19,726
Listen now the Times wrote: listen what these crazy people, voodoo people are saying that we have an alternative to vaccination.

72
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:31,566
Now let us come to the idea of the vaccination as it is practiced to the general medicine.

73
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:46,136
What is the idea? The idea is we introduce the vaccine, whatever is the epidemic and the organism is producing

74
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:56,656
antibodies which then can fight the real
epidemic when it comes. This is the idea.

75
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:11,006
In my book "The Science of Homeopathy", not everybody knows the book but it doesn't matter, you can read it later on,

76
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:27,686
there is a chapter on vaccination. I have written this book in 1976 and still this idea is valid today.

77
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:41,496
What I wrote during that time? I made a full analysis, who is going to be protected and how he's going to be protected.

78
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:57,476
I let you read it but I say only this. That if a person is really protected that means the vaccination brought down

79
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:07,726
 his immune system. It broke down the immune system and brought down his health and therefore

80
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:18,160
after that the specific epidemic cannot affect him.
Why? Because now you have made him chronically ill.

81
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:38,196
If you make a person chronically ill according to the teachings, he cannot anymore develop any infectious disease with high fever.

82
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:51,616
There is no power on the organism. Therefore when you take a case, you ask the patient

83
00:15:51,690 --> 00:16:02,476
when did you had last time a high fever? And you will see invariably in all these chronic cases,

84
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:11,946
they will say, 'a high fever I don't remember.
10 years ago, 15 years ago, 7 years ago.

85
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:25,420
Since that time the person who had the last high fever has entered a stage of chronic condition.

86
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:36,716
You may be surprised to see, this is an entirely new idea for Medicine. I understand.

87
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:50,306
Medicine does not know these things but I have seen again and again, when I treat a chronic case

88
00:16:50,380 --> 00:17:06,816
when the chronic case is really deep, severe, the person has stopped producing high fever many years ago.

89
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:18,206
A person with high blood pressure, what they call idiopathic blood pressure, that means a high blood pressure

90
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:34,726
 without knowing the cause. Not real cause. If this person you treat, tells you that last year I had a flu with 39 fever.

91
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:46,926
There is no danger and you can cure him. If the person with high blood pressure says, since 10 years ago

92
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:55,926
 I had my last fever then you're going to have a problem treating his blood pressure.

93
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:09,406
Because there are mechanisms inside the organism which we do not know that they allow or do not allow

94
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:17,256
the immune system to react to nosological,
to bacteria, microbes etc.

95
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:48,766
Not only that but you know the old times children, in the 60's in the 70's, the tonsillitis that was usually developing

96
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:59,606
 in the early stages were tonsillitis out of staphylococcal or streptococcal infections and the children

97
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:09,586
were bringing very high fever. Now these fevers were treated repeatedly by strong drugs

98
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:24,926
to the extent that today if you go to the intensive unit care, if you by chance something happen to you

99
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:41,766
and you enter the hospital, the intensive unit care, they will give you a triple antibiotic to prevent you

100
00:19:41,840 --> 00:20:04,510
from being infected from hospital microbes etc.
What the hell is going on? Nobody is inquiring.

101
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:19,966
 But according to my observation after 50 years that I'm practicing Homeopathy is that the organism has defense

102
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:27,680
 on different levels. If you break his defense on the upper level he will bring a defense on the lower level.

103
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:37,863
What we have managed to do with conventional vaccination? It is to bring down the general level of health

104
00:20:42,660 --> 00:21:03,686
of the western world, we brought it down and we do not get epidemics. The vaccination saved us from poliomyelitis,

105
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:17,560
 from smallpox, from all these diseases. The problem is instead of this what do we have today?

106
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:21,836
What kind of chronic conditions?

107
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:37,366
Instead of acute poliomyelitis, we have multiple sclerosis, we have neuromuscular diseases appearing.

108
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:44,596
Instead of smallpox we have autoimmune diseases.

109
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:56,206
And you say, ok George what shall we do, stop the vaccination?

110
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:03,446
What I want you first of all to understand is that Homeopathy does not have that possibility.

111
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:11,246
To make you so sick with the remedy that you cannot get the disease. This is a mechanism, a simple mechanism.

112
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:18,246
If you manage to bring down the organism then you will be protected  from acute diseases.

113
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:27,476
But you have to bring him down, to break down his defenses. You have to do it in order to protect.

114
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:37,786
Can Homeopathy claim to do this? Oh no. The only thing we can claim is during the epidemic to give a remedy.

115
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:47,526
The other is total craziness, nonsense and should not be publically claimed.

116
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:56,016
Where are the double blind tests to find out who was protected, who was not protected etc.

117
00:22:56,270 --> 00:23:05,675
And that makes me very angry. Why? Because it comes back to me. I'm dealing with Universities

118
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:11,690
and Medical Schools and say, what are you saying there?

119
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,976
Then you have some people who they say:

120
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:35,576
if we have a group we all agree to do a proving. Ok, I give you one dose of a remedy you don't know what.

121
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:45,576
And I collect afterwards the symptoms that this one dose has produced. And there are some people

122
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:58,730
who bring out a book with symptoms. Out of one dose of 30, they have been created 2000 symptoms!

123
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,776
Wait a moment.

124
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:07,806
We give wrong medicines every day,
the patients come back, they say no effect.

125
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:15,526
How it was that your medicine produced in everybody so many symptoms? How is this?

126
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:21,296
Don't you understand that this is a mass hysteria?

127
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:38,560
If I give you a remedy which is placebo, pure placebo, sugar, and I tell a friend:

128
00:24:38,634 --> 00:24:48,480
'you know what I gave them is radioactive material'.

129
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:58,176
And everybody hears, whispering, what's the remedy you took? Radioactive !

130
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:07,986
Oh my God! Oh I have a pain, my head, this, that, it's natural.

131
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:19,760
You take all these stupid hysterical reactions and you write it down as reactions to the remedy. For God's sake!

132
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:28,706
I said him, what are you doing? He said, you don't like provings.

133
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:40,116
I don't like provings? I like very much to have a proper proving. A proper proving is done properly.

134
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:47,275
That means first of all you prove a remedy with material doses.

135
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:54,286
Whatever you want to prove first you have to give it in material doses.

136
00:25:54,360 --> 00:26:09,080
Hahnemann never gave a high potency. All the provings are toxicology, poisonings and sub toxic doses.

137
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:24,106
In the Organon, Hahnemann wrote in par.146
 I can't remember the Aphorism.

138
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:34,606
'If you give a remedy and the person is sensitive to that remedy, you can give it in potency'.

139
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:42,666
But the person has to be sensitive to this particular remedy. If it is not sensitive, it's not going to have any symptom.

140
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:50,300
 So you give a remedy in 10 people and all of them were sensitive to this remedy? For God's sake.

141
00:26:50,680 --> 00:27:08,016
And then you bring out diamond, chocolate, whatever and then this is taken as information, put in the Repertory

142
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:20,930
 confusing the whole population of homeopaths. Totally confused because they believe in all these crazy things.

143
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:31,846
So you may ask, these substances do not have an affect? Yes of course they have an effect.

144
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:41,246
But if you give 2000 symptoms and the effect of this you have to chose the right symptoms.

145
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:48,620
Which out of the 2000 are the correct ones?
Total confusion.

146
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:57,566
 This is why I'm fighting again and again. George is against the new age and the new modern teachers.

147
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:05,826
I'm not against anybody. I'm against any nonsense which is going on in the name of Hahnemannian Homeopathy.

148
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:12,810
This has nothing to do with Homeopathy.

149
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:19,660
So coming back to the vaccination question.

150
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:41,360
 My idea is that certain people are prone to have a big reaction with the conventional vaccination.

151
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:53,126
And a lot of autistic children that we have today is the result of vaccinations.

152
00:28:53,200 --> 00:29:05,816
Therefore my idea is that before you vaccinate, find out whether that child complies with the parameters

153
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:16,660
that should tell you don't vaccinate that child. Because it's going to have a tremendous problem if you vaccinate it.

154
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:31,326
If we do research, we have the brains, we have the means to find out which are the parameters that will

155
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:39,326
not allow for a child to be vaccinated.
Otherwise the child will have a problem.

156
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:53,767
And then let these children, because the after effects of vaccinations if you weight them in the general population,

157
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:04,756
 let us say you vaccinate the whole 6 billion people living today. You manage to bring down their health.

158
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:20,396
What are you going to do? You are going to do a kind of creating a race which is going to be forever

159
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:34,966
 chronically ill more and more and more and more. And not healthy people will ever be left on this planet.

160
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:47,406
But they live longer now. Yes they live longer but what is the quality of life which we live?

161
00:30:50,890 --> 00:31:03,126
Is this quality of life that will live longer which brings us all these wars? Crazy minds?

162
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:18,576
They say we go to liberate Iraq from this big, satanic man, Sadam. Very good.

163
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:29,406
Put from CIA two people, shoot him and finished. No, we are going to conquer, we are going to throw bombs, clever bombs.

164
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:45,646
Kill hundreds of thousands and then put them one against the other to bring democracy.

165
00:31:48,490 --> 00:32:02,736
Are these minds healthy minds? Can you imagine if you have a child and somebody plans to send a bomb to kill your child?

166
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:26,196
This is what a healthy mind will think. That when I say bombard them and kill them, Rumsfeld or Kissinger,

167
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:39,336
the big master Kissinger says, ok bombard them, kill 300.000 of them, we don't need them.

168
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:54,186
Where is this bloody world is going and why?
If you search really in depth, you will see minds which are sick.

169
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:12,176
Sick minds. Can you imagine you have a neighbor who has two very nice children and you are thinking

170
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:28,126
 how to kill these children? Can you imagine? Can you say such a mind is healthy mind? It's not.

171
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:48,326
If somebody thinks in this way, everybody is sick, is mad. We don't say it for Rice, for Bush, for this or that but this is how they think.

172
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:57,206
They have a think tank and what they think is how to create wars, how to put each other against the other,

173
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:03,806
put the French against the Germans. Put the Germans against the Americans, put the Russians against these.

174
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:17,280
This is what they're thinking all the time.
Vaccinated, they are going to live very long for the glory of the planet.

175
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:37,286
Why do I say that? Because some of you, you are going to say, wait a moment. What are we doing?

176
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:44,336
We don't want to vaccinate until we find out if my child can be vaccinated.

177
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:50,046
Because if my child is going to be vaccinated and become autistic, I don't want it.

178
00:34:50,120 --> 00:35:06,816
If the epidemic comes and if it is his karma, let it have and then you treat the child, once the child is sick, you treat the child.

179
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:20,176
The argument is but the poliomyelitis was
 killing a lot of people and paralyzing etc.

180
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:29,310
Yes but they did not have Homeopathy.
They did not have any means to fight.

181
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:43,330
 But this is not homeoprophylaxis, it's homeocuring. It's curing with Homeopathy.

182
00:35:55,830 --> 00:36:05,826
-This makes me very pessimistic because they are actually vaccinating the whole world there are big programs going on all the time.

183
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:19,946
Even in the fishing industry they vaccinate even every single salmon. Each salmon is being vaccinated.

184
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:26,806
-The salmon? The fish?
-Yes, every one.

185
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,950
It's total craziness.

186
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:46,246
-I tell you something. One day you will eat a salmon and you will die. Because it's totally poisonous.

187
00:36:50,200 --> 00:37:08,886
Just listen to the news. There is a fish which is appearing that if you eat it, you die. In Mediterranean is appearing,

188
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:29,326
I cannot remember the type of the fish. They say it's so poisonous that if you eat the fish,

189
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:41,846
 if you fish and you catch this fish, throw
it back because if you eat you will die.

190
00:37:48,640 --> 00:38:07,036
A few years ago there were these oysters and one person, a friend of mine, he was looking and he saw all these open, dead.

191
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:33,366
What are we doing? Now they have Al Gore, he promotes global warming and prevention and they say,

192
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,446
in 10 years the world will be destroyed.

193
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:55,106
We reached 10 years out of 3,4,5, 30.000 along, in 10 years we're going almost to disappear. Why?

194
00:38:55,180 --> 00:39:03,560
Because of such things that we have admitted without thinking.

195
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:20,886
-Al Gore got the scientific facts mixed up I think, when he produced this film. It is estimated that human activity

196
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,126
 is only producing about 6% of the global warming.

197
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:30,386
The rest has to do with sun cycle changes and general heating up of the environment.

198
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:40,646
And the globalists are anchoring these talks about global warming caused by people to promote global carbon tax.

199
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:53,046
And I think in science, I've done some research, the fact is that carbon dioxide follows temperature change,

200
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:57,360
 it isn't the other way around as Al Gore claimed.

201
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:12,136
-If I understood you well you say that it is a natural cycle in the earth, one factor which is warming the planet

202
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:31,806
and the second is the activity from humans. And they calculate that this only 6%. How they can calculate it that it was 6%?

203
00:40:31,880 --> 00:41:05,026
I mean all this of course, Bush was in Kyoto 2 years ago and everybody agreed to reduce the pollution.

204
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:09,806
He said, no. America does not agree. Why?

205
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:20,871
Because he has been given an order from the industrialists in America. If you promote this, we are lost.

206
00:41:20,971 --> 00:41:31,026
Our economy will go down. So we cannot bring any measures. All the statistics for me it's organized by those people

207
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:42,446
who can organize and promote these things. What I see when I go to Delhi, to Athens, to Bombay

208
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:46,550
you see what happens, you can't even breath.

209
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:57,260
But anyhow until we understand maybe it will take some time.

210
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,686
-Knowing what you have discussed today and definitely I wouldn't want my child to be vaccinated

211
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:16,006
and if I take a stand, I'm not getting vaccinated and if it comes down with a disease, I'm going to prescribe.

212
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:23,766
And then you see that if vaccination is given, there are certain signs which will tell you that the child will react,

213
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:32,570
what would be those signs? Do we know which child is favorable to vaccination and which is not?

214
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:47,656
-Yes, that is what I say. We have to find out whether a child could be vaccinated and not have a dramatic effect on his health.

215
00:42:47,730 --> 00:43:01,586
There are certain signs that we can observe in a child, in which we say if the child has these signs, should be excluded.

216
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:10,406
There are some signs that we can find out if we really do research on this.

217
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:20,176
Find out which are the children. For instance, take all the autistic children which came after vaccination.

218
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:31,416
Take a very detailed report from the mother how the child was behaving before.
This is one research.

219
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:36,916
And you may find out that all these children had a common factor.

220
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:48,486
So you say let's see if this is responsible etc.
But today genetics have progressed quite a lot.

221
00:43:48,560 --> 00:44:00,346
If in the genes, in the DNA you find a predisposition for a neuro-muscular disorder like etc. etc.,

222
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:07,086
you must say this child should not take polio vaccination.

223
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:15,046
These kind of things, there are a lot of measures that can be taken.

224
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:21,046
-So what are the rules of the remedy that we say, after effects of vaccination?

225
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:31,976
-To bring back the balance, that means the person whom you treated it can be again infected by the disease

226
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:41,286
from which he was supposed to be protected.
If you really can cure him then you make him again

227
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:53,606
  sensitive to the original epidemic disease, from which he was supposed to be protected.

228
00:44:53,680 --> 00:45:05,286
These are facts. Whether we like it or not it's another story. These are the facts.

229
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:29,556
You imagine a world with healthy people and some of them have to die because of some weaknesses,

230
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:46,986
deficiencies in their immune system. Some of them they have to die, perhaps early. And all the others live in a healthy state.

231
00:45:51,200 --> 00:46:03,736
If you analyze why this phenomenon has happened? Save me, save my life, give me an injection.

232
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:14,406
Now is coming the bird flu. They sold out all the vaccinations, give me a vaccination to save my life from bird flu.

233
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:22,446
Nobody was actually falling down sick because we cannot be infected actually.

234
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:34,116
Behind all this is the fear of death.
Our fear of dying. Why?

235
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:45,766
Because we have not been educated at all what is the meaning of life and what is the meaning of death. We don't.

236
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:56,446
We know the unknown, 'I'm going to die, where I go?' and all these kind of things. Then you rush to save your life

237
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:02,370
 and on the rush you kill yourself.

238
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:18,576
Sometimes the patients rush to save their lives. I just had a person dying in Sweden and they wanted me

239
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:30,540
to treat and I said, come here but he is in the last days, he cannot travel because cancer is exploded all over.

240
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:46,516
This person tried to save his life. He took chemotherapy. Within a month he was finished.

241
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:54,087
He would be able to come here, if he had not take chemotherapy. Maybe Homeopathy could save him.

242
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:12,846
 They want me to save his life till 19 of June because he wants to marry a woman with whom he was in love.

243
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:28,056
And they have said, 19 of June will marry. And the wife said, please keep him alive till 19 of June, that means 3,4 days.

244
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:38,806
He is lying in bed exhausted and all that. And my e-mail was out of order for 2,3 days.

245
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:53,036
I could not answer because I only had his e-mail. But anyhow the rushing of taking the chemotherapy

246
00:48:53,110 --> 00:49:03,200
many times has exactly the opposite effect.
Does not save you. It just speeds up your end.

247
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,296
-But there are too few Homeopaths in the world.

248
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:17,806
-That is correct. That's why I'm trying to create more.

249
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:31,796
-I'm a veterinarian and I have stables with different horses to treat and it might be interesting

250
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:40,286
that there is one man who keeps about 40-50 horses and he does not vaccinate any of his horses, none.

251
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:54,586
And we have other stables, the horses do competitions all over the world and these horses are vaccinated every 6 months.

252
00:49:56,090 --> 00:50:05,586
It is very interesting for me to see the man with the 60 horses, who never vaccinates, he never has a problem with his horses.

253
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:15,616
Sometimes a little ulceration or wound but even there the horse heals. So we never go there.

254
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:23,596
He is doing nothing, just puts the horse on the field and we are almost never there.

255
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:33,099
With the other horses we have to treat them against cough, against bronchitis, against many, many different diseases.

256
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:41,646
This is very interesting for me because there is always problematic with the vaccination, what to do and what not.

257
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:45,976
People come and say, what shall I do, I have to vaccinate etc.

258
00:50:47,390 --> 00:51:00,376
-So you can see. I wrote a bird flu idea, in the website you can read it. I have chicken myself.

259
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:11,276
Once they were outside, no chicken ever died. How I decided to breed my own chicken?

260
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:24,676
Because in previous years somebody was coming selling little chicken, we buy the chicken and we put them in.

261
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:37,406
All of them died. First year, second year, third year all of them died. I said, forget it these people they keep alive

262
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:46,406
the chicken by giving constant antibiotics. The moment we take them, we don't give them anything, they just die.

263
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:54,416
I produce my own chicken.
Some of them may die if you close them.

264
00:51:54,490 --> 00:52:03,436
Last year they made us close the chicken, cover them, you could not have them outside.

265
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:07,936
Well, half of them died because they were closed.

266
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:19,156
The facts are coming cataclysmic. They are there all the facts to see.

267
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:27,736
But the big companies who are dealing with all these issues do not allow us to do anything.

268
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:50,766
Profit is the new God. The God of Americans is dollar and the whole world is stuck in this idea.

269
00:52:50,840 --> 00:53:05,896
If you have a lot of dollars, you made it. It's stupid. I have seen very unhappy people with a lot of money.

270
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:20,176
And I have seen very poor people, full of light, energy. In India their eyes are full of life and energy.

271
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:34,206
You know the story they propose to me millions to give prescriptions, just give 10 prescriptions for headache, PMS.

272
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:52,936
Just give us this combination and we'll give you 7.5 million. I said, no. He said, what car do you have?

273
00:53:53,010 --> 00:54:02,443
I had a VW, a small Volkswagen by that time. You should have a Rolls Royce.

274
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:16,706
I said, forget it. I don't want to go in my grave and have lots of dollars pressing me down.

275
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,540
This is crazy idea totally.

276
00:54:31,264 --> 00:54:42,040
- Arnica is routinely given to women in childbirth, before childbirth. Can you say if that is also wrong?

277
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:56,046
-Before childbirth may have a meaning in reducing the rigidity of the uterus.

278
00:54:57,610 --> 00:55:09,296
I would have suggested something else of course which is according to each organism, the remedy that needs.

279
00:55:09,370 --> 00:55:41,286
Many of you know that in Aedipsos where a Greek doctor was giving birth to twins and an American midwife

280
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:54,886
who was supposed to be very good approached her and is started the dilatation of the uterus and during this time

281
00:55:54,960 --> 00:56:03,296
 for stupid reason, he says, take Sepia 10M. From 10 o'clock in the morning who took Sepia, the uterus stayed like this.

282
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:20,036
 It didn't move anymore, it did a very nice proving of Sepia, because Sepia paralyses the uterus.

283
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:40,296
It makes the uterus collapse. 11, 12, 1, 2 o'clock, 5 o'clock and then we say, what shall we do there is no action.

284
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:54,506
Then I go there and I find out Sepia 10M was given at 10 o'clock. I said for what reason?

285
00:56:54,580 --> 00:57:07,246
She was a homeopath also. She said because she saw a mark here in my thigh and said this is a Sepia mark.

286
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:23,736
And she gave Sepia. By 9 o'clock in the night we were in a place where there was no surgery room

287
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:37,626
and only what we could find was a scissor of a woman who was doing stitching clothes.

288
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:46,046
In the hotel with the scissor and fortunately a German gynecologist.

289
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:59,126
I said, what shall we do? The helicopter could not come, there was no near any surgery and she had to deliver

290
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:10,386
when the uterus would not open. In the meantime I was teaching and the whole class knew.

291
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:17,846
Was any present at that time? George, you remember the dramatic moments?

292
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:29,126
I was informing the class, this is happening. At 9 o'clock I said, ok tell me the symptoms. She tells me the symptoms

293
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:40,176
and I see the remedy. Clear Pulsatilla symptoms. I give Pulsatilla and say, by 10 o'clock you will deliver.

294
00:58:42,530 --> 00:58:53,296
At 10 o'clock she started the spasms
and at a 10.15 the first child came out.

295
00:58:53,370 --> 00:59:09,226
The second was coming like that. He was putting his hand inside, trying to turn the child.

296
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:18,256
And at a certain moment he tells me the child is finished and I was drenched in sweat.

297
00:59:18,330 --> 00:59:29,406
This woman because of pain she was contracting the uterus and his hand was caught inside. He said, my hand,

298
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:41,676
give a remedy, give a remedy. I said Cuprum, I gave Cuprum and he takes out his hand. Then the woman

299
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:48,926
because of pain she was fainting. He said, don't let her faint.

300
00:59:50,090 --> 01:00:04,966
Give Carbo vegetabilis, she was coming back. Give this, give that. It was a terrible situation, why?

301
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:13,966
Because of stupid Sepia 10M at the wrong time for the wrong reasons.

302
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:24,650
The second child was saved.

303
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:41,230
Anyhow it's very dramatic things of my life.

304
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:48,966
-Back to homeoprophylaxis. I get a lot of patients who travel to Africa and Asia and they ask me about

305
01:00:49,040 --> 01:01:00,680
 travel vaccination and homeopathic prophylaxis. What is the best policy for these situations? The best advice we can give?

306
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:05,380
-The best advice? Don't go.

307
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:23,606
You know I have gone to India back in 63 I was going to India and everyone was saying, you go to India,

308
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:35,486
 you have to be vaccinated. For smallpox, yellow fever, cholera, 3-4 vaccinations. I said, forget it, I like to die in India.

309
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:45,926
I went to a doctor, can you give me a certificate that I'm vaccinated? He says, yes 10 pounds.

310
01:01:47,000 --> 01:02:00,596
Take 20. He gives me the certificate. I mean who is going to die. The fear that you may die but if your karma is

311
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:15,956
 to die in Africa or in India you accept this was your destiny. What is there so important about each one of us?

312
01:02:16,030 --> 01:02:21,835
We are so important we think the whole world will finish?

313
01:02:22,773 --> 01:02:37,707
Some people will cry for a while, nice man. That's all we are nothing. Why we should be afraid?

314
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:49,686
Maybe it's my character but I have not felt the fear. If I feel the fear because of some pathology will come to me,

315
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:59,176
 I speak differently but at this moment I don't understand this fear which comes because of pathology.

316
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:07,696
Because when I give the remedy, they say the fear is gone. So that fear is only pathology.

317
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:28,766
And people in India are not afraid of dying. I remember a case, the man left Bombay in order to go to die in Benares.

318
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:44,166
He says, good bye to his children, to his friends. Father where are you going? I'm going to Benares to die near Ganges.

319
01:03:48,080 --> 01:04:02,566
The man who was telling me was his son. He said I had to go with him and we arrived in Benares,

320
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:09,896
he was in good health, no real problem. We arrived and in Ganges

321
01:04:09,970 --> 01:04:24,310
 there are big steps going down to the river. As we descend down in the middle of the steps he collapsed and died.

322
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:37,396
What is better death than this? Because no fear,  because he was healthy he perceived I'm going to die.

323
01:04:37,470 --> 01:04:56,616
I remember my grand father, I was very young 6 or 7 and I heard him saying to my mother 'Maria

324
01:04:56,690 --> 01:05:05,080
I'm going to die in 3 days, don't worry'. She says, 'father what are you talking?'. I was listening.

325
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:20,766
I remember no doctor had come to the house, I couldn't remember anybody because he didn't have anything.

326
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:27,499
He only knew after 3 days he would die, he was 82, 83 I can't remember.

327
01:05:28,990 --> 01:05:45,236
2 days passed, the 3rd day he was actually praying, he was kneeling next to his bed, praying most of the time.

328
01:05:46,850 --> 01:05:58,256
The 3rd day he collapsed, he is finished and I heard the same story again and again. People who are healthy

329
01:05:58,330 --> 01:06:10,080
they are not afraid. Healthy in mental-emotional.
And they can predict when has arrived their time.

330
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:18,660
 Ok I accept and they go. Nice death.

331
01:06:29,150 --> 01:06:37,771
- About the wrong Sepia 10M, can you give us your idea of antidoting?

332
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:52,356
- In case you have given a wrong remedy, the wrong remedy cannot be antidoted immediately.

333
01:06:52,430 --> 01:06:58,836
Unless you do something very violent. You give some chemical drug very violent.

334
01:06:58,910 --> 01:07:06,566
They say, drink coffee yes. But if you drink coffee you have to drink coffee for 1 week to antidote.

335
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:11,079
But if you wait the effect will pass away by itself.

336
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:19,166
I could not wait in this time therefore I had to take the case and give the right remedy.

337
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:25,520
Once you give the right remedy is antidoted immediately, the wrong action.

338
01:07:34,990 --> 01:07:45,666
-Back to vaccination. Allopathic doctors and medical students have to be vaccinated, it's compulsory to hepatitis B

339
01:07:45,740 --> 01:07:52,876
and University students have to have meningitis. Otherwise you cannot go. So there is an alternative?

340
01:07:52,950 --> 01:08:08,816
-There is no alternative, no. Unless we all agree to bluff and say we have an alternative. If you give sugar

341
01:08:08,890 --> 01:08:18,046
 nothing will happen. They will not be affected.
Because there is no epidemic. Why?

342
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:26,286
 Because we are very sick to have an epidemic. Very few people are really healthy to get the epidemic.

343
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:37,806
And once I am the one who is healthy but all the other cannot get it, if I get it I cannot give it out.

344
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:50,756
Because most of the population is unhealthy and cannot spread. So the epidemic will be of a limited number.

345
01:08:50,830 --> 01:09:05,626
But watch out if we continue in this way, giving continuously a lot of vaccinations and changing the immune system,

346
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:18,406
 it's going to be a time when it will appear some microbes, bacteria, viruses which will be so virulent

347
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:23,406
that will take the life of millions, suddenly.

348
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:39,006
AIDS is one of them. The interesting thing is they say, broken down immune system.

349
01:09:41,170 --> 01:09:47,866
The AIDS means an immune system that has been broken down by what?

350
01:09:49,390 --> 01:09:59,166
By antibiotics, vaccinations and then AIDS comes.

351
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:08,236
I was treating a case of AIDS in Germany, some of you may remember and he was doing quite well.

352
01:10:08,310 --> 01:10:22,226
Actually I treated in London, who was in London? You remember this German man with Thuja? AIDS, I gave him Thuja

353
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:35,766
 and I said to him 'when did you last have Gonorrhea?'. He said 3 years ago. This is when it started,

354
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:51,796
the immune system developing AIDS. I gave Thuja and I predicted that this man will again be able to be infected

355
01:10:51,870 --> 01:11:10,596
 with Gonorrhea because he would continue have free sex and after that we will not be able to save him.

356
01:11:10,670 --> 01:11:24,286
I said it to the class, it's recorded in the video which they took all the videos and I don't know what they did with these.

357
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:33,046
And it was exactly like that. One year later he came for a follow up, he had been infected with gonorrhea again,

358
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:36,556
 he took antibiotics and back again.

359
01:11:38,910 --> 01:11:52,680
That means the immune system was uplifted by Thuja and now he was again prone to be infected with an infectious disease.

360
01:11:57,643 --> 01:12:08,536
-Just to clarify the Arnica story. We don't recommend Arnica before birth because may make the cervix less rigid

361
01:12:08,610 --> 01:12:13,206
but then we have at the same time the risk of bleeding.

362
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:29,866
-Yes, yes. Unless you chose the right remedy, you cannot make Homeopathy massive treatment.

363
01:12:29,940 --> 01:12:34,776
You have this you take that remedy,
you have that, you take that remedy.

364
01:12:37,390 --> 01:12:43,766
-Back again to this man with AIDS. What would have happened if you had treated the Gonorrhea homeopathically

365
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:47,726
and not with antibiotics?
Maybe he could have been saved?

366
01:12:47,800 --> 01:13:02,256
-He could be saved, yes. Because I knew his way of living, I said do you continue have free sex? Yes.

367
01:13:02,330 --> 01:13:12,486
How many times? Lots of times. With one, with another, I knew his mode of life so I said to the class,

368
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:23,246
I give him the remedy but this is going to happen. He will continue in the same way and he will be reinfected with Gonorrhea,

369
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:34,126
he will be treated by antibiotics, he will not tell me and then we're going to have a big problem again.

370
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:45,776
I treated this man, I continued to treat him in Celle, he was coming for a few years until I brought him to a state where

371
01:13:45,850 --> 01:13:55,476
he broke out with a very severe skin eruption.
That was in his face and body.

372
01:13:55,550 --> 01:14:08,646
 I said to him, this is very good. No medicine, wait. He said, yes but what about my face?

373
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:17,366
He wanted to look nice to continue with the sex behavior.

374
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:27,846
I don't look nice. I'm sorry I can do nothing for this at this moment, come after 6 months again.

375
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:43,476
He went, took cortisone and died in 6 months.
 He suppressed this, 6 months later he died.

376
01:14:49,120 --> 01:15:00,206
I want to read you something. It's very short from the British Medical Journal. This is British Medical Journal

377
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:19,826
14 of June 2007 concerning the vaccine
 Gardasil which is given to young girls.

378
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:41,526
To protect them from having cancer and this is a summary from a report in the British Medical Journal

379
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:46,290
and I would like read it to you very fast.

380
01:15:47,020 --> 01:16:00,876
The HPV vaccine which is being given to girls age 11-12 to prevent cervical cancer in later life maybe a killer.

381
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:21,396
So far 3 young girls have died after being vaccinated. And there have been 1.637 adverse reactions reported

382
01:16:21,470 --> 01:16:42,366
 in less than a year. Nevermind the unreported and continues: in Australia 25 girls at the same school

383
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:53,926
 who had been given their first HPV vaccine last month, experienced headache, nausea and 4 of them

384
01:16:54,000 --> 01:17:02,600
 ended in the hospital. Otherwise there are no side effects.

385
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:23,286
The vaccine Gardazil has controversy since it was approved for use last year.

386
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:36,126
Some States in the USA have decided to make the vaccine compulsory which has caused an outcry among

387
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:45,910
 parents who see the vaccine as a license
for sexual relationships outside of marriage.

388
01:17:48,510 --> 01:17:56,456
The theme I was talking yesterday, sexual liberation and I will add a few things now.

389
01:17:56,530 --> 01:18:07,926
Gardazil is supposed to protect against human papillomavirus type 6,11,16 and 18 which cause most

390
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:21,806
cervical cancers and genital warts. A public interest group discovered the extend of the adverse

391
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:32,406
reactions only when they make a request to the Food and Drug Administration under the freedom of information act.

392
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:42,096
Presumably the FDA would have preferred to have stayed silent rather than alert the public about a vaccine

393
01:18:42,170 --> 01:18:51,396
 that may need more safety trials. I will give you a copy in each one of you, you will get a copy to have it

394
01:18:51,470 --> 01:18:57,236
and give it to your patients when they ask you about .

395
01:18:57,310 --> 01:19:04,960
You say the British Medical Journal they say so, we don't know, we don't know anything.

396
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:39,246
- In Texas the HPV vaccine is being given in 3 different shots. Each shot is almost 300 dollars. Merck has produced

397
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:45,106
 this vaccine and a lot of people tell me that Merck win thousands dollars from this.

398
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:51,566
They've been sued for billions over Vioxx,
and I think they're trying to regroup with Gardasil.

399
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:56,356
-Exactly this is the idea. This has been written in the Internet.

400
01:19:56,430 --> 01:20:03,646
-One more thing George. There are over 120 varieties of HPV. It only covers 4.

401
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:16,146
-But the selling of the vaccine will cover all the previous loss of the pharmaceutical industry.

402
01:20:19,470 --> 01:20:28,126
-We were talking yesterday about ways to find symptoms to help parents to realize if their children are sensitive

403
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:36,806
or not to the vaccines. If we go to the Repertory, general vaccination elements after, we find a few remedies.

404
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:48,596
Could a homeopath help a parent by saying your child looks to me Silica for example. The parent brings the child to the homeopath.

405
01:20:48,670 --> 01:20:54,106
-No, no, no.
-I'm saying could we use the picture of Silica to say to the parent...

406
01:20:54,180 --> 01:21:01,246
-No. There are Silicas which are very healthy, Silicas which are very ill. You cannot say Silica.

407
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:07,326
The Silica can be a very healthy child, just needs some perspiration and that's all and there is

408
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,506
another one who cannot drag her feet.

409
01:21:09,580 --> 01:21:13,086
-I say if we can say that Silica children are more sensitive than others.

410
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:16,846
-No we cannot say that. This is what I say.

411
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:23,345
-I'm so happy that you mention this today because I was going to bring it up yesterday.

412
01:21:23,445 --> 01:21:31,086
In Denmark one of my patients she is 22 at University and she was paid to be vaccinated.

413
01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:39,006
And after 3 vaccinations where she made money for studies, she was in a steady relationship the whole time,

414
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:46,910
they say this vaccine is wonderful, it works.
You have not got Chlamydia in the past 1,5 year

415
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:55,680
But she got 3 cancerous cells in the uterus during that time. And Homeopathy took it away again.

416
01:21:57,020 --> 01:22:00,216
-Are you a medical doctor?
-No, I'm just a classical homeopath.

417
01:22:00,290 --> 01:22:09,606
-So you have to find a medical doctor to send a report on this case and say she was there,

418
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:12,286
she was paid and this is what has happened.

419
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:21,616
-Yes I will when I go home but the horrible thing is that the marketing is saying 'you don't want your

420
01:22:21,690 --> 01:22:28,092
 child to die of cancer do you?' but it's the chlamydia thing.

421
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:38,206
-We know the tricks. But people are becoming more and more intelligent.

422
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:47,316
Before we go further I wanted to clarify one thing about yesterday talk.

423
01:22:47,390 --> 01:22:56,816
You maybe thinking that I'm coming from religious family or religious dogma or whatever.

424
01:22:56,890 --> 01:23:09,826
I have nothing to do with any kind of religion. What I understand from experience is that sexual power is a very

425
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:25,126
 powerful energy we have and if we misuse it, if we overuse it, if we don't use it with wisdom is going to have

426
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:37,646
 an effect on the health. You cannot imagine how many times the misuse of this power has brought about the

427
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:56,886
demise of the individual. I will only give you an example. In Africa if you take world statistics, you will see the deaths

428
01:23:57,060 --> 01:24:11,900
of the African people first are deaths from venereal diseases due to sexual liberation. You see this idea of being liberated

429
01:24:14,820 --> 01:24:24,286
 or being democratic or being not suppressive what has brought about? The demise.

430
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:31,526
The African people are going to disappear. Do you know that? From AIDS, Gonorrhea and Syphilis.

431
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:39,636
Deaths from Gonorrhea and Syphilis a few years ago were the highest in Africa.

432
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:50,366
And it is not a matter of preaching here, it is only a matter of health.

433
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:56,816
What I know I tell you. This is my experience. You do whatever you like, you advice your patients,

434
01:24:56,890 --> 01:25:01,396
 your children the way you like.
But this is what I know.

435
01:25:01,470 --> 01:25:14,246
And then if you tell me by suppressing this energy, are you going to have also side effects? The answer is yes.

436
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:30,840
But the side effects from suppression is going to be minimal in comparison with sexual liberation  where you have all this.

437
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:44,446
 HPV, warts and Condylomata and Chlamydia and all the sexually transmitted diseases.

438
01:25:46,290 --> 01:25:59,016
It's not only that. It is that if you allow your child, your patient from a young age to go into having sexual relationships,

439
01:25:59,090 --> 01:26:08,856
they cannot anymore fall in love later on and enjoy. They lose the enjoyment of being really in love.  That's all.

440
01:26:08,930 --> 01:26:21,925
 I say don't do that because you will never enjoy life. You say 'I want to kill myself.  I don't like to live' etc. Why?

441
01:26:23,140 --> 01:26:40,966
 Because you abuse this power in very early age. But the mentality of mothers  sometimes is why don't you become a whore?

442
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:51,068
Go out, find a friend', 12 years old girl in America go and find a boyfriend. 'You don't have a boyfriend? You are sick'.

443
01:26:52,850 --> 01:27:03,168
12,13,14 years. I say, what are you talking madam? But this is the education.
