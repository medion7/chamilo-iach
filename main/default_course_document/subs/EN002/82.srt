1
00:00:26,501 --> 00:00:27,417
Thank you.

2
00:00:30,623 --> 00:00:35,559
If the Germans applaud that means the job is done.

3
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:55,575
I received this morning at about 4-5 a.m. an email which I’d like to read it to you.

4
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:12,408
You may be surprised I was working at 4 a.m. but I have remained so much back with the emails that I have to get up very early.

5
00:01:14,673 --> 00:01:17,191
So, I don’t have much time for sleep.

6
00:01:22,751 --> 00:01:49,343
Maybe some of you remember that according to the model which I presented to you I said that fever is a good sign as long as there was no fever before, now there is fever.

7
00:01:50,855 --> 00:02:11,879
But also you remember that I have said that in the very end stage of life of a person usually appears a high fever which is the final stage.

8
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:40,497
Who remembers that? Who heard this for the first time? I want to see some hands! Only 2 people? I will tell you now the story.

9
00:02:42,191 --> 00:03:29,281
One of the students, an Indian lady, she is the oldest of the group from India, she got up during the lecture and she thanked me very much saying that for 2 years her mother was treated by me without me knowing her, the information was sent to me by her.

10
00:03:31,401 --> 00:03:43,841
She was treated and how happy she was because the doctors 2 years ago had given her mother a few days more to live.

11
00:03:44,656 --> 00:03:50,528
So she had lived another 2 years.

12
00:03:55,537 --> 00:04:05,961
Her mother must have been around 80 I can’t remember now the exact age and she thanked me and she was crying…

13
00:04:20,721 --> 00:04:35,537
What was interesting with this case it was that every time she would give me some information about her, symptoms changed and I prescribed another remedy.

14
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:57,584
That means in 2 years I had prescribed 10 remedies or more because symptoms were changing so as you know in the end stages of diseases there is no possibility for a cure.

15
00:04:58,353 --> 00:05:08,521
What you can do is ameliorate the symptoms so the lady was suffering because she was full of cancer in the lungs, couldn’t breathe,

16
00:05:10,456 --> 00:05:18,784
terrible situation in the beginning but got better and better. But still no cure.

17
00:05:21,913 --> 00:05:25,465
This morning I received this email, I am going to read you.

18
00:05:26,848 --> 00:05:41,121
She says on Saturday, 4 days ago, I came to know my mother had fever of 40,3 C.

19
00:05:45,184 --> 00:05:49,056
When I read this I did not need to read the rest.

20
00:05:50,025 --> 00:05:55,841
I knew what would follow. Now you listen what followed.

21
00:05:56,945 --> 00:06:09,953
The lady was taking care of her told me the fever came suddenly and she was given Belladonna 200C.

22
00:06:15,145 --> 00:06:25,329
I reached Hyderabad (the Indian town where her mother was) on Sunday evening.

23
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:34,137
No fever after Belladonna but she was not breathing well.

24
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:47,281
She had a person fanning her and gave Carbo vegetabilis.

25
00:06:52,656 --> 00:06:57,195
She settled down, the lady became quieter.

26
00:07:01,177 --> 00:07:17,017
She checked on her at 3 a.m. she found that the old lady was restless and there was burning pain with some eruption.

27
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:21,065
The treatment had brought about some eruptions.

28
00:07:24,825 --> 00:07:47,984
Gave her Arsenicum 30C and on Monday morning, listen to that, she enjoyed her hot drink,  brushed her teeth, went to the commode,

29
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:59,321
washed herself and after the bath asked for something to drink.

30
00:08:02,225 --> 00:08:26,936
By 12.00 in the noon breathing became very difficult with great restlessness, gave her Arsenicum 200C she felt good and said to her that she was feeling better.

31
00:08:28,281 --> 00:08:40,881
Slowly, with full consciousness and peace she passed away at 3 p.m.

32
00:08:42,704 --> 00:08:52,001
I sat with her holding her hand and she asked me to pray for her.

33
00:08:53,873 --> 00:08:57,392
It was a beautiful moment for me.

34
00:09:01,681 --> 00:09:18,825
Your teaching prepared me to know that the high temperature meant that the time had come. Thank you, sir.

35
00:09:21,681 --> 00:09:27,761
This is a different kind of medicine that we are teaching here.

36
00:09:28,905 --> 00:09:35,152
It’s another aspect of medicine.

37
00:09:36,681 --> 00:09:45,650
Let us suppose the lady had antibiotics for this high fever.

38
00:09:46,489 --> 00:10:00,817
What would antibiotics have done? Would have sent her straight to coma state, become a vegetable and live 10 more days in comatose state

39
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:12,833
instead of being peaceful, understanding what was coming on, she said to the daughter please pray and left.

40
00:10:15,257 --> 00:10:29,353
This is the beauty of Homeopathy as long as we understand what to do, how to do it and don’t think...

41
00:10:31,057 --> 00:10:33,745
it’s difficult, I cannot do it.

42
00:10:34,185 --> 00:10:44,649
Try and you will see the difference between all kinds of medication.

43
00:10:45,362 --> 00:10:52,657
They’ll be soon talking about that and classical Homeopathy according to the symptoms.

44
00:10:53,041 --> 00:11:03,225
Carbo vegetabilis. It soothed her down and then Arsenicum 30C and then 200C.

45
00:11:06,521 --> 00:11:18,594
Every case that I have seen going through the last stages they have the same story.

46
00:11:19,785 --> 00:11:36,585
Peacefully passing to the next state which almost never happens under heavy drugging. There pains.

47
00:11:39,017 --> 00:11:50,745
Some suffering is there because a lady with metastasis where she is ready to die and they say she has 3 more days to live, take her home

48
00:11:52,320 --> 00:12:05,897
and she lives for another 2 years quite comfortably. It’s what Homeopathy can offer in the last stages.

49
00:12:07,169 --> 00:12:24,952
For those who have read my book “The science of Homeopathy”, it was written in 1976- 1978.

50
00:12:29,408 --> 00:12:43,712
There is chapter on euthanasia, go back and read this chapter and you will see what I had already realize during that time concerning Homeopathy

51
00:12:45,608 --> 00:13:05,633
and how Homeopathy could help the dying patient to go on the transition with maximum awareness and minimum suffering.

52
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:13,105
I have already written a chapter in 1976.

53
00:13:17,904 --> 00:13:33,489
It took 40 years from 1976. I waited. The world would understand.

54
00:13:41,849 --> 00:13:51,858
You are responsible now because you are the ones that know.

55
00:13:56,464 --> 00:14:06,897
I will see your actions. I want to say a few more things.

56
00:14:17,017 --> 00:14:34,217
This is an idea which shows the necessary conditions for the potencies.

57
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:44,753
When a potency has to be high and when it has to be low.

58
00:14:52,081 --> 00:15:04,546
Many times people who are accusing me say that George doesn’t accept any other therapy or anything else.

59
00:15:04,818 --> 00:15:06,266
That is wrong.

60
00:15:06,938 --> 00:15:16,066
George simply knows what each therapy can do and I have been giving this information.

61
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:49,546
In this diagram it shows in the bottom part “Herbs, vitamins, minerals, allopathic drugs” and all kinds of medical drugs,

62
00:15:50,849 --> 00:16:07,521
all kinds of substances, anyone who comes up with any idea. “Lemon is good for this” etc.

63
00:16:09,641 --> 00:16:28,505
All these ideas with material medicine belong to the physical, material part of the body.

64
00:16:30,434 --> 00:16:41,194
It’s a material medicine which affects the body materially.

65
00:16:42,929 --> 00:17:01,001
So if your body doesn’t assimilate well the magnesium, you may give magnesium or selenium or zinc or a mineral as a supplement.

66
00:17:03,714 --> 00:17:06,538
You may give a vitamin.

67
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:19,938
You may give a supplement when the thyroid is not working, you give thyrhormone and the person continues.

68
00:17:22,706 --> 00:17:31,961
When your body cannot produce insulin, you give insulin so digestion can continue.

69
00:17:34,609 --> 00:17:46,617
In the same way cortisone is also a hormone of the body which is needed for defense and they misuse that.

70
00:17:48,314 --> 00:17:52,081
They don’t even know how to use cortisone.

71
00:17:55,025 --> 00:18:04,080
I think they are giving huge doses of cortisone suddenly.

72
00:18:09,634 --> 00:18:20,657
When you give a huge dose of cortisone in somebody you stop his own production of cortisone totally.

73
00:18:22,209 --> 00:18:33,770
Instead of giving a supplement and wait a little bit, give some time to the organism, the organism doesn’t produce enough cortisone,

74
00:18:35,346 --> 00:18:46,978
give a supplement, give a little bit and then increase the doses slowly so you let the organism produce as much cortisone as it can

75
00:18:47,689 --> 00:19:01,513
and supplement just a little bit more if it is needed and then you will not have this tragic cases of cortisone poisoning.

76
00:19:03,849 --> 00:19:12,008
I think they are using their own tools in a bad way.

77
00:19:15,649 --> 00:19:17,505
Enough with cortisone.

78
00:19:18,673 --> 00:19:30,545
It’s drug we do not like because it is very powerful because it concerns itself with the defense mechanism.

79
00:19:31,353 --> 00:19:44,418
The moment that you strengthen this you suppress all other symptoms, you have no other symptoms to go guide you to the remedy.

80
00:19:50,545 --> 00:20:01,371
Therefore stay away from cortisone because once
the organism is used to have external cortisone

81
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:09,379
replacing our own suprarenal glands stop working
and they do not produce cortisone anymore.

82
00:20:10,884 --> 00:20:14,075
So you have to give it for the rest of his life.

83
00:20:14,643 --> 00:20:20,155
That’s why they say once you start cortisone then you have to take it constantly.

84
00:20:23,508 --> 00:20:38,548
All these drugs and supplements will act on the physical body that means on the electro-chemical structure of the body.

85
00:20:43,028 --> 00:20:50,885
Because they act on the material body they will act with everyone.

86
00:21:05,684 --> 00:21:27,452
If you have a problem with your liver and somebody tells you the liver needs this supplement, herbs, makes up 4-5 herbs and give it to persons

87
00:21:28,124 --> 00:21:32,691
who have liver problem, everyone will be affected.

88
00:21:41,844 --> 00:22:07,872
The idea of this diagram is that here on this area whatever you are giving it will affect everybody, in this area, right to the top, there, there,

89
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:17,912
there’s only one remedy and has to be absolutely correct.

90
00:22:18,544 --> 00:22:22,545
You have no place to play around.

91
00:22:23,737 --> 00:22:27,616
You have to be absolutely correct with the similimum.

92
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:31,048
Then you can give a high potency.

93
00:22:32,328 --> 00:22:44,416
The picture is clear, the pathology is not gross, you can go and give it.

94
00:22:44,784 --> 00:22:48,224
But you have to be very accurate, to the point.

95
00:22:49,976 --> 00:23:05,122
As you go down the limits to which you are limited are broadening.

96
00:23:08,432 --> 00:23:11,232
There’s a big secret here.

97
00:23:14,401 --> 00:23:27,519
The secret is that as you go higher and higher you have to be more and more accurate in order to have an effect

98
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:53,302
but at the same time if you have a 12X or 6X these will work on this area.

99
00:23:54,926 --> 00:24:03,517
So it will catch a lot more people that a high potency.

100
00:24:05,766 --> 00:24:14,902
So the people who are giving mixtures of remedies, polypharmacists, low potencies, they have some effect

101
00:24:17,551 --> 00:24:25,215
and this is much easier that trying to find the uppermost remedy.

102
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:46,415
What is the problem? Chronic headaches, liver
cirrhosis or fatty degeneration, kidney problem

103
00:24:47,815 --> 00:24:58,303
then we know a few remedies that affect more
or less the liver or the headaches etc.

104
00:24:58,943 --> 00:25:11,944
Put them together in low potency and we have a specialty and we sell this and we say that it is a good specialty for fever or for whatever.

105
00:25:16,664 --> 00:25:20,807
This is easy and it is effective.

106
00:25:21,431 --> 00:25:41,239
That’s why they tell me George please leave us alone, we are happy, we have some effect with mixtures of remedies etc.

107
00:25:41,615 --> 00:26:05,095
Why do we bother? The reason is when you have a case like this, when you have 3 or 4 layers already when you started the case,

108
00:26:06,568 --> 00:26:13,599
try in such a case to give mixtures of remedies.

109
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:34,583
What would you observe in this case? Something which is very important; you observe that the red line which is the uppermost, its peak,

110
00:26:36,591 --> 00:27:01,446
it represents one symptom, but what you observe is from the second layer, the yellow, there are 3 symptoms coming from the lower level

111
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:20,023
which is underneath and these 3 symptoms (which may be not 3 but 10 or 12) will manifest after the first layer is gone,

112
00:27:20,895 --> 00:27:37,047
then when the second layer is coming up they will manifest much more clearly together with the rest of the symptoms indicating a remedy.

113
00:27:37,431 --> 00:27:51,839
But still there are few symptoms coming from the third layer pointing through the yellow and also from the fourth layer.

114
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:02,823
From the fourth layer there is a symptom that stays all along.

115
00:28:05,456 --> 00:28:17,888
I’ll give you an example; you treat somebody with obsessive neurosis.

116
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:30,247
One of his/her symptoms is severe constipation.

117
00:28:36,255 --> 00:28:57,783
It may have started when the patient was 12 years old together with her menses and after this the patient was treated for an acute,

118
00:29:00,432 --> 00:29:12,784
a bronchitis or pneumonia, with antibiotics, the constipation became even worse, the antibiotics affected the person

119
00:29:13,648 --> 00:29:24,560
and anxiety started developing, it was treated when she was 17 or 19.

120
00:29:33,264 --> 00:29:48,544
The anxiety was treated and with some anxiolytic drugs and eventually the panic attacks manifested and the panic attacks presented

121
00:29:49,352 --> 00:30:02,656
and treated with drugs and then the person became psychotic.

122
00:30:04,255 --> 00:30:21,711
You are treating this person and as you go along from depression and mental confusion then it comes to less confusion

123
00:30:23,023 --> 00:30:38,279
but once the layers are the one on the top of the other then as you go and take out the layers you find out that the original constipation remained

124
00:30:38,959 --> 00:31:01,839
till the end and after the fifth remedy together with some other symptoms… But as you take away the layers the whole organism is on a higher level.

125
00:31:08,056 --> 00:31:17,192
You take the third layer out… You cannot take it out.

126
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,008
It’s difficult.

127
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:23,047
So you have treated the 2 layers correctly.

128
00:31:23,495 --> 00:31:33,496
The person is doing quite well but here is coming a stress.

129
00:31:46,983 --> 00:31:53,839
While you have two layers remaining for treatment there comes an acute.

130
00:31:55,168 --> 00:32:12,119
Somebody lost her boyfriend, a love affair, somebody had a severe acute, some others had some stress

131
00:32:12,464 --> 00:32:42,584
because the condition in their environment became very intolerable, they are suffocating and somebody has lifted a very heavy weight and a new situation was formed.

132
00:32:44,048 --> 00:32:51,263
Then you cannot go to treat the third layer.

133
00:32:52,527 --> 00:33:08,383
You first treat the damage that was done by the stress and get rid of that so that the third layer eventually will appear.

134
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,088
Another example.

135
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:33,472
Let’s say you have been treating an endogenous depression, deep depression and you gave one remedy Aurum,

136
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:51,936
it’s better Natrum muriaticum, it’s better and there is a stress on that person and you see the vertigo starting which looks like Meniere’s disease.

137
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:23,007
And the third layer was supposed to be Calcarea carbonica and it has this vertigo but the details of the vertigo look more like Conium.

138
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:33,912
So you have to give first Conium and then Calcarea carbonica will manifest again clearly as a third layer.

139
00:34:35,799 --> 00:34:40,063
But first you have to give not Calcarea carbonica but Conium.

140
00:34:48,968 --> 00:35:10,887
So eventually you treated the third level and there is a jump in the energy, happiness and joy of life.

141
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:34,008
If the joy of life comes you better stop treating! This is the deepest, the most important for the human being.

142
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:42,815
You will understand what I mean.

143
00:35:46,799 --> 00:36:19,015
Can you imagine a person who is really in love, full of happiness, thinking of her boyfriend and the meeting is fantastic.

144
00:36:21,384 --> 00:36:46,560
Can you imagine such a person doing wrong, having hatred, negative emotions? That joy of life doesn’t allow you to think.

145
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:56,880
You forgive even your enemies… You don’t even think about it.

146
00:36:58,456 --> 00:37:23,120
Most probably some of you have been through that period when you were 12-13-14 because it’s a state of innocence.

147
00:37:25,216 --> 00:37:27,599
Joy is state of innocence.

148
00:37:28,047 --> 00:37:32,600
You have to be innocent in order to feel joy.

149
00:37:36,496 --> 00:37:53,696
Unless you are really innocent the conscience which is always there watching says you are not clear there,

150
00:37:54,544 --> 00:38:08,760
you cannot be happy, you are not allowed to be happy, you are not allowed to enjoy because you have done this and that.

151
00:38:09,816 --> 00:38:11,288
Usually they don’t know.

152
00:38:12,672 --> 00:38:18,880
We have done so many bad things that we don’t know we have done this and that.

153
00:38:20,144 --> 00:38:23,199
If we knew we could do something.

154
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:40,391
We do so many wrong things in our lives that we are overloaded with negative experiences and emotions and the joy is lost.

155
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:44,976
So you  get the remedy and then the joy comes.

156
00:38:46,552 --> 00:39:04,512
Then you say be careful now because you have to replace all the damage you have done in your life in order to keep it otherwise will not remain for long.

157
00:39:09,952 --> 00:39:25,784
So Homeopathy will give you the possibility to clear up the subconscious which is overloaded with all the negative experiences

158
00:39:29,264 --> 00:39:38,695
but during the time you are feeling so happy then you can do no wrong.

159
00:39:41,208 --> 00:39:57,568
Can you imagine the world with happy people? Do you know the think tanks there exists? Do you know what it is?

160
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:17,792
A think tank is a group of people who are constantly busy thinking how we will enslave others.

161
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:53,048
How we can make other work for us but they will not get anything but bread, football, movies etc.

162
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:12,512
My football team has won! They can kill at this moment.

163
00:41:15,343 --> 00:41:25,312
They have so much energy generated and they feel a rude happiness.

164
00:41:30,344 --> 00:41:32,599
It’s not subtle happiness.

165
00:41:34,056 --> 00:41:39,784
For a moment. And they next day they’re back to depression.

166
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:54,376
If Homeopathy can give the possibility of somebody to be in a happy state that’s the end.

167
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:07,409
You have done your duty even if there still is some pathology that remains.

168
00:42:18,504 --> 00:42:39,976
In incurable cases people can be happy that means in the mental/ emotional site a person can be clear and cured

169
00:42:41,015 --> 00:42:45,408
and all the problems can come to the physical body.

170
00:42:48,336 --> 00:42:56,800
You see a pathology which is quite heavy but then the joy returns.

171
00:43:08,952 --> 00:43:23,112
Let’s get back again. Red line.

172
00:43:23,872 --> 00:43:33,016
You have made a mistake because you took into consideration 5 symptoms that do not belong to this, like the green, the yellow

173
00:43:33,456 --> 00:43:40,679
and the blue because some symptoms are peaking up and you pick them in the taking of the case.

174
00:43:41,336 --> 00:43:54,512
So you pick up symptoms from underneath and you gave a wrong remedy but you are a good prescriber so your remedy is quite close.

175
00:43:56,279 --> 00:44:14,759
This good remedy that you gave what will do? Will modify the uppermost layer that means some do the symptoms will go away,

176
00:44:15,279 --> 00:44:26,967
some others will stay but actually no progress. It’s a modification.

177
00:44:27,335 --> 00:44:31,231
Then you give another but you know what happens.

178
00:44:33,576 --> 00:44:50,208
If you insist on this way of treating, the wrong remedy that you will give or it will appear to be the wrong remedy will push the symptoms of the right remedy

179
00:44:50,904 --> 00:45:02,489
more to the fore and the next time will give you a clearer idea of the layer and then you give the remedy and then the layer is gone.

180
00:45:06,935 --> 00:45:17,216
During this process of taking away a layer actually there is a possibility that one of these layers

181
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:38,023
which has been created by the genetic predisposition of the parents who gave you this predisposition, this uppermost layer

182
00:45:39,047 --> 00:45:56,215
which comes from what we may call predisposition to tuberculosis it may go away not with one remedy but with 3 remedies.

183
00:45:57,767 --> 00:46:10,784
3 remedies to take away the tubercular or the syphilitic or the sycotic predisposition.

184
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:33,479
If you are observing carefully you may have given Aurum as the first remedy which is mostly a syphilitic remedy and the next thing

185
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:46,463
that you will find is again a syphilitic remedy which is Mercury as a second remedy or Syphilinum.

186
00:46:49,799 --> 00:47:00,720
After Mercury or Syphilinum then you see the sycotic remedy; Thuja, Medorrhinum or Nat-s.

187
00:47:02,456 --> 00:47:06,407
You don’t have to think in this way.

188
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:20,116
Because if you think according to miasms, it’s mechanical, most probably you will make a mistake.

189
00:47:20,876 --> 00:47:25,467
You have to go by the symptoms at the moment.

190
00:47:26,148 --> 00:47:32,148
This is the greatest secret. Don’t use mechanical ideas.

191
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:42,964
Detoxification of the organism, we find a formula to detoxify you… This is nonsense.

192
00:47:44,379 --> 00:47:50,523
The detoxification formula contains Nux-v., Sep., Calc….

193
00:47:51,188 --> 00:47:56,795
Of course, one of these remedies may be your remedy so it will have some effect.

194
00:48:06,212 --> 00:48:18,900
The more the whole organism goes higher the more you are allowed to give a high potency.

195
00:48:24,164 --> 00:48:33,923
In the beginning when you have a deep pathology, it’s not clear, it’s better to go with low potency.

196
00:48:35,059 --> 00:48:43,059
It will do something because it will catch much more 12th potency will act more or less on these levels.

197
00:49:05,412 --> 00:49:13,844
Your remedy that is very low will affect quite a lot of cases.

198
00:49:15,748 --> 00:49:19,652
You do not have to be so absolutely correct.

199
00:49:20,908 --> 00:49:30,740
When you are on the box there you have the supplements everybody will be affected but also you have to be careful

200
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:41,195
because maybe the person who you think needs this supplement has it in excess.

201
00:49:41,627 --> 00:49:46,811
If Kalium is in excess and you give it you will damage him.

202
00:49:47,637 --> 00:49:56,172
That’s why from time to time people come out and say do not give a lot of vitamins, maybe it’s dangerous.

203
00:49:58,275 --> 00:50:02,555
Don’t give a lot of cortisone because it’s dangerous etc.

204
00:50:07,828 --> 00:50:15,012
If you give a lot of insulin you’ll have a coma state.

205
00:50:19,923 --> 00:50:26,211
It will affect everyone who has a problem with his pancreas.

206
00:50:27,493 --> 00:50:37,204
But if you give it too high you send him in hypoglycemic coma.

207
00:50:44,764 --> 00:50:53,715
Even in this basic box there you have to be careful, if you want to use such supplements.

208
00:51:01,836 --> 00:51:24,964
Who is perspiring here? Who feels comfortable? This is the idea when you take a case.

209
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:40,956
You have to find what the normal is and whether the symptoms are much beyond the norm.

210
00:51:41,772 --> 00:51:54,852
Because a person under heat situation will perspire but how much will he suffer from that? It’s important to write down.

211
00:52:04,451 --> 00:52:06,995
Don’t write it as a symptom of mine.

212
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,828
I don’t know myself so what about you…

213
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:20,731
- I have a question related to this chart about the potencies.

214
00:52:21,091 --> 00:52:36,099
What about LM potencies in this chart?
- LM potencies are low potencies.

215
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:44,541
I consider them as low potencies and I do not consider them as powerful ones.

216
00:52:45,165 --> 00:52:59,757
Therefore the first law is you have to repeat them every day 2-3 times in order to be effective that means the potency is not very strong.

217
00:53:02,493 --> 00:53:11,662
LM1, LM2, LM3, LM5 but the difference is very small I believe.

218
00:53:11,998 --> 00:53:25,926
I don’t have much experience but I would consider them to have the same position as low potencies on the centesimal scale.

219
00:53:28,542 --> 00:53:36,141
All low potencies need to be repeated.

220
00:53:36,557 --> 00:53:40,109
All vitamins in order to act have to be repeated.

221
00:53:40,551 --> 00:53:42,374
Every day you take your vitamins.

222
00:53:42,854 --> 00:53:50,901
Every day you take your mineral that you need because you say if I take it I feel better.

223
00:53:51,405 --> 00:54:00,070
That means you take the vitamin or the mineral but you’re not cured.

224
00:54:00,742 --> 00:54:11,822
The basic mechanism which is damaged is not repaired because you don’t take the vitamins for 10 days and then you are fine.

225
00:54:12,957 --> 00:54:16,245
You have to take vitamins for the rest of your life.

226
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:30,750
If a mineral is good for you that means the organism cannot absorb this and you replace it you take it for the rest of your life.

227
00:54:39,511 --> 00:54:40,598
If you need thyrhormone you take you for the rest of your life, insulin etc.

228
00:54:45,059 --> 00:54:51,326
This is not a cure but after all if we cannot do otherwise what shall we do? Yes you can give.

229
00:54:52,262 --> 00:55:13,198
The thing is that you have to have in mind that when you give a vitamin or you give several vitamins, herbs, minerals then you mask the overall picture.

230
00:55:14,166 --> 00:55:19,741
You don’t have the real picture on which to prescribe the remedy.

231
00:55:20,629 --> 00:55:28,605
If you do that then you start losing the clearness of the picture.

232
00:55:31,118 --> 00:55:51,973
In order to be sure about yourself and what you are doing you have to study quite a lot.

233
00:55:53,565 --> 00:56:04,702
Some people think for Homeopathy that you go in a seminar for 1-2 weeks and you learn, 3 weeks and you’re an expert!

234
00:56:05,422 --> 00:56:19,726
4 weeks you are flying! This is nonsense. It’s a very difficult because this science is so precise.

235
00:56:20,222 --> 00:56:42,998
You have to learn it. You know what this is? I’ll tell.

236
00:56:44,582 --> 00:57:02,310
It’s a mixture of the most powerful drugs in the world! I put them all here so just one sip and I’m back!

237
00:57:04,973 --> 00:57:24,045
I don’t to play tricks but… I played these tricks once just to show you what the fantasy can do.

238
00:57:31,038 --> 00:57:56,542
When we say we need new provings and the provings are done the way they are usually done today then what happens in these provings is almost imagination.

239
00:57:58,181 --> 00:58:06,077
If tell you in this I have put the most powerful drugs in the world, take one sip.

240
00:58:08,134 --> 00:58:20,446
Everyone takes one sip and then I have a proving and then I ask what did you feel and I collect all the symptoms

241
00:58:20,934 --> 00:58:27,622
and then I write a book on taking a sip of the most powerful drugs.

242
00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:32,533
But if do it seriously you will believe it.

243
00:58:37,830 --> 00:59:03,406
Because I am your teacher I have some authority over you… In the previous seminar we had the aphorisms concerning provings

244
00:59:04,693 --> 00:59:14,014
and then people realized what it means to make a proving. Not this kind of nonsense.

245
00:59:16,406 --> 00:59:27,807
You take a drug, you take it over your pillow and you dream in the night the effect of the drug…

246
00:59:49,134 --> 00:59:51,470
- I have question about that graph.

247
00:59:51,846 --> 00:59:53,550
Can you put it back.

248
00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:56,638
I have been trying to figure it out for 3 days.

249
01:00:12,422 --> 01:00:25,438
Is there a relationship between the horizontal axis to the levels? What is the relationship?

250
01:00:26,006 --> 01:00:40,566
Does it mean when the level is low we can catch, affect more people with low potency?
- Yes.

251
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:43,246
Will affect more people.

252
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:47,750
– So when a person is on level 1 and you give them…

253
01:00:47,851 --> 01:01:01,028
- You have 10 patients that are in the lower part and they all suffer of their liver.

254
01:01:02,172 --> 01:01:08,739
You give low potencies to them and all of them will have some effect.

255
01:01:09,396 --> 01:01:11,788
– But the people on high levels will not?

256
01:01:12,284 --> 01:01:24,660
– But the people on the higher level will not unless the remedy for them is there, included.

257
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:43,796
In this case you have 2 possibilities; one is that the person will feel good for a short period of time or the other remedies

258
01:01:44,212 --> 01:01:58,628
which are not the correct ones may also do a kind of a proving because you have repeated them for a longer period.

259
01:01:59,171 --> 01:02:03,547
So you will have proving symptoms of the rest of the remedies.

260
01:02:05,084 --> 01:02:11,988
The correct remedy will make him feel quite good.

261
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:21,156
The other people will feel an effect but it will be a modifying effect not a curative effect.

262
01:02:22,996 --> 01:02:26,532
There is a difference between curative and modifying effect.

263
01:02:26,916 --> 01:02:37,876
I can modify your structures by a remedy but I cannot cure you unless I give you the correct one.

264
01:02:38,756 --> 01:02:57,756
But because I l know that everyone has gone through a lot of grief, I can see in your faces all of you have struggled with grief situations…

265
01:03:17,508 --> 01:03:32,028
If I give you Nat-m. 200C 50% of you will feel for a while a bit better.

266
01:03:34,028 --> 01:03:51,317
It’s a modification of your uppermost layer which may need Ign., Caust., Staph. but still Nat-m.

267
01:03:51,757 --> 01:03:58,925
will have some similarity that will modify your layer so you will have some kind of an effect.

268
01:04:02,326 --> 01:04:13,366
This has a lot more to say but I don’t want to confuse you now, at this moment, by giving you all the information.

269
01:04:19,478 --> 01:04:24,094
– This morning you lectured about Homeopathy and drugs like coffee.

270
01:04:24,886 --> 01:04:34,222
In our society we are surrounded by drugs and many times patients take drugs and they don’t admit it.

271
01:04:34,694 --> 01:04:37,894
So this might have some effect on the dosage.

272
01:04:38,302 --> 01:04:47,150
How would you adjust the dosage if you have a patient for who you know that he takes drugs?

273
01:04:47,758 --> 01:04:56,117
– You have to repeat much more, everyday sometimes or every third day.

274
01:04:57,710 --> 01:05:05,197
He drinks coffee, sometimes 5 cups of coffee a day, you have to repeat every day.

275
01:05:06,598 --> 01:05:11,718
If he drinks one cup you have to repeat every 3 days if he cannot stop.

276
01:05:13,222 --> 01:05:19,621
You can still have an effect but still coffee may finally win.

277
01:05:20,238 --> 01:05:27,925
That means the caffeine will overturn the balance which your remedy created.

278
01:05:28,510 --> 01:05:29,670
It will finally do it.

279
01:05:30,134 --> 01:05:34,358
Whether it will take 1-3 years.

280
01:05:35,862 --> 01:05:54,517
– And in the case of cannabis?
-Same as coffee as excessive alcohol intake as cocaine.

281
01:05:57,022 --> 01:06:03,925
All the recreational drugs, LSD, speed etc.

282
01:06:07,062 --> 01:06:13,189
Every day the find another drug to speed up the brain.

283
01:06:13,581 --> 01:06:23,016
All these drugs that have an effect on the brain they demolish the effect of the homeopathic remedy.

284
01:06:23,816 --> 01:06:32,072
Do not allow any effect to take hold and to stay.

285
01:06:37,911 --> 01:06:52,815
But these do not go to the extent that if somebody drinks one cup of coffee you use it as an excuse that is why my remedy has not acted.

286
01:06:53,239 --> 01:06:58,815
No! One coffee will NOT antidote the remedy.

287
01:07:07,032 --> 01:07:18,408
You know I had a center with 30 medical doctors working in Athens and one time I heard one of the doctor,

288
01:07:18,992 --> 01:07:27,352
a woman, shouting I could hear her outside the consulting room, there were about 10 consulting rooms,

289
01:07:28,231 --> 01:07:37,768
as I passing on the corridor going from one to the other I heard her shouting to the patient you are stupid!

290
01:07:43,848 --> 01:07:53,183
What happened? He drank one coffee and it stopped the action of the remedy!

291
01:07:53,544 --> 01:07:58,560
I said to her to come here and tell me what is the remedy, why you gave this remedy.

292
01:07:59,072 --> 01:08:01,536
This is incorrect remedy.

293
01:08:08,112 --> 01:08:12,912
There is no reason for giving that remedy, no justification.

294
01:08:16,432 --> 01:08:26,936
But she was making such noise that the patient was totally terrified.

295
01:08:44,816 --> 01:09:02,384
– About clear picture I hope it’s not a rude question.

296
01:09:05,488 --> 01:09:10,632
– I can take a lot of rude questions without problem.

297
01:09:12,927 --> 01:09:25,280
– If the organism is wise enough to produce the symptoms and he gives us picture according to my understanding

298
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:39,424
always the organism gives a clear picture but maybe I don’t know enough the M.M. and I say it’s not a clear picture.

299
01:09:40,072 --> 01:09:46,815
How can I know that the picture is not clear or that I don’t know the clear remedy?

300
01:09:49,831 --> 01:09:52,751
– That’s not a rude question.

301
01:09:54,048 --> 01:10:07,592
That’s a clever question! Nobody knows the answer to this question.

302
01:10:13,992 --> 01:10:29,024
The question cannot be answered because should be in conjunction with the experience of the homeopath.

303
01:10:31,184 --> 01:10:36,304
The more the experience is the clearer the picture is.

304
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:41,079
But not all cases have a clear picture.

305
01:10:41,783 --> 01:10:51,928
Still, there are pictures never mind how much experience you may have you may still not be able to see the picture.

306
01:10:52,952 --> 01:11:06,456
But it is in conjunction with the experience and the knowledge of the homeopath that can see a clear picture now in this case

307
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:11,912
while an inexperienced person cannot see it.

308
01:11:12,632 --> 01:11:21,872
Many times due to my experience I can see the picture more clearly than a student.

309
01:11:33,255 --> 01:11:35,831
– I want to ask something for the diagram.

310
01:11:36,184 --> 01:11:45,777
What if wrongly you don’t pick up the symptoms of the first layer but you see the second layer, the second remedy and give it?

311
01:11:48,624 --> 01:11:56,343
– She always puts clever questions and brings me into a bad state of not knowing what to answer.

312
01:12:01,624 --> 01:12:16,056
You can give your own self, stimulate the second layer that means you increase the symptoms of the second layer

313
01:12:17,648 --> 01:12:19,456
because there is an aggravation.

314
01:12:23,664 --> 01:12:33,800
What is the person going to feel? He is going to feel a kind of confusion more than he had before.

315
01:12:34,864 --> 01:12:41,552
You hit by chance the second layer then the person feels more confused.

316
01:12:44,119 --> 01:12:54,120
Wait and things will settle down because it is like a proving.

317
01:12:55,704 --> 01:13:02,855
You wait long enough and the symptoms of the provings will go away.

318
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:21,784
If you give one dose of one potency in a person and you create proving symptoms don’t worry they will go away.

319
01:13:25,896 --> 01:13:44,912
But if you give one dose of a potency and the person feels good as far as his own symptoms are concerned and he has more energy

320
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:55,104
and joy but at the same time there are some keynote symptoms of the remedy appearing which he did not have before

321
01:13:56,839 --> 01:14:08,872
that means the remedy was correct and this is a seal that the remedy was very close, similar remedy.

322
01:14:10,104 --> 01:14:25,048
It created in the person who had such similarity with that substance a few of its own symptoms that we know as produced in its provings.

323
01:14:26,568 --> 01:14:30,839
It’s a confirmation that the remedy was correct.

324
01:14:31,431 --> 01:14:52,031
At one time when new symptoms are created and no curative effect then we have a proving the other time the remedy has done quite good

325
01:14:52,944 --> 01:14:57,344
but created some symptoms. That’s good.

326
01:14:59,688 --> 01:15:03,903
– I wanted to ask a question about things you told before.

327
01:15:04,567 --> 01:15:13,564
If I understood well, 15 minutes ago you
said if you prescribe wrongly in the

328
01:15:14,028 --> 01:15:22,333
beginning when things clarify after a while
the first layer will be even clearer.

329
01:15:23,781 --> 01:15:30,885
And now 2 mins ago I understood that it will actually be a confusion if you prescribe the second layer.

330
01:15:31,268 --> 01:15:35,260
So , wrongly again. So will you please clarify this issue?

331
01:15:36,468 --> 01:15:53,548
– This is different. When you prescribe a remedy which is close to the uppermost layer will modify it and make it clearer.

332
01:15:54,388 --> 01:16:14,404
If by chance you hit an underlying layer it cannot come up to the fore, cannot get out, and therefore changes the symptoms

333
01:16:15,645 --> 01:16:18,101
but not in a curative manner.

334
01:16:20,693 --> 01:16:35,269
A lot of times the cases which I receive here are cases in which the remedy has been given before but did not act

335
01:16:39,084 --> 01:16:48,636
and then I give a remedy first and the second remedy is a remedy which has been taken by the patient before.

336
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:03,484
What’s here remedy? Caust.

337
01:17:07,749 --> 01:17:23,413
Take a dose of Caust.! If by chance you strike the underlying layer you will have more disturbance.

338
01:17:23,988 --> 01:17:34,988
If you strike a close enough remedy to the uppermost, will modify it but still the organism will push it towards the right direction.

339
01:17:36,812 --> 01:17:43,100
Many times people have come and they have taken Calc.

340
01:17:43,733 --> 01:17:52,852
And yet I treat here and take Alum., Sulph. and then comes the time for Calc.

341
01:17:53,588 --> 01:18:01,260
But they have taken Calc., no effect. Now Calc. came to the uppermost. Beautiful effect.

342
01:18:01,605 --> 01:18:03,061
Thank you! Bye!
