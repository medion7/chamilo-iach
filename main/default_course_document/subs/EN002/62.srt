1
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:40,210
As I had promised you, we're going to go through the difficult part of Homeopathy which is our failures.

2
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:55,700
Where and why we have our failures. We're going to go deep into the matter and examine with details

3
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:05,340
what is happening while when we prescribe
 there is no effect in many cases.

4
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:14,660
We have to be aware where the problem might be and then we may be asking some help

5
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:23,510
from different other functions
 or parts  of therapies.

6
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:23,760
We go through the different causes that create disease. What can create disease in a human being?

7
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:48,720
First is the bacteria and viruses and microbes

8
00:02:53,520 --> 00:03:06,720
and of course all the poisons and these are
all the external causes of disease.

9
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:25,300
But in Homeopathy we don't accept this statement as it stands all along in the allopathic teaching.

10
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:38,450
We claim that even in that case when we have an external stimulation by microbial agent, still in order to

11
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:48,000
have a disease to have a reaction from the organism, we need to have a predisposition in this organism.

12
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:55,490
So here we need a predisposition.

13
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:07,890
You will say what is the problem,
why you say that?

14
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:21,120
It is very simple because we see in an epidemic that only certain part of the population falls sick under the epidemic;

15
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:30,800
That means those who are much
sensitive to that particular epidemic.

16
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:57,440
That idea is very prominent in the homeopathic teaching, as you know, and mostly this section concerns acute diseases.

17
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:25,970
The question is: the predisposition for acute diseases has anything to do with chronic diseases?

18
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:42,550
Is it at all connected with the idea of chronic diseases? Here in the acute conditions we see that there is

19
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:52,120
 the prodromal period there is the crisis and then the lysis when the lysis is either death or recovery.

20
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:05,550
So we don't see a connection between acute and chronic diseases but in certain cases we see

21
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:12,840
that actually after an acute disease
a chronic condition starts.

22
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:22,610
Many times you will see cases where they say, my asthma started after an influenza, my colitis started

23
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:38,420
after a viral disease which was treated but not completely gone. So therefore this suggests that each organism

24
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:48,360
has a different degree of predisposition
towards a particular bacterial agent.

25
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:14,660
If you are a Homeopath and you have looked upon a wide range of diseases, you have seen a lot of possibilities.

26
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:21,580
You have seen this happening, after an acute, a chronic arises but also you have seen that

27
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:34,800
 without any reason you have the appearance of a chronic disease or you have seen that there is some reason.

28
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:46,790
The patient will relate to you that after
 this shock my condition started.

29
00:07:46,840 --> 00:08:01,140
So here as Homeopaths we have to understand first how the disease is produced and why to understand that?

30
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:09,400
It doesn't matter, we have a disease, we treat and it's better, why to understand? No.

31
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:21,310
It is important to understand because this will give you a better idea of prognosis of the case whether the case

32
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:33,040
you're treating is possible or not possible to be cured; up to what point is going to be cured.

33
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:48,140
And we shall be seeing what are the main obstacles to cure and we have to have all this in mind when we treat,

34
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:58,450
otherwise we just prescribe remedies,
one after another without real effect.

35
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:38,320
We have a second cause of diseases which is mostly chronic and which comes from frustration of what?

36
00:09:44,700 --> 00:10:00,290
The individual gets frustrated out of three
basic things, the first is self preservation.

37
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:17,620
I have to exist, I have to continue existing. I must stay alive, this is a very strong instinct which if it is frustrated

38
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:24,580
then we have the development of
a host of symptomatology

39
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:35,260
which will depend of course again upon
the predisposition of the individual.

40
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:56,020
That is why we see cases where people are struggling really to survive, they change job, this and that and no problem.

41
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:05,940
They go ahead, they change job, they take another but this individual who is having such a resistance

42
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:20,540
to this self-preservation instinct he feels not threatened. This individual gets into a relationship, very personal relationship

43
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:32,960
and there is a shock, there is a stress there is a divorce, there is a death and this individual is destroyed.

44
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,930
So we have an instinct.

45
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:10,130
The idea of two people coming together, if we see the idea why we're attracted to each other

46
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:23,900
and I'm not talking about homosexuality now, this is apart; I'm talking about the natural attraction between male and female.

47
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:34,040
There is an attraction which we call sexual, erotic attraction, we call love, you call it whatever you call it.

48
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,250
For what reason?

49
00:12:41,320 --> 00:13:08,690
For continuity. So frustration on erotic or sexual with predisposition, can cause a very strong symptomatology.

50
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:24,760
 And this symptomatology can be from simple symptoms to death.

51
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:44,320
Here, a lot of people die from heart attack during a divorce, I lost my partner and I cannot survive,

52
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:52,950
so they just have a heart attack and they die;
 so it's a very strong instinct this.

53
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:05,880
The third is frustration on what?

54
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:34,500
Today this third frustration, the cause of disease, is something which happens primarily on
 "developed" individuals,

55
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:50,260
"evolved" individuals. They think they have solved these two problems. They have survived

56
00:14:50,360 --> 00:15:06,680
and they have a good relationship, they have overcome the need of that, this instinct has been lessened.

57
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:21,300
Somebody, Platina, they think to marry is no good because in this life to bring a child and to put this child

58
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:38,620
into war like Kosovo this holocaust is not good, so they cannot have a strong reaction on this level.

59
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:47,410
They find a partner, he is not good, we find another one, it doesn't matter, it's like this.

60
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:57,690
So the third part of frustration for the western people is the spiritual frustration.

61
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:20,740
I go very fast in these matters. These matters need you to meditate upon, to think about them aetc.

62
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,570
Otherwise we have to stay here
and discuss for days.

63
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:42,850
Spiritual frustration we have to stay a little bit longer in order to understand what we mean by this.

64
00:16:49,230 --> 00:17:10,030
In this way, if we really understand the frustration, first of all we can prevent certain tragedies which may be happening.

65
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:56,200
This portion is something which keeps the mind of almost all the people, to a greater or lesser degree.

66
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:16,750
For people in Africa this part is not very strong because these two other frustrations are very strong.

67
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:26,140
Therefore the question why we're frustrated in this level does not arise so much. They still have their deliberations,

68
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:35,180
their thinking what is this world, why we have come here, what is our purpose, what is our mission,

69
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:51,580
they still think from time to time but we, the more evolved we are spiritually, the more we're frustrated in this level

70
00:18:51,680 --> 00:19:17,330
because the self preservation
level is already difficult to solve.

71
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:36,790
The erotic and sexual is quite a source of pain and suffering and I believe because of that frustration

72
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:54,480
on this level we have escapes, not to say deviations.

73
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:08,620
You see here on this level which is even a deeper level, because this one is physical survival,

74
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:21,120
this one is psychic survival and this
of course is spiritual survival.

75
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:32,980
 So they correspond this frustration to the physical world, to the psychic world and to the spiritual world.

76
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:48,100
The more we try to solve the problem as human beings on these levels, this is difficult but we have managed,

77
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:59,490
this is more difficult and either we have managed or we have escaped from facing the problem.

78
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:13,400
But escaping or suppressing or whatever, still we have frustration, still we have disease.

79
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:31,420
Now solving for ourselves, each one of us, the big question is why I am here, because this is the spiritual frustration.

80
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:46,900
The main question is why the hell am I here? What am I doing? There are times where we're shaken by this deep question

81
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:58,600
and then we take some action because there
is a time, the moment of enlightenment.

82
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:14,400
And this is the time that we take some decisions, I'm going to India to find enlightenment or I'm going to ...

83
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,600
-.... to Alonissos

84
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:32,700
-To Alonissos to find some enlightenment or whatever. This changes your life it is so strong.

85
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:41,450
Like you decide here, I'm going
to get married. You don't like it.

86
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:54,180
You get married to solve this problem many times, to solve this frustration on this level.

87
00:22:54,280 --> 00:23:06,280
You say, after all it's not perfect but it's good enough, ok.

88
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:34,740
You will see that such decisions
actually foretell the possibility of disease,

89
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:43,520
 foretell that at a certain moment
you're going to get sick.

90
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:53,660
If you make concessions... you see here
 self-preservation is so strong,

91
00:23:53,760 --> 00:24:08,380
you say, I'll sell this product
and I know it's nothing.

92
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:21,930
I go to the Media and say, there is a fantastic product to grow your hair, whenever you put it, your hair will be growing.

93
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:34,390
Millions of people buy the product, you are rich, you solve here your self-preservation but you know that

94
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:50,030
 you have actually cheated and this is going to stay and this is going to cause disease and

95
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:59,560
this is going to cause war within you
 and this war within you is going to manifest

96
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:07,380
as war outside killing the others,
don't care about the others.

97
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:20,980
You see that's how things start. This war that is going on, does anybody understand why it's going on?

98
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:33,550
Nobody, they bombard, they have flatten the whole country but if you see the construction of society

99
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:44,150
how it has been developing on this level, you will absolutely understand why we have the war

100
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:49,200
today, why we want to kill each other.
 If I kill the others, I will survive.

101
00:25:52,040 --> 00:26:01,490
This is the idea behind which of course is the opposite than the truth, it's absolutely the opposite.

102
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:09,820
You are not going to survive here, you're going to be sick, more and more sick. Why?

103
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:21,380
Because you did some concessions on your conscience here to satisfy your self-preservation instinct,

104
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:28,420
you did concession against your conscience and you're going to pay. How? By becoming sick.

105
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:39,520
 That's why today we have societies which are basically sick in these levels.

106
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:51,880
You see the suppression of conscience is not going necessarily to manifest symptoms on the physical level.

107
00:26:52,200 --> 00:27:06,490
It will manifest symptoms on the psychic level because all these three levels are together.

108
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:31,640
So the spiritual frustration comes to us because we have mishandled these two other instincts.

109
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:46,960
We misunderstood how we should act, how we shouldn't act and we lost our health.

110
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,080
The payment is you lose your health, finished.

111
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:03,670
Now of course is not only very simple that
 you do something against your conscience

112
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:15,000
because there are subtleties which
they create these inner imbalances.

113
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:33,490
Here, in the erotic-sexual, I give you a very common escape from that level which is

114
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:45,780
instead of having a correct education in this
level, if we knew what we're doing we could

115
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:52,170
  foresee the problems which are coming and prevent them.

116
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:59,530
Now here what is the first escape that we see?

117
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,980
-Masturbation?

118
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:22,100
-Yes masturbation. The first escape is masturbation, why? Because there is no health,

119
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:31,730
 in a child 3,5,6 years old there is masturbation.
Is he conscious of what he is doing?

120
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:41,400
 Of course the hormonal balance is unbalanced and therefore  the child has to have it.

121
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:46,000
  Otherwise it will go crazy.

122
00:29:50,090 --> 00:30:01,000
We have created more and more problems for ourselves and then more and more problems start from very young age.

123
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:12,540
First escape is masturbation because the societies which we created did not educate properly the children.

124
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,270
And what is a proper education?

125
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:28,690
We are talking about basic things
in health. So what you tell your children?

126
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:42,620
I'll tell you something; it doesn't matter what you tell them. If the children are unbalanced in these levels forget what you tell them.

127
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:56,460
Now it's too late to tell them. It has to be told a few generations before to prevent all this happening

128
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:05,620
but even then some children are still
quite healthy and they can listen.

129
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:16,060
And if you educate them and you say to them that having a relationship on a sexual level is a very great,

130
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:25,220
a very interesting thing, a very interesting experience which they have to wait until they reach such an age

131
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:36,580
  that they can enjoy it. Otherwise they will misuse it and they will be dying in this level. You will be dead.

132
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:52,060
It's like you tell a child, don't eat Arsenicum
it's a poison and the child knows it's a poison.

133
00:31:53,040 --> 00:32:07,830
Here, on this level we let the children totally uneducated. The mothers they don't want to know what the children

134
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:21,060
are doing the fathers are very busy and then
you will see how all this comes to you as a

135
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:27,900
Homeopath and they say, take the problem now.

136
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,350
All this problem, all this generation say, take the problem and fix it and then you are in despair.

137
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:48,060
Because you understand that this child is sick and they say, oh he has some personality problems.

138
00:32:49,360 --> 00:33:00,300
It's not personality problem only, what type of personality? Ah the child wants to be by himself,

139
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:13,340
alone and plays only with his toys. The other child is aggressive and hits and fights,

140
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:27,540
the other one is restless and the other one is the superman that will fly with the batman.

141
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:42,580
This little deviation is actually the end result of generations of wrong doing.

142
00:33:50,970 --> 00:34:04,200
Then you give Cicuta or Bar-c. You have to understand the depth of the problem.

143
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:34,420
For me, when I realized these things, it was a cause for deep despair because you realize how much you have to work

144
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:47,470
with that child, how many years before you can bring him more to the healthy side and
 you have to understand

145
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:55,550
what you're doing with the child. Otherwise you just throw remedies here and there. It's not the idea.

146
00:34:55,650 --> 00:35:09,310
The idea is where is he going? Towards health or is it just removing some of its symptoms?

147
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:31,960
You want to really know, you want to understand because on the way to cure, you will see very frightening situations.

148
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:43,940
You treat a child and then it goes into severe pneumonia, take antibiotics now and as we have said

149
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:50,480
this is the time where you have to be careful, you have to prescribe correctly to take him

150
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:56,840
from that state further and then you will see.

151
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:10,030
What? The spiritual frustration eases out.
I don't say spiritual quest.

152
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:17,980
Spiritual quest is different than spiritual frustration.

153
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:27,540
Spiritual quest is something quite healthy.
 I would like to know why I am here.

154
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:39,320
This is a legitimate question but it doesn't
torment me, it doesn't make me make the
wrong decision.

155
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:59,990
The spiritual frustration on this level will take somebody suddenly wake up and say, I would like to go and find God.

156
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:18,940
Where? In Indonesia. I heard the -whatever it's called- is there and they put on some special clothes

157
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:25,180
and they fly to Indonesia to solve their
 spiritual frustration.

158
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:41,610
This is a decision which comes from already a diseased mind. You have to know because some people will come and say

159
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:58,910
'shall I go to Indonesia?' Why? 'Because something inside me tells me to go there to find answers.'

160
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:07,840
You understand that this is a
wrong decision for the boy.

161
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:26,000
I remember a case in India. A very rich family from Paris. His father was an industrialist and left a lot of money.

162
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:36,060
He was wandering about in India, we met
when I was a student there and treating certain people.

163
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:45,980
And he came to Krishnamurti's lectures and
 he was there eating only that particular food

164
00:38:46,080 --> 00:39:07,340
cooking that food which was vegetarian, he had a cat who was also vegetarian. It was terribly looking,

165
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:25,100
but my cat is also vegetarian. And he had this very spiritual look and talked very slowly and we talked.

166
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:58,560
And he said: I think I have on my right toe a pain here, can you prescribe something for this pain? I said yes, sure.

167
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,830
Nothing else?  Nothing else.

168
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:29,520
In the meantime we have discussed quite a lot and I perceived what was happening with him.

169
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:49,560
He was going with a very heavy cover where the people living in Himalaya have this and he was going with it.

170
00:40:51,980 --> 00:41:11,280
He had a caravan, he was travelling up and down in India and then I started prescribing for him.

171
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:21,680
I prescribed for about a year and a half,
several remedies.

172
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:37,820
The man came out of that situation one day and he said to me, you know what? I am the son of a very rich man who died.

173
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:46,140
My father died, my mother also and they left us a lot of money. What happened with the money?

174
00:41:46,450 --> 00:42:00,260
The money now is with my brother-in-law. And how do you live? He sends me every month some money.

175
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:16,260
Then, I don't remember he asked for some money or wrote a letter and there was a denial,

176
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,320
we cannot give you more money.

177
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:36,240
He was talking about millions of francs that was left on his account and he was taking very little money to survive in India.

178
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:52,260
Finally to just finish the story we went together back to France to meet his sister and his brother-in-law

179
00:42:52,360 --> 00:43:00,760
who was handling the money, to find out that he had no money at all. The brother-in-law said,

180
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:06,080
we lost all the money and we don't have any money at all.

181
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:30,060
He suddenly became a very poor man and he was realizing that he was trusting his brother-in-law who took all the money.

182
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:40,630
I said, you never controlled? No, he was sending me some money for years.

183
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:46,080
He was roaming about in India trying to get enlightenment.

184
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:55,500
He had solved self preservation by thinking he was rich, he had solved the erotic-sexual

185
00:43:55,600 --> 00:44:06,920
by suppressing it and reaching the
spiritual frustration on the wrong path.

186
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:17,900
You cannot reach the spiritual quest.
You reach spiritual frustration.

187
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:26,080
Self preservation, I'm rich now I have
enough money, it's finished.

188
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:38,870
Erotic-sexual, I don't get along with the girl,
 it doesn't matter, I will suppress it and then I go for spiritual quest;

189
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:52,120
 this is not possible because when you reach here, you are crazy, you have the sperm of craziness.

190
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,400
Not balanced, imbalanced.

191
00:44:57,590 --> 00:45:19,300
Therefore you have to go through these steps in a very natural, normal way. You cannot just wake up in a day and say,

192
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:23,860
I want to get spiritual enlightenment,
let me go to India.

193
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:35,680
You see all these people who went to India to meet the yogis, what happened? Most of them became crazy.

194
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:46,470
Some others of course were disillusioned, they went to India and they came back, like myself.

195
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:14,300
If you persist on the idea that in India I will find spiritual enlightenment and this you're forcing yourself,

196
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:27,320
you are ready for a very deep disorder
which will be mostly on mental level.

197
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:40,900
So what happens with our societies today, the western societies, a lot of these people are
within this realm,

198
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:52,220
struggling without having solved this frustration, they are trying to solve this level.

199
00:46:54,970 --> 00:47:01,360
As a result we have the diseases
 that we see today.

200
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:18,300
-Isn't possible George that after going through the first two levels, then you reach the third level?

201
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:25,060
At a certain age you feel that now you have important questions, that it will be a phase that you also have to struggle

202
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:36,120
because you also want to go through the third phase. So wouldn't be normal to have such struggling and questions?

203
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:53,120
-As I said, it is different between having to struggle, having to work and being frustrated.

204
00:47:53,880 --> 00:48:05,480
Frustration is when you have an idea that if I go one year in India I will get enlightenment. One year passes

205
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:11,990
and nothing has happened, then you start getting frustrated then a second year you're in a big frustration,

206
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:22,300
the third year you are destroyed. I have seen around Krishnamurti a lot.

207
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:29,060
What I teach here is absolutely experience
 and nothing else. It's not theories.

208
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:45,200
I was around Krishnamurti, I saw hundreds if not thousands of dead people. Dead emotionally. When I say dead,

209
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:54,930
I mean dead there was nothing there. You can't move them. Treat me. What to treat? What can I do?

210
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:08,180
Almost you can do nothing. You can not bring them back to life. We have for this level several remedies.

211
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:25,140
The main one is of course Sepia. Sepia is the main remedy for this frustration where the individual

212
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:40,500
has given up the idea of having a relationship.
I was just told yesterday there is a documentary on Sepia

213
00:49:40,600 --> 00:50:00,950
by National Geographic where they show the Sepia mating and he told me that it is so colorful, so playful, so full of feelings.

214
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:24,310
 This mating is amazing where in the provings Sepia is actually exactly the opposite of playful, of colorful, of participating.

215
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:34,540
A Sepia woman, oh I have to do it again, she doesn't move, she doesn't do anything, she just waits for the man

216
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:43,490
to finish and that's it. This is the Sepia,
she doesn't feel anything.

217
00:50:50,320 --> 00:51:08,060
The whole idea is against some notions that if we know the qualities of the fish or the shellfish,  from that we can induce the

218
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:21,230
symptomatology of the remedy. You know this movement?

219
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:30,580
There is a movement where they don't do provings anymore, they take the habits of an animal

220
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:44,740
 and these habits transfer them into symptoms of Materia Medica. This exactly proves the opposite.

221
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:13,920
-I just want to know, is it necessary that we move easily from one to the other?

222
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:24,320
-With treatment or without treatment? With treatment the answer is different.

223
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:37,940
Without treatment what may happen is, maybe you can be saved by entering into spiritual frustration,

224
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:48,020
by accident, by somebody telling you a few things, then you realize but most probably if
you reach that stage

225
00:52:48,120 --> 00:53:00,810
then nobody can save you. Unless you have a good Homeopath and he takes you from here to here to here.

226
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:10,460
The disturbance on this level is going to be carried here and it's going to be carried to the sexual

227
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:17,800
and on the physical and then it's going to become on the outside of the physical.

228
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:34,440
Here, if you are very frustrated here and I give you a remedy, you may have a heart problem of  course

229
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:49,250
but if by yourself you're there
 and you try to find balance here...

230
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:56,820
 find balance here is nothing less than connection with God, that means me and God

231
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:01,300
are one and the same, we're connected.

232
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:14,720
This is solution of this level, this only very few individuals and very healthy individuals can attain.

233
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:28,960
If we are sick and through our sickness we try to solve this level, forget it, we're creating problems.

234
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:42,580
-I was asking a different question. If someone is growing and they solve their preservation problem and they now

235
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:55,980
are moving, they start solving the erotic problems and they start moving into the spiritual but they are not yet finished with

236
00:54:56,080 --> 00:55:03,120
the second level, do you keep going back and forth between levels or you just finish with one level and go to the third?

237
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:14,540
-The idea is when you are in this level, are you in a healthy manner or you are unhealthy?

238
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:22,580
You are frustrated yes or no? If you're frustrated, that means you have followed prematurely a path of evolution

239
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:36,230
which is not yet right for you. This whole idea comes to the idea of truth.

240
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:59,370
What I mean by truth? I mean seen in myself what is true in me here, here or there. Really.

241
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:10,300
On the spiritual level if you know that I still have these incapacities, I still have these shortcomings,

242
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:21,330
I still have these wrong doings this is very good, there is no danger. But if you think I have overcome all that

243
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:27,620
and now I'm going to become God, this is very dangerous.

244
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:40,360
Now I'm going to become very spiritual person. This is very dangerous for the health of the individual.

245
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:52,150
There are a lot of individuals living
of course with their madness, these fantasies.

246
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:57,730
You will say, what is wrong with
 them? Let them continue.

247
00:56:57,830 --> 00:57:05,360
This is not for me to decide whether they continue or not. For me to decide is, can I cure

248
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:20,360
and what kind of disturbance
he has?  Is it the nail?

249
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:30,200
I have to know what is the level in which he is suffering and to know can I cure such a case?
Yes or no?

250
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:51,990
Somebody comes and tells me, 'ah, I admire you so much, you have so much and we're working together in an inner level.'

251
00:57:58,010 --> 00:58:15,580
It sounds very interesting, ok what am I doing? He says, bla, bla, bla and can you give me some

252
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:22,120
concrete information of  what is this cooperation about.

253
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:35,090
And these people are living in spiritual frustration. She comes to me and says, 'from time to time

254
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:39,500
I have a little pain in the stomach
can you give me a remedy?'

255
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:52,120
If she has given me before this idea, that she lives into her fantasy so much, can I cure this little pain? No.

256
00:58:52,220 --> 00:59:11,270
Because if I try to cure this little pain, this pain will become an ulcer and you have to know this and I have to tell her.

257
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:18,400
I'm sorry it's not possible for me to cure you.

258
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:27,900
Otherwise you give a remedy for the little pain and what happens the pain may even go away

259
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:33,520
but the woman goes deeper into her delusions.

260
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:40,920
Why do we deal with such cases?

261
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:58,980
The percentage all together of such cases that we may have, in different countries is different.

262
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:09,640
 The more you go to the North, the more
 we see this spiritual frustration.

263
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:28,280
The more you go to the South, to Africa, to South America, they enjoy their life, spiritual? We have time, next life.

264
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:38,760
Greece is in the middle, it's
neither South nor North.

265
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:52,390
-You mentioned before that if somebody comes with spiritual frustration, he has tried to tackle this issue too early.

266
01:00:52,490 --> 01:01:04,870
So for me the question is spiritual a matter of age or is it also possible to have it in very young years ?

267
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:19,760
It is possible that even very young age you see some people who are very spiritual, balanced

268
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:29,600
they don't go and do crazy things,
this is not definitely a matter of age.

269
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:51,790
But it depends on the mission of the individual. If his mission is to transfer some knowledge to others then he needs age.

270
01:01:51,890 --> 01:01:58,760
He needs experience, even very spiritual young people they don't have the experience,

271
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:11,200
so in order to transfer to others
they need experience, they need age.

272
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:33,200
I would like your feedback on these ideas and questions to see whether this matter is well understood or misunderstood.

273
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:47,310
So please give me your feedback, even if you have a different idea, it doesn't matter we discuss and we find out.

274
01:02:52,790 --> 01:02:58,700
-I think that in the United States there is a very high level of spiritual frustration and perhaps

275
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:04,920
we should be moved up geographically
 towards the North Pole.

276
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:27,580
We have such high incidents of new age psychology that people are living in their fantasies

277
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:33,060
about what spirituality is to a degree
 which is quite frightening.

278
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:46,410
My question is since I am in that environment, in the northern part of North America, can you recommend

279
01:03:46,510 --> 01:03:55,540
any course of treatment so that the delusional component can be disolved without bringing about

280
01:03:55,640 --> 01:04:07,700
the angina or the colitis and so forth. I haven't, in my experience, seen in these cases which I agree with you

281
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:18,410
this is a beautifully represented portrait of what the human psyche is at least in my experience in U.S.,

282
01:04:18,510 --> 01:04:27,710
I've seen that by giving even LM potencies, even when people are apparently very healthy because there is such

283
01:04:27,810 --> 01:04:41,100
anxiety about their health; so they eat healthy, they are communing with animals, with higher nature.

284
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:51,500
And if someone goes against their belief system, immediately they turn to hatred toward the person

285
01:04:51,600 --> 01:05:02,950
which obviously conveys theirself of not being spiritual. So in seeing this as a very deep pathology without

286
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:13,860
 tissue change I would say it's on the lower level 3 or upper 4, in terms of using your levels of health.

287
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:22,440
I found that in treating these individuals are in the same level with those on deep pathological tissue change.

288
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:31,780
Using low potencies, as LM for example, do not bring about such a strong physical reaction but it is a concern of mine

289
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:40,960
and it's also very deep concern to them that they will start to aquire physical pathology.

290
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:51,100
-We will be talking in detail because during this course we're going to see how we handle these cases.

291
01:05:52,160 --> 01:06:03,140
Not only these particular frustration cases but cases that present special difficulty for homeopathic prescribing.

292
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:10,770
There are a lot of categories, a lot of groups of people that present special difficulties for us.

293
01:06:10,870 --> 01:06:16,780
 I don't want to give you the impression
 that most of the cases are difficult cases.

294
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:27,240
And I can tell you from my experience, about 10% of all the groups that we will be talking, is the percentage

295
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:37,240
 that presents special problems for the Homeopaths. This gives you another 90% possibility to be successful.

296
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:50,380
-My question is, is not the idea in front of the spiritual frustration?

297
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:59,460
Wanting to approach God, to become like
 God is that not the point?

298
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:11,880
and having an attitude of humbleness
 that will solve the problem.

299
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:26,290
-That is quite correct, the spiritual frustration comes almost together with a spiritual arrogance.

300
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:40,470
I remember a case, she was a woman, that I treated unsuccessfully for many years. Her attitude was like this.

301
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:53,660
One day we met some people that were really very spiritual people. She met them first and then she invited me

302
01:07:53,760 --> 01:08:14,140
 to meet them also. After a while she says, yes the theory was that these people were the number 1.

303
01:08:17,550 --> 01:08:33,200
A unity, it's God but one day she says, but I'm zero before them, so I have created them.

304
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:57,270
To hear these things, you know I was trying to cure such a person, I was giving remedies to no avail.

305
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:08,100
The idea was that beyond any spiritual activity that was happening on this planet, she was behind

306
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:21,900
and she was the cause of that activity. If this ego is so great, the frustration is so much that has become

307
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:35,510
almost like a stone inside the person, it cannot break. You see everything else revolves around that hard core

308
01:09:35,610 --> 01:09:42,970
  and then it doesn't matter what remedies you may be giving, there will be no effect.

309
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:49,450
Maybe some symptoms will shift here and there, but no real effect, no change.

310
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:59,120
-Can you put the same 3 levels of frustration, can you equalize them through the levels,

311
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:03,430
 physical level, emotional and spiritual level?

312
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:19,380
-Absolutely, this is the idea. This comes together with the general idea who is the human being

313
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:30,180
 and what levels within which he's living etc. These 3 levels of frustration correspond to frustrations

314
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:38,460
on physical body, emotional body and
 on the mental body, spiritual body.

315
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:51,410
Definitely, but they are interelated. A frustration here, may stay a frustration only on this level.

316
01:10:51,510 --> 01:11:00,460
If it is a frustration here and some of the impact of the frustration can go here or there or even there

317
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:07,650
this is quite hopeful. So if you see somebody who is struggling spiritually, but at the same time

318
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:21,920
he has physical problems, he is in a much better state than a person frustrated here, without physical symptoms.

319
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:36,980
-If somebody has such a big delusion, which possibilities do we have as practitioners, to explain them

320
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:46,760
that for this pain in the stomach, we first have to solve his mental problem and then the physical problem?

321
01:11:47,490 --> 01:11:54,620
-For the case I mentioned to you I have tried everything; it didn't work. Nevermind how much you can explain,

322
01:11:54,720 --> 01:12:06,780
they cannot because it's a belief system that is crystalised and if it breaks, it will break out in a very malignant way,

323
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:17,480
 that means this stone here, if it breaks, it will create a malignancy on a physical level.

324
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:32,540
-I have the impression that in Germany the spiritual frustration is accepted. With patients that suffer from psychosis

325
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:42,170
and they get physical symptoms and the psychosis reduces, then the patient has no understanding for this.

326
01:12:42,270 --> 01:12:49,740
He rather wants to be psychotic again and not suffer from the physical disease. Because people

327
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:54,200
don't want to suffer any physical pain.

328
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:06,920
-That is true sometimes. What I speak here about spiritual frustration is not

329
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:21,040
the total destruction on the mental level. Total destruction which is schizophrenia is different,

330
01:13:21,140 --> 01:13:33,070
 the individual could not anymore retain
 reality and escapes totally.

331
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:43,790
Total escape from everything; then all these levels were not concerned anymore with the frustration on these levels

332
01:13:43,890 --> 01:13:50,940
 because we have a total destruction
of the core of the human being.

333
01:13:51,040 --> 01:14:01,620
So therefore it is an escape. Now you bring back this man who has escaped, and you show him reality.

334
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:10,840
And he comes to reality and says, 'still I don't like it. I'm going to escape' but don't forget that the escape

335
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:29,700
 is the result of a body which is quite diseased.
 With homeopathy actually we try to build this body to retain the reality

336
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:37,870
so he will have a relapse, what you're saying actually is a relapse and then you try again and you try again

337
01:14:37,970 --> 01:14:46,140
until and unless maybe there is a little possibility that you may bring him back eventually

338
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:56,380
with strong physical symptoms and he will be able to accept the symptom and live with this suffering, with this reality.

339
01:14:58,940 --> 01:15:20,580
I have seen cases where as a young man he's 20,21,22 goes off and he has electroshocks

340
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:29,210
and comes back in a way and at the age
of 40 there is paralysis.

341
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:46,380
You see this history, there is multiple sclerosis, gives you an idea of the depth of the problem in this organism.

342
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:53,830
So when you start treating such a case, you don't say ah I found the remedy. It doesn't matter;

343
01:15:53,930 --> 01:16:03,350
you found the remedy but there is another layer, another layer because you're dealing with a very deep destruction

344
01:16:03,450 --> 01:16:18,700
of the nervous system, central and peripheral.
So it's different the prognosis of this case.

345
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:27,130
This case you don't like though you may be able with good prescribing to keep them walking for years

346
01:16:27,230 --> 01:16:33,110
for 10, 15, 20 years they keep walking, they
don't go to the chair, but that's all you can do.

347
01:16:33,210 --> 01:16:37,060
They're stuck there,
they cannot progress anymore.

348
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:48,250
Because the progress in further, will mean the destruction of a main organ, maybe the heart.

349
01:16:51,680 --> 01:17:00,500
-Again a question about spiritual frustration. Could you perhaps say some words about what for you

350
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:06,880
would be a healthy way of developing in that level?

351
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:15,900
Because more and more patients come to us with physical problems and more people are getting

352
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:29,640
spiritually interested and in this and in that, at least in my practice. To differientate is still healthy or is it frustration?

353
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:43,940
-I will not like to say what is the healthy way to go but what I would like to give you as information is how

354
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:50,380
you handle such cases and how you differientate between one case and the other.

355
01:17:50,480 --> 01:18:04,390
When the patient comes, you have to make a discussion on these levels so you understand his degree of craziness, delusion.

356
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:17,830
If you see this degree of delusion is very deep and it is deep when? The deeper it is, the more you will see

357
01:18:17,930 --> 01:18:33,860
the egotistical element. I am the greatest. When you see this element you have to be careful and then you have to expect

358
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:41,580
that if your treatment is correct you will have to have severe problems with the physical body.

359
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:50,060
Now what you tell them, how you advise such individuals. You have to advise very carefully
and say,

360
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:57,770
why don't you take it more easy, why don't you give up this? Because usually such people they have followers

361
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:13,930
They are weak individuals who like to see somebody who says I'm God and they follow God.

362
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:33,980
 But you have to be careful because we're
 talking about diseased individuals here.

363
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:44,700
We're not concerned with real spiritual people. There are some real spiritual people that

364
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:58,660
 have gone through this in a quite nice
manner. And they have arrived at a point

365
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:16,150
 where they feel that they have a wisdom which is substantial and love which is also substantial

366
01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:28,740
 so they are able to give to others because people who have reached this level are always creative.

367
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:32,020
  They are not destructive, they don't do something to destruct.

368
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:45,300
 A wise man with love, always creates, never destructs. So if you see that, without the claim

369
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:52,880
I'm God...because if you see that claim immediately you have to be aware that

370
01:20:52,980 --> 01:21:00,780
something is wrong with the individual
 and maybe quite seriously wrong.

371
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:14,400
You have to advise and tell them be careful, if you continue in this way maybe you'll have much more problems.

372
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:25,250
-What about the catholic priests? They are not allowed to have any normal sex.

373
01:21:25,350 --> 01:21:36,600
Is it a possibility to them to reach any spirituality?

374
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,800
-It's a good question.

375
01:21:52,520 --> 01:22:07,670
There are certain individuals, very few,
who are able to go through this level without much frustration.

376
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:19,220
 They are able to really overcome the level,
 it's not a suppression, it's an understanding.

377
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:30,780
They need their organism to take and give love on a much higher level, higher than the physical.

378
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:45,220
That means the exchange is on psychic
level, so it feeds them in a nice way.

379
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:56,620
People who go for advice to them, give them love, they give love to the people who they advice

380
01:22:56,720 --> 01:23:02,220
and in this way they find a balance inside themself. There is no problem.

381
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:10,610
Now these people, have solved this problem, especially because the self-preservation is ended,

382
01:23:10,710 --> 01:23:20,300
 they have a security. If they have an organism which can do that, they have overcome this level.

383
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:34,420
Their struggle because being a priest that means you target yourself to the unification with the divine.

384
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:48,310
So their struggle will be here and it will be in
 a natural way but the majority is different.

385
01:23:48,410 --> 01:23:54,400
 They have to suppress and they have to escape.

386
01:23:57,200 --> 01:24:06,740
By having an escape the individual is frustrated because he knows, I use masturbation or I use homosexuality.

387
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:27,470
Immediately there is a consciousness which puts them in an anxiety state; that is going to be a problem for this level.

388
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:40,460
-I experience that children who are for instance in terminal stage of cancer, they become very wise and they have

389
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:45,800
very smart remarks. I would like to ask
 what has happened here?

390
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:52,780
If I would ask the question in a provocative way,
 I would say that the cancer has been educating them

391
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:57,480
 in a wrong way or they have a predisposition to develop this disease or not?

392
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:12,820
-Such children have a very bad health in
general but due to certain circumstances,

393
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:20,500
all the force of this imbalance, comes on the physical body.

394
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:28,600
And then destroys the physical body, leaving
the mental-emotional very clear.

395
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:40,140
That is why we see this behaviour in these children. Because they are so healthy, so perceptive, so balanced

396
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:54,700
 in their last moments, it is amazing. I have also observed the same thing. The reason is that all the disbalance

397
01:25:54,800 --> 01:26:03,860
has been concentrated upon the physical body and the mental-emotional has been left, intact.

398
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:16,400
But the overall health of such child is very
bad. I'll give you some percentages.

399
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:58,390
Mental-Emotional-Physical. In order for someone to die and to die suddenly, it needs to have out of 100 points,  90 points of disease.

400
01:26:58,490 --> 01:27:11,010
These 90 points can be distributed in this way. Mental 20, Emotional 20 and Physical 50.

401
01:27:14,870 --> 01:27:20,560
This person is going to live for many years.

402
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:34,860
Given now that something happens on the mental-emotional which clears up these points

403
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:54,160
and M is 0, E is 0 and all 90 come to the physical, the physical body can not withstand such an impact and dies.

404
01:27:55,020 --> 01:28:21,770
0 disease here, 0 disease emotional, 90% on the physical body, cannot survive but M 40 here,
E 20, P 30 mentally deranged.

405
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:38,680
But let us say, M 80, E 10, P 0 this person is schizophrenic, he's going to live for a long time.

406
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:58,400
The physical body is left intact, no symptoms. It can live many, many years with destruction on this level.

407
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:14,160
That is why the child is here, on this line, when he dies.

408
01:29:17,670 --> 01:29:23,060
-If you solve the problem of self-preservation of the first level, when you didn't suppress anything

409
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:34,960
on the second level, is one then
protected from spiritual frustration?

410
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:53,810
-He is protected yes. As long as the general health of this individual is in quite good condition.

411
01:29:53,910 --> 01:30:08,920
That means out of 100 points, his total points are 30. If his total points are 30 points of disease, then such a person

412
01:30:09,020 --> 01:30:24,630
 who has solved the problems on these two levels, can go to spiritual quest or understanding without much danger.

413
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:42,940
There is a little danger, as long as this goes down, less, as it goes up, more. Because here the energy is very powerful.

414
01:30:52,240 --> 01:31:01,660
I have met people that they had what we call, spiritual enlightenment. During these points,

415
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:13,090
during these moments, the energy which goes through the body is so strong, the real spiritual enlightenment

416
01:31:13,190 --> 01:31:25,420
is so strong that if these points are a little bit high, it burns out the body. It can destroy the physical body.

417
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:38,860
The physical body cannot stand this much of bliss of enlightenment, of understanding, it is something beyond

418
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:49,650
the capacity of us to understand
 these strong spiritual experiences.

419
01:31:50,080 --> 01:32:02,420
So unless you have a body which is quite strong, it will be destroyed. That's why I was reading the other day in a book.

420
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:13,060
He says, if this experience remained for more than a few minutes, I would be dead. They feel it.

421
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:20,800
I was reading a book from one
of these monks in Mount Athos.

422
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:37,250
- There is some measurements for spiritual development because if you're on a spiritual
way, love grows.

423
01:32:37,350 --> 01:32:46,030
And if it's the right way, love for others is growing and if it's the wrong way, love for youself, egotism is growing.

424
01:32:46,130 --> 01:33:00,280
I think that even if you have solved the 2 levels you can still get sick on the third level.

425
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:13,610
-I agree.

426
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:52,310
-We said that we like more to have disturbances on mental-emotional and physical than just having mental.

427
01:33:55,300 --> 01:34:11,280
Here is a person with 50 points of disease. One has 10 points on the mental level, 20 points here and 20 points here.

428
01:34:13,050 --> 01:34:26,920
This case is better than a case that we have
40 points here, 5 points here and 5 here.

429
01:34:32,210 --> 01:34:44,770
We have mental problems but at the same time physical. It's better than to have mostly mental and very little physical.

430
01:34:45,540 --> 01:34:57,700
Of course it is much better not to have any problems here and have all the 50 points here.

431
01:34:58,090 --> 01:35:13,170
This case is a limit case which we can treat with success. These people here, you will see that inspite of their pathology,

432
01:35:13,270 --> 01:35:22,940
they are very happy people. They have a lot
of energy, they are happy, they like to live.

433
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:29,980
 You will see a healthy attitude towards
life but they suffer quite a lot.

434
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:39,770
This is a case in the limits. You have to very clearly understand these points.

435
01:35:43,630 --> 01:35:54,770
-Before Margaret said something about love and egotism. I don't think you should put these two together at all

436
01:35:54,870 --> 01:36:04,780
because egotism is not love. People use love for egotism but a person should love himself in order to love others

437
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:08,790
because if you are not full, you can't give nothing.

438
01:36:08,890 --> 01:36:20,710
-It's the same. It doesn't matter how you say it. What you say is the same thing. If you love too much yourself

439
01:36:20,810 --> 01:36:24,040
 is wrong but you have to love yourself.

440
01:36:24,140 --> 01:36:25,810
-In order to love others.

441
01:36:25,910 --> 01:36:38,980
-So it doesn't mean because you love yourself is wrong. No. You have to love yourself but not only yourself, this is the idea.

442
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:45,400
Because if you love only yourself, you don't care; then you throw some bombs and you kill.

443
01:36:53,520 --> 01:37:02,180
-I have one small problem understanding the example with the priest or the monk or somebody else.

444
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:14,420
I think there is no problem that somebody can get spiritually elevated and perhaps not having a relationship

445
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:26,610
but also being able to love the people and getting his pressure off the hormonal system escaping with masturbation.

446
01:37:26,710 --> 01:37:35,620
Why this should be a problem? Because he also could be very creative and much loving the others.

447
01:37:35,720 --> 01:37:39,180
I don't see any problem.

448
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:53,860
-Ok, I'll tell you where is the problem and what is the problem. The problem is with his own conscience

449
01:37:53,960 --> 01:38:06,730
in understanding how he tries to avoid a natural phenomenon, which happens in nature.

450
01:38:09,890 --> 01:38:26,820
It doesn't matter whether the individual understands this, the nature, attraction etc. Still with the children,

451
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:31,680
when they practice masturbation, there is the idea they do something secretly.

452
01:38:31,780 --> 01:38:39,860
Have you ever seen a child, unless it is mentally disturbed, to do masturbation in front of the class?

453
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:52,620
No, he will go secretly. Why? Because he knows it is something not allowed, not proper, not correct etc.

454
01:38:54,480 --> 01:39:02,390
The idea of doing something wrong is
 there already even if it is not strong.

455
01:39:06,340 --> 01:39:16,900
I may accept that a spiritual person may go into spirituality, having to practice masturbation from time to time,

456
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:25,140
 to release the hormones. I even go as far
as that but still the problem will remain.

457
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:31,660
There is a draw back because of that function.

458
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:46,350
Big or less. Somebody else who is priest and has homosexual contacts has a bigger problem, definitely.

459
01:39:46,450 --> 01:39:57,130
And someone who is a priest and goes with married women here and there, he has even bigger problem.

460
01:39:57,690 --> 01:40:16,060
And he who is a priest and goes secretely to have sex in the brothels, he has a problem.

461
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:31,000
I have seen and I have talked with monks who could not retain. I treated them and they confessed

462
01:40:31,100 --> 01:40:42,400
what they had to do. They were in a terrible state spiritually, there is no question. My God.
