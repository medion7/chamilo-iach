1
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:37,179
We start with a little bit of theory. Today I have chosen par. 210 of the Organon.

2
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:50,769
I think there is a confusion and we will see what is the confusion concerning this paragraph.

3
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:15,169
There are some teachers who have translated this paragraph 210 as meaning that in every case you have mental symptoms.

4
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:19,179
This is what Hahnemann says. In every case you have mental symptoms.

5
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:33,499
Therefore you search for every case for these mental symptoms and find a remedy that fits these mental symptoms in every case.

6
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:49,579
And here is a kind of misinterpretation of the Organon. And I will tell you why.

7
00:01:49,640 --> 00:02:04,470
I will read the paragraph 210 on which Hahnemann speaks about mental diseases.

8
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,159
He says, most diseases that I have previously described as partial, belong to psora and this appear

9
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:26,489
to be more difficult to cure owing to the partial development. Where all other symptoms of the disease

10
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:33,460
 are obscured by the presence of one great prominent symptom.

11
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:46,799
Actually what he means here is when we have a mental disorder, the mental symptoms are becoming very strong

12
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:52,619
and all the other symptoms
disappear or are suppressed.

13
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:10,139
The so called diseases of the mind and temperament are of this kind.

14
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:22,899
These however do not constitute a class of diseases strictly distinct from others.

15
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:35,139
Because the state of the mind is always altered in so called physical diseases.

16
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:43,459
And this is where the misinterpretation comes.

17
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:55,190
The state of the mind is always altered, modified.

18
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:06,640
So those teachers who read this, they say here Hahnemann says that in every case you will find mental symptoms.

19
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:14,649
Therefore you have to find a remedy that fits the mental picture.

20
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:40,419
Is this correct? You're reading this paragraph 210 and Hahnemann says, the state of mind is always altered

21
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:53,939
during any disease physical or otherwise. Therefore do you have or do you not have mental symptoms?

22
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:09,110
If Hahnemann says so, how can we think otherwise?

23
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:20,760
Here Hahnemann has a sub-note 121 which gives an example of what he means.

24
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:36,032
He says in painful diseases for instance, of several years standing, we frequently meet with gentle dispositions

25
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:42,649
commanding respect and compassion on the part of the physician, for the patient.

26
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:57,649
But as soon as the disease is conquered and the patient restore to health, a possibility of frequent occurrence

27
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:05,729
under homeopathic treatment, the physician will often be amazed and shocked at the frightful changes

28
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:21,819
in the disposition of the patient. Ingratitude, obduracy, refined malice and the most disgraceful

29
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:33,910
and capricious are often seem to reappear all of which were peculiar to the patient in times of health.

30
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:45,539
Is this a suppression? The person was cured from a long standing disease.

31
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:59,709
And you cure him and while he was nice, then he becomes malicious, irritable.

32
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:04,379
Is Hahnemann talking about a suppression here?

33
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:17,369
And he goes on in the same paragraph. He says, persons who are patient in health are often found in sickness

34
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:26,939
 to be obstinate violent and hasty or intolerant and woeful, impatient or despairing.

35
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:35,419
Those who are previously chaste and modest, are then found lascivious and shameless.

36
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:46,229
A bright intellect is not infrequently found to be dull, a person commonly of weak mind on the other hand,

37
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:54,259
will be more sensible, while one of sluggish intellect, sometimes shows great presence of mind

38
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:59,220
and promptness, resolutions etc.

39
00:07:59,281 --> 00:08:16,189
So what he says is, both are possible.
 A person who was malicious etc. during a severe chronic

40
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:26,699
 disorder he changes his disposition, his temperament, his mental symptomatology  and becomes very nice.

41
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:39,860
 And the opposite is true. Some people who were very nice during the disease become irritable, angry etc.

42
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:55,939
Our question that we were examining is whether in all cases, we're going to search for mental symptoms?

43
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:06,449
Are we going to search for mental symptoms in all cases? Do we have mental symptoms in every case?

44
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:23,019
Hahnemann seems, according to the interpretations these teachers say, there are.

45
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:40,469
But Hahnemann does not say that the mind is always diseased; he says that the mind is always altered.

46
00:09:42,480 --> 00:10:05,139
And in paragraph 253 he makes a distinction between a healthy mind and the diseased mind.

47
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:14,901
Although not visible at all the condition of the mind and the general behavior of the patient are among the most

48
00:10:15,413 --> 00:10:25,760
 certain intelligible signs of incipient improvement or of aggravation in all diseases especially in acute ones.

49
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:40,439
You see, if you read this paragraph in connection with 210 and the sub-note of 210 you will think that either Hahnemann

50
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:50,720
is contradicting himself or he means something else. Hahnemann actually was a great observer.

51
00:10:51,680 --> 00:11:04,899
A man who had great thinking powers and could observe and then put things in order, put things in the right context.

52
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:17,259
So he says, incipient improvement however slight is indicated by increased sensation of comfort,

53
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:30,699
graded tranquility and freedom of the mind heightened courage and return of naturalness in the feelings of the patient.

54
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:40,149
The signs of aggravation, however slight, they may be opposite of the preceding and consist in an embarrassed,

55
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:48,669
helpless state of mind while the deportment attitude and actions of the patient appeal to our sympathy.

56
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:58,349
This condition is readily to be seen or demonstrated to a careful observer but not to be described in so many words.

57
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:08,979
Hahnemann says that if you have these feelings tranquility, freedom etc. you are healthy.

58
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:25,230
So he describes what is health and he describes what is disease. In par. 210 he says, the mind is always altered.

59
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:39,099
And he explains in sub-note that the mind can become tranquil etc. and the opposite can be true.

60
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:49,400
During the disease the mind can be aggressive etc. The issue seems a little bit complicated.

61
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:16,109
In par.211 he says, the state of the patient's mind and temperament is often of most decisive importance

62
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,859
 in the homeopathic selection of the remedy.

63
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:28,179
Before he has said, the mind is always altered. In next paragraph he says, the state of the patient's mind

64
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:35,760
and temperament is <i>often</i>, not always, of decisive importance.

65
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:45,189
Of course we all know that when we have mental symptoms, these symptoms are important to be taken

66
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:55,470
 into consideration for our homeopathic prescription. They are important often, not always.

67
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:02,250
What that means?

68
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:14,609
par.212. The effect upon the state of the mind and disposition is the principal feature of all diseases and seems to have been

69
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:20,689
 especially ordained by the Creator of all healing powers. There is not a single potent medicinal substance

70
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:27,599
that does not possess the power of altering perceptibly the mental condition and mood of a healthy person

71
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:35,559
 who voluntarily tests a drug. Indeed each medicinal substance affects the mind in a different manner.

72
00:14:35,659 --> 00:14:42,510
He says that all medicinal substances affect the mind as well. That is different.

73
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:54,859
If you keep on hammering a person with a substance, it will affect his mind as well, one time or another.

74
00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:04,779
This is different from saying that in all diseases, you're going to find, in front of you, you have a patient

75
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:14,740
you're going to find mental symptoms. Here in these paragraphs says something else also.

76
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:29,310
 The question is, have we proved all the substances available?

77
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:37,679
Therefore if we haven't proved all the substances, we're going to have some mental states

78
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:42,545
which are not covered by the known remedies.

79
00:15:42,645 --> 00:15:49,692
You may get a mental state of a patient belonging to a drug that has not been proved so far

80
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:53,909
and therefore it is not available. What are you going to do?

81
00:15:53,970 --> 00:16:01,539
We have already small drugs for which we do not know the mental symptoms of the small drugs.

82
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:10,979
So if a mental case belongs to that drug about which we don't know the mental symptoms, how we go about

83
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,229
 finding the mental symptoms on that case.

84
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:23,739
If we really try to say, no he has mental symptoms, therefore we're going to base our prescription

85
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:35,979
 on the mental symptoms alone and we're forcing a solution according to these mental symptoms that belong to Arundo,

86
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:42,919
we don't know Arundo's mental symptomatology but it's similar to Phosphorus.

87
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:48,889
So we fitted and we give Phosphorus.
And of course we fail.

88
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:03,360
Most of the so called diseases of the mind are in reality bodily diseases.

89
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:11,139
Certain mental and emotional symptoms are peculiar to every bodily disease. These symptoms develop

90
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:19,589
 more or less rapidly in a state of most conspicuous one sidedness and are finally transferred like a local disease

91
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:29,440
into the invisibly fine organs of the mind where by their presence they seem to obscure the bodily symptoms.

92
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:35,629
What he says here is very interesting.
He says, you have bodily symptoms?

93
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:48,859
You suppress them one way or another. You suppress them and what you see?
Mental symptoms.

94
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:54,510
And this has become a one sided disease.

95
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:05,859
And he gives an example in next paragraph. He says, is a common observation that a dangerous physical disease,

96
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:14,409
such as suppuration of the lungs he means Tuberculosis, or other destructive and acute affections

97
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:24,889
have certain mental symptoms. These are subject to rapid development and often degenerate to insanity

98
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:31,649
melancholy or raving madness where by all threatening bodily symptoms are going to vanish

99
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:35,720
and seem to be replaced by perfect health.

100
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:46,979
He has observed that when the Tuberculosis was doing better by suppressive measures, we see insanity.

101
00:18:50,120 --> 00:19:00,989
That means the disease goes into the mind and then when we treat, we see the reverse order.

102
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:05,639
We treat insanity, we see tuberculosis developing.

103
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:13,739
During the period of tuberculosis, you will not be seeking mental symptoms.

104
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:25,640
You prescribe Veratrum album for a mental case.
And after the remedy you see the tuberculosis developing.

105
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:36,240
And now you have in front of you a severe physical problem. Now you are going to search for another remedy most probably.

106
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:43,989
Are you going to take into consideration again the mental symptoms that were before?

107
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:54,379
If you do you will have to give the same remedy but this is not the case in most of the times.

108
00:19:54,440 --> 00:20:02,299
Most of the times you need another remedy and you will base the prescription, for that second prescription

109
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:11,699
you will base it in the physical symptoms of the patient. I'll give you an example, a real example

110
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,160
which I'm handing at this moment.

111
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:30,139
A severe anxiety with phobias 'what is this, what is that, I'm dying. This is cancer, no this is my heart'.

112
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:38,289
They run to cardiologist, they run to oncologist, they run to one doctor after another, something is all the time

113
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:45,819
there that is happening. They are going to die, you know this anxiety which is terrible to handle.

114
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:58,339
And then you battle with 1,2,3 wrong remedies. The 4th remedy hits the mark and then she's calmed down.

115
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:05,999
What you will see in most of the cases if it is a severe anxiety neurosis, in most of the cases you will see two things.

116
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:16,389
Especially in women I'm talking. Either you will see skin eruption or you will see severe leucorrhea.

117
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:27,969
Discharge from the vagina with itching. The vagina becomes irritated and then it's fast discharging.

118
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:44,060
During this itching and discharge, which they will call mycosis or whatever maybe the allopathic diagnosis

119
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:50,369
during this time the person feels better and better.

120
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:57,859
The more the discharge, the better she feels. So you say, 'now you don't have any fears?'

121
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:05,739
'No, I don't have any fear'. But you see now something very severe. Before she could see nothing.

122
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:12,853
She would imagine only. 'I have a pain here, a pain there, a knob here, it's developing to cancer, can you see?'

123
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:22,179
I said 'I don't see anything'. 'But it's something I get here. No, I don't see anything'.

124
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:30,689
There it comes with a severe discharge, itching, the vagina is irritated and she says 'no I don't care'.

125
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:43,429
That means the mind has become healthy now and we have to treat the discharge.

126
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:49,469
Are we going to force her to find mental symptoms during that state?

127
00:22:49,680 --> 00:23:01,899
I will tell you. I tried to treat this case for 6 months and I failed. I gave 1,2, Sepia, Carb-ac, different remedies. Failed.

128
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:12,979
Actually I was more and more aggravating the leucorrhea, the discharge. So she got fed up with me and she went to

129
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:22,059
a gynecologist and he says it's quite easy, it was not easy. She had to take treatment for a few months

130
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:34,389
and the discharge was really suppressed. For a period of time 3,4,5 months I can't remember she had no discharge

131
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:42,459
no anxiety. She was happy. Ok.

132
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:52,759
6 months later she comes again. She does not come to me, she starts going again cardiologist, oncologist,

133
00:23:52,820 --> 00:24:01,909
makes the whole rounds paying all these money and then finally after she gets the same answers as before,

134
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:11,539
take tranquilizers, take this, take that, then she comes back to me and I said ok, you start again.

135
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:19,619
Take this remedy. I know now the remedy, it's more easy for me to cure her, her anxiety.

136
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:34,189
Anxiety goes away, again the discharge is there. Now this is a case where you are treating now the discharge

137
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:39,519
and you have to treat according to the physical symptoms.

138
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:48,699
These are the guiding symptoms now but the case may come to you, straight as a case of leucorrhea.

139
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:58,939
In which case even Sepia will not have the mental picture of Sepia. You will not see the mental picture of Sepia.

140
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:07,709
In spite of the fact you see the Sepia leucorrhea, so in this case you will have to base your prescription

141
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:14,059
upon the physical symptoms alone. You do not have mental symptoms anymore

142
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:24,619
 and I will tell you my experience of 35-36 years in treating severe diseases, the systemic diseases,

143
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:32,659
 what we call the collagen diseases lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis etc.

144
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:41,139
 you get these cases which are severe and you see no mental symptoms, no mental picture.

145
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:48,619
Do you have fears? No. You have anxieties? No. You have some kind of depression? No.

146
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,129
They are quite healthy in the mental state.

147
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:04,599
 How are you going to find mental symptoms?
She is so sick, you will not find mental symptoms.

148
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:09,419
   You have to prescribe on physical symptomatology.

149
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:18,939
If you want to be realistic, if you want to be professional, if you are going to treat cases on a professional basis

150
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:28,429
that means every day you have to see 10 cases and you have to treat them, you have to be successful in 7-8 of them.

151
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:45,240
Being successful once a year and having a beautiful case which you bring and present on video is not professional.

152
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:57,939
Professional is to benefit at least 8 of 10 cases. This is professionalism.

153
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:16,360
And this is what we are aiming at when we say students need proper training.  Proper training is to attain that state.

154
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:33,749
So this is clear. The mind is altered it means it can be altered towards the right direction.

155
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:43,730
It's altered, it's modified, it changed towards the right direction. Hahnemann knew what he was writing.

156
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:56,149
Now we come to the last question where we say, what does he mean when he says that after

157
00:27:56,210 --> 00:28:02,169
a severe disease you cure, the bad character comes up again.

158
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:12,900
Is this suppression? How do you know?

159
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:24,999
There are certain factors which I will give you to judge if it is a suppression or not.

160
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:39,560
First of all suppression does not last for very long. The organism will bring back.

161
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:53,199
 Secondly a suppression will make the person who has now the mental symptoms, feel much worse

162
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:57,560
 than before when he had the physical symptoms.

163
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:07,979
The person will feel much worse now. The limitation on this person will be greater.

164
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:20,479
He was not able to work before, he was not able to function socially before, now when his physical symptoms

165
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:27,739
 are suppressed and he has mental problems, now he is worse.

166
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:40,239
But if the limitations of the person who has been cured, are less than before it means that he has come up

167
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:55,509
with his either personality traits, qualities and everyone of us has qualities as a personality.

168
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:09,779
One of us is born with a phlegmatic personality; it doesn't matter whatever happens, it happens for the others not for me.

169
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:16,579
Another one is born with much more excitable personality.

170
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:26,749
One is born with the idea that the world must be like this and acts according to this idea.

171
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:34,059
Another one is born with another idea and acts according to this idea. So there are unique personalities.

172
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:42,699
Each one of us has a different personality. That's why we can never agree totally in everything.

173
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:50,869
Each one of us has a different personality and this is how it should be.

174
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:55,609
These personality qualities they will never change.

175
00:30:55,670 --> 00:31:04,520
If you try with Homeopathy to change the personality of the person, this is totally wrong.

176
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:11,649
What you can change upon the personality?
You have some pathology.

177
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:19,499
My personality is to be excitable. What happened to you?

178
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:25,139
You listen this is your personality. Now pathology comes.

179
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:38,959
I become mentally disturbed, instead of saying what 'happened to you?' and I listen the anxiety overwhelms me

180
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:49,859
 and he says 'my God!'. It becomes much bigger this trait of the personality. It becomes pathology now.

181
00:31:49,920 --> 00:32:09,379
My natural qualities become much bigger. I cannot handle it. It's something beyond, cannot control myself.

182
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,619
'Something has happened to my child! My God save it!'.

183
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:26,109
Helleborus will act in one way, Phosphorus will act another way, Arsenicum etc will act in another way upon the same problem.

184
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:35,659
Before they could control, there was some kind of balance in this personality trait.

185
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:47,899
Now, if pathology hits the person on this level, then these qualities become accentuated.

186
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:55,180
One is phlegmatic, he says it doesn't
matter. Tomorrow it will be better.

187
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:13,869
And then something happens outside and he says 'I have no feelings. I don't feel anything'. This is pathology.

188
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:26,979
 Before they were some feelings. Now there are no feelings. It is like a stone inside. Total indifference.

189
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:38,469
They say, what do we need, why do we live? This is total indifference. It's pathology.

190
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:53,659
It's not a phlegmatic state. A person is serious and studious it is duty bound.

191
00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:09,569
But when this duty bound quality is accentuated, then you will work, work, work until exhausts himself and totally collapse.

192
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:23,329
This is pathology. And then it needs treatment of course. But you will never change the basic quality of the person.

193
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:33,299
That is why sometimes the persons looking upon themselves they don't like some of the traits which they have.

194
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:50,039
And they come to homeopath and say 'what can you do for my excitability? I'm very excitable. What can you do? I'm fast'.

195
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:57,019
You see people are fast, people are slow, born like this as a quality. You cannot change that.

196
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:06,489
Pathology can change it of course. For instance, a Veratrum album child. The Veratrum album speeds up the mind

197
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:16,440
of the child and the child is crooked thinking.

198
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:29,189
Then don't think anymore straight. They think in a crooked way. They make a question here, before they know the answer

199
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:38,659
 they put another question which is towards that direction and that direction. And you feel this child is very intelligent.

200
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:50,419
You know people have brought me the child from abroad. Our child is very intelligent, actually too intelligent.

201
00:35:52,480 --> 00:36:03,339
We are afraid because he is very intelligent. And they were right. He was in a specific school for intelligent children

202
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:15,579
and you could see that the child was keeping up this over excitability of the mind and soon the child would just

203
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:23,249
break down and will become nothing and leave the school all together. You could feel that.

204
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:36,880
The parents could feel also that. And they said, on the other hand emotionally the child is totally beyond his age.

205
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:51,939
Mentally, this over stimulation of the mind. Emotionally, immaturity. And they brought the child and they were worried.

206
00:36:52,000 --> 00:37:03,229
The child was not interested in girls. He has no interest and little things which show the emotional immaturity

207
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:15,459
 but the parents got really worried. I said, well if
 I prescribe for him, what are you going to see, not anymore first in his class.

208
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:25,699
He will become second or third. Maybe fourth.
But this will be good, don't worry. They understood.

209
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:32,600
 They said, 'you are right we are feeling the same thing that the child is going to break down very soon'.

210
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:43,779
It was 12,13 years old when he was brought to me. Now he is a healthy child. He finished his school with Veratrum album.

211
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:54,339
If Veratrum album was not given to that child, God help. He would have an insane person at the age of 18.

212
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,140
He would have insanity definitely.

213
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:19,039
In this particular case according to my evaluation, they were several factors.

214
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:29,949
There is some hereditary predisposition first of all for a child to go towards that state.

215
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:42,739
Then this predisposition is triggered or excited by several factors. One, very early one is the immunization of the child.

216
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:54,909
The child gets immunizations which stimulate the defense mechanism. They force the organism to produce antibodies.

217
00:38:54,970 --> 00:39:13,119
You produce antibodies of that type, of that type and then the child gets his first bronchitis. And there come the antibiotics.

218
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:22,899
There is a family, this was a very rich family of a European country

219
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:35,349
you know in these families how the children are treated. You are the king. The child has to perform.

220
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:48,149
So that stimulated mind feeling the obligation that had towards the parents to be good, he forces himself to stimulate

221
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:52,889
his mind and to become first or second in his class.

222
00:39:52,950 --> 00:40:06,989
You know in Veratrum album children you will see a kind of indifference towards attainment.

223
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:14,379
  It's natural for me to be like this, forget it, it's not serious, yes I'm first it doesn't matter.

224
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:30,739
The Veratrum child thinks very fast but you will see, you will perceive there is something wrong.

225
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:36,939
Even in the way they make movements.

226
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:52,029
The legs will not go straight, they will go like this sometimes, they will have round kind of movements.

227
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:06,259
I just remember one case; I was trying to treat the child of a friend and they have visited us here in Alonissos.

228
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:20,419
The child was very intelligent and very active. They have come to my house. In my house I have these things

229
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:39,149
for the mosquitoes in the doors and in the main door the net was a little broken. And I watched the child looking

230
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:56,699
at the door and saying to his mind - this is pathology - what a nice thing if I kick this and it just opens a big hole.

231
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:15,519
So my eyes caught him on thinking that and I left him, forgot it. One hour later I look and it's a big hole there.

232
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:29,259
Lefteris come here! I said why did you do that? Lefteris did when nobody was looking of course.

233
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:42,549
He was sure nobody was looking. It was 5-6 years old but what I caught is the crooked thought, then his restlessness,

234
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:47,699
then the intelligence then I put things together and say, oh my God this is a Veratrum case.

235
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:58,979
Before I arrived at that state I called the child and said 'why did you do that?', I was very nice.

236
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:06,539
I wanted to know if he can explain to me his thinking. I said 'why did you do that?'.

237
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:28,651
'I didn't do it'. I said 'yes but I saw you'. He wanted to leave. I said 'explain to me why?'

238
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:42,219
'No, I didn't do it, he left'. I called his mother, I said, because this is an imagination, I have imagined I saw him

239
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:50,539
but maybe some accidental thing has happened
 I called his mother and I said 'please find out this is what has happened'.

240
00:43:50,600 --> 00:44:00,379
And this is important for me to know. And I started putting things together for the patient. Then the mother called

241
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:04,619
and says, well he always says the truth.

242
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:17,916
All mothers! So he will tell me. She asked Lefteris, did you do it? So the mother comes to give me the feedback.

243
00:44:18,016 --> 00:44:32,860
She says 'he did not accept but he did not deny it either. Which gives me a suspicion that he has probably done it'. I said, ok.

244
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:48,650
Next time he comes and as soon as he comes 'hello Lefteris why did you do it? Why did you do it?'. No answer.

245
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:56,829
 2nd day, 3rd day, 4th day, 5th day he says to his mother 'why are we go to George again?'

246
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:05,299
He says 'I feel a heavy load because he asks me about the door'.

247
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:20,459
But then I could observe how he would move, how he would do and then it's an interesting feature on Veratrum children

248
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:39,219
how they have a heroic type of personality. The persons who would stand for others and all that.

249
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:54,899
One of these nights they were 10 children playing around my house and they got excited and they were shouting,

250
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:11,089
playing around and we were talking. I shouted, 'shut up'. All the children were just frozen. Lefteris comes

251
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:22,419
 'why you shout? You will not let us play even?' He stood up.

252
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:29,459
 We have given Phosphorus to him because he was nice so intelligent, Phosphorus...

253
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:40,859
And of course that was one of the doctors in Athens and then they come to me and I observe this and of course

254
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:45,061
observing the mental and the disposition, really there is pathology in this case. Now Lefteris is very intelligent,

255
00:46:50,250 --> 00:47:03,059
he is one of the first in his class but he is not active like this. Since then, 5-6 years now I needed to repeat

256
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:11,549
the remedy 2-3 times I can't remember. Within the 5 years whenever he has a relapse he goes again to that state.

257
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:28,080
Restlessness and the mother knows again he has been in that state, give him. Within a few days the child becomes calm.

258
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:37,610
This is a little bit for Veratrum.
