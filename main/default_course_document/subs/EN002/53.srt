1
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:35,020
Actually we are arriving at a stage
where you will discover why

2
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:39,800
many times when I see a case
and I see a follow up

3
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:48,160
I say, this case is doing well where the
whole class is saying, we don't understand.

4
00:00:49,960 --> 00:01:02,200
The knowledge of this understanding actually, will make you a real, professional Homeopath.

5
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:08,280
Because most of the cases
that have been lost so far,

6
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:16,450
 it is because of the ignorance of this
 part of theory in Homeopathy.

7
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:27,180
We have arrived at a stage where we have actually categorized the diseases in 4 groups,

8
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:37,640
12 groups we have reduced them to 4. So we
get some ideas where a pathology belongs.

9
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:45,420
 According to these categories,
 we have the reactions.

10
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:53,740
You see Kent was the first one to
have noted that the different reactions

11
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:00,290
 after the homeopathic remedy,
indicated certain definite things.

12
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:10,130
So he gave his observations.
In my experience I found out

13
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:16,720
that the observations basically
were correct but not complete.

14
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,650
That was the reason why
many times you will say,

15
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:31,420
'but it's getting worse mentally, it's getting
fears, why do you say it's getting better?'

16
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,260
And Kent said of course that when you
give a remedy there is an aggravation

17
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:46,720
on the mental-emotional and an amelioration
on the physical symptoms, then you absolutely

18
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,970
 know that the remedy has done some
harm or has done some suppression.

19
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:57,880
Is this correct, do I speak fast for you? No.

20
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:19,570
I want to give you an example of a situation. When we speak about pathology,

21
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:30,830
we speak about real pathological cases
where the problem is not only functional.

22
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:40,760
 In such cases we need the observations.
The other cases are simple cases where

23
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:47,180
the problem is functional, you give a remedy, there is initial aggravation, amelioration,

24
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:55,390
then it's finished, it's beautiful. This cannot happen, impossible to happen in a deep

25
00:03:55,490 --> 00:04:09,550
pathology. A deep pathology follows its own
rules which we try to discover in these lectures.

26
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:28,690
Let us say that pathology starts at a
point here. The person here is normal,

27
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:37,820
 then he gets some kind of pathology.
This pathology is transferred later on

28
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:44,670
 to another type of pathology. That
means here he has a duodenal ulcer

29
00:04:44,770 --> 00:05:00,640
or at this moment as a child
he gets frequent otitis.

30
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:23,960
 At the age of 22, he gets
some rheumatoid arthritis

31
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:40,730
and at the age of 42 gets some depression.
At the age of 60 he gets cancer.

32
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:55,060
 So when you treat such a case and
you prescribe correctly here

33
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:02,040
where cancer is on the physical body and
has physical symptomatology alone,

34
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,060
You prescribe correctly and you will get him in deep depression, if it is correct prescription.

35
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:13,720
 this depression is gone, the depression is
gone by the time the person develops cancer.

36
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:28,670
You pescribe correctly and you will get him in deep depression. If it is correct prescription.

37
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:34,850
And then you prescribe for depression
and he goes to rheumatoid arthritis

38
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,640
and unless you bring him back to
the point where he starts again

39
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:47,420
having frequent otitis, there
is no possibility for cure.

40
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:56,340
What happens usually in this kind of treatment
 in which you just give one remedy,

41
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:02,700
some symptoms, another remedy, some
more symptoms, you don't evaluate,

42
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:14,900
you don't know what is going on. Finally you go on and you play in between these two areas.

43
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:27,660
Never pushing back the problem. Why?
Because you don't know how to evaluate.

44
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:34,140
You don't know which remedy actually acted.
If you cannot evaluate which remedy has acted,

45
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,790
 what you do? You give up this remedy,
you have a few new symptoms

46
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:43,120
and you prescribe for the new symptoms
 and you lose the correct remedy

47
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:52,570
 what you should have done,
we shall be talking about it.

48
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:01,640
Anyhow this is a gross example
of what usually takes place.

49
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:10,350
Now I want first to go through the Kent's observations and we discuss a little bit

50
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:23,840
on Kent's observations and then we go through my observations and we'll make it very clear

51
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:31,310
 eventually what it means every time you give
a remedy and you have that reaction.

52
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:40,140
Also remember that you have to ask
questions and say, I don't understand this

53
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,950
 because if you let a gap in the
process of understanding

54
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:53,850
you will not be able to follow it up. So every
time you don't understand something or

55
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:59,510
your experience says something else, you
have to ask so we make it very clear.

56
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:06,080
 Don't leave things in the air.

57
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:22,470
What Kent says as a first observation,
what he had observed

58
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:36,590
it was a prolonged aggravation and
final decline of the patient.

59
00:09:45,760 --> 00:10:01,440
That for Kent meant that the case was incurable, that the remedy had to be antidoted,

60
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:10,380
you have to antidote the remedy he says because the patient is going to die.

61
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:26,830
If you want to place this observation in the
4 groups in which we have been talking

62
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:33,400
in which group you will place it?

63
00:10:38,410 --> 00:11:00,070
-Who says 4? Is anybody else who has another opinion? Everybody agrees that it's group 4.

64
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:21,340
Group 4 very seldom will give an aggravation.
In group 4 with the right remedy,

65
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,740
he is supposed to have given the
right remedy here.

66
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:39,170
Here the aggravation is with the right remedy. And group 4 has very deep pathology

67
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:52,360
and very seldom you will get an aggravation
until you bring up a case from 4 to 3.

68
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:01,460
Then there is a possibility of the organism
to have a reaction and show some force.

69
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:11,060
Otherwise here we have cases where
we ameliorate with the correct remedy.

70
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:18,390
But what was the observation
of Kent? Why he said,

71
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:29,970
long aggravation and no
amelioration and final decline?

72
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:41,680
You have to understand that these are
cases with deep pathology, that is true;

73
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:50,600
but pathology which has not
reached yet incurable situation.

74
00:12:50,700 --> 00:13:02,570
Once the organism has given a reaction, if you observe during the reaction the symptomatology

75
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:09,330
usually you will be able to
handle correctly the case

76
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:21,080
and slowly bring it back after
 long periods to normality.

77
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:34,630
Otherwise if you don't find the correct remedy after the first, of course there is a problem.

78
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:42,440
There is a problem that the patient may
die or the peson may go worse, worse.

79
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:58,880
 But the observation is not correct as far as
I am concerned with my experience and

80
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:10,720
once you have an aggravation,
you have the possibility of a cure.

81
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:23,860
Kent himself did not realize that in
his observations he said something

82
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:33,490
that was opposite to this. Can
anybody tell me what was that?

83
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:47,570
Some of you have read Kent.
What was opposite to this observation?

84
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:12,220
Kent has said that if you have a dying
patient and you want to make him comfortable

85
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:21,860
in the end of his life, you can use a high
potency of the right remedy and then has,

86
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:29,020
 what he called, euthanasia. He spoke
about euthanasia, that means

87
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:38,810
the end stages of diseases. He, himself
accepted that there is only amelioration,

88
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:43,840
 that means the person becomes
more comfortable but he dies.

89
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:51,020
So this is the correct observation, not
this one. You see it can't be both.

90
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,070
He has an aggravation, he dies.
He has an amelioration, he dies.

91
00:15:54,170 --> 00:16:09,460
No, if he has a possibility of aggravation then there is a possibility for a cure. Is it clear?

92
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:28,010
-The question is, you have a severe
case and you get an aggravation

93
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:31,250
and you say, ok, ok
there is something going.

94
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:36,970
And while the person is getting worse and worse and worse whilst he is having that aggravation,

95
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:41,980
what are you going to do then?

96
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:54,720
-That is true when you say aggravation
 is ok, ok, in a deep pathology

97
00:16:54,820 --> 00:17:13,890
you are going to face later on a big problem. Unless by observing the case you perceive

98
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:20,810
the picture at a certain moment of the
remedy which is needed and then you give it.

99
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:29,020
Otherwise of course it will go down, down
and most probably you will have to resort

100
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,880
these are the cases in which
you resort to allopathic medication.

101
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:52,080
There is also a possibility that you may not be able to find the remedy during the aggravation

102
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:59,260
because this is a severe case.
That means the remedy is not clear;

103
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,860
so therefore you are not going
to find easily the next remedy.

104
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:11,440
That is absolutely sure and that's why
and where you need the information

105
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:22,560
 from the Materia Medica and you need to
know how to work with the Repertory quite well.

106
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:37,520
I'll give you another example. You start here with a severe case and you have some aggravation,

107
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:48,990
cancer is very general.
I'll make another example,

108
00:18:50,250 --> 00:19:02,650
here is colitis, spastic colitis, here is
depression and here is ulcerative colitis.

109
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:16,740
You treat the ulcerative colitis and the
person is having an initial aggravation

110
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:26,440
and you give a second remedy and you
 manage start bringing some results

111
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:39,210
 and you drive the person back to fears or depression or mental-emotional problems.

112
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:43,630
 Slowly you bring them back here
and during this time,

113
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:53,320
there is a shock, a stress,
somebody dies, his father, his mother.

114
00:19:55,770 --> 00:20:08,300
During that shock, it's very unfortunate situation, you will find that the colitis will go back

115
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:15,960
 and will erupt because this is a very
sensitive situation, in which you treat.

116
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:24,510
By the time the organism is trying to
recuperate, it receives a big blow.

117
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:32,020
Where is it going to go? It's going to
go towards this direction, worse.

118
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:43,720
That is the time where you may have to resort back to cortisone, back to antibiotics,

119
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:53,200
and then you will have
 to start all over again.

120
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:11,270
But it is not possible in this type of
cases that you get strong aggravation

121
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:20,080
and then after a few hours, a few days, the patient will be well, you can forget about that.

122
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:34,350
 Usually these cases you will get them
under heavy allopathic drugging.

123
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:46,470
If this is a case of schizophrenia
and you undertake to treat this,

124
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:59,370
then you go back to ulcerative colitis, then
to depression, then to colitis, then to otitis.

125
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:15,790
So what you are observing all the time
 is how the disease was formed,

126
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:20,390
produced in history and how the
organism is behaving now.

127
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:31,530
 Is he going towards the previous state?
Does it give you indications that some fears

128
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:45,410
are developing, it is good. Well if you take Kent's observation and say, ah fears now it's a suppression.

129
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:54,990
So you see how careful you have
to be with the observations.

130
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:06,640
-Lower 3 group yes or middle
3 group, this type.

131
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:16,090
A long aggravation but final
and slow improvement.

132
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:46,110
How long? It is very important that you
are able to see the totality of the case

133
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:52,720
 and pass judgement on
the totality of the case.

134
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:03,700
What is your case in front of you?
There is an aggravation, what is the case?

135
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:18,280
Can you feel comfortable by allowing this case to go on without endangering the life of the person?

136
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:32,930
This is the question you have to ask all the time and this case belongs to which group?

137
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:45,010
You are afraid now. It belongs to the
upper 3rd or lower 2nd.

138
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:53,700
What Kent means is with one remedy,
 the one remedy you gave

139
00:24:53,800 --> 00:25:01,100
there is a prolonged aggravation but
 finally you see some improvement.

140
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:10,910
Even then you have to remember that
these cases will need eventually,

141
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:15,500
in order to improve further,
a second or third remedy.

142
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:21,580
But the first remedy if you wait long
enough to see the effect,

143
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:31,110
will show you eventually the improvement
and will show you the next remedy indicated.

144
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,920
So the long aggravation means that
the life of the person is not in danger.

145
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:47,340
This is another point where
we make a lot of mistakes.

146
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,050
You see the aggravation and you want
 to stop it and then you start giving

147
00:25:48,150 --> 00:26:02,570
one after the other the remedies and then
you nullify the effect of the correct remedy.

148
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:28,430
The aggravation is quick, short and strong
with rapid improvement of the patient.

149
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:43,560
This is very good. This is the best you can
have. Now where these cases belong?

150
00:26:47,270 --> 00:27:02,290
These cases belong from here upwards,
1 or 2 group. It doesn't apply to these cases.

151
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:11,790
You may see this even in cases of cancer,
even in cases of ulcerative colitis,

152
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:14,670
even in cases of systemic diseases.

153
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:29,770
You can see this reaction in every possible, almost every possible, nosological entity.

154
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:38,560
That means that the cancer
of that person is curable.

155
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:50,840
That is why we see some cases of cancer cured. Because they belong to the uppermost layers.

156
00:27:51,800 --> 00:28:07,310
Here you have Parkinson, here you have
M.S. and you can have this type of reaction.

157
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:27,220
So from the type of reaction that you see
 in a case you conclude about the depth

158
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:33,660
of the pathology. Don't go and say
we cure cancer therefore

159
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:41,850
 because if cancer comes with these levels
you can forget about cure in cancer

160
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:50,780
or you will have a big problem. A cancer here maybe is still curable with several remedies

161
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:58,230
and as you go down more and more
cancer is incurable of course.

162
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:08,160
But definitely each one of us have cancer
cases cured and then we generalize and say,

163
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:14,530
Homeopathy cures cancer. No it does
not cure cancer unfortunately.

164
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:24,310
We have example in the litterature
and our personal experience

165
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:36,700
where we have severe and chronic conditions.
We can have encephalitis, meningitis which

166
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:50,200
 can be cured with Homeopathy but there
are cases which are going to belong here

167
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:57,230
coming with a case of meningo-encephalitis
a case belonging to that group, forget it,

168
00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:00,570
most probably will die.

169
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:11,680
 How do you see that a case is undermined?

170
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:23,140
 Do you have some indications now
that you can say, that case I don't like.

171
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:39,140
What would be some indications?
Give me an example.

172
00:30:54,540 --> 00:31:00,370
-I think if you have a severe case and you try to find the remedy and you are not quite sure

173
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:03,660
if this is the right remedy and
you don't have any reaction.

174
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,410
No aggravation, no amelioration.

175
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:11,490
-Before giving the remedy and before
knowing the reactions from your remedy,

176
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:18,020
do you have any indications to say,
when you take the case?

177
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:26,290
Before the remedy to say, I don't like the case.

178
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:29,300
-Yes, for example when you have
cancer case and the person says,

179
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:38,170
I have not been sick for 20 years.

180
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:54,220
-This is true but there are some more
indications to point out that your case

181
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,700
is not really a good case.

182
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,750
-When you take the case and
there is no normal symptom,

183
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:10,470
everything is a mess,
 you can see nothing.

184
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:15,980
-That is also true but presupposes that
you know well your Materia Medica

185
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:23,510
because I may feel confused,
 you may feel very clear.

186
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:26,990
So it depends on the knowledge
 of the Materia Medica.

187
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:36,740
 I still ask some indications where you say,
 I don't like this case though

188
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:41,490
 the case may not look, after all, so bad.

189
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:47,150
-Maybe somebody who had many remedies
 and everything was mixed up?

190
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,810
-No.

191
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:55,840
-Maybe if the pathology only manifests on one level and it's not diffused on 3 different levels.

192
00:32:56,590 --> 00:33:02,980
-Very correct. It is the opposite actually.

193
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:11,220
When you have the ulcerative colitis in
a case where you have mental-emotional

194
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:20,750
symptomatology. Ulcerative colitis
with a deep depression, you don't like it.

195
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:32,630
Ulcerative colitis where mental-emotional is ok then that case is curable and maybe easily.

196
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:47,100
When you have severe chronic headaches
20 years, malignant headaches

197
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:55,140
 in a case where you have severe
mental-emotional symptomatology,

198
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:04,120
 the person is closed, depressed and
 fears and things like that,

199
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:10,220
 then you are going to have big
problem in curing this case.

200
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,940
Because the idea with Homeopathy is...
you are going to cure the whole person,

201
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:21,160
you can not cure only ulcerative
colitis only and leave the depression,

202
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:27,370
 you have to cure both.
But what it means to cure both.

203
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:34,500
It means that the disease is not going to
have this aggravation and then go,

204
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:46,690
it means the disease is going to follow a track. Therefore if the depression or the fears or the

205
00:34:48,440 --> 00:35:00,910
mental pathology is strong, you give
 the remedy and the colitis becomes worse not

206
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:06,220
because of the remedy but because
of the direction of the cure.

207
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:13,620
The depression becomes colitis as well,
 so it adds up to the colitis.

208
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:19,140
The person has come to be treated for
 his ulcerative colitis, it doesn't matter.

209
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:30,170
The force of the depression will be transferred, will be transformed into ulcerative colitis first

210
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:42,630
and then there is this prolonged aggravation
and then you watch and see what is happening?

211
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:51,510
Then during this tremendous aggravation
you may have to change 2,3,4 remedies

212
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:56,880
before you can bring it around.

213
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:10,540
The cases in which you have physical
 pathology and at the same time

214
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,180
the person complains or you see the person with mental-emotional pathology, these cases you

215
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:28,410
 don't like, you say, my God. And then
you have another case it comes with

216
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:34,410
severe pathology, you give the remedy,
and then aggravation, it follows very well.

217
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:42,220
But these mental cases which have
together physical pathology,

218
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,380
you have to be very very careful.

219
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:58,580
Also we shall be talking about repetition of the dose, and we will see how to manage this,

220
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:06,360
when to repeat, when to repeat
high or low potencies.

221
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:21,730
So if this aggravation number 3 is perfect. Aggravation is quick, short.

222
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:28,110
Quick, short means from a
few minutes to a few days.

223
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:36,640
2,3 days aggravation and then
the amelioration comes beautifully.

224
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:45,220
Also it is interesting to see here for instance,
the aggravation might be very severe,

225
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:54,700
 it might be more severe even
than the prolonged aggravation.

226
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:06,340
And inspite of the fact of being severe,
you see the 2d or 3rd day

227
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:16,040
everything disappears and the person
feels very well. That is very good.

228
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:25,210
-On the physical level I thought we have
always the cause on the mental level before?

229
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:37,380
-Not always. There are a lot of cases where
we don't have mental-emotional pathology.

230
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:47,010
It is not necessary to have mental
 pathology in a case, not at all.

231
00:38:52,520 --> 00:39:09,350
For instance, a person suffering from arthritis, severe osteoarthritis, rheumatism, psoriasis,

232
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:14,260
very seldom in such case
you will see mental pathology.

233
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:28,040
In case of psoriasis he comes and shows you
the knees and the elbows, I want to be treated.

234
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:35,310
You take the case and you see this person
is full of fears, anxieties, pathologies.

235
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:46,750
If you say ok I give you the remedy and you
 don't understand these principles, the person

236
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:53,700
will kill you because after a month
he will be full with psoriasis.

237
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:59,210
He will come back and say,
what have you done to me?

238
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:02,940
You say what about your anxieties,
he says forget the anxieties,

239
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:09,150
I came to be treated for this,
what are you talking about?

240
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:15,380
But if you know what are you doing and
you see the case, you say anxieties,

241
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:25,220
fears, you inform the person that if I treat
you correctly you may have that reaction.

242
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:33,770
Then if the person understands, if he does
not understand he will leave you right there.

243
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:54,990
The other thing that happens many times is
what we call mild suppression or placebo effect.

244
00:40:55,070 --> 00:41:00,840
In Homeopathy we have a lot of placebo
effects, people are coming and go,

245
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:03,700
yes I feel a little bit better, I feel this and that.

246
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:13,460
We have this a lot in Homeopathy like in every other so called complementarty, alternative.

247
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:23,350
But we know that we have not done anything
to that person inspite of the fact he says,

248
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:27,620
I'm feeling better. Where do you feel better?

249
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:38,400
What is happening after feeling
better is important to understand?

250
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:46,130
-One question to this point. Is it possible
 in chronic cases that I have a cure

251
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:50,250
without any aggravation or
 only in acute cases?

252
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:59,620
-Sure there is an immediate amelioration,
 we will talk about it later on.

253
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:09,860
In the very upper parts of the groups,
group 1, you don't have aggravation,

254
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:14,680
 you don't perceive the aggravation,
you just see the amelioration immediately.

255
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:19,410
The amelioration comes immediately when you belong to the uppermost and to the lowest.

256
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:28,140
Then in both these cases you have ameliorations, immediately after the

257
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:39,930
remedy in the uppermost group you see amelioration, after the correct remedy.

258
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:43,990
In the last group 4, you give the
remedy, immediate amelioration.

259
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:53,620
In the one case you say incurable, in the
other case you say very good health, curable.

260
00:42:55,690 --> 00:43:02,530
This is going to be for the whole
week, prepare yourself.

261
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:08,540
This is the most difficult, the most
heavy part of Homeopathy.

262
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:21,390
I warn you so you are aware of what is going on. And unless you get hold of this information,

263
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,310
you will be treating superficially and
 you will have some effects on first group,

264
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:32,840
 on the second very few cases,
on the third and fourth group, forget it.

265
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:38,580
You will just throw remedies here and
there without knowing what is going on.

266
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:43,300
-I haven't yet understood how long is a
long aggravation concerning point 2

267
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:48,110
and short aggravation concerning point 3.

268
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:57,500
-For short aggravation I said, from 1
hour to 3 days about.

269
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:09,400
A long aggravation is from
1 week to 5 weeks about.

270
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:17,360
There are cases they may have
even longer aggravations.

271
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:28,420
-We did say that in the fourth group
there are certain cases that are curable.

272
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:32,900
Which reaction do we expect
after the correct remedy?

273
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,600
If one case from the fourth group is curable?

274
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:42,690
-Then you give one remedy and he is
better, 2nd remedy he is better,

275
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:49,390
3rd, 4th, 5th remedy and he is better.
In the 6th remedy he has a reaction,

276
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:56,170
he has an aggravation. That
case might be curable.

277
00:44:56,270 --> 00:45:05,900
-So in the 4th group we always
expect an amelioration?

278
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:12,490
-No you don't expect, you
will see an amelioration.

279
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:18,620
From the right remedy
you see an amelioration

280
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:28,080
and usually the case comes
back or changes the symptoms

281
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:34,550
and again is aggravated. So it is aggravation, amelioration, aggravation, amelioration.

282
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:43,620
And if you prescribe correctly in such
cases, you may reach at a certain point

283
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:49,100
a time when there is a
reaction of the organism.

284
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:53,960
And then there is the danger of
 having a long aggravation

285
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:58,930
and then finally decline
or the possibility of a cure.

286
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:03,180
But here if you see this,
there is a possibility of a cure.

287
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:12,800
Otherwise you keep the patient
in a comfortable condition until he dies.

288
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,370
-There is a question in a case with deep pathology, you give the remedy,

289
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:26,280
there is severe aggravation,
you could think that it is incurable,

290
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:34,220
 because aggravation is difficult. What
about if you didn't give the right remedy

291
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:38,850
and producing a deep aggravation
without having amelioration.

292
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:50,070
-With the wrong remedy you cannot give
 an aggravation which is important.

293
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:57,380
You will give an aggravation
which will be little.

294
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:05,500
-It's not very good to have an amelioration
on the deep fourth level.

295
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:16,070
-It is not good, that's why the amelioration comes first and the aggravation comes afterwards.

296
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:27,350
Kent says either this remedy was
wrong or the case is incurable.

297
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:32,710
It can happen in both cases
where you give a wrong remedy.

298
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:41,670
Many times this observation is in your
practice and in our practice.

299
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:51,100
The person comes and says I'm better but
for how long? For 1 week, 2 weeks?

300
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:59,840
And then he says, I'm worse again. That means it is the right remedy and either the case

301
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:10,750
 belongs to deep pathology but the case has no deep pathology and then he comes and says,

302
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:15,680
I'm feeling better. He has some
anxiety, you give Phosphorus,

303
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:26,050
he says I'm feeling better from the anxiety.
Nothing else, no aggravation,

304
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:34,620
 the organism is strong, you see no
aggravation, you see amelioration.

305
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:43,280
You wait and in 2-3 weeks the whole situation will come back and he says I have my anxiety again.

306
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:46,600
This is the case where you will give from Phosphorus, you will go to Arsenicum,

307
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:50,260
from Arsenicum you will go to Nit-ac,
from Nit-ac to Calc and finally

308
00:48:53,010 --> 00:49:00,690
you give Agaricus and
he says now I feel good.

309
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:13,850
The other types of amelioration was when
 the remedy was close but not exact.

310
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:19,080
That's why you have this reaction.

311
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:32,860
-So if I understand you give the Phos for
the mild anxiety, the person's vital force

312
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:39,160
seems strong. The anxiety then returns
and you start with the Ars., the Nit-ac

313
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:42,590
and the Calc and then the Agar.

314
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:47,240
Are you saying that if you had given the
Agar. first, there would have been no result?

315
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:55,260
-No, if you have given Agar. first
it would be cured immediately

316
00:49:55,360 --> 00:50:03,990
but you give a close remedy, not exact. The Agaricus is the similimum but you missed it.

317
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:11,560
Instead you have given this remedy, that remedy, there is an amelioration and again back.

318
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:22,080
3rd remedy, no amelioration at all. 4th remedy, no amelioration, Kali-ars nothing happened.

319
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:30,430
Then Agar., now I'm well. That means this
case needed Agar. from the beginning,

320
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:37,420
 it belongs to the uppermost layer and we
have been prescribing wrongly all along.

321
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:42,620
-Are you saying that the presenting
symptoms when the patient comes in,

322
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:49,110
can be seen as Agar. symptoms or as
masked, it mimics Phos. symptoms?

323
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:55,230
-No, for an expert will be Agar. symptoms.

324
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:57,750
-No problem.

325
00:50:57,850 --> 00:51:04,750
-When we analyse the case here in the
class, many times I say the remedy,

326
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:08,910
the whole class has another idea.

327
00:51:09,010 --> 00:51:18,680
This is between the difference in knowledge.
 So why happens this?

328
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:24,370
Most of our patients stay with us
because of that observation,

329
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:29,270
first amelioration and then aggravation.

330
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:38,410
A case I received they say, I gave Nat-m
he was better, I gave Ign he was also better.

331
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:44,000
Then I gave Phosphorus then he was better.
But finally after 3 years he comes back

332
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:50,760
to the same state. He is in the same
state as he was in the beginning.

333
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:56,150
Then we analyse the case and say
 'this is a case of Cajuputum'.

334
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:05,920
You give it and the case is progressing.

335
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:17,330
-I haven't quite understood the point 5.
First amelioration and then aggravation.

336
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:22,190
Do you only observe it when the
remedy is close but not exact

337
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:30,720
 or do you have it in the group
4 when the case is incurable?

338
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:40,960
-Yes, that is also. I'm giving these
observations by Kent just to show you

339
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:45,990
that they do apply but they are not complete.

340
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:56,020
Afterwards I'm going to give you the
complete reactions or so called complete.

341
00:52:56,120 --> 00:53:07,110
We still have questions but at least I have
found out through these observations,

342
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:17,580
I was also messing up cases. Because in the beginning I did not know all of what I know today.

343
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:29,680
So I messed up a lot of cases. I saw some
fears developing and then give this remedy,

344
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:33,260
give that remedy just to get away from the fears.

345
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:46,360
The fears are in a process of curing.
 Fears appear or even depression appears.

346
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:51,910
-I stick to another point. You said if
 you give the wrong remedy,

347
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:55,780
even you don't have real
deep severe aggravation.

348
00:53:55,880 --> 00:54:03,320
But I remember the case of S., she
made a proving of Manganum I think

349
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:09,780
and afterwards she had 2 years
 of deep depression she said.

350
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:17,860
-Mild suppression by the wrong remedy.
 Mild suppression means a suppression

351
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:29,980
which will last for a period of time. This is
true, but if you know what you are doing,

352
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:36,200
 then you will know that this is a suppression.
If you take the whole case and you

353
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:54,700
will see the totality of the case and especially take into consideration the fact that

354
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:58,430
the person has mental-emotional symptomatology.

355
00:54:58,530 --> 00:55:07,250
Unfortunately today with the western population there are very few people who are really

356
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:13,340
balanced in their mental-emotional side.
So when they come to us to be treated

357
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:21,600
for something of the physical body,
always there is something behind

358
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:24,950
which is mental-emotional disturbance.

359
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:32,420
 There are many times in the population
of the western people, not in Asia,

360
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:42,850
not in South America, not in Africa. Only in America and in Europe we have this problem.

361
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:48,060
 There, the population is much more
easy to treat because it is physical

362
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:56,140
pathology mostly, the remedy is clear,
you give the remedy and it is gone.

363
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:06,950
-But just before you said that it is quite
frequent that it is only physical pathology

364
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:10,580
and not mental-emotional
pathology behind it.

365
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:17,980
-If you take the whole population of the
earth, the most is physical pathology.

366
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:23,910
-So you draw a distinct line between
East and West population?

367
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:29,700
-Not distinct because there with
 the vaccinations they get.

368
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:36,460
The Arabs get vaccination now,
the Africans all these people get

369
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:42,690
vaccination, antibiotics, they are going
to enter in the state in which we are.

370
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:52,690
But as a whole if I see the population
of the earth, the pathology is mostly

371
00:56:52,790 --> 00:57:00,450
on physical pathology
and people are balanced.

372
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:14,750
In our countries, you come from Germany,
 do you want me to give you percentages?

373
00:57:14,850 --> 00:57:19,470
-Only if you see this frequently or
if it is always mixed up?

374
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:27,940
-I will tell you something. We see and
everyone who treats, see the sick people,

375
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:31,980
does not see the healthy ones.

376
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:38,750
That is one thing that you cannot make
very easily. Amongst the sick people,

377
00:57:38,850 --> 00:57:46,390
the population which is affected
mental-emotional is 80-85%.

378
00:57:46,490 --> 00:57:50,490
-In most cases even when you treat
physical cases and people come to you,

379
00:57:50,590 --> 00:57:53,320
you look for something behind it?

380
00:57:53,420 --> 00:58:03,410
-Yes mental-emotional pathology.
Not in Greece so much.

381
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:08,170
You see for me it was much more
easy to treat the Greeks.

382
00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:14,040
When I treated the Greeks, as
I said, I have treated them

383
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:18,390
with a group of medical doctors
 that they were taking the case.

384
00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:25,540
I would go and see immediately the
remedy, I look, I read a few things

385
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:31,500
and then I would go to the next.
Very seldom I would stuck to a case,

386
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:38,830
 confused. Then when they come for
feedback, much better, much better.

387
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:46,550
Then when I go to America to treat,
 that was a different story all together.

388
00:58:46,650 --> 00:58:49,740
I said my God what is going on here?

389
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:59,220
Then when I saw people of the
 North hemisphere,

390
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:04,380
I saw this phenomenon where
diseases have being affecting

391
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:08,840
mentaly-emotionally
a lot of the population.

392
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:14,050
 In India I wouldn't see mental
emotional pathology.

393
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:24,720
Practically, you see somebody who is totally crazy, it's ok. But here it is different.

394
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:31,420
-Could you please repeat what you said
 before about the patient who has

395
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:37,100
ulcerative colitis and also depression.
You had said, if I remember correctly,

396
00:59:37,270 --> 00:59:42,340
 that the depression ameliorates
and the colitis aggravates.

397
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:47,480
What am I doing in such a case?
Do I have to change the remedy then?

398
00:59:47,640 --> 01:00:14,230
-I have to repeat again and again a few
 basic things so you get the correct ideas.

399
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:22,740
This is the physical,
this is the emotional.

400
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:26,620
We say, in this example, ulcerative
colitis and then depression.

401
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:33,660
Ulcerative colitis is very severe
 that means endangering the life.

402
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:49,660
It is more high, it's here. The depression
 which comes with that intensity,

403
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:59,260
severe depression, suicidal depression.

404
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:07,730
Now we have depression which comes
 here also which is not so severe.

405
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:23,110
 When you treat here the ulcerative colitis
 and then it goes down to depression,

406
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:33,100
that is a cure, why? The person tells you,
 I'm going back to the depression

407
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:38,350
which I had 10 years ago.

408
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:51,020
That depression is on a level lower
 than the ulcerative colitis.

409
01:01:51,120 --> 01:02:16,310
But you are treating now a colitis which
at the same time has a mental problem

410
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:28,690
 which is quite high. Now he comes for the colitis, his mental problem is not so much bothering him

411
01:02:28,790 --> 01:02:39,360
 or maybe it's covered or not so aggressive. You give the remedy and if the remedy is correct

412
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:48,360
here, this force of the disease is going to be added to that and you will see this.

413
01:02:50,170 --> 01:03:01,700
While this is getting better or lesser,
 the more this is, the lesser this becomes.

414
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:11,740
If this is deep and severe, this aggravation
 is going to be very, very strong.

415
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:17,950
So there are two different cases.
 I talked here about a depression

416
01:03:18,050 --> 01:03:22,620
that is in the process of the
developing of the disease.

417
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:29,660
Here we have a combination, at the
same time when you take the case,

418
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,580
a combination of mental-emotional symptoms.

419
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:39,800
You have emotional symptoms here,
 mental symptoms there

420
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:44,540
and physical symptoms on that level.
 What is going to happen?

421
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:55,260
The balance will be that this will even
 come up there. Once these are reduced,

422
01:03:55,360 --> 01:04:03,240
then the physical symptomatology
 will come very high.

423
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:21,340
-In these cases it seems possible that this condition can be very serious on the physical,

424
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:25,410
eventhough mentally and emotionally
 there is amelioration.

425
01:04:25,510 --> 01:04:34,280
What in terms of case management can be done so that the patient doesn't fall into decline?

426
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:56,010
-Well here in such cases for a period of time you may have to rely upon allopathic medication.

427
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:10,140
-So in that case you treat ulcerative
colitis and the patient is getting into

428
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,830
depression back and
it's a good progress.

429
01:05:12,930 --> 01:05:19,860
So the question is what are you doing?
Are you waiting, not changing the remedy?

430
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:28,980
-This case will need several
remedies before it can reach here.

431
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:34,930
This case belongs to this group
we have said, several remedies.

432
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:49,550
Once the depression is there you have to be careful not to be in a hurry to prescribe a remedy.

433
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:55,700
Wait, give placebo until you are certain
that this is the remedy for the depression.

434
01:05:56,040 --> 01:06:00,800
 Then you give it and then
you see beautiful things.

435
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:14,040
-Before, you just said that there is
some cases that it might be that one

436
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:20,370
has to take allopathic remedies
for a certain period of time.

437
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:26,620
But what about if that leads to relapse
 that he has more problems

438
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:30,220
on the mental-emotional level again?

439
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:36,270
-This is true, it may end up to a relapse
so you may have to start all over again.

440
01:06:36,370 --> 01:06:46,070
That is a possibility. The other possibility is that inspite of resorting to allopathic drugging,

441
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:57,320
 still once the bad period is gone. Because
 in the life of people there are periods

442
01:06:57,420 --> 01:07:05,820
which are good and bad. For a person who is really sick, a bad period makes a big difference.

443
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:13,980
So if you try to cure this person under
this bad period of time and still insist,

444
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:22,710
you may have a problem eventually.
But if you pass this bad period by relieving the

445
01:07:22,810 --> 01:07:28,750
symptomatology through chemical
drugs, then you try again.

446
01:07:28,850 --> 01:07:35,210
This is the cases of severe asthma.
 Severe asthma under cortisone

447
01:07:35,310 --> 01:07:42,680
or in general cases under heavy
cortisone you will never be able

448
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:47,410
to manage to take the cortisone out in one
time. You take out the cortisone, you treat,

449
01:07:47,510 --> 01:08:02,170
you take out, you treat and then
you resort again to cortisone.

450
01:08:02,270 --> 01:08:10,680
The third or fourth time is before
 you can take out the cortisone.

451
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:25,300
There are periods, for instance, for asthma
 bad period is spring and autumn,

452
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:34,450
during spring and autumn even without any other stressor, this stressor makes very bad situation.

453
01:08:35,830 --> 01:08:42,780
Then you resort to cortisone, then
you take it out and then you treat again.

454
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:46,830
Then it comes September, October,
again there is an aggravation,

455
01:08:46,930 --> 01:08:56,190
you resort but everytime you will see
that with less amount of chemical drugs,

456
01:08:56,290 --> 01:09:04,760
you will be able to manage such cases.
We are talking about really severe cases.
