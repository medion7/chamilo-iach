1
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,460
In the program which I see here, I see a few things which we have not spoken about and

2
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,320
I would like to touch upon these matters.

3
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:52,220
One is handling of remedies that means many times you have the remedies yourself and you're dispensing

4
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:59,390
the remedies and you have to be
careful how you do it.

5
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:14,300
First of all it is good if you handle the remedies yourself, you don't give a prescription, not to touch the remedies.

6
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:25,480
When it comes to the point where you have to do it, empty on a piece of paper with a little bit of sugar powder,

7
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:34,280
so the little pills won't run away
but don't touch every time the remedy.

8
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:44,490
At this moment we don't know whether touching a remedy means you have been affected already by the remedy.

9
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:52,330
So if you are a Homeopath and you're doing every day this, you have to be careful not to touch the remedies.

10
00:01:53,080 --> 00:02:00,750
The second thing is that if you keep the remedies in your house, you have to keep them away from the sun.

11
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:13,640
It  has been recorded that remedies that stay exposed to the sun many times are spoiled.

12
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:25,580
Another point that you have to be careful is when you open in the room the remedies, where you have your bottles,

13
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:43,020
you don't have any kind of perfume or when you have shaved and then you put some cream and your hand is still

14
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:52,490
full of this perfume don't handle the remedies. You have to wash your hands totally so there is no perfume at all.

15
00:02:53,750 --> 00:03:03,400
Because perfume may sometimes spoil the remedy, so you don't give a remedy and your bottle is finished.

16
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:12,880
We know such cases quite a lot that they have been spoiled even in the pharmacy.

17
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:25,160
You have also to be careful and to demand from the pharmacies that they keep their remedies away from the camphor

18
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:33,930
or certain medicines which have
strong perfume in the pharmacies.

19
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:41,160
You have to tell them that the remedies should not be opened and closed in this environment.

20
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:57,420
Another thing, that we don't know yet whether it will affect your remedies when you travel,

21
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:04,500
 the remedies pass through these X-rays.

22
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:15,720
We do not have yet information that the remedies are spoiled but it is good if you travel and you have your kit to say

23
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:25,040
'I don't want to pass it, this is what it is, it is homeopathic remedies, please let me go without passing through the X-rays'.

24
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,130
How you administer the remedies?

25
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:55,970
The best way is to dilute your remedy into a little bit of water and let the person drink the water.

26
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,880
This is the most immediate action.

27
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:19,540
Sometimes the remedy is given in a capsule and before this capsule is dissolved in the organism, there is no action.

28
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:30,900
If the pharmacy will give them a capsule and you want immediate action, like the case with acute insanity

29
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:42,060
I had to put it in water and you see the
moment that you throw the water,

30
00:05:42,160 --> 00:06:01,720
(in cases where two people are holding someone in an acute state), the action is immediate.

31
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:07,440
So this is the best way, in water.

32
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:28,540
Now if you have one dose, 10 pills, 20 pills and you dilute in some water and you start giving a little bit of that water

33
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:37,240
every one hour, that is the same as if you have given everytime a new dose.

34
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:49,900
That means the original dose which you diluted in water, given 5 times it is like you have given 5 doses.

35
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:03,420
Exactly equivalent to 5 doses. There is no difference between this and every time giving some tablets, pills or whatever.

36
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:12,680
So water is a repetition, if you need a repetition you can do it this way, by diluting in water and repeat.

37
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:29,960
In severe cases almost invariably
you have to repeat the potency.

38
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:51,820
Also in acute cases with high fever, repetition
 will be needed. You can do it through water.

39
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,640
 This is the best, it is the most immediate action.

40
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:25,190
Now of course you can give remedies through tablets, through pills, through liquid, there are remedies

41
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:36,820
you buy them in liquid. If you take one drop of this liquid and you put it in water and you stir it,

42
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:45,450
you have a remedy which can be used 20-30 times.

43
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:54,700
Of course it is good not to put a full glass of water and to put one drop.

44
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:01,880
If you just put this, then you put 5-10 drops.

45
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:20,190
Here also you may be using low potencies, medium potencies or high potencies.

46
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:44,600
For high potencies, the best method for preparing them will be not the continuous flushing of water,

47
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:54,180
where they flush water through a bottle. But anyhow forget about the negative. I will tell you the positive.

48
00:09:54,280 --> 00:10:11,500
When you want to prepare a remedy, the best way to prepare a high potency is through one bottle in which

49
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:25,600
you have put the water up to that point and here you have used this cork and then you shake this bottle

50
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:39,570
at least 10 times and the best way is to empty this bottle and refill it with twice distilled water and start again.

51
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:56,630
Now what happens is, when you empty this bottle here on the sides are some drops staying. This is the Korsakov.

52
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:08,460
I want to make you understand why this method is better than what they call, the Hahnemanian method where

53
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:27,930
sometimes they put a pipette here and they draw one portion and then they have another bottle

54
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:42,200
and then you put a new bottle with distilled water that has been taken from the middle of this bottle.

55
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:56,200
In this case where you use several bottles, 100 bottles, 1000 bottles, in this method you may not at a certain moment,

56
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:08,400
you may not be taking potentised
 amount of distilled water, why?

57
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:28,350
Because as you dilute one after another, they form small clusters, which is an entity, a very minute.

58
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:37,930
These are molecules of water coming together because of the solvent. They have proven that these tend to

59
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:43,850
stick around the sides of the bottle.

60
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:57,170
So emptying this bottle and refilling it, you are much more certain that what has stuck here are those clusters

61
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:04,210
that have been formed because of potentisation.

62
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:24,520
So the Korsakov method is the best, as long as they do it properly of course; it will be the most effective.

63
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:38,030
The Hahnemann potentisation, as you may understand, is taking from these molecules around here the water,

64
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:47,530
you don't know whether these molecules contain these small clusters on which the information is carried.

65
00:13:52,360 --> 00:14:01,250
In any case experience has shown that the Korsakov method gives reliable results.

66
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:18,680
Another question that we may
discuss is the placebo question.

67
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:33,480
Do we give placebo? Must we give placebo or we must give just one dose and forget about it?

68
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,760
I will give you my experience.

69
00:14:50,280 --> 00:15:07,060
 In Greece at least, in Athens, invariably we give a series of placebo after the initial potency.

70
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:19,100
And it has been proven that even people who they know about it they like to take it. It doesn't matter.

71
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:31,240
The issue has been discussed and a lot of people may know that they take placebo, still they will take it regularly.

72
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:46,090
This issue I was discussing in America and my students in America said, the American people are not as gullible

73
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:58,540
as the Greeks, so we cannot bluff them.
We only give them one dose, nothing else.

74
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:10,410
 That proved to be a bad habit. The reason was that the patient did not really understand that maybe

75
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:20,180
the effect of the remedy he took, will be after a month, as a result asking within this period of time for another remedy

76
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:27,920
and the doctors would give him
another remedy and another remedy.

77
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:38,740
It was very surprising to Bill Gray who came
in Athens and stayed with me for two years.

78
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:47,270
He left his patients for one year, we were prescribing a remedy and said ok and they could not find him anymore.

79
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:54,140
When he came back after a year to take follow up's he said, George the results were phenomenal.

80
00:16:54,840 --> 00:17:02,140
I said, do you see now what you're doing? He said, yes I realize I was giving remedies after remedies too frequently,

81
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:10,780
spoiling the cases. When I left them for a year
 I see almost everybody...he came in an exciting state he says,

82
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:19,980
'you're right we should have given placebo'.
What is the idea of placebo?

83
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:31,180
The idea is to buy time, to make the patient feel he is taking a medicine, therefore you wait.

84
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,930
This is the message we're sending through placebo.

85
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:43,190
The message is that the effect can't be immediate. You have to wait to see the effect.

86
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:47,670
The longer you wait, the best you
will feel that is the message.

87
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:52,250
And why not using the placebo.

88
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:09,380
So I would recommend to give placebo in all your cases even if you're treating the Prime Minister of America.

89
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:35,220
When you treat anybody, it doesn't matter how clever may be, these issues they cannot know, it's a terra incognita for anybody.

90
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:48,100
It's an unknown area so you can tell this is my way of treating. Do you like to do it? Yes. You don't like, bye, bye.

91
00:18:51,000 --> 00:19:02,510
There is no kind of 'shall I give, shall I not give?'.

92
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:15,580
Because the patient will perceive that, he will understand your hesitation. Somebody I give, somebody I don't give.

93
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:23,600
You just make it a habit, either
yes or no. If no, don't give.

94
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:38,640
A lot of people they will not attribute
 the cure to yourself.

95
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:45,860
Later on I got a massage and
after the massage I was better.

96
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:50,950
But you have been taking massages
 for 5 years, nothing was happening !

97
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:06,380
You know the story with the little boy and his father who said, George does not have to give you a remedy.

98
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,540
He has to just bump with the
 hand and you will be alright.

99
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:19,820
I said, why did you say that ? Because when I brought my son with asthma you just made like this and said,

100
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:27,780
you will be alright and next day he did not have asthma. We brought him from Germany, he had asthma for 3 years,

101
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:34,300
you bump like that and the night
 did not have asthma. He said, you don't remember?

102
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:45,970
I asked him to open his mouth and put a powder and he says, I can't remember and he was

103
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:56,190
 circulating the story in Athens. I telephoned
and said, what are you doing?

104
00:20:56,290 --> 00:21:05,110
He says, George honestly I don't remember.  I was absolutely sure that you did like this and the boy was ok.

105
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:11,420
He said, he was cured, you finished his asthma right there. I said, yes but with the powder.

106
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:17,410
You cannot persuade but if
 I have given one month the placebo!

107
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:31,220
Many times you give a remedy and placebo for a month, nothing happens. And you continue to give placebo

108
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:36,700
the second month and the third month with the placebo he says, now that was the best remedy.

109
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,580
Why they say that? Because it took
3 months for the organism to come back.

110
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:52,340
Therefore you need this placebo,
otherwise you face a lot of problems.
