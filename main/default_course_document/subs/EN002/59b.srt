1
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:03,740
-This is something that we see many times. If somebody comes here and you hear 'I took this remedy

2
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:14,430
and I was better for a while I took that remedy and I was better', 3, 4 remedies have good reaction

3
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:30,470
but very short time. We hear that many times and usually it means that the remedy was close but not exact.

4
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:39,060
 So the patient also does not discriminate exactly what he feels or how he feels better.

5
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:51,300
I have noticed something. I know a doctor who does it every time he sees a patient.

6
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:59,220
If you give Natrum muriaticum to every case almost invariably they will say, I feel better psychologically.

7
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:08,230
The reason is that everyone goes through some kind of stress and grief and Natrum muriaticum has an effect

8
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:19,240
 on this emotional level, I feel better. But the complain actually is not the physical complain or the headaches.

9
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:27,920
 I feel better psychologically but the headaches are the same, I feel better psychologically but my stomach is the same.

10
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:37,600
That kind of reaction you don't like.

11
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:45,260
As I said yesterday, you give a remedy
 and the person says the next day,

12
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:59,630
'I'm much better thank you very much'. You don't like this because either the case is incurable

13
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:08,340
 in which case we have group 4.
Any remedy you prescribe in group 4,

14
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:17,060
any correct remedy will bring an immediate amelioration. Then you don't like because this is group 4

15
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,930
or the remedy is close but not exact.

16
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:37,960
What you like in Homeopathy always is to observe an initial aggravation from the remedy.

17
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:47,860
And this is natural according to our understanding of how the remedy acts because many times

18
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:57,140
they ask us how you don't have a
 theory, how your remedy acts.

19
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:07,260
I always say, we have the most logical theory possible. It cannot be more clear and what is more clear is,

20
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:23,020
when the organism produces five symptoms and through these symptoms is trying to bring balance

21
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:32,530
and you find a remedy that produces also these five symptoms and it pushes the symptoms.

22
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:39,300
The organism produces symptoms, you give a remedy produces similar symptoms, what it does?

23
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:52,990
Aggravation. It makes the symptoms more strong and then we have the amelioration. What is more logical than this

24
00:04:53,090 --> 00:05:02,140
by saying that the organism is trying by itself to bring about order, it cannot. Therefore every day

25
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:12,540
it produces a headache, 10 o'clock the
 headache comes. It comes to bring about order.

26
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:21,900
What has happened? Different things, one is that the person had a rupture in their love affairs

27
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:33,940
and after this the headache stayed and it comes 10 o'clock in the morning. Then you give the Natrum muriaticum

28
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:43,140
what do you expect? The next day she will say, I went to bed with headache, I never had such a terrible headache.

29
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:59,010
It's perfect. But if she says, she has this headache for 10 years and you give the remedy, and she says next day I feel better....

30
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:06,000
You expect that after a month at the
 latest you will have a relapse.

31
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:17,270
Of course such prescriptions they can
keep your patients coming.

32
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:34,420
Even for a few days I was relieved, the patient will come back to you but you know the remedy is incorrect.Why?

33
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:52,960
Because there was no aggravation. You may say it might be correct and the remedy was antidoted after 15 days.

34
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:04,820
That is a possibility also but in such a case where the person feels quite good immediately after the remedy

35
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:10,290
without real aggravation it belongs to that.

36
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:17,720
The headache cannot be strong,
really strong, malignant headache.

37
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:29,150
I started having a headache some days ago. Why? Because I got some grief.

38
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:33,920
You give Natrum muriaticum and the grief goes away and the headache goes away without aggravation.

39
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:40,150
That is group 1. Do you understand?

40
00:07:47,830 --> 00:08:08,680
These observations have to be seen according to the groups because these observations do not apply to all the cases.

41
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,580
We have to make different
observations for different cases

42
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,970
and we have to make a very detailed
description of the possible reaction.

43
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:29,230
It will be too many that's why we try to put together and generalize and give the main ideas.

44
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:41,300
Then you have to think for yourself but in a case
where there is a relapse after two weeks,

45
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:47,060
then you know that your remedy was acting superficially, that is the most probable.

46
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:56,060
The second probability is the case is really incurable and these cases that are really incurable

47
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:03,660
may not have such a severe
pathology at the moment when you prescribe.

48
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:11,830
At the moment you prescribe it doesn't seem to have a very big pathology, forget it, you may try for years

49
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:23,840
and you will see the organism is never going to pass a threshold, why? Group 4, it feels weak, it feels exhausted.

50
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:44,320
'I have a pain here, my head is not clear'. If you hear this abstract symptomatology, you don't like.

51
00:09:46,080 --> 00:10:01,460
You like to hear I have cancer but every night I perspire here and I like sweets and my feet are cold and I have cancer.

52
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:09,920
You say, thank God take Calcarea carbonica and the cancer is gone and you get the other case where he feels

53
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:24,720
exhausted, tired, 'my head is not clear and sometimes I shiver and this and that', you try, you try and no picture is formed.

54
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:34,450
You give a remedy, you have this reaction, even the best possible prescription will have this reaction,

55
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:44,150
better for a while, then back again. Better for a while then back again but stays on the same level, there is no movement.

56
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:06,800
-I don't understand one thing. You've said
 that in incurable cases from group 4

57
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:12,190
if you give the right remedy there
 is only amelioration.

58
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:19,760
-Only amelioration and then aggravation and then a relapse or a different remedy.

59
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:27,570
-But now you have said that also
there we expect an aggravation.

60
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,470
-Where?

61
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,480
-In group 4.

62
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:49,380
-Let us take the possibility that this case is incurable. Then if you have a relapse what you are going to do?

63
00:11:49,480 --> 00:12:03,630
You are going to give the same remedy. This is the case where you have pains from cancer, you give Sulphur

64
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:09,160
and there is an amelioration on the pains and then there is a relapse, you give again Sulphur,

65
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:13,100
 and then amelioration and again a relapse.

66
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:22,080
 Second time and then the third
time he says, 'I'm not anymore hot'.

67
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:28,010
Change the remedy and you have to find
 the next remedy, it is Calcarea carbonica.

68
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:32,940
Better, relapse, Calcarea carbonica.
Better, relapse, Calc.

69
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:43,350
And I said, there is a time that maybe even in such cases, there is going to be an aggravation after treating

70
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:56,760
 the person for 2-3 years. Then there is a possibility for cure, because it jumps from group
 4 to group 3.

71
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:13,020
-Could that be a possibility that you have a patient and you give a remedy, you repeat the remedy and after

72
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:20,280
 taking the remedy for example for
 the third time, there is an aggravation.

73
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:25,800
Is there a possibility afterwards
 that the body goes up?

74
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:37,810
-That's a good question. That is another possibility also where they don't belong really to group 4.

75
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:46,180
This is a case where there is a possibility for a cure for that person, he is somewhere here

76
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:53,940
and what happens sometimes is that you give the remedy and there is an amelioration.

77
00:13:54,040 --> 00:14:04,040
And you give again and there is an amelioration and the organism by these 2-3 times repetition is already strengthened.

78
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:14,420
The 4th time there is aggravation with the same remedy, that you wait, you wait because this aggravation

79
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:25,380
being in this group, is going to be long aggravation, 2 weeks, 3,4 weeks. You let it go, don't stop it.

80
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:58,520
-I had a patient and I gave him a remedy. At first he had an aggravation, then amelioration and then he was alright.

81
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:08,620
But what is the case when I repeat the remedy and every time he has an aggravation, is it ok or I don't know?

82
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:21,170
-There is no such case but let us say that there is an aggravation and then what? Tell me, after the aggravation what?

83
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:42,290
-Every time when I repeat the remedy he had aggravation and then always amelioration.

84
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:56,270
-It's rather improbable but it shows that the organism comes back to where it was originally.

85
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:12,930
Even after the amelioration there is a kind of relapse but this relapse gets the patient

86
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:23,340
 to the same level as he was originally.
Where usually it does not happen, we see that

87
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:30,190
 with an aggravation and then an amelioration the patient stays for a long period well

88
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:37,260
then there is a relapse, then you give the remedy again the same, group 1, then he stays well

89
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:47,440
for a long period of time. This can happen. So if you treat a group 1 case, you may have this

90
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:53,800
 but in a very long time, in years,
you just prescribe a few times.

91
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:09,740
You see a Natrum muriaticum case, constitutional in this group,

92
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:18,460
 because here in this group Natrum
 muriaticum will act superficially.

93
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:23,920
 It will take away, better psychologically
and then we'll see what happens.

94
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:33,580
In the upper groups, Natrum muriaticum which is indicated as a constitutional remedy, will have

95
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:47,600
a big reaction in the beginning and then an amelioration for long period of time. Here, Natrum muriaticum

96
00:17:47,700 --> 00:18:05,400
will act for a while, then the person will go to some other remedy. In the upper case, the person is structured

97
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:19,160
 to be sensitive in its very structure. Therefore a grief on that Natrum muriaticum constitutional person

98
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:30,160
will have a deep effect where a grief on these levels will not have such deep effects.

99
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:46,020
A grief here can bring a relapse on the Natrum muriaticum state. In the same way that Calcarea carbonica

100
00:18:46,120 --> 00:19:02,510
which has a sensitivity on their back or the glands, if they lift something they will bring back the sensitivity

101
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:08,600
but again as a Calcarea carbonica situation.

102
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:17,800
Where here in this group, there is some grief,
 there is some amelioration after Natrum muriaticum,

103
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:31,960
there is again some grief and the reaction goes towards Staphysagria, towards Aurum, different.

104
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:42,680
In this group the reaction on the grief will go back to the same condition.

105
00:19:54,760 --> 00:20:03,580
- About what you said about Nat-m in group 1 or 2, if you have a relapse after grief and you give Nat-m

106
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:08,400
again, does it mean that she will
 not have an aggravation?

107
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:24,460
-She can have an aggravation in case the organism is on the lower group 1.

108
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:32,490
If the organism is here, she may not have an aggravation.

109
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:43,430
You're having this reaction immediate but never in a month you will have a relapse in group 1.

110
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:52,500
-I was only relating to the question she said. She said if you give a remedy you can have an aggravation.

111
00:20:52,600 --> 00:21:01,670
-This can happen a few times where the remedy belongs to this here, where you have an aggravation,

112
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:15,780
 then amelioration, for a long time but this organism actually if you look through, you will see the next remedy.

113
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:27,200
Because already on this group the lower 1 there is a possibility of another remedy, Sepia, let us say.

114
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:33,940
If you give Sepia then it stays
 for a longer period of time.

115
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:47,220
The idea is we make as less
as possible, mistakes.

116
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:55,580
 Not that we don't make mistakes, this is not possible because there is the human

117
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:06,660
element and there is this driving force on the
part of the patient who is pressuring you.

118
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:14,800
You get in America and they get in the telephone and they demand that something will be done immediately.

119
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:29,330
They are not patient, they have not learned that this waiting, as an idea is not conceivable in the American people.

120
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:37,240
They have to do everything fast, everything efficient and everything should have been done yesterday.

121
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:46,060
This is a rule so why not my headache? Why even to have a headache? You told me you are going to cure me.

122
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:58,070
They pressurize you. If you don't know the rules you are going to make mistake and mistake

123
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:08,200
until you are disappointed and then you say,
let's go to Vithoulkas to see what is he doing?

124
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:15,220
-To have it clear in my mind, do I have to decide is this a case finally incurable or not?

125
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:21,670
I got a remedy which has slightest
aggravation how can be sure that is curable?

126
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:33,300
It's not group 4. The slightest aggravation after the right remedy excluded the group 4 on all levels, that's right?

127
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:40,450
-I don't understand your question. If he has a small aggravation....

128
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:51,420
-I have to decide between group 4 upper level
 or group 3 lower level. And I have a slight aggravation.

129
00:23:51,520 --> 00:24:00,970
-So you say, there is some aggravation and after that you have an amelioration, then it's not group 4.

130
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:31,140
-You acurately described the American mentality regarding their treatment. I was wondering

131
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:41,300
whether you might suggest in those cases where
it's very clear that treatment I have given out

132
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:48,750
many liters of sac lac to patients and have found out that this only works for a little period of time

133
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:54,610
they threaten, they want to call their lawyers, their headache is still there etc. What would you recommend

134
00:24:54,710 --> 00:25:03,570
 in terms of any short of palliation so that eventually the pathology can be tended to.

135
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:12,100
-If anybody tells me that they will take me to court I will eliminate his symptoms within 24 hours.

136
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:22,260
I can do it very easily. You give 3,4,5
 remedies and all the symptoms are gone.

137
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:30,500
 For a period of time bye, bye sir I cure you now. What is going to happen next month I don't know.

138
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:37,170
 I mean if they are so stupid as not to understand, then it's not your problem.

139
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:48,540
If somebody wants to die, he wants to die.
I know cases where inspite of the fact they
 have been so well,

140
00:25:48,640 --> 00:26:02,890
 when they are under a crisis they will rush to take allopathic drugs, what can you do? It's your karma, follow it.

141
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:17,770
I have said many times 'I can do nothing anymore for you'. Actually this was a case

142
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:34,100
where he came with very high blood
pressure and I gave Adrenalin to that case,

143
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:40,800
you remember the case you were
taking the blood pressure.

144
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:58,070
There was some effect but then there was a relapse, the blood pressure started going up again,

145
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:08,070
I prescribed Sulphur, no effect. I said, the blood pressure is too high, I'm sorry you go back

146
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:14,360
to your pills or you go to the cardiologist
 to prescribe new pills.

147
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:24,030
She resisted, she did not want,
try for the last time. I said ok.

148
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:43,420
I have given before Belladona with little
effect, then I changed the remedy again.

149
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:56,320
After Adrenalin now I thought this is a case of Belladona. I prescribed Belladona 30, repeated doses.

150
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:12,200
She has a party now for the last month she says, the blood pressure from 1.80-2.10 it has come down to 1.40 steady.

151
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:27,370
She couldn't believe it. She sent faxes.
Her karma is good, this is the only reason.

152
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:36,990
 I said, now I'm going to try again Belladona which I have given before and it did not work, how many

153
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:49,730
possibilities you have for success? Yet as I told you, if you don't find the right sequence of remedies,

154
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:56,270
the second remedy or the third will
not bring about the desired effect.

155
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:06,990
You have to find the first remedy which may appear to do almost nothing but it says now the case

156
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:18,400
 is a clear case of Sepia, a clear case of Belladona, you give it and the effect is there.

157
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:29,980
Many times I have done this and people insisted, No. With Krishnamurti I told you, he was dying, he could not breathe.

158
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:47,750
I said, finished, I cannot do anything anymore,
 a man 75 doing like this. You can die today, tomorrow,

159
00:29:47,850 --> 00:30:01,320
forget it let him take the antibiotics. I said, we
call a doctor from Lausanne from Switzerland.

160
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:15,380
'Is he going to help you?', 'I said no, he is going to give you antibiotics because my medicine

161
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:25,210
does not seem to do anything, as you see'.
He said, 'no, you continue'.

162
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:35,450
He puts you a lot of responsibility because one more wrong remedy and the whole thing is finished.

163
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:43,360
 And I don't know by the will of God, who
wants these things and you find the remedy

164
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:54,010
you prescribe and he was out the next afternoon. I tried in the morning Phosphorus and in the evening he was up.

165
00:30:55,350 --> 00:31:01,500
I went there, I didn't see him in the room,
I thought he died and they took him away,
he is not in the room,

166
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:10,580
 it's not possible that he got up by himself
to go to the bathroom and I was trembling.

167
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:23,620
I saw him coming from the bathroom, 'what did you give me', of course he was still very thin

168
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:27,760
but you could see the action of the remedy immediately.

169
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:45,750
If he had taken antibiotics he would have died right there, no way. He lived another 20 years from 67-87.

170
00:31:45,850 --> 00:32:05,080
It was 67 in Switzerland and died in 87 in Switzerland or in England I think. This is their life.

171
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:11,720
You say, do you want me to take away your symptoms? Ok I take away your symptoms.

172
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:29,780
 Of course in a case where there is danger of the life of the person you don't think about this or that. You say, we do this to save

173
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:36,020
 the life of the person and then
you try again that's a different story.

174
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:40,890
But in America for little things
they can take you to court.

175
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:11,460
This is a continuation of what we have been talking before where the patient says,

176
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:25,670
I am better but for one week or two weeks and then comes an aggravation or change of symptoms,

177
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:32,280
 more aggravation, more change of symptoms.

178
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:47,340
Then this is an indication that you do not have a good case in your practice and it's going to give you a lot of headaches.

179
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:29,460
Something else also that I have to tell you is that these observations, are observations of 20 years, I wrote them in 78,

180
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:37,200
 they were published in the science of Homeopathy. 20 years ago I made these observations

181
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:46,510
which were based on a gross understanding not on a finer understanding of what is happening

182
00:34:46,610 --> 00:35:01,180
 with the human diseases and in conjunction with the remedy. So we have now to adapt it

183
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:09,040
to the new understanding of having the different levels on which these things apply.

184
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:16,940
-Is it possible that a patient with panic attack who belongs to group 3 can be treated with 3 remedies

185
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:22,100
and within 6-8 weeks she changes to group 2?

186
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:39,060
-Yes sure it's possible. The thing is that it was not a panic attack so deep. You have panic attacks,

187
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:53,020
it can be of different depth. This panic attack in which after short period of time it goes to group 2,

188
00:35:53,120 --> 00:36:08,720
this is not such a deep anxiety state to bring panic attacks of such type that belong to group 4.

189
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:19,130
 In Group 4 you will see panic attacks
 which they will drive you crazy.

190
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:30,460
You give remedy after remedy, very good prescriptions and better and better and another remedy,

191
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:41,890
better, back, another remedy. I have battled
with such cases for long periods of time and

192
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:48,680
you may need careful prescribing for 5-6
 years before you can get them out of

193
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:57,500
the panic attacks and you get other panic
 attacks which belong to the upper 3 group.

194
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:04,200
With one remedy they go back into group 2.

195
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:18,110
And in these panic attacks you will see
 the hyponchondriac element so strong.

196
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:29,240
'I breathe some air'. 'What do you mean?
Air is to be breathed'. 'Yes but it was a little bit different

197
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:36,700
 so I can not breathe now. The air
was different', 'What was different?'

198
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:45,700
'I don't know something was in the atmosphere'. This, you don't like to hear. This kind of descriptions

199
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:56,560
you know you're going to take a long period
 of time before you can handle such cases.

200
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:08,400
-Can you answer for me if it's the action of the remedy that brought the intensity of the symptoms

201
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:13,380
so high or is it that the patient was
 going this way, anyway?

202
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:22,160
-He was going this way anyway. There is no question. In incurable cases the patient is going to die.

203
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:37,520
And it's bringing out the direction towards
which
 he would be developing his pathology.

204
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:53,380
The possibilities of course, if you are careful, that you see the new symptoms and a little bit more clear and a little bit more clear.

205
00:38:53,880 --> 00:39:05,000
And you will have time to do this with deep anxiety states. You have time because there is no danger of life there.

206
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:16,480
What it has died, has died and it's part of the emotional side and the fear has overtaken and replaces everything.

207
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:26,200
They cannot feel any joy. All the emotions are replaced by tremendous anxiety.

208
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:33,630
-I'm still bothering with this group. When there
 is after the remedy no aggravation,

209
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:36,980
and amelioration and
 then deep aggravation.

210
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:47,860
Then it must not be possible that I find the remedy to take care of the aggravation before the amelioration.

211
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:52,550
When you see the case and its sequence
 you see the body is in a state where

212
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:57,660
it can have a heavy aggravation and then
 I found a remedy and this aggravation .....

213
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:20,160
-This we call it wrongly aggravation. This is a deterioration of the situation. It's going worse you can see everywhere.

214
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:31,640
New symptoms you try to find and then you prescribe again. It's not a matter of aggravation of the initial symptoms.

215
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:49,830
-In this case is there not the possibility that in the beginning we gave a close remedy and then there was an

216
00:40:49,930 --> 00:41:00,820
aggravation, first amelioration then aggravation but to bring up this aggravation the organism has to have strong vital force.

217
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:10,480
-It could be, we have discussed about this previously and you can explain it in this way.

218
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:18,610
If you can explain it in this way that means there is an aggravation but now the remedy is clear.

219
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:32,630
The aggravation then is good but usually in
such a case it doesn't precede an amelioration.

220
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:41,030
You give the remedy and gets the aggravation, and the aggravation brings out another picture which is good.

221
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:51,890
But this preceding by an
amelioration is very doubtful.

222
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:14,100
-May I ask one question? Sometimes it is difficult to decide what is the aggravation. Is my case deteriorating

223
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:20,260
 on its own or is this an aggravation? It is a
 child who is very backward mentally but is presenting

224
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:33,320
to be a very difficult child in behavior. He has a grandmother who is in bed, he would put fires in the room,

225
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:37,700
 she's aphasic and he would stuff her ears and her nose so she doesn't breathe, he would lock her

226
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:47,260
in the bathroom, he would create difficulties for his mother. You can see that he is physically over grown but mentally...

227
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,730
-He is a real devil. How old is he?

228
00:42:50,830 --> 00:43:00,820
-He is 14 but from the size of him you would think he is 21. He was abusive, he used to throw tantrums

229
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:07,700
whenever he is contradictive, he would burst
 out with anger and he would break things.

230
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:15,950
 I gave him first Anacardium which did not seem to do nothing and then I gave Bufo because sexuality

231
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:27,660
coming up but I was waiting for some reaction to the remedy. But if he aggravates he would more violent?

232
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,960
-Yes.

233
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:37,320
-The only physical pathology he has is tonsillitis and he does develop acutes, it's not like he is in group 4

234
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:46,280
where nothing comes up and only mental happens. So if I have given him Bufo 1M and he was violent

235
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:52,020
 but it was not sustaining this aggravation
 he seemed to go back and forth.

236
00:43:52,120 --> 00:44:02,260
-I will tell you in that particular case, for instance you gave Bufo because he has a symptom which is characteristic.

237
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:09,600
He is angry when he is contradictive. If you
go to the Repertory you see, this is Bufo.

238
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:18,470
 In spite of the fact that Bufo
 has to have masturbation a lot.

239
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:20,140
-He had this.

240
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:35,140
-A lot ok. Now what I expect from this to happen, if Bufo is close enough it will give an aggravation on mental level

241
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:47,790
 and the child may become even more nasty.
 And then the picture of Stramonium maybe will develop.

242
00:44:47,890 --> 00:45:01,110
Then you give Stramonium and the child will come to normal and then the possibility of Tuberculinum later on.

243
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:17,440
Even if Bufo is correct, most probably will not cure the nasty, this child is very nasty,

244
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:28,470
 it has criminal tendencies. Criminal tendencies as pathology we think of Stramonium,

245
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:33,010
we think of Belladona, we think of Hyoscyamus.

246
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:39,300
But in this case if Bufo makes it even more aggressive then the possibility of Stramonium will

247
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:46,510
 rise and think of Belladona
and Hyoscyamus as a possibility.

248
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:59,510
-I have a question. I have a child who is very aggressive and the physician says that it may be that this child

249
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:09,380
 is schizophrenic. He has severe ear infection. How can I really differentiate to which group he belongs?

250
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:20,780
-Schizophrenic? I don't think that he is schizophrenic. You see the fact that some doctor calls somebody

251
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:30,930
 schizophrenic, it doesn't mean he is really schizophrenic especially if the child is autistic. How old is the child?

252
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:35,560
-12 years.

253
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:48,490
-12 years a child should be called autistic, not schizophrenic. Even by the diagnosis I see that

254
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:52,990
it doesn't come from a specialist.
It comes just from a doctor.

255
00:46:56,360 --> 00:47:18,970
This child is curable unless he is autistic.
 Autistic is different, he doesn't understand what he is doing at all.

256
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:34,460
-Yes, he is very aggressive,
he takes a knife and attacks his mother.

257
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:40,620
-Very good.

258
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:53,470
 When a child has impulses to kill
 and at the same time he has otitis, the remedy is

259
00:47:53,570 --> 00:48:07,480
Mercurius Solubilis 50M and then the child will be better in everything. It is not a schizophrenic child.

260
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:43,580
-Do you really take the risk if the
child really kills his mother?

261
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,380
-He will never kill the mother.

262
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:54,540
-But there is aggravation on the
 mental level. What does that mean?

263
00:48:54,640 --> 00:49:13,080
-No, no it doesn't mean that he will kill the mother. If a child 12 years old kills his mother, it is by accident most probably.

264
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,560
-How do you treat such a patient?

265
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:30,740
-You see the organism, let us say, has these 5 symptoms. It has desire to kill, this is the highest but

266
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:34,600
 it has this, this, this and that symptom as well.

267
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:46,790
So let's say you give the correct remedy to
 give you more graphic, more vivid example.

268
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:56,010
Let us say, this is high blood pressure
23 and you give a remedy

269
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:02,710
 and you say you have aggravation
but not in this symptom.

270
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:12,860
The organism is strengthened so it decides this symptom is very dangerous for me, I bring it down immediately.

271
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:23,260
So what I will do? I will raise this one, I will raise this one and that one but this dangerous one I'll bring it down immediately.

272
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:40,510
The same way, you have a child he is in convulsions, he has 40,5 fever and he is in convulsions,

273
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:47,300
you give the remedy Belladona. The convulsions stop; then what is aggravated,

274
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:58,780
 the urine, the perspiration is aggravated, all the other symptoms which are not dangerous to bring

275
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:10,080
a reaction further and you see
 immediately the convulsions come down.

276
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:21,360
The fever may go 40,7 but without convulsions.

277
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:37,380
-George, Bufo is in none of the contradiction rubrics?

278
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:52,640
-Misunterstood, angry, irritability
 when misunderstood.

279
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:59,300
This is quite frequent also and then there
 are several possibilities even in that.

280
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:16,070
Don't give up the remedy which you have
 studied so well. Try to find out what exactly has happened.

281
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:29,070
Maybe he took the remedy and put the remedy together in her bag with her aromas and maybe the remedy

282
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:40,400
  from the pharmacy was spoiled, so she did not take a remedy. You may find out that the pharmacy ...

283
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:55,100
We had one pharmacy in Athens by that time I was prescribing. I had several times told the pharmacy that

284
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:11,750
your Rhus tox 10M is finished, your Phosphorus 1M does not work, replace it. The pharmacy should have taken action

285
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:18,770
 to replace that but he has a bottle, it opens every time, he gives from that bottle; then there is a time

286
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:27,600
when the bottle doesn't work anymore because the remedy has been antidoted in the bottle.

287
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:39,790
 And you don't give a remedy actually. How did
 I know? If it is a case of typical Rhus tox,

288
00:54:39,890 --> 00:54:43,990
 I know the typical Rhus tox case
 it's not possible that it doesn't work.

289
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:56,020
Give 10M, ok give 1M, ah beautiful. Of course you telephone and you say, your remedy Sir is not working anymore.

290
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:08,120
So it's not always that your remedy is far off, of course it can be that your remedy has no effect at all

291
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:18,780
and the patient also is not sensitive to produce any kind of changes, therefore you have to change the remedy

292
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,720
but otherwise you be careful.

293
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:35,230
-Do you remember the case of the farmer we saw first time in Lindau and after 6 remedies he had always this reaction?

294
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:38,850
How can we explain such a person?

295
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:39,900
-No effect?

296
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,800
-No effect, nothing. He was here.

297
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:44,550
-Ah the Ignatia case.

298
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:51,720
-Yes and everytime he doesn't ameliorate, doesn't aggravate, like taking sugar, it doesn't
 do anything.

299
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:55,150
Six remedies I think he took until now.

300
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:11,820
-That's true it's a puzzle for me also. It's a puzzle why? Because I think there are two things happening.

301
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:23,220
One is, that the problem is quite deep. The second is he doesn't want to admit of any change.

302
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:30,800
The reason is most probably that if he admits of any change he's afraid you will say, ok you are good now, go.

303
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:40,920
And he wants somebody to hold on. In this
 case I don't believe he has no change.

304
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:51,900
I believe he is much more calm but how much?
 If he doesn't tell you, if he doesn't give you the information?

305
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:59,510
If he always say, I am the same, I am the
 same, it had no effect, I don't believe that.

306
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:11,060
Of course you will tell me maybe there is a remedy which needs this kind of attention,

307
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:22,020
maybe we need to give Pulsatilla because of that and maybe one day somebody will just give him a remedy and he may admit it.

308
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:28,580
-I wonder if he just want to keep the symptomatology. That was my impression after the Ignatia because

309
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:38,320
we found him a little bit better but somehow he keeps it. He doesn't want to let lose, is that possible?

310
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:50,510
-It is possible but we can not excuse ourselves by saying that. Because even that is pathology, wanting to keep

311
00:57:50,610 --> 00:58:00,750
 his symptom is pathology. So if we find a remedy which needs to grasp somebody like Agaricus, like Pulsatilla,

312
00:58:00,850 --> 00:58:10,750
like Baryta carbonica, weak people who want to rely upon others. If we decide this is a problem,

313
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:22,800
then we may go to that direction and prescribe.
Still I feel that we have not been able to find the correct remedy.

314
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:28,390
 Unfortunately this is one and the other
 is that he does not want to cooperate.

315
00:58:28,490 --> 00:58:34,900
He does not want to state any kind of change.
 It's not possible with all these remedies that

316
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:40,760
 he does not have any change at all,
 it is not possible.

317
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:50,180
-If you have given the right remedy and the patient says, there is no reaction, is it sensible

318
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:57,090
 to give remedies in different potencies like C200?

319
00:58:57,190 --> 00:59:16,480
-Yes, you can go higher and higher and higher. Who was in Munich? In the house called Natura medicine?

320
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:46,300
In this case, in this hospital I was presented a case of lupus erythematosus, in which I prescribed Pulsatilla 200.

321
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:59,210
Then I got the report later on from the doctor who was treating the case and he said: we gave Pulsatilla 200

322
00:59:59,310 --> 01:00:11,990
 and there was no effect, at all. Then we gave Pulsatilla 1M, waited one month, there was no effect at all.

323
01:00:12,090 --> 01:00:21,950
Then because we believed that the analysis was correct we insisted and we gave Pulsatilla 50M

324
01:00:22,050 --> 01:00:26,300
and then there was a beautiful cure.

325
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:38,630
You see somebody says, 200 no effect,
1M no effect, 10M no effect. You give 50M.

326
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:48,940
These people did it by themselves
they did not consult me but they thought ok,

327
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:53,670
 if Vithoulkas made the analysis and he said
 this, then we have to insist. They insisted.

328
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:08,860
-I have the experience that if the patient wants to get better, he gets better. I had once a patient who was Rhus-tox

329
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:21,540
in C30 and she was taking this continuously and it was acting and when it finished they put new on top of it

330
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:29,700
but it was just different pharmacy and it didn't work and she could differentiate and say, it doesn' t work anymore.

331
01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:37,940
-If you find out that one potency doesn't work, how long would you wait?

332
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:58,980
-One month. Sometimes you have reason to wait for longer but in one month you know if there is any change.

333
01:02:00,570 --> 01:02:14,230
Actually those who read this case, Lac Felinum. We had here a meeting and there was a case with suicidal disposition,

334
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:26,670
a very peculiar behavior, he was acting like a cat. He loved the cat, he dressed like a cat, he would go out

335
01:02:26,770 --> 01:02:36,100
in the street, he was a homosexual. He would climb a tree and stay there and say, 'I am a cat'. He would climb

336
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:42,060
on the roof of the house and stay there.
 'Come down'. 'No, I am a cat'.

337
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:54,800
 We discussed this case in a teachers meeting and I suggested actually Aurum bromatum because

338
01:02:54,900 --> 01:03:07,370
it is a very peculiar person antisocial, with suicidal tendencies. Then somebody else says, Hyoscyamus

339
01:03:07,470 --> 01:03:28,660
 and then one man following the idea of Sankaran by that time, he said, this is a perfect case of the signatures

340
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:36,450
which is a cat- Lac Felinum.
Why don't we give Lac Felinum?

341
01:03:40,690 --> 01:03:42,510
There was an arguement.

342
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:49,540
And the doctor who presented the case was a doctor who worked in the center, a Greek doctor.

343
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:55,860
In the end of the discussion he
said to me, what shall I do?

344
01:03:55,960 --> 01:04:04,340
I said, this is an interesting case we have to try
 to see whether Lac Felinum will have an effect.

345
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:11,960
Shall I give Lac Felinum?
I said, ok give Lac Felinum.

346
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:20,270
I asked him after a month, he said,
 no effect. I said, give again.

347
01:04:20,370 --> 01:04:28,270
 2 months, no effect, 3 months passed
 and I kept this case, I wanted really to see

348
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:36,470
whether it will give any reaction and I kept
 it long and the child committed suicide.

349
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:52,710
I mean there was no effect. That's why I am so angry with these ideas which come as a fantasy

350
01:04:52,810 --> 01:04:58,980
and have no base on real symptomatology.

351
01:05:06,550 --> 01:05:15,460
-I want to ask if you can antidote a remedy with your mind. I have a patient who is only curious

352
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:19,800
about Homeopathy but she
really doesn't believe.

353
01:05:20,570 --> 01:05:22,790
-Then there is nothing to be cured.

354
01:05:22,890 --> 01:05:32,050
-And I found the right remedy and she says there is no effect. If you want to give a higher dose, she says

355
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:36,860
I don't want I rather take allopathic medicine.

356
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:53,040
-I will tell you something which is very strange. For a person to do this, it must be quite sick in the very beginning.

357
01:05:53,540 --> 01:06:00,640
He comes to you and says, 'you give me a remedy and I will prove to you that it doesn't work.'

358
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:10,940
 This very fact...why she comes? You see the twisting of the thinking of the person,

359
01:06:11,090 --> 01:06:18,640
 I go there and I prove that the remedy is incorrect. That means he is already quite sick,

360
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:31,670
  he is already in group 4. Therefore, in group 4 the remedy is not clear, the reaction is not going to be strong etc.

361
01:06:33,230 --> 01:06:44,630
But let anybody come who has a clear cut remedy and let him tell me, 'I don't believe' but as long as I'm satisfied

362
01:06:44,730 --> 01:06:54,890
 that the remedy is clear. I say, very good don't believe, take the remedy you will see.

363
01:06:54,990 --> 01:07:02,660
I told you with the CIA man, he was a very strong, hard man. He was looking at me,

364
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:14,350
'this child of 22 he is going to cure me?'
He didn't believe, he was very strong.

365
01:07:14,450 --> 01:07:20,420
 'It is not possible, I've been to the best doctors
 all over the world and I came now in the basement,'

366
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:34,140
  it was in a basement by that time in Athens. He had come from America, he has a huge diamond factory in NY.

367
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:45,340
He was coming in the basement of Athens, he said to me later on, he comes after a month and says, 'I am the same'.

368
01:07:49,010 --> 01:08:05,760
'You are the same?'. 'Yes'. 'Take this', but I noticed some hesitation in his voice in certain symptoms.

369
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:10,430
Very good, placebo.

370
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:28,950
Second month he comes, 'I am the same'. He admits that he is 'maybe better in that symptom, maybe I don't have that.

371
01:08:29,050 --> 01:08:37,310
 But this is nothing. My main symptom is the same'. The third month, I told you the story many times,

372
01:08:37,410 --> 01:08:40,400
he comes with a ring, a diamond ring.

373
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:53,100
He says, 'I want to see you privately'. I knew he was an agent, a CIA man. I said, he is going to kill me.

374
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:10,290
He says, 'I bring you a present for your wife because you made me free', the third month.

375
01:09:14,130 --> 01:09:28,620
He doesn't believe, he says, it's not possible. He confess to me all this negative thinking. He said, 'I could not perceive'.

376
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:36,940
I said, you almost misguided me in the beginning when you said, you are almost the same. You almost lost

377
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:46,990
your possibility to be cured, you know that? He said, 'it was not possible for me to think that I was going to be cured from you'.

378
01:09:47,090 --> 01:09:55,500
He still telephones me, he is 80 years old now and he still calls me. Hello George, do you recognize my voice?

379
01:09:55,600 --> 01:10:06,140
I say, yes how are you? I am ok. He never had problems with panic attacks. Terrific panic attacks.

380
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:19,090
But the other case where the mind is really deteriorated and it is twisted and things like that;

381
01:10:19,190 --> 01:10:32,780
they can do anything, they can tell you lies. These people will not give you a feedback, which is correct,

382
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:39,120
how can you proceed. It's group 4,
 how can you proceed?

383
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:47,100
-And the problem is the fear is so big that
 maybe she is afraid to take a remedy.

384
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:53,780
The fear of pain and fear of the remedy.

385
01:10:57,660 --> 01:11:06,270
-If she is afraid to take the remedy you
cannot do anything. What can you do?

386
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:29,810
-If you have another case that you gave a remedy, I had a case of Carcinosin. Physically she hardly had

387
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:36,900
anything but she thought she had ruined her body because she used to put a finger in her mouth to vomit

388
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:44,830
whenever she had a big meal. But she saw her parents who used to do it before, as a child she saw her parents doing it,

389
01:11:44,930 --> 01:11:53,090
so she adopted it and today she is 40 years old. Now, the last two years she is afraid that she will get cancer

390
01:11:53,190 --> 01:12:03,130
because she used to do it but actually everything is fine with her. And I gave her Carcinosin because she is duty bound,

391
01:12:03,230 --> 01:12:12,220
 she is exactly Carcinosin and she told me that she had a little bit aggravation, she slept for 2 days

392
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:19,220
and then she felt the best that she felt ever in her life. And she kept calling me every day and I gave

393
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:27,820
a placebo because she needs to take something and every time I leave the country, she develops a headache,

394
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:38,240
very strong headache with migraines but she never had headaches before in her life, that's what she says.

395
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:53,610
-She has changed levels; she produces another symptom out of insecurity because you are her security

396
01:12:53,710 --> 01:13:04,940
so you maybe thinking of another remedy like Agaricus, like Phosphorus, like Pulsatilla, like Arsenicum

397
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:08,500
all these remedies can have such a reaction.
