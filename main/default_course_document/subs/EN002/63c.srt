1
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:40,340
I have promised you to discuss the possibilities of taking away people from drugs

2
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:49,930
and how you take them
if they are under chemical drugs.

3
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:18,150
So in this category of people under
allopathic druging we have two groups.

4
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:29,300
One group and a second which we treat differently. If you want to really treat somebody who is

5
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:38,790
under constant allopathic druging you
have to put them in one of these two groups.

6
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:48,470
The first group is a group where if you stop
 the medication, there is danger of their life.

7
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:20,640
Such cases are asthma cases, heavy asthmatics who are under cortisone, you don't stop their medication ever.

8
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:37,070
Children under cortisone, don't stop the medication. You know George from America, what happened to him?

9
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:44,430
He had one such case, he tried to stop
the medication and the child died.

10
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:53,300
He had for years problems, court cases etc.
 and the court case was not from the parents.

11
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,920
It was from the hospital, from the
 doctors of the allopathic hospital.

12
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:14,210
And the medical association took his license.
So why you should as a Homeopath go to such extremes

13
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:22,960
and endanger the life of the
 patient but endanger your life as well?

14
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:42,240
The second group which is
dangerous to stop is.....

15
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:47,910
heart cases.

16
00:03:53,030 --> 00:04:07,900
Heart cases with high blood pressure at the same time heart case is very dangerous to stop the medication.

17
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:31,620
Third group which is quite dangerous to stop is the epileptics.

18
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:49,440
Grand mal epileptics which are taking antiepileptic drugs for years and you try to stop the medication,

19
00:04:49,540 --> 00:05:01,360
they could go to status epilepticus and then you will see permanent paralysis or permanent damage

20
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:15,340
which you will be very sorry to see. I will tell you a few ways of dealing with such cases but let's first categorise

21
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:26,620
and clear in our mind all the cases that
are dangerous to stop the medication.

22
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:34,050
-What about petit mal?

23
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:48,110
-Petit mal goes to that group, not to this group.

24
00:05:54,310 --> 00:06:01,050
Which is another group?

25
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:28,470
-Diabetes?
-Diabetes is belonging to this group

26
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:52,990
it's more easy to stop or to get involved with the diabetes case because you have the possibility of insuline

27
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:57,890
and reducing the insulin and control it.

28
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:14,680
But if you go and stop immediately the insulin and then try homeopathically,

29
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,110
but we'll see how you handle it.

30
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:26,090
Here the danger is imminent, you're going
 to be definitely in big problems.

31
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:41,680
-People who have got transplantation of vessels and who have taken the medication, not to get them rejected.

32
00:07:48,870 --> 00:08:04,190
-Immunosuppressive. It's very interesting but they don't come to Homeopathy.

33
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,190
-Psychotics?

34
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:35,730
-The psychotics, the deep psychotic cases which they have started around young age, around 18,20

35
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:46,880
and for 10,15,20 years are under heavy drugging if you try to stop such cases you will have a lot of problems

36
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:55,160
not only the danger of him dying but the danger of other people dying because of them.

37
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:13,010
They can kill somebody or they can be very aggressive and a problem for the society; so we don't want to create such situations.

38
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:38,410
-Chronic impediment of organs like
failure of the liver or kidneys?

39
00:09:40,540 --> 00:10:09,250
-In the kidneys when they are in kidney dialysis in blood purification, you don't stop them from being to the dialysis

40
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:34,960
but with let us say, beginning stages of liver cirrhosis where they may be taking interferon

41
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:49,470
they don't have anything else to do. Either interferon or transplantation of the liver

42
00:10:49,570 --> 00:11:10,170
in such cases you can interfere with Homeopathy and if the interferon is giving some results, you wait.

43
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:16,790
But if the interferon treatment is not giving a result, then you can stop and you can start with

44
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:28,520
homeopathic treatment without having
the eminent possibility of the death.

45
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:38,500
-What about AIDS?

46
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:58,690
-AIDS in the last stage where Kaposi sarcoma has appeared or they get these pneumonias,

47
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:07,440
pneumonia Carinii one after the other they have reached the end. You can do very little but I don't think

48
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,190
any treatment can do anything.

49
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:21,600
But in this stage I would not suggest that you get involved with such progressed cases of AIDS.

50
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:40,930
Just out of experimenting more you can do it but when we have a prodromal syndrome like the AIDS related syndrome

51
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:46,440
 where we have lymphadenopathy, where we have some types of diarrhoeas, exhaustion etc.,

52
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:54,420
at that stage you can interfere with Homeopathy and Homeopathy can have some good results.

53
00:12:54,470 --> 00:13:02,910
I don't know how far they can go because the cases we have treated so far they have shown an improvement

54
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:11,370
but not a cure which will be established
by laboratory examinations.

55
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:43,180
If a case of multiple sclerosis is under cortisone, do not stop the treatment to start yours. Wait until the patient is himself

56
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:54,450
disillusioned because in multiple sclerosis cortisone will show an immediate effect and the patient gets some hope.

57
00:13:54,550 --> 00:14:02,040
Once he sees that the relapses are coming back and even more frequently than before,

58
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:11,940
  then they get disappointed then that is the time you can enter. Otherwise you will stop here, they immediately

59
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:18,340
go into paralysis and then they blame you.

60
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:24,160
MS under cortisone.

61
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:48,680
In these cases here, insulin here, here thyroxine, these especially whatever is a replacement

62
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:56,930
of the natural hormones it is not very
bad for the homeopathic treatment.

63
00:14:57,030 --> 00:15:12,410
That means they can continue having the insulin but you will have to check immediately after your remedy,

64
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:21,420
you will have to check the levels of sugar because they may go the opposite way, they may go under normal.

65
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:35,940
In such case you can reduce the insulin immediately and see whether you can actually get away from the insulin.

66
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:48,920
So in these cases you reduce immediately
 after your presciption, after checking.

67
00:15:50,240 --> 00:16:06,770
Now in petit mal you cannot check but you can reduce and see whether the frequency of the attacks is increasing.

68
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:16,310
If that is the case then most probably your remedy is incorrect and you have to search for another remedy.

69
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:35,560
With liver cirrhosis, liver disfunctions in general fatty infiltration, degeneration in all these cases

70
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:45,430
the allopathic therapeutics do not have a solution.

71
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:54,150
So whenever there is no solution from the allopathic point of view, you can interfere there is no question.

72
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:11,650
If you want to try to get away the remedies from such people as these ones here, the strategy should be

73
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:20,460
to try to see if there is still the picture of a remedy. If there is a picture of a remedy

74
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:26,710
and you feel quite sure about it, then you
can tell them that you will start treatment.

75
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:33,780
Otherwise you tell them, 'I cannot do anything'.
 If you take their case and it is totally confused,

76
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:39,850
it is best to tell them 'we can do nothing, Homeopathy can do nothing'.

77
00:17:39,950 --> 00:18:03,140
If the case seems clear,  then you use a medium potency like 200 and you use it frequently, every day 3-4 times the day.

78
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:19,460
You use this for, let us say, one week. After one week you advise the patient to start reducing the cortisone.

79
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:30,930
If by reducing the cortisone the condition remains the same or even better, then you continue frequent repetition

80
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:38,880
and at the same time, slowly reducing the doses of cortisone.

81
00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:14,010
In such cases you will have the problem that the case may look is going well and it may also reach a point

82
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:23,530
where you got him out of cortisone
totally and his condition is tolerable.

83
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:37,790
But these cases are very sensitive and let us say, they find themselves in a polluted city like Athens or in Kosovo

84
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:46,180
where the pollution is tremendous,
then the crisis which arises suddenly

85
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:56,960
is going to be very dangerous and very severe and sudden and you have to be prepared for that.

86
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:02,800
It's not a case where you can just forget it,
ah now it's out of cortisone, it's doing well.

87
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:08,900
With the least provocation the
reaction is going to be very severe.

88
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:20,390
And therefore you have to be in contact and to be lucky to give immediately now the new remedy

89
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:28,250
or the old remedy in order to stop this crisis.

90
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:34,750
Otherwise they will go back to cortisone
and then they will start all over again.

91
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:42,070
The more this happens, the more times you get them back to cortisone, the more difficult becomes the case.

92
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:53,340
That's why in these cases we say,
it's better to not get involved.

93
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:10,110
With heart cases it's different. It seems that the heart has better possibilities of responding in homeopathic treatment.

94
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:35,390
And also here with heart conditions we have the possibility to check with a cardiogram whether the case is doing better etc.

95
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:46,400
Here, we don't have much control of the case; it depends only on the subjective symptoms of the patient.

96
00:21:52,500 --> 00:22:00,830
Also in asthma cases where you see emphysema, where the lung has expanded and cannot

97
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:09,660
anymore function, it is very improbable
that you're going to help such cases.

98
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:19,170
Here in the heart is different. I believe that Homeopathy can help most of the heart cases.

99
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:30,760
Now if they are under allopathic drugging you have to do the same but not as high as 200.

100
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:42,950
I would go the highest when I start with 30, repeating 3-4 times per day or even less than 30.

101
00:22:44,980 --> 00:23:01,390
The heart does not respond very much to high potencies but I have seen cases which are really amazing, with heart conditions.

102
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:10,920
A remedy excellent is Aurum iodine,
Kali-arsenicum also.

103
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:37,640
I would say it would be easier for
 Homeopathy to show results in heart cases

104
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:46,590
where we have gross pathology than a
 malignant type of high blood pressure.

105
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:54,470
Malignant type of high pressure where pressure stays up, whatever you do, is more difficult than

106
00:23:54,570 --> 00:24:01,680
showing an effect on heart conditions. It would be very interesting for us if we could ever do this

107
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:07,880
experiment where people
are prepared for heart transplantation.

108
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:18,680
And they can give us the possibility to treat half of this group which is prepared for heart transplantation

109
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:29,390
and say what is your possibilities to live with transplantation? Ok, 3,4,5 years, ok let's see with Homeopathy.

110
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:37,040
I believe that Homeopathy could have better results than heart transplantation.

111
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:44,660
It can act even in progressed gross pathology of the heart.

112
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:58,890
I say that because I have seen unbeliavable things.

113
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:13,040
-George I had a question about the frequency and the dose in the cases of the asthma.

114
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:22,380
These are patients who are on cortisone or steroid drugs and you are recommending 200C potency

115
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:29,720
several times a day for a week. And at that time you expect to see some stability on the patient

116
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:37,160
after receiving the homeopathic treatment? And that's why you begin to wean off the cortisone?

117
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:45,360
-You see in these cases, you see first improvement and then you start reducing.

118
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:51,710
 If you don't see improvement, you don't reduce. If you see improvement then you start,

119
00:25:51,810 --> 00:26:01,950
 that means your remedy is correct and most probably you can reduce the cortisone.

120
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:12,300
-A question I have from the theoretical basis is,
 if you give that kind of repetitional 200C potency,

121
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,540
is it not possible to get an aggravation
 first before amelioration?

122
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:31,580
-Yes it is possible you may see but you continue through the aggravation, you continue.

123
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:36,960
-If the patient lets you.
-Yes.

124
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:07,680
With the epileptics this is a quite
 tempting situation for Homeopathy.

125
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:20,560
We have seen that children with epilepsy are responding quite well to Homeopathy.

126
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:28,780
Especially if they come before
starting the allopathic drugging.

127
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:41,350
I have seen cases where children have
received all kinds of allopathic druging

128
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:52,910
 there are several drugs which are given and sometimes they combine the two drugs together

129
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:59,550
 in order to have an effect on the children.
Still the children they go and have epileptic fits.

130
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:09,250
 In such cases where the allopathic drugging does not have a real effect it has a partial effect

131
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:19,300
then such cases are good to try Homeopathy. Again you will have to try repeating the potency.

132
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:32,530
Here in epileptics you can go up to high, even higher, up to 1M and you repeat 3-4 times per day

133
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:46,560
until you see some improvement and then you start cutting down; the improvement in such cases

134
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:56,000
you cannot see before a month. At least one month you will have to continue and then check it

135
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:03,470
 and then of course you have the possibility to check it with an electroencephalogram it's even better.

136
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:11,740
 Because if the encephalogram shows some improvement this is a very encouraging thing.

137
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:25,880
If it starts coming back after a few months, you may see the encephalogram becoming better and better.

138
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:51,050
-George just before I came to a case of a woman on 4th stage of breast cancer but she has not taken any chemo etc,

139
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:57,330
she just tries to go very natural with it.
What's happening now, I examined the breast

140
00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:07,030
 and she has mushroom-like growth coming out of the breast and from time to time the breast just bleeds.

141
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:22,510
And now with the chemo the bleeding has stopped but I wonder is this a case that can respond well to Homeopathy?

142
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:32,420
-If the chemotherapy has started it's better not to interfere during chemotherapy because most probably

143
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:36,540
you will be wasting your energy.

144
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:49,120
But after chemotherapy it is necessary to start homeopathic treatment if she has any chance.

145
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:57,620
Because there are two possibilities, if the type of cancer is the metastatic one, the one that makes fast metastasis

146
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:04,630
 forget Homeopathy, it can give a few months more from other therapies but that's all.

147
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:20,190
The fast metastasis is a lost case, forget it, nobody can do anything. But the other cases they can last very many years.

148
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:35,650
And even if they have operation or chemotherapy or both and afterwards they have homeopathic treatment, it's even better.

149
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:46,670
But it depends what type of cancer it is. I remember a case of a woman who had her brother, he was a doctor,

150
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:55,020
her father was a doctor and her other sister
 was a doctor and they examined her.

151
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:05,220
 One of these examined her and they found in the very beginning a little gland, immediately she was taken to Sweden

152
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:19,670
and she had radiotherapies and in 3 months she died.  And it was very early diagnosed.

153
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:37,330
The main thing is, especially in these 3 categories, you're going to have a lot of problems

154
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:42,090
if you stop suddenly the medication.

155
00:32:52,100 --> 00:33:23,120
Now there are other cases like Lupus erythematosus, Rheumatoid arthritis, Psoriasis

156
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:44,220
Diabetes, in all these cases if they're under cortisone, these cases may be under cortisone,

157
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:53,700
these cases maybe under hormones these maybe under interferon, these maybe under antiepileptics.

158
00:33:53,800 --> 00:34:10,380
In all these cases you can more easily decide to reduce the medication even before giving the remedy.

159
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:20,790
Reducing the medication in such cases will give you a better idea of the defense mechanism.

160
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:31,100
So it is better in such cases if you reduce first the medication for a period of time, let us say 15 days,

161
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:41,870
and then take the case again. Of course if you take the case and see the remedy is clear, then you can start immediately

162
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:53,880
and immediately you can start,
at the same time, reducing the drugs.

163
00:34:54,660 --> 00:35:09,940
In such cases there is no imminent danger. There is a danger of course of worsening.

164
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:37,860
Here also in these cases we should put ulcerative colitis under cortisone which is a very dangerous situation to take away.

165
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:53,380
You have to be sure about the remedy so the remedy can reduce the impact of the disease and then, as I said,

166
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:57,900
during crisis you may have to go
 back to cortisone like with asthma.

167
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:06,860
Back to cortisone, back to homeopathic treatment and it is quite a dangerous situation.

168
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:25,760
-I had a case also of ulcerative colitis a few months ago a patient came to see me from the other side of the country.

169
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:35,190
Before she came to see me she was hospitalised and put on cortisone and steroids and after leaving the hospital,

170
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:45,010
I took the case, put her on a remedy she did very well. Her blood level was very low, it went up for about two weeks.

171
00:36:45,110 --> 00:36:57,340
Frequency of stools and texture and consistency had improved and her blood levels went down again

172
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:05,790
but when she went to see her internist, her internist had doubts whether she had to put her back on cortisone and steroids

173
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:17,600
because she looked so healthy. She started engaging in sexual activity again, she felt a new feeling for her boyfriend,

174
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:26,070
she started writing a book for the first time in many years she is olympic athlete and so my question is

175
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:34,110
why would her well being seem being
 so strong, her blood levels go down?

176
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:45,740
- She starts having a relapse and the relapse starts with certain signs and symptoms and whether

177
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:51,100
you will be able to control the relapse with the same remedy or another remedy,

178
00:37:51,200 --> 00:38:01,210
 that is a question and how long she is going to remain well. This is a question depending on whether

179
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:10,950
the remedies you prescribe are correct or not.
But ulcerative colitis we have different degrees.

180
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:22,880
  There is pain and the stool is bloody but it's a difference between somebody who has five stools per day

181
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:29,990
and twenty stools per day. There is a big difference between these two people.

182
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:40,010
And you have to understand beforehand the severity of the case.

183
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:51,510
Especially you have to be more careful when these cases are from ulcerative colitis and they have also

184
00:38:51,610 --> 00:39:01,330
 mental-emotional symtomatology. Strong mental-emotional symptomatology will show up with the colitis eventually.

185
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:07,170
As the mental-emotional is getting better,
 the colitis will go crazy.

186
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:15,620
And you have to be aware. If the ulcerative colitis people you see them healthy, don't be afraid.

187
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:21,890
If you see disturbances on mental-emotional here, be very careful.

188
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:37,380
Because a lot of these people belong to hypochondriacs and the moment you try to treat them,

189
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:48,060
instead of reducing you see the increasing
 of the colitis. Then there is a big problem.
