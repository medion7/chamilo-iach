1
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,430
-For my understanding, there have been some discussions and misunderstandings in the group,

2
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:36,180
of how a proper follow up should be given. And I would like to ask you to clarify how a proper follow up should be like?

3
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,240
-Ok, I'll give you my idea of a proper follow up.

4
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:59,730
A proper follow up is one that gives first of all an overall impression of what is going on before and after the treatment.

5
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:02,800
It's an overall impression.

6
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:17,520
I'm better in this, this, this and I'm worse in this, this. I am the same, whatever is the general state first.

7
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:29,280
So we can get an impression of the subjective feelings of the patient. What are her subjective feelings?

8
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:45,360
And this has three parts. One is the mental-emotional part which is of very great importance and interest,

9
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:52,940
the second is the energy level and the
third is the local symptomatology.

10
00:01:53,040 --> 00:02:03,180
So in this order a proper follow up should be given; mentally-emotionally, I'm the same, I'm better.

11
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:24,290
Energy wise I'm better, I'm the same, I'm worse.
And local symptoms you can also say what it is there for sure.

12
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:36,020
 If you had a little pain in the ear at the day 17/11/98 it's not important.

13
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:46,140
Unless this pain is until today. From November
 I have a pain in my ear which stays here.

14
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:54,800
Otherwise the practitioner, the one who is going to take the case, you're going to take the case you're confused

15
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:04,190
 and you give much more importance to a symptom that does not have any importance.

16
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:10,120
And then you misguided and then
you give the wrong remedy.

17
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:18,250
A patient who does not give a report like this,
 he can misguide anybody even myself.

18
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:26,740
I can be misguided because I tend
 to believe even though I'm very careful

19
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:32,820
in observing, there are individuals who believe what they say.

20
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:42,270
So if they believe what they say, I also
 believe. If somebody is trying to trick me,

21
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:49,420
I understand it immediately and I don't say anything. I will not say you try to trick me

22
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:57,520
 but I will try with the same words of the patient to prove, later on, that this is what you're saying,

23
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:01,580
 this is what you're saying, these two
 don't go together, something like that.

24
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,690
Because it's not nice to tell
somebody you try to trick me.

25
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:18,600
The desire to trick you is that now I'm with
 the doctor, let me get the best benefit.

26
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:23,040
So I have also this, this and that. Can
you do something for this, this and that?

27
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:35,050
But this eagerness to cure certain ailments may lead you into a kind of a relapse of the whole case.

28
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:40,720
Because instead of waiting, I give you a remedy which is wrong because

29
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:53,970
 if I have to wait and I give a remedy, the remedy is wrong. We have to wait, you are in the process of curing

30
00:04:54,070 --> 00:05:05,300
and we have to wait, placebo, you give placebo yes. But if somebody does not give this overall impression

31
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:11,810
 of the progress of his case and the progress should go from above, downwards.

32
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:21,560
From Mental, Emotional, Physical. Here we have a lot of problems finally. We can have a lot of problems

33
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:29,300
but we may still have to wait with severe
 things which are happening here.

34
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:37,880
Especially we have to wait when this process is correct and here is not so severe the situation.

35
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:53,640
So imagine somebody comes there and he says, I had a pain in my neck and then I had a pain in my lobe of the ear

36
00:05:53,740 --> 00:06:06,220
 and then a little pain there and he gives you 1000 pains which are going all over, what are you going to think?

37
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:17,490
And he doesn't talk about the energy, about the mental-emotional; the patient does not understand

38
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:26,260
the process of cure and then you may have to ask the patient, wait a moment how do feel in mental-emotional?

39
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:37,480
That means your fears, your anxieties, your depression. If the patient has come originally for depression,

40
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:44,930
is going to complain with a lot of physical symptoms, if your treatment is correct.

41
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:55,000
This is the most successful treatment; otherwise your treatment was not correct. It was a placebo effect,

42
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:02,980
I feel a bit better and then back again etc. etc.
 It has to come down here. And when it comes down there,

43
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:09,230
there are complains. But these complains you have to decide, is the remedy clear, yes or no?

44
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:20,720
If it's clear ok, I'll give you a remedy. If it's not clear, but I feel pain, say 'it is not clear I can't give you a remedy'.

45
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:29,220
This is how strict you may be. Oh I go
 to acupunture. Go to acupuncture.

46
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:35,490
I go to chiropractors. Go to chiropractors.
 I don't care what are you doing.

47
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:44,150
What I care is what I know is correct and
you must do. You must sit there and wait.

48
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,890
That is for me the correct thing to do at this moment.

49
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:57,720
There is no way that you have a big depression here and you won't get a spasm over there.

50
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:04,740
So it is to the detriment of the patient if
he does not give you the right information.

51
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:16,640
You try to trick me is like tricking your own self. What is this? That is why the best follow-ups come from simple people,

52
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:28,650
 not intellectuals. Simple people say, yes this is better and now I have this. You say, my God the case is clear

53
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:44,650
because there is a kind of clarity and purity in these levels but we have learned 'if I tell him that I have this, this and that,

54
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:53,220
he will try harder, he will give me a better remedy and then I will be cured'. Forget it, there is no such thing.

55
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:05,000
You just say the truth what is there and then
let the Homeopath who knows what is doing.

56
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,760
The problem is how many Homeopaths all
 over the world know what they are doing?

57
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:15,670
Perhaps you are the only group because you listen to this theory.

58
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:24,160
All the other Homeopaths all over the world, they just throw remedies. Throw this remedy, throw this remedy.

59
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:35,910
I can prescribe remedies in 5 minutes but you will be missing all the essence, all the information.

60
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:48,420
You see, real cure is a magical thing. Something which is beyond our ability to handle it.

61
00:09:48,520 --> 00:10:04,420
You say, I will cure you. Who are you? I know Homeopathy. You see the most clear case and you fail.

62
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:15,890
And you think it's clear and you fail. I say ok now what? Watch yourself, go to the mirror look at yourself and say,

63
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:37,430
I will cure you. Wait a moment. Homeopathy is a discovery. You discover this magic, this individual reaction of each person.

64
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,730
 You observe and you discover. Sometimes
 it's a very tedious process.

65
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:51,540
If you want to learn Homeopathy
you put a lot of effort. This is no question.

66
00:10:51,640 --> 00:11:01,630
A lot of effort in studying, in watching, in observing, in waiting, you put a lot of effort.

67
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:07,140
You can't say, I'm bored with this case.
This case you're going to discover.

68
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:16,370
You wait until that magical moment when you discover that which makes the case clear, there is a magical moment.

69
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:32,740
And if you do this process, then you are going to discover a treasure of symptomatology.

70
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:48,740
You will discover that Sepia has multifacets. This can be Sepia, that can be Sepia. Ignatia, the Calcarea carbonica.

71
00:11:50,350 --> 00:12:07,660
I told you many times students of mine, oh why did you prescribe that remedy? Because I have listened to many Pulsatilla cases

72
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:16,660
and I have seen that Pulsatilla is not only the
one who is easily lead and easily persuaded.

73
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:27,180
It's not only that, it's something else as well. When did I discover it? When I listen to the case.

74
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:36,180
Yes, if I dont' want to listen of course. If you are
 a very busy practicioner you don't listen. If you become too soon,

75
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:46,510
 too famous, people will start coming one after another. Now you are greedy either to get more money

76
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:54,250
or to get more fame and then you prescribe. These things I have done, I know the psychology,

77
00:12:54,350 --> 00:13:01,010
I know everything which is going on. 40 years I'm observing myself and I'm observing the patients.

78
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:13,870
What I'm telling you is not stories from another planet. They are stories from real experience.

79
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:31,620
But in the back of my mind was, George you are missing a lot. In one hour I had scheduled five cases.

80
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:44,790
And I will see the case is better.
I am much better, ok, placebo, next.

81
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:53,020
So I gain a few minutes from the next case that was a new case and maybe I had a problem.

82
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,850
 And sometimes I was stuck of course and instead of finishing at 9-10 o'clock in the night,

83
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:02,880
 I would finish at 1 o'oclock in the morning.

84
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:18,320
So this discovery, this new attitude and
I know where can I get a new attitude.

85
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:35,090
 You have a typical case of Nat-m, worse sun, aversion to fat and desires salt and has headaches.

86
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:48,220
 Ah, Nat-m, go. If you do this, you missed a lot of the inner complexes of this person because you see

87
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:54,780
a typical case of Nat-m and you don't investigate. You just give the remedy and you let it go.

88
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:04,190
Here, you have a treasure in front of you and you let it go because now you're going to discover the new symptoms

89
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:13,940
which belong to that particular individual. And then you discover that Nat-m has also this and that,

90
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:24,420
that fear, that anxiety etc. etc. That is the time when you sit and investigate and you listen.

91
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:29,710
 The Nat-m can become very hypochondiacal.

92
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:39,860
Talk, talk, talk how do you know this? Because you have listened some time, one time or another.

93
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:48,950
You didn't listen one time in order to say Nat-m is hypochondriacal that means you listened to 10 cases

94
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:56,940
 which are hypochondriacal. And they bother
 you with little symptoms here and here.

95
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:14,380
You think is it Nitric acid? Hypochondriacal anxiety, Kali-ars is not an anxiety, it's fear. I'm going to die.

96
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:29,620
Nat-m is hypochondriac.
This, this, this, that... placebo. Why?

97
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:36,620
 Because before she was in depression, now she has this little, this, that, placebo.

98
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:48,870
But you listen and you discover oh, there is a hypochondriasis, still belongs to Nat-m. Wait, placebo.

99
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:54,560
And then it comes a kind of a balance eventually.

100
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:17,560
What I planned to talk to you today is miasms.

101
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:52,400
Definition. When we say miasm, what do
we really mean? We have this word to specify something I think,

102
00:17:54,280 --> 00:18:02,680
something misunderstood in each
one of us. What is a miasm?

103
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:22,520
We can say that a miasm is this energic
complex net. It's a net, like this.

104
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:39,590
This is one miasm. Then put on top of it another miasm, you just twist a bit and you put a complex net.

105
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:52,560
And put another complex net, you twist a bit and you will see almost, all the holes are closed.

106
00:18:55,930 --> 00:19:04,060
When all the holes are closed, that means 5 miasms, then we say the case is incurable. Why?

107
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:13,440
Because there is no energy that goes through those holes. The energy produces symptomatology.

108
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:28,360
You close the energy totally and then you have
 a state of total "adynamia", total weakness.

109
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:45,750
No symptomatology, no indications. The organism is totally blocked as far as energy is concerned

110
00:19:45,850 --> 00:20:02,320
 and is going to go down and die. And this
cannot be found in any physical system,

111
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:13,620
it's not on the lymphatic, is not on the nervous, is not on the reticuloendotheliac, is not something which you will find

112
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:26,090
its physical counterpart in the different systems of the body. A net like this may have affected one, two or three

113
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:43,240
 or all the systems of the body. This network, this complex network that blocks the defensive energy of the body,

114
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:56,470
because we're talking mostly about energy condition, can be taken away with 1, 2 or 3 remedies.

115
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:10,550
You can take away what we call a miasm not only with one remedy; you may need 3 different remedies to take out,

116
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:21,120
what we call a syphilitic miasm or a sycotic miasm or a tubercular miasm.

117
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:40,030
You see this is another net, you see how it closes. And this is another net and you have this, a very unfortunate situation

118
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:52,480
 in which if you put these nets in another perspective,

119
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:05,450
this is what you're looking for,
 for the first miasm, these 3 keynotes.

120
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:22,040
To take away the first miasm, the first layer. Layer and miasms are similar ideas. The only difference is that

121
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:29,440
a miasm may need in order to take
 away, 3 layers, 3 remedies.

122
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:34,540
So an individual who needs 3
 remedies for the first layer,

123
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:40,890
 3 remedies for the second, 3 remedies for the third, is a very difficult case to treat.

124
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:56,760
Now what are the qualities of this complex net.
We have some parameters to define the miasm.

125
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:07,510
First parameter is when can we call a symptom complex, when can we call it a miasm?

126
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:12,610
When it has at first, origin.

127
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:38,600
It has a specific origin and this may be bacteria, microbes, virus etc., chemical substances.

128
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:56,910
Because we're using very complex chemical substances today, we can create a miasmatic blockage in the organisms.

129
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:10,190
And these is one of the most dangerous things we're doing to ourselves today, concerning the overuse of chemical drugs.

130
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:30,200
So it has a specific origin and
b) it can produce a specific set of symptoms.

131
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:46,830
Now if you take these two factors, you put all the infectious diseases here. What is the third factor that you need to have

132
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:58,860
in order to call it a miasm, not every
acute disease can produce a miasm.

133
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:10,690
You need a third factor in order to have the
 idea of a miasm. Which is this third factor?

134
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:26,460
-The family history? Hereditary?

135
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:37,470
-Genetic disposition I think.

136
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:49,460
-Genetic disposition, yes but all these have an effect. The genetic disposition etc. What is the effect?

137
00:25:49,560 --> 00:26:00,040
The effect is that they have the ability, the miasm has the ability to pass from one generation to another.

138
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:17,260
It has the quality, the capacity to transfer
 its network into the next generation.

139
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:26,870
This is a condition, absolutely
necessary that we have a miasm.

140
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:39,820
So passing this to the next generation.

141
00:26:53,820 --> 00:27:09,140
If we accept this kind of definition and this kind of conditions for a miasm, then we may say that we have more than 3 miasms.

142
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:23,860
Hahnemann had an idea and the idea was correct. What was his idea? Something was blocking the case.

143
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:33,060
 He would say, I will give Rhus tox to somebody and he will come back again and again with symptoms of Rhus tox.

144
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:43,210
 During that time the organisms were strong enough, so they had very orderly symptomatology.

145
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:55,660
So the patient will come back with Rhus tox. And then when I gave a Calcarea carbonica to such a case, the person was cured.

146
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:06,140
What does that mean? He, therefore thought, I gave a deeper remedy to counteract a miasm.

147
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:20,910
That was an original idea, like a raw idea which comes first. This idea has to be thought out, put into practice, observed etc.

148
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:38,680
and eventually you have the real truth revealed. Like in the beginning, I said, the conception can take place in phase one

149
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:50,100
when the organism is totally in a state of satisfaction and equillibruim. That's a raw idea.

150
00:28:50,690 --> 00:29:03,100
Now if this idea is going to be put into practice, some gynecologists who are dealing with in vitro fertilization etc.,

151
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:17,180
they will try to find the parameters how to recognize these living cells which are in phase 1.

152
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:23,500
 And if they can recognize it in the microscope, they take this, this is good and fertilisation

153
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:39,580
instead of being successful 10-15 %, will be 85 %. This is a raw idea which may have or may have not validity.

154
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:43,810
 It will have a validity after it has been put into practice.

155
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:50,060
In the same way, Hahnemann's
idea of the miasm was a raw idea.

156
00:29:50,160 --> 00:30:03,390
Now some contemporary Homeopaths took this idea and made a kind of dogmatism out of it.

157
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:13,910
The idea is this. It's not dogmatic idea. We have 3 miasms and then how do you explain the fact that

158
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:23,150
when you have Tuberculosis in the family, you give Tuberculinum to the patient and the patient is cured. How is he cured?

159
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:31,890
Oh, Tuberculosis is a mixture of 2 miasms. Or something like that. What is this? That has nohing to do?

160
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:39,590
If it's a mixture of 2 miasms, Syphilis and Sycosis, that means you need sycotic drugs, you need syphilitic drugs

161
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:52,820
 before you can solve a case of Tuberculosis or of tubercular origin. But what practice shows is,

162
00:30:52,920 --> 00:31:02,140
 when you give Tuberculinum this miasm is going away. All the tubercular miasm is disappearing.

163
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:16,610
And further than that it was a misunderstanding that we could find the remedy of a person

164
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:26,590
 because we understood the miasms. This is totally wrong. If somebody tells you,

165
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:43,380
 'I found between Merc. and Nat-s., I choose Merc. because I saw the syphilitic miasm in this case'.

166
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:52,320
There is an english word but it's not to be
said in front of ladies; I would use that word.

167
00:31:52,420 --> 00:32:14,380
Because actually what you do in a case of Syphilis where you use Medorrhinum. What is this now?

168
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:22,040
You say the Syphilis has produced sycotic or the sycotic symptoms of Medorrhinum are syphilitic.

169
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:35,030
All kinds of twisting thinking is going on in order to justify certain things which are not explained and not justified.

170
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:45,890
Therefore this idea I will know the remedy,
 if I know the miasm, is a wrong conception.

171
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:57,220
That came originally not from Hahnemann but from followers who misunderstood the theory of Hahnemann.

172
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:06,820
And why Hahnemann was stating all these things. Hahnemann was correct when he said,  there is a blockage

173
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:14,690
because this net of the miasm is an
obstacle, is a blockage that has to go out.

174
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:21,980
And it goes out with what? With the correct remedy, maybe two remedies.

175
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:42,240
This is the one thing. The other is: do we have
 a specific set of symptoms for each miasm?

176
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:54,900
And we say, we have to have this. So therefore if I know the specific set of symptoms, is it more easy for me to find the remedy?

177
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:21,480
Let's go from experience and see
what is the psoric miasm.

178
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:38,060
And the psoric miasm as the word says,
is a miasm that comes from skin eruptions,

179
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:52,000
 from suppressed skin eruptions producing what?
Producing inner states similar to the itching.

180
00:34:55,990 --> 00:35:07,530
 You will be surprised for instance to see in some cases that a skin eruption that is very itchy,

181
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:19,880
produces a state of restlessness and anxiety which never leaves you in peace.

182
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:34,330
It produces a similar inner state. Have you been really ever having a skin eruption that is itching?

183
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:43,230
You will see that you go to sleep and then you start scratching and scratching and you turn and you turn and you turn.

184
00:35:46,170 --> 00:36:03,900
And that is an anxiety state or a restlessness state which is, in the same way that you need to scratch,

185
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:15,140
you need to scratch your brain. Or if it's going into the lungs this itching, then there is constant irritation

186
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:31,380
of the lungs all the time. But ok, you say you have the psoric miasm. What is the remedy?

187
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:36,150
Does this help you to see the remedy?

188
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:57,300
Very few cases are clear cases where you will say, now I treated this case with syphilitic remedies,

189
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:06,770
she started with Aurum, went to Mercury, took Syphilinum etc. and now is coming with symptoms of psora.

190
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:13,450
This itching, this restlessness, this anxiety has developed. Very few cases.

191
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:25,440
And you will see from the cases we treat how much more complicated are things, even with cases which are clear cases.

192
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:44,740
Let's take the case where we prescribed Ignatia 50M and then it came to Sulphur clear and then Calcarea carbonica clear.

193
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:53,360
 What is this miasm?

194
00:37:56,010 --> 00:38:04,560
Ignatia you have
 to say belongs to what miasm?

195
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:14,460
 And then because of this problem, those who brought up these theories for those who are interested,

196
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:22,480
 they said Ignatia oh, Ignatia is syphilitic,
 is sycotic and is psoric.

197
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:40,660
Sulphur, what is Sulphur? Oh Sulphur is primarily psoric, primarily syphilitic and primarily sycotic. What is really going on?

198
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:49,960
I had a student of Ortega here in Alonissos
and I presented a case of Medorrhinum.

199
00:38:50,060 --> 00:39:06,390
A Medorrhinum which is very introverted, it cannot talk at all. It will not communicate, it's totally antisocial.

200
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:19,380
The words cannot come out. They cannot
stay with a group of people unless they drink.

201
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:26,300
If they are drunk they can communicate,
 they can go out of the house etc.

202
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:37,780
I presented this case and she was down in the class and I said, what is this case? You tell me.

203
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:52,620
She was the best student of Ortega. She had in her mind this prejudice. She said, this case is a clear case of Calcarea carbonica.

204
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:59,860
I asked the other students. Some of them said this is a case of Medorrhinum because it's better in the sea

205
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:09,150
and desires unripe fruits and things like that
and because they were some other indications.

206
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:19,970
She said, it's a clear case but the remedy which cured this case was Medorrhinum unfortunately.

207
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:28,540
It doesn't matter what your ideas are and
your preconceptions or even prejudice.

208
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:37,520
Because if you have some prejudices you are going to have a problem with Homeopathy.

209
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:47,460
If you can become somebody who does not know anything when you see a case, my God I don't know anything.

210
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:53,940
If you have that state of feeling that I dont' know anything, then everything that the patient says

211
00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:06,220
will be impressed upon you and then the anamnesis from what you know, eventually will come.

212
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:20,190
If you go with the idea that I know this, I know the miasms, immediately you cut down the possibility of information to flow in.

213
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:28,960
You have a preconceived idea.
Forget about finding the remedy.

214
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:37,280
You have to be like a blackboard on which nothing is written and the patient is going to write the symptoms.

215
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:46,130
And you receive all the symptoms and then you make an analysis and then you make a synthesis.

216
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:53,940
 In the same way, the idea of the miasm
a lot of misconceptions have taken place.

217
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:17,510
The itch has a similar inner state. The
Syphilis also has an analogous inner state.

218
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:34,730
From conventional Medicine you know the stages of Syphilis, if they go in they can affect of course the vascular system,

219
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:42,280
 it can affect the nervous system and it can affect the skin. So there are certain stages which you know.

220
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:57,070
 Syphilis will follow. But what is the mental-emotional state of the syphilitic patient we don't know.

221
00:42:57,170 --> 00:43:06,020
The only thing we know when it has affected the nervous system and then in the end of the nervous system

222
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:16,340
you see a distraction of the mental faculties, after you have seen the Tabes dorsalis, the paralysis on the nervous system,

223
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:24,780
then eventually you will see the distraction of the central nervous system as well. But before that,

224
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:37,910
 there are some distractions that have been done on a subtle level with Syphilis which are interesting to study.

225
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:48,940
For instance if we had the possibility, that the Universities had students working in different subjects,

226
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:59,000
and we had a hospital, I could give them research projects that we could find fantastic things and to put in order

227
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:05,520
again back in order what is today a confusion in Medicine.

228
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:25,680
Then Syphilis is creating a state in the organism which is self-destructive and in order to prevent that self-destruction

229
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:34,280
because it is an organism that goes
 into the body and wants to kill everything.

230
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:49,020
You intervene in that process and you save the patient, but the idea is to destruct and to distort and to kill.

231
00:44:49,120 --> 00:45:00,420
So the organism in order not to die finds ways out. And what we see is perversions in thinking,

232
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:06,150
perversions in feelings, perversions in sex.

233
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:22,540
So a lot of perverted sexual practices which are happening in certain nations, I would say,

234
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:42,630
who they were under the effect of Syphilis, are due to great exposure to primary syphilitic infection.

235
00:45:45,490 --> 00:46:04,140
Alcoholism, the use of drugs, when I say drugs
 I mean the narcotics, is a syphilitic perversion

236
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:17,300
but these perversions in sexual issues
they take a lot of distorted expressions.

237
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:40,230
And depending on how strong the syphilitic tendency is there in the body, so bigger is going to be the self-destruction.

238
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:45,820
Why do we say Aurum is a syphilitic remedy?

239
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:56,830
Because it has this idea of self-destruction very strongly. In the same way Platina is syphilitic.

240
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:11,830
These are remedies which have all kinds of perversions and self-destruction.

241
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:26,290
So as an idea we may say Syphilis has self-destruction and perversions. And this is a theme, a general theme.

242
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:42,310
And it comes from the actual facts of this infection. Now if you go to sycosis, you have different facts.

243
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:54,770
In Gonorrhea for instance, which we're mostly talking about, we see as the immediate reaction

244
00:47:54,870 --> 00:48:03,540
of suppressed Gonorrhea, we see condylomata.
That means the organism under Gonorrhea

245
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:23,250
 infection has the tendency to bring out an eruption, a hard tumor.

246
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:39,790
It's like a volcano. It cannot retain it. It has to come out to the surface. That's the idea.

247
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:56,340
But when you see self-destruction tendencies together with condylomata, which is going to go first?

248
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:05,070
What determines what is going to go first are the symptoms. What are the main uppermost symptoms,

249
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:11,320
keynote symptoms on which you're
going to base your prescription?

250
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:19,720
If you don't know the theory of miasms at all, if you don't understand anything, still you can be a very good Homeopath.

251
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:32,600
If you understand the theory and you know the theory, it will make you a better philosopher but not a better healer.

252
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:47,460
You see your enthusiasm when I say, I' m going to talk about miasms, why? Because in your mind you had the idea

253
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:55,920
that if we know the miasms then we can
more easily find the remedies. Forget it.

254
00:49:56,450 --> 00:50:02,900
I can tell you it can misguide you and you can give the wrong medicine. I have seen it again and again.

255
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,150
I say why did you give this remedy?
It's a syphilitic case so I thought of Mercury.

256
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:14,300
 I said, Mercury did something? No. Ok, give Medorrhinum, see what happens with Medorrhinum.

257
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:37,380
We have an explosive character, we have an expressive character in Sycosis, that is true but they say, for instance,

258
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:47,010
Natrum sulphuricum, what is this remedy?
Sycotic, syphilitic or psoric?

259
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:50,880
-Sycotic.
-Mostly sycotic. They say, mostly sycotic.

260
00:50:51,920 --> 00:51:03,870
Ok, take a Nat-s patient with an asthma case and try to show me where is this explosive general attitude, expressive.

261
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:20,180
It's not expressive, it's a remedy which is very composed in the mental-emotional, very unexpressive I would say,

262
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:36,530
but you need Nat-s, why? Because of the 4am aggravation. If you think that this is a case of Syphilis,

263
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:49,520
 you will never give a Nat-s but you see the 4 o'clock aggravation etc. No, no it's a syphilitic case and will give

264
00:51:49,620 --> 00:52:08,610
Syphilinum or will give Mercury. Again you go to tubercular miasm. It has a kind of overall picture.

265
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:17,510
 What it this overall picture? First of all cachexia, it doesn't allow the person to develop properly.

266
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:28,070
Secondly you see easy infections,
especially of the respiratory tract.

267
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:42,180
Repeated infections of the respiratory tract together with a kind of cachexia, it has to give you the idea of Tuberculinum.

268
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:49,020
But in Tuberculinum you have to have the grinding of the teeth, the desire for fat, desire for pork etc.

269
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:56,820
Little things like that which will give you the clue.

270
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:13,580
What is the general idea of cancer, of cancerous miasm because you have found out many times when a person says,

271
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:22,000
my mother died, my father died, my uncles died from cancer, you give Cancerinum and many times

272
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:31,580
they will say that this was an excellent remedy for me. That means it took away a complex net

273
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:39,750
 that was blocking the case due
to this hereditary predisposition

274
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:49,970
and then you find out more or less
what was taking out from this case,

275
00:53:50,070 --> 00:54:00,920
 what was the general indications and then that's how we came to know the symptomatology of Cancerinum.

276
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:12,420
And this is how we found out that Cancerinum has both types of people. One who is suppressed but nice

277
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:27,480
and the other which is angry and loose and just doesn't care who is going to kill around.

278
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:40,890
There are these two types of persons in Cancerinum. The one that is like a "bulldozer" they will go around the house,

279
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:49,940
their own environment, children they don't care, they don't care about parents, if they hurt them, if they don't hurt them.

280
00:54:51,560 --> 00:55:01,080
'Just give me money, you are my mother you have to give me money. You are a bad mother'.

281
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:21,770
And then the mother says, 'ok take money'. 'Buy me a motorbike. I can't go to school walking, it's half an hour'.

282
00:55:21,870 --> 00:55:28,510
He sleeps up to 10 o'clock, wake up, leave
me alone, wake up you have to go to school.

283
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:39,970
The mother says, 'I'm afraid because he will hit me'. That type can be a Cancerinum type, this explosive.

284
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:57,560
This is where we have the final stages where it destroys everything; the cancer destroys the body totally in a very short time.

285
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:15,060
-So you are saying it's not influencing your praxis and you never mention miasms anyway. But Hahnemann says that

286
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:23,420
when the best chosen remedy is not working with the patient, he was looking for the possible miasm,

287
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:30,190
 Tuberculosis in the family which he treated with a kind of priority and gave a remedy for that. If there was Syphilis

288
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:37,100
 in the family, he gave a syphilitic remedy,
so you didn't find anything like that?

289
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:54,510
-No. There is no such thing. You may do it and still you may be effective sometimes but there are no rules

290
00:56:54,610 --> 00:57:01,780
on which you can base a prescription
concerning the knowledge of a miasm. There are no rules.

291
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:16,220
If you say at a certain moment, let me give some nosodes and some people do it as a regular practice, they give

292
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:28,430
Medorrhinum, Syphilinum Tuberculinum, they give Psorinum in the beginning of their treatment.

293
00:57:28,530 --> 00:57:36,340
And they claim to have some effect. Of course, these people who need one of these nosodes will be affected.

294
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:47,410
What about the others? They have
 taken deep nosodes for no reason.

295
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:56,060
-But you have a case which has had Tuberculosis before and has 1-2 keynotes of Tuberculosis.

296
00:57:56,160 --> 00:58:09,980
-Yes, if you have 1-2. But let us say, you have a case which had Tuberculosis and you see a case clear Calcarea carbonica.

297
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:14,440
What are you going to give?
Tuberculinum or Calcarea carbonica?

298
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:25,580
Actually one of my students in Athens when she came first, she came with Tuberculosis and still was there.

299
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:31,940
You could see in the X-ray.
 It was a case of Calcarea carbonica.

300
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:36,780
I gave her Calcarea carbonica and the whole thing disappeared. It cleared up and the whole organism

301
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:42,450
 started developing again in 2-3 months. If I had this idea? Another case I remember of Syphilis.

302
00:58:49,550 --> 00:59:05,170
 Syphilis that was positive after years of treatment with penicillin, still was positive after the test.

303
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:19,020
And this was a case of Calcarea carbonica. I gave her Calcarea carbonica and the test became negative

304
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:26,120
and the woman felt much better.
Now if I had this idea of Syphilinum, why?

305
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:32,500
But from the very beginning I mistrusted because when I saw her, I did this one time, two times.

306
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:38,820
You have to observe, it doesn't work. Then something else happens and what is this something else?

307
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:50,780
It is these things here, the 3 keynotes. If you have 3 keynotes of Tuberculinum, you give Tuberculinum, there is no question.

308
00:59:50,880 --> 01:00:07,270
With tuberculous idea plus 1,2,3 keynotes, you give Tuberculinum. On the other hand if you do have more symptoms of Sulphur,

309
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:12,350
 you have to give Sulphur, nevermind what you know about the family.

310
01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:19,010
I know that my father had Syphilis; it does
 not matter, still Sulphur will be indicated?

311
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:32,010
Calcarea carbonica will be indicated? You give it.
I try to take you out of the frame of mind which is set on certain things.

312
01:00:36,730 --> 01:00:42,990
Why do you think I do not give you indications
 of what to do in different pathological cases?

313
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:45,680
Do you think I don't know?

314
01:00:53,070 --> 01:01:00,970
I know very well and I know that if I put together 5 remedies I can make a specific composition

315
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:06,900
that will affect most of the individuals
that have that particular pathology.

316
01:01:08,810 --> 01:01:18,190
But if I do that I will become very rich I can assure you because all over the world they'd be selling

317
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:31,480
these GV composite for rheumatic, whatever and then I would be very rich but I would have destroyed Homeopathy,

318
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:43,800
the possibility to really cure, to really regenerate a generation which is going down the gutter and there is no hope.

319
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:49,160
It's going to be degenerated more and
more. And if I do that what they will do?

320
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:56,740
They will go to the pharmacy and say, give me this rheumatic or give me this rhinitic or give me this headache pill

321
01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:05,800
and they will feel better and they can go on.
But this better needs the second remedy and needs the third remedy

322
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:15,540
 and when is the time for the second
or the third and what follows the first remedy?

323
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:23,570
And why after the first remedy it has to go to Sulphur, there are reasons. And I'm teaching you that and I don't

324
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:34,470
want to teach you easy ways. If you want easy ways you just sit in a chair and you meditate

325
01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:46,080
what is your problem my dear child? My eyes are running and bla, bla, bla. I don't need anything else.

326
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:56,430
Take Euphrasia, Clematis, Graphites and Sulphur. And you become a guru.

327
01:02:57,810 --> 01:03:23,840
I mean when I was in Pakistan, I met the doctor of the President of Democracy. He was his personal and I said,

328
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:33,080
can I sit with you to see your practice? Of course sit there. He was chewing some kind of red stuff, you know.

329
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:44,900
The patient would come, I could not understand of course but I could hear 2-5 words and then I could see him writing

330
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:55,580
 a kind of prescription with 5-6 remedies. Take these remedies, you go there, he has his own pharmacy.

331
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:15,260
I said, 'very impressive. Do you have success'? 'Absolutely. He says, what are you doing?'

332
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:26,450
I said, 'maybe I've taken much more time. But you see so many people, how can you spend so much time?'

333
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:42,190
 And I explained to him a little bit,
 very carefully, so not to insult him.

334
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:54,660
Because he was my host and when
he is your host you are a little bit polite.

335
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:09,160
In the end he said to me, how much money you're earning with this practice? I told him something.

336
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:14,520
He says, I earn 20 times more than you.

337
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:23,090
I said, good luck. I don't know what's happening to him today but he was much younger than me.

338
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:32,500
But the idea is that you can do that with Homeopathy. Is this the correct way?

339
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:42,250
And why you are here? You are here only for that reason to see another aspect, another idea and I must show you this idea,

340
01:05:42,350 --> 01:05:48,270
I must show you this aspect. My idea is not to give you easy solutions.

341
01:05:48,370 --> 01:06:00,080
My idea is to give you the difficult and the difficulties and then the reward will come.

342
01:06:02,530 --> 01:06:09,760
Because people will understand
eventually who is good and who is bad.

343
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:23,480
-The heritage, the inheritance, these nets are becoming more and more tight for our children, right?

344
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:39,960
Is it possible through correct treatment and through lifting one miasmatic layer after the other to make it possible

345
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:44,200
for our children and future children
to become more and more healthy?

346
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:54,040
And would it be possible in the end even to eradicate all these nets and miasmatic difficulties and if it is possible,

347
01:06:54,140 --> 01:07:00,070
 is it possible within one generation or how
many generations do you think it will need?

348
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:15,630
- A lot of difficult questions but I can give you my impression. It's not the truth but my impression is that yes there is a possibility

349
01:07:15,730 --> 01:07:30,140
of taking away the miasms; to what extend I'm not sure. Yes there is a possibility of regenerating the race.

350
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:41,820
That means instead of your children being born in that state, if you take good Homeopathy for 3 years before,

351
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:54,580
your children will definitely be born better. But how many generations may take, it may take 3,4,5 I cannot say.

352
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:13,380
What I want to tell is this: let us say that somebody is using heroin which is the strongest of the recreational drugs.

353
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:22,250
And this person at a certain moment decides
to give up and become what they call, clean.

354
01:08:22,350 --> 01:08:37,270
And he goes to a detoxifying community or whatever. He doesn't do Homeopathy and then he marries

355
01:08:37,370 --> 01:08:55,930
 and that person has a child. Is his child going to be affected by the heroine miasm, yes or no? Who says yes?

356
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:07,430
Who says no. Nobody.

357
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:22,660
I'll tell you my experience that each organism
 has a kind of resistance to any chemicals.

358
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:34,440
Whatever chemical you give to my organism, it has a kind of resistance. So I resist, therefore when I say I resist,

359
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:51,760
I eliminate and no effect until such time when my resistance breaks at a certain point and my symptomatology

360
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:59,830
 starts changing. Once this has
happened, there is a possibility

361
01:09:59,930 --> 01:10:04,770
 of a miasm which is going to be
 transferred to the next generation.

362
01:10:04,870 --> 01:10:19,920
That means the effect of the drug has been written upon my DNA. There is a DNA effect, further than that

363
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:37,010
with this particular drug. This particular drug
will create a miasm for my offsprings.

364
01:10:53,330 --> 01:11:03,960
"progeny" that was the word I was trying to find. So therefore a person who has taken heroin

365
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:16,780
or has taken penicillin or whatever drug it doesn't necessarily mean that he has created a state of miasm.

366
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:22,370
The state of miasm is created once this
broken down situation has happened.

367
01:11:22,470 --> 01:11:41,030
You know the people who have taken marihuana, they may develop a state of a miasm with a little bit of marihuana, when?

368
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:52,360
When you will see this person is going to a state of anxiety after that, they lose totally their inner quietness,

369
01:11:52,460 --> 01:12:00,700
 they go into a state of anxiety and fears,
 esp. fear that they're going crazy.

370
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:08,190
Once they're in that state of anxiety
 and fears and they have children, forget it.

371
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:13,660
Their children will be born with anxiety and fears.

372
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:23,680
But if you treat them homeopathically you can spare the children from these anxieties.

373
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:36,820
-George if I can come back to the story of the miasm, we study miasm to understand the different level,

374
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:46,590
to understand the process of cure but what is essential is always to come back to the symptomatology

375
01:12:46,690 --> 01:12:52,350
 and to prescribe according to how clear is the picture and how many keynotes and

376
01:12:52,450 --> 01:12:57,040
how much confirmation we have
 on prescribing the remedy.

377
01:12:57,140 --> 01:13:04,680
-Is it correct?
-That's correct. Of course there are a lot of things to be discussed

378
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:16,820
and we can spend hours and hours to discuss in detail and there is also a possibility for reasearch in these matters

379
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:26,100
which can clarify for us much more issues but at this moment from a practical point of view what we need to know

380
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:36,040
is that we're dealing with that situation, that's the first one. We're dealing with a case of complex miasmatic conditions.

381
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:53,190
The second is to know that the elimination of such nets is done due to the correct uppermost remedy.

382
01:13:53,290 --> 01:14:07,440
It's not possible to say, this person needs Calc, let's give him from the beginning Calc. No.

383
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:17,750
-Can you explain again the difference
between the miasm and the layers?

384
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:35,340
-Ok, this is a miasm.
What is a layer on the miasm?

385
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:50,680
This is a layer on a miasm and
this layer we call it Arsenicum

386
01:14:51,490 --> 01:15:01,800
and once the Arsenicum is gone there
is this layer which is called Sulphur.

387
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:11,440
And perhaps even a third remedy.
And this miasm is lifted.

388
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:31,410
Let's go back to the case of A. with Pituitary gland extract that we gave. Which is the miasm?

389
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:37,920
You believe that by taking different
 remedies you have the same effect, no.

390
01:15:38,020 --> 01:15:52,540
You have to find the uppermost layer, nevermind what you call it. What is the miasm that was created under the vaccination,

391
01:15:52,640 --> 01:16:01,620
 let us say chicken pox or the triple vaccination etc. One organism is producing a state of Cuprum,

392
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:14,720
 the other organism is producing a state of Stamonium, the other first Stam. then Pitu-gl. then Bar-c...

393
01:16:20,170 --> 01:16:36,020
-What is your opinion about using the pills so frequent now and cortisone. I pay attention that the children

394
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:49,940
who received cortisone because of asthma came to school with restlessness, with hyperactivity.

395
01:16:50,040 --> 01:17:00,780
And then they received Ritalin and this is
very complicated case for me to treat it.

396
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:10,290
-Exactly. This is the idea. I mean you take some chemicals in the body...they found out

397
01:17:10,390 --> 01:17:15,640
 ah, you want to have safe sex, you take the pill.

398
01:17:16,110 --> 01:17:22,350
-Not only chemical. It is hormone. It is something very active for the organism.

399
01:17:22,450 --> 01:17:30,860
-That is what I say. Hormones are deep chemicals which affect the organism tremendously.

400
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:41,700
It's not lightly that you advice a young girl,
 just take the pill so you just have safe sex.

401
01:17:43,010 --> 01:17:51,760
Because there are other ways to have safe sex after all. There are the condoms and there is no harm for anybody.

402
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:56,760
Why should the woman go into that state?

403
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:10,300
And then have children which are
born with cancer? Sterility?

404
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:22,890
This is the state which the whole of planet is going at the moment because we need easy solutions

405
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:25,640
 and I'm not going to give you easy solutions.
