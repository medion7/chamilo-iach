1
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:39,860
We're going to talk about acute prescribing during chronic treatment.

2
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:47,800
I'm going to give you today something
which I have never taught so far.

3
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:52,540
 I'm going to give you my
experience of all these years.

4
00:00:53,050 --> 00:01:03,820
On this subject I have talked about,
20 years ago and I gave general

5
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:11,100
lines but as the years went by,
I have made different observations

6
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:23,180
and I came down to exact situation: what we should do when we have a chronic case

7
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:32,240
going on and a treatment is
necessary for an acute condition.

8
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:46,040
Usually what we do, the patient telephones
he says I have a cold, give me my remedy

9
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:58,180
and we prescribe. We do this but it is better to know what we are doing when we do that.

10
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:10,550
We have to know the possibilities of spoiling
 the case to what extent we may spoil it,

11
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:23,220
to what extent may help when shall we prescribe, when we shall not prescribe.

12
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:32,680
 What are the questions that you have
when you had cases that are under treatment

13
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:39,690
that need some acute prescribing?
What are the questions that you are having?

14
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:49,240
-What's going on at the moment and what are the symptoms prominent for the time being?

15
00:02:53,650 --> 00:03:02,500
You see first of all we have to put the right questions to understand what is going on.

16
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,420
Which are the right questions?

17
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:18,180
You are in a position now to think for the
different problems that we are having.

18
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:31,450
-Most important for me is how severe the current disease is and how much the patient is suffering.

19
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:36,920
If he doesn't suffer so much and it is
 not so severe I will wait with them;

20
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:44,720
 if it's getting severe I will look for the prominent symptoms and treat along these symptoms.

21
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:57,670
It could be a sign also of changing the
chronic case and I have to combine it.

22
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:06,970
-I think it's important when did I give the last remedy. Did I give it 3 days ago or is it 3 months?

23
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:17,590
-I would ask him if he had known those symptoms already before, long time before.

24
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:27,480
-An aggravation of the symptoms of
the chronic disease in the acute exacerbation.

25
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:34,680
If the symptoms of the chronic disease
just became aggravated now.

26
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,880
-What would you do?

27
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:47,400
-Then I may consider to give the same
remedy and not change to another remedy.

28
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,920
-For me the question would be: is the
acute disease part of the remedy

29
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,300
I have given for the chronic case?

30
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,960
-Very good questions but not all the
questions that you have to ask.

31
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:14,170
There are a lot of questions
to be asked in that situation.

32
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:21,400
I want to give you a general idea
according to which we shall be working.

33
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:38,340
First of all I will separate
4 groups of diseases.

34
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:55,750
You remember the levels on which we have
 been working which are 12 levels symbolically.

35
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:10,980
I will separate these 12 levels in 4.
So each level which we are going to talk

36
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,590
 will contain 3 of the levels
we'll have been talking about.

37
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:26,770
So this first group between 1 and 3rd
level, has organisms

38
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:36,780
which are quite strong and in
these organisms acute diseases,

39
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:57,800
first of all are not frequent and also not severe.

40
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:10,580
A strong organism is not in danger
of having pneumonia and die.

41
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,080
A weak organism there is a possibility
of having pneumonia and die.

42
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:24,260
That is why they say for old people be
afraid of pneumonias

43
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:31,560
because the organism of the old
 people usually is weak.

44
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:44,590
As the organism gets weaker
and weaker what happens?

45
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:51,040
Here in the next group where we have
organism which are weaker and weaker,

46
00:07:51,890 --> 00:08:01,100
number 4,5 and 6 level,
then in this group of diseases we observe

47
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:19,800
acutes are becoming frequent and more severe.

48
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:32,720
Now see the general idea I want you to be
very clear of this general idea because all

49
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:40,290
we're going to talk about is based on this idea.

50
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:49,080
As the organisms are becoming more
and more deeper disturbed,

51
00:08:49,180 --> 00:09:01,900
what happens is that the acutes
which the organisms used to get

52
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:10,500
eventually disappear or if
they appear they are mild.

53
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:40,150
So on group 3 where we have 7, 8
and 9 we have mild acutes or no acutes.

54
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:52,670
And then when we go to the 4th group
where we have the severe chronic diseases,

55
00:09:52,770 --> 00:10:06,630
the end states of diseases, the severe mental disorders, we see no acutes for years.

56
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:15,440
 So here in these levels, no acutes.

57
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:29,200
As a general idea we are talking, I have not
given you details. We'll give examples etc.

58
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:35,090
-Do you consider children between the age
of 6 months and 2 years that have a lot of

59
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:38,840
virus infections, do they belong
to the 2nd group?

60
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:51,060
-Second, yes. Children with acute frequent cystitis, otitis, frequent whatever it is,

61
00:10:51,160 --> 00:11:03,010
they don't have a strong
organism and as they will grow,

62
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:10,690
they will go either one direction or the other,  depending on the treatment.

63
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:22,530
 Children with so many acutes, depending on the treatment, they may go down to these levels

64
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:33,840
and eventually stop having acutes
but we have personality disorders.

65
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:42,290
We have some kind of severe, epilepsy, asthma.

66
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:50,690
-But a child of this age have frequent
 disease but very often not severe.

67
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,280
-Not severe.

68
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:01,040
-Very often they don't need any treatment at all.

69
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:13,880
-I don't know such cases but if you say frequent but not severe, still they will belong to this group.

70
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:31,160
What I want you also to be aware is this: When the children belong to this group, in this group I

71
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:43,470
In this group consider for instance normal
for a child to have the epidemic diseases.

72
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:54,880
These are good organisms and these
children they get the vaccinations

73
00:12:55,580 --> 00:13:07,170
and we observe the child has no epidemic diseases. They have brought the child actually

74
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:17,260
to a group which is quite lower and
 most probably if it goes right down

75
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:27,100
here with no acutes at all, that's very bad
 but the child's defences are going down

76
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,070
 and usually they bring the child
down to these levels where they start

77
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:42,070
having all kinds of different acutes
and most probably they will develop

78
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:50,410
allergic conditions or hay fever etc.

79
00:13:52,630 --> 00:14:02,670
So you have in your mind this idea
when you treat and then in the history

80
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:11,130
 of the case that you take, you see
how the child was developing

81
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:20,900
 from what kind of acutes to what kind of chronic conditions which bring the child to be treated.

82
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:28,520
Then in the very beginning
you see frequent acutes,

83
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:33,090
you know what type of
a person you are treating.

84
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:42,550
If the child was healthy had his
epidemics and went over them

85
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:55,320
the child belongs to upper groups and he will react very well to the homeopathic remedy.

86
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:10,330
Of course, here in this group we have easy success and in this group also.

87
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:18,740
From this group onwards we will
see what kind of successes we have.

88
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:29,880
When we are talking about acute conditions during chronic treatment,

89
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:41,010
we have to be very careful in evaluating
what is going on when an acute comes.

90
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:49,990
In this group the meaning of an acute, the evaluation of an acute has a totally different

91
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:59,900
meaning than an acute in number 3 or 4
group. The evaluation is totally different.

92
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:10,070
 So weaker and weaker, more and more
acutes then eventually less and less acutes

93
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,930
then no acutes finally. That is the idea.

94
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:26,700
The second factor that you are
evaluating in a chronic treatment

95
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:35,280
 is whether your remedy has acted or not.

96
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:45,280
If your remedy has acted, what it means?
It has boosted up the defense mechanism

97
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:53,990
of the organism. Therefore, tell me
 what will happen in the 1st group

98
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,620
if you give the correct homeopathic remedy?

99
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:11,950
These people they get an acute once
twice the year, right? They get a few acutes.

100
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:24,280
You give the correct remedy, what happens?
The acutes should not appear anymore

101
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:36,010
 because the organism is strong
enough and even the acute is mild.

102
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:48,640
So therefore in these upper groups, the acutes after your homeopathic remedy are lessened.

103
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:54,080
They should not have neither so severe

104
00:17:54,340 --> 00:18:01,780
nor so frequent acutes under
 the correct homeopathic treatment.

105
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:09,020
But what we observe in group
number 3 and number 4.

106
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:21,370
Here we have an epileptic child
 who gets some colds, usually mild.

107
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:30,370
The appearance now, after your treatment,
the appearance of an acute in these groups

108
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:40,740
has a totally different meaning. The appearance is a sign that your remedy has acted in depth.

109
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:48,940
 It doesn't matter whether the patient
says, 'I'm better, worse', they're complaining.

110
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:57,740
The moment that in these groups where they had no acutes in the last 6 months or the last year,

111
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:05,530
here usually the story is:
 'I used to get acutes but not lately'.

112
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:12,120
 'How lately?' 'Since one year I don't.
Since two years, mild'.

113
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:22,480
In this group when you see
after your remedy an acute appearing

114
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:28,760
then it's a very good sign.
What you have to do?

115
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:33,090
It's different what you have
 to do during the acutes in these groups

116
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:37,890
than what you have to do in these
groups during the acute condition.

117
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:43,520
It doesn't matter that we are on
the telephone and we prescribe, right?

118
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:52,420
Unless you know very well what is going on,
you are bound to prescribe.

119
00:19:52,520 --> 00:20:01,480
They will tell you 'I have a terrible pimple',
' Ah, you have a pimple, take Calc-s'.

120
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:17,210
'I had a little accident and I turned my finger',
'Ok, take Arn. this, that, Rhus-t, Bry.'.

121
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:24,480
' Ah I'm better, thank you very much'.
Yes he is better but what happens in
the organism is another story.

122
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:34,000
So we have to know when to give. We make mistakes, there is no question about that

123
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:46,980
but we have to know we made a mistake and why we made a mistake and how to correct it.

124
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:52,020
Because you will see treating cases
and they will do beautifully and

125
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:58,130
suddenly the case will be spoiled
and then you don't know why

126
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:03,570
and then you try, you say 'did you drink coffee?
They say, 'no I didn't drink coffee but

127
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:13,760
I went through a coffee shop and it was
smelling very strongly, is that possible?', 'Yes!'

128
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:24,920
I mean you know it's a lie. It's a lie, the
smelling of coffee cannot affect the organism

129
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,920
but you find an excuse for your mistakes.
 It's a good excuse.

130
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:36,680
You have told them not to take the
chewing gum, 'did you eat chewing gum?'

131
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:44,920
'No, but I ate an ice cream and it was
moca ice-cream', 'That's the problem'.

132
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:50,370
That's not the problem, the
problem is that during the acutes

133
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:54,920
acutes you have prescribed
the wrong medication.

134
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:06,040
So you think now is more clear?

135
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:17,000
-In the groups 3 and 4, if I have severe acute disease, do I have to prescribe a remedy or not?

136
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:24,950
-We will be discussing that, I didn't finish,
this is the beginning.

137
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:38,560
And I can warn you this is the most
 interesting information for you

138
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:47,120
to prescribe correctly but it is
complicated and when we finish

139
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,920
maybe you will feel your head go like this.

140
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:57,290
That's why I go slowly so you can
 digest what we are talking.

141
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:07,140
And I would like to hear
your feedback at the moment.

142
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,720
What do you think? What questions
are coming to your mind so far?

143
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:14,510
-George, I give a remedy and the remedy is acting and the patient is coming 2 days after

144
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:18,040
the remedy with a cold for example.

145
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:24,560
-The first group will shall be
discussing will be from 1-3 days

146
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:33,720
after your prescription of the
remedy, you have an acute.

147
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:37,910
We shall be discussing it into
the different groups what it means.

148
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:44,400
It's a good question, you give the
remedy and the next day they phone

149
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:48,560
'I have a cold, I have an acute,
 a cystitis this, that'.

150
00:23:48,660 --> 00:24:00,000
What does it mean? Correct question.

151
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:21,500
-If I have a child which has been vaccinated and it has not had any of the usual children diseases,

152
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:28,860
can I then be sure that it is
due to the vaccinations?

153
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:36,860
-No, you can not be sure. Never you can
be sure of anything in the human body.

154
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:45,800
The human body is so complicated
that it can change course of action,

155
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:59,380
 as I have said, from many many factors
but we give general sign posts, guidelines.

156
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:14,000
As I said many times that: we give
a stimulus to the defense mechanism

157
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:19,650
and the defense mechanism
is bringing up better state of health.

158
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:27,520
That stimulus could come from different
quarters. There are different therapies

159
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:33,670
but I can tell you something which
can be every day experience,

160
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:41,520
 for instance you don't have money
and suddenly you win a lottery

161
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:50,330
and your health may improve in general. Because all this heaviness,

162
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:58,070
 'how do I get money, how do I feed my family',
then the lottery comes and all this stress

163
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:04,940
is going away from the organism and the organism by itself, an organism that belongs

164
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:09,360
only to these two groups, not to that,

165
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:20,600
such stimulus can affect problems
that belong to these two levels.

166
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:31,950
Another condition which makes you feel much better, I mean you are tired and you don't want

167
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:40,630
to live, you have some kind of depression,
your liver is malfunctioning and the digestion

168
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:44,810
is not so good, different foods are affecting you.

169
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:56,330
This is a syndrome which cannot be
put into a category of a pathology,

170
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:03,860
yet you don't have chronic fatigue syndrome,
 you don't have an ulcer etc.

171
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:16,320
But there is a syndrome where you feel
rotten and suddenly you meet one nice night

172
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:30,170
a woman or a boy and there is a rapport and suddenly you wake up in the morning and you

173
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:37,490
 are not tired. You wake up and you want to
go to work and in the night you want

174
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:50,370
to meet and if this continues that stimulation
from both sides, this is a therapeutic state.

175
00:27:50,740 --> 00:28:07,270
 In the same way I have seen many times
people going into a revelation from God,

176
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:17,890
 whatever they maybe, and then this stimulation that God is with me, that I'm with God

177
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:24,480
this stimulation is strong, I have seen
in the American television,

178
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:37,650
you see people getting up and say I feel great.
It is a similar stimulation of the defence

179
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:49,260
 mechanism but remember if this happens
then your patient belongs to these 2 groups.

180
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:57,620
In this group, what is going to happen?
Can anybody tell me what is going to happen

181
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:08,290
under such stimulus in these two groups?

182
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:12,140
-The people easier get infections?

183
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,880
-No.

184
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:23,960
-The acute disease gets its stronger expression.

185
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:32,600
-I think to these people it can
lead to an aggravation.

186
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:35,790
-No.

187
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,230
-I think you have an amelioration
for a short period of time and

188
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:52,820
then you have an aggravation again.

189
00:29:53,020 --> 00:30:00,360
-That is going to happen, very good.
You see little ones are sometimes....

190
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:12,480
In these conditions the underlying pathology
 is such that will not allow for a constant

191
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:18,600
or complete amelioration, it will
allow for a short amelioration.

192
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:29,690
You see the idea of ahhh, then it is relieved
for a period of time, then, back again.

193
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:49,090
Here in the last stages actually such stimulus is very very difficult to bring any kind of reaction,

194
00:30:49,190 --> 00:31:08,240
in the very last stages I'm talking about
11,12, near death, I mean hope is lost.

195
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:26,050
-There are reports about cancer cases who have cured themselves with autogenic training

196
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:32,560
and can we say that these cancer
cases are from the second group?

197
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:40,880
-No, the cancer cases, as we have discussed many times there are different types of cancer,

198
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:47,730
the cancer cases which are curable
belong actually to this group, the 1st group.

199
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:54,940
What kind of diseases you will see
 in this group here?

200
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:09,210
What are the conditions for which the patient
will come to be treated in a homeopath?

201
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:17,930
Just mention a few, just to know if you understand the meaning.

202
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:32,550
-Like smallpox and also might be
frequent cold in winter.

203
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:41,540
-No, for common cold nobody will ever
come to the homeopath for the first time.

204
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:47,010
Just forget it. Usually they will come
for a chronic condition.

205
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:52,360
What type of chronic condition you will get?

206
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:59,320
-I think skin diseases.

207
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,590
-Diseases of the skin, yes.

208
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:15,810
-Cases of chronic mental state which they never had an acute disease like autism for example.

209
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:19,660
I had a case with a child who had
autism and after the homeopathic

210
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,780
 remedy he developed frequent acute diseases.

211
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:28,210
-No, these cases do not belong to the first group.

212
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:39,260
I'm asking what type of pathology
you will place in the first group?

213
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,560
-Migraine headaches?

214
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,480
-Yes.

215
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:08,280
Acute tonsillitis?

216
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:13,830
-Tonsillitis is an acute condition. I'm talking about chronic conditions which come to be treated,

217
00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:19,950
 tonsillitis is an acute condition that may
appear. Still my question is not clear.

218
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:26,340
-Allergic diseases? Conjuctivitis,
if it's deeper like asthma.

219
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:41,290
-Yes, chronic conjunctivitis.

220
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,890
-Chronic rhinitis?

221
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:54,820
-Yes.

222
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:01,280
-Any kind of pains without
pathologoanatomical correlation.

223
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,640
-Yes but give me some examples.

224
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:12,800
-Back pains for example.

225
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,280
-Lumbago, yes.

226
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:42,610
-Duodenal ulcer, a mild one yes.

227
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:51,650
-Warts.

228
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:10,490
-Sinusitis.

229
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:34,840
-Irregular menstruation and
premenstrual syndrome.

230
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,970
-Hay fever?

231
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:51,520
-Hay fever I will not put it on this group.
It will be coming down.

232
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:02,690
-Affections of the joints?

233
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:21,680
-Yes like arthritis, rheumatism, rheumatic
pains, arthritic pains, not osteoarthritis.

234
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:35,790
Osteoarthritis will come on the lower part
of the second group or on this group,

235
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:40,800
even in the third group.

236
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,010
-Disorders like diarrhea and constipation.

237
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:59,690
-Chronic diarrhea and constipation. Simple.

238
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:09,800
The moment they become chronic
severe spastic colitis or ulcerative colitis,

239
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:16,170
they enter into this group. Spastic colitis
and uncreative colitis will come here.

240
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:37,240
Give me some diseases which belong
to this second group like hay-fever,

241
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:55,630
spastic colitis, asthma, asthmatic
conditions but not severe.

242
00:38:56,260 --> 00:39:04,490
The moment asthmatic condition becomes
really severe they descend into the third group.

243
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:24,880
Fever convulsions like epileptic conditions
with all kinds of convulsions yes.

244
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:32,430
-Chronic cystitis, chronic bronchitis.
- Yes.

245
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,340
-I think palpitation goes to the first group.

246
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:10,150
-Simple palpitation can go there but once the palpitation becomes more complicated

247
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:19,580
where we have arythmias and functional disturbances of the heart, it will go to 2nd group.

248
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:35,440
Where you will place the chronic fatigue syndrome which we see today quite frequently?

249
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:45,770
Who says second group? Who says second group? Who says third group? Good, ok.

250
00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:02,690
-Hypertension I would put on the second group.

251
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:15,540
-Hypertension once it is simple idiopathic hypertension, no real cause,

252
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:21,400
we may place it on the second group here.

253
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:45,760
But if hypertension, esp. if the lower part is
very high indicating most probably sclerosis

254
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:54,000
of the arteries then you go to the third group.

255
00:41:54,100 --> 00:42:02,490
You will see it is very interesting what
I tell you, you will see it in your practice.

256
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:12,940
For instance the person will come with hypertension and I say the peripheral blood

257
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:25,040
pressure is high indicating arteriosclerosis
and you will ask them if they get acutes

258
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:39,330
and you will see the acutes have minimized. Anyhow as a rule, the moment you hear that

259
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:52,630
'I was having frequent colds etc. and since one year I don't get so frequently', you calculate

260
00:42:52,730 --> 00:43:05,460
 from that time the organism has gone down
to level three. Pathology is more strong

261
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:14,170
and you are going to have a difficulty in treating such cases, it's not going to be an easy case.

262
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:27,360
Whenever the acutes have minimized while they were there before, you have a difficult case.

263
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:38,830
Can you mention a few diseases that
you will see in this fourth group?

264
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:54,360
-Schizophrenia yes, manic depression,
juvenile diabetes.

265
00:43:55,510 --> 00:44:13,370
-Depression with severe suicidal tendencies
it will go to the lower part of the third group,

266
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:28,450
it is manageable but sometimes it is quite deep and you can say it belongs to the fourth group.

267
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:36,960
-Difficulties in concentration and forgetfulness.

268
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:46,840
-Difficulties in concentration is curable and it belongs to the 2nd, at the most the 3rd group.

269
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:54,930
The 4th group we have deep pathology and you have to understand what is deep pathology.

270
00:44:55,430 --> 00:45:04,950
-What about the autommune diseases like
the Chron's disease, the multiple sclerosis?

271
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:11,520
Ok, the Chron's disease where we have ulcerative colitis, where it'll be?

272
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:14,490
Third group.

273
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:20,940
-Multiple sclerosis which group?

274
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,320
-Fourth.

275
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:35,890
-No, multiple sclerosis belongs to this group initially as it is left to go on for years then

276
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:41,110
it drops in the fourth level and
it becomes incurable.

277
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:47,880
In the beginning state of multiple sclerosis
it is curable with Homeopathy.

278
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:58,560
I try to give you my experience
but it is not possible to give it.

279
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:05,330
That' s why I put the questions
if you get the ideas.

280
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:15,700
-The functional deterioration of organs.,
ex. when kidneys are deteriorated.

281
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:33,140
-Yes, severe nephritis in which heart diseases,
in which cases we don't have the possibility to

282
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:36,520
bring about a cure, belong to this.

283
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:43,520
But nephritis in the beginning belongs
to number 3 group, it's curable.

284
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:59,260
Heart conditions in the beginning stages
belong here. When pathology is established,

285
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:11,760
in the beginning stages if we catch it most of them are curable and belong to the 3rd group.

286
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:25,090
Either the first level 7,8 some times
9 which is very close to 4th group.

287
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:29,340
- In number 4 Alzheimer's disease?

288
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:43,310
-Alzheimer's definitely belongs to
here last or it is going there.

289
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:56,870
I think it's the same for other diseases like
CHD -can drop from 3 to 4- and cancer.

290
00:47:56,970 --> 00:48:02,230
-AIDS?

291
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:17,930
-Lower 3 to 4 and what you will see
in most of the cases of AIDS,

292
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:25,960
at least in the beginning stages
where AIDS was developing as an

293
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:35,320
epidemic what was the observation?
That these people with strong organisms,

294
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:41,550
they were getting gonorrhea, syphillis
and sexually transmitted diseases

295
00:48:41,850 --> 00:48:47,610
very frequently. And they took antibiotics and more antibiotics and they treated and treated.

296
00:48:50,510 --> 00:49:04,550
Most of AIDS cases have come down from
no.1 to no.4 due to excessive treatment.

297
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:13,830
Have you digested this?
We're going to a new idea.

298
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:30,680
If no.3 group gets an acute which is not mild,

299
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:40,320
sometimes they can get an acute
which is not mild, then this acute

300
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:47,450
be life threatening, it's going to kill the person.

301
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:54,920
Here is the confusion of Medicine.

302
00:49:55,570 --> 00:50:12,600
You see we had this example with the last President of Democracy of Greece, Karamanlis.

303
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:23,370
He entered the hospital with
bronchitis at the age of 92

304
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:38,310
and immediately jumped with
antibiotics, what happened?

305
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:44,220
The organism went a little bit up
and back again, then more antibiotics,

306
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:48,550
a little bit up and back again.
More antibiotics, the kidneys

307
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:53,970
start breaking down, then more antibiotics
 the heart started breaking down.

308
00:50:54,070 --> 00:51:02,880
Actually in two weeks you had him supported
for his lungs, for his kidneys,

309
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:11,040
supported for his heart, 10 days later he died.

310
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:21,120
Now because his organism was 92
he was belonging to this group.

311
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:32,390
If we were called to treat him
homeopathically there were more chances

312
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:39,750
of surviving than allopathically. Of course the chance was also to die under homeopathic

313
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:51,570
 treatment but since his organism was strong enough even in 92 and not having much acutes.

314
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:59,520
But the moment he gets an acute here,
it is serious.

315
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:14,370
So in these groups in 3 and 4, if by chance an acute becomes very strong it's life threatening.

316
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:30,840
In the mental asylum you will see a schizo-phrenic getting a high fever 40-41 degree,

317
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:38,050
got a pneumonia, he's going to die.

318
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:47,220
What will happen if we give homeopathic treatment to such a case?

319
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:52,450
Maybe there is a chance because all
these people they have a chance with the

320
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:59,260
 correct homeopathic treatment, one remedy,
 the second correct, the third correct.

321
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:09,090
To raise eventually and to have
what we call miracle cures,

322
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:19,800
it's very difficult, not always you can do.
That's why we cannot say, ok leave it

323
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:23,810
and we'll jump into the picture and
we'll cure the person.

324
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:30,690
You have to know where he belongs this person and to know the severity and to know how much

325
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:34,880
serious the condition is and not superficially.

326
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:42,140
People having seen some cure of
cancer they say, we can cure cancer

327
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,550
and of course the person dies.

328
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:55,580
So we have to understand really what is
going on before we claim anything.

329
00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:02,850
Where will you place rheumatoid arthritis?

330
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:14,290
-In the second group if
is a healthy organism.

331
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:25,070
Third group?

332
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:36,200
-All collagen diseases, like ulcerative colitis, like lupus erythymatosus, like rheumatoid arthritis,

333
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:43,830
like psoriasis belong to the third group.

334
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:57,720
Difficult to be treated and
really bring them to total cure.

335
00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:09,650
-In which group would you place
a progressive paralysis?

336
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:21,460
-For instance to talk more specifically,
ALS, severe neuromuscular disease

337
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:28,080
belongs to the fourth group, forget the cure.

338
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:39,360
Myasthenia, myopathy, they are coming
lower third group to the fourth.

339
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:45,320
Neuromuscular diseases of
any degenerative kind,

340
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:52,570
they belong to the lower 3rd
group or even to the 4th.

341
00:55:52,670 --> 00:56:00,440
You are going to battle in such
cases keeping them in this level.

342
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,850
Even if you keep them steady or you
improve them a little it's a big success

343
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:24,870
but to expect that you will cure
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, forget it.

344
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:29,560
-The hyperactive children do
they belong to the third group?

345
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:37,560
-The hyperactive children belong to the 3rd
group but the autistic children belong to the 4th.

346
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:51,490
-Neurofibromatosis belongs to the third group?

347
00:56:51,560 --> 00:57:02,920
-Lower third to fourth.
You are getting the idea?
