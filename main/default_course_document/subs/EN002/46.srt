1
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,420
He's doing well for 6 months. He gets an acute.

2
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:29,800
Maybe the acute is going to pass by itself,
you don't need to prescribe.

3
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:49,580
If the acute becomes really bad, then you
think of prescribing of course and

4
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:59,000
if the acute symptoms do not point to a clear remedy you repeat the original remedy.

5
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:15,870
Because in 6 months the remedy should have lasted longer; it has not exhausted its action

6
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:24,880
normally but in case that the acute is quite
 strong and requires treatment, it means that

7
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,360
 something has happened in between here
 which has depleted the organism and the

8
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:37,120
organism has gone back. So most
probably after this acute

9
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:41,610
you will have back the chronic
condition and you will have to

10
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:52,250
 repeat the remedy. But if the symptoms
 of this acute are not clear

11
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:58,800
 you can always give the Calcarea carbonica which you prescribed originally.

12
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,560
And most probably that will go away and
the person will continue to be well.

13
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:11,240
But if it is mild you just wait.

14
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:30,010
In one year, most probably the
remedy is antidoted and again

15
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:36,800
 the same observation  with the 6 months.

16
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:56,040
I was in the office the other day and by chance the camera was there from the German

17
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:09,690
channel and a woman approaches me and
she said, 'do you remember me?', I said, 'no

18
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:16,940
 don't remember you'. She said, '20 years ago
 I came with a thyroid problem and you cured it

19
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:26,470
within 2 months. I came twice she says, 20
 years ago'. 'How are you doing all these years?'.

20
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:35,680
I'm doing quite well, I came to see you.
She was 65 perhaps by the time I met her;

21
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:41,780
 I could not remember anything but this is the experience from a good homeopathic remedy

22
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:53,490
if belongs to this problem. She had a
thyroid problem but in the beginning;

23
00:03:53,710 --> 00:04:08,380
you take the remedy, the thyroid
will not progress to go into malignancy.

24
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:21,330
Now here things are a bit different in this group; because in this group the organism has gone

25
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:28,500
 down because of some chronic pathology
and the acutes are becoming more frequent.

26
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:42,210
 The organism is affected much more by
 different bacteria, viruses, etc.

27
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:49,920
Then you start having common
colds, influenzas, cystitis

28
00:04:52,020 --> 00:05:05,170
together with some anxieties
or rheumatic conditions etc.

29
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:45,500
You give a remedy and within the first few
days you have the acute which they usually get.

30
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,180
What does it mean?

31
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:58,840
He has come to be treated for thyroid problems and she says at the same time that

32
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:07,000
'frequently I get cystitis'. You give
the remedy, you give Thyroidinum,

33
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:13,730
 the second day, the third day she
says, 'I have the cystitis'.

34
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,060
Are you going to treat it?

35
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,860
-No.

36
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,140
-What does it mean?

37
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,160
-It should be a little bit more mild than usually.

38
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,950
 If it's milder then the remedy was
correct and you have to wait.

39
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:52,310
-Again we can see if it is better than usual.
It may happen, as I said, that the cystitis has

40
00:06:52,410 --> 00:07:02,560
started already before the treatment and if it is milder, you wait. Now what happens in this

41
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:17,820
 case here is that because of the acute the action of this remedy will be exhausted much earlier.

42
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:24,110
 So the acute seems to take a lot
of the action of the remedy

43
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:29,080
and seems to shorten the duration of action.
If this remedy you have given, 200 was going

44
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:41,240
 to act for a year or two, it may act only for 3 months due to the fact that you have an acute.

45
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:51,160
The acute brings down the organism in any case.

46
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:02,230
The acute comes after 7 days, what it means?

47
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:25,310
- The lady has a thyroid problem and
chronic cystitis at the same time.

48
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:30,240
And if I give the remedy and the
cystitis comes back I would rather

49
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:38,290
think it is an aggravation of the remedy
than an acute, so I wouldn't give anything.

50
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:46,070
-You would not give anything. Somebody else?

51
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:57,250
-In this case I would give a new prescription because I think also there is a deep aggravation

52
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:02,970
 of the cystitis; I think it's a normal
aggravation of the working remedy,

53
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:07,280
I would do nothing for the first month.

54
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:19,280
-If we assume that there was no cystitis
in the beginning of the treatment

55
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,600
and after 7 days, she gets cystitis
then the remedy was wrong.

56
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:35,610
-Here, you have the possibility within
the first few days to get an aggravation,

57
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:46,750
a cystitis which they will call it very bad
cystitis the worse they ever had.

58
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:57,490
If that is the case, instead of being milder, the cystitis is much worse, what it means?

59
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:02,080
Nobody wants to answer this.

60
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,420
-I still wouldn't treat because we don't know the history. Well you might have taken the history

61
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:15,160
if she had many episodes of cystitis that
has been suppressed with medication,

62
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:20,370
 then one of the reasons that it make flare up very violent is because the system is

63
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:24,930
to clear itself a bit. So I wouldn't treat.

64
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:38,600
-You see it may happen that with the correct remedy the cystitis has started one day before

65
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:43,450
and you give the correct remedy
 and you give a high potency.

66
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:55,910
It may happen that you get a very violent aggravation in the first few days. Then wait.

67
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:06,770
Here in this case where she gets immediately after the remedy a usual cystitis,

68
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:18,380
you assume that your remedy has done nothing. If it is better than usual, the remedy is acting,

69
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,300
 if it is worse than usual the remedy
is acting, if it is the same,

70
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:34,390
 your remedy has done nothing. And of course you may be treating or not treating the cystitis

71
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:40,150
here per se or the best is to try
 and find another remedy.

72
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:54,920
You go after 7 days and the cystitis appeared.

73
00:11:55,030 --> 00:12:02,850
It has to be milder in order to assume
that your remedy has acted.

74
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:16,570
The cystitis is the same or a kind of worse,
 your remedy has not acted.

75
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,880
After a month, cystitis, your
remedy has not acted.

76
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:30,010
 Definitely here, your remedy has not acted because the organism has enough time

77
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:36,070
to recover from the correct remedy,
therefore it will reduce the frequency

78
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,800
 and the intensity of the acutes.

79
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:50,620
So acute here, forget it,
your remedy was incorrect.

80
00:12:54,660 --> 00:13:05,810
After 6 months an acute, if she is
doing well for several months,

81
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:16,160
 it means a relapse and it means
the remedy has been antidoted.

82
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:27,500
-I have a patient with a lumbago and
I give Rhus-t or Bry or whatever is indicated

83
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:34,680
 and he tells me, 'I frequently get colds' and the lumbago vanishes and after 3 months is totally

84
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:39,280
gone and he gets a really bad cold.
Would you say the remedy didn't act or

85
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:48,280
how could I interpret it?

86
00:13:52,530 --> 00:14:09,000
-You remember we have said, we
can be treating a case on a level.

87
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:30,250
Rhus-t which is the lumbago which has been upon, it is like something upon the basic

88
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:36,880
underlying remedy which is
Calcarea carbonica.

89
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:51,750
If this is the case, this remedy will have
 touched only upon the lumbago, nothing else.

90
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:56,120
The person himself does not feel different.

91
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:08,520
I'm talking about the remedy which has
been given for an underlying condition.

92
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:17,800
 The same thing can happen with Ignatia.
 These people here, they can come with a

93
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:24,960
concussion, you give Arnica, it will be cured.
They come with grief. You give Ignatia, they

94
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:33,070
 are cured. I'm not talking about this. I'm
talking about a remedy which goes deeper

95
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:45,890
and affects the whole of the person not
the symptomatology of a super imposed

96
00:15:45,940 --> 00:16:13,070
condition. Because with this we are clear.
He has an otitis, you give Cham., it's gone.

97
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:26,240
 In children you have dental problems
you give Cham, it is gone.

98
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:35,770
The child who is suffering at the same time with chronic otitis, the otitis will not be affected

99
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:45,940
when you give Camomilla for her teeth.
But if you have given a remedy for the

100
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:52,980
 underlying condition which is the otitis,
now teeth are coming, the child is crying

101
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:59,530
you give Cham, the child stops crying,
the teeth are growing, the otitis continues.

102
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:08,760
You give now the Mercury which is for the otitis and you want to observe what is happening.

103
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:25,220
People can have something acute or
temporary that creates on top of it some

104
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:34,600
 pattern of a remedy.
You will have to give that first.

105
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:49,730
These people here, very severe pathology,
 they still can feel grief and they can still have

106
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:56,280
an Ignatia or a Natrum muriaticum symptomatology.

107
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:04,960
You give first this, you take out the
grief and then you start treating.

108
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:13,520
Still these people may have some
 mild form of acutes. You may be treating

109
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:21,750
because the mild form of acutes
gives you the idea of Bry; you give Bry,

110
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:28,620
you treat and after that you start
treating the multiple sclerosis,

111
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:37,200
the neuromuscular disorder, the severe
 thyroid conditions, the leukemia etc.

112
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:46,390
- For this temporary acute illness
of it there is no past existence at all,

113
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:51,130
it is a totally new unconnected disease
that the patient hasn't had before.

114
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:55,120
If we are treating a chronic case
and we've just given the remedy,

115
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:59,000
would be the acute and then how long
will be for the action to exhaust

116
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:04,950
 before we resume the previous
prescription of the chronic illness?

117
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:10,560
- Now in these two groups you have to
pass judgement whether you treat or not.

118
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:21,140
If you have done a good work in studying your case and you have seen some action of the

119
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:28,910
remedy as I said, mostly you will not treat the acutes in these two groups, as I said, unless

120
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:41,790
after a month it gets cystitis again.

121
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:47,470
Most probably the idea is
your remedy has done nothing.

122
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:59,140
But in this group as a general idea the appearance of acutes is not a good sign

123
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:07,860
 and it points out to the idea that your
remedy is not working properly.

124
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:33,480
An acute after a year, in this group  for a year the person goes well, your remedy was correct.

125
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:47,310
Here you have a relapse, the first
thing you think is repeat the remedy.

126
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:56,910
 A person who stayed well with his chronic condition plus their acutes and went better

127
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:03,710
 in general, you don't change the remedy, the remedy was correct, you repeat the remedy.

128
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:21,550
In 3 years, the same. Repeat the remedy.
 It means also that in 3 years,

129
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:34,030
this organism is on the upper
level of the second group.

130
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:39,750
 If the person stays well for 3
years with your remedy and

131
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:52,960
 does not get colds, influenza, cystitis etc.
you can assume your remedy was

132
00:21:53,060 --> 00:22:00,550
acting very well and you don't leave
that remedy and then you repeat the

133
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:08,780
remedy in the same potency, it doesn't work.
You go higher, it doesn't work, you go higher.

134
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:16,310
 You don't give up the remedy in such
a case. The remedy is going to act.

135
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:19,280
I told you it's a little bit difficult that subject,

136
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:26,210
that's why I left one day to go
down and digest the issue.

137
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:37,520
Listen now how different things
are as we go down the scale.

138
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:49,120
Here, group 3 where you have mild
acutes or no acutes, the person says,

139
00:22:50,300 --> 00:23:01,750
'well sometimes I have acutes'
 or 'last acute was two years ago'.

140
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:17,880
 That' s not a good sign. You give your
remedy and the next day or day after,

141
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:30,740
within 3 days, here pops up
an acute. What does it mean?

142
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:38,960
 It means a very good reaction,
a fantastic reaction!

143
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:43,740
You cannot have anything better than that!

144
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:52,080
Therefore you say, wait don't touch this acute.

145
00:23:52,440 --> 00:24:06,400
Not only that but most probably the acute
 in this condition will be quite severe

146
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:14,970
but not deadly, not endangering
 the life of the person.

147
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:31,100
In this group also belongs a reaction which
we see sometimes with Homeopathy

148
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:42,810
which is the appearance of high fever,
sudden high fever without any reason,

149
00:24:42,980 --> 00:25:00,660
40 degrees fever. 1,2 days, the 3rd day is
gone. It appears usually in asthma cases

150
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:12,140
it is a very good sign and in epilepsy cases.
 I have seen in both of these cases, many times

151
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:20,320
that type of reaction. Now, if you get
upset and you try to treat the fever,

152
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:29,440
 you give Acon., you give Bry., this, that, within 2 days you can spoil your case.

153
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:42,200
So the information about acutes will always give us an idea where the person finds his organism

154
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:57,240
a in gross pathology or not and whether our treatment is going to be easy or difficult.

155
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:12,370
You get the cases with ulcerative colitis and this is usually aggravated with a lot of antibiotics.

156
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:21,050
Why? Because they are getting frequent
 acutes, a lot of antibiotics, eventually colitis,

157
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:36,750
 eventually ulcerative colitis. For the last year no acutes. You give the remedy and the 3rd day

158
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:47,270
you have the appearance of a cold, of a bronchitis, of a pneumonia, of whatever.

159
00:26:49,160 --> 00:27:00,040
Very good sign, there is possibility for a cure.
The organism in spite of the fact of having

160
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:12,840
deep pathology, with the first remedy will have
 a beautiful recovery, with the first remedy.

161
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:22,890
As long as the acute comes
immediately after your prescription.

162
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:34,290
Now you treat these cases and the acute
 comes on the 7th day, what does that mean?

163
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:39,830
-I think it's also a good sign of an
aggravation because you don't know

164
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:43,580
 in what state exactly the
patient was when he came.

165
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:51,910
-Very good. It's also a very good sign.
One week after your remedy,

166
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:57,520
it doesn't matter whether
this person is better or not.

167
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:10,530
This colitis might be the same
or a little bit better or worse.

168
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:18,790
It doesn't matter once the acute appears
 in 7 days, the person is getting better.

169
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:23,270
You can predict the cure.

170
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:30,200
-I take this case of the ulcerative colitis and you give the remedy and after 2 days

171
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,870
she has pneumonia or high fever,
you will not treat?

172
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:45,720
-Well, there is one general rule, when in
 danger always treat, nevermind what.

173
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:51,490
Treat with anything that will
save the life of the patient.

174
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:58,150
 You give antibiotics, you give
cortisone, whatever you like

175
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:04,080
as long as the danger goes away,
 if there is a real danger.

176
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:16,360
That is why it is important to know quite well clinical medicine, to understand pathology.

177
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:26,240
So you know when a case is really in
danger and when it is not in danger or

178
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:33,840
 you think it is in danger. So the
 problem is even with the  young doctors

179
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:39,150
 who don't have experience,
you know how many people

180
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:42,480
they send to the hospital without reason?

181
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:49,130
Because they are terrified, they cannot
evaluate whether this case is dangerous or

182
00:29:49,180 --> 00:30:00,530
 if this is normal case. I have noticed here in Greece because we have the rule that

183
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:17,700
all young doctors have to go to rural cases like in villages, don't stay in cities to do their practice.

184
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:24,580
They go out of the University, they send them without experience to treat

185
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,410
 the rural population of Greece.
What has happened?

186
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:34,100
Greece was having one of the
highest life expectancy until 1970.

187
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:41,900
If you look at the statistics,
now it's going down, down

188
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,880
 because the young doctors
 without knowing.... what do you have?

189
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:55,370
A cold, give antibiotics. Influenza, antibiotics.
But when you have a virus antibiotics

190
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:59,430
are not good. They say, 'yes but
he had some coughing,

191
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:03,820
 I heard some wheezing and
you go to the hospital.

192
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,260
You know how many people
were sent to the hospital?

193
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:19,140
Until 1970 here there was no pharmacy. Population would live long time.

194
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:26,710
Today we have two pharmacies doing
a lot, the same population.

195
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,110
Two pharmacies are selling a lot of medication.

196
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:34,290
Who is taking all this medication?
 The population. Why?

197
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:40,000
Because everybody feels I'm sick now
and they have to take medicine.

198
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:56,750
There are cases that are serious but you have
 to have experience to realize that this is a

199
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:03,880
serious case, to realise that you have
 given a remedy and has not acted.

200
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:12,430
Myself I have treated several
cases of pneumonia.

201
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:21,990
In some of these cases we are not
successful, then after the appropriate time

202
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:38,360
you give antibiotics though I claim that Homeopathy can treat even severe cases,

203
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:48,130
even meningitis. Meningitis?
Ah, give me antibiotics, cortisone

204
00:32:48,320 --> 00:33:01,880
yet Homeopathy has proven that
can treat even severe acutes like meningitis.

205
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:11,240
-In this case that Margaret mentioned when
you have in group 3 a dangerous acute

206
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:14,600
a few days after you have given the remedy

207
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:21,960
would you prefer to give antibiotics
rather than treat homeopathically?

208
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:29,190
-In this case you have an acute,
it is quite strong, quite severe.

209
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:34,960
Usually if you have acutes here
they are going to be strong, quite severe;

210
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:41,160
you give antibiotics you just return
back to the original condition.

211
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:48,400
I was in Italy and I was explaining
to them that situation.

212
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:58,110
Two of the doctors got up, one says, 'I had a
 case' - at the moment the teaching is going on.

213
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:04,920
He said, 'I had a case of severe
depression of a medical doctor',

214
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:08,040
he himself was a medical
 doctor, the patient.

215
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:12,790
So the other doctor prescribed
for him Lycopodium.

216
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:24,800
After 4 days there was a severe
pancreatitis appearing.

217
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:36,980
Which pancreatitis he had five years ago
and by the time I was teaching them,

218
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:48,440
the patient doctor was in the hospital  and
they were trying to treat him in the hospital.

219
00:34:54,200 --> 00:35:00,450
 He was not responding to the treatment
and he was in intensive care unit.

220
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:13,800
I said, try to repeat to give Lyc. again.
 Because it is endangering the life

221
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:20,400
you have to treat. The best way to
do it is by the same remedy,

222
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:24,840
 by a repetition of the same remedy.

223
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:32,920
Let us take the example of yesterday
with the Lachesis case.

224
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:39,730
After Lachesis, he develops an acute.
He says, 'I have a sinusitis'.

225
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:51,070
This sinusitis if you leave it untreated,
 it will become quite severe sinusitis.

226
00:35:51,420 --> 00:36:03,170
Now he takes a repetition of the remedy Lach., and the sinusitis disappears beautifully.

227
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:12,600
That is the case that belongs
to the upper third group.

228
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:24,530
-I just wanted to tell you about a case
that I had and I think it was the same.

229
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:31,120
 Actually it was my mother so
it was quite frightening.

230
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:41,930
I gave her about a year ago, Bryonia.
She had rheumatic problems,

231
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:44,870
problems with all her joints,
she used to take cortisone for

232
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:51,510
and slowly she dropped the cortisone
and I gave her Bryonia which she took for

233
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:58,250
a day or two, low potency and
then she started having symptoms of

234
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:03,720
crying, fighting with everybody
and I told her to stop.

235
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:07,580
But within 1 month or 2 everything finished.

236
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:12,310
 All the problems she had with rheumatic
which was for a few years, finished.

237
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:18,310
Then a year later she said it's starting a little bit again and she started the cortisone

238
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:24,960
and finished and I told her to
take the Bryonia again.

239
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:33,560
I said, 'take it' because mentally
she was a little bit... and she took it

240
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:42,760
and next day she had a strong pneumonia,
 it was really difficult and she didn't take nothing.

241
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:48,220
 She let it go but then she had
to take very strong antibiotics.

242
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,760
 I asked her: 'do you think it was because
 of the remedy, just after the remedy?'

243
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:56,580
 She said, 'no I think a had a
 cold a little bit before'.

244
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:06,410
So I felt a little bit better but I've seen her before she took it and I didn't see that she had a cold;

245
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:14,560
 so it puzzled me and it really gave me cold
 feet to treat people especially at this age.

246
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:20,260
But now that you say it, I feel a little
bit better and since then she is very good,

247
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:24,970
she is fine with rheumatic and
everything. It is a few months already.

248
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:42,060
-Your mother belongs to this group here or maybe even to the uppermost here, the 3rd.

249
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:52,090
The appearance of pneumonia, shows that
the ground, the organism is on another level

250
00:38:52,180 --> 00:39:02,540
 all together that was before. Because we
have in our organism all the microbes.

251
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:12,820
Why don't we get infected? Because this particular streptococcus or staphylococcus

252
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,350
does not have good ground to develop.

253
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:26,260
The good ground is actually
many times a good sign.

254
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:35,370
 Once you bring the organism to the point
 where now the staphylococcal infection

255
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:44,310
can be developing, then you have
brought up a level the patient

256
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:51,500
and then you have to treat
homeopathically and then you will

257
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:56,920
realize the difference which
is tremendous in the level of health.

258
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:10,650
I say that these cases which they
 belong here, if they are treated correctly,

259
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:18,450
because there are severe reactions in this
level most probably you will need to treat

260
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:28,810
and if they are treated correctly
the organism is really released.

261
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:36,960
And I will go further. You see the
further you go from the reaction,

262
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:42,920
the more severe and most probably
the most dangerous will be the reaction.

263
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:49,320
-Question to the patient with pancreatitis.
If you repeat the remedy do you principally

264
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:54,630
give the same potency or would you
go higher with the potency?

265
00:40:54,740 --> 00:41:01,900
-Yes you give the same potency
and you repeat it every 3 hours.

266
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:12,840
 It is a severe case endangering life, therefore the force of the disease is very strong.

267
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:23,240
 It is very interesting that the suppression of the pancreatitis 5 years ago, brought about what?

268
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:27,970
A state of deep depression,
mental depression

269
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:36,180
and the man was really suffering,
 tremendously and then the pancreatitis

270
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:40,690
comes and you see it is really
dangerous, you have to treat.

271
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:46,940
As long as you feel that the
 person is able to support that,

272
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:55,600
 you wait until you see the remedy is clear.

273
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,760
Once you see the remedy
is clear, you prescribe.

274
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:12,110
-I've seen twice children whose parents
were medical doctors and both of them,

275
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:16,510
one Tuberculinum child and one Medorrhinum child and it was in the beginning and I wasn't

276
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:23,070
sure about the remedy and both developed pneumonia 11 and 10 days after the remedy.

277
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:29,500
Severe pneumonia and I had to treat them because the parents wouldn't accept it.

278
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:34,150
Both of them had very severe behavioral problems. 3,5 and 4 years old.

279
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:46,410
To both of them after I finished
 the antibiotic treatment,

280
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:52,200
I repeated the remedy one potency higher.
One of them got pneumonia back

281
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:56,750
 homeopathically and it healed wonderfully.
 So then afterwards I was sure,

282
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:07,450
it had been the right remedy and that was 3 years ago and they are ok, they are much better.

283
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:13,970
-Very good. These are the examples that you will see again and again in your practice.

284
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:18,240
But whether you give antibiotics
 or you don't give antibiotics

285
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:22,660
the idea is that you have to
know  what is going on.

286
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:27,650
 Don't say, 'oh they gave me the wrong
 remedy or I gave the wrong remedy'

287
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:35,190
 when the remedy is the correct one.
I've heard that many times,

288
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:42,780
 'ah it was the wrong remedy because he developed pneumonia'.

289
00:43:42,880 --> 00:44:15,080
Here in this group has behavioural problems.

290
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:19,750
 They belong to this group and children with behavioral problems do not develop acutes

291
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:30,010
or develop mild acutes. The moment you
treat them they will start with the acutes,

292
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:36,160
they go to this level. Where they
get acutes one after the other.

293
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:56,870
 And if you treat here in this group autistic children, the acutes can be devastating

294
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:02,650
 during these acutes if you manage
to treat with the correct remedy,

295
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:08,760
you will see miracles.
If you don't you just lose everything.

296
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:11,640
Everything comes back.

297
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:20,120
-What would be in the case like group 3
you have that severe depression and

298
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:25,580
I give the remedy and now I get the acute pancreatitis and I have to treat that pancreatitis

299
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:32,320
 because it is so severe. The acute symptoms of the pancreatitis which show different symptoms

300
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,560
not the symptoms of Lyc but for
example the symptoms of Phos,

301
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:40,060
do I give Lyc nevertheless
or do I give Phos?

302
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:50,930
-No, you give Phos if you have the picture.
But usually in such severe, quick reactions

303
00:45:51,020 --> 00:46:02,530
of the organism, you don't get
clear symptoms of the acute.

304
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:08,250
What are you going to do? If you have
 clear symptoms of Phos, give Phos

305
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:15,890
but if you don't, then you just repeat the
 potency that you gave, repeatedly.

306
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:25,140
Don't do that unless it
is endangering the life.

307
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:33,720
For instance the pneumonia child
when it was given Tuberculinum.

308
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:39,290
You give Tuberculinum,
next day you have pneumonia.

309
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:46,180
You don't have symptoms, there
you can repeat frequently the Tub and

310
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:59,960
by that they get over the acute. It is
very interesting in this group also that

311
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:04,740
 when they bring you the child, the child
is restless, they complain about being

312
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:10,560
hyperactive, it's a good
child, clever child etc.

313
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:18,760
Then you give Veratrum album and after
that for 3 years you see the child is battling

314
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:28,630
with all kinds of acutes, epidemics etc.
And you have to treat every time correctly.

315
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:40,280
You will say why don't you give one remedy
 here and one remedy here and it's gone.

316
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:47,000
It's not like this. Because once it's gone
on these levels you will need a series of

317
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:56,600
remedies before you can really cure,
to bring balance in an unbalanced child

318
00:47:56,650 --> 00:48:03,200
 which has deep behavioral
problems, it is not easy.

319
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:18,840
-I have two questions. The one is if a disease from the 3rd group gets more acutes,

320
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,650
 then it is a good sign?

321
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:29,680
-If a case which does not have for the
last year acutes, starts having acutes,

322
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:32,250
yes it is a good sign.

323
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:44,590
-The other is, I have a case of a woman
 of 60 years old and since 4 years

324
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:53,920
is very weak and her legs
and back are very heavy.

325
00:48:54,380 --> 00:49:17,160
She has a feeling of weight and they had
made the MRI and they saw some lesions

326
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:27,650
in the brain but not inflammatory signs
and all they said she has multiple sclerosis

327
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:46,810
without any signs in the spine. She gets
 frequent colds; so in which group?

328
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,890
-Does she take colds which
are severe or mild?

329
00:49:52,250 --> 00:50:00,910
-In case you treat this, most probably
she gets some acutes.

330
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:08,250
You treat this case and you treat with the
 correct remedy, that woman will develop

331
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:18,880
 a very severe acute like
pneumonia, like meningitis.

332
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:33,810
You get a person that goes slowly
to high blood pressure state,

333
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:38,740
you see less and less acutes.

334
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:57,510
 If they enter diseases like lupus,
you see the acutes are less and less.

335
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:05,080
It is not that they may never have
an acute. They may have an acute

336
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:08,730
but the acutes are usually mild.

337
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:25,330
Here in group 4 if you have
an acute, it is so severe

338
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:34,990
that usually they cannot
survive by themselves;

339
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:41,090
 if the organism reaches a point where
it manages to bring out an acute

340
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:47,280
a very severe acute, they will die.

341
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:53,320
Unless they have a support. Usually
what happens during the acute,

342
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:57,500
they get antibiotics, they get suppressive treatment and they go back

343
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:06,560
to their normal state. Here, where
we have schizophrenics,

344
00:52:07,410 --> 00:52:19,980
for a schizophrenic to get high fever it means either meningitis, meningoencephalitis, pneumonias,

345
00:52:20,090 --> 00:52:29,240
 very severe. During that state of the fever,
you will see they come back to their senses.

346
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:40,360
The schizophrenics start talking normally.
If you manage to treat during that state,

347
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:48,870
you can even save a schizophrenic.
We say, we cannot treat schizophrenia,

348
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:56,120
 it is very difficult but if you have a
 schizophrenic, you give a remedy

349
00:52:56,220 --> 00:53:06,040
and immediately after a while you
see an acute, it's a very good sign.

350
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:13,610
The longer you see the acute,
you have to be treating

351
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:17,180
a case on that level for 3 years
before you see the acute,

352
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:24,660
the further you go here, the
stronger will be the acute.

353
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:33,010
That means if you treat correctly,
the person was here and you treat

354
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:39,320
you raise his level.
You treat, you raise his level.

355
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:45,080
and eventually you bring him here. You
have given 1,2,3,4,5 remedies in 3 years.

356
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:48,780
You bring him here,
he starts with the acutes;

357
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:55,480
 then the acutes are very severe.
Then you need to treat the acutes.

358
00:53:57,010 --> 00:54:06,840
They are very good signs the acute
in this level but you have to be very careful

359
00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:13,650
what remedy you give during these
acutes. That's the whole secret.

360
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:23,270
Here, they are dangerous and you have to be
 on the telephone all the time. How are you?

361
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:50,640
This man with the headaches he developed sinusitis. In order to treat this sinusitis

362
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:58,770
you have to take a case even on the phone
for one hour to be sure about the remedy

363
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:08,840
 you are going to give. Does he need a repetition of Pulsatilla? Does he need Belladonna?

364
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:14,770
This decision is very crucial for the
further development of the case.

365
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:22,040
 I believe that if he had called me and
 have said that I have this symptomatology

366
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,110
 and I had given the correct remedy,
you would see a totally different

367
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:30,040
 picture now on the follow up.

368
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:40,170
But you see the difference between
knowing and not knowing what is going on.

369
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:45,890
When you have also an acute
immediately after the remedy,

370
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:58,860
 it means that your patient was on the
 uppermost level of the third group.

371
00:56:02,830 --> 00:56:10,280
As the reaction is going further and
further from the beginning of the treatment

372
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:20,090
you will have to face the fact
 that this case is going to be

373
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:27,470
more and more difficult,
 it needs more and more treatment.

374
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:35,410
-I have a question to a case of mine.
It was a boy of 4 years with behavioral

375
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:40,630
disturbances and he was
hyperactive and he was born with

376
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:50,880
atresia of the colon (anal atresia).
No connection of the colon and the rectum.

377
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:57,660
 Stool couldn't go through. So they had to operate him immediately after birth.

378
00:56:58,190 --> 00:57:04,870
Then he had a blockage of the lacrymal duct going from the eyes to the nose so his tears

379
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:12,520
were always coming out and he had
an hyperactive esophagus.

380
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:17,080
He would get cramps in the esophagus
with chokings and they had to bring

381
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:24,070
him into hospitals about 3 times per week because he was threatening to choke.

382
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:29,000
He came for homeopathic treatment
and I gave him Tuberculinum.

383
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:34,840
And the tear problem went away
completely, he got much calmer

384
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:40,580
and he had a neurodermatitis on top.
So the tear problem was getting better,

385
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:45,100
 the neurodermatitis was getting better,
 the choking stopped completely

386
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:50,390
he never had to go to hospital and the
parents were pretty content for over a year.

387
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:58,410
Then he developed a
carcinoma, hypernephroma

388
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:14,560
a kidney tumor.  And he had to be operated,

389
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:21,140
it was pretty big already he was passing
blood in his urine and got chemotherapy.

390
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:25,720
Unfortunately I never saw him again
but we have been discussing a lot

391
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:32,060
about how to interpret this and I don't know
 how to interpret this. What would you say?

392
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:36,190
Did I suppress with the homeopathic
 treatment, what was going on?

393
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:43,770
-No, you did not suppress. If the
child had behavioral problems,

394
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:56,570
had genetic disturbances obviously and had different kinds of symptomatology which was

395
00:58:57,020 --> 00:59:04,380
 quite severe and you treat and everything
 goes well and the whole force of the disease

396
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:12,230
stays in one level, this is a case
which belongs to this group.

397
00:59:13,370 --> 00:59:20,800
You give Tuberculinum and he
had that reaction which is good

398
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:29,190
but it might be that you did not find
out the next remedy during this year.

399
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:38,710
There is a year and in a year I believe
they came several times to see you.

400
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:46,150
And this child needed another remedy
 or a third remedy or a fourth remedy

401
00:59:46,430 --> 01:00:00,140
before he could be raised to the point
 where his problem would be externalized

402
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:13,410
and I believe that we see this many times.
The force of the whole disease concentrates

403
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:20,840
in one point and then this is what it
appears as cancer or tumor or whatever.

404
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:31,480
This is not the end of the world, it means
that if you give correct homeopathic

405
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:36,050
treatment, this child can survive.

406
01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:46,520
If the child now takes chemotherapy, most probably returns back the whole situation.

407
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:59,430
Then he will stay as long as he can live that
 child in that condition with all the suffering.

408
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:20,440
The disturbance on the mental-emotional level, as I said, is a diffusion of the disturbance.

409
01:01:20,550 --> 01:01:24,810
Some is on the physical body, some on
the emotional, some on the mental.

410
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:32,080
You cure and this is cleared, mental-emotional
 is cleared and then everything goes to

411
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:37,000
the physical body. The organism
does whatever best can do

412
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:49,730
and says ok, everything I put it in
the heart or the liver, the colon etc.

413
01:01:57,570 --> 01:02:04,640
-I also have a case which I don't know
how to assess it. It is about my nephew.

414
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:10,000
He was born 5 months ago,
he was in a very bad state.

415
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:17,230
He had to receive antibiotics right away
 because he had an amniotic band syndrome.

416
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:23,890
Then he was discharged from the hospital
and 3 weeks later he developed a stenosis

417
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:33,600
of the pylorus and had to be operated on. Afterwards he had problems with drinking and

418
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:38,630
he also showed symptoms that he did not
 like to be looked at and he did not want

419
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:45,730
to be touched. I then gave him Antimonium crudum and the drinking problems which

420
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:55,280
have been very marked got much better.
He could only drink very small amounts and

421
01:02:55,320 --> 01:03:00,810
 always with pains. He was already crying
after 20 ml of the bottle and it took him

422
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:07,190
1 1/2 hours to drink 70 ml and that
at the age of 3 months.

423
01:03:12,550 --> 01:03:21,060
After birth he received Carbo-v, after
this remedy the weakness disappeared

424
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:28,010
and he became much more lively
 and for the vomiting I gave him Aethusa

425
01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:33,440
which helped a lot for the vomiting
 but still on the X-ray you could see

426
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:37,240
that the pylorus
still had a strong stenosis.

427
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:42,780
After I gave him Antimonium crudum,
the drinking problem got much better

428
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:46,870
and he developed
neuro-dermatitis in the face.

429
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:51,760
Then he developed bronchitis for
which he was hospitalized.

430
01:03:51,890 --> 01:03:56,050
But in the hospital he was treated homeopathically and he did not

431
01:03:56,140 --> 01:04:02,240
receive any other medication.
He then was discharged from the hospital.

432
01:04:06,670 --> 01:04:12,790
His drinking problem was 80% better, the breathing problem had improved very well

433
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:21,220
and then I gave him Graphites
for the neuro-dermatitis.

434
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:24,870
After Graphites the drinking problems
ceased completely, he can drink fine now.

435
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:33,570
 Last remaining breathing problems went away and now after 2 weeks of giving Graphites

436
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:44,240
 he is now is developing some problems with mucus in the respiratory area and fever of 38 C.

437
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:50,600
So now I feel insecure what is happening and whether I maybe made a mistake with Graph?

438
01:04:52,020 --> 01:05:00,930
-Most probably there is no mistake
 with the Graph. Graph was correct.

439
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:10,880
Because it ameliorated the
esophagus stenosis and

440
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:17,110
the child can drink much easier. So that
means it has acted on a quite deep level

441
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:28,610
and brings out an acute. The problem is now
 to treat that acute with the correct remedy.

442
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:36,770
-The acute situation now is very mild,
my sister says he is a bit cranky

443
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:40,980
 but otherwise feeling well,
the night was ok, not bad.

444
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:45,490
So I feel at the moment there is
no necessity to treat him at all.

445
01:05:46,770 --> 01:06:00,630
-Yes, that's correct. This is a correct sequence
 of events. You don't have to worry about it.

446
01:06:01,010 --> 01:06:05,900
Anybody else wants to state some of the experience so for the whole class

447
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,320
to listen to examples?

448
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:18,960
-I would like to say some words about
cancer because I have 2 interesting cases.

449
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:28,200
One of them had carcinoma of the posterior nares in the nose which was inoperable

450
01:06:28,490 --> 01:06:34,160
 and he received radiation for that and
the cancer improved through radiation

451
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:42,570
 but afterwards he had massive
problems with his salival glands

452
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:46,900
 and I treated him homeopathically.
Under homeopathic treatment

453
01:06:47,890 --> 01:06:52,520
 the salival problem ameliorated
as well as his emotional state

454
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:58,160
but after a while he then developed a
 melanoma. And I have another case.

455
01:06:58,620 --> 01:07:05,610
He had a melanoma also which was
operated and this man then came to my

456
01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:16,370
 treatment in a very reduced general state.
He had paralytic problems and heart problems

457
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:24,120
I treated him for 3/4 of a year, maybe even
one year and during the treatment

458
01:07:24,220 --> 01:07:29,640
he improved very much but then after
one year he again developed a melanoma

459
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:36,910
 and I would be interested to know
whether I made a mistake in my treatment

460
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:40,470
or whether it can happen that
if you give the correct remedies

461
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:48,740
that this carcinoma situation
does reappear?

462
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:54,150
-If there is a suppressed situation by
allopathic medicine, by radio-therapy,

463
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:57,700
you may have with the correct
treatment, you may have

464
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:15,370
a reappearance of the original focus of the disease. That is something you cannot avoid.

465
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:26,400
The progress of the disease will go backwards and therefore when the melanoma reappears

466
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:33,840
after the heart problems, paralysis etc. that means the organism is in a better state

467
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:43,060
 with the melanoma than with the
heart problems and the paralysis.

468
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:56,250
The organism is not interested to live long,
it is interested to live good.

469
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:19,560
We are interested to live longer and
good yes but in spite of the organism.

470
01:09:21,850 --> 01:09:28,270
You see you say, do anything
so I can live longer.

471
01:09:28,370 --> 01:09:32,430
Take out my heart, put another one.
 Take out my liver, put another liver.

472
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:37,420
Put me in a machine so I can breathe.

473
01:09:41,050 --> 01:09:55,040
 There is somewhere some kind of insanity we are living. Because we have not accepted the

474
01:09:55,140 --> 01:10:07,290
idea of death as a natural phenomenon which is going to happen whether we live 356 days or

475
01:10:07,310 --> 01:10:22,990
whether we live 316 days, it's going to happen. Therefore the human mind trying to avoid the

476
01:10:23,090 --> 01:10:32,210
 death situation, has devised all this kind
of very expensive equipment to prolong

477
01:10:32,290 --> 01:10:40,810
the life for 6, 3, 5 months in spite of the
fact that the person may be living in hell

478
01:10:40,910 --> 01:10:44,660
while he is still here, in heaven.

479
01:10:44,730 --> 01:10:47,460
Because you talk to these
people, they say, 'let me die'.

480
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:54,480
Why the idea of euthanasia came up?
Because so many people are living in

481
01:10:54,580 --> 01:10:59,960
such a state saying 'please take out
all these, I don't want them, I want to die'

482
01:11:00,030 --> 01:11:02,990
and they don't allow them. They are
 in the hospital and tell them

483
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:13,420
 we gonna do whatever is necessary
and keep people alive with the quality of life

484
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:23,850
which is terrible, it is living hell
while we are here on earth.

485
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:37,830
Put injections, put tubes and the poor patient...
 I know this to be true for the

486
01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:47,730
Prime Minister of Greece, Papandreou;
 they kept him alive for 4 months, 5, 6 months

487
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:53,040
they kept him in that condition
and the poor man was saying,

488
01:11:53,140 --> 01:12:08,420
 'please stop pricking me with the injections'.
 We kept him for 6 months more, what for?

489
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:27,320
 In that state. 'We took him out of the hospital'
 and in 20 days, he dies. Is this Medicine?

490
01:12:32,230 --> 01:12:34,760
Homeopathy of course
cannot go against nature.

491
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:46,540
 Homeopathy can only help you if there is possibility on this organism to live so long

492
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:58,100
and to live as best as possible. That's all it can do. It is not possible to keep you in life, alive

493
01:12:58,990 --> 01:13:09,580
in spite of the fact that the organism says, I give up, I have no more energy, I am finished.

494
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:19,470
Sometimes the idea is there, with Homeopathy he will never die. That's nonsense of course.

495
01:13:19,670 --> 01:13:38,070
-I had a terrible thing, he was not my patient,
 he developed cancer of the seminal glands

496
01:13:38,170 --> 01:13:44,980
and after all kinds of treatment
they took away the testes,

497
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:48,940
and from there on started dying,
he never recovered again and he was

498
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:57,670
 in the hospital for 4 weeks in a terrible
situation and they put all kind of things.

499
01:13:57,770 --> 01:14:03,680
He was not my patient, the daughter was
my patient and she was very sad about it.

500
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:10,190
So I said ok, I give you Arsenicum,
you put it under the tongue.

501
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:13,930
They even wanted to transport him
to another hospital the next day.

502
01:14:14,030 --> 01:14:23,400
After 3 hours he slept. The doctor said
he never saw a patient out of such a

503
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:29,460
terrible situation
to die so peacefully.

504
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:40,480
-We can try, we can do whatever is together
with nature. We cannot go against it.

505
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:46,510
That's the main thing that
 you have to understand.

506
01:14:46,610 --> 01:14:52,410
Because expectations from Homeopathy are much more than we can really deliver.

507
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:58,150
And we can say this is the limit.
We cannot go beyond that.

508
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:08,300
Everytime there is such a patient
that says 'I want to do chemotherapy,

509
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:17,130
radiotherapy' and all that. I have
never seen such a case going well.

510
01:15:17,660 --> 01:15:23,470
 I've seen them going fast
down the gutter and finish.

511
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:34,250
But it is the decision and the choice
of the patient, what can we do?

512
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:42,630
We have to know our limits and to explain
to the patient our limits. You have cancer?

513
01:15:42,670 --> 01:15:47,960
I cannot cure you. Who can cure you? If there
 is somebody who can cure you, please go.

514
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:56,430
I cannot cure you. What I can do is maybe
 I can help you in feeling better and better

515
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:04,160
and die in less suffering,
alleviate the suffering.

516
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:09,140
But if the cancer is in the beginning,
I have seen cases,

517
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:14,840
colon cancer to live 20
years with Homeopathy.

518
01:16:15,790 --> 01:16:22,480
 Of course if there is an obstruction
you have to take out the tumor,

519
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:29,520
otherwise you have peritonitis and
you will die from the obstruction.

520
01:16:29,790 --> 01:16:34,680
You take out the obstruction and you don't do chemotherapy, you keep on Homeopathy

521
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:38,400
I have seen living many many years.

522
01:16:43,850 --> 01:16:48,760
-One question for cancer cases. We have often the problem the patient cannot stand for

523
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:55,920
a cancer operation or allopathic treatment and put the question 'shall I have suppression

524
01:16:56,070 --> 01:17:01,880
by operation or not or can you promise
or try to treat cancer with result.

525
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:07,120
What's the advice generally?
It's very dangerous I think.

526
01:17:07,780 --> 01:17:15,880
-When the tumor endangers the life immediately then you have to surgically remove it

527
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:23,280
and follow it up immediately with homeopathic treatment. That is the general statement.

528
01:17:23,830 --> 01:17:33,640
If you go for chemotherapy and radiotherapy
and all together, it is the choice of course

529
01:17:33,670 --> 01:17:41,580
 of the patient but in my experience I have
not seen good results from such treatment.

530
01:17:44,290 --> 01:17:51,200
On the contrary I have seen better
results when tumor is removed

531
01:17:51,270 --> 01:18:00,440
and good Homeopathy follows, I have
seen people living for quite long years.

532
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:17,480
-I have a friend, they found last April
 metastasis in the liver.

533
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:21,160
The liver grew within a
month she felt very bad,

534
01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:29,750
she has always been healthy and
suddenly she felt like she's pregnant

535
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:35,040
she was 42 years she checked
 that she was not pregnant

536
01:18:35,290 --> 01:18:40,850
 and the liver grew and grew. She is a
nurse so she was scared to go and check it.

537
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:45,480
By the time she checked it, the whole
 liver was full of metastasis.

538
01:18:45,990 --> 01:18:51,090
I took the case, I was afraid to do anything
so I sent her to Vega in United States

539
01:18:51,410 --> 01:18:58,300
and he treated her with Kali-ars.
At the beginning with 9C every day,

540
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:09,840
during this period she did the check-up,
they were thinking that it came

541
01:19:09,940 --> 01:19:18,670
came from cervical cancer
but they were not sure.

542
01:19:18,740 --> 01:19:23,430
Anyway they gave her 3
sessions of chemotherapy,

543
01:19:23,990 --> 01:19:31,800
she was afraid not to do it, she was hysterical and during this time, after the second CT,

544
01:19:32,020 --> 01:19:38,870
nothing was there. The metastasis
wasn't there, the cancer wasn't there,

545
01:19:38,970 --> 01:19:43,910
they were thinking that maybe
it was not there originally.

546
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:53,080
They gave her the third one and then it was
a miracle and they wanted to check better.

547
01:19:53,450 --> 01:19:58,700
 So they opened the stomach and looked
inside. And then they said maybe there is a

548
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:03,630
little spot still on the liver and they
wanted it to cut it off but they didn't and

549
01:20:03,730 --> 01:20:10,640
we will give you therapy directly to the
liver, not involving the whole body.

550
01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:16,230
 So far she had this treatment.
But all the time she is with Homeopathy

551
01:20:16,330 --> 01:20:20,370
 and when she has treatment she
is much higher, a few times the day.

552
01:20:20,470 --> 01:20:27,000
She is already on 100 or 200 C every day

553
01:20:27,940 --> 01:20:33,960
 and so far even the blood test
that they check, is clean
