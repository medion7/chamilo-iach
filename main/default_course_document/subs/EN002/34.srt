1
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:40,360
What I wanted to discuss with you today
is an issue which I think is very important.

2
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:49,560
I think it is one of the issues that has made
me, has given me the possibility

3
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:56,020
to prescribe correctly in many cases.

4
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:08,300
It is very important issue but at the
same time is not very clear.

5
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:23,450
That issue is the issue of underlining. How we underline, why we underline a symptom.

6
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:39,240
Every symptom has a particular meaning
 for the patient and for the doctor.

7
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:55,130
The meaning of a symptom is not always the
same between the patient and the doctor

8
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:02,350
and that has to be stressed from the beginning.

9
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:22,650
If the patient says a symptom with intensity
 and clearness and it is self-produced,

10
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:34,770
spontaneous, then it is important.

11
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:55,670
Such a symptom we underline 3 times.
But many times I have seen a paper case

12
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:10,930
where we have this underlining and these underlinings are useless. What is missing?

13
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:29,490
So we said spontaneous, intense and clear.

14
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:40,640
If somebody says, I have a very strong headache. We get this description many times

15
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:49,620
in headache cases. The headache is
terribly strong and I have to take pain

16
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:55,220
killers and things like that.

17
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:04,260
And you try to get a description of the
headache and the description is not clear;

18
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:23,160
 that symptom already takes second rate.
It is not an important symptom for you.

19
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:38,160
When it comes? It's so great. You ask,
when it comes and they say, it's so intense.

20
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:46,880
That means the information is not there. Therefore that information which is not clear,

21
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:56,330
though it is intense, though it is spontaneous,
 is useless. Because all remedies have the

22
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:03,020
possibility to have headaches.

23
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:13,170
So, a spontaneous and intense
symptom has to be clear as well.

24
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:28,200
And if the main symptoms of the
patient are not clear, our experience

25
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:36,910
is that such cases are very difficult to treat
 and most probably you will not be able to

26
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,900
find the indicated remedy, ever.

27
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:48,370
They will stay with their headaches the rest of their lives and you will be able to change

28
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:58,600
a little bit the intensity or the
location or things like that.

29
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:09,720
So in the underlining in which you do and
which corresponds to the underlining of the

30
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:17,540
Repertory and the Materia Medica, bold letters, italics, ordinary, there is a correspondence.

31
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:28,020
Bold letters very strong, you have to find a corresponding of this symptom of the patient

32
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:36,570
 with the corresponding intensity
in the Repertory.

33
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:46,480
You understand this?
Do you all have the Repertory?

34
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:12,610
In the old times many Homeopaths thought
 that they could work without a Repertory.

35
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:18,520
If you know the Materia Medica that
George has in his head, that's enough.

36
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:25,670
 No, that's not true. I look at
the Repertory every time.

37
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:36,040
I have to look at least a few times and if one is basing his prescriptions only on the Materia

38
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:44,910
Medica which he has in his head
he is going to miss most of the cases.

39
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:54,230
So this work is very important
and it's the crux of the matter.

40
00:07:54,470 --> 00:08:00,000
Whether you're going to find the
remedy or not it will depend

41
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:05,480
on whether you will pay special attention to certain symptoms.

42
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:25,610
This is, as an idea, where you pay most attention. This is the idea behind.

43
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:37,600
I give you a project. You take each other's case and you numerate symptoms, 25-30 symptoms.

44
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:52,320
I got 30 symptoms from the patient, I'm good, no. Because these symptoms are not evaluated so

45
00:08:52,420 --> 00:09:00,160
they can become 3 dimensional,
 they can become alive.

46
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:14,720
 Symptoms which areflat, it's like a picture. You see a picture of a person on a piece of paper.

47
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:27,180
Once you put emphasis into different symptoms, then it becomes alive, the picture becomes alive.

48
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:41,970
In homeopathic prescribing this is absolutely necessary to do. You cannot give a case on a

49
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:52,280
paper and in this case there are only written
symptoms unless you have given an evaluation

50
00:09:52,380 --> 00:10:02,920
<i>your</i> evaluation. Now, the evaluation is something very subjective, right?

51
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:13,130
I see it this way, he sees it that way.
That is the problem, where the problem

52
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:24,360
starts with the underlining.
Then you will see it when we take a case and

53
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:32,780
 I ask you, how much you underline that symptom. You say 1 time, 2 times, 3 times.

54
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:40,960
In some cases the whole class or the
majority will say 3 times, it's ok.

55
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:52,020
But never everybody perceives the
 symptom in the same way.

56
00:10:52,120 --> 00:11:05,660
So there is a subjective element into underlining a symptom and when it is pathology, it is clear

57
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:13,140
for everyone, how much you underline headaches in this case?

58
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:22,130
3 times, it was very intense. But
headaches which have no clear

59
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:28,850
description, either you underline
it 3 or 2 or 1time,

60
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:35,380
you may even take the symptom
and throw it out of the evaluation.

61
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:45,190
A symptom which is very strong you can
take it and throw it out. Why?

62
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:57,330
Because, no modalities, no peculiarities.

63
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:15,400
Find in the Organon where Hahnemann talks about this subject. The subject of taking into consideration.

64
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:24,880
You take into consideration only the peculiar symptoms and the other paragraph in which he

65
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:34,040
 says, even an intense symptom is of no value.

66
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:41,960
By the end of the seminar you will
know by heart, Organon.

67
00:12:56,570 --> 00:13:06,640
I do not say things of my own.

68
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:20,400
For a period of time I thought I was telling
 things of my own.

69
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:29,930
When I re-read the Organon, 30 years later,
 I found out that Hahnemann

70
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:38,530
had noted down almost everything which
I thought I discovered or it was important

71
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:45,330
 in the homeopathic practice.

72
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:53,530
It's very strange. People are saying, what is
this symptom, totality and you hear totality,

73
00:13:53,680 --> 00:14:02,240
you read totality and then you come to the
point, the realization that it is not totality.

74
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:15,720
Sometimes it is yes. But most of the
 time is not totality, it is peculiarity.

75
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:24,630
Perceive what is individual in the case,
 perceive what is peculiar in the case.

76
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:57,200
In Homeopathy you take a case
and you struggle taking the case.

77
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:13,360
Unless you reach a point where you have
taken enough information that is reliable

78
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:26,180
 well-underlined,which is peculiar and which is clear, you will not be able to have the remedy.

79
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:39,920
I give you a gross example,
 it comes from my experience of yesterday.

80
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:58,240
I was looking at a case and the case was going for Silica because of constipation and chilliness.

81
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:18,240
Then it went towards Sepia because of the leuchorrea and constipation and chilliness.

82
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:35,960
And then the bloatedness came, chilliness, constipation, bloatedness: Lycopodium, eh?

83
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:53,430
And then came the symptom, better in the sea. My life is the sea, I can eat in the sea,

84
00:16:53,530 --> 00:17:03,800
rejuvenate, so powerful, so strong that symptom.
If you ignore it, and they had ignored it the

85
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:12,040
 previous Homeopaths who were giving remedies, if you ignore that which is clear,

86
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:22,450
spontaneous, intense and peculiar, then the other fit, constipation, yes Med. can have

87
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:31,200
constipation, leuchorrea, Med can have leucorrhoea, chilliness etc.

88
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:48,240
But many times, and this is the problem and this is a written question of the student who wrote to

89
00:17:48,420 --> 00:18:00,160
 me, something very important. He said,
dear Sir I have not understood how can

90
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:23,370
we recognize what we call the uppermost
layer? And this is a big question, not easy.

91
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:35,360
The picture will be like this; some symptoms of the third layer maybe coming up, as you know.

92
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,220
How do you recognize this?

93
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:50,850
This answer you have to couple it with this information to be able to perceive

94
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:59,730
what is most important in the first layer.

95
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:11,290
The same example I gave you, Sil.,
Sep., Med., I will give it to you

96
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:24,690
in another way,
in another context.

97
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:40,370
Chilliness quite strong, underline it 2 times. Constipation quite strong, underline it 2 times.

98
00:19:40,470 --> 00:20:03,240
Brittle nails, underline it 1 time.
Leucorrhea, what kind? yellowish-white.

99
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:21,520
 Underline it 3 times. Better in the sea, your
 mind went to Medorrhinum and he says:

100
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:37,540
I feel fantastic in the sea' and then you
pursue this matter. 'Exactly how you feel?'

101
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:45,160
'Do you feel better?'. And the patient understands
that this information is important

102
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:56,890
 and as you talk she comes out with the information that she used to be much better.

103
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:10,350
'I used to go crazy about this, not so much anymore'. Here, you have a different evaluation.

104
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:31,940
Let us say, here this blue is better in the sea. This symptom pops up on the uppermost layer,

105
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:43,690
as well, but when you take out the two other layers, you will see that this symptom

106
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,450
 on the third layer is very strong.

107
00:21:49,670 --> 00:22:02,080
So a symptom that was there strong and now
it is not so strong, it indicates, it's an indication

108
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:13,560
 for a lower level which now has been
overcome by another remedy.

109
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:23,520
So you have to be aware all the time
what is the information that I have to evaluate.

110
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:35,160
Don't just rush to make a prescription.
Medorrhinum! Not this time.

111
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:43,680
 Medorrhinum in order to be prescribed this symptom here has to be the better in the sea.

112
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:51,430
The most prominent of the symptoms.
It's not the symptom in the way we say it is

113
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:59,680
pathology but for us that we know the Materia Medica, it is very important symptom

114
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:08,300
and here comes the idea, how can we
 recognize the symptoms?

115
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:13,120
The symptoms we can recognize
only if we know Materia Medica.

116
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:22,540
That means, a peculiar symptom,
 it is not a peculiar idea.

117
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:29,640
It has to be recorded in the Materia Medica
 and in the Repertory to be useful to us.

118
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:36,260
A peculiar symptom which has never been recorded in the Materia Medica

119
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:42,240
or in the Repertory is useless.

120
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:50,140
 You can record it or you can say
that peculiar symptom was cured

121
00:23:50,340 --> 00:24:00,140
by that remedy and from that onward we may have some information. But it is not useful for us.

122
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:24,210
You think you know all that but this
information is not simply information,

123
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:36,880
it is <i>experience</i> together with information.
Because as we learn the Materia Medica,

124
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:42,860
 we know the important things on the Materia Medica or the peculiarities of each remedy,

125
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:53,390
and then we hear and some of the symptoms strike us as peculiar in that case

126
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:57,860
and we say which remedy has that?

127
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:03,720
That is important to search in the
Repertory, to search in the computer,

128
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:11,940
to search in the Materia Medica to find out.

129
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:32,200
Because the peculiarity may be said
by the patient in a passing way.

130
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:43,640
Because what he is concerned about is his headaches, his abdomen,

131
00:25:43,740 --> 00:26:06,800
his colitis, his stomach pain. He is not concerned that by 11 o'clock he has an empty stomach

132
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:16,570
 every day and has to eat something.
He doesn't even know he has it.

133
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:27,450
He will not spontaneously give it to you.
It will not be intense.

134
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:37,920
It will be clear, that means you will describe it exactly and he will down play it.

135
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:46,230
He will say,
 'I also have it, what's there?'

136
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:56,040
But for you that you have symptoms of Sulphur already appearing, that is gold.

137
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:00,540
That symptom makes a prescription for Sulphur.

138
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,740
Because we know that 11 o'clock Sulphur
 cases have an empty feeling and

139
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,270
 they have to eat something.

140
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:22,910
Otherwise they will feel nauseated. Sometimes this symptom is a pre-runner of possible

141
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:34,200
ulcer and when it comes to the second stage
this emptiness becomes nausea and

142
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:45,120
they have to spit. They will say:
'every morning I have nausea'

143
00:27:45,570 --> 00:28:01,340
and there is a word in Greek 'ligoura'
I don't know it in English.

144
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:16,040
It's an emptiness together with nausea, it's not clear nausea. They suffer quite a lot.

145
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:34,210
They may have also come because they have
cervical syndrome or periarthritis or whatever.

146
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:42,920
 And with this symptom immediately
your mind goes to Sulphur.

147
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:01,050
As you progress now you become more experienced; I will give you some tricks.

148
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:11,420
For those who have listened to me during analysis of cases, in Celle

149
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:19,140
here and there and I come out in the class
and then I make the analysis.

150
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:29,080
What I usually do is when a patient says something like this, I don't investigate it too much

151
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:37,270
So the students will not understand that
I pay speciaI attention to that.

152
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:44,760
and most of the students lose the point.

153
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:50,840
What is the difference between me
paying special attention?

154
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:59,270
He said something, I noted down,
I passed it and let it be as the patient said it.

155
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:05,240
I went to the class, we analyzed the case, nobody mentions that symptom.

156
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:11,640
 There is another symptom,
usually I ask the class,

157
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:17,040
I pressurize you and it has gone out
of your mind, the whole class

158
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:21,310
has not noticed that important symptom.

159
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:30,820
You see how important it is to connect the information from the patient to the information

160
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:38,930
of the Materia Medica or the Repertory.
Because unless you know that such a thing

161
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:46,360
 exists in the Materia Medica, you cannot go and say that this may be an important symptom.

162
00:30:52,810 --> 00:31:07,640
So going back in this case here,
the first is Arnica.

163
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:22,560
You may have a case which has Arnica first,
then Sepia, then Medorrhinum.

164
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:27,100
Some symptoms of Sepia maybe
appear here and there

165
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,020
and some symptoms of Medorrhinum also.

166
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:48,070
But what you are looking for is to make a picture of a remedy out of the most important symptoms.

167
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:57,130
Don't take this, don't take that. The most important symptoms.

168
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:10,150
and what is very interesting is to evaluate the symptoms which are most recent.

169
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:23,610
The symptoms which are the most recent and
more strong lately, this is the secret.

170
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:32,140
How can you find out what is the
uppermost layer?

171
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:38,880
You can not imagine how many times I have seen cases which have been treated by

172
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:43,960
Homeopathy and they cannot
spot the first remedy.

173
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:56,360
They spot the second, they spot the third
and you lose the first remedy.

174
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:04,480
You lose Natrum Muriaticum for instance.
This is the first remedy not Arnica. Why?

175
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:12,040
 Because it has gone through a lot of grief.
And you have to take out that before

176
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:27,950
Sepia can act. But then in such cases you
cannot imagine how the main symptom

177
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:36,070
will appear that has not changed after
Nat-m (the headache).

178
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:44,330
Yet the headache will have slight
changes that will point out to Sepia.

179
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:58,050
The headache was more generalized,
has gone now more on the left side,

180
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:12,180
already is a Sepia sign, over the left eye.
Already you have confirmed Sepia

181
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:21,800
The patient says: 'I am the same'. His headache is the same or appears to be the same.

182
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:34,780
Actually in reality it has changed dramatically because of these changes on the mental-

183
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:47,990
emotional picture which is not so much Natrum Muriaticum anymore and has gone to Sepia.

184
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:09,840
You see a child that he has easy vomiting and has pains here and there like rheumatic pains

185
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:22,450
and you go to the mental picture and you see that that child is really lacking self confidence.

186
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:32,660
And the lacking of self confidence is strong,
what are you going to treat the nausea ?

187
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:37,930
Are you going to treat the Rhus-t
symptoms there are there?

188
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:48,770
No, you are going to treat this insecurity of the child first and let the nausea be much more

189
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:57,210
 let the pains be much more but the self confidence will increase and then the

190
00:35:57,310 --> 00:36:04,360
physical symptomatology will pop up.
And then you treat this symptomatology.

191
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:16,160
If you go straight...the mother says,
'the child is vomiting!' yes, but this is important.

192
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:35,240
What is prominent? A child who is Bar-c child,
let us say and is insecure and cannot learn

193
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:42,700
and cannot stand up and say her
opinion in front of others etc.

194
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:56,780
That child will remain in that range, that
means it will not become very self-confident

195
00:36:56,930 --> 00:37:08,450
child, that is another personality.
Here in Bar-c we have to correct

196
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:17,900
in mental-emotional picture what is pathological
upon the personality. The personality of this

197
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:31,150
 child is to be shy, it's a very shy child.
 It may remain a shy child the rest of her life.

198
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:42,970
But the pathology is that she has absolutely no courage to get up and speak in the class and

199
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:52,680
say her lesson. The moment the teacher
 asks a Baryta carbonica and says, tell us about

200
00:37:53,340 --> 00:38:02,140
 a history question, she looks like this,
terrified, searches.

201
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:28,040
She will answer but she will remain as a personality not like somebody who is extrovert.

202
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:38,200
And then what you will see later on,
for Rhus-t, you will see again a shy person,

203
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:53,940
 a person who is not very forward but the symptoms of Rhus Tox now being exaggerated

204
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:58,720
a little bit, point out the next remedy.

205
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:13,760
All these theoretical aspects we have to see them in practice, to see them in cases.

206
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:21,570
I see some panic in some eyes, I understand.

207
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:32,080
How are we going to do all this? Not me.
I can not understand. I can perceive this.

208
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:47,730
This is something which can be learned. It is not so subjective as it might look at this moment.

209
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:59,850
It can be learned and you will be able to
 perceive especially with the knowledge
of the Materia Medica.

210
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:07,720
With the Materia Medica we try to spot the personality of the pathology of the remedy.

211
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:19,260
We spot what are the 3-4 points that we need
for that remedy. So as you learn the Materia

212
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:28,440
 Medica and you are looking at a case.
 It was a beautiful case in previous seminar.

213
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:45,650
I taught a Nux Moschata. Some doctor has brought the case and she is using the same

214
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:52,120
expressions like the ones we have used in the class. Absolutely the same expression.

215
00:40:52,220 --> 00:41:04,080
 You see she comes back and the whole
class sees this is a Nux Moschata case.
How this happens?

216
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:15,680
I don't know by synchronization. It's very improbable that you may get such a remedy in

217
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:27,930
the same so the students one day are taught here and the next day are taught by the patient.

218
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:37,960
And then the patient was concerned with her headaches but she was describing the

219
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:51,040
mental state of Nux-m and then all the students said, forget about the headaches.That is obvious.

220
00:41:56,770 --> 00:42:03,660
-To this last case I have difficulties because you said, take this Baryta Carbonica child and

221
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:13,240
it develops reumatism and nausea and just recently, do I still take the Bar-c state first

222
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:22,070
  if it is acute rheumatism which goes
to Rhus-t do I still give Bar-c first?

223
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:38,840
-Yes, very good question. Magrit asks
these are acute symptoms of whatever.

224
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:45,450
Are you going to take the mental state
more important than the acute?

225
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:56,780
I did not say exactly that. You see what
I described is a child who comes for nausea

226
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,640
and the mother is concerned,
she gives you all that,

227
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:08,600
but at the same time she gives you
a picture of Baryta Carbonica.

228
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:18,720
Now you will notice that this acute
state is not so acute, it' s not

229
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:28,880
so bothering really. Maybe later on they will become bothering but the mother is concerned.

230
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:44,680
'She has this pain here', she tries to find symptms which are not important which are
 not the really strong symptoms.

231
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:56,170
 If the child comes with an acute rheumatism, you don't go to prescribe directly

232
00:43:56,270 --> 00:44:04,600
unless it fits with the picture of the case.
You take into consideration the fact that the

233
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:13,160
 child has been having an accident and she
has developed some symptoms of Arnica

234
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:21,010
and that will be the first. And this is the difficulty of course, when this and when that?

235
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:33,810
That is the problem really. Otherwise, it would be easy.  You are dealing with something alive.

236
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:43,920
 The organism is something alive. You cannot
put them in boxes and say that box, no.

237
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:56,210
 You have to deal in each case with such an understanding; the organism is acting all the time

238
00:44:56,310 --> 00:45:05,740
An organism maybe one day has Phos symptoms and the next day has Sep symptoms.

239
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:16,180
 And then it goes like this. Up and
down and changing all the time.

240
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:21,120
And then you take this case and you say,
neither Phos nor Sep,

241
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:28,210
changing symptoms all the time is Pulsatilla.

242
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:36,610
Many times after a remedy, you give a remedy and after the remedy because of the reaction

243
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:47,510
of the remedy, develops a picture
of a second remedy.

244
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:57,080
Don't go and give it. You gave a remedy
and the next day it looks like Sepia

245
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:05,380
or looks like Phosphorus, a lot of discharge
from the vagina or some nose bleeding.

246
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:16,320
Nose bleeding and thirst, next day. No, wait until it settles and if nose bleeding continues for one

247
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:24,920
month, two months,t hree months, that is the time when the picture of Phos. has come up.

248
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:35,600
The problem with today's diseases is that they are much more complicated than what

249
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:42,320
 they were treating, Hahnemann, Kent
and all these big masters.

250
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:50,870
We are faced with a much more complicated
situation here because of vaccination,

251
00:46:50,970 --> 00:47:00,200
 chemical drugs, pollution, stress.
The pictures has changed totally.

252
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:10,140
And therefore we have more and more what Hahnemann called 'one sided diseases'.

253
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:22,450
We are talking here about what Hahnemann talks in one sided diseases.

254
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:53,550
This idea of underlining. I brought into the
 picture but if you take and you read carefully

255
00:47:55,750 --> 00:48:01,720
the writings of Hahnemann you
will see this idea coming through.

256
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:12,660
The idea of Repertorisation was always necessary because from the very beginning

257
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:21,900
the Materia Medicas and the Repertories
were evaluated in at least 3 grades.

258
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:40,630
So there is a need for us to go accordingly
and if a remedy has a symptom which

259
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:47,800
is even general symptom but which
is spontaneous, intense and clear,

260
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:55,080
it may itself give you the
direction of the remedy.

261
00:48:56,450 --> 00:49:06,400
If I describe to you, she comes with headaches and it is mostly on the right side

262
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:24,640
and it is maddening, very strong headaches
 and it is throbbing and the window is closed,

263
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:33,240
 and she has to lie down, what you would
 say is the remedy?

264
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:52,880
If I say there is a right side of headache,
 it comes here and goes up to there

265
00:49:53,480 --> 00:50:04,640
and when it's very intense she has
 to vomit, what's the remedy?

266
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:24,720
This is one symptom, let's describe: severe headache, right side extended to right

267
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:37,580
occipital protuberance. Then second she says: when this headache is strong I have to vomit,

268
00:50:38,260 --> 00:51:01,860
 It is a matter only of knowing Materia Medica.
 If this is strong, it doesn't matter now all

269
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:05,940
the other details. It's a case of Sanguinaria.

270
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:19,820
 Right side, extending to right occiput,
 nausea and vomiting: Sanguinaria.

271
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,660
You give Sanguinaria, forget all others.
Only on this symptom.

272
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:43,270
You get the other, right sided, very severe, throbbing with a pulsation he has to lie down,

273
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:49,800
cannot move, that is Belladonna.

274
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:57,840
You can not confuse this because it's clear
the description of Sanguinaria here and

275
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:03,160
it's clear the description of Belladonna
on the other hand.

276
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:16,270
You are not allowed, later on, to confuse this information because

277
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:21,920
it has been described very clearly
in the books and the person

278
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:28,220
describes it exactly in the way
 that the provers have felt it.

279
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:38,680
That is Belladonna and that is Sanguinaria.

280
00:52:41,890 --> 00:53:02,180
Now, in Belladonna case if I had said to you
that it's worse from jar; you lie down in bed and

281
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:08,560
somebody comes and sits in the bed
and you shout, Belladonna.

282
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:17,920
In Sanguinaria it does not matter. Then it becomes more clear for Belladonna.

283
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:29,660
 Both they have photophobia.
Both they need to close the windows, dark.

284
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:40,390
 With strong headaches most of the patients have photophobia and they require the

285
00:53:40,610 --> 00:53:49,960
curtains down. That is not characteristic. The characteristic is the location and the throbbing.

286
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:57,580
Location and throbbing: the first
remedy is Belladonna.

287
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:03,790
Then you ask one question: 'how do you feel if somebody just jerks you a little bit?'

288
00:54:03,890 --> 00:54:08,860
'Forget it, I can't stand it!'

289
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:35,640
You're supposed to understand what we're talking about and if you don't then you have

290
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:45,410
to ask questions to make it clear. Because maybe I omit certain things which I consider as

291
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:51,780
self understanding. So by your questions,
I can complete the picture, right?

292
00:54:51,880 --> 00:55:01,390
Don't pretend everyone in here, he's an expert.

293
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:09,840
-You said before that you have to find a coorelation between the intensity of the

294
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:19,990
 symptom of the patient and the importance
 of the remedy in the Repertory.

295
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:32,620
Does that mean that I have to find a
rubric on the Repertory where the remedy

296
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:40,170
has to appear in the same degree
in which the patient desribes it?

297
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:53,190
-Yes, correct. That's correct. If the patient describes a symptom on the third degree,

298
00:55:53,290 --> 00:55:57,690
you must find it in the Repertory
on the third degree.

299
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:11,210
 But this is not always but most of the times.

300
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:25,780
-I wanted to just ask this question
because I went over all last year's notes,

301
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:29,300
I read again the notes from last time and mr.Currim -the specialist for Repertory-

302
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:45,770
said that the degree of the symptoms, the evaluation of the symptoms has nothing to do

303
00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:49,640
with the degree of the symptoms
in the Repertory.

304
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:05,200
-That makes no sense. The degree
of the symptoms of the patient

305
00:57:07,110 --> 00:57:12,400
is not the one that is going into the Repertory.

306
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:20,100
Most probably he said something else, yes?

307
00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:33,280
-He said, it has nothing to do with the intensity
of the symptoms but only with the frequency in

308
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:38,280
which the symptoms appeared and the proving.

309
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:50,990
-Wait a moment. When a remedy has
been recorded in the Repertory,

310
00:57:51,090 --> 00:57:56,240
 it has been recorded in the third degree, why?

311
00:57:56,470 --> 00:58:03,720
For several reasons, it's not one reason that it was frequent, no.

312
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:19,110
The first reason is frequency, the second
reason is clear, the third reason is intensity

313
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:29,050
 and the fourth reason is that
it was found clinical verification.

314
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:38,610
So the degrees in the Repertory depict frequency, clearness, intensity and clinical

315
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:49,460
verification. So the Repertories are made out,
in their degrees, out of these parameters.

316
00:58:50,920 --> 00:59:02,290
 Of course, the original, the very original
proving will say, frequency, what happens?

317
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:13,810
We have a class of 50 people. We give Bell. and 10 of them develop right sided headache.

318
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:21,210
That is very frequent in all the provers.
That is strong already.

319
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:33,580
But the clinical verification shows that the headaches of Bell., are really very strong.

320
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:38,080
And you have to have headaches which
are on the third degree intensity.

321
00:59:38,180 --> 00:59:46,360
And the throbbing nature is very clear.

322
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:55,060
That is why it is not only frequency.
It does not mean anything.

323
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:03,640
It means that this remedy has that
symptom quite strongly in its pathology.

324
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:13,140
That person has that symptom quite strongly in his pathology, then match it.

325
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:32,590
This is an understanding which he has maybe.

326
01:00:32,810 --> 01:00:42,450
I'm not sure, I have to go and look on the video and I'll see under what context he had said it.

327
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:59,810
-Currim also stressed that we also should pay attention on the first degree in the Repertory.

328
01:00:59,910 --> 01:01:06,250
 He did not mention that there is no importance
between the degree of the Repertory and the

329
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:16,280
 degree of the symptoms of the patient. But you also mustn't forget the one degree symptoms.

330
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:25,050
-Sure, you must not forget. The one degree symptoms is something relevant of course.

331
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:34,670
Because if you have a small remedy and in this small remedy, you have recorded that symptom

332
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:41,050
It is most probable that you have seen
it in that small remedy very few times.

333
01:01:41,430 --> 01:01:47,790
So the remedy has not been
raised to the third degree.

334
01:01:53,210 --> 01:02:01,610
-It was in connection with a child who
has his face covered with warts

335
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:06,280
and Lyc only appeared on the first degree.

336
01:02:07,830 --> 01:02:14,990
-You give Lyc. why?
Because it was his face with warts, no.

337
01:02:15,090 --> 01:02:23,940
Because the child has another symptom of Lyc which was pointed out that this is a case of Lyc

338
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:27,760
 and not of Thuja and not Medorrhinum.

339
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:39,780
I have exactly the same case with a child
whose whole face was covered with warts.

340
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:53,370
 It was ready to be operated, it was terrible.
The case was cleared with Calcarea Carbonica.

341
01:02:54,040 --> 01:03:04,560
It doesn't mean anything just saying an information like this apart from a context.

342
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:15,380
The thing is when in a case you have certain symptoms of Calc, are you going and on

343
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:20,330
 the pathology you just prescribe Thuja?
Of course not.

344
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:26,720
You need other supportive symptoms. So if
these supportive symptoms point out clearly

345
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:34,560
to Lyc give Lyc, give Chel, give anything,
which may never had that particular symptom.

346
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:41,330
-The other symptoms of this child was
dictatorial to his little brothers

347
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:46,320
and desire for sweets and flatus.

348
01:03:52,310 --> 01:04:05,710
-And when you go to warts on the face you
 don't even see Calc. It doesn't matter.

349
01:04:05,810 --> 01:04:14,880
I didn't care whether it was there that pathology or not, the moment that the child is a Calc child.

350
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:23,760
-But what was important in this
case we mention was that this symptom

351
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:30,140
in a low degree led
them to the right remedy.

352
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:38,460
And I think that is what you wanted
to stress that sometimes a remedy

353
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:42,810
on a very low degree may
lead you on the right way.

354
01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:53,060
-I'm not sure because if the remedy was prescribed on dictatorial, on desire sweets etc.

355
01:04:53,160 --> 01:05:00,880
that means he took this whole picture
he saw Lyc and he saw also that Lyc

356
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:05,680
  has warts in the face but not frequently.

357
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:16,110
How many times you have seen warts in
the face and you give Lycopodium, ok.

358
01:05:16,210 --> 01:05:20,800
So therefore it is there. It is recorded.

359
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:26,210
Sometimes it is not recorded at all. The pathology may not be recorded in the

360
01:05:26,310 --> 01:05:31,640
Materia Medica but when you
have symptoms of Calc

361
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:36,910
symptoms of Sep and the pathology
 is not Sep, it still does not matter.

362
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:46,360
I have given Sepia in a case when the
vagina was dry. No discharge at all.

363
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:55,130
On the contrary it says, dryness.
I said yes, it doesn't matter, Sepia.

364
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:03,240
You see I don't necessarily have to
have the leucorrhea of Sepia

365
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:08,330
if the other symptoms are Sepia.

366
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:31,330
-Who is smoking in this class?

367
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:50,150
-You see with the Italian group,
the real smokers if I go over an hour

368
01:06:50,250 --> 01:07:00,640
they go and sit outside to listen.
I see nobody does it here.

369
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:08,960
-Of the things you mentioned last lesson, to me the most complicated appears this question of

370
01:07:09,060 --> 01:07:23,600
when to change remedy if you can see several layers. To me it seems especially complicated

371
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:32,020
 when there is a nosode. A lot of Homeopaths say if a nosode appears picture in the

372
01:07:32,150 --> 01:07:42,330
symptomatology you have to give it first but
with your Med. example this is not always true.

373
01:07:42,430 --> 01:07:50,560
Are there some rules for this?

374
01:07:51,560 --> 01:08:01,040
In my experience I have not been able to find rules like give first Sulphur to clear up the case.

375
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:12,430
Give first Nux-v to do what's called in French, they call it 'drainage' Nux-v and some remedies.

376
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:26,880
Give other things, nosodes or the big ones:
Syphilinum, Medorrhinum.

377
01:08:27,430 --> 01:08:38,120
I would be afraid to do that not only because
 it may not affect the case at all.

378
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:43,470
But because it may affect the case on the wrong way. I mean change the case,

379
01:08:43,570 --> 01:08:49,230
change the symptomatology. Because in
this case you give Medorrhinum first

380
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:57,360
it may have some effect but the effect will
be to confuse the case, not to cure it.

381
01:09:02,950 --> 01:09:10,660
So there are no rules. The rule is what
you have as symptomatology at the moment.

382
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:17,080
The organism brings out certain
symptoms and they are speaking to you.

383
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:19,440
Saying: I suffer from this, this and that.

384
01:09:19,540 --> 01:09:26,230
Then you take that information and
then you evaluate it properly

385
01:09:26,330 --> 01:09:33,840
and then you give the remedy.
It doesn't matter what it might be.

386
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:49,010
-This thing with underlining and the bold letters
is very disturbed in the heads of the people

387
01:09:49,110 --> 01:09:57,940
and I think it is a fault of Mr.Currim
because what he really said was

388
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:06,130
the intensity of the symptoms do not relate with the grade in the Repertory. This is what he said.

389
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:14,860
He says that Kent said this in his lectures
22 and 23 and Schmidt said that the grade

390
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:20,360
has something to do with the intensity. So would you explain it to the people again please?

391
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:28,400
-Ok, this is very simple. When they start
making the proving of a remedy...

392
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:34,400
Ok, out of a 100 people, 20 had
that symptom, that was frequent.

393
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:43,000
Frequently appeared that symptom. The idea was that if we had a repeated symptom,

394
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:55,140
then we put it in bold type. in the beginning.
In the beginning it was God, you know.

395
01:11:01,210 --> 01:11:04,400
 Later on we have developed Repertory
and the Materia Medica.

396
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:10,410
In the beginning we did not have Repertory, we only had provings.

397
01:11:10,510 --> 01:11:20,860
The Repertory developed out of
several things. One was the proving.

398
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:31,260
The second was the clinical experience
 that we have upon these provings

399
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:45,900
and then we saw that in this clinical
 experience, intensity was also important.

400
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:57,940
So if we have frequency, clear and intensity,
we put it on 3 degrees. 3 underlines.

401
01:11:58,660 --> 01:12:13,760
 Bold letters means as when you take the case, that you have underlined the symptom 3 times.

402
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:25,760
Italics 2 times and normal,
you have underlined one time.

403
01:12:26,730 --> 01:12:38,390
This is more or less, it is not an absolute
rule that if you have a symptom in bold,

404
01:12:38,490 --> 01:12:45,160
you underline 3 times, necessarily
you have to find it in bold letters.

405
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:58,870
 It is not an absolute rule but as a general
idea. The general idea is:

406
01:12:58,970 --> 01:13:07,530
when you have an intense and clear symptom
usually you will find it in bold letters.

407
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:21,480
Usually you will find it strongly in the remedy.
 So a symptom which is strong in the patient,
is strong in the remedy.

408
01:13:22,450 --> 01:13:30,340
Frequent in the patient, frequent in the remedy, intense in the patient, intense in the remedy,

409
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:38,160
clear in the patient, clear in the remedy.
 Is it clear now?

410
01:13:45,810 --> 01:14:01,760
So the underlining is important to match the case you study with the remedy you are going to find.

411
01:14:06,330 --> 01:14:20,640
Let's take a symptom, you say great exhaustion.
Underline 3 times, 4 times.

412
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:29,900
This great exhaustion you will find
 it in the remedies which are bold.

413
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:44,370
Other remedies have also exhaustion. If you see rubric, generalities, you say weakness.

414
01:14:44,470 --> 01:15:04,080
It's a big rubric.There are a lot of remedies
 in bold, almost 50 remedies which are in bold.

415
01:15:04,590 --> 01:15:11,610
 Out of these remedies Stannum
and Muriatic acid are also in bold.

416
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:21,600
Now we are making the Repertory.
This is not the final Repertory.

417
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:26,240
We are making the Repertory all the time.

418
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:36,270
In the next Repertory you will see Mur-ac
 and Stann in the fourth degree.

419
01:15:36,370 --> 01:15:49,370
That means we have out of clinical
experience elevated the Mur-ac or Stann

420
01:15:49,940 --> 01:15:57,180
to the 4th degree. So when you
have underlined 4 times the weakness

421
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:10,550
then you go and say 4 times is only Mur-ac, Carb-v and Stann, something like this.

422
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:32,640
This is a tool which is improving constantly. Currim is a person with the books.

423
01:16:33,530 --> 01:16:39,480
He read in the books, he came
and gave you his experience.

424
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:56,910
When somebody tells you something
 is not God who tells you the truth.

425
01:16:57,010 --> 01:17:02,520
I tell you something, I maybe wrong.
It's my perception, my experience.

426
01:17:06,510 --> 01:17:21,560
You do not take it as, George said, Currim said.
What about your brains?

427
01:17:22,620 --> 01:17:38,020
If we could have such boxes in
which we can say, ok, 3-3, 2-2, 1-1,

428
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:43,020
if we could have that then we would not have human beings, we would have robots.

429
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:51,650
 Only robots, machines can
be put in such boxes. Not human beings.

430
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:58,330
Especially human being who are evolving.

431
01:17:58,430 --> 01:18:09,560
We don't have the brains of our
ancestors 2000 years ago.

432
01:18:09,660 --> 01:18:26,570
The Greeks were very bright people, philosophers but most of the other population

433
01:18:26,670 --> 01:18:32,700
had a totally different mentality
than what we have today.

434
01:18:32,890 --> 01:18:39,280
Today we are all Socrates and Plato,
we are big brains.

435
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:52,320
We have evolved from the state of instincts in which we have acted for thousands of years,

436
01:18:52,420 --> 01:19:05,890
 to control.
That's why we talk about Lill-t.

437
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:20,120
 Lill-t is a person who controls. Why she controls? Because she wants to evolve

438
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:28,610
she wants to feel that she is one with God.
 She wants to be one with the truth.

439
01:19:29,010 --> 01:19:41,560
Socrates what he did? They say that he was walking in Athens and suddenly he would stop

440
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:48,260
 and it doesn't matter if you talk to him or anything, he would not answer.

441
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:53,960
For half an hour he stayed like this,
immovable and then started walking again.

442
01:19:54,060 --> 01:20:07,030
That means, he had to solve a problem so
he wanted stillness to touch God, truth.

443
01:20:07,780 --> 01:20:21,140
 The same is with diseases. They come and they evolve you. The say, suffering makes you better.

444
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:27,880
The instinctive people are very aggressive,
very nasty, killing each other.

445
01:20:28,050 --> 01:20:35,150
Not that we don't kill today but we think it
twice or we discuss it, shall we kill or not,

446
01:20:35,250 --> 01:20:44,710
which is an improvement. Still we
are evolving as human beings.

447
01:20:44,950 --> 01:20:54,120
 So a case of Sepia today is totally
different than a case of Sepia 2000 years ago.

448
01:20:54,260 --> 01:21:04,330
Sepia 2000 years ago, she was
having a lot of leucorrhea.

449
01:21:04,430 --> 01:21:14,380
Now she has this idea with God,
shall I find God etc.

450
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:19,080
It's similar things which are
happening but on a different level.

451
01:21:19,180 --> 01:21:26,710
The disease has gone on a different level for Sepia. But at the same time there is a change

452
01:21:26,850 --> 01:21:31,600
in structure of the human being. You can not have the same Repertory 2000 years ago

453
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:36,080
and have it today. It has to improve.

454
01:21:36,370 --> 01:21:43,350
So Currim said, yes but 200 years ago
 this is what was said.

455
01:21:45,230 --> 01:21:52,800
It might  be said, not exactly.
 I don't think he's even right that but

456
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:56,980
doesn't matter I take it as if
he is right in what he says.

457
01:21:57,080 --> 01:22:06,760
Still in 200 years of evolution
we have come in different concept today.

458
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:14,560
And what does it mean? Frequency, frequency,
 if you take intensity and frequency

459
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:20,200
you will not see much difference.
Somebody who suffers a lot with headaches,

460
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:31,050
 he doesn't talk about frequency.
He says 'I have a terrible headache', ok.

461
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:41,830
And you have terrible headaches twice a year. But when you have crisis, it's a severe crisis.

462
01:22:41,930 --> 01:22:48,520
So you go and see Belladonna in capital.

463
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:54,760
What is it? The intensity that makes you
go to Belladonna, not the frequency.
