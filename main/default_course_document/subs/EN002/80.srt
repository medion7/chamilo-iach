1
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:28,118
-She said that she was a Reiki master.
 I remember one time you said to us

2
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:35,778
that these kinds of energies are not necessary the best thing to go with homeopathic treatment.

3
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:45,208
-Who is a Reiki master? Can I speak freely?
-Yes.

4
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:06,728
-A Reiki master is somebody who deals with the energy. They put their hands or something.

5
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:21,688
Putting hands it's nice. It can create a good atmosphere, a good feeling.

6
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,718
That's all.

7
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:41,848
You can be very nice to somebody in the same way like touching.

8
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:49,358
You have to have a lot of energy to be able really to infuence the energy of another person.

9
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:57,938
Just by coming near to this person. You have to have a lot of energy, spare energy.

10
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:09,778
That you are infuencing really in some way the energy of another person.

11
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:23,338
The problem is that when you do this, when you approach your hands and you try to do what? You don't know.

12
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:34,368
You just hope that by approaching your hands something will happen. You don't know what is happening.

13
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:45,978
This is something so much in the dark that anybody can claim anything.

14
00:02:47,220 --> 00:03:01,208
I had a lot of students claiming that I am not a Reiki master but a master of treating with hands, a spiritual healer.

15
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:18,318
To be a spiritual healer that means you have an energy which is so much in relation to the cosmic energy,

16
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:34,638
 that you can manipulate this cosmic energy and specifically make that person well. What is this? Is that possible?

17
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:50,058
Is there such a person? You see Christ is considered the highest of the different leaders.

18
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:59,638
Still when he was trying to do a healing he said, do you believe?

19
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:10,187
So he needed the belief of the person to trigger the mechanism.

20
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:15,808
He said, do you believe? Yes.
 If you believe you will be cured.

21
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:26,988
If you believe, you will be cured but to have a strong belief really, very strong to trigger this.

22
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:45,758
If Christ needed the faith of the person in order to do a healing, how can a normal human being do a healing

23
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:57,608
without the other person believing 100% in his abilities?

24
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:12,108
It's a very dangerous thing for me to deal with. Because you get the impression sometimes is acting, is helping.

25
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:21,428
And then you get a case where is not helping and another case is not helping and then the people

26
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:28,270
these spiritual healers become quite disturbed.

27
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:49,078
-I'm married to a Reiki healer. She is a Reiki master, she doesn't call herself a master because the energy masters her.

28
00:05:49,120 --> 00:06:00,088
She works not through the energy but through universal energy. She studied for 3 years and she is practicing

29
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:14,208
since November last year. She's had phenomenal success. Wonderful success and my memory from the Organon

30
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:22,350
is that Hahnemann spoke about mesmerism and I tie that in with Reiki energy.

31
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:37,338
-I have also said that there is such a thing. The difference is that it's so rare to find this.

32
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:46,678
It's so rare that it's not something to be taught from one individual to another.

33
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:57,198
Because there are stories we hear, like miracles happening with saints.

34
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:08,438
These are what we call the placebo effect. The faith on the person gives this triggering

35
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:24,410
which is similar to the idea of the remedy and the person gets better. If you manage to do that, it's a good placebo effect.

36
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:34,801
-I don't think to be anybody particularly great. I am a vet and I had one case of hands using.

37
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,008
The dog was dying, it was about 14 years old.

38
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,948
-You are American?
-Yes.

39
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:52,088
The dog was dying and he was about 14 years old, he was in a cage, he was 3 days and after that he was going to be euthanized.

40
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:02,218
-Calm down. It's very nice hearing everbody
 likes you. There is no hurry.

41
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,048
-So I asked my boss if I could try something, I just wanted to meditate.

42
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,528
-He said, do whatever you like. The dog is going to be killed in half an hour.

43
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:19,288
So I opened the cage and I hold on to the dog's paw and I'm not a very strong person but I just tried to open myself up

44
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,097
and to pray in God's energy to come through me.
Within 5 minutes it was a huge electric shock that passed from my hands

45
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:34,488
 on the dog's paw and I jumped up and screamed and the dog jumped up and got up and ate a ball of food

46
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:43,498
 and went home. And I found that it didn't have any follow up for 3 years. A man that worked for me said, 'I heard what you did

47
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:56,200
 with that dog he lived for another 3 years perfectly well and died a natural death in a storm'.

48
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:00,268
-What was the pathology with the dog?
 Do you remember?

49
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:08,778
-Just wasting away. I had to keep looking to see if it was breathing, it was bearly alive.

50
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:21,288
-His boss was there? He was alive or he had lost his master?

51
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:31,178
-The master went the dog to the hospital because he was dying and he hadn't eaten in several weeks.

52
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:36,428
All I knew was that the dog looked like it was dead, I don't know the pathology.

53
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:46,592
But I did this and it was amazing, it went back home and the dog was totally normal.

54
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:54,668
I tried to replicate that afterwards and I would never take any money for that and I was never able to do it again.

55
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:59,768
-Thank you, this is what I was expecting. I would ask you could you replicate that?

56
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:09,778
This was a special occasion in which you felt very much sympathy to this dog. You really wanted to help.

57
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:13,168
-I don't know if it was that, I think I was very open.

58
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:24,838
-Yes, I understand this. This is mentalising. Actually you felt very great sympathy for this dog and you wanted to help this dog.

59
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:37,448
And you transferred the energy needed for this dog to come back. It was like giving him a homeopathic remedy.

60
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,179
-But it was not a placebo.

61
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:53,265
-It's not a placebo, this is not a placebo. This is transferring energy through you to the dog and this is what made the dog come back.

62
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:58,208
-And I really wanted to replicate because I said this is a lot easier than Homeopathy.

63
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:04,630
I don't need to study anymore !

64
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:14,968
-That is nice. Before I answer I have a similar experience.

65
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:26,598
Some of you, you know the story but it doesn't matter, most of you, you don't know.

66
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:50,408
I always in my backyard had chicken and I did not have a cock and my neighbour gave me a cock.

67
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:57,048
So I can fertilise the eggs, so the cock was the master of the chicken.

68
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:07,392
In the meantime some other patient of mine knew that I needed a cock and one day he brought me a cock.

69
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:23,408
And I put the cock of the neighbour inside a glass house and I let the new cock coming, with the hens.

70
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:34,538
It was evening, night I can't remember but I left the cock safe. Otherwise I knew they may fight and could kill each other.

71
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:50,688
Next day, 11 o' clock Sunday I go out to the glass house to take the cock and return it to my neighbour opposite door.

72
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:58,850
I go inside the glass house and the cock is dead.

73
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:08,698
So I take the cock and say, oh my god what happened?

74
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:16,358
I take the cock and I don't know what to say now. Yesterday he was in perfect health, now he is dead.

75
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:28,368
You know the dead cock, you hold him like this. So I go to my neighboor but I'm trying to understand

76
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:36,538
what kind of a disease is this affecting the cock? The bird flu or something.

77
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:50,928
I proceed and before I reach the house, it was only 30 meters, I realised what has happened.

78
00:13:51,000 --> 00:14:06,688
I realise that the cock that was inside the glass house was seeing the other cock with the chicken

79
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:18,910
and he was charging against the glass until he had a head injury and he died.

80
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:33,558
So I realise this and I take the cock, go to my neighbour and I say, ok the cock has died recently.

81
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:46,598
Would you like to eat the cock?
He said, no, no, no.

82
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:54,938
Nevermind how he died. It's something disgusting. You cannot eat a dead cock.

83
00:14:55,010 --> 00:15:05,248
She says, no, no, no throw him.
I said, either you eat him or I will resurrect him.

84
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:14,008
She couldn't believe what I said. How can you resurrect a dead cock?

85
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:27,448
That cock is dead, how can you resurrect him? I said ok keep him here, I go and bring a medicine.

86
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:45,988
I go and bring Arnica, high potency. I put it in a little water and I open his mouth and put 1-2 drops in his mouth.

87
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:57,448
And you won't believe it but the moment I put the drop there is a slight movement of one of his  wings.

88
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:12,118
Just a little jerk. I said, ok I cannot stay with the cock all day but if you want the cock alive, you keep on giving

89
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:25,138
 every hour, you give 1-2 drops. By the evening the cock was up and was going around. She couldn't believe it.

90
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:33,368
This is a fantastic medicine George, we have to have some medicine, give us this medicine.

91
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:48,608
In case some brain stroke happens so we can use the medication. It's like this you know, the energy which is synchronised

92
00:16:48,680 --> 00:17:03,728
it can resurrect. The cock was not entirely dead, it was bleeding, it was having a brain stroke.

93
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:14,478
Arnica dissolved this, because it was recent, within a few hours and the cock was resurrected.

94
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:27,368
I do not deny this. This is a real experience and it's amazing.

95
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:34,338
For me it's not amazing I can understand it. What she did it was really synchronising the energy.

96
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,388
-But I really would like to replicate it.

97
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:51,618
-I know, I know but this is what I say. If you try to replicate forcefully, I mean by doing it, you can damage yourself really.

98
00:17:51,690 --> 00:18:04,978
You can feel out of balance. At a certain moment you may find out that your mind is going "cucu" that you're going crazy.

99
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:16,448
It's a dangerous thing so you have to be very careful in dealing with this.

100
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:27,028
You see with homeopathic remedy is totally different because you give the remedy and you're detached from the person.

101
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:35,568
If you're attaching every time yourself with your energy to another person, you do not know

102
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:41,368
the transference that can happen the other way around.

103
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:54,389
And how much influence this can have.
For instance if a homeopath needs Phosphorus

104
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:02,088
and he does not know it, they are very sympathetic with the patient.

105
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:12,028
The patient comes, they feel almost what the patient has, they feel it in themselves.

106
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:23,668
This person either you take Phosphorus or you give up the job. This is dangerous if you are so sensitive.

107
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:31,648
You see I remember a case of Phosphorus in America, she was so sensitive

108
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:37,688
she would perceive every feeling of any person.

109
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:48,948
She had a painful experience and she had to close herself up in the appartment, for years

110
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:54,328
staying inside to the appartment, without being able to associate with people.

111
00:19:54,930 --> 00:20:01,688
Because of the painful experiences, the receiving. You know what it is?

112
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:14,288
I mean we are protected, we are closed up. Otherwise whatever happens to somebody, you perceive it.

113
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:29,808
If you open up completely, you see like some people who are able to do this, they call themselves mediums or whatever.

114
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:39,878
They are suffering quite a lot and they can go into bigger problems and troubles.

115
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:45,080
Because they open up and they cannot close.

116
00:20:49,610 --> 00:21:11,168
I know quite a lot of healing books. A lot of claims about healing, I'm very reserved into believing because

117
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:26,168
 in my life as you may understand, I have seen a lot of people, really honest people who believed in such things.

118
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:34,658
Which when we try to put it in examination, it didn't work, it failed.

119
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:46,048
It's so easy to say I can see the aura, because there is such a thing as an aura. We all know it.
But who can see it?

120
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:57,768
And who can see the aura and through the aura recognize that this is an aura which is affected in the liver?

121
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:07,740
This is another story. So a lot of people can say it because it's a secret, it is closed from investigation

122
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:21,658
and anybody can say whatever they like or they can project their imagination. They imagine they see an aura.

123
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:37,338
 If you talk about Kirlian photography, I would say I'm investigating at this moment Kirlian photography

124
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:49,480
 in a way that can show me to my satisfaction, whether Kirlian photography can really photograph the aura, yes or no.

125
00:22:51,210 --> 00:23:00,683
-Some years ago a German documentary maker he was visiting the "who is who" all over the world of healers.

126
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:10,448
He was for 6 years, was going to United States, to Indonesia, to all over and he made 80 hours of recording

127
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:18,008
'Healers in action'. And then he made a movie for the movie theaters which was only 1 hour so you could see

128
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:23,378
different healers and at the end he says, it's all the same. All that they do it stimulates the life force,

129
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:31,158
 it doesn't matter if they dance around you, if they paint you blue and they send you to get diarrhoea to Peru,

130
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:36,728
but they stimulate your immune system. Very interesting film.

131
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:43,088
-Yes, that we accept that can happen sometimes.

132
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:53,258
I will tell you so many stories with the pendulum. People believe in pendulum.

133
00:23:55,060 --> 00:24:00,218
I'll tell you what's your remedy. That's your remedy because of the pendulum.

134
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:07,728
Whenever I tried I've never seen any real effect, any true.

135
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:21,718
Hundreds of things. I was in Holland and a medical doctor came to me and said, there is a woman

136
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:32,968
who will hold this and will know if there is a potentised remedy in the bottle.

137
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:40,368
I said, is that true? Any bottle, she will hold and will say, yes this is potentised.

138
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:50,088
We were in Amsterdam, she was in another town. Can you call the woman? Yes, we call the woman.

139
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:57,218
We make an experiment. What was the experiment? 10 bottles, 3 of them contained potentised remedies.

140
00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:10,168
Ok, find these 3 potentised remedies. Find them. You know all the students were around, I did not know which are the potentised.

141
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:19,168
It was written in an envelope. Potentised number 1, 9 and 10.

142
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:37,328
The woman comes, takes 1, 2, 3 this potentised, this is potentised. Ok see the numbers. Number 2,7 and 8.

143
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:47,028
Potentised number 1, 9 and 10. Not one. I said, ok maybe she was a little bit excited because there was a lot of people around.

144
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:53,538
We repeat the experiment. We repeated 3 times.

145
00:25:53,610 --> 00:26:03,028
The doctor who was bringing this patient was swearing that this woman can feel when a bottle

146
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:13,073
is having a potentised remedy. I said, I don't believe it but I'm really interested very much.

147
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:23,728
3 times she could not get one
 By chance she could have got one.

148
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:47,208
He said, 'I'm surprised', ok but what you're saying is so unbelievable to have such a sensitivity to feel the potentised remedy.

149
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:55,708
We need that woman to check whether the remedies are potentised. We use her as a check up.

150
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:06,048
I will hire her, I will pay her to tell me if the remedy is correct.

151
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:14,458
Lots of other times, the same thing with the machine which is potentising.

152
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:26,378
Scientists of the NASA, no, no, 'George this machine can potentise the remedy'... but this is not possible.

153
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:40,168
'No, no, no George you are closed, you don't understand this machine will potentise if you turn it in such way', Pulsatilla 10M.

154
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:45,688
I said, I was exasperated, I said forget it.

155
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:52,428
Then after some time he felt ill with Hepatitis B, severely ill.

156
00:27:52,500 --> 00:28:02,688
This was in India, I was not there. After a few days he calls me, he was in a terrible state. I went there to see him.

157
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:16,858
I said, ok now it is time to really have an experience. I will put the remedy and you take it, to see if you have an effect.

158
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:35,528
Now is the time. Take the remedy. He takes the remedy. Tomorrow I come and see you.

159
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:47,598
Tomorrow, 'how are you'? 'I'm terrible, exhausted'. I said, 'no take another dose'.

160
00:28:55,160 --> 00:29:06,348
'We may have to wait because you tried to persuade me that this machine can make a potentised remedy.

161
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:22,838
So this is the time that your test is here'. I left him for 3-4 days but he said finally, 'give me the remedy'.

162
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:33,508
I said ok, go to the pharmacy, brought it to him. Because the remedy was clear.

163
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:40,738
Within 2 days, the next hours he was feeling his energy coming. The next day much better.

164
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:49,888
2,3,4 days later, he was free. I said, ok what shall we do with this. He says, I give it to you.

165
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:55,080
I said, you throw it to the dustbin.
