1
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,620
I have been asked to speak about certain topics,

2
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:30,980
one of which is for experienced practitioners.

3
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:42,870
And to underline the difficulties that exist in homeopathic prescribing

4
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:49,730
and blockages that may exist during homeopathic prescribing.

5
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:08,430
Before going into that subject I would like to discuss a little bit the origination of symptoms.

6
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:12,030
How symptoms are originated.

7
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:26,100
I do this because in my lectures on Materia Medica I'm going to discuss

8
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:35,010
about the different levels of symptomatology in the human body,

9
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:40,540
which is the mental level, the emotional level and also the physical level.

10
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:54,610
We see a symptomatology arising in all three levels, especially with people of today.

11
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:05,690
People of today seem to have a symptomatology, which is mostly on mental-emotional levels

12
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:11,110
and not so much on physical levels, as it used to be in older times.

13
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:26,040
So the symptomatology that we see today arises from stresses on different levels.

14
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:36,940
Apart from the symptomatology that arises from specific agents like viruses,

15
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,860
microbes, bacteria etc. that they may attack the human body

16
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:49,440
and the human body can react apart from these stresses,

17
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:58,710
we have symptomatology arising from conflicts, which are on 3 main areas.

18
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:20,100
The main area that is it is stressed, when it is conflict, it's the area of self-preservation.

19
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:27,520
When the instinct of self-preservation is in danger, then we have a symptomatology,

20
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,950
which may appear in all three levels.

21
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:36,950
What do I mean by self-preservation? I mean mostly...

22
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:45,200
What preserves life? Food. When people cannot get food,

23
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:55,870
food in its more wide sense, then this instinct is in conflict, it's in stress.

24
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,610
You don't need examples.

25
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:06,360
Somebody is very poor, he is living in a very stressed situation, cannot find a job,

26
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:10,280
cannot find a way to support himself or his family

27
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:16,690
and eventually he will come down with heart problem, with stomach problem

28
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:30,710
or with a skin eruption. The second area is when there is conflict in the space we live.

29
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:37,320
We need our space and if we lose that, we may have a conflict

30
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,100
and out of this conflict a symptomatology may arise.

31
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,100
That means I lose my house, I do not have a space to live on,

32
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:54,350
I lose my possibility to have a space, to pay a rent and to have a space,

33
00:04:54,450 --> 00:05:01,450
this can be a stressful factor that can again produce symptomatology.

34
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:13,860
And the third possibility is losing the possibility of survival on a continuous level.

35
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:24,130
That means losing the children that in a way will further our existence into the future.

36
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:31,770
Losing the children or losing conditions under which this continuation will take place

37
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:35,000
can create a great conflict.

38
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:45,020
In general this conflict is very strong when there is a possibility of death,

39
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,370
a possibility of the physical body being killed.

40
00:05:53,620 --> 00:06:00,620
The second area from which symptomatology can arise is the sexual sphere.

41
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:06,130
The sex life with all that it contains.

42
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,870
I will not go into many details, I will just say a few things.

43
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:21,610
What is sex need and when there is conflict in that area, then you have problems?

44
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:26,350
What is the need? To have sex is not to have sex actually.

45
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:34,450
The deeper need is to give yourself and be accepted.

46
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,750
To unite, as an idea, with another individual.

47
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:48,450
This is the deeper need to unite and be accepted, to lose your identity,

48
00:06:48,550 --> 00:07:05,210
to lose your self-awareness, with all the repercussions that exist in this level.

49
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:13,620
What we see today as diseases are frustrations on these levels we are talking about.

50
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,950
Symptomatology is arising through frustration on this level

51
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:27,720
with all the emotional repercussions that we have concerning this issue.

52
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:41,540
The third level of frustration, when we have frustration on conflict, is what?

53
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:50,200
There is a third area from which frustration really rises?

54
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,060
Can anybody tell me because the other two are quite well known.

55
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:10,380
The spiritual question, the spiritual conflict, the spiritual frustration.

56
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:27,050
What we have here as an idea behind that, the need of the man to unite with the cosmos.

57
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:34,270
The individual is not anymore satisfied with the unification of an individual

58
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:37,520
with another individual, man with woman etc.

59
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,800
You know what I mean by etc.

60
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:50,280
It's not that enough. Frustration is too much.

61
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:55,860
People don't feel satisfied, there is something else, something else.

62
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,950
What is this something else? That something else will drive them

63
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:05,690
eventually to a search to find out what is beyond that physical world

64
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:14,290
and what is beyond what we call god, the divine, the cosmos, the super intelligence.

65
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,450
Whatever it is that for everyone makes sense.

66
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:24,440
In this area we have frustrations again, frustrations arising,

67
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:32,530
diseases arising from frustration in this area where man needs to be united with the cosmos.

68
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,780
In the beginning man is very simple.

69
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,200
He needs to be united with the environment, the nature.

70
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:44,800
This is the unification with nature, self-preservation.

71
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:53,030
The primitive man must have thought that this nature is my own, it is my house,

72
00:09:53,130 --> 00:10:02,450
there is no threat and then the man came to take his land and frustration...

73
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:12,280
We have to see now humanity progressing through these eras

74
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:18,450
where frustration was very much on physical level on self-preservation instinct,

75
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:25,450
my space, my food, my children and man tries to solve these problems

76
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,450
and to give solutions to these problems.

77
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:32,690
He says democracy, people must have the same rights, they must equals.

78
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:40,180
They found solutions on these problems and then the era of sex came...

79
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:50,680
I mean the era of a deeper need now of an individual to have a satisfying union,

80
00:10:50,780 --> 00:11:01,190
satisfying communication with another person, the era of love.

81
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:04,940
Men most probably didn't know anything about love before.

82
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,310
They did not understand, it was on a very animalistic level.

83
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:16,570
There come cries with the idea of love and then people take that idea

84
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:21,940
and they start thinking about love and about your neighbor etc.

85
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:31,030
As the human beings are progressing in time we see more frustration

86
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:38,940
on this level as well. More frustration, more diseases.

87
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,690
What kind of diseases? More complicated.

88
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:58,130
More we have the frustrations that came upon misusing all what we had conquered.

89
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:04,270
We have conquered the idea that we have the right to have a house

90
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:09,690
and then we want a second, a third, a fifth, 20 houses.

91
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:13,460
There is something unhealthy there.

92
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:18,020
Then we conquered the idea that we want to have a sexual partner and we have a second,

93
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:25,620
a fourth, a fifth, 25, 250... Why not to have experiences.

94
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:31,700
We are going to pay for all that and we are paying already.

95
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:46,440
I don't want to frighten you but I have some very frightening ideas

96
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:52,110
concerning different diseases that are going to appear.

97
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:58,690
I was lecturing on those topics in Greece 15 years and I was telling

98
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:06,690
that humanity was going on under the bombardment of antibiotics and chemical drugs

99
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:16,780
to stimulate and to counteract diseases, especially the venereal diseases

100
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:24,270
which exploded because of promiscuity we are going to have a new type of diseases very soon

101
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:28,120
that will be so virulent that nobody will be able to treat.

102
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:36,620
Now we have come to these ideas and nobody knows why.

103
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,520
But for me it is very plain and I hope I will be wrong.

104
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:47,860
That by bombarding the human body with antibiotics and all strong remedies

105
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:54,770
we are producing a defective immune system that can receive now,

106
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:59,860
it can develop a lot of new diseases which are very virulent.

107
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:11,600
I believe soon we will be finding out that AIDS is the main disease, let us say,

108
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:17,530
that came upon the conflict on the sexual level, on sexual frustration.

109
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:29,440
It's a venereal disease transmitted through sexual act

110
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:38,010
but it will come to those who are bombarded with antibiotics for 1,2,3 5 years.

111
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:42,010
What we see in the homosexuals, it's not the homosexuals.

112
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:47,340
It's all the people who have repeatedly taken venereal diseases

113
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:53,440
and they have treated these venereal diseases with antibiotics and penicillin.

114
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:58,260
It is these people actually, never mind who takes syphilis five times.

115
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:05,080
In Tahiti syphilis was very prevalent and this is very well know.

116
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,670
People have taken a lot of antibiotics there.

117
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:12,010
Of course anybody who takes antibiotics for a year, two years constantly...

118
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:17,330
What we see in the AIDS patients is a history of 2 syphilis, 5 gonorrheas

119
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:22,100
or 4 syphilis, 6 gonorrheas or 3 gonorrheas, 4 syphillis.

120
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,220
That requires constant antibiotics.

121
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,010
The immune system is totally bombarded.

122
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:38,530
This is the appearance of the disease on a conflict on sexual level.

123
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:53,430
Man actually seeks unity because he is afraid by himself, he is so much afraid.

124
00:15:53,750 --> 00:16:02,110
And women also, it's not men only. I see men and I see the women laughing.

125
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:14,950
Seeking unity is the idea in spiritual frustration and conflict.

126
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:25,100
What do you want really? Do you want a spiritual (?)

127
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:38,850
Are you going for the experience of a spiritual 'kick', what they call

128
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:45,110
or are you searching sincerely to find out the truth?

129
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:48,050
These are basics questions.

130
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:53,890
Do you really want just a home to stay or you are like Onassis,

131
00:16:53,990 --> 00:17:03,720
one ship, two ships, 25, 35...where do you stop?

132
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:08,570
You conquered the whole world, all the ships of the world to belong to you to do what?

133
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:17,800
A friend of his told me that when he was dying he had 75 doctors

134
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:21,730
from all over the world in Paris around him.

135
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:29,570
But he still died and perhaps quicker than somebody who would have only one doctor.

136
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:35,560
Because 75 doctors are 75 opinions, you can understand.

137
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:39,910
One says take the kidney out, no, no the other one says take the liver out.

138
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:49,060
I believe he had several operations except from his bladder that was taken initially out.

139
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,410
Several operations at a row, then of course you die.

140
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,740
I want to give you now the idea of where we stand.

141
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:24,740
What as healers we are going to achieve.

142
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:34,470
What is the problem? Realizing, facing the real problem and then say now how shall I proceed,

143
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,240
what shall I do?

144
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:51,150
Before go further I may also say that as the two other conflicts,

145
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:59,720
that means self-preservation and sexual, are minimized in us, the more they are minimized,

146
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:07,100
the more they become vital for us the more the spiritual conflict arises.

147
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:20,060
That means an individual has to overcome his insecurities, anxieties and quite a lot in order

148
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:27,420
to go into the other conflict, the third conflict which is the spiritual.

149
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:36,640
He has overcome certain things, he says I'm not interested about having a fleet,

150
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:41,640
I'm not interested about having 20 houses, this is stupid, I don't want that.

151
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:46,640
What do I want? Sex. He has sex and he says eventually I'm not interested in that.

152
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:56,890
I had enough, 250 cases it's too much. I had enough.

153
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:01,140
I still need this feeling of fulfillment which is not there, the feeling

154
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:07,740
that I belong somewhere in the cosmos and then he goes into spiritual search.

155
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:16,850
So today we are faced with a crisis, which is mostly on a spiritual level.

156
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:27,810
When I see people where almost every one of them is on this frustration level,

157
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:40,570
the spiritual level, I'm really amazed that the world has gone so fast in the last 20 years.

158
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:54,230
Here we are to treat and to say OK, what is your problem?

159
00:20:54,330 --> 00:21:00,980
He comes there with his problem and he says what is the remedy

160
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,060
that will give him back everything?

161
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:11,240
He expects from the homeopathic remedy to have a complete balance of that individual.

162
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:20,980
Do we expect also to solve the conflicts which were responsible for bringing

163
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,230
that individual into that state?

164
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:28,140
Do we expect to do that and to what extend?

165
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,400
These are questions that have tormented my mind for many years

166
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:39,910
and I would like to give you my ideas, my thinking about it.

167
00:21:53,240 --> 00:22:04,080
You know that we have the Organon of Medicine written by Hahnemann?

168
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:15,920
Sometimes people are practicing Homeopathy without even knowing the existence of that book.

169
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:32,140
In paragraph 252 and 255 there are some hints and note 140...

170
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,970
there are some hints of what I'm going to talk.

171
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:52,700
I like to be as clear as possible, as concise as possible.

172
00:22:52,800 --> 00:23:05,860
That's why I would like to give you before going into blockages an idea of what I think

173
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:12,050
we are doing when we are treating a human being.

174
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:26,950
From that point of view a human being is something which is there,

175
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:44,040
which exists and which is the deepest, the most real desires.

176
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:48,110
What is a human being? It's his most deep desires.

177
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:52,530
That is what he is, that is what he wants to attain.

178
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:59,280
What is the deepest in him, the deepest being, the deepest existence, the deepest desire,

179
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,750
that is what he is.

180
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:13,470
The question arises by homeopathic treatment can we change that? No.

181
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:18,470
Disease changes that?

182
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:25,300
No but what disease changes then?

183
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:38,530
A person that was very bright and he had a lot of possibilities in developing a life

184
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:49,640
and then he goes into drugs...I know something about drugs here in Holland.

185
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:04,460
He goes into drugs and then this fine mind starts to become dull.

186
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:11,360
Why he has a fine mind, why he has fine tools to work with?

187
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,530
He was going to attain certain things in life.

188
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:20,890
What happened by going into drugs?

189
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:26,120
When I say drugs I do not mean only the hallucinogenic drugs,

190
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:30,460
I mean the whole industry, official and non-official.

191
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:40,110
There is an official industry as well, which is the Valium, the Tavor, the barbiturates etc.

192
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:47,640
This is the official industry, prescription drugs and then there is an unofficial industry.

193
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:58,300
I don't know which of the two are bringing more money but then there is there.

194
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:05,550
And then you are injecting in the human body all these drugs.

195
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:16,510
As a result this mind that was going to attain whatever he was going to attain, it is destroyed.

196
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:29,240
This is the deepest part of man which cannot be changed.

197
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:37,970
That deepest part now it's going to be expressed through a harmonious kind of expression -

198
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:40,570
I don't know how harmonious is...

199
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:52,410
I've broken my elbow a few months ago.

200
00:26:55,160 --> 00:27:03,810
This was going to be a harmonious expression of what it was there.

201
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:24,260
He had the means to express and the means were his qualities in mental level.

202
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:35,170
He had logic, logical mind, he had discriminative mind,

203
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:55,740
he had the ability of abstract thinking, he had the ability to classify correctly,

204
00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:03,560
he had the ability to analyze, all these positive qualities of that human being

205
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:08,080
that was expressing himself in this way.

206
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:29,730
What disease does is that match, affects these abilities to his no longer able to express

207
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:35,480
in a harmonious and creative way that that was existing in him.

208
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:44,640
That means he will never be able to attain the highest purposes of his existence.

209
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:55,660
This is paragraph 16 in the Organon, 11 or 16.

210
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:17,070
What disease does is to affect these qualities and take them mostly to the negative side.

211
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:29,550
Between complete logic, total logic and total insanity there are grades.

212
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:43,150
So disease will take these means of logic towards its opposite, its negative quality.

213
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:53,150
From somebody who had discrimination, he will have now no discrimination at all.

214
00:29:56,150 --> 00:30:00,390
Where he was able to have abstract thinking,

215
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:12,170
which is the highest kind of function of the human mind, now his thinking becomes dull,

216
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:17,670
there is no reflection and there is no ability to abstract thinking.

217
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:25,650
He was able to classify things, now things are coming in a mixed way.

218
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:29,310
He was able to analyze, he is not able to analyze anymore.

219
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:32,020
That is what disease does.

220
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:46,060
What we see finally in disease, expression of that individual is very confusing

221
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:51,050
but the inside of the human being is intact.

222
00:30:51,150 --> 00:31:01,140
Now what happens is that he will not be able to really attain

223
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,020
what his innermost being wanted to attain.

224
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:17,310
And he comes to us to be treated and our work is to take away these confusions

225
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:28,560
that disease has imprinted upon him on the means, on his tools for evolvement.

226
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:34,030
We must take away these confusions and let the most inner self express itself

227
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:36,540
in the best possible way.

228
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:52,940
This is what we have to do when a person presents himself into us

229
00:31:53,040 --> 00:32:00,790
and says I used to think quite clearly and I cannot. I calculated and I cannot calculate.

230
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:24,930
You are all familiar with the idea that there are 3 levels

231
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:35,370
and also the idea that those 3 levels are connected with the defense mechanism here.

232
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:51,030
That is the mental-spiritual level, this is the psychic level or emotional level

233
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:58,280
and this is the physical level.

234
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:10,430
Every stress will be taken by the defense mechanism

235
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:16,770
and the defense mechanism will decide what will do, either he will present symptoms

236
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:22,940
on the mental level or he may present symptoms on the emotional level or on the physical level

237
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,370
or on all 3 levels.

238
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:34,020
Actually what is going on is always in that background

239
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:41,210
where the defense mechanism decides at all moments what he will do under stress.

240
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:52,530
When we're dealing with an individual we take always in consideration

241
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:58,210
what is on the mental level, what is on his emotional level, what is on the physical level.

242
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:08,610
On the mental-spiritual level what we see is that from positive qualities,

243
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:11,190
the individual goes to negative qualities.

244
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:14,130
The same on the emotional level.

245
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:25,200
Disease will take positive qualities to negative qualities.

246
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:32,130
Trust is a positive quality, mistrust...

247
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:42,370
Joy, depression, sadness...

248
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:51,130
Calmness, irritability, anger...

249
00:34:55,370 --> 00:35:04,360
This is where diseases are taking the individual towards its negative side

250
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:17,720
and when we study the Materia Medica we have to study what a remedy can do on spiritual-mental

251
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:26,780
and psychic-emotional and on physical level as well, in order to have a science

252
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:33,210
which is really complete.

253
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:44,530
We cannot be talking about Homeopathy and give remedies only for the physical level.

254
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:51,100
If we want really to have an effect with the homeopathic remedy,

255
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:56,860
we have to take into consideration all the disturbances that exist under conflicts

256
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:02,360
and frustrations on that individual on all 3 levels and find that remedy

257
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:09,710
which has produced similar disturbances on all 3 levels.

258
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:12,750
That's why when I'm lecturing on the Materia Medica,

259
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:17,090
I'm lecturing in a 3-dimensional way.

260
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:36,990
We cannot anymore afford what the old masters sometimes did, the 6X, 12X on the physical body.

261
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:47,090
By this time all these frustrations were not so intense, as they are today

262
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:58,990
and especially on spiritual level, which creates mentalities that are quite different today

263
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:01,940
that what it was 100 years ago.

264
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:12,210
It's interesting perhaps for you to give you a little bit of information

265
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:17,570
what is going on in Greece concerning Homeopathy at the moment.

266
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:25,470
Just to show perhaps that Classical Homeopathy, the way the every medical doctor

267
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:39,660
who is in Greece is practicing, it is a very practical thing, it's not an idealistic situation.

268
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,810
I introduced Homeopathy in Greece on 1967.

269
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:49,990
On 1967 there was no a homeopath in Greece at all.

270
00:37:51,020 --> 00:38:01,970
In 1985 that was about one month ago, the Minister of Health in Greece

271
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:10,800
sent a letter to the Hellenic Homeopathic Association asking them to propose ways

272
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:18,050
that the homeopathic doctors wanted to work on the National Service.

273
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:24,970
That means paid by the government to serve people homeopathically

274
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:32,560
and that is purely because of the results and the prestige that Homeopathy enjoys in Greece

275
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:36,960
at this moment. For no other reason.

276
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:41,890
I don't believe that the government in Greece is more enlightened

277
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:44,740
than any other government in Europe.

278
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:56,710
But they have been seen results and also the medical establishment of Greece

279
00:38:56,810 --> 00:39:02,060
has a great kind of esteem for homeopathy.

280
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:09,310
That is within 18 years what was attained through purely Classical Homeopathy.

281
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:17,310
In other countries, let's take France where Homeopathy is very widely spread.

282
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:24,490
There they are practicing a kind of Homeopathy, which is mixopathy, that means mixtures.

283
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:35,390
It is a kind of Homeopathy but there is no prestige in France for Homeopathy,

284
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:36,710
the government is not interested.

285
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:42,140
They are making enquiries what is this mixture that you say it's good for rhinitis?

286
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:49,060
You have to prove that it is good for rhinitis or for bronchitis.

287
00:39:53,320 --> 00:40:00,390
What I'm talking to you is not spiritual idealistic kind of ideas,

288
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:09,860
they are very practical ideas that have very practical application.

289
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:25,150
Of course today I'm going to talk about blockages, that means excuses we have...

290
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:35,210
I'm going to give you a lot of excuses today that you may have

291
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:39,410
and give your patients if your treatment fails.

292
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:55,640
I gave this lecture in Norway, a few days ago and somebody said that's very good lecture,

293
00:40:55,740 --> 00:41:00,890
I liked it very much because from now I shall have a good excuse

294
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:06,150
why my treatment has failed.

295
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:24,380
Going in the same idea of 3 levels, we shall be talking about blockages

296
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:31,640
that can exist in all 3 levels, starting with the physical level.

297
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:39,080
What is that which maybe blocking a homeopathic treatment on a physical level.

298
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:47,390
That means you give the remedy, which is correct and yet it does not work

299
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:53,240
or does not deliver fully the effects that you are expecting too.

300
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:04,060
Before I go on with the excuses I have to give a percentage of cases

301
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:10,300
that may be coming under all these groups of cases.

302
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:18,810
The percentage should not be more than  between 7-10% of your cases

303
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:21,490
that may fall under these groups.

304
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:35,320
On the physical what can be blocking the effect of a homeopathic remedy.

305
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:41,660
Of the correct homeopathic remedy, not just a remedy.

306
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:47,570
You have given the right remedy and it does not act.

307
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:00,830
I will give you an example first.

308
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:12,220
What may happen is that you have a case with severe, very severe sciatic pains

309
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:23,570
which are constant and which are tremendously intense.

310
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:31,570
The person does not find any position that relieves him.

311
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:37,910
If you take his reflexes you will see some effect on the reflexes,

312
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:50,740
you will some effect on the sensors, his sensation of the foot are not perfect.

313
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:56,050
You take the picture and you give a remedy.

314
00:43:56,150 --> 00:44:03,720
This is the picture of Colocynthis because he has to go up and down, he has his pains etc.

315
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:12,180
You give Colocynthis 1M and it seems to work for 10 min or 15 min,

316
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:17,720
a little bit better the pains for 1 hr and then back the pains.

317
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:22,630
I made a mistake, that was not a Colocynthis, this is a Kali Iodinum case.

318
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:27,470
You give Kali Iodinum and you see some kind of effect perhaps

319
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:32,410
and then you go from one remedy to the other and no remedy will hold. Why?

320
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:42,180
Because we have a slip disc in between the vertebrae.

321
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:46,220
There is a disc that breaks sometimes and makes a hernia.

322
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:52,310
That comes out and presses one of the roots of the nerves constantly.

323
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:59,400
It's a mechanical pressure upon the roots of the nerves that will not allow

324
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:10,240
any kind of relief neither your remedy is going to work.

325
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:17,990
Or a big dislocation of a vertebrae, it's mechanical.

326
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:25,890
What you have to do? In the first instance you will have to know Medicine,

327
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:31,630
to know how to recognize such a state, then you have to put your patient into bed,

328
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:35,490
complete immobility.

329
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:40,390
He must not get up because the minute he gets up the pressure on the vertebrae

330
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:48,820
makes this hernia bigger and if he walks up and down makes the pain worse.

331
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:54,560
So you have to know that this is a mechanical pressure upon the nerve

332
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:59,360
that has to have other treatment as well.

333
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:04,390
In a case of hernia with the slip disc, you have to put your patient into bed

334
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:07,900
without moving at all, not to have pressure.

335
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:22,260
In a case of a big dislocation on another part of the vertebrae,

336
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:25,400
then you may have to apply other measures apart Homeopathy,

337
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:30,890
before the homeopathic remedy can affect the case.

338
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:36,050
If the dislocation is great, there are people who are dealing with the vertebrae.

339
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:44,490
They call themselves osteopaths in America or chiropractors in Europe.

340
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:53,050
They deal with these issues and maybe you will be needing a physiotherapist or chiropractor

341
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:56,820
or osteopath to deal with that problem.

342
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:02,970
So giving one remedy after the other will not help in such a case.

343
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:28,890
You are dealing with a case- I remember in India in the hospital where I was,

344
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:35,740
I remember a severe case of typhus, last stages.

345
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:43,900
They have been prescribing different remedies but at a certain moment

346
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:51,240
you touch the pulse of the person and you see the pulse going.... You can't count.

347
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,810
And the heart is pumping so fast, why?

348
00:47:54,910 --> 00:48:02,810
Because there is a perforation, there is a breach in the colon and the blood is coming out.

349
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:07,330
Finished, you have to apply surgical measures.

350
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:28,470
The same thing may apply to some surgical cases where you have a kind of tumor

351
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:32,160
that presses and creates symptomatology.

352
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:40,160
That mechanical pressure can create symptomatology but maybe the tumor has to be removed.

353
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:50,470
Of course there is a case where a tumor can be minimized or even treated

354
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:53,250
and cured through Homeopathy.

355
00:48:57,650 --> 00:49:03,970
I'm not talking about these cases where sometimes are very impressive.

356
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:10,470
Especially the women develop in the ovaries cysts

357
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:16,470
which they can become very great creating a lot of symptomatology.

358
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:22,640
And this cyst can be treated with Homeopathy and can be reduced.

359
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:24,380
But you have to know what you are treating

360
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:31,230
and whether the symptoms are from a tumor that cannot be removed or cannot be treated.

361
00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:44,620
It's interesting also that if you are dealing with Homeopathy really,

362
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:48,870
if you are really caring about the disturbances in the human body,

363
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:54,870
you will reach a point where you will be able to diagnose better

364
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:59,050
than if you did not have the knowledge of Homeopathy.

365
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:04,220
Homeopathy gives you the possibility to be a very good diagnostician

366
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:08,310
but you have to have the background to become that.

367
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:17,100
I'll just give you an example, a very interesting example.

368
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:22,000
A woman was bringing her spastic child we were treating.

369
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:25,500
I knew the woman, she had come many time with the child to be treated.

370
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:30,320
One day I saw this woman and I say what is wrong with you, there is something wrong.

371
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:40,610
She says yes but I've been examined by different doctors and they say that nothing is wrong.

372
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:43,830
But I see you are in very bad condition.

373
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:46,580
She says yes I have some fever and I have different symptomatology.

374
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,550
What are the symptoms you have?

375
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:57,980
She says I have a pain here, going back, all around my waist and extending to my thigh...

376
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:04,220
I said this is an inflammation on the right kidney, it must be a cyst inflamed

377
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:10,650
and you have to be examined it quickly. Go to the gynecologist and find out.

378
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:17,910
She went to the gynecologist and he hospitalized her immediately and operated her.

379
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:25,400
She had been to several doctors and they said nothing is wrong with you.

380
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:30,390
The pain is because you are nervous and because your child is problematic.

381
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:35,820
It's a spastic child, that's why you bring up this fever.

382
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:41,050
So Homeopathy gives her the possibility to be diagnosed better

383
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:45,070
than if she just had an allopathic knowledge.

384
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:54,970
So in case you have a mechanical dislocation, you have to deal with that

385
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:59,740
and then give again the indicated homeopathic remedy.

386
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:07,890
Another condition which can block homeopathic treatment

387
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:23,080
it is an ingested chemical on a regular basis.

388
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:31,990
Here what do we have?

389
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:39,150
For instance somebody who drinks coffee regularly, three cups the day,

390
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:40,720
you give homeopathic treatment.

391
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:46,140
It may act for some time but not for long.

392
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:50,300
The chemical which is ingested, the caffeine will bring about a relapse

393
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,980
within a period of one month, two months, three months depending of the strength

394
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:57,490
of the individual.

395
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:09,230
The person who takes drugs, any kind of drugs official or unofficial, you cannot treat...

396
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:19,160
I'm sorry, you cannot treat individuals who are taking hashish or hallucinogenic drugs.

397
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:26,890
Your remedy may act for a short period of time but the relapse is absolutely sure.

398
00:53:26,990 --> 00:53:34,900
Forget the possibility that you will say OK take this remedy and keep on with your hashish,

399
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:45,130
or LSD, or heroin and cocaine-I'm not even talking about that- these hard drugs.

400
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:51,130
I'm talking about the milder drugs that we intellectualize and say no,

401
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:55,040
this is not a habit for me, this is not, that is not...

402
00:53:55,140 --> 00:54:01,880
These drugs are quite habit forming and quite dangerous for the system

403
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:04,630
and you will see the effect. Why?

404
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:09,710
Because the moment that you give a homeopathic remedy, if it is the right one,

405
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:15,300
what it does is to bring the organism into a state of balance.

406
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:22,290
Do you understand what that is? Balance.

407
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:31,290
It is somebody who is walking on the street and keeping the balance,

408
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:34,390
neither to the left nor to the right.

409
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:42,500
If he takes drugs this person may fall down and he will stay in the ground.

410
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:49,370
Never mind how many drugs you give, after he is in the ground, it does not matter.

411
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:57,880
This is the idea. But once he is balancing there, going into a sensitive balance state,

412
00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:02,210
a little bit of chemical drugs may over take him.

413
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:08,710
And then he falls back into his sleeplessness, his sciaticas, his stomach pains etc.

414
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:12,710
Once he is in that state again, it does not matter whether he drinks one coffee

415
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:19,480
or five coffees. That chronic state of his will remain.

416
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:30,880
But once he is coming on a sensitive balance, then you have to be careful.

417
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:37,870
I remember one case with Natrum Muriaticum I have given in an intercostal neuralgia.

418
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:46,210
That was coming on a student that he was having students of mathematics in India.

419
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:51,790
He was having this attack usually when he was in the class between 10 and 12 o'clock.

420
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:56,380
Severe pain, intercostal neuralgia on the left side,

421
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:02,040
which is one of the main remedies Natrum Muriaticum together with...?

422
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:08,710
Which is the other remedy that has intercostal neuralgias mostly on the left side?

423
00:56:08,810 --> 00:56:12,390
There is a remedy which looks like Rhus tox.

424
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:22,130
Ranunculus Bulbosus. So Nat Mur and Ranun Bullb are specific.

425
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:27,890
If you want to treat intercostal neuralgia, always you give...

426
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:33,900
It won't work always, only sometimes.

427
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:38,130
This boy had Natrum Muriaticum 1M.

428
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:44,310
He did well for a few days and then suddenly the condition was back.

429
00:56:45,810 --> 00:56:51,040
He had an aggravation in the beginning, then well for a few days, then back.

430
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:56,790
That's very strange. Do you do something? Do you drink coffee? Nothing.

431
00:56:56,890 --> 00:57:04,810
I give again Nat Mur 1M, better for a few days, then the situation was back.

432
00:57:04,910 --> 00:57:09,120
So I went again to the enquiring list, what are you doing, what are your blockages,

433
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:13,210
with what you are blocking the treatment? You are doing something.

434
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:20,210
I was absolutely sure. I couldn't find nothing except from one thing.

435
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:27,810
He was washing his teeth with a menthol toothpaste.

436
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:38,810
So I said OK stop this and take for the third time Natrum Muriaticum 1M.

437
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:41,320
The boy was cured.

438
00:57:44,810 --> 00:57:50,210
From that day onwards we don't allow menthol in Natrum Muriaticum cases especially.

439
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:56,130
And you must be careful with toothpaste that have menthol,

440
00:57:56,230 --> 00:58:00,490
you have to be careful with Nat Mur cases.

441
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:31,230
Another group is certain cases that have been...

442
00:58:31,930 --> 00:58:41,630
A chemical that they took many years ago has implanted the miasmatic kind of condition

443
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:50,730
upon the organism and now before that is antidote the treatment cannot be effective.

444
00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:56,100
What do I mean?

445
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:07,410
A person who has taken for instance a lot of streptomycin or a lot of penicillin

446
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:13,130
at a certain point and from that point onwards it starts a kind of disturbance.

447
00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:17,960
You treat the case and you think this is a Sulphur case.

448
00:59:23,070 --> 00:59:27,790
You give Sulphur, it does not work, you give Arsenicum, you give Calcarea,

449
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:36,630
you give all these remedies, they do not work until you give a Penicillin 200

450
00:59:36,730 --> 00:59:43,970
or 30 to antidote the effect of Penicillin that was there 20 years ago.

451
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:51,380
Then this Penicillin opens up the case, the symptoms become cleared,

452
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:57,710
sometimes are reduced in intensity as well and then the next remedy Sulphur again

453
00:59:57,810 --> 01:00:00,060
is given and it acts.

454
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:09,630
So we have a possibility of a kind of disease of a chemical imprinting

455
01:00:09,730 --> 01:00:15,310
its own picture upon the person.

456
01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:21,060
I'll give another example. A case of asthma.

457
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:29,070
Severe asthma, you treat it very carefully, no effect with any remedy.

458
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:36,390
Then the person says I have this asthma since that flu.

459
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:48,460
We gave a dose of Influenzinum, the virus of flu, different viruses together in a remedy

460
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:54,470
which is called Influenzinum, we gave 200 and from that moment onwards

461
01:00:54,570 --> 01:01:00,660
there was an improvement and eventually a cure.

462
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:18,650
Another group on the physical level, what can be?

463
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:39,850
Permanent damages on a certain organ that cannot be corrected further.

464
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,750
I will give you an example.

465
01:01:44,850 --> 01:01:55,610
In the Down's children, the Mongolic children, we do not have a possibility of a cure.

466
01:01:55,710 --> 01:02:01,880
We do not have a possibility to bring these children into health back.

467
01:02:02,370 --> 01:02:04,540
There is a permanent damage.

468
01:02:16,050 --> 01:02:24,940
Any permanent damage on an organ will prevent the cure to be complete.

469
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:31,360
You will have an amelioration but not a cure. I will take different diseases.

470
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:34,460
For instance multiple sclerosis.

471
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:42,110
In multiple sclerosis you will have the plaques forming and these are permanent distruction

472
01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:48,500
on the nerves that cannot be replaced.

473
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:57,940
So when the inflammation takes place in the beginning, that you can correct.

474
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:01,360
The homeopathic remedy will take away the inflammation

475
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:09,030
and also the disturbance of the disease and you may have a complete cure

476
01:03:09,130 --> 01:03:12,610
if you get a multiple sclerosis case within 6 months

477
01:03:12,710 --> 01:03:17,190
or within a year from the moment it started.

478
01:03:17,290 --> 01:03:21,020
Multiple sclerosis is an up and down disease.

479
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:26,200
It appears with certain symptomatology and then it appears to be better

480
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:29,700
and then again more symptomatology and as year by year progresses,

481
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:33,210
then you see more and more permanent paralysis.

482
01:03:33,990 --> 01:03:38,200
After a few years, 5, 6 years you see the permanent paralysis

483
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:45,620
which is establishing itself in the body, then you cannot anymore treat these cases.

484
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:53,960
Don't struggle to treat cases of multiple sclerosis of 6, 7, 10 years long.

485
01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:58,280
What you will do? There is an effect yes. What is the effect?

486
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:06,360
During the inflammation there is an edema, because of the inflammation there is an edema.

487
01:04:06,460 --> 01:04:09,200
Because of the edema, there is pressure on the nerves

488
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:16,940
and there are symptoms of paralysis quite strong.

489
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:25,030
These symptoms will be reduced but whatever has happened up to the 6 years

490
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:34,210
when the plaques have formed and the nervous cells are dead, then you cannot replace them.

491
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:39,710
There is a permanent damage on a particular organ.

492
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:45,380
Another example.

493
01:04:45,910 --> 01:04:53,800
You are treating rheumatoid arthritis of 15 years standing.

494
01:04:54,300 --> 01:05:02,190
And you see the arthrosis have become deformed, they are still inflamed

495
01:05:02,290 --> 01:05:06,040
and the inflammations are going on from one arthrose to the other.

496
01:05:06,830 --> 01:05:17,700
That damage which has produced the deformity of the arthrosis, you do not expect to be reversed.

497
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,450
It is not going to be reversing.

498
01:05:19,550 --> 01:05:24,450
What you can expect is to treat the inflammation and the disturbance

499
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:28,300
and to stop the disease up to a certain point, yes.

500
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:34,450
And take the symptoms of the inflammation away, yes.

501
01:05:34,550 --> 01:05:47,200
And have the positive RA test (Rheumatoid Arthrites test) with very positive (three crosses)

502
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:50,950
You may have it to 1.

503
01:05:51,050 --> 01:05:56,390
You have the sedimentation rate which is characteristic of that disease from being very high,

504
01:05:56,490 --> 01:05:58,030
coming down.

505
01:05:58,130 --> 01:06:02,860
In the beginning actually of that disease you may see the sedimentation rate shooting up.

506
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:08,440
While the pains are going down, the sedimentation rate may go up in the first months.

507
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:10,450
Then you see it comes down.

508
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:19,030
So the inflammation can go down, the positive ra-test can go down

509
01:06:19,130 --> 01:06:25,720
but the deformities that have been formed all these years in the arthrosis will remain.

510
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:43,530
Retarded children, you will have very little space to work with.

511
01:06:43,630 --> 01:06:53,130
There is a kind of improvement but not the total improvement that we may expect.

512
01:06:55,640 --> 01:07:01,300
In cases of arteriosclerosis, very progressed arteriosclerosis,

513
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:09,950
you do not expect to clear up the system and bring back the elasticity

514
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:12,370
on the vascular system.

515
01:07:12,470 --> 01:07:19,470
To expect things like that from Homeopathy is to have the wrong expectations.

516
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:32,920
I can give you more... Vitiligo. You know vitiligo?

517
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:44,670
There is a dyschromia, the melanin goes away from the skin and becomes white.

518
01:07:46,430 --> 01:07:53,580
These are permanent changes which unless you catch them within  the first 6 months...

519
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:58,990
I've seen vitiligo to be treated and cured within the first 6 months in children especially,

520
01:07:59,090 --> 01:08:03,730
totally cured and in growns-ups also. But as soon as it starts.

521
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:09,660
Give it a time and then it spreads and while it spreads, you can do nothing.

522
01:08:10,410 --> 01:08:14,080
You can only arrest it, not cured it.

523
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:21,410
It is good for the homeopathic practitioner to know these things.

524
01:08:22,830 --> 01:08:29,990
To be able to give the right information to the patient.

525
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:33,230
You will say yes I can arrest, I can help you with the pains

526
01:08:33,330 --> 01:08:38,420
but I cannot reverse the deformities that took place.

527
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:56,860
And then you have another group of cases where they come with a general weakness,

528
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:01,170
undefined general weakness of the physical body.

529
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:09,560
Great weakness of the physical body without much symptomatology

530
01:09:09,660 --> 01:09:14,680
will indicate a weak defense mechanism that is not producing symptoms,

531
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:18,500
it is not giving you out symptoms to guide you as to the right remedy.

532
01:09:19,090 --> 01:09:22,990
So what you see is weakness, weakness, weakness...

533
01:09:23,090 --> 01:09:34,830
These cases can also be produced by a lot of wrong homeopathic treatment.

534
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:39,730
By giving too many remedies for too long periods of time.

535
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:45,390
Finally instead of improving your patient, you leave your patient

536
01:09:45,490 --> 01:09:52,140
with a kind of general total weakness that he complains all the time.

537
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:56,480
He will say I used to have some pains but now I don't have.

538
01:09:56,580 --> 01:09:58,750
But now I'm more weak.

539
01:09:59,290 --> 01:10:09,340
That means that the disease now is on a deeper level and it's very difficult to treat such cases.

540
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:33,230
These are more or less the groups of people that you will find difficulty in treating.

541
01:10:33,330 --> 01:10:39,900
Now what you will do with these last group of cases.

542
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,150
You have to be very careful.

543
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:45,570
If this group comes as a result of homeopathic treatment,

544
01:10:45,670 --> 01:10:51,160
I saw many such cases in Europe 20 years ago.

545
01:10:51,670 --> 01:10:54,560
In 1965 I was in Europe treating some people there

546
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:58,400
and I saw cases treated by French homeopaths.

547
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:12,310
They came to me with prescriptions of 50 drugs taken for the last 2-3 years every day.

548
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:16,530
It just leaves them in a state of weakness that no other symptom

549
01:11:16,630 --> 01:11:19,130
is available for you to prescribe.

550
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:29,810
In these cases the best thing is not to prescribe and to take away the prescriptions.

551
01:11:31,060 --> 01:11:36,450
Take away the homeopathic prescriptions, not to prescribe and wait if they have the time.

552
01:11:36,550 --> 01:11:42,200
Now these people if they have to wait, they will start having pains and discomforts etc.

553
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:50,230
Then you have to wait long enough as to see clearly what is the next indicated remedy.

554
01:12:10,810 --> 01:12:15,530
If this person complains about weakness but he has not taken homeopathic drugs,

555
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:24,460
usually the case will be by taking with some allopathic drugs.

556
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:26,190
It has come to that state of weakness.

557
01:12:26,290 --> 01:12:34,860
He takes some pain killers, he takes some laxatives, he takes something for his heart,

558
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:41,190
he takes something for his blood pressure and by taking all these drugs leaves him

559
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:45,210
in a state of weakness.

560
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:54,390
I wanted to speak about the defense mechanism a little bit, how I understand it.

561
01:12:54,490 --> 01:13:01,060
The defense mechanism is what we have,

562
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:05,740
the most valuable thing we have within our bodies.

563
01:13:07,490 --> 01:13:11,740
The defense mechanism will tell me walk!

564
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:22,390
I have to satisfy that. Otherwise I'm going to have a stiffness in my neck.

565
01:13:22,490 --> 01:13:25,490
Then you have to do this.

566
01:13:25,990 --> 01:13:32,320
Your defense says do this. This is good defense.

567
01:13:32,830 --> 01:13:39,100
The defense will say wait, don't move because the sciatic nerve is affected.

568
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:41,390
Don't move, don't move and you don't move.

569
01:13:41,490 --> 01:13:44,080
This is good defense.

570
01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:54,300
What you do is just sit slowly, you sit there, ah it is relieved.

571
01:13:54,400 --> 01:14:00,630
Sitting relieves, then you have symptoms, you develop symptoms, you give out symptoms.

572
01:14:00,730 --> 01:14:05,600
Your defenses are in good condition.

573
01:14:10,690 --> 01:14:19,590
You have very little of inflammation on your toe, you may not be able to move.

574
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:23,660
Good defense.

575
01:14:24,150 --> 01:14:31,470
Your defense also can produce much stronger symptoms

576
01:14:31,570 --> 01:14:40,940
which maybe they don't look so good but still is to protect you.

577
01:14:42,660 --> 01:14:50,470
But if you damage this defense system, then you will have no symptoms at all

578
01:14:50,570 --> 01:14:54,350
except of one and that will be weakness.

579
01:14:55,590 --> 01:15:00,090
This is what we get in AIDS today.

580
01:15:00,190 --> 01:15:07,890
That is why it is very difficult to treat AIDS people because what they will say weak, weak...

581
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:16,230
their defenses have been broken down completely by bombardment of the drugs

582
01:15:16,330 --> 01:15:19,730
and they don't give out symptomatology.

583
01:15:22,660 --> 01:15:26,720
That's why AIDS cases are going to be very...

584
01:15:26,820 --> 01:15:31,490
This is the group where AIDS comes, weakness.

585
01:15:31,590 --> 01:15:38,560
You will see the main symptom, weakness. What else? Nothing else.

586
01:15:38,660 --> 01:15:46,760
I took a case last year in America and my students in America

587
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:51,780
have dealt with certain of these cases so far.

588
01:15:52,530 --> 01:16:00,420
Everyone has no symptomatology, the only thing is weakness, tremendous weakness.

589
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:07,680
They feel weak but the defense mechanism does not produce symptoms.

590
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:13,520
They don't suffer, they just feel weak and more weak and they die.

591
01:16:15,530 --> 01:16:23,260
All they produce is an inflammation which is a kind of pneumonia which takes them away.

592
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:26,690
The defenses are not able to cope with this situation.

593
01:16:27,690 --> 01:16:34,180
We are going to be facing with such cases of that group more and more

594
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:40,680
and these are one of the worst type of group that we'd like to see in homeopathic practice.

595
01:16:40,780 --> 01:16:50,440
I don't care if somebody is coming with excessively dangerous symptomatology.

596
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:57,520
I wouldn't mind to treat that case and to show results and to show effect.

597
01:16:58,040 --> 01:17:06,430
A person who is collapsing, who is in a coma, he still has symptoms.

598
01:17:06,530 --> 01:17:10,520
A person with weakness, no symptoms.

599
01:17:11,030 --> 01:17:14,780
Such cases are going to be very difficult to cure.

600
01:17:18,030 --> 01:17:23,180
This is the worst group from the physical blockages and this is the group

601
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:27,370
that I believe AIDS belongs.

602
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:34,350
In spite of the fact Homeopathy I believe, in spite of all that Homeopathy

603
01:17:34,450 --> 01:17:39,850
will be the best way of treating AIDS because Homeopathy does exactly

604
01:17:39,950 --> 01:17:41,600
what these people need.

605
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:47,180
Stimulates the immune system, the defense system.

606
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:51,180
Homeopathy does exactly what these people need.

607
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:58,020
And I believe that we can have with Homeopathy a result of 30-40% of these cases.

608
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:00,770
These cases are going now all to death.

609
01:18:00,870 --> 01:18:08,300
Now we have stages. They classified all these people, stage 1, stage 2, stage 3.

610
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:11,890
The stage 3 they die, all of them.

611
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:21,730
From these people I believe a percentage of 30% may be saved for quite some years

612
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:29,820
with of Homeopathy. Because Homeopathy helps the immune system to recover.
