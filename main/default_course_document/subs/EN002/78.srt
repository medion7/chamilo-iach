1
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:42,855
Generally the patients are painless in Opium cases. I've seen 12 cases of Opium, they are sensitive to pain.

2
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:51,100
But along with that they also have this peculiar intolerance to certain heavy pain but they can bear it.

3
00:00:54,150 --> 00:01:08,616
-What happened with this girl it is not only that I based the presciption in what you wrote.

4
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:20,335
Because, if I remember well, you wrote that this girl can really tolerate the pain but the pain is felt.

5
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:34,280
And she actually tells her mother and aunt how painful it was. But at the moment she could not express it.

6
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:55,775
Opium in a state, I have said, maybe I confuse the groups; maybe I have not said to this group.

7
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:04,965
Did I tell you that each remedy has levels? I said it in this group?

8
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,805
-No.

9
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:14,805
-Levels of health, like the organism has levels of health.

10
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:34,065
It seems that I'm half out of my body because I'm jerking with this noise.

11
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:39,130
So be careful because if I'm out of my body I read your minds.

12
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,640
They call it intuition, nevermind what they call it.

13
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:13,985
I will talk about the levels of remedies.
And then I come back to Opium.

14
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:25,715
Each remedy has certain levels on which can be acting.

15
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:39,000
For instance Calcarea carbonica can be acting in level 1, it can be acting in level 8 or 9.

16
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:53,593
The symptoms will be different. In level 1 Calcarea carbonica will be a person who is feeling very cold

17
00:03:53,693 --> 00:04:04,150
feet are cold, desires sweets, desires eggs, perspires in the occiput.

18
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:18,000
In level 9,10 Calcarea carbonica will be there but all these keynotes will not be there.

19
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:35,005
Some idea of the keynotes may be there. That means you may have a tumor, you may have a cancer and in the cancer case

20
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:46,790
you may have some.... even the feeling of coldness will not be there.

21
00:04:47,730 --> 00:05:13,140
The desire for eggs may not exist but there will be other symptoms, especially if the effect is on the mental or neurological level.

22
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:28,349
Then you don't have to have the symptoms. For instance Calcarea carbonica level 7, you have already fear of insanity.

23
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:39,115
Fear of insanity quite strongly. Anxiety about health quite strong. Fear of death quite strong.

24
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:48,845
So these fears you will not have in group 1 but you will have the other keynotes.

25
00:05:53,160 --> 00:06:13,680
Another example. Phosphorus has fear of thunderstorm, thirst, great thirst, desires ice-cream, cold, upper group.

26
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:28,190
You go on mental-emotional level the thirst is gone, no thirst, no fear of thunderstorm.

27
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:49,250
But it has increased very much the sensitivity to pain from others. They cannot tolerate at all pain around them.

28
00:06:52,880 --> 00:07:10,095
The sensitivity is so great that cannot go out and see people suffering at all. They remain closed in their places. They don't go out.

29
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:20,240
In this stage all the main keynotes of Phosphorus will be gone.

30
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:49,510
In Opium case, the typical Opium case would have been that opiates, will be produced in the brain and make you feel no pain.

31
00:07:51,410 --> 00:08:04,155
Like when you are in a stress, in a situation that you may have a broken arm, leg and feel no pain.

32
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:13,005
That moment there is a flood of opiates, that makes you feel no pain.

33
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:26,310
The shock of the organism creates a defense, a lot of opiates that flood the areas of the brain and you feel no pain.

34
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:34,515
Later on when the shock is over, then the pain starts.

35
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:48,160
So we say Opium in the upper group, they don't feel the pain. They don't feel the pain, not they suppress the pain.

36
00:08:50,080 --> 00:09:15,755
But the main problem for me was that immobility of the nervous system, total sleep of the peripheral nervous system

37
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:35,205
it was not moving at all. The bladder, paralyis. It was not so much the typical tolerance of pain that we know in Opium.

38
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:46,495
Because when you wrote to me, you wrote that she is not tolerating she is suppressing the pain and later on

39
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:53,840
 she would admit the situation
 was very painful. You remember?

40
00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:14,450
But mostly lead me to this the idea of the effect of Opium. Because Opium we say is one of the main remedies in constipation.

41
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:30,000
So that means constipation which is due to a paralysis, there are no the peristaltic movements of the colon.

42
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:51,780
Bryonia has also constipation but is due to dryness. The glands do not give out enough liquid, mucus.

43
00:10:54,050 --> 00:11:16,620
Opium is this. Also Opium is somebody who seems to be quite patient.

44
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:38,135
Especially in pneumonia, they're lying down there, the lungs are full of water, there is cough, you expect they feel something.

45
00:11:39,320 --> 00:12:00,520
They go into a state of ecstasy, kind of. We give Opium when we see somebody into a comatose state.

46
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:14,765
That means they don't feel. Why they don't feel? Because of certain reactions on the body, right?

47
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:21,597
And then we give Opium and we see
it's coming out of the comatose state.

48
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:37,680
That is the idea that led me to Opium in this lady.
But really I don't know why I said 2 months.

49
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:43,720
No, no I tell you the truth.

50
00:12:49,480 --> 00:13:03,365
She had some reactions which I evaluated as correct reactions. So I knew if she had these reactions the effect is going to be sure.

51
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:10,880
So I said wait 2 months. Because you kept
 on writing all the time. Give a remedy.

52
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:26,880
But at certain point the reactions were such that
I said, ok 2,3 months she will be much better.

53
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:40,601
-How necessary is the keynote sleepiness in Opium? If you don't have sleepiness?

54
00:13:40,701 --> 00:13:52,712
-Sleepiness is one of the uppermost levels. Later on when the nervous system is affected you don't have it anymore.

55
00:13:54,280 --> 00:14:04,424
Also this is something which I have seen many times with novice, with people who come and know very little about Homeopathy.

56
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:14,150
They say, how you give Phosphorus she
 does not have fear of thunderstorm

57
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:25,910
or how you give Nitric acid if she does not have cuts.... .

58
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:37,005
It depends on the level of the remedy, what level you are treating and when we describe remedies,

59
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:43,365
we describe remedies on the upper levels
where the remedy is clear.

60
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:55,405
In the lower levels the remedy is not clear anymore. You have to "smell" the remedy in the lower levels.

61
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:04,800
You have to perceive even little changes
 which look like the remedy.

62
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:21,885
In the lower levels of health when somebody is seriously ill, you do not have a typical picture as we describe it usually.

63
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,640
When we describe the remedy.

64
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:32,095
It's very strange, I remember a case that
 you may not even remember.

65
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:51,160
When you brought me this case of businessman, 38-40, with duodenal ulcer. Natrum muriaticum, yes?

66
00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:08,065
-Certain diseases like diabetes etc. which have genetic predisposition, is it possible to modify the genetic predisposition

67
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:15,045
of the next generation if the mother takes
other medicine during the pregnancy time?

68
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:27,645
- There is quite a lot possibility of improving the health of the child if the mother takes in time correct homeopathic treatment.

69
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:37,015
It's not a matter of, I took Homeopathy. It's a matter, of: did you take the correct sequence of remedies?

70
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:45,095
If you have taken a lot of homeopathic remedies you may stay just at the same way as you were 10 years ago.

71
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:54,585
So the idea is, did the mother get correct homeopathic treatment? The child is going to be born much healthier.

72
00:16:54,660 --> 00:17:04,825
That's why I suggest that all pregnant women should have homeopathic treatment.

73
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,400
But not the wrong treatment.

74
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:16,565
-What about the father?
-The father as well, oh yes.

75
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:30,515
You have to remember we
participate in the game.

76
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:46,820
Now you don't need. You go to the bank
 and say give me a sperm, how much?

77
00:17:50,173 --> 00:18:04,850
I know children have been born with sperm of unknown parents. They show the picture, oh yes good guy, give me his sperm.

78
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:20,725
It's a big issue. In India they don't need yet,
but I tell you a prediction for India.

79
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:31,940
Especially for the effluent society of India. They are going to have such problem quite soon.

80
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:47,200
In 20, 30 years all rich people of India will
have women with sterility, quite a lot.

81
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:02,465
-Because they are adopting a
western style of life and diet.

82
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:10,975
-Exactly. Diet and treatment especially.
Diet, treatment and freedom.

83
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:30,215
That is the worst I can tell you. Because they contract all kinds of venereal kind of diseases

84
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:42,620
that have a direct effect upon the
reproductive system, genito-urinary system.

85
00:19:43,731 --> 00:20:01,600
Because of infections which are spreading like fire now in Africa, in India, in China and God knows what.

86
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:20,795
-I'd like to ask a question about placebo effect. Do you think is the vital force which is actually producing

87
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:29,400
the placebo effect or do you think it's something else? If it is the vital force, have you seen patterns of symptoms?

88
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:42,645
-I tell you what is my opinion about placebo. Placebo effect has a mechanism of how it is produced.

89
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:56,485
In Homeopathy we use the same mechanism exactly. We stimulate the organism as the same way exactly

90
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:11,935
is stimulated by the person himself by his belief that now I'm going to get better. So the mechanism is the same.

91
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:26,500
What is the difference? The difference is that the stimulation by the person himself can have a limited effect. Up to here.

92
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:38,965
That means you will feel better 1,2,3 weeks. 4 weeks has a relapse, faith is gone, effect is gone.

93
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:48,325
Here we have the possibility to raise the potency and to stimulate more and more and therefore

94
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:59,405
we have cases in which we can confirm that this is in fact because of the remedy. Why?

95
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:09,855
Because all symptoms come back. Because skin eruptions are coming out again, because diseases are going

96
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:14,585
from up, downwards.

97
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:25,125
We know that this is the effect of the remedy. We do not see this effect on the placebo.

98
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:39,085
But now if the person though is suffering very much belongs to the group 1, level 1,2,3 it can be

99
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:44,600
completely cured through a self-suggestion.

100
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:58,840
Completely, it's gone because he was quite healthy already. So whatever you give him they say, I gave him Aluminium...

101
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:08,700
whatever, you just give it to him and it will affect him.

102
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:22,455
And that is why a lot of homeopaths don't realise that when they give a remedy made by the machine

103
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:37,595
or when they give a remedy which they think it contains something, a peculiar remedy whatever it might be

104
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:49,845
and then they report in the journals that I have such a case and I gave this remedy and the person was cured.

105
00:23:51,920 --> 00:24:04,620
Just simple placebo effect or insincerity.

106
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:21,340
Not sincere report because the person may have said, 'I was better for 1 week-10 days' and you reported, he was well.

107
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:41,445
-In these people in the top levels...I treated yoga therapy including the 12 tissue salts the usual yoga thing,

108
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:51,285
all the yoga diet as well at many cures. But then I saw people on the lower levels and I had to send them to a homeopath.

109
00:24:51,360 --> 00:25:00,225
But the cures with these very healthy people it might the yoga therapy worked for real because it's what they needed.

110
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:05,215
-Yes, they needed very little stimulation and they are better.

111
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:11,445
-I have a question in continuation of a discussion this morning regarding when you go at ascending potencies

112
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,285
and for example, give 200 there is no effect
1 million there is no effect and so on.

113
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:23,735
What if you're giving not a similium remedy but very close remedy. And you continue doing it and

114
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:30,824
you don't see effect and so on. At one moment you get 10M and you have an aggravation.

115
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:36,315
-No amelioration.
-No amelioration, it's really aggravation. How do you know is it really

116
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:47,735
aggravation, is it similar aggravation, what are your guidelines to see if you're on the right track?

117
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:56,005
-Your guidelines would be that a strong aggravation could not last very long. After a few days,

118
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:03,195
he must report I am much better. If he does not do that, that means there is an aggravation

119
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:14,205
 which continues it's his disease which is aggravated. An aggravation is good and therefore

120
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:19,965
 has to give an effect after the aggravation.
Aggravation is not good because of the aggravation.

121
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:25,555
 It's good because after the aggravation he must be well.

122
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:30,315
If he is not well....this is the guiding.

123
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:38,295
-But you actually give already quite high level of remedy.

124
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:46,125
If you give already10M and there is no effect first and then it's getting 10M and there is aggravation.

125
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,785
And it lasts not 1,2 days, it lasts a week. What you do next?

126
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:56,840
-You wait. The 8th day he will be good.

127
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:09,600
Like his case, in 2 months he will be alright.

128
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:23,705
-A question about the potencies. As far as I remember Kent made this rule from 30, 200, 1M, 10M, 50 M.

129
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:33,455
You give some potencies like 31, 32 and this was really puzzling me somehow.

130
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:43,045
-It's a matter of experience, out of many, many, thousands of people I have seen. I have seen that sometimes

131
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:53,765
 I had to repeat not to go jump from 30 to 200. But if I went slowly up it would be better

132
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,750
especially when I had serious conditions.

133
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:08,005
-I was just thinking of a man who was getting much better with Lycopodium 1M and he has a continuous

134
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:16,315
 infection of the bladder with blood in the urine and he has also stones, little, little stones in the urine.

135
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:22,655
-A case here you are talking?
-No, a case at home one of my patients.

136
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:27,965
-You gave Lycopodium.
-The only thing that had an effect was Lycopodium.

137
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:44,200
Lycopodium 1M and I was in doubt to give it so high because he has infection with HIV that could lead to AIDS later.

138
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:52,470
I don't want to damage his life forcing too much by giving him the next step from 1M to 10M.

139
00:28:53,240 --> 00:29:07,740
So I repeated Lycopodium 1M but has no effect and I looked for other keynotes and I came always back to Lycopodium.

140
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:13,760
-You never tried higher. You couldn't damage him.

141
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:20,405
-No. How do you know?
-How do I know?

142
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,165
I don't know.

143
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:36,805
-Is the possiblity to give 1M and one more?
Like 1001M.

144
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:46,255
-Yes, 1001 you could do it and then you tell me the results.

145
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:48,415
-Yes ok.

146
00:29:48,490 --> 00:30:00,560
-Because that is how we learn. People like you who are afraid, they try this or that, then they give me feedback  and then I learn.

147
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:11,495
What can I say? If I knew your case, you say it's an AIDS case. If he is positive in HIV.

148
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:27,080
-He has not a clinical AIDS related complex but he is a carrier.

149
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:42,305
-I would like to ask about juvenile diabetes,
 if you have made any conclusions about possible factors

150
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:53,485
that have created this disease in children? And if there are some emotional common elements in these children?

151
00:30:53,920 --> 00:31:00,845
-No, I have not made such observations. I have not seen too many cases either.

152
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:11,245
-Just to come back to the Opium case. I'm still not clear about the particular symptom when

153
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:17,375
she was sensitive to the pain but was not able to express it.

154
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:29,445
-I did not base my prescription to that. Mahesh said that this was the reason, he made it up.

155
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:42,295
When I remember the real facts he sent me it was not that. Mostly I based my prescription on the fact

156
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:51,820
that was paralysed all the system. But he made
 it sound differently than the reality a little bit.

157
00:31:53,400 --> 00:32:11,815
-Last days we had two patients with thyroxine hormones for metabolism. Could you comment something

158
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:19,705
upon patients taking these hormones? Does it influence when you treat with Homeopathy

159
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:27,925
  or can they continue regardless of these hormones?

160
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:42,175
-Hormones which are missing out of an organ, for instance sometimes you have a total extraction

161
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:54,605
of thyroid and a replacement with thyroxine. In this case this problem does not prevent you from giving a remedy.

162
00:32:54,680 --> 00:33:10,525
 Neither insulin is preventing you from giving a remedy because it's a substance which replaces the normal output of an organ.

163
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:22,845
If this is a replacement then it does not matter, you don't have to say stop it. You can give, you can go ahead and give the remedy.

164
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:30,325
If the organism is missing the organ all together, of course you don't expect that the organ will grow again

165
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:42,640
but the whole organism will be in a better condition. But they have to continue with thyroxine.

166
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:53,595
You can be treating such cases and can be quite deep cases and you improve them.

167
00:33:53,670 --> 00:34:05,080
But the thyroxine will always be there. You will give thyroxine, you have to replace what cannot be produced.

168
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:17,855
-One of my friends wants to ask a question, she is afraid. So I'll ask the question.

169
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:30,725
She wants to know the effect of infertility treatment, allopathic infertility treatment, the effect in the woman

170
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,495
 and the child and the next generation,
how it manifests?

171
00:34:45,060 --> 00:35:04,390
-The effect of artificial insemination,
treatment or the drugs?

172
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:22,160
It's a difficult subject and I don't have enough information to tell you what happens in the chilldren.

173
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:35,865
But according to my theories of the children of love, you know this theory?

174
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:55,475
I have out of some observation and talking with a lot of parents and seen their children, noticed many times

175
00:35:55,550 --> 00:36:04,405
the first child of the family is very sick, a lot of problems. The second child is quite healthy.

176
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:10,310
 Or the opposite, the first child is very healthy,
the second child, the third child, very sick.

177
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:27,245
I used to ask the parents what was the condition of conception time for this particular child?

178
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:37,845
And what was the difference between the first child that was conceived in a state of love,

179
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:49,075
you know the first love how powerful it is?
The first love affair is fantastic.

180
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:56,325
 If a child is born under this condition, is going to be a complete child. A complete human being.

181
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:09,640
 That means a human being which will have .... these are signs that I should not talk about this subject.

182
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:36,290
Anyhow I don't listen to such signals to my detriment.

183
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:52,895
I will give you some examples so you may understand. My theory is when two young people are first in love

184
00:37:52,970 --> 00:38:10,045
and then they come together to have sex and with this force and energy is so powerful that what happens is

185
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:19,645
that each one has given up his ego. And they can merge to each other.

186
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:32,895
This merging of the two people due to the love they have for each other, this merging makes the ego disappear.

187
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:47,205
And therefore complete connection is there. If there is a complete connection, you have a child who is born

188
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:55,955
as complete as possible. That means with the best possible qualities from the mother and from the father.

189
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:16,285
Of course the perfect child is not born yet. The absolute, perfect child but you know young people can fall in love

190
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:30,085
much more easy than older people who say, 'ah I know'. That state is terrilbe if you overuse it especially.

191
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:45,365
First time is very powerful the connection and then the quality of the sperm is different.

192
00:39:45,440 --> 00:40:00,136
You have a quality of sperm which is different than when somebody goes to masturbate to take some sperm and inseminate etc.

193
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:03,535
So this is my theory.

194
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:19,455
The moment that you have lost your ego consciousness, then you are in touch with the cosmos;

195
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:30,285
that's why people who are in love they come together and they feel, 'oh my god what an experience!'

196
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:41,765
That experience is a spiritual experience. It's similar than the experience the yogis are looking for.

197
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:56,765
You know common people are given the possibility to live the state of complete consciousness,

198
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:07,320
 of enlightment, whatever you call it, during the time when two people in love come together and they have sex together.

199
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:23,270
 That is the highest point. If a child is conceived during that state, is going to be a child complete,

200
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:46,285
 is going to be happy, satisfied with whatever he has. But usually the society says, the woman is 19, you are too young,

201
00:41:46,360 --> 00:42:02,250
 you cannot have a child at this age. You are the shame of our family, you must go and have, you know what I mean.

202
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:17,235
This child is gone, another child is gone, third child is gone and then the woman is studying, she becomes a scientist.

203
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:29,805
Now she has to marry. She will find somebody to marry who has certain requisites, certain parameters.

204
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:37,725
He has to be a bank manager, a doctor in the hospital, a lawyer bla, bla, bla.

205
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:52,445
This is a concession already that has taken away the idea of total love. It's gone.
You cannot do it anymore.

206
00:42:52,520 --> 00:43:02,165
Because you enter logic into the factors and therefore you cannot.

207
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:16,845
But in India they have arranged marriage. Arranged marriage means people do not know each other;

208
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:30,930
they meet almost one week before marriage. The first child is going to have a problem if the attraction is not immediate.

209
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:38,665
But now what happens, because of the Indian tradition they decide we have to live our life together

210
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:42,545
 and they start loving each other.

211
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:52,215
The more they live together after a year, two years the second child comes, then love has developed.

212
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:56,530
The second child is going to be better than the first one.

213
00:43:56,756 --> 00:44:06,415
On the contrary if the woman says, no I love this man and he loves me and I will marry him.

214
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:16,685
They go ahead and marry. The first child will be in better position than later on when they are used to each other

215
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:34,605
you know, let's do it and bla, bla, bla is becoming habitual. The moment sex becomes habitual the sperm is missing the information.

216
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:44,625
You will not believe it but the sperm gets all the information you are giving at the moment of conception.

217
00:44:46,160 --> 00:45:00,565
What you think, what you feel, the most nice feelings, the most ideal feelings, the most sublime feelings

218
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:05,065
 they are given to the child.

219
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:24,485
But you may say, ok the woman will ovulate two days later and then the conception will take place.

220
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:35,995
It doesn't matter; the woman also has given the qualities to the ovum. She has given the qualities of herself as she has

221
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:52,825
given in this connection. And I'm sure that if they can use the sperm of those who are in love during the sexual

222
00:45:52,900 --> 00:46:03,005
contact and use the same sperm when people are just masturbating and get it, they will see a difference

223
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:11,200
if they can examine the sperm in its very subtle consistency.

224
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:20,885
I say this because this is going to be proved about 30 years later but it will be written there.

225
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:37,565
Therefore if you have ideas like these I have, if you ask me if artificial insemination is a good thing

226
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:55,730
I will say well it is concession, it is a compromise.
It is not the perfect thing. What could be really a perfect situation.

227
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:05,400
Crazy ideas.

228
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:24,225
-Can you tell us your experience on treating obese patients?

229
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:27,045
-Treating obesity?

230
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:49,805
Sometimes you will have some good effect if the assimilation is not good, the absorption is not good

231
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:57,975
is not correct with the remedy being corrected, you may have an effect. But treating very obese people like

232
00:47:58,050 --> 00:48:22,655
the one I saw 457 kilos! About that big. 35 old.
In America you see quite a lot of them.

233
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:33,045
I doubt whether we can do really something
 about it. I really very much doubt.

234
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:38,110
The organism I think is totally destroyed, the immune system.
