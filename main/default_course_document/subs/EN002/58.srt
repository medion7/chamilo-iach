1
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:40,450
This is a type of a reaction which many times is coming to your office; that is a correct reaction in the beginning.

2
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:50,000
Short aggravation, amelioration,
 then he comes after a month and says,

3
00:00:50,100 --> 00:01:01,690
'I was better but the last week or the last
days I feel back the symptoms'.

4
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,580
What happens in these cases is that the initial reaction  is so good and the patient feels very
well,

5
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:35,700
the day after or 2-3 days after.
He feels oh my god that's like a miracle

6
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:50,700
   and then they go into a state of euphoria. But after a few days or weeks

7
00:01:50,800 --> 00:02:00,540
they start getting back a little bit of the symptoms; they get into a panic state thinking that the whole thing

8
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:12,470
 is back and they will pressurize you for
 giving another dose or another remedy.

9
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:20,710
 You have to be very careful because if
you start giving another remedy, forget it.

10
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:31,040
 The moment that the reaction was correct in the beginning it does not matter that they complain

11
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:44,500
as long as there is no full relapse they can complain and they may even go into hysterics

12
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,530
if you tell them I don't give you another medicine.

13
00:02:50,790 --> 00:03:05,190
You see how bad they were in the beginning? Now they say, I feel 10%, 20% worse, no medicine, wait, give placebo.

14
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:18,250
Otherwise you will spoil 100% the case, if you repeat the same remedy yes. Even with the same remedy,

15
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:25,220
you may be lucky and no spoil the case
 but you don't go by luck you go by law.

16
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:36,880
And the law says, you should wait
otherwise your luck will finish one day.

17
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,400
Patient after patient will come
back and say, I'm not well.

18
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:53,640
The idea is that you will see the patient after a year or two years becoming really better.

19
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:04,390
Not make them better the next day. I have this headache, give me a medicine so my headache will go away.

20
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:11,960
 No, take an aspirin if the law says you
must take an aspirin, take an aspirin.

21
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:27,710
This case is happening quite frequently, the people feel so good, the feeling is exactly like
 the one who gets

22
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:35,950
out of prison and the first days he enjoys freedom and says, my god I can go here and there.

23
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:47,060
After a few weeks he gets used to it. We don't appreciate freedom because we have not being in jail.

24
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:56,040
 The same way he will start not appreciating the fact that he is well now and the least thing will bother him.

25
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:09,660
And the organism cannot stay in a straight line, you get back the organism and the organism stays like that.

26
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:21,960
No because there are stresses all the time; so the organism will fluctuate, it cannot be perfection for ever.

27
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:38,710
Therefore with the stress and especially if you get a little bit hysterical persons they can create by themselves

28
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:49,430
symptoms or augment the symptoms, increase the symptoms. And then you are forced,

29
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:55,700
take the remedy and then no effect.

30
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:04,520
This case, never mind how much you may repeat there will be no effect because there is no real relapse.

31
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:17,260
In this case you just either give placebo, placebo, placebo, I'm better, I'm better, I'm still better. Are you back? No.

32
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:29,900
Ok I'll give you a good medicine, give placebo, one month, 2nd month,20 months, 25 months until you will

33
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:37,080
realize that there are symptoms of a new remedy, then you give.

34
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:49,110
-I was wondering if these instances...I have experience with a patient who has done, she said, miraculously well

35
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:57,860
and after about two and a half months,
symptoms begun to slowly return.

36
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:07,500
 My thought at that time was that the remedy had exhausted and I repeated it the same remedy

37
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:15,070
slightly higher potency, no response at all and the symptoms continued to get worse and worse, again repeated

38
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:19,870
little higher thinking that the potency was not high enough, again the same symptoms continued

39
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:28,180
to get worse and then I
started giving different remedies.

40
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:40,640
-That is a usual story where you start
spoiling your case in this way.

41
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:49,100
-How do you differentiate between when the remedy is getting thin and exhausted and symptoms

42
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:56,360
begin to return and when they are at this
 level, how do you distinguish that?

43
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:10,870
-There are different ways. One way is that you have certain keynotes of the remedy on which you have prescribed.

44
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:22,780
Let's take one of the cases we saw with Medorrhinum, she said I had sensitive soles and the sensitivity

45
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:27,360
is not there anymore. Then placebo, placebo.

46
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:43,520
Then one day she says, I have my complains and the keynote is back. That is the time where you can repeat the remedy.

47
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:54,550
The keynote on which you had prescribed originally and which was minimized or gone during the treatment,

48
00:08:54,650 --> 00:09:00,390
it comes back that's the time you can prescribe the remedy and it will have an effect.

49
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,890
-Higher potency?

50
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:19,300
-The same potency first and then higher. Now there is another case in which you will see the whole case is back

51
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:35,980
and if the relapse is 85 %... But if she says, I'm 80% back but the two keynotes on which you have prescribed

52
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:51,360
originally are not back, be careful. Don't repeat that remedy. If the keynotes are not back don't repeat the remedy.

53
00:09:51,460 --> 00:10:04,540
That means I'm 80% back without the keynotes of the remedy, it means most probably it needs another remedy.

54
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:15,660
 Try to find another remedy. We do have some laws, some principles on which we go along.

55
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:25,640
 The problem is that even myself which
I'm teaching you I make this mistake when I'm pressurized by the patient;

56
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,790
 You are going to make the mistake,
you are going to fall under this condition.

57
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:39,680
That's why I told you when Bill Gray left the patients, the patients could not say, I have a little headache, this, that.

58
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:52,110
He came after a year, I'm very well, of course because he left them alone with the remedy to act.

59
00:10:53,370 --> 00:11:05,510
Get away from the idea: whatever you have, you take a remedy. Because I have seen cases where

60
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:18,700
you have a little accident and there is a little bruise, oh take Arnica, take Arnica. This is wrong, let the organism.

61
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:27,080
You have to be black all over and really have a shock and things like that and then you take Arnica.

62
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:38,770
A splinter is painful, 'oh I take Ledum', no.
This is not good for Homeopathy.

63
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:52,530
A little cold, my nose is running, let it run. Why? You don't have a picture of the remedy if your nose is running.

64
00:11:52,630 --> 00:12:03,700
What are you going to take Allium cepa, Arsenicum, Natrum muriaticum, Thuja?

65
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:10,790
 All these remedies they have nose running. Fluoric acid is running like a tap.

66
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:23,960
When you have that, you may think of Fluoric acid. In that case, this is very frequent case,

67
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:30,410
and it is unfortunate if you prescribe and
you spoil such a case.

68
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:44,310
If the case is doing much better, I'm 10%, I'm getting 20%, 30 % back. You say wait, wait, give placebo,

69
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:50,810
don't worry, it's not going to come back when
he has this reaction, is not going to come back.

70
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:57,540
-Can you please explain what happens in the organism if you repeat the remedy too quickly?

71
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:06,130
 In the beginning you gave the body a kind
of surge so it can start the curing process;

72
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:12,780
if you then repeat the remedy too soon one
 could say that the body gets another surge

73
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:18,060
to continue the healing process but this time
it doesn't work anymore but what I don't understand

74
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,490
is why it doesn't work this time?

75
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:35,400
-Because we don't have the original picture of the disease. That means we have a partial picture of the disease,

76
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:44,300
the remedy partially fits the case. Therefore it's a remedy which is close to the case and not exact.

77
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:49,160
 Therefore it's going to have an effect because
 it is close to the case but not exact,

78
00:13:49,750 --> 00:14:04,880
 So it's going to have an effect but the effect is not going to be curative, it's going to be disruptive.

79
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:26,260
It is a different thing when you don't have this reaction in levels here when you repeat every day and it's getting

80
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:37,250
a little bit better and a little bit better and the more you repeat the more better it comes. You don't have the reaction.

81
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:42,840
 Once you have that reaction,
don't touch the case.

82
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:50,620
It is different when it comes
down to other levels of pathology.

83
00:14:50,720 --> 00:15:04,060
There you may have to repeat
in order to promote health.

84
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:14,540
That means the organism stays on that remedy and needs every day a push or three times
 the day a push,

85
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:20,970
until it really brings out a reaction.

86
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:36,700
-This situation what is the best way to handle? Having made the mistake, what is the best way to handle the case

87
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:43,700
 from that time on? Acknowledging that the first remedy was correct, we had this reaction

88
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:50,290
and then the case was disrupted, what we do?

89
00:15:51,310 --> 00:16:07,140
-The best way is to continue with placebo. Forget about the remedy and it will come back. It's like
 a proving.

90
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:17,340
But if you start, oh I made a mistake, another remedy, another remedy, eventually you may have

91
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:26,200
a real relapse because of your remedies and not because of the organism. In which case when the real relapse

92
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:32,550
comes then you have to come back
on the original remedy and repeat it.

93
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:43,580
-My experience with this is that when I gave a placebo in such case, the patient came and said, I'm doing much better.

94
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:53,840
-Sure, many times. They just need the reassurance.

95
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:05,450
-Patient who was suffering from ulcerative colitis and with one dose of Natrum muriaticum C200 she was free of bleeding

96
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:14,260
 for half a year. Now the situation is that she would like to apply for pension in earlier time

97
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:23,950
 due to her disease and she now, shortly before
I left for Alonissos, again she had bleeding from the rectum

98
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:32,500
and just like when she came for the first time, she had that facial expression which gives you the feeling

99
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:39,030
she already has been touched by death, I gave her a dose of Natrum muriaticum C200 again

100
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:50,420
and it had no effect anymore. What is now the situation? Should I leave her, let her go her way that has to be gone

101
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:58,310
or should I still go and look for another remedy? My feeling is that she wants to go and has to go.

102
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:13,950
-To die you mean? No, no. How old is she?

103
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:18,200
-She is 58.

104
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:34,540
-58? No. If with a remedy was better for 6 months and now she has a relapse in which the same remedy

105
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:45,920
does not have an effect it means that the organism has changed into certain aspects and needs another remedy.

106
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:56,940
So you have to try to find the next remedy, most probably Sepia or whatever remedy, it doesn't matter.

107
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:07,140
-I have a patient who is still in treatment with me now. She came for the first time when she was 19 years old

108
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:13,220
and complained of an extremely fast heartbeat which kept her from doing things. For example she could not

109
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:27,020
take care of her household anymore due to this fast heartbeat. I found out that at 19 she had an attack, she had been touched

110
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:38,080
  by a man whom she felt repulsive and many years after that she repeatedly had such attacks.

111
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:47,650
  While she was still in my office I gave her Natrum muriaticum in C30, just put it on the tongue

112
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:55,900
and the fast heartbeat was gone immediately. She took this remedy for a long period of time, later on C200

113
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:04,070
and the intervals grew larger and in the end she only had to take a C200 about every four weeks.

114
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:12,600
Then she entered the next layer which was Silica. She is now 89 years old and doing very well.

115
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:36,040
- And all these years she had the problem?

116
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:51,060
It is also something else that I have to tell you again, I have mentioned it before.

117
00:20:52,320 --> 00:21:04,210
You get a case with headache or with palpitation and you give a remedy and acts correctly and reduces the headaches

118
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:18,290
and then there is a relapse. This actually might not be a relapse but might be the same headaches

119
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:23,150
or similar headaches but on a much milder form.

120
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:33,020
Then you have to be careful that the modalities are the same as the original headache or now she needs

121
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:42,020
another remedy though she says, I am in a relapse, she may need another remedy because the headaches

122
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:50,120
are milder and the modality is different.
Then you have to search for another remedy.

123
00:21:52,630 --> 00:22:02,560
  It's very important when you re-examine a case to see whether the keynotes on which you

124
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:11,320
had prescribed originally, are gone and are not valid anymore for the present situation.

125
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:22,180
-In this case when you change the remedy and then you are afraid that this doesn't work, then what you do?

126
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:28,730
You repeat the old one or you give the placebo?

127
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:40,200
-If this is the case as we saw, you give placebo. You repeated the remedy, did not act, give placebo.

128
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:54,480
Here we don't have a full relapse, we have a partial relapse or maybe the person is feeling like this, it's not really a relapse.

129
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:06,300
-Then I want to ask if you give the remedy to the patient and she feels better, for instance, I have a patient who got

130
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:17,630
arthritis and I gave her a remedy and she felt better and she felt so better that she hold something very heavy

131
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:24,630
and then she got the problem again. Does this mean that the first remedy was not good enough

132
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:31,580
because it got her in stress and carrying something heavy she got the problem again?

133
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:39,090
-If that was the reaction, aggravation and then amelioration and then she gets this accident, most probably

134
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:47,450
during the time of the accident which she calls relapse, it is not needed the same remedy.

135
00:23:48,960 --> 00:24:01,740
She needed a new remedy for the accident. Because this is considered as an accident; it's not a relapse.

136
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:11,650
-We discussed with Geukens such cases and as you know Geukens repeats remedy more frequently

137
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:18,050
and he said it can be situations with a severe disease where you do not have the time to wait until

138
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:25,540
a full relapse appears but you must give
 the remedy in more frequent intervals.

139
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,880
What do you think about that ?

140
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:39,550
-No, I feel that if you have a case with an initial aggravation and then amelioration, then it is much better

141
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:49,410
 not to repeat the remedy. If you have a severe pathology in which you did not have this reaction initially

142
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:59,410
then you gave the remedy and the remedy made the person better. And then you repeated every day,

143
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:06,900
 it's getting better and better. That case belongs to the lower levels and needs a repetition

144
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:20,080
 of course and until it reaches a point where you will have this initial aggravation from the remedy.

145
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:31,300
But every time you see in a case this very beautiful reaction and the person says after a short period of time,

146
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:41,540
I have a relapse don't believe it unless she says 'I have been drinking coffee, I have been taking antibiotics,

147
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:52,500
I have been doing this and that', if he has antidoted the case this is a different story. But even if he had antidoted

148
00:25:52,600 --> 00:26:05,840
the case you have first to stop the antidotes, see that there is no relapse but if after stopping the antidotes,

149
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:12,790
still you see that the relapse continues
 then you repeat the remedy.

150
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:26,940
This situation can happen with coffee,
let us say somebody drinks coffee,

151
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:31,740
it cannot happen that within 2 weeks
 he has a relapse.

152
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:42,960
He got the right remedy, he is quite well now, he drinks coffee, it will take a few months before he has a relapse.

153
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:21,340
-Does this mean even not to give
 nothing is the same?

154
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:35,340
-Not to give nothing, yes, give placebo means to please, it comes from the verb 'placeo' and means to please,

155
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:47,840
so to please the person is ok and feels content. So the element of hysteria and reactions from

156
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:58,290
hysteria and fear subsides. So you don't
have the implications of hysterics

157
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:07,270
 or the fear I'm getting back, you give the
 placebo and then it goes down.

158
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:24,430
Homeopaths must understand more in depth human nature. That's why we are much more tolerating

159
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:39,660
situations than others. We are not severe. We cannot say, this is correct, you have to do this, because we know

160
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:51,430
that diseases make people act in a
 way which is not very social.

161
00:28:54,950 --> 00:29:07,330
Here you have a real relapse after a month.
 After a good aggravation, a good reaction,

162
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:14,940
it is back in a month. This is not normal.

163
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:25,480
Something abnormal is happening, it is not possible that the organism within a month after such

164
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:39,600
a good reaction by itself and without any
 reason will come back to relapse state.

165
00:29:40,840 --> 00:30:06,260
Search for antidotes like going to the dentist, taking chemicals drugs taking marijuana, LSD, ecstasy, crack,

166
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:34,000
all these antidote homeopathic treatment, coffee also. If it's so fast, three times the day you drink coffee?

167
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:48,550
Three coffees a day can bring within a month a relapse but the organism needs a shock.

168
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:54,210
What other shocks may have the organism?
 Then you ask whether it was a big stress,

169
00:30:54,310 --> 00:31:06,980
 somebody lost his fortune, lost a very
dear person, grief of whatever type.

170
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:17,160
This grief may bring back that situation.

171
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:38,220
But grief may not bring back a relapse
but may bring back a particular syndrome

172
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:45,550
 which we call Ignatia syndrome or Natrum muriaticum or Aurum syndrome.

173
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:56,690
So you may not see the relapse but you see the syndrome, in which case you will prefer to give the Ignatia

174
00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:00,060
instead of repeating the remedy.

175
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:11,520
-I wanted to ask what is the difference between the case I said before and this. This is taking something very heavy

176
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:18,060
 is stress as well or do you mean only mental stress and not physical stress?

177
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:29,180
-Physical stress as well but I said if the physical stress gives out symptoms different than the relapse

178
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:34,300
 then you prefer to give the
remedy that covers these symptoms.

179
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:43,410
That means if you lift something and you have given Calcarea carbonica and then now you have symptoms of Rhus tox,

180
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:51,430
you prefer to give Rhus tox. If you have another grief in which you have symptoms of Ignatia,

181
00:32:51,530 --> 00:33:03,270
you prefer to give Ignatia or Aurum during the stress. Don't consider it a relapse of the original state.

182
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:16,910
-My question regards some chronic cases, severe chronic cases like I had a case of a man 50 years old,

183
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:20,850
 he had a severe arthritis. Big swollen joints.

184
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:42,190
It's in a state of suppurating, it's coming out of his skin, it looks like cream, it's not pus, it's quite strange thing

185
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:53,320
 and he was for 5 years on medication.
 I gave him Ledum 1000 and he was much much better

186
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:59,270
but the problem was that all his symptoms start to come from his ankles to his knees up

187
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:10,090
 and then after this remedy he feels a great relief but symptoms come back and he cannot stand.

188
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:14,270
Because his ankles became
 more swollen than the knees.

189
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:23,840
He started to use these allopathic drugs in which he was on for the last 5 years. Of course he became much worse.

190
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:33,340
I tried to follow what we had here and I started
 to give every week the same remedy a C30

191
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:39,850
because he insisted that he must
use these allopathic drugs.

192
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:46,610
What would you do in this occasion, when there is a chronic case and the patient cannot give up

193
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:51,960
taking allopathic drugs but there is a
certain good progress with the remedy?

194
00:34:52,690 --> 00:35:01,340
-You repeat the remedy every day. You repeat the remedy every day, perhaps 2 or 3 times the day,

195
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:08,960
30 or 200 you repeat it every day to
counteract the action of the allopathic drugs.

196
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:30,620
-I have a question about drugs. I know a woman who has taken LSD 20 years ago and it triggered claustrophobia

197
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:41,940
since then and she's going to Homeopath but has no results. Do you think this is irreversible?

198
00:35:43,440 --> 00:36:02,680
-Claustrophobia by itself only it is not irreversible. It can be relieved by the correct remedy.

199
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:11,090
-I have a question again to antidoting. I had to antidote the effect of my remedy last week because otherwise

200
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:17,300
I would be in an narcotic state throughout the seminar and I took this Ignatia and then this sort

201
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:24,270
of narcotic effect was following. And I had to antidote it otherwise I wouldn't be able to come here.

202
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,610
-One week, two weeks then she rejuvenated.

203
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:44,500
-She antidoted with camphor and one hour after antidoting with camphor she had a very beautiful effect.

204
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:54,330
She felt very high and now she is like intermediate between very good and bad. What shall I do now?

205
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:04,180
-Very good question. I don't know.

206
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:18,080
You see now what happened is she
tried to stop the reaction of the remedy.

207
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:28,810
If she let herself sleep another 10-15 hours, these states do not last very long, she would have the full

208
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:37,300
benefit of the remedy. Now she cut it and I don't know. That's why the organism goes back and forward now

209
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:50,570
and she has to wait now, to go back to the original state in order to repeat. Otherwise if she repeats now Ignatia,

210
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:59,100
forget it, she will have no effect. She will
feel a little bit agitated and that's all.

211
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:09,340
Now she has to wait and see either there is an
 Ignatia again situation or maybe another remedy.

212
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,420
But now she has to wait, don't touch it
now because the reaction is very good.

213
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:23,180
 Initial aggravation like this. If the aggravation takes the form of sleepiness is one of the best.

214
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:29,460
 The organism takes all its energy
to relax and rejuvenate.

215
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:41,460
And he comes out of that sleep in a very very good condition. When you see that you say 'sleep'.

216
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:52,140
I had a case of Aurum, he slept for 20 days,
 day and night. He would just wake up, eat

217
00:38:52,240 --> 00:39:02,620
  and go back to sleep. He says, I had to give up my work, I cannot work. Very good.

218
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:13,620
Stop working. He was pushing himself working and working and then the organism broke down

219
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:25,540
and then you give and he slept and slept.
He was a man of almost 60 years old.

220
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:42,910
-One short remark to the case. I think this is a good working remedy and now he resists on taking allopathic drugs.

221
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:58,010
                      I spoiled my remedy in this case instead of insisting the patient to slow down his allopathic drugs.

222
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:10,000
-As long as there is amelioration then
you have to take out the drugs slowly.

223
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:19,840
But I am not sure your remedy is correct. From what you said, I have some doubts but anyhow try it.
