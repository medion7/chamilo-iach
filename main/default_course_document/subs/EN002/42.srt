1
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:29,710
-Hahnemann states that when a medication is given, the latent miasm breaks out.

2
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:43,190
 Is the disease pushed in or is
 it then revealing itself?

3
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:49,760
Hahnemann states that when we give repeated
doses they we must be further potentised.

4
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,970
 Why do we give repeated doses
of the same potency?

5
00:00:54,080 --> 00:01:01,090
And another question is: can you please tell us your point of view about vaccination?

6
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:11,610
- I can discuss a little bit about this
suppression which is legitimate question

7
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:18,200
for someone who is a new
comer for Homeopathy and

8
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:32,280
taking as an example several cases which we have seen already in this group.

9
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:42,390
We have noted several times that old
things that they were there that means the

10
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:50,900
 disturbance that was there, 10, 15, 20
years ago, is slowly coming

11
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:58,030
to the fore again, bringing their symptoms out.

12
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:08,250
That means for our understanding that
this type of disturbance was there before

13
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:19,730
and then it went deeper into the organism and
then created another disease situation,

14
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,610
 syndrome, disease or situation,
whatever you may call it,

15
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:31,400
but in effect it's not
different than the beginning.

16
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:41,960
So when we have a case, where somebody mentions skin eruption

17
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:52,090
like the case we have been seeing, a severe
skin eruption, if it was not treated and cured

18
00:02:52,900 --> 00:03:02,710
and if it is suppressed by creams, cortisone etc. this disturbance will go inside into the organism,

19
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:13,440
 into an organ, into a system or it can be distributing itself into the 3 levels, not physical.

20
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:23,840
If the organism is strong, a physical
disorder will stay on the physical level.

21
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:28,210
But if it's not strong enough then some of
these disorders will go in the emotions

22
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:32,560
and the emotions are closing up
and they are becoming negative.

23
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:39,980
 And if it is not strong enough it goes to the mental. So it is a distribution on these levels.

24
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:47,360
As we treat, then this is becoming
better and this is becoming better,

25
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:51,120
the whole thing goes back to the physical.

26
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:57,180
Then we say that the original
problem was suppressed originally

27
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,520
and diffused within the
organism into 3 levels.

28
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:13,350
If the organism is strong, it will keep the mental away, it will keep the emotional away.

29
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,850
But as the organism is breaking
down, it is first the emotional.

30
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:25,290
What is the first appearance
of disturbance in this level?

31
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,140
I have some diagrams in the
book where I show that here

32
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:39,400
we have a hierarchy of different organs.
The organs on the mental level.

33
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:54,090
The organ of irritability, of anger.

34
00:04:54,670 --> 00:05:08,410
 In this level there are organs as well, concerned with irritability, concerned with anxiety,

35
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:16,280
concerned with depression, concerned with suicidal depression, concerned with apathy.

36
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:22,210
So the first disturbance we will see if the disturbance goes to the emotions,

37
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:28,330
it will go to the lowest level of
emotion which is irritability.

38
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:36,420
And the lowest level of mental
which is affection of the memory.

39
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:52,190
If this organism is tired and it has the cortisone cream, and it is tired because of several

40
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:59,310
stresses that happen in life, my family problems,
my work is not doing well etc. he will find out

41
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,560
 that his memory is breaking down.
He starts forgetting.

42
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:08,800
 And if the problems become more and
more the organism can not handle it,

43
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:17,380
then you will see confusion starting. Then I cannot concentrate, then I can not think, then

44
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:29,520
I have confusion between reality and non-reality.

45
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:38,630
And then eventually the non-reality breaks
down the mental and you go to schizophrenia

46
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:42,400
and severe mental disorders.

47
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:58,400
So we have in each case, every case of us
has a history and a progress of disease.

48
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:06,530
There is a basic disorder of some magnitude.

49
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:15,850
That basic disorder will appear in the physical body as long as the physical body is strong.

50
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:24,760
 If it is not strong, then it will go into the
emotions, then more deep in the emotions,

51
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,740
more deep in the mental.

52
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:36,210
And as you treat wrongly homeopathically or allopathically and primarily allopathically,

53
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:44,890
because all these people are treated allopathically, the millions and the billions

54
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:48,790
are treated in an allopathic manner.

55
00:07:48,990 --> 00:08:02,000
So you get a case of cystitis in a little
child and you give antibiotics,

56
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:14,760
then you find out that after 2-3 months
 there is a relapse. Cystitis again in the child.

57
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:21,450
You give again antibiotics; then you find that
after 2.5 months (not 3) there is a repetition,

58
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:25,800
you give again, after 2 months there is a repetition, then after 1,5 month.

59
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:35,060
 The children who come to us they say,
almost every month she is having a cystitis.

60
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:41,490
That means the treatment given for the
cystitis originally was wrong,

61
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:50,720
breaking down the immune system so it cannot function anymore, it cannot defend itself.

62
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:59,750
That breaking down of the immune system is
not necessary to bring out cystitis again.

63
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:12,040
If the organism is weak instead of
cystitis it may bring psoriasis out.

64
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:21,420
If the organism is even less strong
then the child becomes irritable

65
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:29,440
and then we'll have a Vertatrum album
case, mentally disturbed.

66
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:35,440
So the cystitis or the tendency
of the organism to get cystitis here

67
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:44,210
and treated wrongly and what we call suppressively then it changes into restlessness.

68
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:53,340
Cystitis into restlessness. So the child
comes to us because it is hyperactive child

69
00:09:53,440 --> 00:10:02,920
and we treat hyperactive child and in the course of treatment we get back the original cystitis

70
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:08,360
then we have to treat correctly the cystitis.

71
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,540
In these cases that we have been treating,

72
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:22,760
you remember the case with
the severe skin eruption?

73
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:33,400
Then you remember the other case that she was having rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed?

74
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:47,360
Then the terrible headaches, day and night.
Headaches all the time.

75
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:58,230
The original disturbance is the same; manifesting itself one time as rheumatoid arthritis,

76
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,640
the other time as severe lumbago with
sciaticaand then as headaches.

77
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:16,050
And you will see headaches which are treated correctly, then they go away from here

78
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:24,150
and then the lumbago starts. I think that was
the case also that you have seen live in here.

79
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:32,710
They go like this for months, for years, having lumbagos and you treat correctly the lumbagos

80
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:41,350
and then it starts going out from where it started. What it was there? Leucorrhea, originally,

81
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:50,580
 that it was closed. It can cause a lot of problems, hormonal problems, mental problems,

82
00:11:50,680 --> 00:12:02,640
emotional problems. And leucorrhea
which is treated with antifungal drugs

83
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:22,630
 or leucorrhea which is suppressed, then this suppression of leucorrhea it will cause that.

84
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:35,380
 The suppression of tremendous perspiration; that means there is a disturbance, the organism

85
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:42,700
cannot process the toxins and it has to
take them through perspiration.

86
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,480
You don't like this, you put anti-perspirants, you stop the perspiration. You are going to have

87
00:12:47,590 --> 00:13:05,530
 problems; that means that offensive
perspiration with a lot of toxins.

88
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:15,410
That means that the kidneys are not able
to clean the blood as they should.

89
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,650
That means you have a weakness
already in the kidneys.

90
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:26,560
You stop the perspiration, the kidneys break down and you see stones  after 10 years.

91
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:38,130
And you have the kidneys colics.
Eventually through treating the kidneys colics,

92
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:42,460
you have to arrive at a stage where the
organism is strong enough now

93
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,090
 through perspiration to get rid of the toxins.

94
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:59,540
Then if you are lucky as a patient and as
a doctor also, you find further the remedy

95
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:04,020
 and then you even treat the
original problem that was there.

96
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:10,040
This is what we call suppression and
we see it again and again and again.

97
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:16,500
What I wanted to say, apart from that,
is that in her case yesterday,

98
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,430
we decided we don't know the
remedy because it was not clear.

99
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:24,240
Nobody could say that this
 is a clear case of Puls.

100
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:30,200
because she had some opposing symptoms.

101
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:38,330
She had 2 keynotes of Sulph, 2 keynotes
 of Puls, 2 keynotes of Phos

102
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:42,600
and you say now, 'where am I going?'

103
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:55,840
What happened is that she took two drugs
like Nat-m untimely and also Nux -v.

104
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:02,010
These two remedies they have disturbed
the development of the case.

105
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:22,000
Every case has a development and this
can be disturbed by even a wrong potency.

106
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,120
It is not that our remedies will create side effects.

107
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:32,720
They will not create side effects; that's why
 we say these are innocent remedies.

108
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:38,510
They are not so innocent as they appear.
The moment they change the pattern

109
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:44,550
and they disturb the development then you
 are not able to continue with the case

110
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:47,830
Like in her case and you say, 'I don't know'.

111
00:15:52,910 --> 00:16:06,090
So don't be in a hurry, take this, take that.
Even if you have and accident, take Arnica.

112
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:10,340
 No, I don't believe in that.

113
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:16,590
You have to have a reason for taking the remedy. If you have a reason and the remedy is correct

114
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:26,680
then it helps the correct development
of the case, even if it is an acute remedy.

115
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:31,740
 An acute remedy is not
apart from the whole case.

116
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:38,090
Because you have to imagine a basic disturbance in the organism;

117
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:42,360
then it changes expressions.

118
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:49,910
Then one time, the expressions of this basic disturbance it might be continuous,

119
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:56,120
acute conditions, pharyngitis, pharyngitis.

120
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:06,280
She gets to a point where she
 gets bronchitis, bronchitis.

121
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:13,740
Mental cases that are treated,
they are going to state of bronchitis.

122
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:23,450
Vertigo, severe vertigo, then you treat
these vertigos and she wakes up

123
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:31,150
on mental level and then you see bronchitis.
Now treat wrongly the bronchitis, the vertigo

124
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:40,200
will be back. Treat correctly the bronchitis
and the person gets better and better.

125
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:47,300
That is what we are learning here and that
 is why we try to be as careful as possible.

126
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:58,480
 I know it's very difficult, I know it. Don't be disappointed because it's very difficult.

127
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:16,180
 I admit that but it is very rewarding in the end.

128
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:24,780
There are laws which are revealing
themselves; otherwise we are in the dark.

129
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:34,670
You see in 1974, in the International
Congress in the Liga, in Washington D.C.,

130
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:43,510
out of my pushing behind the scenes, (because
 I was always working behind the scenes),

131
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:54,990
I tried to persuade the Liga to put some standards in education, back in 1974.

132
00:18:55,090 --> 00:19:03,220
The English who were dominating
the scene by that time,

133
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:12,910
there was a certain doctor, after he heard standards are going to be imposed,

134
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:21,040
he was very sharp tongued,
he got up and gave a speech.

135
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:30,320
And finally concluded that each country
should have its own laws for Homeopathy.

136
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:44,530
I said, that's very interesting, ok maybe, I said,
 in England the law of gravity does not work.

137
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:55,960
So doctor T. can jump in England from the fifth floor without anything happening to him.

138
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:05,800
In England the laws do not work, what is this?

139
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:15,520
And then it was said in a
meeting of 300 medical doctors

140
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:23,340
and nobody got up and say, why don't
you jump from the fifth floor in England.

141
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:35,470
Don't do it here because in America the laws
are working; so we don't need to have a funeral.

142
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:45,900
When you do something and you
enter an area where you're understanding

143
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:50,450
 the laws and you apply the
laws the sense is totally different.

144
00:20:50,550 --> 00:21:04,460
The confusion starts disappearing. It does not mean that all the confusion will go out.

145
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:13,700
I want to answer also in the other problem with vaccination.

146
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,250
I have written my ideas in the
Science of Homeopathy.

147
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:29,170
By that time, I'm talking about in 1970
when I was writing the book,

148
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:39,060
I had understood certain things theoretically,
I had understood them on a practical manner

149
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:41,750
 because I could see what was
happening, I was observing.

150
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:50,970
Theoretically I made a model which I have written down and it says that in vaccination

151
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,830
you have several groups of people.

152
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:02,230
The first group is the one group which is very sensitive to that particular epidemic.

153
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:11,620
This group during the epidemic will get the disease because it's very sensitive.

154
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,720
It has a predisposition for this disease.
This group will get it.

155
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:27,000
 Now this group gets the vaccination because
 it's very sensitive to that particular vaccination,

156
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:34,210
 then the reaction is very
strong and what it does?

157
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:42,100
A percentage of this group is dying or has permanent side effects from the vaccination.

158
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:53,800
This group is in danger. Not everybody
dies from that group with the vaccination.

159
00:22:53,820 --> 00:23:02,520
The rest of the group will have
permanent side effects.

160
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:14,100
That means the organism is so violated
that in order to counteract the vaccination,

161
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:22,740
produces antibodies which in consequence
 have severe side effects like encephalitis,

162
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:27,400
encephalomyelitis, nephritis etc.

163
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:38,660
So apart from the deaths, we have
severe problems with side effects
or the long term effects.

164
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:46,420
The long term effects mean you get chronic headaches, you see a smallpox vaccination

165
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:54,320
created a lot of problems that usually were counteracted by Thuja and that's how

166
00:23:54,460 --> 00:24:02,770
 it came to our book the idea of vaccination
and Thuja. It's a smallpox vaccination that was

167
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:17,390
many times counteracted by Thuja; that means these people they had effects that stayed for life.

168
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:20,920
That means they became sick for life.

169
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:31,610
Therefore they were protected.
Because now after the vaccination

170
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:38,900
they were too sick to get it.
That is why they were protected.

171
00:24:39,060 --> 00:25:00,840
The second group in which you will see
a superficial reaction but strong, fever,

172
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:09,820
the organism reacts against it, raises the fever

173
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:15,360
and then these people counteract
the effect of the vaccination.

174
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:23,040
These people are not anymore vaccinated.
They don't have antibodies,

175
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:34,240
because they are the group who have
 less predisposition for that disease.

176
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:38,170
It's a disease which is not very
sensitive for the organism,

177
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:43,540
therefore the organism pushes out
and takes out the effect of the vaccination.

178
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:54,020
So this group will develop an immediate reaction and will be spared of the chronic effects.

179
00:25:55,430 --> 00:26:00,870
And there is a third group
that has no reaction at all.

180
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:07,950
They are vaccinated and not reaction.
That means two things.

181
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:17,890
One is that the organism is too sick
already to have a reaction,

182
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:23,820
therefore because it's too sick,will never
get the disease during the epidemic.

183
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:29,840
 this group will never get the epidemic. This group stays without any effect,

184
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:35,650
the epidemic comes and goes and this percentage of population remains

185
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:53,540
 untouched either because they are very sick
 or because their organism is strong enough

186
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:00,380
and has no predisposition at all towards this disease. It's like nothing, they don't pay attention.

187
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:04,780
The vaccination doesn't concern them.

188
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:16,750
From this group maybe some people will get it, (esp.those who had the strongest reaction)

189
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,660
during the epidemic, might had gotten
the epidemic in a mild degree;

190
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,840
these people will get the
epidemic in severe degree.

191
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:29,120
Some of them they will die during the epidemic.

192
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:33,280
These are the facts according to my understanding and I have recorded them,

193
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:37,910
I have written them down, back 20 years ago.

194
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:44,720
And I was talking about these ideas 20 years
ago when nobody was talking about this.

195
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:56,670
Then the question is what shall
we do as a medical society?

196
00:27:56,770 --> 00:28:01,230
What are the decisions to be taken,
who is going to be vaccinated?

197
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:08,400
What I said, always publically
when I speak about it,

198
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:13,160
it is that first we realize that this is the problem.

199
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:19,960
That by vaccinating this group you are
risking the life of certain of the people

200
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:27,940
and you are risking also the
life becoming miserable.

201
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:33,380
You make side effects that will last a whole life.

202
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:39,520
From this group also several people
will also have long side effects.

203
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:46,160
From this group we are concerned,
 they are very sick.

204
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:53,200
Have you ever seen a schizophrenic
to take an epidemic? Never!

205
00:28:53,290 --> 00:29:01,200
Have you seen any person on last stage
of diseases to get an epidemic? Never.

206
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:07,580
An epidemic the children usually get or grown ups who have a strong organism

207
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:14,040
and who have a predisposition.

208
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:28,740
It's very interesting, I will give you an example
 to show you how the organism is working.

209
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:37,080
Here we discuss everything.

210
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:45,810
My nephew, my sister's son got diphtheria
 at the age of six.

211
00:29:45,910 --> 00:30:00,180
He was in the hospital, I was outside of the country, I did not participate at all.

212
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:15,800
About a month ago, my sister developed a very severe pharyngitis with severe pain.

213
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:23,080
She was in Athens and one of the doctors
said, look at the...

214
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:34,040
and she was depleted of energy totally
and she started having some kind of dyspnoea.

215
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:45,840
I said to one of the doctors look and tell me.
 He looks and says, she has white membranes.

216
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:56,360
Then I remembered the incident with diphtheria;
 I said to my sister, take Diphtherinum 200.

217
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:06,140
The next day the doctor said, I couldn't believe it.

218
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,120
She was totally exhausted, the next day the membranes are gone, almost

219
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:18,320
the pain 80% better and the strength is back. What happened?

220
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:33,970
.......She did not fall sick because there was
not a total predisposition.

221
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:43,760
If she was predisposed to diphtheria, she would
get it at the time of the child because she was

222
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:54,320
 nursing him etc. I remember they did not
allow her to go into the hospital and she

223
00:31:54,550 --> 00:32:07,270
was so anxious, she climbed a tree to be
able to see through the window
whether the son was alive.

224
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:20,000
She belonged to this second group;
 that means a little bit of predisposition

225
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:31,830
but not enough to break out the epidemic in this
organism but somewhere the antibodies were

226
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:39,460
 left in the organism and when the organism
went down andwas exhausted,

227
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:45,050
then she came up with the idea of diphtheria.

228
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:51,090
You see, there are such observations
 which have brought me to these ideas,

229
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:59,030
and I made that model and
nobody of course pays attention

230
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:05,340
to that apart from the last few years where people are finally becoming aware that maybe

231
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:12,340
vaccinations is not such a great idea as we
 may have thought. When I was bringing

232
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:21,890
 these ideas back in 1970, 72 etc.
and I was teaching the doctors in Athens

233
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:29,510
they were looking with great skepticism and the pediatricians always would come up and say:

234
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:37,320
'what do you suggest?' I said 'I don't know'. Because if you suggest,

235
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:46,590
don't vaccinate this group, this group will
get the epidemic, if the epidemic comes.

236
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:52,440
That is another story because several of the epidemics they don't come anymore today.

237
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:58,990
They have a trend, they come and go.
We have to recognize the trend.

238
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:06,270
 Is the trend for smallpox? Wait it's gone,
don't vaccinate for smallpox, of course.

239
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:15,120
They think they have vaccinated for smallpox
and they have eliminated it. That is totally wrong.

240
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:19,810
Small pox has been eliminated
not because of the vaccination

241
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:27,860
but because the population is too
sick to get it today.

242
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:33,590
Only strong population can get
an epidemic and then the epidemic

243
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:40,140
has to have conditions like uncleanliness.

244
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:46,930
So such epidemics will break out in India, in Pakistan, and in these countries.

245
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:58,150
Not here because the population in the West
 is too sick to be infected by smallpox.

246
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:10,640
Raise the health of western population and
 let them be in not a clean condition

247
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:15,110
and you will see it coming back.

248
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:23,280
So more or less this is the model for
me but here what I say,

249
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:28,760
let's come and discuss, can we find out
through the means we have today

250
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:33,800
who might be over sensitive to this epidemic?

251
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:38,170
Maybe there are some parameters,
we can do a research to find out

252
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:50,200
who are these people who are proned to get
 the epidemic and then see what we can do.

253
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:56,600
How we protect them and why we
vaccinate these people?

254
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:08,400
Or maybe another idea will come up if
it is understood by medical researchers.

255
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:16,680
Hygenic measures, better
food, better conditions

256
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:23,270
raising the health of these people to the
extend you bring them to the second group.

257
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:32,360
-George, what do you think happened few years ago when the plague came back to India?

258
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:38,000
What made them healthy enough to
get that disease back?

259
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:43,770
-Indians according to my understanding,
because I lived in India, as you know,

260
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:53,650
 the Indians at this moment they are still
suffering a lot on the physical level.

261
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:58,470
 They are not sick in mental-emotional.

262
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:09,520
The Indian race is healthier than the
European or the American. They are healthier.

263
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:20,310
The Chinese also are healthier, the Malaysians are healthier and therefore they get

264
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:32,980
these epidemics in these countries. The African people are healthier; that's why they will get these epidemics.

265
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:38,920
You will say ok but during these epidemics, in cholera you have so many people dying etc.

266
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:48,110
But you cannot decide to make the whole population sick in order to prevent an epidemic

267
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:54,100
 from breaking out. This is not the right way
of thinking, this is my concern,

268
00:37:54,740 --> 00:38:02,000
and this is what I'm saying. Is it true that this
is a true model? Do you accept it?

269
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:11,170
I have written once to the W.H.O.
and discuss these matters,

270
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:19,820
of course I did not receive any answer.
 I say, we discuss.

271
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:26,230
Bring your experience and we from the homeopathic point of view,

272
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:32,260
we bring our experience and then we conclude.

273
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:45,100
What are you doing? The whole population have been vaccinating, bringing it down, down, down.

274
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:52,240
And you see old people at the age of 25.
I tell you, people at the age of 25

275
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:57,120
they will not be able to have sex, they will not
be able to function properly, their mind will be

276
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:08,840
 twisted and all kinds of crazy ideas will
jump up and flow all over the places.

277
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:17,840
-If we have a very good immune system we could not get any effect not only in epidemic

278
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:28,180
but even in tetanus and rabbies.
This occupies my mind always.

279
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:47,450
-The rabies is a very virulent organism which is like putting hydrocyanic acid into the blood.

280
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:54,740
If you put hydrocyanic acid into the blood, you cannot say I give you a remedy and save you.

281
00:39:54,840 --> 00:40:02,490
Forget it. The process of decomposition is so
 fast that you don't have chance, you will die.

282
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:10,770
Or you take strong poison whatever it might be.
A strong poison is a different thing.

283
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:27,000
and rabies or tetanus once you get it ok.
But Vangelis was there by the time,

284
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:36,750
a rusty nail went into my foot,
so deep. Here on the island

285
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:47,990
there are a lot of goats... and some
Greek doctors were here.

286
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:56,270
Vangelis was one of them and they saw
this... 'you vaccinate, you vaccinate'.

287
00:40:56,370 --> 00:41:05,280
I said I don't know, if I get it I will see what
I will do and I did not vaccinate and of course

288
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:17,880
 nothing happened because I'm still here.
 But suddenly everyone was waiting 48 hours.

289
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:28,250
Ok, 42,43, 45, 46 they created a
situation around me, it was terrible.

290
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:45,640
If it's my karma, my fate to die from tetanus
 I will die from tetanus nothing can save me.

291
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:54,680
How many people are vaccinated and
what is the effect of tetanus?

292
00:41:56,390 --> 00:42:09,890
Somebody was telling me in this seminar,
he was vaccinated for tetanus. Relapse.

293
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,070
-What about rabies?

294
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:18,000
-Rabies? If you are bitten by a dog
who is proven to have rabies,

295
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:22,480
you have to have the treatment,
it's not a vaccination.

296
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:28,110
Once you have the rabies, there is a
 treatment, I believe there is today, I don't know.

297
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:36,390
By that time there was a treatment in the
peritoneal cavity where they put a lot of

298
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:41,830
 injections and shake the organism
very very strongly.

299
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:48,530
So once you get rabies, you have to be
treated of course, I don't say don't be treated.

300
00:42:48,630 --> 00:43:06,570
But there is no vaccination for rabies.
You see when I was in India I heard of two

301
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:14,100
 cases from an older teacher whom
 I had there, that he had two rabies cases.

302
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:20,850
That he claimed to have treated
with Homeopathy, I don't know.

303
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:28,080
I did not see any, either tetanus or rabies.

304
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:40,130
But from the description of tetanus it's a terrible thing to see. Who have seen a tetanus case?

305
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:51,460
Three. How many were saved?

306
00:43:51,560 --> 00:44:03,680
Two died. Who has seen somebody
saved from tetanus?

307
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:21,600
How many deaths? 2, 10, 5, 1, 1.

308
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:38,040
From this little statistics we show that
the rate of death in tetanus is more than 60%.

309
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:47,270
 I don't remember what the books say.

310
00:44:49,320 --> 00:45:11,270
The disease Farber granulomatosis is called. Has anybody heard of that disease?

311
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:17,880
Deficiency of ceramidase.

312
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:35,140
 It is in children, they die within a few years, affecting the joints, the vocal chords

313
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:44,040
and some spleen or liver eventually affection.

314
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:51,180
It was the case I was talking about as being diagnosed as rheumatoid arthritis.

315
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:04,980
-During my work in Peru I saw a lot of cases of poliomyelitis, people that have been crippled for the rest of their lives.

316
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:09,980
-Can you repeat?

317
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:20,080
-During my work in Peru, in South America,
 I've seen a lot of cases of poliomyelitis,

318
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:34,380
who couldn't walk anymore and I think it's high risk to say just let the people get this illness.

319
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:23,020
-Now coming back to this idea.
She says in Peru she saw a lot of cases

320
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:28,660
of side effects of poliomyelitis.
In Peru, not in here.

321
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:40,730
 Here you will hear one or two cases.
Even that they were vaccinated,

322
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:44,880
belonging to this or to this group

323
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:54,510
but in our societies you will not
see these epidemics anymore.

324
00:47:55,840 --> 00:48:01,610
You will not see because we are
not as healthy as the Peruvians.

325
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,780
The Peruvians are very healthy people
I can tell you.

326
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:17,660
In our society we are mentally-emotionally disturbed and we cannot get these diseases.

327
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:23,480
That's why the children get them
 because they are strong.

328
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:34,240
You saw some cases in Peru or in India and then what happens with us? It's a different matter.

329
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:41,530
We better bring up our organism to
the state where we can get it again.

330
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:51,830
and you will see also the same diseases will
 be returning to us but in a modified way

331
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:59,180
and then we will have a problem
 treating such diseases.

332
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:15,340
You will see Tuberculosis coming
back with a different species of bacillus.

333
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:21,140
And then it will be much worse
and much more virulent.

334
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:35,760
And you will see a breaking up of tuberculosis that kills thousands of people by the year 2005.

335
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:38,510
These are questions that we have to be aware.

336
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:48,200
-Is it a sign of health or a sign of sickness
that so many people in Africa die from AIDS?

337
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:56,660
-Ok, my theory for AIDS, you know
 if you read the book, is that AIDS

338
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:05,200
is the result of breaking down of the immune system because of repeated antibiotics

339
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:17,570
 in cases of syphillis and gonorrhea. In Africa there is a fantastic sexual liberation.

340
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:26,920
The structures of tribes living under
certain laws are breaking down,

341
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:33,850
they go to the cities, they get
extreme syphillis and gonorrhea.

342
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:38,370
How do we know? If you go to
the statistics of W.H.O.

343
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:46,290
you'll see that deaths from syphillis and gonorrhea  are tremendous.

344
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:49,960
They are dying from syphilis and gonorrhea
 in Africa more than anybody else,

345
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:52,390
that means they get a lot of
syphilis and gonorrhea.

346
00:50:52,640 --> 00:51:00,790
They get the worst of antibiotics coming from the West, that have the worse side effects,

347
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:04,990
that means breaking down the immune
system, instead of throwing them into the sea,

348
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:08,710
 they go over the sea, to Africa.

349
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:13,190
And then people go over the counter,
 they don't have doctors,

350
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:20,280
'give me this medicine' and take, take, take
and they broke down the immune system.

351
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:32,880
 AIDS is nothing but a disguise
of venereal disease.

352
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:42,020
Whether it is syphilis or gonorrhea it
doesn't matter, it's not important.

353
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:47,320
It is the organism who can get syphillis and gonorrhea and treated repeatedly by antibiotics,

354
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:53,340
their immune system breaks down
and they will develop AIDS.

355
00:51:53,440 --> 00:52:02,810
That is why in my understanding, AIDS is so exposed because they broke down the

356
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:08,720
immune system by taking a lot of
antibiotics and a lot of venereal diseases.

357
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:18,720
Go to the Arab countries and you see no AIDS because the moral structures  are still very strong.

358
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:30,240
You go with the wrong man or the wrong woman and finished, no AIDS, nothing. Cut and finish.

359
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:47,220
In BBC I saw a man who went with a
princess, they cut his throat because

360
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:59,270
he had an affair with the princess. I was in London and I remember the Saudi's

361
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:01,010
 were trying to influence the BBC and
say not to show this, not to show this.

362
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:05,020
They offered money not to show this.

363
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:12,800
The BBC said forget it, we will show it.
I have seen it with my own eyes.

364
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:19,400
They had a hidden camera and they took this and they had the video and they showed it.

365
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:29,140
But in Arab countries, no AIDS.
Because sexual liberation is not yet there.

366
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:41,160
 Go to the Haiti, near New York where
Americans go there, you understand what

367
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:48,430
happens there, it's the highest level,
why? Because men are bi-sexual.

368
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:54,560
They go with homosexuals,
then they go with prostitutes

369
00:53:55,470 --> 00:54:01,290
then the prostitutes go with normal
 men and they have this explosion.

370
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:10,080
Because the homosexuals from NY
they go to Haiti to have a nice time.

371
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:23,930
In '83 when I saw the statistics, now it is covered up, in '83 it was very clear for every researcher

372
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:29,350
that the high risk group was the group
 of male homosexuals, why?

373
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:42,700
 Because I could see in their history several times infections from syphillis and gonorrhea.

374
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:49,720
Now the whole issue has been covered and nobody knows what is going on anymore.

375
00:54:51,150 --> 00:55:01,010
Not for me; I still say this the truth, this is what has happened and I will insist that this is

376
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,760
what happens until they can prove to me something else.

377
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:30,520
That rings me a bell, Farbry's, Farbry's.
So you challenge my memory !

378
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:41,770
There was another issue with her again,
exactly the same, where I said,

379
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:51,050
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has severe cramping pain, there was Vangelis

380
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:58,040
who is a psychiatrist and neurologist
and Alexander. They said no, no, no.

381
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:08,530
Alexander did not say no. But he said
'no in ALS you do not get severe pains'.

382
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:17,510
 I said, ok Alexander go to the lexicon and Alexander comes, she reads no pain.

383
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:27,260
I said, 'no'. You are reading wrongly.
Because ALS is called Charcot

384
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:47,080
 and there is another disease
Charcot Marie-Tooth

385
00:56:52,430 --> 00:57:01,010
which is another type of disease totally
different than the Charcot, the ALS.

386
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:06,980
And then she was reading from there and I said, 'no you are reading wrongly, give me'

387
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:17,650
and then we read the ALS and of course in
the progress stages you have severe pain.

388
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:24,170
I knew it because I had several cases
which I treated for tremendous pains,

389
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:30,040
never mind what the books tell. I have seen it.

390
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:36,970
And then she made a mistake,
you made it for a second time.

391
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:25,080
-If I may say so concerning the Peruvians the answer is not satisfying for me because

392
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:36,440
 we cannot risk so much for these people. I also remember measles epidemia which killed

393
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:44,480
whole tribes which have been living in the Amazonian forest and they did not have

394
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:46,400
any contact with the civilization.

395
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:51,320
- Which disease?
- Measles.

396
00:58:51,420 --> 00:58:58,130
-With measles it killed the whole tribe?
 I don't believe that, no. A whole tribe?

397
00:58:58,230 --> 00:59:03,760
-I mean I have to imagine that genetically
they have all the same defect

398
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:11,310
 which I don't believe this is not according to
 the law of nature because of the selection.

399
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:10,570
-When the Spanish people came to Mexico,
 the Indians died of plain coryza,

400
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:13,900
thousands of them. Of plain coryza!
-They died.

401
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:19,880
-And they said it is because our population
 they get antibodies immediately

402
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:24,170
and they did not have any of these antibodies.

403
01:00:24,270 --> 01:00:30,070
-Most probably instead of coryza they could say, influenza. Most probably it was influenza.

404
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:35,300
-But for the whites it was a small
thing and they, died of it.

405
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:42,630
Maybe with the measles in those populations
which are healthy populations, is similar.

406
01:00:46,090 --> 01:00:53,840
-Anyhow what is a fact is that immunization
 is not a simple issue and it should be seriously

407
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:58,960
discussed by medical authorities and governments and take different decisions than

408
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:09,410
 the ones that they're applying and they are forcing the population to take this immunization.

409
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:19,970
I don't agree with this practice and I believe that we should sit down

410
01:01:20,070 --> 01:01:22,070
and discuss about these issues
and find out really what happens
