1
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:27,630
-Point 4. We try to discuss point 4.

2
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:44,420
-Group 4 yes. But it can be group 1
in case of wrong medication.

3
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,660
The same observation, group 5. The amelio-
ration comes first and then aggravation,

4
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:34,160
it can be either group 1 or whatever group with the wrong medication except of group 4

5
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:42,060
which is the right medicine gives a relief
 but then the symptoms come back

6
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:51,220
or symptoms are changed.
This can be group 4.

7
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,720
In group 4 where we have
usually incurable cases,

8
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,740
we see an amelioration with the correct
remedy. If the amelioration comes

9
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,760
first and the aggravation comes
afterwards, in other groups,

10
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:14,820
that means the remedy was
close and not exact.

11
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,230
-What about group 5?

12
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,200
-There is no group 5.

13
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:34,940
-Concerning point 5, when the aggravation comes is this the point

14
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,470
when the patient changes
from group 4 to group 3?

15
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,890
-You are talking about 5?

16
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,550
-Yes, first the amelioration comes and after maybe a second or third remedy,

17
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:12,020
then there comes an aggravation.
It shows a reaction on the remedy.

18
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,180
-The amelioration comes first and the aggravation comes afterwards,

19
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:23,260
 it is a usual observation if you
treat a severe pathology.

20
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:32,820
If after treating several times, the aggravation comes first, that means that patient

21
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:42,760
may have come up to group 3 and
maybe there is a possibility of cure.

22
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:54,520
- Is it real aggravation or is it only back
to normal after the amelioration.

23
00:03:54,620 --> 00:04:08,960
-What Kent means here is actually worse,
that means he had a kind of anxiety,

24
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,300
 he was better, now he has
some panic attacks also.

25
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:21,820
That means aggravation afterwards.
Wrong remedy, he says, or incurable cases.

26
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,260
-So that means you can push the
patient even into worse state?

27
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:38,840
-Yes exactly. Too short relief of symptoms.

28
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:46,740
You give a remedy and for
one week he feels better.

29
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:58,050
Again, the idea is that either the
 remedy is incorrect, is close

30
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:06,210
or the case is incurable,
 the case is on group 4.

31
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:10,630
Here is an observation which says:

32
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:19,460
a full time amelioration of the symptoms,
 yet no special relief of the patient.

33
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:30,720
What does that mean? Can anybody tell me?

34
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:47,460
-Maybe in this case we have taken off
one layer, so there is an amelioration

35
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:53,590
 but there is still one or more layers of it.

36
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:59,250
-I think it's only a suppression, it's not a cure.

37
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:08,870
-No, it's not a suppression. Here when you
talk about suppression you have always

38
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:16,660
to see that some deeper
 symptoms are worse.

39
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,600
Here the observation says:

40
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:26,250
a full time amelioration of the symptoms
 yet no special relief of the patient.

41
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:33,340
-The pathological symptoms are
better
 but emotional is worse.

42
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:42,730
-Emotionally or mentally or energy wise,
the general state is not affected.

43
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:52,650
What it means, I will tell you. This is
something also that happens many times

44
00:06:52,750 --> 00:07:19,480
 in our prescriptions because you are
 treating a level with Nat-m here.

45
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:26,290
You take away the upper layer
 on which pathology?

46
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:34,780
He comes to you and says I have a
lumbago, I have a cold, either an acute

47
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:42,900
or a chronic condition and you prescribe
a remedy, with the lumbago.

48
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:53,660
And the lumbago goes away but the
deeper layer, there is no change.

49
00:07:53,760 --> 00:08:05,330
That means the remedy was correct
but did not touch the underlying,

50
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:12,200
the deeper layers of the patient.

51
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:27,900
That means that you will have to study the case further to discover what is underlying in this case.

52
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:33,660
The first remedy is correct
but it is the first remedy.

53
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:41,250
You need a second remedy to bring
about deeper changes in the patient.

54
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:49,750
This is a case where for instance after
grief you have spasms of the muscles

55
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:55,790
of the back, the whole back becomes stiff.

56
00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:04,020
You give Ignatia and the muscles
 are released, nothing else.

57
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:14,110
The same thing with lumbago,
the same thing with whatever acute,

58
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:26,720
a cystitis, sinusitis. You prescribe the
remedy but does not touch the deeper layer.

59
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:35,560
These cases are not easy to treat.

60
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:45,510
In the cases where immediately
 with the first remedy you give,

61
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:51,780
you touch the deeper layers
of the person where he feels

62
00:09:51,880 --> 00:10:03,900
rejuvenated, this is a case
which we call an easy case.

63
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:16,640
The remedy which appears to be
 first is indicated on deeper level as well.

64
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:33,470
For instance here comes a person with gastritis and he has to take anti acids all the time.

65
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:57,320
You prescribe Robinia and the burning
goes away and comes after a while, back.

66
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:06,080
You prescribe Nux Vomica, he is better,
back. Both Robinia and Nux Vomica

67
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:17,990
are close remedies, observation number 5,

68
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:43,200
 Rob. and Nux-v. are going to touch
the case, without having any effect.

69
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,980
There is another possibility.

70
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:58,740
You give Nat-m and the
burning of the stomach goes away

71
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:09,850
and we have a full time amelioration,
no effect of the patient.

72
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:25,940
Third possibility, you give Ars
because the person is restless,

73
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:35,200
he had a full picture of Arsenicum. You give
Ars. and not only the gastritis goes away

74
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,180
but you have a rejuvenation of the organism.

75
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:47,290
That means Arsenicum was indicated
on the lower level as well.

76
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:51,810
So you see the possibilities?

77
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:59,670
In all these cases there is some
 effect from the remedy.

78
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:07,460
If you want to add also the possibility
 of placebo as well, here.

79
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:13,930
Because with the placebo you may
have an amelioration of the burning.

80
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,710
-It might be that I missed something
 because you give 3 points

81
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:25,650
and you say first Robinia and Nux Vomica...

82
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:35,770
-Rob and Nux-v touched the case for
1 week, 2 weeks, the burning is better,

83
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:41,460
it comes after 3 weeks and he says
I' m better. The 3rd week says, it's back.

84
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:46,050
 That means the remedy is wrong,
try to find another remedy.

85
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:59,060
You give Rob. or Nux-v and they
will be better for a while.

86
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:06,950
Then you give Nat-m, a third possibility,
the burning goes away but no change

87
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:12,050
at all on the general state of the patient.
Constipation remains the same, anxiety

88
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:23,940
 is the same, fears, whatever pains he
 has is the same, only this layer is gone.

89
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:28,180
Full time amelioration, no
special relief of the patient.

90
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:37,500
That means the remedy is correct, Nat-m
 but you have to find the deeper layer.

91
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,600
-But what is the difference between
 the first and second group?

92
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,640
-Between Rob and Nat-m?

93
00:14:47,740 --> 00:15:00,940
Nat-m cures the gastritis; the other two remedies ameliorate for a while and comes back.

94
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:08,540
Now the third possibility is that you
may be prescribing a remedy that

95
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:17,870
not only will take the gastritis away but
will cure the headaches, the constipation.

96
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:26,690
 That means you touched upon this layer. This layer and that layer is the same, it is Arsenicum.

97
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:43,330
The layer was encompassing,
including the acute situation, is it clear?

98
00:15:53,800 --> 00:16:00,360
-I understood point a and b and then when
you said, when you prescribe a remedy that

99
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:04,200
covers 2 layers, you lost me, sorry.
Can you explain that bit again?

100
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:14,570
-You prescribe Arsenicum which takes away
the gastritis but the person also says,

101
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:20,180
' I feel great; my headaches also are gone.
 My constipation also is gone

102
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:29,710
and I had some anxiety; this also has gone.
 That means the gastritis picture was Ars

103
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:38,740
and the deeper layer was also Ars.
 So Ars touched both layers.

104
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:50,820
I'll tell you something that as we go along
with information you will have to encompass

105
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:57,600
and to include the previous
information in the observation.

106
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:04,530
What we said in the previous seminar
concerning the follow ups

107
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,370
and what happens with the chronic etc.
has to be encompassed now

108
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:16,710
as information which has been digested
and included now in the observation.

109
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:24,100
In order to make a correct observation,
you need the whole information;

110
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:31,730
you don't need this fragmented
observation as we put them down now.

111
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:37,660
You need to come back and to take
 into consideration all the possibilities

112
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:44,180
that we have talked about and then
find out what is really going on.

113
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,490
-If I understand correctly, what you say
 is when we give a wrong remedy

114
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:59,850
or you give an incomplete remedy this is
what we can expect: a full time amelioration

115
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:03,180
 of the symptoms and yet no
special relief for the patient.

116
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:12,390
-No, no, no. I said in case this
happens the remedy is correct.

117
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:19,090
 Full time amelioration of your
 lumbago, you get lumbagos all the time.

118
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:26,960
I give you Nitric acid and your lumbago
 has gone away but no special relief.

119
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:32,920
That means the remedy did not touch
the underlying layer of your case.

120
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:39,140
-I'm sorry I rephrase what I say. It's not the
 wrong remedy for the presenting symptoms

121
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,460
 but not the correct remedy for the patient.

122
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:55,320
-No, it is still the correct remedy. This is something which is my observation.

123
00:18:55,420 --> 00:19:05,070
What is happening actually is that:
in case you have a situation like gastritis,

124
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:15,370
that you treat and it's going very well. That means your remedy was correct for that layer.

125
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:21,980
 The idea is, I try to find the constitutional remedy; so this was not the

126
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,980
constitutional remedy, therefore it
was wrong. This idea is wrong.

127
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:39,710
This idea is a wrong idea in most of
the cases. We have slowly to understand

128
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:45,830
that we have to be talking differently
between the different groups.

129
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:57,660
 When we talk about group 1 then we can be talking if you like about a constitutional remedy.

130
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:06,950
That means a remedy that will cure
acute or chronic conditions all the time.

131
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:15,970
This is a case of Sulphur, ok. He got an influenza, I give Sulphur and comes back.

132
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:19,710
He got pneumonia, I give
Sulphur, he comes back.

133
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:23,800
He got lumbago, I give
Sulphur and comes back.

134
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:37,740
This is only valid for group 1. There is no
such thing when we go down the groups.

135
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:45,260
 In the groups you will see most of the times this situation where you have to give a remedy

136
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:52,270
 which takes away a host of symptoms
without relief of the patient.

137
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:58,790
That means you have to go deeper and
find out what is the underlying remedy.

138
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:20,020
-But can I say perhaps in group 3 if
I gave always the correct remedy for

139
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:29,660
 one layer after the other, then at the end
 I will find the constitutional remedy?

140
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:35,720
-You may call it constitutional
remedy if you like, yes.

141
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,260
-But not in the beginning?

142
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,850
-Not in the beginning and then always
you will have the question,

143
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:49,590
which was the remedy which
mostly helped this patient

144
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:52,740
to be able to call it constitutional remedy?

145
00:21:52,840 --> 00:22:04,560
Because don't forget also that the search
 for the correct remedy never ends.

146
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:12,480
Because you go there and you take these layers away but always there is an underlying layer.

147
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:17,600
As long as you are alive you will
have a layer staying with you

148
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:22,940
where this layer may take
 you up to 90 years old.

149
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:31,540
Because now it's not a severe layer but it's a layer. Still you may be able to go deeper.

150
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:37,930
Even in cases where we say in group 1
that we have a constitutional remedy,

151
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:44,840
Sulphur is indicated. This is theoretical,
 this is rather speculative.

152
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:55,810
In reality what happens is that under Sulphur there is another remedy which we cannot see.

153
00:22:55,910 --> 00:23:00,990
Therefore the relapse all the
time comes to Sulphur picture.

154
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:06,090
But this shows a very strong
organism, that's very good.

155
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:13,220
So we call it constitutional remedy, why? Because the organism who is strong

156
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:18,780
is going to bring out always the same picture.

157
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:30,940
This is a very good sign for an organism
 but this organism has a better possibility,

158
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:40,100
 if we can say, if we find what is under
Sulphur level, maybe it is a Calcarea level.

159
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:46,500
But we don't see it. We cannot find it.

160
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:55,340
So in the search for such layers we
prescribe a lot of wrong remedies, why?

161
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:07,940
Because in order an organism who is strong enough to give underlying layers clearly,

162
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,980
 that means he is going
to live up to 200 years.

163
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:17,090
If an organism gives me all the time
 what is underneath, clearly and I prescribe,

164
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:28,860
 I will keep him young for the rest of his life.
For 150-200 years I don't know how much.

165
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:37,480
That's why it's difficult for me to accept
 that this is the constitutional remedy.

166
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:47,380
The idea of the constitutional remedy is only
to point out that a person is strong enough

167
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:53,460
 to give repeatedly the same picture
 of the remedy. That's all.

168
00:24:53,560 --> 00:25:02,610
In group 2,3 and 4, this, I say, is
almost next to impossible.

169
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:08,820
-I want to ask one more time
and I beg your forgiveness.

170
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:20,680
-I don't know how the presidential
 crisis affects you

171
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:28,250
except that you are
connected with Lewinsky.

172
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:46,660
-I hope everybody is enjoying the show.
I guess the point that I like clarification on...

173
00:25:46,760 --> 00:26:04,050
-What about Lewinsky? She kept the cloth
 there, she said the time will come I'll get him.

174
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:09,040
Nobody talks about Levinsky.

175
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,120
-That comes later.

176
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,950
My question is if we go back to the illustration
of the gastritis giving the Nat-m first

177
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:29,680
and then underneath with the Arsenicum.
Is it the case when the patient first comes

178
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:37,350
 that the gastritis is representing symptoms,
is it the case that the Arsenicum remedy

179
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:50,810
and the picture is not clear or is it there
 and the homeopath doesn't see it?

180
00:26:51,680 --> 00:27:02,570
-No. In case of Nat-m the case is clear.
The prescriber has seen the layer and

181
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,770
has prescribed the correct remedy.

182
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:07,260
- So there is no Arsenicum picture?

183
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:14,710
-No, no. Wait a moment you have
to be very clear about this.

184
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:21,460
Many times I have said, when you have
 an underlying layer and there are some

185
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:28,210
 symptoms going through the layer, you
just have to ignore these two symptoms,

186
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:34,060
the restlessness and the fear of heights
and prescribe the first remedy

187
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:39,950
 which is this. This is the first
remedy we have to prescribe.

188
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:53,940
We didn't prescribe on totality.
We prescribe on Picric acid.

189
00:27:54,040 --> 00:28:08,280
By the way she has the highest mark
in the class, not due to Homeopathy.

190
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:21,550
This remedy is necessary to be given as the
first remedy to uncover the underlying layer.

191
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:27,830
Now if you go and give Calcarea carbonica straight from the beginning, you do nothing.

192
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:36,500
Because Calc is here. You have to
 give Nat-m, Ars., Sep., then Calc.

193
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:44,020
Now Calc is going to act. You give
Calc in the beginning: nothing, Sepia

194
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:49,570
or Ars in the beginning: nothing.

195
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:54,830
Therefore in this case I say Nat-m is the
 correct remedy and is a remedy

196
00:28:54,930 --> 00:29:04,110
which has been seen from the
symptomatology. It's clear for an expert.

197
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:08,460
Here it's never clear for one who
 doesn't know of course.

198
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:12,620
If somebody comes outside
the class and hear, will say

199
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,600
"what are you talking, they are crazy
 people talking about these things".

200
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:22,050
But one who knows follows and understands.

201
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:32,640
The main issue here is burning in the
stomach. I will concentrate on that gastritis

202
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,130
and I have a picture of Nat-m,
ok I prescribe though underneath

203
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:48,130
I have symptoms of Sepia. I can see that
 this man is disinterested in sexual matters,

204
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:58,890
I see also that he has some slowness.
So Nat-m and then Sepia.

205
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:07,120
So if you give Sepia which is the second
remedy you just disrupt the case,

206
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:15,980
bring some aggravations and some little disturbances. Not the right sequence.

207
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:22,840
In this case Arsenicum was the first
 layer and underneath was Arsenicum again.

208
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,310
Sepia is underneath and you
give Sepia and it works.

209
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:34,150
Is it still possible that Arsenicum
comes up again and again?

210
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,060
-I don't understand the question.

211
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:46,440
-Ars layer is so strong that comes through
again and again throughout his life time.

212
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:54,570
-Afterwards yes, sure.
Ars maybe a constitutional remedy.

213
00:30:54,670 --> 00:31:04,550
Maybe this case is here, up there and Ars
 will come back again and again.

214
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:16,950
Wait a moment, maybe it is not
clear what I said about Arsenicum.

215
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:27,780
Arsenicum is not two layers.
Still Arsenicum is this layer.

216
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:38,920
these are the acute symptoms of gastritis
and these are the general symptoms

217
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:52,060
and these are the general symptoms of the patient. They all fit to Ars; this is what I said.

218
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:59,760
The acute symptoms plus the general symptoms and what we call the constitutional symptoms

219
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:06,100
of the patient all fit in the picture of Ars.

220
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,580
Because here we have been talking
about 2,3 different layers.

221
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:22,220
When the Arsenicum touches the deeper level, that means the general symptoms of the patient

222
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:28,180
and also the acute symptoms of the patient, belong to the same remedy.

223
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:35,660
That' s why it touches on a deeper level.
It cures what is on the uppermost

224
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:41,680
and cures underneath, as well, is it clear?

225
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:57,500
-If I give the Ars the first time instead
of the Nat-m will it work or not?

226
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:10,610
-That's another case. In case there is
a Nat-m layer, you have to give Nat-m.

227
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:19,990
Under Nat-m, don't use the word
Arsenicum use the word Sepia.

228
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:28,580
First you need Nat-m and then Sepia.

229
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:50,970
In case of Ars., the Nat-m
layer does not exist.

230
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:57,110
If you give Nat-m nothing will happen.

231
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:10,530
I see some big questionmarks in the eyes.

232
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:17,060
-I think there was a misunderstanding
with this, a little bit.

233
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:21,500
From her question what I understood
 in this example was like when you

234
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:30,340
take away this layer and it's gone,
 then you go to the next one,

235
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,100
 can it be that this comes back again?

236
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:38,930
-This Natrum Muriaticum?

237
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:44,730
-After you've gone to the next layer?

238
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,210
-After Sepia?

239
00:34:47,310 --> 00:35:06,500
-No. Normally once you've given
Sepia, the Nat-m layer should not come.

240
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:10,870
When there is a relapse should
be the relapse on Sepia.

241
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:25,140
But there are some cases in which we
may observe that they need a rotation of

242
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:40,260
the remedies what Kent was talking
about a rotation, like: Sulph-Calc-Lyc.

243
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:53,780
What that means is that you gave Sulph, then you needed Calc and then you needed Lyc.

244
00:35:53,880 --> 00:36:06,420
Then again you need Sulphur. In such
 a case your observation should be that

245
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:19,320
the new cycle now that starts, on the whole,
is a much better state of health than original.

246
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:26,820
You may start again but it's on
another level the cycle.

247
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:35,970
It's not a coming back of the original
situation.It is a much better situation.

248
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:48,770
So you may need actually Puls. here
and you may need Puls again here,

249
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:58,350
when you are quite well actually. The
picture may come back to Pulsatilla

250
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:04,440
but you are in a much better condition.

251
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:17,460
- In a case I have given a remedy and
physical symptoms got better first

252
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:23,600
and besides that the emotional
symptoms got better as well.

253
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:30,300
Then the physical symptoms come
 back and the emotional stay good;

254
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:35,300
so the patient can cope better
with the physical symptoms.

255
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:41,420
So this is whould be
really a success you say.

256
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:52,340
But then the physical symptoms get worse and worse and the energy goes down as well.

257
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,760
So we really should look for
another remedy, is that right?

258
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:07,400
-Yes, you go here and you see
the last remedy, the Calc or that or that.

259
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:16,080
What I say is that when you have
ameliorated the state quite well,

260
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:28,200
still the original Puls case
may come back as Puls picture.

261
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:34,540
-We don't talk about the potency.

262
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:45,130
-I don't want to mix the subjects because
 this is quite difficult. We'll talk later on.

263
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:03,720
-Is it right then to prescribe a
remedy as long as it is acting?

264
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:09,550
Even if I already see some
symptoms leading to the remedy

265
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:12,840
of the next layer or the deeper layer?

266
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:21,560
-If the remedy which you prescribe
 is acting that means that still the picture

267
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:29,450
is the original picture even if you think that
maybe is going towards another remedy.

268
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:38,940
Actually the picture is still the original.
When it stops acting and you have some

269
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:44,450
indications for a new remedy, then
you prescribe the new remedy,

270
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:50,820
 you stop the previous one
and you prescribe the new.

271
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:04,160
-I would like to go back to the description
 you said about Sulphur

272
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:10,900
that all the time comes again and again.
Then in the end you said something about,

273
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:17,680
 there is another layer underneath and
 if you give this layer the person will die?

274
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:24,040
-No, he will live for ever, the opposite.

275
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:38,400
I said, if you have a good case,
Sulphur case, and you prescribe for years

276
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:43,500
and you treat everything with
Sulphur and he's doing very well

277
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:52,540
I said even in this case there is a possibility
 to find what is underlying Sulphur,

278
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:56,430
so the relapse will not come anymore
to Sulphur, it will come to Calc.

279
00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:02,100
In such a case the person lives forever.

280
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:09,600
 I said, in such a case the person
will live for a very long time.

281
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:40,740
It is necessary to take this information
and process it and keep it in your mind

282
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:45,200
 in order to be able to
make a judgment finally.

283
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,210
-If I understood right what you said,
then this means that you cannot make

284
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:57,500
big mistakes by repeating the same remedy. Either it acts if you are on the same layer or

285
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:01,910
 it doesn't act and then you have
 to search for a new remedy.

286
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:15,820
-Big mistakes, no. But you can make a mistake. It can do some damage in the picture

287
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:24,660
if you repeat unnecessarily for long
time depending also on the case.

288
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:33,510
Because you will see the repetition of a
remedy on group 1 has no the same effect

289
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:40,780
as the repetition of the remedy in
number 3 group.When we can repeat or

290
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:47,910
we cannot repeat and do damage as little
as possible, this is a big issue as well.

291
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:59,000
We can not make a general idea. With the
first group you repeat as long as you like.

292
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:06,240
With the second group by repeating too
much, you can change the picture.

293
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:10,670
On the third group you
can change the picture.

294
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:23,450
The 8 observation of Kent was that:
 some patients prove every remedy they get.

295
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,110
What are you going to do with this?

296
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:47,380
These are the sensitive patients, usually their cases are mixed up by too many remedies.

297
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:56,950
The management of such cases is
 that you will have to give placebo

298
00:43:57,050 --> 00:44:04,690
as long as possible until you
really see a good picture

299
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:15,380
of the remedy and then prescribe only
one dose and only in lower potencies,

300
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:25,910
up to 200 the highest. Don't repeat the remedy
 if you see somebody is proving, really proving.

301
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:37,400
You give a Nat-m and he comes back with no amelioration, but with some symptoms of Nat.m

302
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:43,030
Then you give Ignatia and no
amelioration and he comes back

303
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:46,270
with some symptoms of Ignatia, Sepia etc.

304
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:53,630
Be careful, start giving placebo, make a
good study of the case and when you give,

305
00:44:53,730 --> 00:45:01,480
just give a dose of 30 and see,
observe and a lot of placebo.

306
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:14,360
The action of the medicines upon provers.

307
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:24,740
-A point regarding some patients prove every remedy they get and this is Kent's observations.

308
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:31,380
I have found and this is my experience that when I have a patient who has that kind of sensitivity

309
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:36,610
even to very low potencies, I found
 that by administering LM potencies

310
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:39,780
they have much more tolerance
 and they do much less proving.

311
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:43,470
 And because Kent didn't have
 access to the sixth edition,

312
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:51,350
 he had no knowledge
 of water administrations.

313
00:45:51,450 --> 00:46:00,610
-Maybe. The LM potencies are milder
 and therefore you can use them.

314
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:16,500
The action of the medicines upon provers,
 what is this? Is it good or bad?

315
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:25,560
-Kent writes that every proving that is good
 for the prover comes towards health.

316
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:54,520
-Why? To prove a remedy is a good
thing for the organism, why?

317
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:11,520
-Because it stimulates the organism by repeating, it brings the vital force higher.

318
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:28,160
-I think everybody has a little bit of
things and it brings it up as he said it.

319
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:35,690
At my point of view it does something even if
you suffer so much it brings you up everytime.

320
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:47,500
-I think he said, provers have to be
quite healthy. Otherwise it would mean that

321
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:53,530
people who got a lot of remedies
 must be very healthy.

322
00:47:54,280 --> 00:48:00,770
-First of all a lot of remedies is no good.
A proving has to be done

323
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:09,170
according to certain laws. A prover
 brings out some symptoms.

324
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:20,290
These symptoms have to go away before
 he can start proving another remedy.

325
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:29,030
If you start proving one remedy and a week
 later you prove another and another,

326
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:34,220
then you can cause a confusion.

327
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:42,730
The symptoms of the proving have to go out,
wait and then you can prove another remedy.

328
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:48,660
But why is it good to do a proving?

329
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:54,140
-I doubt a little bit. I remember when
you talked about Kent and you said

330
00:48:54,240 --> 00:49:02,290
he was gone at early age in the other land
but he has taken too many provings.

331
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:17,880
So I don't know if the proving has really damaged him or the provings give really a better condition?

332
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:27,940
-What happened with Kent, I think, Kent
did not trust anybody else to treat him

333
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:35,500
because he knew better than anybody else. Therefore whatever symptoms he would

334
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:41,200
give to anybody, he would first
think himself about the remedy.

335
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:46,450
So a person like that is very difficult
 to be treated by somebody else.

336
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:55,600
So Kent most probably was treating himself
all along, all the time and when he came to

337
00:49:55,700 --> 00:50:02,600
the point where he had this pneumonia,
 most probably he mistreated himself

338
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:07,360
and in the end some friends or
disciples who came to treat him,

339
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:13,990
could not find the remedy as well.
That means that Kent had taken a lot of

340
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:23,330
wrong remedies for himself and also he
had taken some remedies for provings.

341
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:35,100
Kent had bad experience from what he writes.
 He had bad experience with high potencies.

342
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:40,280
 He says, don't use high potency just
like that, it is quite a serious matter.

343
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:48,300
 From his own experience he
had that information.

344
00:50:48,400 --> 00:51:02,100
But at the same time he wrote that a prover
can improve his health by doing provings.

345
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:08,240
What is the logic behind such a thing?

346
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:12,380
-He already explained to us, a prover
 can only develop symptoms

347
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:20,130
 if he is in the same frequency like the remedy.
This frequency is going to improve his health,

348
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:27,370
 it's going to stimulate his health and
so his health is going to improve.

349
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:38,660
If he is not in this level of resonancy, of frequency of this remedy, he won't produce any symptoms.

350
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:46,980
-It is an exercise of a primary action.
Because the organism is supposed to intake

351
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:54,340
that influence of the so-called given
material and do something with it

352
00:51:54,440 --> 00:52:05,320
 and the primary action is basic reaction of the organism; so any exercise with it is good for us.

353
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:18,690
-So an exercise of the organism. You see my understanding of the proving is like this:

354
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:28,970
Take the idea of vaccination.
In vaccination they had this idea that

355
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:41,590
if we give the vaccine the organism will react
in a positive manner, producing antibodies etc.

356
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:48,790
The problem that they did not calculate
 was that the vaccine was already

357
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:55,380
a too strong substance for the organism.
And the reaction of the organism

358
00:52:55,480 --> 00:53:06,200
it might have been actually pathological.
They didn't take into consideration this fact.

359
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:19,420
With Homeopathy we have the same idea
 of vaccination but in a much milder form.

360
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:36,620
If the organism is prepared to get diseased
 after a year or 2 or 3 but if this organism

361
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:43,680
 is stimulated or strengthened maybe
he will not fall sick after 3 years,

362
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:48,980
 he will fall sick after
10 years. How is that?

363
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:58,980
Because the remedy brings out symptoms
 which most probably he was going to

364
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:07,310
develop in the future, the sensitive
to this particular medicine.

365
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:14,740
So most probably those symptoms
he was going to develop

366
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:25,080
and this is a kind of a protection
 like prophylaxis.

367
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:30,800
So if you cover by doing a lot of provings,

368
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:37,540
 if you cover a lot of the possibilities of
the organism to develop symptomatology

369
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:42,400
you prevent, it is a preventive
medicine, you prevent these

370
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:50,680
symptoms from arising at
least in the near future.

371
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,730
You don't understand?

372
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:25,140
-But frequently we said it's not
possible to make a kind of vaccination

373
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,910
with Homeopathy to give as
a prophylaxis if some people

374
00:55:28,010 --> 00:55:34,270
are travelling, at malaria, to prevent
 future symptoms. But now you said

375
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:39,260
it's a kind of prophylaxis you can
 do to prevent future symptoms.

376
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:44,210
So in fact it would be
possible what you said now.

377
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:49,800
-What I say is, if you want to make a
 prophylaxis for yellow fever or

378
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:56,370
smallpox or things like that and
 then you give Thuja for prophylaxis

379
00:55:56,470 --> 00:56:08,620
 of smallpox this is wrong as an idea, why?
Because by giving Thuja to all the population

380
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:19,860
 and say everyone who may get smallpox,
 all of you get symptoms of Thuja,

381
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:29,120
 this is wrong as an idea for Homeopathy.
When the whole class develops smallpox,

382
00:56:30,030 --> 00:56:37,940
 some will develop Thuja symptoms.
For those who will develop Thuja symptoms

383
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:46,420
maybe Thuja might be prophylactic.
But only for that small portion of the population

384
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:52,900
 but you cannot come and say,
ok instead of giving the vaccination

385
00:56:52,980 --> 00:57:00,750
I will give you Thuja to protect you for smallpox. This is wrong idea, this is what I have said.

386
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:13,400
-But the rest is not prone to
smallpox anyway, so it wouldn't get it.

387
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:27,570
-I said, let us say everybody gets smallpox
 but the whole island will not get it.

388
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:32,820
In the island 200 people out of 2000
will get smallpox.

389
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:40,460
Now these people, these 200, they get
different remedies, not only Thuja.

390
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:46,520
Some will get Belladonna,
Lachesis, Calcarea etc.

391
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:56,840
Now for the small group that would have needed Thuja, maybe Thuja can be a prophylaxis

392
00:57:56,940 --> 00:58:04,350
but how can you know who needs what
to distribute and say I will protect you

393
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:09,090
with the homeopathic remedy
instead of getting the vaccination.

394
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:16,360
You cannot say that. I have said this is
wrong as an idea, theoretically is wrong.

395
00:58:17,810 --> 00:58:26,900
Now we come to the provers and we say, if you are a prover and you develop some symptoms

396
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,340
out of the remedy, this might
be your predisposition.

397
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:38,720
You develop headaches, frequent urination, burning in the stomach with the remedy.

398
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:47,420
This is your predisposition. By doing this
proving you cut short this predisposition.

399
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:52,050
It's like strengthening your
organism towards this direction.

400
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:56,300
Then you do another proving and still you
 have some reactions on another remedy;

401
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:05,540
still you cover symptoms that
you may had developed naturally

402
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:13,920
 in the course of your
 life as a disease, clear?

403
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:28,820
You have to ask these questions because
 when I speak I do not speak in every detail.

404
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:33,430
 I think that you understand everything
 else which maybe is not true.

405
00:59:34,350 --> 00:59:42,080
-One question. Proving or to take
a remedy is artificial disease.

406
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:20,500
Every remedy I take gives me energy.
I think that everybody has a lot of energy

407
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:29,650
 more or less and every artificial disease
I give him, brings him down to energy level.

408
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:34,020
And therefore when I make a lot of provings I have to ask when he comes back after the

409
01:00:34,190 --> 01:00:38,270
proving, if he has the same level of
energy as he had before this proving

410
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:42,220
or if he has better energy.
And I have a lot of energy,

411
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:48,810
 I can spend or not; I spend a lot of energy
 in this way and I can decline earlier

412
01:00:48,910 --> 01:00:54,800
than if I had not done these provings.
 This is a kind of prophylaxis because I have

413
01:00:54,900 --> 01:01:04,960
 a need to do it. I take a
 prophylactic remedy when it is possible.

414
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:22,600
-Just a moment when you say
the remedy gives or takes energy.

415
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:31,990
This is wrong as a perception. The remedy
 does not give or takes energy from you.

416
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:45,020
The remedy frees your energy
 in case it is blocked by disease

417
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:56,590
or the provers are stimulated in their
energy to produce a certain symptomatology.

418
01:01:56,690 --> 01:02:08,220
In such a case even if the prover
says, 'I feel tired', it is one symptom,

419
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:13,520
he feels difficult to wake up, it's another
symptom which he did not have before.

420
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:22,610
You think it took away energy;
no it didn't take away energy.

421
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:26,340
It has produced the picture of the remedy.

422
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:35,240
You wait, the picture goes away and
 he comes back to the state he was before.

423
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:43,930
It's not a matter of taking away energy or giving energy. The remedy cannot give energy.

424
01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:49,240
It cannot boost your energy.  Your energy
is there and it is unblocked, it's freed.

425
01:02:54,280 --> 01:03:07,600
and then you feel the energy. When your liver
 is not working properly, your energy is low

426
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:15,660
but the remedy will cure your liver and
then the liver will produce more energy.

427
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:28,470
-Mr.Vithoulkas there is a total mess now in
my head and I believe not only in my head.

428
01:03:28,570 --> 01:03:35,740
May I ask a question regarding these things
which you wrote about the predisposition level.

429
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:45,750
 Let's suppose that this prover he is
almost in perfect condition of his health

430
01:03:45,850 --> 01:03:54,460
and there is a certain defense lines like this Arsenicum and more and more deeper,

431
01:03:54,560 --> 01:04:04,780
some level layers where the defense mechanism would go back under some short of stressors.

432
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:12,690
In that case we start giving the person
some remedies and look for his reaction

433
01:04:12,790 --> 01:04:23,420
and see the results of provings.
We use this person for provings.

434
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:29,270
-Not different remedies, just one
remedy you give for the proving.

435
01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:34,430
-First you give one remedy, then
you wait for a couple of years,

436
01:04:34,530 --> 01:04:39,940
you remember that he was healthy,
let's try him again.

437
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:49,770
In that case if we give him some remedy which has nothing in common with his defense line;

438
01:04:49,870 --> 01:04:55,530
after a couple of months we can
use him again, am I right?

439
01:04:57,080 --> 01:05:00,220
It will be some reaction in his
organism but not really deep one

440
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:03,940
and he will recover very
fast after these provings.

441
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:12,290
-Wait here I will explain to you something
so you may understand more clearly.

442
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:22,350
In a proving we have this
person with these layers.

443
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:31,030
 If he has so many layers it is better
not to make a proving but anyhow.

444
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:38,100
Let us say, in spite the fact he says,
'I feel ok I do a proving'.

445
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:46,350
You give him a remedy which is not his first
layer. This person has symptoms now.

446
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:59,700
This person is not really healthy but
you give a remedy that is not

447
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:02,560
his own remedy of his first layer.

448
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:15,890
 Either it is too far, produces
nothing or it is quite close,

449
01:06:15,990 --> 01:06:22,480
you give Arsenicum, close but not
exact and produce symptoms of

450
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:33,320
Ars in this person. Now the fact that you
gave Ars and you did not cure him

451
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:45,710
but it was close so it can stimulate his defence and you wait until these symptoms go away,

452
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:57,040
we still say, this is a process which
is quite safe and actually it may still

453
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:03,380
improve the health of such
a person. Is it clear?

454
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:15,350
-When is anybody healthy enough to
 be able to participate in a proving?

455
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:19,230
The most people I know are in
some stage of a chronic treatment

456
01:07:19,330 --> 01:07:25,460
 of their diseases and go backwards layer
 by layer but they all take remedies.

457
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:33,910
-That is true concerning the
population in which we live;

458
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:39,620
we do not anymore have a state of
health which used to be with

459
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:50,460
Hahnemann's times. For instance the
best people to do provings would be

460
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:57,970
the South Americans and not the
Argentineans so much.

461
01:07:58,070 --> 01:08:05,910
They started already to be degenerated
 but the middle South American people,

462
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:13,440
the African people and some Asians
 like Malaysians, Philippinos,

463
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:20,180
these races are good for
provings at this moment.

464
01:08:22,390 --> 01:08:32,300
What happens here in a person like this,
with 5 layers, you give the similar remedy,

465
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:39,610
then it may change some of his graph
up here. And you take these changes

466
01:08:39,710 --> 01:08:46,760
as belonging to the remedy. Where
the pure remedy effect is different.

467
01:08:46,860 --> 01:08:55,460
Here you have apart from one or two new symptoms, you have also managed

468
01:08:55,480 --> 01:09:04,020
to distort some of his original symptoms.
And this distortion you call it a proving.

469
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:10,020
That is what is happening with some
 provings which are happening today

470
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:21,180
where a dose of C30 was given to
the whole class and everybody

471
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:32,200
 develops from 100 symptoms to 3000,
 it's not possible. This kind of proving

472
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:38,940
with one remedy to the whole class and
the whole class developing all these symptoms

473
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:47,710
 which are published today in books,
are useless information and I would say

474
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:52,450
misinformation and we have to
be very very careful.

475
01:09:52,550 --> 01:09:56,860
But you will say, the remedy does
not have some symptoms?

476
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:05,800
Yes sure but out of all these symptoms
 published, who is in a position to tell

477
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:12,670
which one of these 3000 are the real
ones that belong to the remedy? Nobody.

478
01:10:12,770 --> 01:10:19,900
So this misinformation is worse than
no information. You have to redo

479
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:27,920
again and again before you refine
the real symptoms that belong to

480
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:33,070
the remedy and do not belong
to the fantasy of the provers or

481
01:10:33,170 --> 01:10:41,130
to the distortion of their own symptomatology.
She is right when she says there are

482
01:10:41,610 --> 01:10:49,530
very few people on which you can do
real provings today, very few.

483
01:11:00,650 --> 01:11:13,620
We have to be careful. Many times you
make a lot of mistakes with this.

484
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:21,210
-I have question about the lack of vitality or healthy provers for provings in western

485
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:26,550
civilization, how do you account for the
fact that recent provings that are conducted

486
01:11:26,650 --> 01:11:34,570
 in a strictly classical homeopathic basis
as Hahnemann ...when these remedies

487
01:11:34,670 --> 01:11:38,540
are proving and are written up, how do
you count for the fact that do help

488
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:42,780
 many patients that seem
 to be indicated for it?

489
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:53,660
-I can give you only sac lac and tell you
 that this remedy has these symptoms

490
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:59,020
and you give it to 1000 cases and
 I'm sure you will find 5 cases

491
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:01,860
 who will come back and say, 'I'm better'.

492
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:11,860
This is not a proof that this remedy really was helping because the fact that the patient

493
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:21,650
comes and is suggestible and the fact that you are strong personality and say, this is going to help you,

494
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:26,030
the patient may come and say, 'I'm better'.

495
01:12:26,130 --> 01:12:33,260
That does not mean anything for me.
Unless you see the process in the cure

496
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:40,000
which I would like to see according
to these laws the fact that you have

497
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:46,580
published some cases, saying
 'I gave this, he saw this dream and

498
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:50,500
because of the dream I gave
this remedy and he was cured'.

499
01:12:50,600 --> 01:13:00,180
If this was cure it is a big question mark.
But every remedy has some symptoms

500
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:07,260
and within the provers maybe one prover
is producing the real symptoms

501
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:14,750
 but these real symptoms are
masked in the bulk of nonsense

502
01:13:14,850 --> 01:13:16,760
which is going into the proving;

503
01:13:17,050 --> 01:13:21,940
how can you find out? They are definitely
 some symptoms belonging

504
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:25,100
to the remedy, but which ones?

505
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:34,290
This is my problem and this is what I have criticized very severely to everyone

506
01:13:34,390 --> 01:13:39,100
who is doing proving. Either you do it
properly or don't do it at all.

507
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:45,130
Because all this misinformation goes
 into our books, goes into Repertories.

508
01:13:52,460 --> 01:13:58,180
That is not science.

509
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:16,110
With the provings, many times you
give a remedy and you have typical

510
01:14:16,210 --> 01:14:23,120
symptoms of the remedy,
is this a proving yes or no?

511
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:26,020
-It's a proving.

512
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:33,100
I will tell you not only it's not a proving but
it is a sign that the remedy was correct.

513
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:48,210
It is a seal that the remedy you gave
was correct. In which case?

514
01:14:48,310 --> 01:14:59,780
In the case where the general state of the patient is better and his condition is ameliorated.

515
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:07,780
You cannot say just because he had some symptoms of the remedy, this is a proving.

516
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:13,980
The person is getting better, his disease is getting better what do you mean is a proving?

517
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:21,020
On the contrary, that manifestation
 of the symptoms of the remedy,

518
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:29,710
is a seal that your remedy was absolutely
 in the center and creates of course

519
01:15:29,810 --> 01:15:41,040
 some extra symptoms of the remedy, for a little period of time and it will go away, don't bother.

520
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:51,720
In the other case it is when you have these symptoms of the remedy but no amelioration,

521
01:15:51,820 --> 01:16:02,770
no difference in his condition, that is
a proving. Only then it's a proving, clear?

522
01:16:13,110 --> 01:16:20,660
-Would you say that in contemporary provings, provers who are from western civilization,

523
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:27,630
 that if a significant number of the provers had similar symptoms, that that would give

524
01:16:27,730 --> 01:16:34,380
validity to those particular symptoms?
For example if you have 20 provers and

525
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:41,800
in the course of proving there was fatigue
at 8 o'clock in the evening and 2 o'clock

526
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:46,140
 in the afternoon and out of the 20 let's
 say 8-12 had those particular symptoms,

527
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:49,750
would you then agree that those would
become legitimate symptoms of

528
01:16:49,850 --> 01:16:52,820
that particular remedy that has been proven?

529
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:57,810
-As long as the proving is conducted properly.

530
01:16:57,910 --> 01:17:00,140
-Yes according to Hahnemann's rules.

531
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:09,330
-Because if we are in a group and we talk each other and you say, today I have a headache,

532
01:17:09,430 --> 01:17:15,740
we have taken the same remedy.
I think also I have a headache and then it

533
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:25,180
 starts like this, of course this is not a proving because one affecting the other you come

534
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:31,920
and you have 80% with a headache
 on the right side. This I don't agree but

535
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:43,530
 if it is conducted properly and 80% of the provers, I doubt if that can ever happen,

536
01:17:43,630 --> 01:17:49,730
 can have one symptom, definitely
that belongs to the remedy.

537
01:17:52,890 --> 01:18:01,300
-Under this aspect how can I judge
 the value of our Materia Medica's today

538
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:05,420
and also of the Repertory? If you look at synthesis for example it is constantly being

539
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:12,370
updated with all this information of contemporary provings. How am I supposed to judge?

540
01:18:12,470 --> 01:18:25,770
-Exactly. 25 days before we had a meeting
 here which we call the teachers meeting.

541
01:18:25,870 --> 01:18:37,160
In this meeting we discussed the subject
of reliability of Materia Medica symptoms

542
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:48,300
 and the Repertory symptoms. And we tried
 to find a way to clarify this information and

543
01:18:48,400 --> 01:19:00,220
to reevaluate and to find a system to
confirm every symptom that exists

544
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:04,000
in the Materia Medica and the Repertory.
We came to different conclusions,

545
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:14,370
 maybe we can meet and I can give
 you the résumé of the situation.

546
01:19:14,470 --> 01:19:24,200
It is a very complicated matter to clarify and to confirm the symptoms of the Materia Medica

547
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:32,140
and to say, that symptom you can rely, that symptom, forget it. It's a very difficult issue.

548
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:42,930
That's why I say, please don't do superficial provings that will bring more rubbish

549
01:19:43,030 --> 01:19:49,180
 into the Materia Medica, we have enough.
If we keep on bringing rubbish into the

550
01:19:49,670 --> 01:19:56,390
 Materia Medica or the Repertory we reach a point where the rubbish will be much more

551
01:19:56,490 --> 01:20:03,900
than the reliable symptoms, and then forget finding the remedy, especially the younger.

552
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:10,150
That is why it is so serious if we do
provings to do it in a serious manner.

553
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:21,260
How can we know? I'm not able to
know, what about a new comer?

554
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:26,180
How can he differentiate? He sees
there something written and then

555
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:32,060
he takes it into consideration. And that
 is why in this teaching I brought you

556
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:46,040
 back to the basics of the Materia Medica.
These are a few things on which you can rely.

557
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:51,280
Because of that danger. The danger is
so tremendous that you may be giving

558
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:57,790
remedy after remedy and the patient coming back and say, I'm better and better with any

559
01:20:57,890 --> 01:21:08,340
remedy you give and really staying in the
same state in which he was originally.

560
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:19,620
There is a big battle with scientific Homeopathy.

561
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:29,130
Because maybe I have information in my
 mind and my experience but how to give it,

562
01:21:29,230 --> 01:21:41,080
how to organize it and give it out to make
it usable by the students, is a big issue.

563
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:47,970
You see now as we go more and more into
the theory, you will make a head like this.

564
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:56,200
The previous group were the Italians here
 and the Italians like to go in mathematics

565
01:21:56,300 --> 01:22:09,880
and they came out with a head like this.
 If this is the experience, you have to learn it,

566
01:22:09,980 --> 01:22:16,000
 you have to accumulate in order
to be able to treat properly;

567
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:24,290
otherwise you stay on a superficial
 level and you give many times...

568
01:22:25,380 --> 01:22:35,370
If you can not evaluate the effect of your treatment, forget the real cure of the patient.

569
01:22:35,470 --> 01:22:41,070
You take him after 3 years and he is
in the same state in spite of the fact

570
01:22:41,170 --> 01:22:46,070
for every remedy you gave
 he said, I'm better.

571
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:54,540
-I want to come back to what happened with
 S. because I'm not clear about this.

572
01:22:54,640 --> 01:23:03,620
How can it be that in the proving, it was Magnesium, and she gets a depression?

573
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:12,170
-I don't know the situation. If I had examined
 by that time S. and we had talked

574
01:23:12,270 --> 01:23:19,530
about her life at the moment, what has happened outside of the influence of the remedy etc.

575
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:21,700
Maybe I will give you this cancer case to
show you how the cancer came to a cure.

576
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:27,730
She was dying, she was in the
last stages with metastasis.

577
01:24:27,830 --> 01:24:40,750
She comes here and says, now 'I have
 a depression' and then I said,

578
01:24:40,850 --> 01:24:47,210
'did you have depression before?',
She said, 'that is how the cancer started'.

579
01:24:47,310 --> 01:24:57,920
The class did not know yet this theory.
She said, this is how the cancer started.

580
01:24:58,020 --> 01:25:06,350
'It started when I had an affair with
a man older than me whom

581
01:25:06,450 --> 01:25:12,640
I trusted very much, whom I loved,
whom I gave everything and

582
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:21,530
he left me and I could not get
out of that depression'.

583
01:25:21,780 --> 01:25:31,020
So the depression continued until
cancer developed, in the ovaries

584
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:40,590
and then metastasis to the uterus and when
 I found the case it was in a terrible state,

585
01:25:40,690 --> 01:25:48,590
not moving anyway. We treated for 2
years and then she comes and says,

586
01:25:48,690 --> 01:26:01,430
'I came to a point when I entered into
depression and then I took Aurum

587
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:17,070
 and I am better'. She is better yes.
But the treatment of the cancer

588
01:26:17,170 --> 01:26:23,100
 if it was not correct would not bring
back the state of the depression

589
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:34,350
in which she was 15 years ago. Now we
can say she is really better once

590
01:26:34,450 --> 01:26:41,360
she has come back to the state where she was, that state of depression was also treated

591
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:52,200
and now she says, 'I feel very well, no
pains, I have energy, I have everything'.

592
01:26:54,670 --> 01:27:03,520
No chemotherapy, just Homeopathy.

593
01:27:05,510 --> 01:27:12,450
-Is it the only possible course for a cure
to bring back the chronological order or

594
01:27:12,550 --> 01:27:23,780
is it also possible to develop another way?
Is it necessary always to go back?

595
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:33,870
-Necessary as long as we have
cases on lower groups here.

596
01:27:33,970 --> 01:27:44,960
Here, we have cancer which can be
cured without bringing back anything.

597
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:53,790
-If you have a case of tinea capitis
which then goes to tumor in the brain

598
01:27:53,890 --> 01:28:00,620
and then goes to depression. If you want
to cure the depression would you expect

599
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:05,840
the tinea to come back again?

600
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:12,500
-Yes because the tinea was suppressed
 and caused the tumor.

601
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:19,060
Otherwise if it was not suppressed
would not cause the tumor.

602
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:29,200
Maybe the organism with the right remedy
 would just go to the tinea straight away.

603
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:41,550
Is it clear what you hear? Ask.

604
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:55,180
-I don't know if I understood the case
she was presenting, the tinea case.

605
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:58,030
You get tinea, then you get the tumor
 and then depression.

606
01:28:58,130 --> 01:29:02,610
If you treat depression, then you
expect tinea to come back first?

607
01:29:02,710 --> 01:29:05,470
I expect the tumor to come back.

608
01:29:05,570 --> 01:29:14,030
-If the tumor was a natural development
of disease, yes. If it was a suppression

609
01:29:14,130 --> 01:29:21,000
because of some cortisone or whatever
 if it is the result of the suppression maybe

610
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:31,040
you will not get through this phase.
You will go to the original disease.

611
01:29:44,210 --> 01:29:52,510
Everybody is depressed.
General depression of the class.

612
01:29:54,400 --> 01:30:01,780
-If for example an old person gets back through all these phases and finally got well again

613
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:08,850
and then for example, the surroundings, the
whole family doesn't accept this new state

614
01:30:08,950 --> 01:30:09,300
 and this person falls into a deep
depression because of this, then the patient

615
01:30:15,960 --> 01:30:26,350
will need a new remedy to stand up towards the family or does the family need to be treated?

616
01:30:26,450 --> 01:30:37,700
-Both. It is a matter of what I have
called, 20 years ago, family dynamics.

617
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:47,040
 Family dynamics develop within a family once there is a person who has some problems.

618
01:30:47,140 --> 01:30:56,360
Family dynamics develop between a woman
who is Staphysagria and a man who is Nux-v.

619
01:30:56,460 --> 01:31:03,400
They develop a family dynamic which
if you treat one of the two persons,

620
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:08,290
 especially the woman, this
dynamic is going to be disturbed

621
01:31:08,390 --> 01:31:12,530
and you are going to have repercussions.

622
01:31:13,490 --> 01:31:20,600
That means the woman suddenly stands
up to the man who is a Nux-v and says

623
01:31:20,700 --> 01:31:29,940
'I had enough, I can't stand anymore
you shouting' and the man says,

624
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:36,940
'what is this now,
how do you dare? '

625
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:46,990
And then there is the family dynamic where
the woman comes back to Staphysagria

626
01:31:47,090 --> 01:31:52,530
and then the family dynamic is re-
established and everybody is happy.

627
01:31:52,630 --> 01:32:02,390
The other possibility is the woman would not be able to stand this and just leaves the marriage.

628
01:32:02,490 --> 01:32:06,740
The third possibility is treat the
husband as well and then of course

629
01:32:07,630 --> 01:32:11,180
 if the chemistry is there,
they will not separate.

630
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:19,950
But in the same way a family that has a child
who is sick they develop a protectiveness,

631
01:32:20,050 --> 01:32:25,880
the mother, they have a mission now they
 have to protect the child and the child

632
01:32:25,980 --> 01:32:30,930
gets big enough and becomes independent
 and the mother says, 'where am I?

633
01:32:31,030 --> 01:32:38,340
What am I doing now? I'm lost' and she
goes into depression and she will try

634
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:43,310
 to bring back the state of the child to be sick, subconsciously, you have to be aware

635
01:32:45,410 --> 01:32:53,400
of these issues. You see the mother really,
she does not support the treatment.

636
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:57,960
She says, 'why don't you give it
some cortisone?', She knows cortisone

637
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:10,440
is going to bring back the situation. 'Do you
think maybe we have to give some cortisone?'

638
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:15,260
And you say, my god I have explained,
I have done so much work and still

639
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:21,530
she comes back with
 that cortisone idea, why?

640
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:28,470
It's family dynamic, she does not want to
lose the mission. She has the mission of

641
01:33:28,570 --> 01:33:39,800
protecting that child. She took that role because
of the child being sick and now she does not

642
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:49,050
 know what to do, she is lost.
'What is my mission, what am I going to do?'

643
01:33:51,540 --> 01:33:57,290
So family dynamics is a big
issue that we have to take into

644
01:33:57,390 --> 01:34:03,460
in consideration when you treat
somebody especially chronically ill people

645
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:10,960
and at the same time educate the parents
or treat the parents or treat the husband

646
01:34:11,060 --> 01:34:21,420
or the surrounding situation in order to keep
the best possible balance in the family.

647
01:34:22,520 --> 01:34:31,220
-I still have question to point 9.
What I found difficult to understand was,

648
01:34:31,320 --> 01:34:38,570
if I am a prover who is not really ill, as we had
it before like different levels and then he does

649
01:34:38,670 --> 01:34:45,820
a proving and he does more than one proving and he changes the symptoms all the time,

650
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:57,020
in the end what is the difference between such
a prover and a patient who takes too many

651
01:34:57,120 --> 01:35:00,430
homeopathic remedies
that don't really fit?

652
01:35:03,050 --> 01:35:08,710
-It's the same. If you are ill, and you take the wrong medicine, you create some symptoms

653
01:35:08,810 --> 01:35:15,460
that we'll talk about now, new symptoms appearing after the remedy,

654
01:35:15,470 --> 01:35:29,540
 a general rule is: if the patient is not
better and you have new symptoms,

655
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:37,740
that means you have given the wrong
remedy and this is a kind of a proving.

656
01:35:40,170 --> 01:35:47,260
 The case is different, in that case, the
patient is getting much better

657
01:35:47,360 --> 01:35:52,060
and you have new symptoms.
That means the remedy was correct

658
01:35:52,160 --> 01:36:00,520
and the new symptoms
indicate the underlying layer.

659
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:26,370
The second case is when the patient is getting better in general and we have new symptoms

660
01:36:26,470 --> 01:36:33,730
that indicate the remedy was
correct and the new symptoms belong

661
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:42,670
 to the next remedy,
to the underlying layer.

662
01:36:44,920 --> 01:36:53,250
But there is another case in
which we have new symptoms

663
01:36:53,350 --> 01:37:04,430
for the patient but if the patient is really getting better and the new symptoms fit exactly

664
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:12,340
with the keynotes of the remedy which
 you gave, that is a confirmation

665
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:20,940
that your remedy was correct, this is
the explanation of this observation.

666
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:25,290
-What exactly is new? Does that mean that
the patient never had these symptoms before

667
01:37:25,390 --> 01:37:30,100
or that they haven't been there when
 you took the history last time

668
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:33,610
but he had had them in his past history?

669
01:37:33,710 --> 01:37:43,160
-They were not there when you took the history.

670
01:37:49,670 --> 01:37:55,140
-Hahnemann talks about the one sided
diseases where they have few symptoms.

671
01:37:55,240 --> 01:37:58,720
 Is this the case number 10?

672
01:37:58,820 --> 01:38:05,920
-All symptoms are observed .....
not this is not the case.

673
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:25,710
-What about the possibility if somebody does
 not get better, he is in the same state,

674
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:30,940
but he develops a clear
picture of a new remedy?

675
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:37,690
For example a Sulphur case, if you give
 Sulphur and it opens the case.

676
01:38:38,390 --> 01:38:48,300
-If this is the case, belongs to the next remedy,
as we said, it belongs to the underlying layer,

677
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:56,900
that means the remedy you gave but you
 say, in case even he is not better

678
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:11,980
but there is a new picture, then if
this new picture is really clear...

679
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:23,060
that means even if your remedy might have
been wrong, it pushed out the correct remedy.

680
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:27,821
So actually you cannot say the remedy is wrong.

681
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:42,370
Old symptoms are observed
to reappear, this is a bad situation.

682
01:39:47,210 --> 01:39:52,900
 I just wanted to see how conscious
 you are when you write down.

683
01:39:53,000 --> 01:40:01,250
When you write down, you have at the same
time to be conscious of what you are writing.

684
01:40:02,090 --> 01:40:13,770
This is a very good sign and it means
that your remedy was correct

685
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:18,070
Provided of course that
there was a reaction.

686
01:40:18,170 --> 01:40:23,850
This happens if there is an initial
aggravation and amelioration

687
01:40:23,950 --> 01:40:31,420
and then all symptoms reappear.
It is a very good reaction.

688
01:40:32,420 --> 01:40:44,470
I go quickly with Kent's observations because
 I want to go through my observations.

689
01:40:46,970 --> 01:40:51,950
-You said that it must be an aggravation
and then amelioration? You wouldn't see

690
01:40:52,050 --> 01:40:57,360
old symptoms reappear without that?
If the potency is right?

691
01:40:57,870 --> 01:41:05,360
-If the person is getting better it's ok
but usually this phenomenon is seen

692
01:41:05,460 --> 01:41:12,340
after a good initial reaction;
it doesn't happen like this.

693
01:41:12,440 --> 01:41:16,180
That a person says, 'oh now
I have old symptoms'.

694
01:41:18,500 --> 01:41:23,050
Symptoms take the wrong direction.

695
01:41:23,150 --> 01:41:32,020
This is a good reaction?
That is a bad reaction.

696
01:41:32,120 --> 01:41:41,720
That means the remedy is similar, is close
but is wrong and the defence mechanism

697
01:41:41,820 --> 01:41:54,470
of the patient is weak, you have to
be careful of these reactions.

698
01:41:56,300 --> 01:42:08,210
It means a weak defence mechanism
of the person and maybe there is

699
01:42:08,310 --> 01:42:21,430
the possibility that the case is incurable.
 Also with the right remedy.

700
01:42:32,780 --> 01:42:38,760
-So George that means that if a person is in
a good state and we give a remedy which

701
01:42:38,860 --> 01:42:45,670
is close to him, you see getting symptoms
going into wrong direction?

702
01:42:45,770 --> 01:42:52,740
-If the organism is strong, even if he
gets it in the wrong direction,

703
01:42:52,840 --> 01:42:57,490
it will be for a very short time and
then it will re-establish order.

704
01:42:57,590 --> 01:43:04,500
But if it stays, it shows that bye, bye.

705
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:12,020
These cases can stay for years,
it doesn't mean that they are going to die,

706
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:20,750
you keep them for years but you never see the initial reaction, you never see the aggravation.

707
01:43:20,850 --> 01:43:26,930
You see amelioration of the symptoms and something else appears which is on a different

708
01:43:27,030 --> 01:43:34,140
level and then you give, and then you
give and more deep, more deep.

709
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:40,140
It is the same thing which
happens with Alzheimer's.

710
01:43:40,240 --> 01:43:45,840
They have a weak defense mechanism,
it goes deeper and deeper and deeper

711
01:43:45,940 --> 01:43:49,650
and then goes into the brain.
Everything goes finally into the brain.

712
01:43:49,750 --> 01:43:56,370
These people don't take homeopathic
medicine but still the process is the same.

713
01:43:56,470 --> 01:44:01,520
The defense mechanism accept
deeper and deeper the problem.

714
01:44:04,300 --> 01:44:11,030
-We said that in this case there is a possibility that it was a similimum but it's an incurable

715
01:44:11,130 --> 01:44:25,240
case and I heard that in cases of 4 group if you give the similimum then there is an amelioration.

716
01:44:27,150 --> 01:44:35,540
-That's the same. That's the situation with
the 4th group. The 4th group will go on like this.

717
01:44:35,640 --> 01:44:42,680
Deeper and deeper and will come back.
It will never bring out a reaction and then

718
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:53,600
 you may keep them for years in a kind of good state, tolerable state but never really cured.
