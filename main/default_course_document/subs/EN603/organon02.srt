1
00:00:21,602 --> 00:00:29,144
I searched for statistics in epilepsy.
I wanted to show you the statistics.

2
00:00:30,966 --> 00:00:36,069
It will be very interesting
to see exactly what happens.

3
00:00:38,142 --> 00:00:47,199
We have a comparison of our
successes and failures...

4
00:00:59,814 --> 00:01:05,102
In the meantime we are
left with some questions.

5
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:21,152
-I have a question about the repetition
of medicines in allopathic drug dependent cases,

6
00:01:21,592 --> 00:01:27,503
 when for example we treat someone
with epilepsy, hypertension and we start

7
00:01:27,815 --> 00:01:34,631
with medicine which we think it's the best and
though we try repeating it, this medicine

8
00:01:34,952 --> 00:01:41,455
is not correct or it is but we
cannot know in the beginning.

9
00:01:41,751 --> 00:01:48,527
But from the point of the start of this
medicine there is aggravation... in which point

10
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:56,159
we have to stop the repeating
until there is aggravation...

11
00:01:58,671 --> 00:02:05,927
If there is an aggravation after starting
the homeopathic remedy. What do you mean?

12
00:02:06,224 --> 00:02:16,888
An aggravation in epilepsy means... In epilepsy
it's not easy to say whether there is

13
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:25,023
an aggravation because you gave the remedy,
unless the person under drugs never

14
00:02:25,192 --> 00:02:32,648
has an attack and then he takes it
and after 2 days there is an attack.

15
00:02:33,816 --> 00:02:39,559
But for the last 5 years he did not
have any attack due to the remedy...

16
00:02:39,975 --> 00:02:52,096
That you can say is an aggravation.
But it's not.

17
00:02:55,536 --> 00:02:58,223
-And in such case we
have to continue...

18
00:02:59,143 --> 00:03:07,959
-If this happens, it means that the
remedy overcame the suppression due

19
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:14,599
to the allopathic drugs and brought
out a reaction of the organism.

20
00:03:14,943 --> 00:03:23,200
That shows a good reaction then you have
to reduce rather the allopathic drug

21
00:03:24,112 --> 00:03:35,048
and continue to give once the epileptic
fit is over. You want to ask something?

22
00:03:36,679 --> 00:03:42,423
-If we have such cases, not epilepsy, for
instance asthmatic cases on cortisone

23
00:03:42,944 --> 00:03:49,479
and we give the medicine and after this
medicine there is an initial aggravation

24
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:55,343
can we continue with repeating the
medicine during the aggravation period or

25
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,904
is it better to stop
the medicine and wait?

26
00:03:58,384 --> 00:04:06,400
-If the asthma is aggravated, that
means you have to stop immediately.

27
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:24,111
That's different. If due to the cortisone
he is taking, there is no aggravation,

28
00:04:24,511 --> 00:04:34,888
no crisis of asthma and you give a remedy
and there is an asthmatic condition,

29
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:42,791
an aggravation, you stop. But
that means the remedy is correct.

30
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,967
The wrong remedy
will do nothing.

31
00:04:46,351 --> 00:04:50,487
Neither in the epilepsy case,
nor in the asthma case.

32
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,040
The wrong remedy
will do nothing.

33
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:07,904
It has not the power to mobilize the defense
mechanism, unless it's very similar

34
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:14,032
to the condition. Then it can mobilize
and manifest the aggravation.

35
00:05:18,687 --> 00:05:27,311
Many times people, even teachers, they
say we have never seen an aggravation.

36
00:05:31,392 --> 00:05:37,671
My question is have they ever seen a cure?
It's doubtful.

37
00:05:39,343 --> 00:05:44,205
The moment that there is an aggravation,
there is a possibility for a cure.

38
00:05:44,917 --> 00:05:48,501
But not in all cases we have aggravation.
It's not possible.

39
00:05:49,605 --> 00:05:55,797
Because not every case is curable. But
if there is aggravation, most probably

40
00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:01,685
there is a cure. Of course sometimes
there is an aggravation without cure.

41
00:06:02,741 --> 00:06:07,901
But this is under certain conditions, not
in the conditions you are talking about.

42
00:06:10,534 --> 00:06:17,989
Ok, I want to show you some facts about
epilepsy. Let me see if you can read.

43
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:41,086
Epilepsy affects over 3 million American
of all ages - more than M.S., C.P., M.D.

44
00:06:41,445 --> 00:06:46,277
and Parkinson's disease combined.
In America epilepsy is as common

45
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:51,038
as breast cancer and
takes as many lives.

46
00:06:54,741 --> 00:06:59,989
Because he had a bad conscience
because one of the patients died.

47
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:07,638
Almost 500 new cases of epilepsy are
diagnosed every day in the U.S.

48
00:07:07,966 --> 00:07:12,325
Epilepsy affects 50.000.000
people worldwide.

49
00:07:12,813 --> 00:07:21,694
One in 100 people will develop epilepsy.
One in 100 of the population of the earth

50
00:07:22,238 --> 00:07:24,678
will develop epilepsy.

51
00:07:26,711 --> 00:07:32,173
1 in 10 people will suffer a
seizure in their lifetime.

52
00:07:36,502 --> 00:07:42,270
This year another 200.000 will be
diagnosed with epilepsy in the U.S.

53
00:07:42,574 --> 00:07:49,693
Each year over 125.000 to 150.000
are newly diagnosed with epilepsy.

54
00:07:50,510 --> 00:08:01,214
30% of those diagnosed are children.
Epilepsy can develop at any age

55
00:08:01,638 --> 00:08:08,245
and can be a result of genetics, stroke,
head injury and many other factors,

56
00:08:08,549 --> 00:08:15,510
of course a side effect
of a brain tumor.

57
00:08:16,076 --> 00:08:24,644
A brain tumor can many times cause
epilepsy. For many soldiers suffering

58
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:31,131
traumatic brain injury on the battlefield,
epilepsy will be a long term consequence.

59
00:08:33,316 --> 00:08:38,004
In 2/3 of patients diagnosed with
epilepsy the cause is unknown.

60
00:08:43,235 --> 00:08:59,012
That's very interesting. As if we
know the workings of the diseases.

61
00:09:00,196 --> 00:09:07,795
The multiplicity of electrochemical
reaction within the body is so complex

62
00:09:08,308 --> 00:09:14,516
that, how can we know. In over 30
percent of patients, seizures cannot be

63
00:09:14,932 --> 00:09:17,275
controlled with treatment.

64
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:23,556
These are the patients that we
receive, they will come to us.

65
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:29,851
I have taken one drug, a second drug, a
third drug and still I can't control,

66
00:09:31,044 --> 00:09:36,779
so could you please help. Such cases
are the ones that come to us.

67
00:09:37,267 --> 00:09:41,875
Uncontrolled seizures may lead
to brain damage and death.

68
00:09:44,332 --> 00:09:52,651
Up to 50.000 Americans die each year
from seizures and related causes.

69
00:09:58,132 --> 00:10:04,324
The mortality rate among people with
epilepsy is 2 to 3 times higher than

70
00:10:04,692 --> 00:10:07,124
the general population.

71
00:10:16,411 --> 00:10:23,275
Risk of sudden death among those
with epilepsy is 24 times greater.

72
00:10:25,508 --> 00:10:34,556
Epilepsy results in an estimated annual cost
of 15.5 billion dollars in medical costs

73
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:40,860
and lost or reduced
earnings and production.

74
00:10:41,244 --> 00:10:47,259
Historically epilepsy research
has been under funded.

75
00:10:52,644 --> 00:11:03,148
Each year NIH spends 30 billion dollars of
medical research ,30 billion is not enough

76
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:05,523
to find the cause of epilepsy.

77
00:11:05,971 --> 00:11:11,499
If it was 50 billion, they would find
it and epilepsy would disappear.

78
00:11:11,868 --> 00:11:16,100
These are unbelievable facts.

79
00:11:25,972 --> 00:11:39,300
Just half or 1 percent is spent
on epilepsy. I was too excited.

80
00:11:42,323 --> 00:11:46,963
The federal government spends much
less on epilepsy research compared

81
00:11:47,308 --> 00:11:59,252
to other diseases, many of which affect
fewer people. That is quite interesting.

82
00:12:00,275 --> 00:12:19,939
The overall picture of epilepsy is interesting
but if we want to see the history

83
00:12:20,276 --> 00:12:27,764
of epilepsy, maybe we will see that even
in very old times the epileptics were

84
00:12:28,108 --> 00:12:42,052
quite substantial number. There are
reasons for multiplying these cases

85
00:12:44,684 --> 00:13:11,444
but I believe that this is a disease
...considered as the divine disease

86
00:13:12,068 --> 00:13:13,204
or something like that.

87
00:13:14,372 --> 00:13:24,803
You know Dostoyevsky, one of the greatest
writers, he was suffering from epilepsy

88
00:13:27,187 --> 00:13:47,227
and they say a lot of epileptics before
the real convulsion starts, they perceive

89
00:13:47,524 --> 00:13:53,868
a state of a divine awareness.

90
00:13:59,491 --> 00:14:04,795
Which for this reason I was thinking
that epilepsy is connected somewhat

91
00:14:05,796 --> 00:14:14,172
with the effort of humans
to approach the divine.

92
00:14:20,163 --> 00:14:35,643
I have too progressive ideas but ... in the
effort of people to be aware of the divine

93
00:14:37,883 --> 00:14:52,907
there is an electric charge which is
generated, which ends up into convulsions and

94
00:14:53,268 --> 00:15:02,764
before the convulsions a
sense of divine awareness.

95
00:15:12,795 --> 00:15:21,612
I don't know what more to say because I
didn't have so far an epileptic fit so ...

96
00:15:22,124 --> 00:15:25,995
if I continue I don't know
what is going to happen.

97
00:15:37,324 --> 00:15:40,604
I spoke about 94? No?

98
00:15:42,268 --> 00:15:50,371
"While inquiring into the state of chronic
disease, the particular circumstances

99
00:15:50,693 --> 00:15:58,541
of the patient with regard to his ordinary
occupations, his usual mode of living

100
00:15:58,836 --> 00:16:05,635
and diet, his domestic situation and
so forth, must be well considered

101
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:14,411
and scrutinized" you have to examine
why this man/woman has these problems,

102
00:16:15,276 --> 00:16:24,405
does anything happen that is abnormal?
Do you eat badly food?

103
00:16:24,812 --> 00:16:35,013
Are you accustomed in bad habits? "to
ascertain what there is in them that

104
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:42,713
may tend to produce or to maintain
disease" he says you have to find out

105
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:49,825
" in order that by their removal
the recovery may be promoted".

106
00:16:50,571 --> 00:16:59,256
You have to examine whether there
are some things he is doing

107
00:16:59,775 --> 00:17:09,569
or he has circumstances around him which promote
and aggravates his situation.

108
00:17:09,937 --> 00:17:12,953
So you have to advise
him not to do that.

109
00:17:18,953 --> 00:17:25,144
"In chronic diseases of females it is
especially necessary to pay attention

110
00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:38,617
to pregnancy" if somebody is pregnant
and she has nausea it is because

111
00:17:39,001 --> 00:17:45,489
she is pregnant and don't
detach it from pregnancy...

112
00:17:50,129 --> 00:17:56,256
"sterility, sexual
desire, accouchements"

113
00:17:57,153 --> 00:18:12,177
Accouchements is talking about
sexual desire in a nice way.

114
00:18:25,001 --> 00:18:33,857
Let's be practical, I started with one word
I said I don't know the word but finally

115
00:18:34,377 --> 00:18:44,442
the meaning is, the sexual desire by
itself cannot be a kind of symptomatology.

116
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:54,520
What you do with sexual desire can
be a cause for symptomatology.

117
00:18:55,657 --> 00:19:02,289
If you have to masturbate 3 times,
a day it is a kind of impediment.

118
00:19:02,865 --> 00:19:13,529
And indulging in sexual desire can cause
symptoms. Then the doctor has to advise

119
00:19:14,081 --> 00:19:21,945
the person, please stop it, don't
do it so frequently at least.

120
00:19:25,225 --> 00:19:31,633
That is the practical thing of this,
otherwise there is no meaning.

121
00:19:35,881 --> 00:19:48,889
Miscarriage, carrying baby ... I saw
by chance in Discovery a film,

122
00:19:50,945 --> 00:19:59,560
before I go to sleep, I put science Discovery,
because the News in Greek are useless,

123
00:20:03,945 --> 00:20:13,178
a women went with her husband in a
boat and found themselves in a storm,

124
00:20:13,464 --> 00:20:21,504
they found themselves in a place to get
out of the storm, and suddenly the woman

125
00:20:21,841 --> 00:20:29,730
started having tremendous pains in the
uterus, in the lower abdomen and suddenly

126
00:20:30,297 --> 00:20:36,432
within the storm the woman started having
blood running out of her uterus and

127
00:20:36,825 --> 00:20:38,089
she was screaming.

128
00:20:38,473 --> 00:20:46,857
The husband was sleeping so heavily that
she could not wake him up by crying.

129
00:20:47,361 --> 00:20:57,585
She was on the deck and he was sleeping
down. She was screaming ,something

130
00:20:57,977 --> 00:21:07,530
is coming out the uterus... the husband
wakes up finally and sees something comes

131
00:21:07,889 --> 00:21:17,706
out, an inner organ of the woman is
coming out. They called the ambulance.

132
00:21:18,401 --> 00:21:27,824
The ambulance comes with a gynecologist
and support, they move her.

133
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:53,393
She tries to go to the bed and you
see the gynecologist and the midwife

134
00:21:55,521 --> 00:22:04,145
were like this!!! There was a baby coming
out. She did not know she was pregnant.

135
00:22:06,673 --> 00:22:16,977
I couldn't believe the story. In Discovery
they don't tell nonsense, they tell

136
00:22:17,376 --> 00:22:30,489
very interesting stories but the woman did
not know that she was pregnant actually.

137
00:22:31,105 --> 00:22:40,497
Otherwise she could imagine... something is
coming out, an inner organ is coming out.

138
00:22:43,265 --> 00:22:49,201
I told you about a woman who had come
and I asked her how old are you?

139
00:22:51,048 --> 00:23:01,017
She said allow me not to tell you, I said Ok,
I looked at her and I wrote in my notes 27.

140
00:23:04,729 --> 00:23:09,593
Then she tells me the symptoms
and something is wrong.

141
00:23:11,969 --> 00:23:22,434
I give the remedy, she comes the next time.
She says you asked me how old I am

142
00:23:24,401 --> 00:23:26,129
so I told you a lie.

143
00:23:27,553 --> 00:23:39,530
I said how old are you and she said 45.
She was on menopause.

144
00:23:52,417 --> 00:24:01,241
Hahnemann being so detailed with everything,
he relates all the possibilities here

145
00:24:01,728 --> 00:24:03,432
that you can go through.

146
00:24:11,705 --> 00:24:21,009
"In chronic disease the investigation of
the signs of disease above mentioned,

147
00:24:21,929 --> 00:24:31,082
and of all others, must be pursued as
carefully and circumstantially as possible,

148
00:24:31,601 --> 00:24:41,504
and the most minute peculiarities must
be attended to, partly because in these

149
00:24:41,835 --> 00:24:50,609
diseases they are the most characteristic
and least resemble those of acute diseases.

150
00:24:51,161 --> 00:24:56,992
And if a cure is to be affected,
they cannot be too accurately noted;

151
00:24:57,666 --> 00:25:03,697
partly because the patients become so used
to their long sufferings that they pay

152
00:25:04,121 --> 00:25:08,497
little or no heed to the
lesser accessory symptoms"

153
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:18,776
We spoke about acute diseases before
and we said that in acute diseases

154
00:25:20,033 --> 00:25:26,921
you do not need to take a full case
because the changes are so obvious that

155
00:25:27,273 --> 00:25:31,968
the patient will give them
spontaneously to you.

156
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:46,361
But he says in chronic diseases you
have to be much more careful because

157
00:25:48,513 --> 00:25:59,506
the patient except of his main pathological
condition, he may not pay attention

158
00:26:00,233 --> 00:26:09,761
to the little minute details that are so
important for prescribing a homeopathic remedy.

159
00:26:15,433 --> 00:26:20,944
"...partly because the patients become
so used to their long sufferings that

160
00:26:21,241 --> 00:26:26,241
they pay little or no heed to the lesser
accessory symptoms, which are often very

161
00:26:26,633 --> 00:26:34,384
pregnant with meaning (characteristic) [...]
and regard them almost as a necessary

162
00:26:34,713 --> 00:26:36,281
part of their condition".

163
00:26:36,969 --> 00:26:41,882
That means they have been used so
many years to be having a symptom

164
00:26:42,313 --> 00:26:53,729
that they do not consider it anymore as
a symptom. For instance a woman where

165
00:26:54,009 --> 00:27:00,378
she may have interrupted menses, all her
life she has 2 days, one day stops and

166
00:27:01,018 --> 00:27:08,201
she is used to that. She comes now for chronic
headaches, she will not tell you that

167
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:13,737
I have an interruption of 1 day in my
menses, because she is used to that.

168
00:27:14,209 --> 00:27:28,257
Another man has a nose that if he takes
onions, it will be terrible for him.

169
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:32,641
So he gives them up and for
20 years he never ate onions.

170
00:27:33,145 --> 00:27:42,441
He will not come and tell you I don't eat
onions unless you ask him and that's why

171
00:27:42,816 --> 00:27:49,936
he says be careful now on chronic conditions
because the symptoms which are going

172
00:27:50,249 --> 00:27:55,337
to be given to you spontaneously, are
not going to be the symptoms we are

173
00:27:55,657 --> 00:27:58,017
interested in.

174
00:27:59,216 --> 00:28:07,216
We are interested in little details that
may be the person has been used to them

175
00:28:07,545 --> 00:28:14,913
and consider as part of his
own self, not of his disease.

176
00:28:18,544 --> 00:28:24,528
"...and regard them almost as a necessary
part of their condition, almost as health"

177
00:28:29,505 --> 00:28:42,153
If I take this food, I will be having
heartburns so I never take it.

178
00:28:42,616 --> 00:28:50,184
"...the real feeling of which they have
well-night forgotten in the sometimes fifteen

179
00:28:50,505 --> 00:28:59,545
or twenty years of suffering" after 20 years
he never uses onion, he has forgotten

180
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:00,888
about it.

181
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:09,472
"and they can scarcely bring themselves
to believe that these accessory symptoms,

182
00:29:18,144 --> 00:29:25,976
these greater or less deviations from the
healthy state, can have any connection

183
00:29:26,416 --> 00:29:34,809
with their principal malady." They will not
mention it to you and that's why you have

184
00:29:35,152 --> 00:29:44,992
to investigate and go back and ask the
different departments of health and find out

185
00:29:45,632 --> 00:29:53,456
the little deviations. We base
our prescription on keynotes.

186
00:29:55,205 --> 00:30:01,165
He is bringing up this idea of keynotes
on which we have to prescribe but these

187
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:07,764
keynotes sometimes are
ignored by the patient.

188
00:30:08,188 --> 00:30:23,677
The patient says I have a swollen leg, a
swollen knee... whether I eat onions or not

189
00:30:24,276 --> 00:30:27,980
has nothing to do
with my swollen knee.

190
00:30:31,477 --> 00:30:40,974
So if the right knee is swollen and the
person does not like onions or is worse

191
00:30:41,308 --> 00:30:47,452
from onion, the remedy
is... Lycopodium.

192
00:30:49,365 --> 00:30:55,797
You cannot go so far but almost. But
you can see how important it is.

193
00:30:59,964 --> 00:31:08,797
"Besides this, patients themselves differ
so much in their dispositions, that some,

194
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:17,044
especially the so-called hypochondriacs
and other persons of great sensitiveness

195
00:31:18,684 --> 00:31:25,676
and impatient of suffering, portray their
symptoms in too vivid colors and in order

196
00:31:26,061 --> 00:31:32,357
to induce the physician to give them relief,
describe their ailments in exaggerated

197
00:31:33,212 --> 00:31:46,933
expression." Once I had
a case of an American.

198
00:31:47,845 --> 00:32:07,058
I've never seen such an expression of
symptoms in such a vivid way as he was able

199
00:32:07,434 --> 00:32:13,410
to express them to me. It was an enjoyment.
I was just listening to him.

200
00:32:14,074 --> 00:32:31,498
How he suffered and cannot work and the
fears, I hate my mother and if I go to

201
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:40,625
the street I fight... It was
an explosion of symptoms.

202
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:45,690
I was just listening, I had
no chance to put a question.

203
00:32:53,257 --> 00:33:03,770
I said have you taken remedies? He said yes
this and that. Did you take Stramonium?

204
00:33:04,994 --> 00:33:15,130
He said no. Ok, take Stramonium now. For
1 hour he was relating symptoms in that

205
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:24,011
vivacity that I said to myself, if I had one
tenth of his energy, I would have changed

206
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:35,226
the world. What energy
was that, fantastic!

207
00:33:39,482 --> 00:33:52,098
And Hahnemann makes a note, he says
the hypochondriac may exaggerate

208
00:33:52,370 --> 00:34:03,027
their symptoms but actually they have the
symptoms and you can test it by giving

209
00:34:03,434 --> 00:34:09,314
them placebo and
observe under it.

210
00:34:10,019 --> 00:34:21,675
They will still continue to have the symptoms.
But out of all the symptoms they relate

211
00:34:22,098 --> 00:34:30,875
what you have to take as definite is
the exaggerated way that they relate

212
00:34:31,443 --> 00:34:37,354
the symptoms to you. Very
vivid, exaggerated way.

213
00:34:39,402 --> 00:34:53,490
Which are mostly patients with a
psychological problem and usually the people

214
00:34:53,786 --> 00:35:02,387
who are manic depressive during the
period of mania they will describe

215
00:35:02,643 --> 00:35:05,075
their symptoms in this way.

216
00:35:11,426 --> 00:35:19,538
"Other individuals of an opposite
character, however, partly from indolence,

217
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:48,522
partly from false modesty, partly from a
kind of mildness of disposition or weakness

218
00:35:48,842 --> 00:35:54,715
of mind, refrain from mentioning a
number of their symptoms, describe them

219
00:35:54,948 --> 00:36:01,226
in vague terms, or allege some of
them to be of no consequence."

220
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:09,322
They think why should I bother the
doctor with this and that which I have?

221
00:36:10,147 --> 00:36:16,804
You have to realize that this is the type
of person and you have to encourage him

222
00:36:17,531 --> 00:36:23,178
to talk and to tell yes I'm
interested and then they start.

223
00:36:23,666 --> 00:36:31,770
Once you give them the space, you
are listening, they will talk.

224
00:37:02,083 --> 00:37:07,371
Listen to this paragraph 98.
Very important paragraph.

225
00:37:09,459 --> 00:37:20,187
"Now, as certainly as we should listen
particularly to the patient's description

226
00:37:20,811 --> 00:37:32,075
of his sufferings and sensations, and attach
credence especially to his own expressions

227
00:37:37,011 --> 00:37:47,795
wherewith he endeavors to make
us understand his pathology [...]

228
00:38:01,042 --> 00:38:11,338
so certainly, on the other hand, in all
diseases, but especially in the chronic ones,

229
00:38:11,906 --> 00:38:34,986
the investigation of the true, complete picture
and its peculiarities demands especial

230
00:38:36,242 --> 00:38:57,233
circumspection, tact, knowledge of human
nature, caution in conducting the inquiry

231
00:38:58,329 --> 00:39:03,145
and patience in an
eminent degree."

232
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:13,137
You have to be patient to be looking,
hearing him but at the same time you are

233
00:39:13,529 --> 00:39:21,329
putting questions with tact and
understand the human nature.

234
00:39:22,266 --> 00:39:29,530
Because the moment that you have a
patient and you start criticizing him

235
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:37,377
'he is so selfish, he talks about himself,
he thinks only himself, he is jealous'...

236
00:39:43,762 --> 00:39:54,641
some of my students have done this. Wait
a moment. He's your patient you have

237
00:39:55,018 --> 00:40:05,075
to look, observe, try to get all the
information but never be critical.

238
00:40:05,474 --> 00:40:15,682
Understand human nature which means
that whatever deviations a human being

239
00:40:16,042 --> 00:40:28,954
may have, it is understandable by the
doctor who has the ability to understand

240
00:40:29,298 --> 00:40:39,427
human beings. It's not his
fault that he is jealous.

241
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:46,266
Jealousy is a symptom once
it is becoming excessive.

242
00:40:48,058 --> 00:40:53,034
He's not in control of that, so you
cannot criticize him for having this.

243
00:40:53,594 --> 00:41:03,866
A person who is oversexed and he needs to
go to prostitutes, a person who is born

244
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:18,106
with some problems in the hormonal area, is
not under his control, you cannot judge.

245
00:41:19,339 --> 00:41:29,003
Sometimes I have spoken about those born
homosexual. It is like being born with

246
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:38,377
a predisposition for which
they have no control at all.

247
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:48,418
Therefore understanding the human nature
without judging them and listening

248
00:41:49,274 --> 00:42:02,730
with special circumspection, the word means
all-around understanding

249
00:42:09,675 --> 00:42:19,771
and patience in an eminent degree. 
This is the most difficult I can tell you.

250
00:42:20,786 --> 00:42:32,330
The moment that you have programmed to
see 20 cases, you cannot have patience,

251
00:42:32,738 --> 00:42:38,322
I can tell you. 20 cases a day
for a homeopath is impossible.

252
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:45,162
So you are going to speed up the process
and you are going to make mistakes.

253
00:42:48,715 --> 00:42:59,690
I remember when I was in Calcutta Homeopathic
College, an old student of Kent,

254
00:43:03,947 --> 00:43:10,562
he was a teacher in the college and
people were coming to the outpatient

255
00:43:10,986 --> 00:43:21,323
department, there was a big line of patients
and he was there with his big glasses,

256
00:43:22,003 --> 00:43:30,202
he looks and writes, then the next...
He doesn't ask any questions.

257
00:43:31,042 --> 00:43:40,539
He looked and asked 1 or 2 questions and he
gives a prescription and all the students

258
00:43:41,331 --> 00:43:47,850
were behind looking what he was doing.
I could not understand at all.

259
00:43:48,858 --> 00:43:57,525
The Indians were used to this.
So I asked somebody to explain.

260
00:44:01,156 --> 00:44:15,708
So he saw me, that I was also interested and then there was a
little baby, looks, writes and as I tried to

261
00:44:16,116 --> 00:44:26,821
look he closes, so I could not see
the prescription, what did I give.

262
00:44:28,709 --> 00:44:37,917
I look at the baby and the saliva was
running out, most probably Mercury I said.

263
00:44:40,028 --> 00:44:46,572
He did not say anything. He was unhappy.
He gave Mercury of course.

264
00:44:47,237 --> 00:44:55,340
But this kind of Homeopathy is a necessary
situation in a country where there is no

265
00:44:55,700 --> 00:45:07,173
money, no medicines, not enough doctors
etc. But Hahnemann is German, not Indian.

266
00:45:08,213 --> 00:45:16,428
So he wants the
absolute and the most...

267
00:45:24,277 --> 00:45:32,964
Paragraph 99. "On the whole, the investigation
of acute diseases, or of such as have

268
00:45:33,252 --> 00:45:40,020
existed but a short time, is much the
easiest for the physician, because all

269
00:45:40,413 --> 00:45:47,485
the phenomena and deviations from the
health that has been put recently lost

270
00:45:47,764 --> 00:45:51,284
are still fresh in the memory of
the patient and his friends..."

271
00:45:52,237 --> 00:46:01,165
In acute cases the patient knows how he
was feeling before and how he feels now.

272
00:46:04,388 --> 00:46:14,797
So he is freshing his memory.. and his
friends. Here is very important that Hahnemann

273
00:46:16,053 --> 00:46:26,365
based a lot of his decisions upon the
information from people around the patient.

274
00:46:26,797 --> 00:46:34,125
Because these people who have lived around
somebody, know quite a lot of the habits,

275
00:46:34,701 --> 00:46:44,525
their way of behaving etc. "...still
continue to be novel and striking.

276
00:46:48,821 --> 00:46:55,460
The physician certainly requires to
know everything in such cases also;

277
00:46:55,868 --> 00:47:10,021
but he has much less to inquire into..." In
acute conditions the homeopath does not

278
00:47:10,477 --> 00:47:15,652
have to ask many questions. I have said
many times that you go to a person with

279
00:47:19,149 --> 00:47:33,533
meningitis and there is severe pain,
there is high fever and you do not ask

280
00:47:33,844 --> 00:47:46,500
'do you like sweets?'. You investigate
and you take the present symptoms

281
00:47:48,612 --> 00:47:55,404
which are much less that
in chronic conditions.

282
00:48:03,804 --> 00:48:09,540
"...they are for the most part
spontaneously detailed to him."

283
00:48:18,693 --> 00:48:27,869
Paragraph 100. "In investigating the
totality of the symptoms of epidemic and

284
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:35,053
sporadic diseases it is quite immaterial
whether or not something similar has ever

285
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:42,732
appeared in the world before, under
the same or any other name."

286
00:48:55,735 --> 00:49:07,903
Before we discussed here the new type of
influenza that has spread all over the world

287
00:49:09,143 --> 00:49:15,775
and I related the symptoms of influenza
this time which are totally different than

288
00:49:16,127 --> 00:49:20,998
the symptoms of usual
influenzas of the past years.

289
00:49:22,342 --> 00:49:32,095
He says be careful these diseases you must
not think oh it's an influenza take this

290
00:49:32,439 --> 00:49:39,454
or that remedy. It may be a
totally new kind of picture.

291
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:48,927
"...The novelty or peculiarity of a disease
of that kind makes no difference either in

292
00:49:49,303 --> 00:49:56,766
the mode of examining or of treating it,
as the physician must any way regard

293
00:49:57,094 --> 00:50:03,182
the pure picture of every prevailing
disease, as if it were something new and

294
00:50:03,479 --> 00:50:09,342
unknown, and investigate it thoroughly for
itself, if he desires to practice medicine

295
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:20,991
in a real and radical manner. Never
substituting conjecture for actual observation"

296
00:50:22,687 --> 00:50:29,159
If you want to practice real medicine, you
don't have to say oh yes I know this is

297
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:39,975
an epidemic of enterocolitis,
therefore take Arsenicum album.

298
00:50:42,087 --> 00:50:57,839
He says at any given time in history an
acute disease may come with a new profile

299
00:50:58,463 --> 00:51:00,023
of symptoms.

300
00:51:12,631 --> 00:51:23,023
"...always carefully examining it in all its
phases; and this mode of procedure is all

301
00:51:23,342 --> 00:51:29,662
the more requisite in such cases, as a
careful examination will show that every

302
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:36,879
prevailing disease is in many respects
a phenomenon of a unique character,

303
00:51:37,367 --> 00:51:45,262
differing vastly from all previous epidemics,
to which certain names have been falsely

304
00:51:45,695 --> 00:51:54,287
applied - with the exception of those epidemics
resulting from a contagious principle

305
00:51:54,598 --> 00:52:01,030
that always remains the same,
such as smallpox, measles, etc."

306
00:52:04,615 --> 00:52:15,631
By saying that he is like a prophet. He
says that certain contagious diseases

307
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:28,551
coming from a specific microbe may
remain in their overall picture steady.

308
00:52:29,847 --> 00:52:38,711
But other acute conditions may
come every time in a changed form.

309
00:52:39,207 --> 00:52:48,480
Every time you have to look a new case
like a common cold, bronchitis, influenza,

310
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:58,568
you have to look whether this type of
acute is different from the previous one

311
00:52:59,448 --> 00:53:04,039
and do not immediately come to the
conclusion I know what it is.

312
00:53:11,328 --> 00:53:18,673
Paragraph 101, "It may easily happen that
in the first case of an epidemic disease

313
00:53:19,312 --> 00:53:24,632
that presents itself to the physician's
notice he does not at once obtain a knowledge

314
00:53:24,904 --> 00:53:32,016
of its complete picture, as it is only by a
close observation of several cases of every

315
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:37,783
such collective disease that he can become
conversant with the totality of its signs

316
00:53:38,056 --> 00:53:39,248
and symptoms."

317
00:53:40,072 --> 00:53:47,952
He says in these influenza epidemics
don't come into conclusion immediately,

318
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:54,927
you have to see a lot of cases to understand
the overall picture of the epidemic.

319
00:53:57,169 --> 00:54:05,808
"...The carefully observing physician can,
however, from the examination of even

320
00:54:06,136 --> 00:54:15,072
the first and second patients, often arrive
so nearly at thr knowledge of the true state

321
00:54:15,568 --> 00:54:23,286
as to have in his mind a characteristic
portrait of it, and even to succeed in finding

322
00:54:23,726 --> 00:54:28,814
a suitable, homeopathically
adapted remedy for it."

323
00:54:29,246 --> 00:54:36,893
That means the carefully observing physician,
he will see 1-2 cases, immediately

324
00:54:37,278 --> 00:54:46,774
he gets a good picture of the
epidemic but it's not always so.

325
00:54:47,246 --> 00:54:51,878
"In the course of writing down the
symptoms of several cases of this kind

326
00:54:53,591 --> 00:54:59,510
the sketch of the disease picture becomes
ever more and more complete, not more

327
00:54:59,871 --> 00:55:07,670
spun out and verbose, but more
significant [...] become precisely defined

328
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:10,134
as to their peculiarities..."

329
00:55:11,542 --> 00:55:16,630
If you write down the symptoms in each case
that you take, eventually you will have

330
00:55:16,958 --> 00:55:25,510
a whole picture, not fantasy, but
real picture of the epidemic.

331
00:55:26,238 --> 00:55:35,806
"...and on the other, the more marked and
special symptoms which are peculiar to

332
00:55:36,678 --> 00:55:43,614
but few diseases and of rarer occurrence,
at least in the same combination, become

333
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:49,653
prominent and constitute what is
characteristic of this malady...",

334
00:55:51,686 --> 00:55:56,462
"The physician who has already, in the
first cases, been able to choose a remedy

335
00:55:56,742 --> 00:56:04,045
approximating to the homoeopathic specific,
will, from the subsequence cases,

336
00:56:04,751 --> 00:56:11,470
be enabled either to verify the suitableness
of the medicine chosen, or to discover

337
00:56:11,822 --> 00:56:15,910
a more appropriate, the most
appropriate homoeopathic remedy."

338
00:56:16,438 --> 00:56:23,925
That means he has seen one or two
cases, he has prescribed some remedies

339
00:56:24,294 --> 00:56:32,070
but as he writes down carefully all the
symptoms of each case, he eventually may find

340
00:56:32,414 --> 00:56:44,198
out yes I was correct prescribing these
remedies or may find out the real genius of

341
00:56:44,534 --> 00:56:52,910
the epidemic is not what I thought it was;
Eupatorium perfoliatum but it is Rhus tox.

342
00:56:53,886 --> 00:57:03,366
He may find out that he was not correct
and he prescribed Eupatorium perfoliatum

343
00:57:03,742 --> 00:57:06,246
whether he should have
prescribed Rhus tox.

344
00:57:06,606 --> 00:57:12,349
Why? Because he has seen a lot of
cases of Rhus tox symptomatology.

345
00:57:14,918 --> 00:57:23,991
This case that I prescribed a similar
remedy or kind of correct remedy was not to

346
00:57:24,278 --> 00:57:29,894
the point and I should have prescribed
another one, more appropriate.

347
00:57:41,326 --> 00:57:50,110
Homeopathy is a real science
but it's a difficult one.

348
00:57:58,094 --> 00:58:08,102
That is a fact but at the same time those who
learn it, I can assure you they can have

349
00:58:08,718 --> 00:58:12,391
whatever they like in life.

350
00:58:19,062 --> 00:58:27,069
I have 3 electric cars. 2 of
them have been given as present!

351
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:38,742
Apart from anything else which I wanted
it has been given by divine grace or

352
00:58:39,078 --> 00:58:59,853
whatever... Not that I want crazy things
but what I feel is that this knowledge

353
00:59:01,206 --> 00:59:11,847
has given me a satisfaction which if I did
not have it most probably I would have gone

354
00:59:12,334 --> 00:59:21,349
to the next stage, as the Indians say, to
the next cycle of reincarnation, very early

355
00:59:21,798 --> 00:59:31,326
in my life. I have programmed it already
quite early because I was suffering so much,

356
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:37,773
I said you suffer another 10 years, I
was 15 when I started with the pains.

357
00:59:42,881 --> 00:59:50,712
10-12 years I came in contact with
Homeopathy. I owe all my life to Homeopathy.

358
01:00:02,745 --> 01:00:12,098
I read this honestly one time in my life in
1960. Never again I opened it this book.

359
01:00:19,163 --> 01:00:29,227
I read it right through but it is as if it
has remained every meaning of the book and

360
01:00:29,578 --> 01:00:39,858
became my practice. You don't
believe that I never read this.

361
01:00:40,458 --> 01:00:47,130
Maybe some things I overcame because
I thought they were not important.

362
01:00:49,067 --> 01:00:55,595
This is the second time I'm reading it and I
said if I read it for a second time I may

363
01:00:56,770 --> 01:01:07,803
record my comments, so they may
stay for the next generation.

364
01:01:15,706 --> 01:01:21,674
For me it was the most pleasant and
easiest book I have ever read in my life.

365
01:01:23,626 --> 01:01:28,226
That is also true. I was
so excited by that time.

366
01:01:30,098 --> 01:01:41,011
Now I am reading again and I'm again
excited. After 53 years... it is ridiculous.

367
01:01:44,771 --> 01:01:49,378
-Maybe in your next life you
won't need to read it anymore.

368
01:01:50,572 --> 01:01:59,396
-I hope. But now I read it for your sake.
The first time I read it for my sake...

369
01:02:02,947 --> 01:02:06,059
So whoever is present...

370
01:02:10,611 --> 01:02:16,931
-When I started practicing Homeopathy with
your teachings, I used to find problems

371
01:02:17,459 --> 01:02:24,586
in practice and in my town there is
nobody to whom I can ask questions.

372
01:02:25,147 --> 01:02:30,099
I have a problem, please help me sir.
So I started reading this book.

373
01:02:32,275 --> 01:02:39,347
From then till I came here. I
have completed Organon 232 times...

374
01:02:40,627 --> 01:02:42,714
-You read Organon!

375
01:02:43,179 --> 01:02:46,915
-Yes, back to back,
page to page.

376
01:02:47,355 --> 01:02:54,227
-I believe you! The energy that you
present, that you have is unbelievable.

377
01:02:54,747 --> 01:03:02,635
-Last year when I came here you have given
me a sign. At that time I had completed

378
01:03:02,979 --> 01:03:17,166
Organon 150 times. And I believe this is
the best book I have ever read in my life.

379
01:03:17,437 --> 01:03:21,598
-I can see you have read it. The
condition of the book is terrible.

380
01:03:25,245 --> 01:03:28,941
You have been studying
it very thoroughly.

381
01:03:35,213 --> 01:03:50,365
So I want to continue. Are you tired? I
can tell you stories, if you are tired.

382
01:03:57,133 --> 01:04:09,717
The German people, they told me it's so
difficult reading this book. Is it true?

383
01:04:11,213 --> 01:04:18,029
I said yes, it's very difficult to read
the Organon in the original German.

384
01:04:19,637 --> 01:04:29,085
Hahnemann does not want to leave anything
out, so in one phrase which is very long,

385
01:04:29,605 --> 01:04:37,477
he says everything but in order to follow
his thought you have to be himself.

386
01:04:38,949 --> 01:04:43,964
Only himself could understand
what he was writing...

387
01:05:02,789 --> 01:05:09,781
"...but the whole extent of such an epidemic
disease and the totality of its symptoms

388
01:05:11,277 --> 01:05:19,892
cannot be learned from one single patient,
but is only to be perfectly deduced and

389
01:05:20,261 --> 01:05:26,909
ascertained from the sufferings of several
patients of different constitutions."

390
01:05:31,357 --> 01:05:46,045
He understands that an epidemic is not
engrafting a symptomatology which is typical

391
01:05:46,350 --> 01:05:55,269
in every patient but every organism
reacts to this epidemic according

392
01:05:55,854 --> 01:05:58,630
to its possibilities.

393
01:05:59,869 --> 01:06:14,334
An organism has good possibilities, reacts
good, raising high fever and within a few

394
01:06:15,190 --> 01:06:22,189
days it's gone, the other one cannot
raise a high fever and goes on and on.

395
01:06:23,941 --> 01:06:32,454
Each patient reacts according to his
own individuality and constitution.

396
01:06:44,926 --> 01:06:59,526
Par. 103, "In the same manner as has here
been taught relative to the epidemic

397
01:06:59,925 --> 01:07:06,445
diseases, which are generally of an acute
character, the miasmatic chronic maladies,

398
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:14,109
which, as I have shown, always remain the
same in their essential nature, especially

399
01:07:14,573 --> 01:07:21,517
the psora, must be investigated, as to
the whole sphere of their symptoms,

400
01:07:22,142 --> 01:07:30,493
in a much more minute manner than has
ever been done before, for in them also

401
01:07:30,886 --> 01:07:36,101
one patient only exhibits a
portion of their symptoms,

402
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:47,565
a second, a third, and so on, present
some other symptoms, which also are but

403
01:07:48,165 --> 01:07:53,350
a portion of the totality of the symptoms
which constitute the entire extent

404
01:07:53,709 --> 01:07:58,533
of this malady, so that the whole array
of the symptoms belonging to such

405
01:07:58,982 --> 01:08:04,157
a miasmatic, chronic disease, and especially
to the psora, can only be ascertained

406
01:08:04,485 --> 01:08:13,438
from the observation of very many single
patients affected with such a chronic disease,

407
01:08:16,006 --> 01:08:21,661
and without a complete survey and
collective picture of these symptoms

408
01:08:22,141 --> 01:08:27,005
the medicines capable of curing the
whole malady homeopathically cannot be

409
01:08:27,429 --> 01:08:29,237
discovered..."

410
01:08:36,861 --> 01:08:44,421
What he says is that, well I told you about
the epidemics, you have to see a lot of

411
01:08:44,797 --> 01:08:54,701
patients before you understand the extent
of the epidemic and you form an idea of

412
01:08:55,061 --> 01:08:58,581
what is the symptomatology
of the epidemic.

413
01:08:59,685 --> 01:09:06,757
With psora, when it comes to the miasmatic
conditions, in chronic conditions,

414
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:15,549
you have a bigger problem before you
understand the whole extent of the effect

415
01:09:15,965 --> 01:09:30,693
of psora, suppressed scabies... who
does not understand "scabies"?

416
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:42,630
Everybody understands. So to understand
he says the extent of the miasm psora,

417
01:09:44,134 --> 01:09:53,566
you have to see a lot of patients and
eventually you understand the whole damage

418
01:09:54,797 --> 01:10:00,269
that suppression of scabies
can have upon the human race.

419
01:10:02,326 --> 01:10:08,565
Because one patient presents one part,
another patient presents another part and

420
01:10:08,933 --> 01:10:19,686
then you have to put them all together to
find out the whole extent of the damage

421
01:10:20,078 --> 01:10:26,181
that a miasm psora, has
done on the human race.

422
01:10:28,245 --> 01:10:31,845
Who was in the previous?

423
01:10:39,813 --> 01:10:49,621
Previously we had some cases that they
had the same causative factor but

424
01:10:50,038 --> 01:10:53,310
they reacted in a
totally different way.

425
01:10:55,822 --> 01:11:05,421
One came as symptoms of Anagallis, the
other came as Staphysagria symptoms and

426
01:11:05,701 --> 01:11:08,509
the other came with symptoms
of Natrum muriaticum.

427
01:11:09,806 --> 01:11:18,549
In the same way with the psora suppressed
each organism brings out different type

428
01:11:19,173 --> 01:11:26,814
of symptomatology and you have to put all
this in order to understand the psora miasm.

429
01:11:30,694 --> 01:11:37,006
So he is developing
the idea of the miasms.

430
01:11:55,574 --> 01:12:03,341
"...without a complete survey and collective
picture of these symptoms the medicines

431
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:13,903
capable of curing the whole malady
homeopathically cannot be discovered".

432
01:12:14,301 --> 01:12:22,166
That means if you don't have the whole picture,
you will not be able to find the correct

433
01:12:22,534 --> 01:12:28,422
remedy. "...and these medicines are, at the
same time, the true remedies of the several

434
01:12:28,798 --> 01:12:32,309
patients suffering from
such chronic affections."

435
01:12:35,405 --> 01:12:44,865
Par. 104, "When the totality of the symptoms
that specially mark and distinguish

436
01:12:45,298 --> 01:12:52,314
the case of disease or, in other words, when
the picture of the disease, whatever be

437
01:12:52,682 --> 01:13:04,282
its kind, is once accurately sketched, the most
difficult part of the task is accomplished.

438
01:13:05,018 --> 01:13:10,786
The physician has then the picture of the
disease, especially if it be a chronic one,

439
01:13:11,706 --> 01:13:19,185
always before him to guide him in his treatment;
he can investigate it in all its parts

440
01:13:20,083 --> 01:13:26,778
and can pick out the characteristic symptoms,
in order to oppose to these, that is

441
01:13:27,130 --> 01:13:34,921
to say, to the whole malady itself, a very
similar artificial morbific force, in the shape

442
01:13:35,449 --> 01:13:42,409
of a homeopathically chosen medicinal
substance, selected from the lists of symptoms

443
01:13:42,834 --> 01:13:48,905
of all the medicines whose pure
effects have been ascertained."

444
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:58,675
He says once you write down the symptoms
in chronic conditions, then you are able

445
01:13:58,986 --> 01:14:05,729
to find which of the remedies that have
been proven, have more similar symptoms

446
01:14:06,305 --> 01:14:12,497
to this particular case. "And when, during
the treatment, he wishes to ascertain

447
01:14:12,850 --> 01:14:18,090
what has been the effect of the medicine,
and what change has taken place in the

448
01:14:18,394 --> 01:14:25,561
patient's state, at this fresh examination
of the patient he only needs to strike out

449
01:14:26,041 --> 01:14:32,185
of the list of the symptoms noted down at
the first visit those that have become

450
01:14:32,538 --> 01:14:40,891
ameliorated, to mark what still remain,
and add any new symptoms that may have

451
01:14:41,489 --> 01:14:43,665
supervened."

452
01:14:45,818 --> 01:14:50,265
Without knowing in the last seminar
I think I have said the same thing.

453
01:14:53,930 --> 01:15:08,130
I said that we don't do a good job in taking
a case, what would be a good job would be

454
01:15:08,930 --> 01:15:14,778
to note down the symptoms one by
one and ask the patient what about

455
01:15:15,130 --> 01:15:18,161
that symptom? It's gone. What
about this symptom? Remains.

456
01:15:18,545 --> 01:15:27,634
What about this symptom...? Do you have
new symptoms? Yes, I have 2 more new

457
01:15:27,994 --> 01:15:34,681
symptoms, then you can go ahead
and find the next remedy.

458
01:15:39,390 --> 01:15:48,341
I have said that without remembering at
all. He has mentioned even that detail.

459
01:15:55,534 --> 01:15:59,173
Any question that
you want to ask?

460
01:16:02,565 --> 01:16:08,949
-It's not only putting down the
symptoms and considering the new ones...

461
01:16:10,830 --> 01:16:17,269
We have to see how the patient feels in
general and how his energy is because

462
01:16:17,565 --> 01:16:22,405
what I saw for example in Indian hospitals,
they are doing that but sometimes

463
01:16:22,741 --> 01:16:24,101
they are missing the point.

464
01:16:28,582 --> 01:16:39,699
-That is true, I have said how you can
evaluate a case and this is different than

465
01:16:40,010 --> 01:16:47,962
what Hahnemann says. He says that the
right thing is that you have written down

466
01:16:48,363 --> 01:16:55,370
in detail all the symptoms and when the
patient comes back, go through the list and

467
01:16:56,338 --> 01:17:01,650
ask him do you still have this symptom,
yes, do you still have this symptom, no,

468
01:17:03,203 --> 01:17:06,875
are you thirsty, do you have
new symptoms and note down.

469
01:17:09,546 --> 01:17:23,139
At this moment he does not say what are
parameters for knowing that a correct

470
01:17:23,451 --> 01:17:30,250
remedy has been given. He just says because
he is very accurate, very detailed,

471
01:17:31,346 --> 01:17:43,116
he says that you have to do that and this
is very important because if we want to do

472
01:17:43,466 --> 01:17:53,779
research and find out what a remedy can
do further than the information we have,

473
01:17:54,331 --> 01:17:57,547
we can find out only
through this way.

474
01:17:58,523 --> 01:18:07,338
Because if we have cases where we have given
Pulsatilla and it has cured a symptom

475
01:18:07,858 --> 01:18:16,674
which is not already recorded, then we have
a symptom for Pulsatilla, so we add to

476
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:28,291
the symptomatology of Pulsatilla. In the
same way when we have given a small remedy

477
01:18:29,667 --> 01:18:36,866
and we have recorded the symptoms in
detail and we can see which symptoms have

478
01:18:37,346 --> 01:18:43,930
changed. In a small remedy it's very important
because it augments the possibility

479
01:18:44,754 --> 01:18:59,098
of that remedy. So what he says is a
practice which if I had done this when I was

480
01:19:00,306 --> 01:19:07,738
starting in the 60s in Athens...

481
01:19:12,714 --> 01:19:22,203
and I had assistance, people who could
write down and then the patient comes and

482
01:19:22,523 --> 01:19:34,299
we see what has been cured, I would have
a wealth of information but it was not

483
01:19:34,666 --> 01:19:40,938
possible for me to do it. Therefore
I relied only on my memory.

484
01:19:41,739 --> 01:19:49,226
So I saw a Pulsatilla case, Pulsatilla aversion
fat, then I had a Pulsatilla which said

485
01:19:49,586 --> 01:19:56,914
I desire pork, I said Ok I will give
you Pulsatilla, comes back, cured.

486
01:20:00,875 --> 01:20:08,266
Thousands of such symptoms were gone
because I did not have the support team,

487
01:20:09,690 --> 01:20:11,674
I was by myself.

488
01:20:14,331 --> 01:20:25,939
I remember a film there was a battalion
that everybody was killed in a fortress and

489
01:20:26,323 --> 01:20:38,922
there was one left and he put all
the soldiers looking through the...

490
01:20:42,946 --> 01:20:50,674
so he was going around with his gun and he
was shooting as if everybody was alive,

491
01:20:51,203 --> 01:20:57,858
so the other people thought they were
fighting with 50 people. There was only one.

492
01:20:58,890 --> 01:21:10,979
I was feeling like this in the beginning. I
just explain why it was not possible for me

493
01:21:11,755 --> 01:21:20,330
to have all this information but today you
have definitely, especially in India, you have

494
01:21:20,906 --> 01:21:27,130
the structure that you may need
to get more and more information.

495
01:21:29,882 --> 01:21:35,439
Because you have a lot of cases, you have a lot
of assistance, a lot of people are interested...

496
01:21:35,687 --> 01:21:42,719
By that time I had converted medical doctors
to Homeopathy to prescribe for them

497
01:21:43,175 --> 01:21:53,455
in order to have patients and be able to
prescribe themselves. I was prescribing

498
01:21:53,839 --> 01:22:01,766
for everyone. How could I find the
time to go through the cases?

499
01:22:02,334 --> 01:22:06,174
It's very nice but difficult.

500
01:22:14,831 --> 01:22:20,390
-Sir, what message you wish to give us in
order to find all this information from what

501
01:22:20,766 --> 01:22:23,406
we are getting in the practice?

502
01:22:38,902 --> 01:22:47,350
-What he says exactly here, write in detail.
The patient has symptoms, write them

503
01:22:47,695 --> 01:22:57,206
in detail and when he comes back you say
you said you had a headache that was

504
01:22:57,566 --> 01:23:05,479
coming at 10 a.m. what happened with it?
It's not anymore. Ok, you had also

505
01:23:05,815 --> 01:23:14,078
constipation what happened? I still have it.
You also said that if you eat sweets you had

506
01:23:14,414 --> 01:23:19,190
an aggravation you had a heartburn,
what happened? This is better.

507
01:23:22,967 --> 01:23:27,833
Do you have new symptoms? Yes. Write
them down. You give the second remedy,

508
01:23:28,072 --> 01:23:36,304
he comes back, again you examine him
according to what you have written and you

509
01:23:36,601 --> 01:23:38,513
examine him.

510
01:23:40,049 --> 01:23:47,600
I remember an American who had been here
as patient she came and I said what

511
01:23:49,104 --> 01:23:56,345
happened? She says I am the same.
Nothing happened, no change? No change.

512
01:23:57,649 --> 01:24:06,665
I said Ok. I opened the computer because
in the computer we had all the symptoms.

513
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:11,616
I said what happened with this symptom? I
don't have it! What happened with this?

514
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:19,376
I don't have it! I went through the whole
list and she did not have any symptom left!

515
01:24:26,464 --> 01:24:30,888
I had all these? You had all
these and now you don't have.

516
01:24:34,241 --> 01:24:55,664
Thank you very much, I'm better. Now the
program keeps it and we can go through.

517
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:09,888
-A question about the totality of symptoms.
Hahnemann says that we have to write

518
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:15,448
down all the symptoms. Did
Hahnemann have an idea of layers?

519
01:25:16,056 --> 01:25:21,840
Because sometimes we cannot prescribe
on totality. What do you think?

520
01:25:26,424 --> 01:25:28,360
-I think Hahnemann
had everything.

521
01:25:35,664 --> 01:25:40,952
I cannot tell you that now but what
they can say is most probably correct.

522
01:25:41,352 --> 01:25:44,440
As we go along you will find it.

523
01:25:46,064 --> 01:25:55,520
-I would like just to tell one thing, from
aphorism 172 to 183 Hahnemann has briefly

524
01:25:55,904 --> 01:26:01,904
explained the strategy about the
Group 3 and 4 cases, how to go.

525
01:26:02,624 --> 01:26:06,791
You give one remedy. You don't have
many symptoms in Group 4 and 3.

526
01:26:07,152 --> 01:26:09,992
How do you explain Hahnemann had said
the same, if you don't have much

527
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:17,624
symptoms, just... then when you give the
remedy, that layer will go and then another

528
01:26:17,968 --> 01:26:22,640
remedy will come, which the patient never
knew about it or might have said it I was

529
01:26:22,952 --> 01:26:28,632
having the symptom and again you catch
that layer symptoms and give the remedy

530
01:26:28,714 --> 01:26:33,449
and beneath another layer will come. Exactly
what you explain about Group 3 and 4

531
01:26:33,746 --> 01:26:34,838
he has explained.

532
01:26:34,938 --> 01:26:55,610
-I believe. Maybe you don't believe it but
in the process I thought I discovered this

533
01:26:55,906 --> 01:27:05,425
and that. When I started teaching the Organon
again I found out he had already said it.

534
01:27:09,768 --> 01:27:15,152
Most probably if we go further, we
will see even more from what Hahnemann

535
01:27:15,657 --> 01:27:17,697
wanted to tell me.

536
01:27:18,553 --> 01:27:24,827
-I used to know that we have found clinically
confirmed symptoms like Staphysagria

537
01:27:25,107 --> 01:27:30,027
sleep on left side, Causticum sleeps on...
there are many confirmations which I have

538
01:27:30,323 --> 01:27:37,387
seen in my practice but unfortunately I don't
have a way to send it in order to have

539
01:27:37,708 --> 01:27:45,684
a proper edition. My question was how we
should proceed in order to make these

540
01:27:46,155 --> 01:27:50,123
clinically confirmed symptoms into the
Repertory in a very authentic way.

541
01:27:53,923 --> 01:28:02,258
-We'll discuss more about it and also we'll
discuss about provings of the remedies.

542
01:28:04,483 --> 01:28:10,883
Dimitri was asking how to do
provings of small remedies from M.M.

543
01:28:11,835 --> 01:28:16,698
We'll discuss it and I'll
give you my ideas about it.

544
01:28:17,508 --> 01:28:22,179
-Because you say in your teachings that if
you are able to find a symptom clinically

545
01:28:22,787 --> 01:28:30,019
for 3 times, then it's confirmed ... I have
a list of symptoms which I have confirmed

546
01:28:30,347 --> 01:28:34,362
for more than 5-6 times,
more than 100 symptoms.

547
01:28:34,699 --> 01:28:37,611
I have a record but I
don't know how to apply...

548
01:28:39,011 --> 01:28:41,243
-Give them to me
and I will apply.

549
01:28:41,971 --> 01:28:55,075
-Definitely yes. With pleasure. I also check
out to see. I will tell you how you can be

550
01:28:55,443 --> 01:29:02,275
certain that a symptoms belongs to
the remedy and not to other things.

551
01:29:02,907 --> 01:29:07,644
But we'll discuss in more
detail about that. Thank you!
