1
00:00:17,955 --> 00:00:22,404
How we proceed... you
had a question?

2
00:00:27,571 --> 00:00:32,107
-After watching
the video before...

3
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:42,883
-I studied your case...so you are
responsible for me not sleeping.

4
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:46,723
You got the answer?

5
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:57,091
-And I have a difficult
question for you now.

6
00:00:58,564 --> 00:01:03,621
After what you have
said in the video case

7
00:01:06,405 --> 00:01:10,837
in order to be alive
the emotion must be alive.

8
00:01:12,805 --> 00:01:15,660
My question is how these people,

9
00:01:17,709 --> 00:01:21,701
who sell their countries, who do
not respect the other people,

10
00:01:22,253 --> 00:01:26,605
who make such a catastrophe in their
families and the next generation...

11
00:01:31,853 --> 00:01:34,460
What is the reason
of their sickness?

12
00:01:39,637 --> 00:01:42,205
-I have written a whole
article about that.

13
00:01:45,589 --> 00:01:51,220
As I said it I sent it to 3 medical
journals, they all refused it,

14
00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:58,717
now there is a fourth one that may
accept it and the chapter of this...

15
00:02:04,645 --> 00:02:07,276
I will not say
research but anyhow...

16
00:02:07,756 --> 00:02:13,180
it says the role of conscience
in triggering disease.

17
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:20,405
The people you are talking about they
sold their conscience to the devil.

18
00:02:20,917 --> 00:02:25,683
-Why?
-Because of money.

19
00:02:27,179 --> 00:02:32,939
They believe more
in material gains.

20
00:02:35,763 --> 00:02:40,018
Power and money.
This is the reason.

21
00:02:40,562 --> 00:02:49,570
Once your conscience
is bought by money,

22
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:53,490
in order to do things
against your conscience,

23
00:02:56,155 --> 00:03:07,339
you start to be deeply sick and then
you can commit crimes of all kinds.

24
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:15,138
The higher power the people
have, the bigger the crime...

25
00:03:16,098 --> 00:03:20,050
Good morning little
one, why are you late?

26
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:35,210
The bigger the power, the greater
the crimes of the people

27
00:03:35,898 --> 00:03:39,802
who have sold their
souls to the devil.

28
00:03:41,106 --> 00:03:43,426
Symbolically I'm talking.

29
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:49,697
I don't believe in devils
but you know what I mean.

30
00:03:54,202 --> 00:03:55,602
She has a question.

31
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:07,554
-I wanted you to tell me a bit about
giving a remedy to a nursing woman.

32
00:04:08,554 --> 00:04:15,250
I took a case of a woman who has a
clear picture of Baryta carbonica

33
00:04:16,034 --> 00:04:19,850
but she has a child
who is 2 months old.

34
00:04:22,355 --> 00:04:25,754
I thought that maybe I
could give her 1M or 10M

35
00:04:26,122 --> 00:04:31,138
but then it's not very clear to me
if the remedy passes to the child.

36
00:04:34,186 --> 00:04:39,074
-This is very clear and I have
said it before. I will repeat it.

37
00:04:39,653 --> 00:04:45,477
When a woman is pregnant and you take
her case and she needs a remedy,

38
00:04:46,485 --> 00:04:51,708
that is the most lucky thing
that can happen to the child.

39
00:04:53,581 --> 00:05:00,557
Because by the mother taking the remedy,
the child also becomes balanced.

40
00:05:01,381 --> 00:05:05,445
To bring out a balanced
child is a fantastic thing.

41
00:05:05,757 --> 00:05:14,789
Otherwise the child comes out with
predisposition ready to be sick etc.

42
00:05:15,717 --> 00:05:28,253
Pregnant and nursing women must take
homeopathic remedy in all cases.

43
00:05:29,749 --> 00:05:36,829
Of course if you have a woman who is nursing
and her heart is in terrible condition,

44
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:42,524
you must be careful with the potency
and don't give a very high one.

45
00:05:42,989 --> 00:05:46,501
But give definitely the remedy.

46
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:49,565
The child will be saved.

47
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:54,037
It's the best thing that can happen
because the mother and the child

48
00:05:54,701 --> 00:06:03,692
at the moment of nursing and during the
pregnancy are considered as the same organism,

49
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:06,645
there is no difference at all.

50
00:06:14,213 --> 00:06:16,068
-It's a general question again.

51
00:06:16,869 --> 00:06:18,989
Sometimes you treat a patient

52
00:06:19,493 --> 00:06:24,981
and you see a partial improvement
that doesn't last for too long

53
00:06:25,917 --> 00:06:30,613
and then there is a relapse
and then you have 2 options.

54
00:06:31,021 --> 00:06:35,348
Sometimes you repeat the remedy that
has acted and other times you say

55
00:06:35,765 --> 00:06:41,326
that the remedy was close, it wasn't
the Similimum but it was similar

56
00:06:41,757 --> 00:06:44,261
and it has acted but it
hasn't cured the case.

57
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:48,885
How can we differentiate
between these 2 cases?

58
00:06:51,156 --> 00:06:59,988
-On the first case, if the remedy was
correct, was based on certain keynotes

59
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:07,939
and you gave a low potency, it did not last
very long, in 2 months there is a relapse.

60
00:07:09,651 --> 00:07:20,572
Once the keynotes are back, you may repeat
the remedy and this is the correct.

61
00:07:22,723 --> 00:07:29,596
If the remedy was not
correct and it was close

62
00:07:30,068 --> 00:07:37,243
and therefore it gave a kind of
amelioration in certain aspects

63
00:07:38,634 --> 00:07:42,762
and then there is a relapse.

64
00:07:44,491 --> 00:07:51,963
In such a case there is no
relapse, it is most probably,

65
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:58,226
because the remedy was not the
exact, the organism is coming back

66
00:07:59,891 --> 00:08:05,915
to the original condition that
it was before the remedy.

67
00:08:06,515 --> 00:08:08,611
Then search for another remedy.

68
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:17,546
The idea is that you have to make
sure that the remedy was acting.

69
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:27,852
That means during the time the organism was
better, the keynotes have disappeared.

70
00:08:28,723 --> 00:08:32,466
There is a relapse, the
keynotes reappear.

71
00:08:33,131 --> 00:08:35,779
The remedy was correct,
you repeat it,

72
00:08:38,011 --> 00:08:43,051
first time the same potency,
later on higher potency.

73
00:08:44,211 --> 00:08:46,435
The second possibility.

74
00:08:46,883 --> 00:08:59,291
The remedy was close,
then the keynotes

75
00:08:59,619 --> 00:09:04,893
on which you prescribed most probably
were not gone during the time

76
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:09,653
when the patient
was saying I am better.

77
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:21,035
You gave Nux vomica to a gastritis
case where there is a lot of heartburns

78
00:09:23,909 --> 00:09:26,461
and it takes away the heartburn.

79
00:09:29,045 --> 00:09:42,565
But the Nux vomica was chosen on certain
other symptoms, which are irritability,

80
00:09:45,012 --> 00:09:47,188
offended easily etc.

81
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:55,340
While the gastritis is better,
the irritability is not better.

82
00:09:56,044 --> 00:10:00,004
The "easily offended"
is not better.

83
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,084
That means the remedy was close.

84
00:10:04,988 --> 00:10:10,396
There is a relapse, there is again
burning in the stomach after eating

85
00:10:10,796 --> 00:10:13,156
or with the least eating etc.

86
00:10:14,797 --> 00:10:17,737
You better find another remedy.
Which can be the other remedy?

87
00:10:18,233 --> 00:10:22,642
A remedy that has burning in the
stomach and the irritability.

88
00:10:22,985 --> 00:10:27,576
Maybe Robinia will be the remedy.
Then you give it.

89
00:10:28,496 --> 00:10:32,280
Or Lilium tigrinum
may be the remedy.

90
00:10:33,408 --> 00:10:41,959
It's like a tiger.
Woman with S tiger character.

91
00:10:43,016 --> 00:10:48,692
-May I ask something on that? If
the keynotes of the physical level

92
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:53,948
and the patient on the mental/
emotional is doing better

93
00:10:54,228 --> 00:11:00,003
but the relapse is on the physical
symptoms, is it still again valid to go...

94
00:11:03,436 --> 00:11:07,068
-You give the remedy
on a gastritis case.

95
00:11:07,636 --> 00:11:13,003
His gastritis is the same
but the irritability is better.

96
00:11:13,492 --> 00:11:15,868
This is what you are saying.

97
00:11:17,284 --> 00:11:21,044
That means most probably
the remedy was correct

98
00:11:21,668 --> 00:11:27,252
but there is an underlying remedy
to cover the remaining symptoms.

99
00:11:28,684 --> 00:11:32,643
What is the other remedy?
Natrum muriaticum or whatever.

100
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:37,276
Or you gave Natrum muriaticum
and the gastritis has remained,

101
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:41,228
I feel better psychologically
but I still have bloatedness.

102
00:11:42,428 --> 00:11:45,868
Lycopodium, the second remedy.

103
00:12:00,216 --> 00:12:06,064
-I have a case of a
child with asthma.

104
00:12:14,535 --> 00:12:21,519
I took the case one year back and
the picture was clear Carcinosin.

105
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:28,504
I have given Carcinosin, the child has
improved very well on mental/ emotional level,

106
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,335
beautiful effect of Similimum.

107
00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:36,992
Physically attacks have reduced, episodes
of acute asthma have also reduced

108
00:12:37,392 --> 00:12:42,776
and all I can see an amelioration
of 60% on physical plane.

109
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:52,311
But now the case is stuck.
I cannot go further.

110
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,920
I have raised the
medicine to CM.

111
00:12:58,128 --> 00:13:00,040
-Forget it.
He needs another remedy.

112
00:13:00,376 --> 00:13:06,088
-Sir, there are no other findings which
I can enter with another remedy.

113
00:13:06,648 --> 00:13:10,503
Best is to repeat the same
medicine with a potency of 2CM.

114
00:13:11,632 --> 00:13:16,016
-If you gave Carcinosin
on certain keynotes.

115
00:13:17,552 --> 00:13:18,952
Do you remember the keynotes?

116
00:13:20,136 --> 00:13:23,272
-The child was
extremely fastidious...

117
00:13:24,128 --> 00:13:26,961
-How old is the child?
-7 years.

118
00:13:27,424 --> 00:13:31,644
Particularly sensitive to criticism,
fastidious, very emotional,

119
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:36,316
with a strong family history of
cancer, used to sleep on left side,

120
00:13:39,101 --> 00:13:43,364
desire for milk... It was an
absolutely confirmed Carcinosin.

121
00:13:45,604 --> 00:13:50,297
-Now all these keynotes are back?
-Much improved.

122
00:13:50,793 --> 00:13:52,985
-Yes but are they back?
-No.

123
00:13:54,153 --> 00:13:56,033
Therefore he needs
another remedy.

124
00:13:59,696 --> 00:14:02,808
Still he keeps on being
fastidious I believe.

125
00:14:03,296 --> 00:14:04,944
-No it's reduced.

126
00:14:06,057 --> 00:14:09,681
The symptoms of Carcinosin on which
I have prescribed are reduced.

127
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:14,161
And there is a beautiful
amelioration with the Similimum

128
00:14:14,641 --> 00:14:18,432
but I am unable to go
further more than 60%...

129
00:14:20,824 --> 00:14:23,367
-He has asthma.
What kind of asthma?

130
00:14:24,351 --> 00:14:30,654
-It was aggravated in the night and he was
being treated with allopathic medicine

131
00:14:31,023 --> 00:14:32,383
since he was 3 years old.

132
00:14:32,815 --> 00:14:35,968
He was in very bad state
of broken immune system

133
00:14:36,647 --> 00:14:45,055
and when I gave the medicine, there was a
classic mental/ emotional amelioration...

134
00:14:45,816 --> 00:14:46,896
-I understand all that.

135
00:14:47,288 --> 00:14:51,759
But I am trying to help you by giving you
some suggestion about the second remedy.

136
00:14:52,303 --> 00:14:57,464
He needs another remedy which comes
underneath, most probably Arsenicum.

137
00:14:57,927 --> 00:14:59,911
Have you tried before
giving Arsenicum?

138
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:03,487
-It is the only medicine which...

139
00:15:03,808 --> 00:15:11,791
-If the asthma comes in the night, if the
child needs in order to sleep a high pillow,

140
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:21,752
if the child is still fastidious, then
most probably he needs another remedy

141
00:15:23,191 --> 00:15:32,337
most probably Arsenicum album.
But if the asthma comes at 4 a.m.

142
00:15:32,969 --> 00:15:36,177
-Now there are no attacks
of asthma anymore.

143
00:15:36,906 --> 00:15:40,434
-Then what do you
want to improve?

144
00:15:41,129 --> 00:15:52,338
-There is wheezing inside the chest
and his mother is a gynecologist.

145
00:15:55,794 --> 00:16:02,949
She has reported me that I am able to
hear wheezing inside almost every time

146
00:16:03,317 --> 00:16:09,093
I auscultate his chest.
Wheezing is there.

147
00:16:10,573 --> 00:16:15,581
-Now the symptom is wheezing. The
remedy now is Kali Sulphuricum.

148
00:16:23,245 --> 00:16:29,564
It can be. Just examine the
possibility of Kali Sulphuricum.

149
00:16:33,686 --> 00:16:37,034
-A few days ago you said commenting
on a case that both Veratrum (album)

150
00:16:37,385 --> 00:16:43,913
and Phosphorus care and
try to help those around.

151
00:16:44,465 --> 00:16:48,345
But you said Veratrum in a different
way but you did not comment more.

152
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:51,081
I want you to comment a little.

153
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:58,969
No, you did not comment
because it was late...

154
00:17:07,233 --> 00:17:10,880
-They are totally different
one from the other.

155
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:21,233
Phosphorus is anxious when he sees
people suffering and he wants to help

156
00:17:24,897 --> 00:17:28,584
because of his own
anxiety feelings.

157
00:17:29,689 --> 00:17:35,417
These people are suffering, they
are not happy, I need to help.

158
00:17:37,361 --> 00:17:40,561
Veratrum is different.

159
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:55,041
Veratrum is a leader that
wants to protect the others,

160
00:17:55,697 --> 00:18:01,504
whoever they might be from being
suppressed, from suffering, whatever.

161
00:18:02,698 --> 00:18:08,097
They both are caring about the other
people but the one is a leader

162
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:14,177
and says don't do this, it is not
correct, he will interfere with you

163
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:18,880
becoming unjust with somebody.

164
00:18:21,553 --> 00:18:31,634
Phosphorus will go himself and try to help
as much as possible the person per se.

165
00:18:34,137 --> 00:18:42,009
Veratrum album needs to show that
he is a protector of humans.

166
00:18:43,577 --> 00:18:45,297
Needs to show it.

167
00:18:46,849 --> 00:18:49,952
Phosphorus does not
need to show it.

168
00:18:50,801 --> 00:18:56,729
It's caring but does
not need to show it.

169
00:18:59,649 --> 00:19:01,817
Do you understand
the difference?

170
00:19:03,617 --> 00:19:17,409
Both are bleeding from the nose, both need
cold water and cold things in the mouth,

171
00:19:17,873 --> 00:19:25,120
ice cream and ice cubes but
they are quite different.

172
00:19:25,505 --> 00:19:35,162
The one is a leader and a
prophet, repent... he goes out

173
00:19:35,489 --> 00:19:42,808
and says to people "Repent! You
are sinners! I need to save you!"

174
00:19:43,441 --> 00:19:48,537
Like me, I never took Veratrum.
Now it comes to my mind

175
00:19:49,193 --> 00:19:56,937
I may need a dose of Veratrum! But I never
had nosebleed and I don't like cold water.

176
00:19:59,153 --> 00:20:09,703
Anyhow I can take a dose... That is the
difference and these are the similarities.

177
00:20:18,487 --> 00:20:24,727
-The last time with the German group you
gave an explanation in the Law of Similars,

178
00:20:25,143 --> 00:20:33,223
how Hahnemann sees the artificial disease,
it has to be a stronger in order to cure

179
00:20:33,967 --> 00:20:40,071
and you were explaining that this kind
of explanation would be a suppression.

180
00:20:44,582 --> 00:20:50,742
It has not to be a
stronger suppression

181
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:56,095
because Hahnemann just finds
a way to explain the law.

182
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:02,678
But in a practical way this has some
difference between his explanation

183
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:04,792
and your explanation.

184
00:21:05,911 --> 00:21:13,863
This has clinical consequences because
it is very delicate to interpret

185
00:21:14,383 --> 00:21:18,535
every phrase of Hahnemann
particularly the Law of Similars...

186
00:21:19,686 --> 00:21:23,342
You gave another
explanation, different.

187
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:35,288
-This is one of the first things
that concern me, his explanation.

188
00:21:35,704 --> 00:21:37,407
The fact also, he was saying,

189
00:21:37,999 --> 00:21:44,670
I am going to tell you how it
works (the homeopathic remedies),

190
00:21:45,199 --> 00:21:48,375
what is the paragraph of this?

191
00:21:48,951 --> 00:21:51,343
No, wait a moment,
I will remind you.

192
00:21:51,718 --> 00:22:06,967
He says I can tell you how the similar
remedy acts but it's not important.

193
00:22:30,638 --> 00:22:36,758
Paragraph 28, "As this natural
law of cure manifests itself

194
00:22:37,086 --> 00:22:43,270
in every pure experiment and every
true observation in the world,

195
00:22:45,014 --> 00:22:48,894
the fact is consequently
established..."

196
00:22:49,018 --> 00:22:52,394
There is no question
about the Law of Cure.

197
00:22:56,107 --> 00:23:13,059
"...it matters little what may be scientific
explanation of how it takes place (the cure)".

198
00:23:14,763 --> 00:23:20,426
It's the first time that Hahnemann
has some doubts of what he says

199
00:23:21,754 --> 00:23:34,434
and he says "and I do not attach much
importance to the attempts made to explain it.

200
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:47,262
But the following view seems to commend
itself as the most probable one,... "

201
00:23:51,645 --> 00:23:58,709
He is full of doubts about the
explanation he was going to give.

202
00:24:03,838 --> 00:24:10,086
"...as it is founded on premises
derived from experience. "

203
00:24:15,013 --> 00:24:22,677
Hahnemann had some observations
with acute epidemic diseases.

204
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:30,621
He said if there is an acute disease
and there is at the same time

205
00:24:31,181 --> 00:24:34,925
another epidemic disease
going on in the area,

206
00:24:35,886 --> 00:24:41,533
if this new disease is stronger
than the one I already have

207
00:24:42,646 --> 00:24:49,557
and I contract the second as well,
then most probably the stronger one

208
00:24:50,085 --> 00:24:56,949
will suppress the previous one
which I have, will run its course

209
00:24:58,574 --> 00:25:05,437
and afterwards the weaker one will
come and will also run its course.

210
00:25:07,829 --> 00:25:18,142
But he says if I have a disease which
is stronger and another epidemic

211
00:25:18,542 --> 00:25:24,269
which is weaker, I cannot
get it, cannot be affected.

212
00:25:25,621 --> 00:25:37,158
If it happens that the 2 acute diseases are
similar in nature, one will cure the other.

213
00:25:46,349 --> 00:25:55,149
On these ideas he was explaining
the action of the remedy

214
00:25:56,229 --> 00:26:04,229
but you have to take into consideration that
these observations are not valid anymore

215
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:06,285
in our societies.

216
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:13,245
In our societies we do not
allow anymore epidemics.

217
00:26:13,981 --> 00:26:20,429
We have eliminated the epidemics through
manipulation of the immune system

218
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,205
of the human organism.

219
00:26:22,661 --> 00:26:34,229
We have made the human organism in
such a way as to not accept the acute.

220
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:35,453
Why?

221
00:26:36,325 --> 00:27:00,013
Because we have created in us a subacute
condition which is stronger than the acute.

222
00:27:05,261 --> 00:27:14,574
We are deeply sick and therefore the
acute which is around cannot touch me

223
00:27:15,254 --> 00:27:17,310
because it protects me.

224
00:27:19,142 --> 00:27:24,622
In the same way, the same observation
of Hahnemann, the difference is that

225
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:30,669
we do not allow anymore the acute
condition to play the game.

226
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:45,141
Because we suppress the acute conditions,
making the organism sick on a permanent,

227
00:27:45,677 --> 00:27:48,261
chronic condition.

228
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:54,758
So we have permanently a
subacute condition going on.

229
00:27:55,502 --> 00:27:59,518
And outside there is an acute
going around and there are people

230
00:27:59,877 --> 00:28:07,646
who are going to sanatoriums
and are not affected.

231
00:28:08,438 --> 00:28:13,318
There are people who go around sick
people with influenza, any epidemic

232
00:28:13,846 --> 00:28:15,589
and are not affected.

233
00:28:16,957 --> 00:28:18,829
This is not a good sign.

234
00:28:21,445 --> 00:28:28,501
We learn from western medicine
that this is protection.

235
00:28:28,838 --> 00:28:31,078
We protected the population.

236
00:28:31,902 --> 00:28:37,861
We protected the population because
we made it sicker inside.

237
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:44,341
We are sick in a deep level.

238
00:28:53,093 --> 00:28:55,222
Let us say schizophrenia...

239
00:28:58,814 --> 00:29:07,318
Would you say that schizophrenia is an
inflammation of a part of the brain?

240
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:14,781
You would never say that. We do
not know what schizophrenia is.

241
00:29:15,637 --> 00:29:24,557
Once I have said this theory that all chronic
diseases are of inflammatory nature,

242
00:29:26,677 --> 00:29:29,045
ten years ago, some years
ago, I don't remember.

243
00:29:30,125 --> 00:29:37,577
It was 3 years ago that one of my students
brought me a research from the U. S. A.

244
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:41,377
saying that they
have found out now

245
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:46,713
that schizophrenia is of an
inflammatory causative factor.

246
00:29:48,185 --> 00:29:49,849
Thank you very much.

247
00:29:50,329 --> 00:29:58,153
Now if the inflammation is in the brain
forget it, nothing can touch this person.

248
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:03,202
He is protected from all
diseases, even the worst.

249
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:10,265
I have said many times make the
experiment and let a schizophrenic

250
00:30:10,585 --> 00:30:18,946
go with a person who has active
syphilis, have as much sex as he likes.

251
00:30:20,882 --> 00:30:32,746
He will never contract syphilis,
gonorrhea , tuberculosis , Ebola virus.

252
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:48,954
I do not know. If there is any
substance, any nosological entity

253
00:30:49,906 --> 00:31:00,188
that can overcome the resistance
from a psychotic person.

254
00:31:00,668 --> 00:31:07,251
A psychotic person
cannot get any acute.

255
00:31:10,331 --> 00:31:16,379
I bring bad news I know
but these are the facts.

256
00:31:20,028 --> 00:31:29,508
So my difference on this
matter with Hahnemann

257
00:31:34,228 --> 00:31:40,139
who says that the artificial
disease is stronger

258
00:31:40,579 --> 00:31:49,820
and therefore it pushes the natural disease
and that is how a cure is accomplished,

259
00:31:50,996 --> 00:32:03,692
we disagree because the most
logical and natural thing is this.

260
00:32:06,467 --> 00:32:15,147
The immune system once it is
attacked responds with symptoms.

261
00:32:17,323 --> 00:32:21,283
We do not know the
disease as such,

262
00:32:21,891 --> 00:32:27,379
we know always the response of the
immune system in the form of symptoms.

263
00:32:27,892 --> 00:32:37,964
There is high fever, coughing, headaches...
these form the response of the immune system

264
00:32:38,347 --> 00:32:40,683
to counteract the disease.

265
00:32:42,475 --> 00:32:46,683
So what is more logical then?

266
00:32:48,276 --> 00:33:05,316
If we have a tool that if it is given to an
organism, it produces a similar set of symptoms.

267
00:33:07,651 --> 00:33:15,867
So we give it and then because the organism
is already trying with these symptoms,

268
00:33:16,467 --> 00:33:22,915
we give a remedy that produces
the same set of symptoms.

269
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:30,635
What is going to happen? It is
natural to increase the symptoms.

270
00:33:31,355 --> 00:33:35,107
Because you have already an effort
of the organism producing symptoms,

271
00:33:35,692 --> 00:33:43,907
you give a remedy that also produces
the symptoms, the organism augments,

272
00:33:44,891 --> 00:33:52,131
aggravates the symptoms and then we
say we have the initial aggravation.

273
00:33:53,348 --> 00:33:58,092
This is the way we say when there
is an initial aggravation,

274
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:09,444
it means that the organism is
strong and has reacted very well.

275
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:16,147
Because after the initial aggravation
there is an amelioration and a cure,

276
00:34:17,044 --> 00:34:19,059
the disease is gone.

277
00:34:19,531 --> 00:34:27,179
The fact that the organism suffering with
a chronic condition with the inflammation

278
00:34:27,571 --> 00:34:32,307
which comes up and down
all the time inside,

279
00:34:32,668 --> 00:34:45,596
so there is always a migraine coming
that lasts 2 days, then it goes away.

280
00:34:45,891 --> 00:34:54,907
Then after 10 days the migraine is back or
the inflammation in the joints they come

281
00:34:55,467 --> 00:35:03,507
and are stimulated, then subside
for a while then back again.

282
00:35:03,836 --> 00:35:07,980
The organism all these years that
is sick with a chronic condition

283
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:13,971
is trying through these
inflammations from time to time

284
00:35:14,875 --> 00:35:20,355
making a bigger inflammation to get
rid of the disease but cannot.

285
00:35:21,308 --> 00:35:29,147
So we give him the extra energy he needs,
in order to overcome finally the disease.

286
00:35:29,923 --> 00:35:36,147
Every effort, every headache is an
effort of the organism to cure itself.

287
00:35:37,788 --> 00:35:47,136
Every symptom which exist is an effort of the
organism in order to get rid of the disease.

288
00:35:48,792 --> 00:35:51,671
It cannot.
Why?

289
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:59,687
He does not have enough because he is prevented
by what we call the miasmatic layers.

290
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:09,511
He has like a blockage and
tries again and again.

291
00:36:10,911 --> 00:36:23,968
That is why in simpler cases, we say you
rest, you eat better, don't get excited,

292
00:36:25,368 --> 00:36:31,640
be calm and a
recovery can happen.

293
00:36:35,208 --> 00:36:37,088
Don't spend your energy.

294
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,848
If you spend your energy,
you will be sick.

295
00:36:45,223 --> 00:36:49,695
When do you get a coryza?
When you get a cold?

296
00:36:50,047 --> 00:36:56,991
When you have exerted yourself and your
energy is low and then the microbes

297
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:08,912
find a way to come and then the organism
says STOP otherwise you will die.

298
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:11,327
No I don't stop.

299
00:37:11,727 --> 00:37:15,959
You say I have a coryza and then
the coryza goes to the pharynx

300
00:37:16,263 --> 00:37:23,191
and you get a pharyngitis...
then I have a pneumonia.

301
00:37:24,535 --> 00:37:29,329
It says I told you,
you should lie down...

302
00:37:31,201 --> 00:37:33,697
This is normal.

303
00:37:34,881 --> 00:37:41,041
The homeopathic remedy gives
you the extra energy,

304
00:37:41,442 --> 00:37:52,866
releases the energy which exists in the
organism but is blocked and cannot act.

305
00:37:53,953 --> 00:37:58,673
The homeopathic remedy releases that
energy which the organism needs

306
00:37:59,058 --> 00:38:02,257
in order to overcome
the disease.

307
00:38:05,841 --> 00:38:20,946
So this is the most probable explanation of
how it is explained the Law of Similars.

308
00:38:22,281 --> 00:38:32,946
The Law of Similars has to be
accepted as a universal law.

309
00:38:40,426 --> 00:38:47,828
All the good things that happen
in the life of a person is

310
00:38:48,156 --> 00:38:52,403
because of the Law of Similars.

311
00:39:17,756 --> 00:39:20,740
You have a friend for who you say
we are thinking the same way,

312
00:39:23,891 --> 00:39:25,851
we are feeling the
same things etc.

313
00:39:27,123 --> 00:39:30,755
You come together and there
is energy, happiness.

314
00:39:31,484 --> 00:39:35,684
This energy is the Law
of Similars working.

315
00:39:38,964 --> 00:39:41,796
Because you found
somebody who is similar.

316
00:39:42,315 --> 00:39:43,971
Now why do we need that?

317
00:39:44,316 --> 00:39:59,955
Because we are limited and we need
to find that support in a friend,

318
00:40:02,515 --> 00:40:09,211
in a relationship between men and women,
between women and women, men and men...

319
00:40:09,716 --> 00:40:14,028
But you need that relationship to give
you the energy and you say I'm happy,

320
00:40:14,404 --> 00:40:16,100
when I am with that person.

321
00:40:23,043 --> 00:40:27,339
You cannot understand
anything from the outside.

322
00:40:27,876 --> 00:40:30,476
It all happens on
an energy level.

323
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:35,316
This is the similarity

324
00:40:35,811 --> 00:40:46,003
and then the Law of Similars becomes
universal and, as I have said,

325
00:40:50,620 --> 00:41:06,460
all the people who are trying
to reach a state of enlightment

326
00:41:07,747 --> 00:41:15,691
or a state of bliss or a state
of spiritual completeness,

327
00:41:17,451 --> 00:41:23,267
all these are based on
the Law of Similars.

328
00:41:26,291 --> 00:41:34,620
The problem is we understand
that in order to approach God

329
00:41:34,939 --> 00:41:40,083
or whatever you call it in every religion,
you have to have certain qualities,

330
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:49,011
otherwise you cannot.
It's like a blockage.

331
00:41:49,772 --> 00:42:03,451
Once these qualities on your conscience become
similar to the qualities of the divine nature,

332
00:42:08,124 --> 00:42:19,852
then there is a possibility of
humans to approach the idea of God

333
00:42:20,259 --> 00:42:24,619
and something happens inside
the brain at a certain moment,

334
00:42:25,132 --> 00:42:38,876
a click that releases something which is,
some Orthodox say that is the grace of God,

335
00:42:39,612 --> 00:42:46,619
some call it yoga...
but there is a click

336
00:42:47,267 --> 00:42:55,716
in which you enter a new dimension in
understanding which is far beyond anything

337
00:42:56,012 --> 00:42:57,764
you have lived before.

338
00:42:58,468 --> 00:43:01,228
It is such a bliss,
such a completeness.

339
00:43:03,563 --> 00:43:08,579
The saint people have described
it in different religions.

340
00:43:09,027 --> 00:43:12,155
These states are real,
they are existing.

341
00:43:12,747 --> 00:43:26,227
These people have tried very hard
to become similar to the divine.

342
00:43:31,892 --> 00:43:36,692
It happens only to these people
who have attained the qualities.

343
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:46,491
Because we say yoga, you sit there
and... you can do that, it is an effort.

344
00:43:47,715 --> 00:43:57,235
But you cannot ever have the click inside
unless you have attained the qualities...

345
00:43:57,579 --> 00:44:17,163
Which are the qualities? Love, justice,
sincerity, honesty, helping others, love,

346
00:44:18,211 --> 00:44:21,059
loving myself is not enough.

347
00:44:21,803 --> 00:44:24,923
Love is to care about
others and to help others.

348
00:44:28,276 --> 00:44:47,684
So the qualities more and more
similar to what we call the divine.

349
00:45:06,059 --> 00:45:14,067
The Indian philosophy or spiritualism
has analyzed these things

350
00:45:24,692 --> 00:45:31,411
and then they gave it to their
books... Very great analysis.

351
00:45:31,739 --> 00:45:40,507
In the same way the Orthodox did it and gave
it to philokalia, books of the Fathers.

352
00:45:40,747 --> 00:45:45,795
They gave the keys of their
understanding of what they needed to do

353
00:45:46,091 --> 00:45:48,363
in order to have that click.

354
00:45:51,620 --> 00:46:02,419
Unless this was a fact, the bliss that
comes, people could not live in a monastery.

355
00:46:05,195 --> 00:46:17,613
They would say goodbye very soon, unless
they felt this total silence within yourself

356
00:46:18,573 --> 00:46:22,983
and the feeling of bliss coming
a little bit in the beginning

357
00:46:24,176 --> 00:46:33,705
until you have the big experience which
is described by the saints of our times.

358
00:46:36,456 --> 00:46:41,512
This is the Law of Similars.
It is the same Law.

359
00:46:46,952 --> 00:46:50,784
Yes, Carlos.

360
00:46:52,744 --> 00:46:56,008
-I was about to
share a crazy idea.

361
00:46:56,624 --> 00:47:03,727
Because many times in my mind I am struggling
with this subject, Homeopathy, Allopathy

362
00:47:04,448 --> 00:47:05,792
and how to prove it.

363
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:12,680
I don't know if you know somebody
who is working to create a device

364
00:47:17,191 --> 00:47:25,727
that can measure the vital energy,
that it would be very simple,

365
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:31,944
very cheap in order that
everybody can have this device.

366
00:47:32,648 --> 00:47:37,416
Because in this way we will
prove the effect of Homeopathy

367
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,824
and the effect of
Allopathy, as well.

368
00:47:41,848 --> 00:47:44,760
For example a measure of 100.

369
00:47:45,984 --> 00:47:56,088
We give a remedy and if it's right it has to
increase the level of the electromagnetic fields.

370
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:04,632
Something that really
represents the state.

371
00:48:06,368 --> 00:48:08,776
-Your idea is quite correct.

372
00:48:09,903 --> 00:48:13,031
The correct remedy
organizes the field

373
00:48:14,168 --> 00:48:21,456
and the wrong remedy or the
allopathic, confuses the field.

374
00:48:24,934 --> 00:48:28,829
-Most probably the people who will
discover it, they will be killed

375
00:48:29,661 --> 00:48:37,773
because for Allopathy, if the people have
this small device and they take this medicine

376
00:48:38,637 --> 00:48:44,373
and the energy goes down, it's a
clean proof that something is wrong.

377
00:48:44,854 --> 00:48:49,693
And it's a prove of Homeopathy as well,
if you give a remedy that is correct

378
00:48:50,253 --> 00:48:54,293
and the energy organizes
the organism to be better.

379
00:48:55,462 --> 00:49:02,543
-In the National Institute of Health
in the U. S. they found that box

380
00:49:03,326 --> 00:49:10,790
in which you enter and measure your
energy field in Washington D. C.

381
00:49:11,366 --> 00:49:16,069
One time they invited me also and said come,
we would like to ask you some questions.

382
00:49:18,918 --> 00:49:22,750
I said I was very tired, I had
to come back here in Athens

383
00:49:23,326 --> 00:49:26,366
and they sent one of the
doctors to discuss.

384
00:49:26,998 --> 00:49:35,447
He was telling me they wanted to measure
the electromagnetic field actually.

385
00:49:38,974 --> 00:49:44,830
We discussed quite a lot and I said to him
it's going to be very difficult to do that

386
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:53,893
because there are so many electromagnetic
fields interfering in the environment

387
00:49:55,014 --> 00:50:00,014
and the box in which you could
measure purely, does not exist.

388
00:50:00,438 --> 00:50:07,789
Actually they had experiments in
100m in a box under the earth.

389
00:50:08,686 --> 00:50:13,998
Still the electromagnetic field
of the earth interferes.

390
00:50:15,022 --> 00:50:19,614
So I don't know if they
will ever manage to do it.

391
00:50:20,406 --> 00:50:23,205
But this is an old idea...

392
00:50:27,606 --> 00:50:34,286
-We can measure and it can be
representing in a screen the real state.

393
00:50:35,206 --> 00:50:38,454
It would be a great
proof, I think.

394
00:50:42,982 --> 00:50:45,636
-One more question and
then we go ahead.

395
00:50:46,364 --> 00:50:52,293
-Hello. I just wanted to tell
you how true your explanations

396
00:50:52,692 --> 00:50:56,516
were regarding the Law of
Similars in relationships.

397
00:51:06,052 --> 00:51:09,228
In India where there are
only arranged marriages...

398
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:12,948
-I will tell you something more.

399
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:16,428
I have said many times

400
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:27,604
that if people do not indulge in
sexual experience from early age,

401
00:51:28,612 --> 00:51:36,820
they have the possibility to meet the person
with whom they have that great similarity.

402
00:51:38,516 --> 00:51:43,531
So it's like one remedy
would do the trick.

403
00:51:44,532 --> 00:51:50,188
One person will do the trick
also when coming in contact

404
00:51:50,868 --> 00:51:58,195
which will be the exact opposite
pole of each other which they need

405
00:51:58,892 --> 00:52:01,508
in order to be complete.

406
00:52:01,852 --> 00:52:09,820
Therefore the energy which is given then
in a state of 2 individuals being together

407
00:52:11,508 --> 00:52:19,619
and not be contaminated by
previous sexual experiences,

408
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:28,508
this couple can remain forever
together with a lot of pleasure.

409
00:52:29,548 --> 00:52:38,642
Not only physical but
also spiritual pleasure.

410
00:52:39,388 --> 00:52:46,066
Because it is like the correct remedy,
so if you find the correct person

411
00:52:46,513 --> 00:52:51,241
there is a great explosion
of love and energy.

412
00:52:52,057 --> 00:53:02,841
But this in order to happen you do not have
to confuse the case by trying this and that.

413
00:53:04,969 --> 00:53:12,010
In our culture they say I
have to try a lot of cases,

414
00:53:12,458 --> 00:53:16,873
so I will see which is finally the best.
Forget it.

415
00:53:17,481 --> 00:53:25,421
You can never find the best.
The organ is confused.

416
00:53:25,677 --> 00:53:28,141
They cannot recognize
the correct.

417
00:53:28,589 --> 00:53:36,092
So when it comes even a person passing by in
front of the person will not recognize it.

418
00:53:37,909 --> 00:53:46,966
Because it's damaged the organ
by experiences which are stupid.

419
00:53:49,982 --> 00:53:55,253
They will kill me but it's Ok.
I don't mind.

420
00:53:57,893 --> 00:54:00,669
That means you have done this?

421
00:54:01,069 --> 00:54:05,181
No I have not! I have
done the wrong way also.

422
00:54:06,462 --> 00:54:10,741
But realizing what I have
done, I have done wrong.

423
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:13,669
That's the difference.

424
00:54:14,085 --> 00:54:21,629
Don't tell me if I experiment and I go with
this and that, have lots of experience,

425
00:54:21,966 --> 00:54:25,022
then I get married.
Forget it.

426
00:54:25,669 --> 00:54:33,678
You will get a divorce
sooner or later.

427
00:54:33,949 --> 00:54:44,061
You cannot recognize your partner
really because the organ is confused.

428
00:54:45,325 --> 00:54:48,573
You are not pure anymore.

429
00:54:51,613 --> 00:54:53,869
How can you recognize?

430
00:54:58,310 --> 00:54:59,774
I have to say this.

431
00:55:00,246 --> 00:55:07,381
Maybe some people eventually they
realize that it is not good.

432
00:55:07,661 --> 00:55:11,117
When I was in America they said
treat my son, how old is he?

433
00:55:11,805 --> 00:55:22,645
He is 15, why treat him? Because he is still
stuck with the family, what do you mean?

434
00:55:23,765 --> 00:55:29,317
He does not have girlfriend,
doesn't go out, he is sick!

435
00:55:29,997 --> 00:55:36,588
According to American culture
a man or a woman who is 15

436
00:55:37,013 --> 00:55:44,605
and has not gone yet to have
sex, is a sick individual.

437
00:55:47,997 --> 00:55:55,821
I was there in the 80s 30 years ago
and I would take cases like that

438
00:55:56,133 --> 00:55:58,757
and I could hear
things of that type.

439
00:56:00,125 --> 00:56:04,325
Give a remedy, so he
can go with girls.

440
00:56:09,094 --> 00:56:12,861
I said the child is normal,
why should I give?

441
00:56:14,029 --> 00:56:17,437
Do you have other children?
I have 7.

442
00:56:17,733 --> 00:56:19,357
Where are they?
They are all gone.

443
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:21,749
Where?

444
00:56:22,565 --> 00:56:29,509
And then he was a naval
general in the submarines.

445
00:56:31,501 --> 00:56:39,909
He says, some we know where they are,
some we don't know where they are,

446
00:56:40,181 --> 00:56:43,709
one was caught and is in jail,
the other is in narcotics...

447
00:56:45,190 --> 00:56:48,254
They were telling me, as
if it was very simple.

448
00:56:48,678 --> 00:56:51,198
They got out, had
these experiences,

449
00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:59,493
was caught, put in jail, the other is
in narcotics... I could not understand.

450
00:56:59,829 --> 00:57:04,829
This was a cultural
shock for me.

451
00:57:07,686 --> 00:57:11,446
I don't have any remedy
to give to your son.

452
00:57:21,566 --> 00:57:30,222
-So in India when a boy and a girl get
married, before that they match the horoscope.

453
00:57:30,853 --> 00:57:37,346
They match the horoscope and if they are
quite similar and if they are max similar,

454
00:57:37,822 --> 00:57:39,382
that means they
have to be matched.

455
00:57:39,799 --> 00:57:43,333
So if we have similar more than 25,
the marriage will be compatible.

456
00:57:44,142 --> 00:57:47,613
And we have seen that if the
compatibility was less than 25,

457
00:57:48,549 --> 00:57:50,445
they get married but
they get divorced.

458
00:57:51,782 --> 00:57:54,246
-What she says, is
correct unfortunately.

459
00:57:54,702 --> 00:58:08,052
We mock against astrology but their culture
is based on the astrological charts,

460
00:58:09,428 --> 00:58:13,075
which the parents bring together
before the people have met.

461
00:58:13,539 --> 00:58:16,275
Do they match? Yes,
bring them together.

462
00:58:18,123 --> 00:58:25,867
And their marriages by the time I was
living in India were 95% constant.

463
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:31,691
Now they have
rejected this idea.

464
00:58:33,219 --> 00:58:37,467
Marriages are breaking
much more frequently.

465
00:58:37,956 --> 00:58:39,860
-In metropolitan cities...

466
00:58:40,172 --> 00:58:43,836
-You experiment the same
way we have done it here.

467
00:58:45,084 --> 00:58:51,027
They are not taught by what suffering
we have brought upon ourselves.

468
00:58:51,667 --> 00:58:54,123
Nobody realizes the suffering.

469
00:58:59,132 --> 00:59:02,948
-Even so with the horoscope we can
understand what was the past of the boy,

470
00:59:03,316 --> 00:59:06,651
what will be the future of the
boy or girl, what is the character,

471
00:59:07,427 --> 00:59:11,307
how many partners he may have had before
the marriage and after it... everything.

472
00:59:15,084 --> 00:59:18,844
-Her father is an astrologist.

473
00:59:19,404 --> 00:59:26,594
-My family, we have a temple and
my grandfather is a priest.

474
00:59:28,026 --> 00:59:31,025
So we have a deep
knowledge about it.

475
00:59:31,897 --> 00:59:40,825
-I said it as a joke... That's another
story, I don't want to talk about it

476
00:59:41,058 --> 00:59:44,082
but what she says is true.

477
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:51,849
Their culture is based on the information
given by the astrologust when 2 people match.

478
00:59:53,001 --> 01:00:01,771
And the fact that people remain together
for many, many years is a proof

479
01:00:02,404 --> 01:00:05,676
that these people know
something we don't know.

480
01:00:07,244 --> 01:00:08,188
That's all.

481
01:00:13,003 --> 01:00:15,339
What was the paragraph?

482
01:00:17,163 --> 01:00:25,644
105, "The second point of the
business of a true physician

483
01:00:27,236 --> 01:00:34,923
related to acquiring a knowledge of
the instruments intended for the cure

484
01:00:35,347 --> 01:00:42,731
of the natural diseases, investigating
the pathogenetic power of the medicines,

485
01:00:43,884 --> 01:00:51,691
in order, when called on to cure, to
be able to select from among them one,

486
01:00:52,388 --> 01:00:57,588
from the list of whose symptoms an
artificial disease may be constructed,

487
01:00:58,308 --> 01:01:04,140
as similar as possible to the
totality of the principal symptoms

488
01:01:04,708 --> 01:01:08,811
of the natural disease
sought to be cured. "

489
01:01:09,172 --> 01:01:16,357
I don't like the word "business" and I
was wondering, you German can tell me,

490
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:28,684
what is the world in paragraph 105, "the
second point of the business" or the work

491
01:01:28,996 --> 01:01:33,332
or the mission.
You cannot find it.

492
01:01:33,748 --> 01:01:34,908
I thought you...

493
01:01:35,252 --> 01:01:36,460
-I found it but it
is the same word.

494
01:01:36,908 --> 01:01:45,294
It is the actual translation.
He doesn't use "purpose".

495
01:01:47,677 --> 01:01:49,269
-Did it have a different
meaning during that time?

496
01:01:50,157 --> 01:01:55,317
-No. It's actually
the word "business".

497
01:01:55,646 --> 01:01:58,454
-"Business" actually
means my work.

498
01:02:00,198 --> 01:02:01,534
-Occupation.

499
01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:11,677
-Today it means I do something that I
earn money which maybe is not correct...

500
01:02:12,814 --> 01:02:19,630
Good businessmen earn a lot of
money against others who do not.

501
01:02:20,198 --> 01:02:22,933
-It has both
connotations in German.

502
01:02:25,173 --> 01:02:31,853
-In German the word business like "Beschaft"
[also means "occupy"] if a dog pees

503
01:02:32,150 --> 01:02:37,183
in front of your car, we say he did its
"Beschaft" or if he shits in front of your car...

504
01:02:40,629 --> 01:02:47,245
Also has the meaning of "task".

505
01:02:53,366 --> 01:02:56,213
-I would like to change
this word to "task".

506
01:03:00,117 --> 01:03:07,774
Because if I were Hahnemann myself I
could have the right to change the word.

507
01:03:13,158 --> 01:03:15,909
I change the word
"business" to "task".

508
01:03:18,198 --> 01:03:27,270
The task that a homeopath has, is
to learn the provings of remedies,

509
01:03:28,734 --> 01:03:36,597
what the remedies can produce as symptoms
and select the best possible remedy.

510
01:03:37,198 --> 01:03:40,622
That is easy for
everyone to understand.

511
01:03:40,894 --> 01:03:49,181
106, "The whole pathogenetic effect of
the several medicines must be known;

512
01:03:51,293 --> 01:03:54,725
that is to say, all the morbid
symptoms and alterations in the health

513
01:03:55,071 --> 01:03:59,542
that each of them is specially capable
of developing in the healthy individual

514
01:04:00,622 --> 01:04:03,270
must first have been
observed as far as possible,

515
01:04:04,054 --> 01:04:09,453
before we can hope to be able to find among them,
and to select, suitable homoeopathic remedies

516
01:04:10,093 --> 01:04:11,957
for most of the
natural disease."

517
01:04:12,839 --> 01:04:16,334
He says that the provings have
to be as complete as possible

518
01:04:16,990 --> 01:04:22,814
to know all the possible alterations that the
remedy can bring about the human organism,

519
01:04:23,789 --> 01:04:28,429
in order to be able to select
the most similar remedy.

520
01:04:30,406 --> 01:04:37,350
We have to know not only that the remedy
produces diarrhea, that's not enough.

521
01:04:42,125 --> 01:04:47,757
We have to know the complete
symptomatology of the remedy.

522
01:04:52,550 --> 01:05:02,222
107, "If, in order to ascertain this,
medicines be given to sick persons only,

523
01:05:03,285 --> 01:05:07,981
even though they be
administered singly and alone,

524
01:05:08,686 --> 01:05:16,486
then little or nothing precise
is seen of their true effects."

525
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:25,470
This is very important for
provings of new remedies.

526
01:05:27,918 --> 01:05:39,086
He says if a remedy is given to a sick
person, you will never get reliable symptoms

527
01:05:40,182 --> 01:05:46,447
because he says "...as those
peculiar alterations of the health

528
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:55,056
to be expected from the medicine are mixed
up with the symptoms of the disease

529
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:59,416
and can seldom be
distinctly observed."

530
01:06:00,432 --> 01:06:05,138
You see here why I
shout for many years.

531
01:06:13,585 --> 01:06:18,697
The proving craziness is so
great all over the world.

532
01:06:19,994 --> 01:06:25,866
Wait a moment you cannot prove
remedies just like that.

533
01:06:26,330 --> 01:06:34,906
Because you can gather anybody who wants
to be part of a proving, take the remedy.

534
01:06:38,578 --> 01:06:50,049
Usually 1 dose of 30CH of the remedy,
and then they collect the symptoms

535
01:06:50,369 --> 01:06:55,553
from all of them and they have
now collected 2000 symptoms.

536
01:06:59,922 --> 01:07:05,530
How did you collect 2000
symptoms from a dose of 30CH

537
01:07:05,801 --> 01:07:12,249
which was given to a group of 10 people?
It must be the imagination of the people,

538
01:07:12,946 --> 01:07:15,730
not the real proving.

539
01:07:16,010 --> 01:07:29,890
It's not possible because in order
a remedy in 30CH or higher potency

540
01:07:30,730 --> 01:07:43,906
can give symptoms it has to be very
close to the energy level of the person

541
01:07:46,297 --> 01:07:49,713
otherwise it will
be like placebo.

542
01:07:52,938 --> 01:07:58,234
I choose a substance and 2 of you
are sensitive to that substance,

543
01:07:59,281 --> 01:08:06,217
only the 2 of you can have symptoms.
The rest 50 people won't get any.

544
01:08:06,986 --> 01:08:14,954
It's not possible you get symptoms because
the remedy was chosen arbitrarily

545
01:08:19,617 --> 01:08:27,825
but hit only 2 people who may be sensitive
to that substance, not everyone.

546
01:08:28,434 --> 01:08:34,441
Here they make a proving and
everyone pours out symptoms.

547
01:08:37,833 --> 01:08:51,505
These are the symptoms which everyone has
already as a chronic condition which all have.

548
01:08:52,441 --> 01:09:00,033
Nobody of us today is really
healthy so we mix our own symptoms

549
01:09:01,130 --> 01:09:12,394
with the symptoms of the remedy. We put down
2000 symptoms as symptoms of the remedy.

550
01:09:13,377 --> 01:09:19,017
You may say yes but the remedy
did not have any symptoms?

551
01:09:19,306 --> 01:09:29,129
Of course the remedy has some symptoms but
these few symptoms of the remedy were mixed

552
01:09:30,433 --> 01:09:37,769
in 2000 symptoms which have
no relevance to the remedy.

553
01:09:46,425 --> 01:09:47,937
- I want to ask something.

554
01:09:48,232 --> 01:09:54,303
Has it ever been observed that a person
sensitive to a certain remedy of the proving

555
01:09:55,825 --> 01:10:04,545
will in the future develop some kind of condition
which responds to this particular remedy?

556
01:10:04,808 --> 01:10:06,031
- Yes.

557
01:10:07,055 --> 01:10:14,207
- He's sensitive to this remedy from the proving
but will he develop a disease in the future

558
01:10:14,464 --> 01:10:18,832
which responds to this remedy has
was sensitive to in the proving?

559
01:10:19,736 --> 01:10:26,775
- Yes but you have to be aware that in
the provings we don't have pathologies,

560
01:10:28,999 --> 01:10:39,792
we have response of the immune system,
functional symptoms which are not disease,

561
01:10:40,184 --> 01:10:52,136
that means you give a remedy, you
prove Carcinosin and whether

562
01:10:52,544 --> 01:10:54,320
the person can develop cancer...

563
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:58,623
- In the future he might
develop symptoms, pathology

564
01:10:58,919 --> 01:11:02,567
which responds to the remedy he
was sensitive to in the proving

565
01:11:02,952 --> 01:11:05,336
in which he has this
predisposition...

566
01:11:06,872 --> 01:11:08,648
- My answer is no.

567
01:11:09,176 --> 01:11:17,223
It may sometimes happen but Natrum muriaticum
what kind of pathology will develop?

568
01:11:18,503 --> 01:11:21,103
We don't know. It
can be anything.

569
01:11:22,135 --> 01:11:27,487
What kind of pathology Calcarea
carbonica may develop? Anything!

570
01:11:31,248 --> 01:11:40,377
From cancer to Parkinson's
disease, colitis, anything.

571
01:11:41,176 --> 01:11:53,248
The final pathology
belongs to all remedies.

572
01:11:53,543 --> 01:12:01,815
That means all remedies in their end
stages can have all kinds of pathology.

573
01:12:03,432 --> 01:12:18,288
That means the pathology that can be caused
by a remedy is never the end result.

574
01:12:19,256 --> 01:12:23,368
That means before a person
dies with a pathology,

575
01:12:23,759 --> 01:12:29,071
that kind of pathology cannot
be caused be a specific remedy,

576
01:12:30,736 --> 01:12:34,527
it's caused by the organism
himself and his predisposition.

577
01:12:38,224 --> 01:12:44,567
- I was wondering Hahnemann only says
that we have to find healthy individuals

578
01:12:44,823 --> 01:12:51,487
to give them to. That's why
they are trying in India...

579
01:12:53,248 --> 01:12:55,400
- I will speak about that.

580
01:12:57,424 --> 01:13:03,868
- I think I know that you have the idea to
give the remedy to sensitive persons only...

581
01:13:07,388 --> 01:13:11,756
- Later on I will tell you my idea
on the proving of the remedies.

582
01:13:12,212 --> 01:13:14,043
Just wait a moment.

583
01:13:16,259 --> 01:13:20,963
108."There is, therefore,
no other possible way

584
01:13:21,251 --> 01:13:25,923
in which the peculiar effects of
medicines on the health of individuals

585
01:13:26,588 --> 01:13:31,979
can be accurately ascertained
- there is no sure,

586
01:13:32,307 --> 01:13:36,323
no more natural way of
accomplishing this object,

587
01:13:37,299 --> 01:13:47,724
than to administer the several medicines
experimentally, in moderate doses..."

588
01:13:52,227 --> 01:13:55,243
This is the catch phrase.

589
01:13:56,411 --> 01:14:10,523
That means when you want to start an
experiment and if you want to have an effect,

590
01:14:12,107 --> 01:14:28,499
you can start with posology
which is sub-toxic.

591
01:14:32,187 --> 01:14:43,315
Not really toxic dose to kill the
person but sub-toxic. Moderate doses.

592
01:14:44,027 --> 01:15:06,787
In paragraph 35 he says that medicines
have a power bigger that disease.

593
01:15:07,755 --> 01:15:12,491
That means a disease can come to
you if you have a predisposition.

594
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:22,035
Medicines do not need you
to have a predisposition.

595
01:15:22,739 --> 01:15:33,859
If I gave you large enough doses I
can poison anyone with any remedy

596
01:15:35,059 --> 01:15:40,346
as long as I give it to you
in large enough doses.

597
01:16:03,833 --> 01:16:10,569
32nd. "But it is quite otherwise
with the artificial morbific agents

598
01:16:10,953 --> 01:16:12,769
which we term medicines"

599
01:16:15,034 --> 01:16:20,714
Before he says you have to have a
sensitivity towards a disease.

600
01:16:21,025 --> 01:16:28,265
Now he says it's "it is quite otherwise
with the artificial morbific agents

601
01:16:28,521 --> 01:16:29,889
which we term medicines.

602
01:16:30,442 --> 01:16:38,649
Every real medicine, namely, acts at
all times, under all circumstances,

603
01:16:39,641 --> 01:16:42,097
on every living human being,

604
01:16:42,793 --> 01:16:56,497
and produces in him its peculiar
symptoms (if the dose be large enough)"

605
01:16:59,089 --> 01:17:05,025
You see in which case you can do a proving? You
can do a proving if you have some individuals

606
01:17:05,978 --> 01:17:12,881
who agree to take in some
cases the mother tincture,

607
01:17:13,345 --> 01:17:21,481
in some other cases a little bit more
attenuated and when you take hydrocyanic acid

608
01:17:21,833 --> 01:17:34,841
try to attenuate enough so you
don't leave this world quite fast.

609
01:17:37,377 --> 01:17:45,914
But you have to find what is the
sub-toxic dose that can produce reaction

610
01:17:46,609 --> 01:17:48,185
from the organism.

611
01:17:58,618 --> 01:18:06,809
- When we make a proving with potentized
medicine and we need sensitive people

612
01:18:07,178 --> 01:18:11,017
for this medicine is
there any possibility...

613
01:18:11,513 --> 01:18:13,401
- Later on he will say that.

614
01:18:15,690 --> 01:18:23,639
Hahnemann has experimented
mostly in sub toxic doses.

615
01:18:23,926 --> 01:18:30,070
In his Materia Medica there are
toxic, sub-toxic and finally

616
01:18:32,982 --> 01:18:36,478
high potencies on
sensitive individuals.

617
01:18:36,967 --> 01:18:43,742
So all this will come together finally
to produce the array of symptoms

618
01:18:44,150 --> 01:18:45,870
that a remedy can produce.

619
01:18:46,686 --> 01:18:53,822
But you have to find which are sensitive
first to a particular remedy.

620
01:18:54,263 --> 01:19:01,814
And to find it when you start an
experiment and you give sub-toxic dose

621
01:19:02,470 --> 01:19:10,110
to the whole class and one of you
comes and say today I have a headache

622
01:19:10,678 --> 01:19:11,942
I never had in my life.

623
01:19:14,607 --> 01:19:17,742
Ok with the 2 doses you got
you already get a headache.

624
01:19:18,558 --> 01:19:22,550
You are a good subject for
proving a high potency

625
01:19:23,014 --> 01:19:31,086
all the rest will give you some symptoms
if they continue taking the remedy

626
01:19:32,183 --> 01:19:35,262
but these symptoms will
be gross symptoms.

627
01:19:35,758 --> 01:19:40,678
But the most subtle symptoms
will be given by the people

628
01:19:41,214 --> 01:19:47,910
who showed a specific sensitivity
to that specific drug.

629
01:19:50,087 --> 01:19:55,078
- It means that for instance a
proving of Lac defloratum, milk,

630
01:19:56,694 --> 01:20:04,558
all of us will drink a glass
of milk first and the person

631
01:20:04,919 --> 01:20:08,039
who will vomit just
by the smell of it...

632
01:20:10,510 --> 01:20:13,102
- This is the one
who is going to do.

633
01:20:13,718 --> 01:20:27,326
People who just drink one sip and vomit
will be the one to prove a high potency.

634
01:20:28,182 --> 01:20:34,238
- Could this person be considered as healthy
if there is such a big sensitivity?

635
01:20:34,894 --> 01:20:43,222
- He's not considered healthy but
on the other hand there is a way

636
01:20:43,670 --> 01:20:56,783
to get out of this by recording before
the experiment, at least for 1 month,

637
01:20:58,087 --> 01:21:01,926
every day, very carefully
all your symptoms.

638
01:21:03,326 --> 01:21:05,446
You write them in
a piece of paper.

639
01:21:07,278 --> 01:21:15,046
I wake up unrefreshed at 11
a.m., I need to eat something,

640
01:21:16,023 --> 01:21:25,159
they have to live in a particular way,
with the same kind of food, pure food,

641
01:21:25,486 --> 01:21:28,566
no alcohol, no stimulants...

642
01:21:29,974 --> 01:21:38,245
You write down all your symptoms
and once you have the full picture

643
01:21:39,358 --> 01:21:45,014
of your own symptoms so you
don't mix them with the remedy,

644
01:21:45,494 --> 01:21:49,654
so whatever beyond your
symptoms is recorded.

645
01:21:50,503 --> 01:22:00,095
If a symptom is eliminated, also is
recorded, but as secondary possibility.

646
01:22:00,934 --> 01:22:13,799
So if you have some new symptoms or symptoms
eliminated also recorded in separate group...

647
01:22:20,062 --> 01:22:30,198
You want to prove a remedy and by chance
one happens to be allergic to that

648
01:22:31,182 --> 01:22:37,262
that means it immediately brings out
a reaction then he's the best prover

649
01:22:37,622 --> 01:22:49,086
for a high potency. If he is very allergic to
this most probably he is going to be cured.

650
01:22:50,342 --> 01:22:53,782
It's going to be the
most similar remedy.

651
01:22:56,646 --> 01:23:04,886
- If you do provings with toxic substance
and you talk about subtoxic doses,

652
01:23:08,070 --> 01:23:10,006
variability in people...

653
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:24,734
- Every day you get 3 doses, 10-12-15
drops until you start feeling symptoms.

654
01:23:25,646 --> 01:23:27,454
This is the process.

655
01:23:28,246 --> 01:23:33,934
- You start from minute doses because the
toxicity is different to different people

656
01:23:34,262 --> 01:23:40,549
depending on liver functions, how he
reacts to the particular substances,

657
01:23:41,718 --> 01:23:46,318
the toxic level for someone may
differ from another person's...

658
01:23:46,694 --> 01:23:54,766
- I believe he will give some
rules for instance exclude those

659
01:23:55,007 --> 01:24:05,911
who are neurotics,
hysterics, hypochondriacs.

660
01:24:07,070 --> 01:24:11,615
Such people could not participate
in such an experiment.

661
01:24:14,591 --> 01:24:19,182
I don't remember if he writes
it but this is logical.

662
01:24:20,014 --> 01:24:24,542
Maybe be he will write it.
Do you remember if he writes it?

663
01:24:36,916 --> 01:24:41,572
- In Organon and you said it several
times over the years the real proving

664
01:24:42,205 --> 01:24:49,924
has to be carried out in really healthy
individuals. Today almost nobody is healthy.

665
01:24:50,332 --> 01:24:59,892
My question is; your final judgment, is
it worth trying making a proving today

666
01:25:00,228 --> 01:25:02,812
or is it useless?

667
01:25:03,740 --> 01:25:12,557
- What I have said in the past is...Boericke
Materia Medica has 780 remedies.

668
01:25:13,028 --> 01:25:18,107
Out of them more than
half are small remedies.

669
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:27,509
There is some information there and it will
be interesting to prove the small remedies

670
01:25:27,876 --> 01:25:36,277
to see if we can increase the symptomatology
which is there and is very little.

671
01:25:37,404 --> 01:25:47,389
That will be a good idea but the idea
has to be according to a protocol.

672
01:25:48,709 --> 01:25:58,885
And the protocol should be according to
what I have said starting with subtoxic,

673
01:26:00,676 --> 01:26:08,813
see the effect and the people
who are doing the experiment

674
01:26:09,349 --> 01:26:11,733
should not know
what the remedy is.

675
01:26:13,436 --> 01:26:23,445
Actually I should know the remedy
and give it to your group, try it

676
01:26:23,780 --> 01:26:31,924
and finally I will come down with a
conclusion how much of this is reliable

677
01:26:32,356 --> 01:26:39,388
and how much is most probably
due to fantasy, hysteria...

678
01:26:40,732 --> 01:26:46,067
- But it is not going to be again a combination
of the symptoms of the people as patients

679
01:26:46,348 --> 01:26:51,308
and those of the remedy... Because
they are not really healthy.

680
01:26:55,044 --> 01:27:01,348
- Before they start the experiment they have
to write down for a month all their symptoms.

681
01:27:01,741 --> 01:27:11,821
So they cannot bring a symptom that is
written. Unless they do that... forget it.

682
01:27:12,308 --> 01:27:17,524
In our state of health
it's impossible to get.

683
01:27:17,885 --> 01:27:22,876
Perhaps in India you can get
some healthy individuals.

684
01:27:24,972 --> 01:27:37,053
But the Indians have the problem
of not being systematic.

685
01:27:37,869 --> 01:27:47,204
They are enthusiastic but system
is not going together with India.

686
01:27:49,068 --> 01:27:57,540
They break the system very easily and they
get enthusiastic all cancers are cured!

687
01:27:58,860 --> 01:28:00,708
We cure all cancers!

688
01:28:01,108 --> 01:28:12,988
They get into this kind of enthusiasm due
to the fact they are very emotional people.

689
01:28:15,317 --> 01:28:22,772
We need moderation between people
who has some emotions also

690
01:28:23,580 --> 01:28:32,588
but some brains as well and control the brain,
control the emotions not to get overexcited.

691
01:28:38,228 --> 01:28:42,996
The provers should never
speak with one another.

692
01:28:46,309 --> 01:29:01,445
When I tried 2 times to do a proving I
failed. I could not get any symptoms.

693
01:29:05,996 --> 01:29:22,709
[Name] tried to prove Hydrogen. I said
how is it possible? It's volatile.

694
01:29:31,556 --> 01:29:34,260
I said how the hell
you have done it?

695
01:29:34,796 --> 01:29:41,747
I asked him to send me the
preparation he used for hydrogen

696
01:29:43,004 --> 01:29:49,885
and there was a group of Medical Doctors
in Italy who agreed to do the experiment

697
01:29:50,404 --> 01:29:54,916
with a remedy I would
give them, without knowing.

698
01:29:57,189 --> 01:30:05,192
So I gave it to them and of course they came
out with no effects. Nobody felt anything.

699
01:30:07,112 --> 01:30:12,840
They said now you have the obligation
to tell us what you gave us.

700
01:30:14,601 --> 01:30:17,097
I said I gave you hydrogen.

701
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:30,113
What? This is chemically not
possible to do pure hydrogen.

702
01:30:32,705 --> 01:30:39,424
But did not tell these people that I
had asked the hydrogen from Jeremy

703
01:30:40,048 --> 01:30:48,784
and he sent me the potencies and all that.
I lost these people completely.

704
01:30:49,785 --> 01:30:54,800
He said George knows no chemistry,
has no idea of what is going on,

705
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:02,736
he gave us hydrogen to prove.

706
01:31:03,616 --> 01:31:09,576
They were absolutely
irritated with the situation

707
01:31:10,024 --> 01:31:19,680
but I didn't want to criticize without
having some proof of what I was thinking.

708
01:31:21,601 --> 01:31:27,425
I sacrificed this group of medical doctors.
Because they did an effort.

709
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:31,008
I told them to write down
everything I tell you.

710
01:31:31,728 --> 01:31:38,320
And then I gave them hydrogen because
it was a big racket by that time.

711
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:59,848
- Is there any source of provings
you would recommend as reliable?

712
01:32:39,024 --> 01:32:45,152
- When I started, in the first group, I had a
case that I could not make out any remedy.

713
01:32:50,121 --> 01:32:58,720
And the man had great allergy and
feeling indifferent about life,

714
01:32:59,209 --> 01:33:09,337
just wanted to change world, go to the
next. Took lots of remedies, no effect.

715
01:33:10,417 --> 01:33:28,441
The only thing that ameliorated me
was the spores of black cumin oil.

716
01:33:38,072 --> 01:33:45,680
How did you find? I used to take
cakes that had these spores on top

717
01:33:46,257 --> 01:33:52,224
and whenever I took I found out that
this helped me a lot with my allergy.

718
01:33:56,688 --> 01:34:03,320
Why didn't you continue
taking cumin oil?

719
01:34:04,313 --> 01:34:12,248
Because I found out that as it went along
I needed more and more quantities,

720
01:34:13,832 --> 01:34:19,808
so I could not continue with such
big quantities of cumin oil.

721
01:34:21,553 --> 01:34:33,265
I said, we well do an experiment and I
will give you high potency of cumin oil.

722
01:34:35,345 --> 01:34:40,416
We tried to find out, I thought we don't
have it here, I ordered to prepare it,

723
01:34:41,137 --> 01:34:48,233
found out it was prepared in England
I said to buy it from England

724
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:56,457
and I am waiting for the effect. I
have written down all his case.

725
01:34:57,480 --> 01:35:08,569
I gave this high potency and if
this person is cured with cumin oil

726
01:35:09,969 --> 01:35:18,184
then we have the first information about the
symptomatology that cumin oil can produce,

727
01:35:19,201 --> 01:35:28,856
then eventually I can give it to others to see
whether they will develop similar symptoms.

728
01:35:29,953 --> 01:35:35,736
So this kind of starting a
proving is also very interesting

729
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:46,873
when somebody by chance gives a
remedy that nobody has proved

730
01:35:47,193 --> 01:35:58,801
but because of some thoughts that looks
like Rhus tox but it did not act

731
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:07,087
so I took another plant from this family,
gave it to him and he was cured.

732
01:36:07,968 --> 01:36:14,680
If there is such a case, I
accept that may be cured.

733
01:36:15,394 --> 01:36:21,889
And this is the beginning of a proving.
In this way we may have a remedy.
