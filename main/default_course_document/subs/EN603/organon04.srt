1
00:00:41,802 --> 00:01:01,303
109."I was the first that opened up this path,
which I have pursued with a perseverance

2
00:01:01,903 --> 00:01:10,604
that could only arise and be kept up by a
perfect conviction of the great truth,

3
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:17,801
fraught with such blessings
to humanity, that it is only

4
00:01:18,401 --> 00:01:21,103
by the homoeopathic
employment of medicines

5
00:01:21,402 --> 00:01:25,902
that the certain cure of
human maladies is possible."

6
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:45,103
You see how certain he is only
on that point we discuss before.

7
00:01:46,003 --> 00:01:57,403
Of course he mentions here another
German Albrecht von Haller

8
00:01:59,205 --> 00:02:10,002
who actually had said the same thing,
he was earlier than Hahnemann,

9
00:02:12,103 --> 00:02:16,903
that medicines should be
tested in healthy individuals.

10
00:02:23,503 --> 00:02:31,005
"I saw, moreover, that the morbid lesions
which previous authors had observed

11
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:37,903
to result from medicinal substances when
taken into the stomach of healthy persons,

12
00:02:39,403 --> 00:02:44,803
either in large doses
given by mistake

13
00:02:45,704 --> 00:02:51,103
or in order to produce death
in themselves or others"

14
00:02:53,500 --> 00:03:04,602
he has taken all the toxic effects from
suicides, people trying to kill each other

15
00:03:04,902 --> 00:03:11,503
by giving a certain substance and then
there were reports of these accidents.

16
00:03:12,103 --> 00:03:16,901
He says I have taken all "or
under other circumstances,

17
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:32,201
accorded very much with my own observations
when experimenting with the same substances

18
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:36,705
on myself and other
healthy individuals."

19
00:03:37,303 --> 00:03:51,402
What he did was he read the reports from
the toxic effects of the substances

20
00:03:52,302 --> 00:04:01,302
and then he took them himself and gave it
to his group as well in subtoxic doses

21
00:04:02,202 --> 00:04:11,802
and he says what they recorded in
their reports in the people poisoned

22
00:04:12,402 --> 00:04:25,602
by these substances are in
accordance to my observations

23
00:04:26,202 --> 00:04:34,003
when I took these medications
myself and the other doctors.

24
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:41,801
"These authors give details of what
occurred as histories of poisoning

25
00:04:42,402 --> 00:04:48,102
and as proofs of the pernicious
effects of these powerful substances,

26
00:04:48,703 --> 00:04:52,001
chiefly in order to warn
others from their use".

27
00:04:52,601 --> 00:04:59,800
These authors reported these effects to
prevent other from taking these drugs

28
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:03,100
in order not to be poisoned.

29
00:05:04,602 --> 00:05:09,104
"partly also for the sake of
exalting their own skill"

30
00:05:12,701 --> 00:05:17,801
they gave the report to prevent
others from taking the drugs

31
00:05:18,702 --> 00:05:29,503
but also they wanted to present their
own skills to the scientific community.

32
00:05:34,002 --> 00:05:39,701
He's very critical. He
leaves nothing out.

33
00:05:43,002 --> 00:05:51,103
"partly also for the sake of exalting their own
skill, when, under the use of the remedies

34
00:05:51,404 --> 00:05:58,904
they employed to combat these dangerous
accidents, health gradually returned;

35
00:06:00,404 --> 00:06:08,503
but partly also, when the persons so
affected died under their treatment,

36
00:06:09,105 --> 00:06:15,101
in order to seek their own justification in
the dangerous character of these substances"

37
00:06:16,003 --> 00:06:22,600
Partly they wanted to save these people
from death because they were treating them

38
00:06:23,503 --> 00:06:43,904
and of course some of them died and
then they named them poisonous.

39
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:51,104
It's the beginning
of the toxicology.

40
00:06:57,403 --> 00:07:05,801
He gives his opinion about the
doctors who have treated such cases

41
00:07:06,703 --> 00:07:12,702
and who gave reports of their
symptomatology before they die

42
00:07:13,002 --> 00:07:29,100
or when they tried to save them most probably
giving some very primitive drugs, herbs

43
00:07:31,805 --> 00:07:39,604
and finally if the people
who took the substance died

44
00:07:40,804 --> 00:07:48,003
then they termed these
substances poisonous.

45
00:07:55,205 --> 00:08:00,600
This is the beginning of the M.M.
as you all know.

46
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:08,405
"None of these observers ever
dreamed that the symptoms

47
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:15,301
they recorded merely as proofs of the noxious
and poisonous character of these substances

48
00:08:15,902 --> 00:08:21,003
were sure revelations of
the power of these drugs

49
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:29,401
to extinguish curatively similar
symptoms occurring in natural disease".

50
00:08:30,003 --> 00:08:41,401
They never imagined that these drugs
that were describing as symptoms

51
00:08:42,002 --> 00:08:57,002
could be the drugs that would save
life eventually. They did not suspect.

52
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:12,002
"these drugs to extinguish curatively similar
symptoms occurring in natural disease,

53
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:22,501
that these their pathogenetic phenomena were
intimations of their homoeopathic curative action,

54
00:09:23,702 --> 00:09:27,602
and that the only possible way to
ascertain their medicinal powers

55
00:09:28,205 --> 00:09:33,303
is to observe those changes of health
medicines are capable of producing

56
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,103
in the healthy organism".

57
00:09:36,902 --> 00:09:47,404
He repeats the same thing, these were the
possibilities through these symptoms

58
00:09:47,703 --> 00:09:51,002
they produce that will
cure such symptoms.

59
00:09:52,204 --> 00:09:57,604
"for the pure, peculiar powers of medicines
available for the cure of disease

60
00:09:57,904 --> 00:10:04,803
are to be learned neither by any ingenious
a priori speculations" This is important.

61
00:10:08,703 --> 00:10:22,804
For the pure, peculiar powers of
drugs which have the power to cure

62
00:10:24,003 --> 00:10:34,203
cannot be learned a
priori by speculations.

63
00:10:37,502 --> 00:10:45,301
Don't use your imagination
to say that this drug

64
00:10:45,904 --> 00:10:48,904
is going to produce
this and that symptom.

65
00:10:51,904 --> 00:11:00,003
There are some homeopaths who claim that
we don't have to prove the remedies.

66
00:11:00,304 --> 00:11:09,303
We just have to imagine and
they have written M.M.

67
00:11:11,403 --> 00:11:19,800
And they say this comes from the imagination
and just imagine what this remedy may do.

68
00:11:23,102 --> 00:11:32,701
Let us say I give you a remedy and I say
to you this is the remedy Radium bromatum

69
00:11:34,203 --> 00:11:44,703
so you hear Radium, radiation, bromatum
and I tell you can you imagine

70
00:11:46,203 --> 00:11:51,901
and write down for me what
symptoms could be produced.

71
00:11:52,203 --> 00:11:58,500
Even if you have some idea
what radiation can produce,

72
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,304
even then each one of you would
write a different story.

73
00:12:06,903 --> 00:12:14,403
You take all these different stories and
you make a M.M. of an imaginary remedy.

74
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:24,603
So he seems to have predicted
how crazy we could be.

75
00:12:31,204 --> 00:12:34,503
"and that the only possible way to
ascertain their medicinal powers

76
00:12:35,103 --> 00:12:42,301
is to observe those changes of health
medicines are capable of producing"

77
00:12:42,901 --> 00:12:50,700
this is the only way that you can
learn the action of the remedies.

78
00:12:55,501 --> 00:13:03,002
And he says something else
that you learn the drug

79
00:13:29,467 --> 00:13:31,866
"...for the pure, peculiar powers of [..]

80
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:40,266
[..] nor by the smell, taste or appearance of
the drugs, nor by their chemical analysis"

81
00:13:43,267 --> 00:13:46,765
which is done with conventional
medicine actually.

82
00:13:47,665 --> 00:13:57,564
"...nor yet by the employment of
several of them at one time

83
00:13:58,165 --> 00:14:09,564
in a mixture (prescription) in
diseases; it was never suspected

84
00:14:09,864 --> 00:14:13,168
that these histories
of medicinal diseases

85
00:14:13,764 --> 00:14:25,765
would one day furnish the first rudiments
of the true, pure Materia Medica,

86
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:35,066
which from the earliest times until now
has consisted solely of false conjectures

87
00:14:35,366 --> 00:14:38,191
and fictions of the imagination - that
is to say, did not exist at all."

88
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:53,191
He says that all the herbs that we have
been using so far in our medical practices

89
00:14:53,788 --> 00:14:59,490
are coming purely imaginations,
myths, tales, smells,

90
00:14:59,788 --> 00:15:05,488
because it smells like that you give this,
because it has that colour you give that,

91
00:15:06,091 --> 00:15:12,088
this was the type of medicine that was
practised during his time so he criticized it

92
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:19,592
and he said the only way to learn
the action of a drug is to prove it

93
00:15:19,891 --> 00:15:25,291
on healthy individuals. That is
the only way, there is no other.

94
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:30,692
No signatures, no
imagination, no nonsense.

95
00:15:35,788 --> 00:15:40,291
"The agreement of my observations
on the pure effects of medicines

96
00:15:40,888 --> 00:15:43,214
with these older ones - although
they were recorded without reference

97
00:15:45,018 --> 00:15:48,618
to any therapeutic object, - and the
very concordance of these accounts

98
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:54,016
with others of the same kind by different
authors must easily convince us

99
00:15:54,917 --> 00:16:00,918
that medicinal substances act in
the morbid changes they produce

100
00:16:01,515 --> 00:16:09,317
in the healthy human body according
to fixed, eternal laws of nature".

101
00:16:11,114 --> 00:16:16,216
I am convinced by these old
experiments that have been going on

102
00:16:17,118 --> 00:16:27,316
and by my own experience that these drugs
are curing people according to fixed,

103
00:16:27,915 --> 00:16:31,215
eternal laws of nature.

104
00:16:35,118 --> 00:16:41,414
"...and by virtue of these are
enabled to produce certain,

105
00:16:45,917 --> 00:16:57,014
reliable disease symptoms each according to its
own peculiar character." This is very simple.

106
00:17:01,815 --> 00:17:07,214
"In those older prescriptions of the
often dangerous effects of medicines

107
00:17:08,117 --> 00:17:16,216
ingested in excessively large doses we
notice certain states that were produced,

108
00:17:16,816 --> 00:17:23,115
not at the commencement, but towards
the termination of these sad events,

109
00:17:23,414 --> 00:17:28,216
and which were of an exactly opposite
nature to those that first appeared"

110
00:17:28,816 --> 00:17:37,816
I'll read it all and then I will explain
you what it means in my own words

111
00:17:39,014 --> 00:17:43,815
but if somebody claims that he understands
this paragraph please tell me.

112
00:17:48,017 --> 00:17:52,218
"These symptoms, the very reverse
of the primary action (par. 63)

113
00:17:52,515 --> 00:17:57,316
or proper action of the medicines on the vital
force are the reaction of the vital force

114
00:17:57,617 --> 00:18:02,414
of the organism, its
secondary action (par.par. 62-67),

115
00:18:03,017 --> 00:18:08,116
of which, however, there is seldom or hardly
ever the least trace from experiments

116
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:14,115
with moderate doses on healthy bodies,
and from small doses none whatever.

117
00:18:14,716 --> 00:18:19,516
In the homoeopathic curative operation
the living organism reacts from these

118
00:18:19,816 --> 00:18:27,017
only so much as is requisite to raise the health
again to the normal healthy state (par. 67)."

119
00:18:27,617 --> 00:18:32,417
If anybody understands
this... you tell me.

120
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:43,816
- Here Dr.Hahnemann claims about the primary
action and the secondary action of the drug.

121
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:49,513
He said as explained in the
previous aphorism that a medicine

122
00:18:51,016 --> 00:18:57,016
mostly given in higher doses as a poison
or for proving a drug the patient

123
00:18:57,317 --> 00:18:59,115
used to get symptoms
of the medicines...

124
00:18:59,717 --> 00:19:04,816
- No, don't get excited. Speak slowly
so we can understand what you are say.

125
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:11,413
You speak slowly
very good like this.

126
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:18,315
- Here Dr.Hahnemann wants to explain about the
primary and secondary action of the drug.

127
00:19:21,015 --> 00:19:30,016
As he says in the aphorism 110 (the
previous one which you have explained)

128
00:19:30,616 --> 00:19:36,315
about the high doses of drugs that people
used to take and got poisonous effects

129
00:19:37,516 --> 00:19:42,315
he said those effects were the
primary action of those poisons.

130
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:57,016
- You explain it and then I will ask
the class if anybody has understood...

131
00:20:01,516 --> 00:20:09,616
I will need a second opinion.

132
00:20:10,813 --> 00:20:14,413
- When the poisons were
taken by the people,

133
00:20:15,316 --> 00:20:19,516
or were given to the physicians
the effect that people

134
00:20:19,816 --> 00:20:23,716
used to get is the primary
effect which everyone noted.

135
00:20:24,315 --> 00:20:29,115
But at the majority of those cases
there were certain symptoms

136
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:34,216
which all the people ignored they
are actually the secondary reaction

137
00:20:35,115 --> 00:20:42,013
which is the reaction of vital force.This is
very important for us homeopathic physicians

138
00:20:42,913 --> 00:20:47,716
because primary action is of the medicine,
a poison which the person takes

139
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:51,616
and secondary reaction is the
reaction of the vital force.

140
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:03,017
I can explain it on the board.
- Come.

141
00:21:16,018 --> 00:21:31,614
- In aphorism 101 we have learned
about the poisonous large doses.

142
00:21:34,613 --> 00:21:45,113
Then when give it to the people,
people die and show many symptoms.

143
00:21:46,017 --> 00:21:54,113
So Hahnemann has said these symptoms were
the primary action of these large doses.

144
00:21:54,714 --> 00:22:01,618
For example if a person was given
acetic acid he had poisoned himself

145
00:22:01,914 --> 00:22:05,818
with acetic acid and he got a set
of symptoms in the hospital.

146
00:22:06,413 --> 00:22:12,114
He termed them as primary action.
But after the termination of this...

147
00:22:12,714 --> 00:22:16,918
- The symptoms from which
he died are primary action?

148
00:22:17,513 --> 00:22:19,014
- Primary action.

149
00:22:19,316 --> 00:22:24,113
After acetic acid he got severe vomiting,
nausea, it is the primary action

150
00:22:25,613 --> 00:22:30,417
and then after the termination of this
illness, after taking the high doses,

151
00:22:31,014 --> 00:22:40,613
the persons get some symptoms at the
termination which were ignored by them,

152
00:22:43,314 --> 00:22:46,913
the physicians, but he
said these symptoms

153
00:22:47,815 --> 00:22:53,515
which they got after the termination of
this poisoning are the secondary action

154
00:22:55,018 --> 00:22:59,218
of the poison. Because it is a
reaction of the vital force.

155
00:22:59,814 --> 00:23:04,013
For example a person took the
poisoning, he got burning sensation

156
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:10,317
and it is the primary action and the reaction
of the vital force to the burns is vomiting.

157
00:23:11,513 --> 00:23:13,316
Irritation of the throat.

158
00:23:13,915 --> 00:23:22,613
So these are the heritage of the M.M.
what actually we put in M.M.

159
00:23:22,917 --> 00:23:28,018
the reaction of the vital force.
- Good.

160
00:23:37,217 --> 00:23:39,799
Did anybody understand? We
have to make it clearer.

161
00:23:40,699 --> 00:23:41,599
- One last chance.

162
00:23:48,501 --> 00:23:53,601
As we learned in aphorism 101 about
the poisoning with large doses

163
00:23:54,201 --> 00:23:56,900
which you have explained
in this aphorism.

164
00:23:58,399 --> 00:24:04,999
This is primary action of the poison
and a person for example is poisoned

165
00:24:05,304 --> 00:24:17,301
with acetic acid so the reaction of the
body is vomiting, low blood pressure,

166
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,601
and nausea.

167
00:24:20,901 --> 00:24:26,601
This is action of the acetic acid
which he termed as primary action.

168
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:35,001
But when the large doses went
into the body the vital force

169
00:24:35,301 --> 00:24:43,399
started reacting because if he has taken
something the vital force reacts to it

170
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:48,503
and then produces a certain set
of symptoms which he termed

171
00:24:49,104 --> 00:24:56,300
as secondary reaction of the vital force
which is actually symptoms of M.M.,

172
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,401
which we should put in the M.M.

173
00:24:59,001 --> 00:25:03,800
and which help in knowing
the chemical drug ad hoc.

174
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:21,799
- I'll try to explain
what Hahnemann means.

175
00:25:22,402 --> 00:25:24,199
Anything in excess is a poison.

176
00:25:25,102 --> 00:25:28,099
Suppose table salt,
which we use daily.

177
00:25:28,703 --> 00:25:32,600
But the normal quantity of table
salt does not produce symptoms.

178
00:25:32,901 --> 00:25:39,200
But if we take a large quantity of table salt
we will be able to develop some symptoms

179
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:45,501
which if carefully recorded can
be used for curative purpose.

180
00:25:46,102 --> 00:25:53,600
Now the aphorism says the older prescriptions
of the often dangerous effects of medicines,

181
00:25:54,199 --> 00:25:56,899
this means those medicine which has
been taken in large forms initially

182
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:03,800
there is not any major kind of symptoms but
more dangerous symptoms are noticed in the end.

183
00:26:04,401 --> 00:26:08,900
So primary action will be that
effect of the drug on vital

184
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:13,103
and the secondary action will be the
effect of the vital force on the drug.

185
00:26:14,601 --> 00:26:21,500
By this if we risk to produce a
disease state in an individual,

186
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:31,703
we need to give a small dose of the
homeopathic medicine in order to is requisite

187
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,300
to raise the health again to
the normal healthy state.

188
00:26:35,899 --> 00:26:40,700
This aphorism means primary action
and secondary curative action.

189
00:26:53,899 --> 00:27:03,901
- This is something which I have
understood in a much simpler way.

190
00:27:11,701 --> 00:27:27,003
When anything is inserted in
the body which has an effect

191
00:27:27,602 --> 00:27:39,002
which is not normal like milk, bread,
there is no particular reaction,

192
00:27:39,601 --> 00:27:45,601
but if you insert in your body
which your body does not accept

193
00:27:48,301 --> 00:27:52,803
then your body is going
to have a reaction.

194
00:27:53,701 --> 00:28:03,601
The first reaction that the body will
have will be the primary symptoms

195
00:28:04,202 --> 00:28:08,100
which you can note down.

196
00:28:11,102 --> 00:28:22,501
The beginning of the reaction,
for instance in a poisoning,

197
00:28:24,601 --> 00:28:34,202
will give you some symptoms
which may be functional.

198
00:28:36,303 --> 00:28:53,701
If this poisoning continues to affect the
body eventually it will produce symptoms

199
00:28:54,001 --> 00:29:04,801
which the body will try to eliminate
the poisoning by a reaction

200
00:29:05,101 --> 00:29:11,102
which can be such as
even to bring death.

201
00:29:11,401 --> 00:29:20,102
That means the symptoms which
we should use for the M.M.

202
00:29:20,401 --> 00:29:42,002
and for practical purposes are the primary
reaction. The functional symptoms.

203
00:29:44,401 --> 00:29:53,701
All poisonous substance if
given in a very big quantity,

204
00:29:54,599 --> 00:30:03,901
in the beginning they will have
particular symptoms but in the end

205
00:30:04,501 --> 00:30:07,501
will all have the
same pathology.

206
00:30:08,999 --> 00:30:20,401
That means all substances can
create pathological structures

207
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:31,200
which are will be considered as secondary
and which could not be used by us

208
00:30:32,099 --> 00:30:37,201
in choosing the remedy. We cannot
choose the remedy on the pathology.

209
00:30:37,501 --> 00:30:38,401
This is the idea.

210
00:30:38,999 --> 00:30:48,301
A poison in small doses can
create a few symptoms.

211
00:30:50,399 --> 00:31:01,199
If you keep on giving the poison the organism
is going to be more and more subdued

212
00:31:01,804 --> 00:31:12,802
and eventually create a
pathological condition

213
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:17,602
which is going to be
quite deep and serious.

214
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:27,800
That kind of pathology can be created
by any substance that can be given once

215
00:31:28,103 --> 00:31:34,101
it is in large doses.

216
00:31:41,002 --> 00:31:53,040
What we have to understand is
that the remedy produces symptoms

217
00:31:53,341 --> 00:31:59,641
which are useful for us
not in their end stages

218
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:05,042
when they bring the
organism towards death.

219
00:32:06,544 --> 00:32:16,741
These symptoms are not useful for us
because all substances will bring death

220
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,741
by certain pathology.

221
00:32:21,241 --> 00:32:32,941
They will have a diarrhea which will
cause bleeding and the person will die.

222
00:32:34,741 --> 00:32:36,841
This is not useful.

223
00:32:37,444 --> 00:32:42,243
What is useful is the primary
reaction of the organism.

224
00:32:51,242 --> 00:32:53,343
I'll give you another example.

225
00:32:58,744 --> 00:33:11,042
You get an influenza and it is a substance
which produces a reaction from the organism.

226
00:33:15,844 --> 00:33:20,944
You have headaches,
muscle pains etc.

227
00:33:22,741 --> 00:33:34,141
But the organism is not able to counteract
through this symptomatology and cure influenza.

228
00:33:35,344 --> 00:33:45,244
So influenza proceeds, that means the
workings of the substance proceeds

229
00:33:45,542 --> 00:33:48,544
and goes deeper to the organism.

230
00:33:58,744 --> 00:34:11,942
There is a point where the body gives up
and the pathology becomes irreversible.

231
00:34:17,344 --> 00:34:28,144
This reaction of the organism can be
considered as a secondary reaction

232
00:34:31,441 --> 00:34:37,440
as long as the poison or
the disease is severe.

233
00:34:39,842 --> 00:34:48,544
You can imagine an influenza
becoming a bronchitis, a pneumonia

234
00:34:49,444 --> 00:34:59,643
and at a certain time the organism is not
able to counteract the pneumonia anymore

235
00:35:00,242 --> 00:35:06,244
and the lungs are filling
quickly with liquid.

236
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:32,642
That is a reaction which can be considered as
a giving-up but still there is a reaction.

237
00:35:33,841 --> 00:35:42,245
There is still liquid which
is flowing into the lungs.

238
00:35:43,743 --> 00:35:51,843
That reaction which has come about
because the inflammation of the lungs

239
00:35:53,041 --> 00:36:00,243
has become more and more and
there is a flow of liquid,

240
00:36:01,445 --> 00:36:10,743
there is a time where the organism gives
up but still continues to have a reaction,

241
00:36:11,341 --> 00:36:18,840
producing more and more flow, producing
a pathology which is leading to death.

242
00:36:23,942 --> 00:36:29,042
This secondary reaction
which is a reaction

243
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:43,741
which came after a long struggle of the
organism, is not useful for Homeopathy.

244
00:36:46,141 --> 00:36:54,541
That means that all poisonous substances
are going to have the same end,

245
00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:04,741
the death of the patient
but there is a point until

246
00:37:05,042 --> 00:37:12,844
which there is a possibility for recovery,
the organism is producing symptoms

247
00:37:13,143 --> 00:37:19,741
and tell you I have this and that, save
me, through the symptoms I give you.

248
00:37:21,543 --> 00:37:32,042
Until a time he gives up and says I'm
in coma or filled up with liquid

249
00:37:32,643 --> 00:37:33,842
and it's finished.

250
00:37:34,741 --> 00:37:45,243
That portion, from the portion of the
giving up of the organism further down

251
00:37:46,445 --> 00:37:56,645
is not a useful information
for the homeopathic remedy.

252
00:37:56,941 --> 00:38:08,044
You cannot say this homeopathic drug
can produce ulcerative colitis.

253
00:38:09,541 --> 00:38:19,441
All drugs can produce ulcerative
colitis if given in big dose.

254
00:38:20,344 --> 00:38:29,642
Therefore you cannot say this
drug is going to produce U.C.

255
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:43,744
which is dangerous for life
because the organism has given up

256
00:38:44,041 --> 00:38:59,040
at certain moment the fight. I still
see some eyes which are not clear.

257
00:39:03,244 --> 00:39:07,443
We have 2 stages.

258
00:39:08,042 --> 00:39:14,042
One is with homeopathic remedies
and their proving symptoms.

259
00:39:16,141 --> 00:39:18,245
The other we have the pathology.

260
00:39:22,141 --> 00:39:38,344
Both the pathology can reach a very severe
state in which the person goes to death,

261
00:39:39,845 --> 00:39:49,744
on the other hand the remedy if given
in big doses can finally reach a state

262
00:39:50,641 --> 00:39:54,244
in which the organism
gives up and dies.

263
00:39:55,444 --> 00:40:14,042
This end-stages, that means before the
turning point, the information is useful.

264
00:40:15,541 --> 00:40:21,544
After the turning point the
information is useless.

265
00:40:23,941 --> 00:40:32,042
What is the turning point in
pathology...is when there is no hope

266
00:40:32,641 --> 00:40:34,141
and the person will die.

267
00:40:36,841 --> 00:40:44,341
Why the person dies? For only one reason,
because the organism is not able to cope

268
00:40:46,442 --> 00:40:56,341
with the pathology which has been created
by the disease or by the medicine.

269
00:40:58,141 --> 00:41:06,245
There is a time when the pathology
cannot be dealt by the organism,

270
00:41:07,144 --> 00:41:15,840
cannot be fought by the
defence mechanism.

271
00:41:20,941 --> 00:41:29,042
I want you to see that point because there
is a lot of discussion about this matter.

272
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,741
Then I will tell you
a few more things.

273
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:41,343
Because Hahnemann was
not very clear himself

274
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:59,941
because when you give opium to somebody the
original reaction is to create diarrhea

275
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:13,443
but after the diarrhea a
secondary state is constipation.

276
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:29,640
So this is something that has given a
kind of confusion in this paragraph

277
00:42:31,441 --> 00:42:47,040
because if the remedy is not poisonous
to the extent that will kill the patient

278
00:42:48,843 --> 00:42:56,040
he may start with one set of symptoms
and then go to another set of symptoms.

279
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,442
But still the
organism is reacting.

280
00:43:00,642 --> 00:43:08,744
If the poisoning is too much there
is a pushing up to a certain point

281
00:43:09,641 --> 00:43:14,443
the organism fights then
the organism gives up.

282
00:43:19,844 --> 00:43:30,042
Which of the 2 is ... what
Hahnemann means is not clear.

283
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:38,444
That is why it has been
in such a confusion.

284
00:43:38,742 --> 00:43:48,643
You have to understand all diseases
end in the same pathology.

285
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:59,143
All poisonous substances end
in the same pathologies.

286
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:12,944
End stages can be created
by disease or by medicine.

287
00:44:14,141 --> 00:44:21,643
But these end stages which are the
final pathology which a person dies from

288
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:28,844
 is similar to all
diseases and to all remedies.

289
00:44:29,445 --> 00:44:32,141
There is no
individualization any more.

290
00:44:33,645 --> 00:44:38,145
There is no reaction of
the organism any more.

291
00:44:38,445 --> 00:44:45,643
The organism gives up, so there
is no individualization.

292
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:52,845
It is going to die with certain
pathologies which exist.

293
00:45:01,543 --> 00:45:03,344
Somebody wants to speak.

294
00:45:05,142 --> 00:45:06,341
German.

295
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,942
- I don't think that he is
really talking about the fact

296
00:45:16,543 --> 00:45:20,140
that when the organism comes to a
point where he can't react anymore

297
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:27,941
that there is a turning point it
is definitely going to death.

298
00:45:28,844 --> 00:45:34,241
Of course every poisoning
can produce every symptom

299
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:38,440
but some poisons are more prone
to produce certain symptoms

300
00:45:38,742 --> 00:45:40,542
that someone will rely on.

301
00:45:41,744 --> 00:45:44,743
Concerning the Opium it
is the other way round.

302
00:45:49,841 --> 00:45:55,241
The first reaction of the
organism to the example of Opium...

303
00:45:55,543 --> 00:45:57,342
- Let me repeat.

304
00:45:57,943 --> 00:46:02,440
Whether it is primary or secondary
reaction as long as the organism

305
00:46:03,642 --> 00:46:08,742
is able to react, it's useful.

306
00:46:16,241 --> 00:46:28,241
If the poisoning is too
much the person will die.

307
00:46:28,542 --> 00:46:36,043
If the pathology is very
severe the person will die.

308
00:46:50,142 --> 00:46:53,444
We are not interested in differentiating
between primary and secondary reaction.

309
00:46:53,743 --> 00:47:00,340
What we are interested in only
is to know that at this moment

310
00:47:01,241 --> 00:47:06,943
there is no hope anymore because
the organism does not react,

311
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:12,345
doesn't give symptoms anymore.

312
00:47:27,341 --> 00:47:31,840
- If I understand this correctly
this point of no return is

313
00:47:32,142 --> 00:47:36,042
when the organism is left
alone to fight the disease

314
00:47:36,643 --> 00:47:40,542
so he can compensate the
symptoms up to this point

315
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:46,540
and when he reaches this point he cannot
compensate anymore but still reacts.

316
00:47:47,743 --> 00:47:52,542
Is it true that if we come to this
point after the point of no return

317
00:47:52,840 --> 00:48:01,541
with the right homeopathic remedy
there is no chance to go back?

318
00:48:01,842 --> 00:48:07,542
- No. Something you
don't understand.

319
00:48:10,541 --> 00:48:13,840
You remember I told you about a
man who was 3 months is a coma,

320
00:48:14,442 --> 00:48:21,640
I went and said forget it he's gone
out of the possibility of Homeopathy.

321
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:30,344
Then I said ok since you are my
friends I am going to see him

322
00:48:30,643 --> 00:48:40,542
and when I saw him I said I saw some signs
which indicated for me a remedy as a reaction.

323
00:48:42,643 --> 00:48:46,241
And so therefore I felt here
there is a possibility.

324
00:49:00,941 --> 00:49:14,440
On another occasion when I was
treating a rabbi in America in a coma.

325
00:49:17,141 --> 00:49:24,941
I went there. I saw some
signs he could still react.

326
00:49:26,141 --> 00:49:28,543
I gave the remedy
and lived 2 years.

327
00:49:29,142 --> 00:49:36,941
At the age of 94 they called me from
America and they give me symptoms.

328
00:49:38,741 --> 00:49:42,642
They said he was in an operating
room for his gallbladder

329
00:49:43,541 --> 00:49:51,944
and he had his gallbladder out and he
fell into coma again, please come.

330
00:49:54,944 --> 00:50:04,840
I said what are the symptoms? No symptoms.
I said I cannot come there is no reason.

331
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,542
They said please
come, I don't come.

332
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:13,542
They called again, I said ok then call
one of my students Roger Morrison

333
00:50:14,442 --> 00:50:17,740
and tell him to come there
to give me the symptoms.

334
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:25,541
Roger Morrison goes there and calls me
and says George it's a matter of 2 days,

335
00:50:26,442 --> 00:50:31,542
he will die. No symptoms. This
is the point of no return.

336
00:50:32,141 --> 00:50:35,742
The first case he was
in coma there were symptoms.

337
00:50:36,042 --> 00:50:40,543
The second time he is in coma
there are no symptoms, forget it.

338
00:50:42,643 --> 00:50:49,241
You do not get the severity of the disease
of the disease by the name of it.

339
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:58,541
There are still reaction
from the organism.

340
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:05,140
- But you said that after the point
of no return the organism gives up

341
00:51:05,742 --> 00:51:10,840
but still produces symptoms
which are not effective.

342
00:51:11,741 --> 00:51:16,241
So there are still symptoms but the
organism cannot cope by itself.

343
00:51:22,241 --> 00:51:31,840
- It depends. To have one symptom
which is coma is not good enough.

344
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:47,440
I told you I have been in the emergency
room with a woman who was operated

345
00:51:48,643 --> 00:51:52,840
and I saw the woman
and I saw some signs.

346
00:51:56,145 --> 00:52:09,643
And the surgeon who was very well known
and a professor of surgery said to me

347
00:52:10,244 --> 00:52:18,340
what can you do in such a case?
I said yes.

348
00:52:19,543 --> 00:52:22,844
What will you do? I said I will
not tell you what I will do

349
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:29,741
but I will tell you what you must not do.
Stop all the medication and then I will see.

350
00:52:40,845 --> 00:52:45,042
All the Greek doctors know him.

351
00:52:48,941 --> 00:52:55,845
I said to him do you still have hopes
that you will bring back this patient?

352
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:00,645
Because he operated this patient.
He was the responsible.

353
00:53:01,543 --> 00:53:06,043
He said yes we have not
lost hope, I said goodbye.

354
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:12,644
If you say that you can bring back this
patient you don't need me. Bye bye.

355
00:53:15,043 --> 00:53:21,643
After a few days he calls
me and says ok you come.

356
00:53:22,542 --> 00:53:27,943
Now what must I do? Just
disappear you and your doctors,

357
00:53:28,843 --> 00:53:37,543
take out all medications and
leave the patient to my care.

358
00:53:40,241 --> 00:53:48,943
The head of the emergency was there
and he was asking different questions

359
00:53:49,241 --> 00:53:51,941
what you are going to give,
we have to write it down,

360
00:53:53,142 --> 00:53:55,543
this is the remedy I am going
to give, write it down.

361
00:54:03,043 --> 00:54:11,143
I expect that she will slowly get out of the
coma, I expect that she will raise fever,

362
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:18,644
perhaps a high fever but you are not
supposed to give antibiotics or cortisone.

363
00:54:24,641 --> 00:54:25,841
He said ok.

364
00:54:26,144 --> 00:54:30,343
He said how are you going to give
the medication since she is coma?

365
00:54:37,845 --> 00:54:48,043
I will have some water and cotton and the
nurse will put the cotton in the water

366
00:54:50,142 --> 00:55:00,941
and put it in her mouth. He jumped
up and he said you don't tell me

367
00:55:01,542 --> 00:55:12,644
that I studied for 10 years to
be a specialist in the I.U.

368
00:55:13,243 --> 00:55:16,443
and now you tell me you come
with cotton to give the medicine

369
00:55:17,341 --> 00:55:23,040
and the patient will come back.
He was out of his mind.

370
00:55:29,942 --> 00:55:35,643
Never mind, the big boss said I should
take care this is what I have to do.

371
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:45,541
They started giving the water and
in the night at about 1 a.m.

372
00:55:48,539 --> 00:55:59,940
the fever was raised to 39 C
and the son of this woman

373
00:56:01,142 --> 00:56:05,639
who loved her very much and
I have told him in the I.U.

374
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:12,242
where everybody is in coma, they will
allow me to come and resurrect a patient

375
00:56:12,544 --> 00:56:13,577
who is dying?

376
00:56:34,642 --> 00:56:40,639
It was Christmas Eve at 1 a.m.
and I was awake.

377
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:48,141
He calls me and says the nurse
is going now to give antibiotics

378
00:56:48,741 --> 00:56:52,941
because my mother
has fever 39 C.

379
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:07,341
I am 40km away from the place, even
if I was closer I could do nothing,

380
00:57:08,239 --> 00:57:17,239
the nurse had decided to go and the man
who was sitting next to the mother,

381
00:57:17,541 --> 00:57:22,042
he said to the nurse where are you going?
I have to give injections.

382
00:57:22,341 --> 00:57:27,140
What injections? Cortisone
with antibiotics.

383
00:57:29,541 --> 00:57:43,341
In the meantime she had unbelievable stool
and she started coming out of the coma,

384
00:57:43,941 --> 00:57:45,139
moving hands.

385
00:57:46,942 --> 00:57:53,842
It was from the morning they started the
remedy till 1 a.m. that this happened.

386
00:57:55,641 --> 00:58:06,444
And they give the antibiotics. And of course
the next day she goes back into coma.

387
00:58:08,542 --> 00:58:16,341
And Roger Morrison was studying with
me in Athens, he studied in I.U.

388
00:58:16,942 --> 00:58:19,042
and I told him to go together.

389
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:33,443
The big professor came with
his 10 doctors following him

390
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:45,142
and I said to him we had agreed that you
don't give antibiotics and cortisone.

391
00:58:48,141 --> 00:58:55,341
The head of the I.U. gave an order
to the nurse to give antibiotics

392
00:58:55,639 --> 00:58:59,542
and the patient is back in coma.

393
00:59:04,639 --> 00:59:10,041
He said well there was a misunderstanding
he tried to excuse himself

394
00:59:11,539 --> 00:59:16,640
I didn't want to continue but
he pressurized me a lot.

395
00:59:17,243 --> 00:59:21,439
He said try again. I
said ok, I'll try again.

396
00:59:22,941 --> 00:59:31,039
The same scenario exactly.
They started 12 a.m.

397
00:59:31,941 --> 00:59:38,239
The fever was high the nurse went there,
she gave antibiotics. Back to coma.

398
00:59:40,041 --> 00:59:45,440
I went back and I said sir I
am sorry I leave the case.

399
00:59:48,139 --> 00:59:49,941
So she died after a few days.

400
00:59:53,539 --> 00:59:57,440
This case was still reacting.

401
00:59:59,239 --> 01:00:01,041
We still have some information.

402
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:06,439
But the 3rd time there was
no information anymore.

403
01:00:11,844 --> 01:00:15,742
There was no sign of anything I
could base my prescription on.

404
01:00:21,439 --> 01:00:30,744
I believe that Hahnemann did not have a
clear picture of what we are facing today.

405
01:00:31,341 --> 01:00:34,341
Today we are facing
these situations.

406
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:42,141
One situation is that the organism
can react to the medicine

407
01:00:42,439 --> 01:00:55,341
or to the disease or the constant changes
within the body may bring the body

408
01:00:55,642 --> 01:01:07,039
to a state where there is no return.
After this red line we can do nothing.

409
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:13,942
- About this red line.

410
01:01:14,242 --> 01:01:23,542
I work in emergency for pets and
the patients arrive too late

411
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:28,339
and there is a point of no return,
there is nothing that we can do

412
01:01:28,639 --> 01:01:31,942
because with Homeopathy they
die fast and without agony

413
01:01:32,841 --> 01:01:48,740
and very often they die calmly with
no pain. It makes death easier.

414
01:01:50,839 --> 01:02:00,744
- That is correct. Once they have passed the
red line the remedy will speed up the death.

415
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:08,843
The remedy will sooth the situation,
it will make it more calm.

416
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:30,740
In a case where there is no return,
all people who die from metastases,

417
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:48,143
they die with pain, agony, the homeopathic
remedy will sooth the suffering

418
01:02:49,041 --> 01:03:04,943
but will speed up death. That's why we
never base our prescriptions on pathology.

419
01:03:09,441 --> 01:03:14,539
It's almost useless. Very few
times you may strike the remedy.

420
01:03:18,439 --> 01:03:28,339
What you need is primary
or secondary symptoms.

421
01:03:28,941 --> 01:03:35,239
As long as the organism is reacting it's
ok, you take them into consideration.

422
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:41,842
But once this is gone
they are useless.

423
01:03:45,439 --> 01:03:48,741
Whether you want to call
them secondary or whatever.

424
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:57,440
But my understanding is
what I am explaining.

425
01:04:03,744 --> 01:04:20,839
You will see later that the symptoms
which are created by a remedy

426
01:04:29,842 --> 01:04:44,539
can be opposing each other like the pendulum,
push the organism towards one side

427
01:04:45,144 --> 01:04:50,239
then the organism goes to the other side
then the organism is in a good condition.

428
01:04:52,644 --> 01:05:06,741
You make an organism which is very
cold, very hot and then will balance.

429
01:05:09,143 --> 01:05:20,844
This information about the remedy is the
bipolar information from the remedies.

430
01:05:21,441 --> 01:05:29,542
A remedy can be very cold
primarily but very hot also.

431
01:05:32,541 --> 01:05:37,343
If you like to call it primary and
secondary symptoms you may do it

432
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:39,142
but still they are
useful symptoms

433
01:05:40,342 --> 01:05:50,242
but the moment the pathology progresses beyond
the redline then the symptoms are useless.

434
01:05:51,744 --> 01:05:52,941
You cannot use them.

435
01:05:59,241 --> 01:06:05,542
Pulsatilla is very hot but
sometimes is quite chilly.

436
01:06:07,341 --> 01:06:17,843
Arsenicum is quite cold remedy but
sometimes is either normal or hot.

437
01:06:20,241 --> 01:06:23,985
There are primary and
secondary symptoms.

438
01:06:24,287 --> 01:06:30,887
We call primary symptom for Pulsatilla
is heat the secondary is the coldness

439
01:06:32,387 --> 01:06:36,888
but still has no special
importance for us.

440
01:06:38,683 --> 01:06:43,786
These are symptoms that can
be used in prescribing.

441
01:06:55,186 --> 01:07:02,985
We have bipolar symptoms of
many remedies and most probably

442
01:07:03,585 --> 01:07:08,083
we don't know all the opposing
symptoms we may have.

443
01:07:09,584 --> 01:07:14,386
Almost all remedies
have bipolar symptoms.

444
01:07:14,983 --> 01:07:17,083
Natrum muriaticum has
desire for salt.

445
01:07:17,537 --> 01:07:21,738
This is the primary reaction and the aversion
to salt can be called secondary reaction.

446
01:07:28,034 --> 01:07:34,334
Ignatia has aversion to fruits but
has desire for fruits as well.

447
01:07:39,734 --> 01:07:46,035
Hahnemann was trying to put this in
an order by giving this information.

448
01:07:47,836 --> 01:07:55,937
He did not have the information that
we have today with all the pathologies

449
01:07:56,833 --> 01:08:03,734
that are developing and
terrible situations.

450
01:08:11,233 --> 01:08:15,736
- If I understood right, and please correct
me, concerning this point of no return,

451
01:08:18,137 --> 01:08:27,434
before the redline the state belongs
to the 4th group but is very severe,

452
01:08:27,737 --> 01:08:31,633
a few symptoms are presented,
one can prescribe a remedy,

453
01:08:32,533 --> 01:08:37,936
see a slight aggravation have a next
picture and then maybe we have a chance.

454
01:08:39,436 --> 01:08:44,236
Beyond the redline in the same 4th
group there are some symptoms

455
01:08:45,136 --> 01:08:48,733
we give a remedy and you get a slight
amelioration, the case is lost.

456
01:08:51,433 --> 01:08:52,934
- That is correct.

457
01:09:00,433 --> 01:09:01,937
- I read an article recently.

458
01:09:02,836 --> 01:09:06,134
There is a new branch of
medicine where they find

459
01:09:06,436 --> 01:09:12,436
that dead people are not really dead and they
work for hours and hours develop technics

460
01:09:13,337 --> 01:09:16,934
so they are alive again, they try to
change the idea of what is death...

461
01:09:22,933 --> 01:09:30,437
- This is a well known situation.
It is called apparent death.

462
01:09:36,133 --> 01:09:43,335
Where people for 3 days remain in
a state of death without pulse

463
01:09:46,034 --> 01:09:57,738
or anything indicating death and after 3
days they get resurrected. Necrophania.

464
01:10:11,136 --> 01:10:14,734
Nobody knows how this happens.

465
01:10:16,236 --> 01:10:32,133
There are people who bury themselves for
15 days in a grave they put over soil

466
01:10:33,335 --> 01:10:37,535
and stay there for 10 days and then
they dig them out and they are alive.

467
01:10:39,438 --> 01:10:46,938
No oxygen no food. I do not
understand what happens.

468
01:10:51,741 --> 01:10:55,938
The problem is you have to realize something
else in order to understand what I say.

469
01:10:58,641 --> 01:11:04,339
The organism from the moment it is
on an attack whether by medicine

470
01:11:04,636 --> 01:11:08,236
or by disease starts a reaction.

471
01:11:10,939 --> 01:11:21,741
As the reaction is not enough to cure
to get rid of the disease the pathology

472
01:11:22,041 --> 01:11:24,439
that is created increases.

473
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:35,540
You have to imagine yourself all the time
there is a new effort of the organism

474
01:11:36,137 --> 01:11:43,336
to go on a second line of defense.
On a 3rd line of defense.

475
01:11:46,036 --> 01:11:55,037
So when it starts with an influenza
which ends up in meningitis.

476
01:11:56,239 --> 01:12:06,439
That is a third line of defense. The
organism still is struggling to survive.

477
01:12:09,138 --> 01:12:12,738
He may pass the redline
and then finish.

478
01:12:16,939 --> 01:12:27,739
The idea is with the remedy will
pass the redline sooner or later.

479
01:12:28,939 --> 01:12:34,036
If we catch the organism during the time of
his reaction he gives us some information

480
01:12:35,536 --> 01:12:41,836
then we help him to come back.

481
01:12:45,136 --> 01:12:53,241
If it is over then you give the remedy
and see that it speeds up death.

482
01:12:58,037 --> 01:13:11,237
You have to have in mind this idea because
as I said a cancer is not created

483
01:13:11,836 --> 01:13:13,339
from one day to the other.

484
01:13:13,636 --> 01:13:18,138
You had a shock and some reactions
started within the body.

485
01:13:19,939 --> 01:13:24,438
And after 5 years
there is tumor.

486
01:13:26,538 --> 01:13:33,138
A woman is pressurizing herself for years
before she brings out a tumor in the breast.

487
01:13:34,637 --> 01:13:41,837
This tumor was all the
time organizing itself

488
01:13:43,638 --> 01:13:48,741
because the organism did
not have another outlet.

489
01:13:52,936 --> 01:14:04,938
Then the tumor is preparing until it
reaches a moment when the woman sees

490
01:14:06,137 --> 01:14:13,036
that there is a tumor and goes to
examine it. This is cancer now.

491
01:14:16,637 --> 01:14:23,541
Is it going to stop there?
No, why not? 2 reasons.

492
01:14:23,836 --> 01:14:28,638
The organism is weak and the other
reason is why the cancer was created.

493
01:14:28,936 --> 01:14:31,941
You have done something,
you had some shock.

494
01:14:32,836 --> 01:14:34,937
The shock continues to be there.

495
01:14:36,140 --> 01:14:42,139
It is very difficult to cure a case of
cancer in which the cause of cancer

496
01:14:45,741 --> 01:14:49,641
is still within the
psyche of the person.

497
01:14:51,438 --> 01:15:02,240
The moment that you realize that the
woman has a conflict and you solved it

498
01:15:02,838 --> 01:15:10,037
if it was possible, that moment
the cancer is not needed anymore

499
01:15:11,236 --> 01:15:14,238
and may stop the development.

500
01:15:20,236 --> 01:15:27,137
A dissection in a woman who died many
times have found cancer that has stopped.

501
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:35,537
Which developed in the breast
but she died of old age.

502
01:15:43,337 --> 01:15:55,637
This paragraph is not clear and
is not something we can rely on.

503
01:16:01,636 --> 01:16:06,138
Hahnemann was very observant
and he had observed

504
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:17,537
that one time Opium causes diarrhea,
the next causes constipation.

505
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:24,140
So primary reaction is diarrhea,
secondary is constipation.

506
01:16:27,741 --> 01:16:41,838
For a practical we need to write down
the primary or secondary of a proving

507
01:16:42,138 --> 01:16:51,738
of a remedy within 20-30-100 people
who can give us information.

508
01:16:55,941 --> 01:17:10,036
This was the point which I disagree
with all kinds of different discussions

509
01:17:10,641 --> 01:17:16,036
and explanations and
things like that.

510
01:17:22,639 --> 01:17:31,938
Most probably what he meant by primary
and secondary reaction is on a level

511
01:17:32,836 --> 01:17:42,436
which is mostly of a
functional disorders.
