1
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:32,005
I did not make it clear therefore I wanted
to present it again so it can be made clear.

2
00:00:39,501 --> 00:00:42,204
I will read it again.

3
00:00:47,601 --> 00:01:00,203
"In those older prescriptions of the
often dangerous effects of medicines

4
00:01:00,801 --> 00:01:14,904
ingested in excessively large doses we
notice certain states that were produced".

5
00:01:19,102 --> 00:01:31,704
He means the doctors who had written down
the symptoms of the people who were dying.

6
00:01:35,904 --> 00:01:40,404
Keep in mind in those older
prescriptions of those

7
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,404
who ingested in large doses
some states were produced.

8
00:01:49,104 --> 00:01:59,600
"not at the commencement" these states
that they recorded the last state

9
00:01:59,901 --> 00:02:05,603
where they were dying. Not at the
commencement, they did not know

10
00:02:06,202 --> 00:02:09,205
how the whole thing started.

11
00:02:10,104 --> 00:02:15,202
"but towards the termination
of these sad events"

12
00:02:15,801 --> 00:02:21,803
they noted down only when they were
dying, so he was dying, he was in a coma,

13
00:02:22,103 --> 00:02:26,300
grinding his teeth,
they recorded.

14
00:02:29,303 --> 00:02:38,602
"and which were of an exactly opposite
nature to those that first appeared"

15
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:52,903
He sais those records describing
the last stages of poisoning

16
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:05,202
are the exact opposite of the
first symptoms that started.

17
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:21,403
That means you ingest a poison and you get
nausea, chills, vomiting, diarrhea etc.

18
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,103
The pathology progresses
more and more.

19
00:03:31,303 --> 00:03:44,502
We are interested in the functional,
primary symptomatology.

20
00:03:45,401 --> 00:03:49,905
We are not interested in the end
stages when it crosses the red line.

21
00:03:50,202 --> 00:03:54,401
Once the line is
crossed it is useless.

22
00:03:55,304 --> 00:04:03,103
Let us see whether Hahnemann means the
same with what I have said or not.

23
00:04:07,603 --> 00:04:19,004
"These symptoms, the very reverse
of the primary action (par. 63)"

24
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:23,501
that means completely different,
do not take it into consideration.

25
00:04:24,104 --> 00:04:29,202
"or proper action of the medicines" he
considers proper action of the medicine

26
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:33,100
only the primary symptoms,
that means the symptoms

27
00:04:33,704 --> 00:04:40,301
before the organism crosses
the redline and goes dying.

28
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:54,401
"on the vital force are the reaction
of the vital force of the organism,

29
00:05:12,405 --> 00:05:24,705
its secondary action (par.par. 62-67), of which,
however, there is seldom or hardly ever

30
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:32,504
the least trace from experiments with
moderate doses on healthy bodies"

31
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:40,604
in these last stages hardly any
of the symptoms are similar

32
00:05:41,201 --> 00:05:47,502
to the original
functional symptoms.

33
00:05:51,401 --> 00:05:57,202
The last stages where the person
dies which have been recorded

34
00:05:57,801 --> 00:06:08,900
by the toxicologists of the time, who did not
record the primary symptoms, are useless.

35
00:06:11,154 --> 00:06:18,054
This is what I was saying. I will
continue because it is very important.

36
00:06:21,658 --> 00:06:29,562
"However, there is seldom or hardly ever the
least trace from experiments with moderate doses

37
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:44,261
on healthy bodies and from small doses"
in these records there is nothing

38
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:58,963
which we use when we give a small dose and we
have a primary reaction of the vital force.

39
00:07:04,663 --> 00:07:09,459
He is not correct when he says
that but we will discuss it later.

40
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:11,262
He is not absolutely correct.

41
00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:21,764
"In the homoeopathic curative operation"
listen to this because it is important

42
00:07:22,662 --> 00:07:28,062
because it supports another
mistake that he has made

43
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:38,862
concerning the explanation of the reaction of
the organism after the homeopathic remedy.

44
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:51,562
"In the homoeopathic curative operation
the living organism reacts from these

45
00:07:52,460 --> 00:08:10,464
only so much as is requisite"  That
means correct homeopathic remedy.

46
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:23,361
"The living organism reacts from
these only so much as is requisite

47
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:31,763
to raise the health again to the
normal healthy state (par. 67)."

48
00:08:32,363 --> 00:08:41,959
That means the action of the curative remedy
makes the organism raise its response

49
00:08:42,561 --> 00:08:48,563
to the extent that is needed
to bring a curative reaction.

50
00:08:49,163 --> 00:09:04,160
So with this phrase he nullifies the
idea of a stronger medicinal action

51
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:17,959
to suppress weaker natural disease. Here he
says exactly what I have explained before.

52
00:09:18,861 --> 00:09:30,261
The homeopathic remedy raises the
reaction of the organism so much

53
00:09:31,161 --> 00:09:38,060
as it is needed, no more, in
order to overcome the disease.

54
00:09:39,262 --> 00:09:46,162
But this is what I have been
saying when I said that

55
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:59,364
when the homeopathic remedy is prescribed
then there is an aggravation of the symptoms

56
00:09:59,963 --> 00:10:05,960
to the extent that is needed
to bring about a cure.

57
00:10:14,963 --> 00:10:21,261
I see in your eyes
some doubts still.

58
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:40,159
Anyhow, let me recapitulate
and take the essence of this.

59
00:10:44,961 --> 00:10:58,160
The symptoms which are useful for us come
from primary reaction of the vital force.

60
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:17,660
Once these symptoms have reached a stage
which he calls "a sad event" meaning death,

61
00:11:18,561 --> 00:11:25,160
what you record in these last
stage conditions is not useful.

62
00:11:26,962 --> 00:11:38,661
Therefore secondary symptoms, which he
means the last ending symptoms of the life

63
00:11:39,261 --> 00:11:43,759
of the person, are of no use.

64
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:58,159
He says many time the primary symptoms are
the exact opposite of the last symptoms.

65
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:03,861
I'll give you an example
to make it very clear.

66
00:12:06,263 --> 00:12:14,663
In an epileptic fit, convulsions
are the primary symptoms,

67
00:12:17,062 --> 00:12:29,660
a great activity of the body
and then passes the red line

68
00:12:30,861 --> 00:12:40,762
and we have status epilepticus. There
is no action, there is a paralysis.

69
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:59,163
In status epilepticus there is
no more the convulsive activity

70
00:13:00,061 --> 00:13:12,060
which was originally present.
And there is the opposite.

71
00:13:14,762 --> 00:13:23,162
When the organism has reached the
secondary stage the symptoms of it

72
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:27,962
are the opposite actually
of the primary stage.

73
00:13:29,461 --> 00:13:36,661
What we are interested in is the
primary stage and not the secondary.

74
00:13:37,862 --> 00:13:40,260
Let me give you another example.

75
00:13:53,763 --> 00:13:59,759
- I am not a neurologist but from my knowledge,
status epilepticus is an epileptic fit

76
00:14:00,062 --> 00:14:04,563
that lasts more than 30 minutes
so there are still convulsions

77
00:14:04,864 --> 00:14:10,263
and after that post-status there
is this complete paralysis.

78
00:14:12,661 --> 00:14:16,618
But when it is status epilepticus
we still have the epileptic fits.

79
00:14:16,915 --> 00:14:19,017
- Don't play with the words.

80
00:14:19,616 --> 00:14:28,615
What I mean that as long as there is
activity, we call it primary stage.

81
00:14:29,516 --> 00:14:39,916
When it reaches the other part then
we call it the status epilepticus

82
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:42,017
where he has been paralyzed.

83
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:56,115
That second stage, the paralysis, is
of no use to record, homeopathically.

84
00:14:56,416 --> 00:15:05,415
What is homeopathically useful is the
first part which shows the symptoms.

85
00:15:10,518 --> 00:15:19,515
Once the vital force has given up
then there is a comatose state.

86
00:15:22,513 --> 00:15:25,214
- I don't know if it is good
for me to intervene now.

87
00:15:26,117 --> 00:15:37,818
Another example came to my mind. When there
is paroxysmal disturbance of the heart.

88
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:51,213
The heart continues pumping. If it
progresses it gets fibrillated,

89
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:55,714
there is electrical activity
which is completely chaotic,

90
00:15:56,313 --> 00:16:03,813
but it is not pumping anything anymore. The
patient collapses, there is still function

91
00:16:04,115 --> 00:16:07,418
but is completely chaotic.
- Exactly.

92
00:16:08,013 --> 00:16:16,617
These are the stages where Hahnemann separates
between primary and secondary action.

93
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:32,513
You get a very high fever, tremendous
headache, stiffness, meningoencephalitis

94
00:16:35,213 --> 00:16:36,713
but there is a lot of activity.

95
00:16:37,317 --> 00:16:43,013
At a certain moment the activity stops
and the person falls into coma.

96
00:16:43,615 --> 00:16:51,117
That state crosses the line. That
state he calls secondary action.

97
00:16:54,718 --> 00:17:02,513
This secondary stages are not
useful for homeopathic prescribing.

98
00:17:06,714 --> 00:17:21,416
Is it clear? You can ask as many question
as you like until this becomes clear.

99
00:17:21,713 --> 00:17:27,114
Otherwise a kind of confusion
will remain in your mind.

100
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:34,918
- It's clear to me but maybe the
confusion is caused by the fact

101
00:17:35,215 --> 00:17:39,417
that Hahnemann in paragraph
62 and 67 means something...

102
00:17:40,617 --> 00:17:45,714
- Ok let's go to
these paragraphs.

103
00:17:57,713 --> 00:18:01,314
We go to paragraph 62
to see what he says.

104
00:18:02,817 --> 00:18:07,015
"But on what this pernicious result of
the palliative, antipathic treatment

105
00:18:07,613 --> 00:18:11,217
and the efficacy of the reverse, the
homoeopathic treatment, depend,

106
00:18:12,118 --> 00:18:16,917
is explained by the following facts,
deduced from manifold observations,

107
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:24,118
which no one before me perceived, though they
are so very palpable and so very evident,

108
00:18:24,718 --> 00:18:28,318
and are of such infinite
importance to the healing art.

109
00:18:29,513 --> 00:18:37,013
Every agent that acts upon the
vitality, every medicine,

110
00:18:38,213 --> 00:18:50,215
deranges more or less the vital force,
and causes a certain alteration

111
00:18:50,817 --> 00:18:57,718
in the health of the individual
for a longer or a shorter period.

112
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:19,652
This is termed primary action.

113
00:19:20,852 --> 00:19:27,151
Although a product of the medicinal
and vital powers conjointly,

114
00:19:27,748 --> 00:19:32,852
it is principally due
to the former power.

115
00:19:36,447 --> 00:19:43,651
To its action our vital force
endeavors to oppose its own energy.

116
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:52,352
This resistant action is a property, is indeed an
automatic action of our life-preserving power,

117
00:19:52,651 --> 00:20:01,348
which goes by the name of secondary
action or counteraction."

118
00:20:03,408 --> 00:20:15,105
Here secondary action means that the moment
that there is an intrusion in the body

119
00:20:19,606 --> 00:20:26,504
the organism always will
oppose with a symptomatology

120
00:20:30,707 --> 00:20:40,304
and here he uses the word "secondary
action" in a completely different meaning

121
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:44,207
than what he uses there.

122
00:20:50,506 --> 00:20:55,004
What he says here is not correct but I
will explain to you the whole process.

123
00:20:58,304 --> 00:21:06,705
From the moment there is an ingestion in the
human organism of anything inimical to it,

124
00:21:07,306 --> 00:21:20,207
either bacteria or microbes or
viruses or poisoning or bad food,

125
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:34,008
the moment they enter the
organism it scans the situation.

126
00:21:34,605 --> 00:21:43,907
It says what is this? There is something
entering me which is not familiar.

127
00:21:47,804 --> 00:21:54,805
It takes some time to decide
whether it will react or not.

128
00:21:56,007 --> 00:22:01,408
This is called in medical
parlance incubation period.

129
00:22:04,404 --> 00:22:17,009
After this period decides what chemicals
reaction have been done so far,

130
00:22:17,605 --> 00:22:22,406
the 7 days of incubation period,
whatever I have done is not enough,

131
00:22:23,305 --> 00:22:39,805
so he mobilizes the organism on a secondary
step which is vomiting, purging, fever.

132
00:22:40,105 --> 00:22:47,908
This is a secondary reaction 
of the organism.

133
00:22:57,508 --> 00:23:05,360
Therefore from the very beginning
that something enters the organism

134
00:23:05,956 --> 00:23:10,457
which is inimical there is a reaction of the
organism whether we understand it or not

135
00:23:10,758 --> 00:23:15,556
is a different matter and that's why
they have said incubation period

136
00:23:15,859 --> 00:23:21,259
in which we don't have symptoms... we do have
symptoms, we don't really realize them.

137
00:23:22,156 --> 00:23:29,956
There are little things we
don't feel, mild symptoms.

138
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:37,759
The organism has been mobilized already.
But now it allows the problem grow.

139
00:23:38,655 --> 00:23:50,955
The colonies of the bacteria are increasing very
fast so the organism reacts more violently.

140
00:23:51,557 --> 00:23:55,757
But actually calling this primary
or secondary is not correct.

141
00:23:56,358 --> 00:24:07,755
All the time it's the reaction of the vital
force against an agent which endangers life.

142
00:24:08,355 --> 00:24:12,855
From the very beginning there
is reaction of the vital force.

143
00:24:16,756 --> 00:24:22,755
What he say in paragraph
111 is different.

144
00:24:23,357 --> 00:24:31,156
He says those old prescribers, old
people who saved the life of the people

145
00:24:31,758 --> 00:24:41,059
who were poisoned, recorded the last stages,
but instead of saying "the last stages"

146
00:24:43,156 --> 00:24:59,055
he says secondary action of the drug. And
then it was confused with this other.

147
00:24:59,356 --> 00:25:11,958
But further down will explain exactly what he
says. And you will understand even better.

148
00:25:14,658 --> 00:25:16,755
There are 2 stages.

149
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:24,555
One primary in which we have the fighting
of the vital force producing symptoms.

150
00:25:25,755 --> 00:25:31,760
Secondary stage, where the vital force
has given up, there is no fight anymore,

151
00:25:32,658 --> 00:25:39,859
the person has fallen into coma or the last
stages of his life and he passes away.

152
00:25:42,259 --> 00:25:47,658
That is not useful for us to record.
We cannot use it.

153
00:25:48,555 --> 00:25:58,457
What we are interested in is whatever
happens after some moderate doses.

154
00:26:04,755 --> 00:26:07,455
Some new people.

155
00:26:08,656 --> 00:26:14,956
- Your saying is very beautifully reflected
in our basic reaction to stress.

156
00:26:15,555 --> 00:26:20,055
The first reaction to stress
is sympathetic, fight or flee.

157
00:26:26,957 --> 00:26:33,558
This is the primary reaction which produces
fast heartbeat, the blood goes to the muscles,

158
00:26:34,156 --> 00:26:40,156
to the periphery, less blood
going to the digestive system...

159
00:26:40,758 --> 00:26:44,958
In the moment when the body decides
that the stress is too much

160
00:26:45,258 --> 00:26:51,259
then the reaction is completely opposite.
It's parasympathetic, freeze or fold.

161
00:26:51,857 --> 00:26:59,911
And then the blood is taken from the
periphery, the heart rate decreases...

162
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,911
- I understand.

163
00:27:03,511 --> 00:27:11,012
The problem with this explanation
is that whether it is sympathetic

164
00:27:11,313 --> 00:27:17,013
or parasympathetic reaction,
it's still a reaction.

165
00:27:19,111 --> 00:27:25,111
There is still a functional
disturbance which we have recorded.

166
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:33,810
May be the opposite, maybe
alternating as I said before.

167
00:27:35,911 --> 00:27:40,715
When giving a lot of opium first there
is diarrhea, then after a while

168
00:27:42,212 --> 00:27:47,913
it causes a long state
of constipation.

169
00:27:49,415 --> 00:27:54,814
But still these are to be
recorded in useful situations.

170
00:27:56,312 --> 00:28:04,410
What he says in paragraph 112
is; crossing the red line,

171
00:28:05,012 --> 00:28:14,913
those people who wrote down these symptoms of
the poisonings, they described only people

172
00:28:15,212 --> 00:28:29,313
before death, 5 minutes before death
and these stages are not useful for us.

173
00:28:35,015 --> 00:28:40,411
When we say sympathetic/ parasympathetic,
will still have functional symptoms...

174
00:28:49,413 --> 00:28:58,715
I'll give you an example from the
hospital in India. Very characteristic.

175
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:08,610
I was in Calcutta college and
usually though I was a student

176
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:17,614
I was attending together with the attending
physician after the professor came around the wards

177
00:29:20,912 --> 00:29:31,114
of the hospital watching, discussing the cases.
There was a case of acute typhoid fever.

178
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:42,210
The professors would come and ask
questions. Said give Gelsemium, he gave it.

179
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:52,111
I had taken the case and asking together
with the attending physician before them

180
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:59,910
and said he needs Hyoscyamus. Next
day he comes, is worse... Helleborus.

181
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:11,014
I said I said give him Hyoscyamus, he
is going to die. I cannot do it.

182
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:22,114
Don't tell them just give, he will die.
3rd day they gave another remedy.

183
00:30:24,215 --> 00:30:33,814
With the 3rd remedy the fever drops and
he comes excited and said you were wrong.

184
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:39,814
The correct remedy was the last
one, I can't remember what it was.

185
00:30:41,315 --> 00:30:50,914
I went to the patient and I felt the pulse.
The pulse was 200, I couldn't count actually.

186
00:30:55,110 --> 00:31:00,212
I tell them do you think he is
doing better? Yes, no fever.

187
00:31:01,414 --> 00:31:08,313
I said in few hours he will die. Why?
Because there is a perforation.

188
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:17,012
The guts have broken down and blood is coming
out very fast so the heart cannot tolerate.

189
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:31,110
In the afternoon he died. In that
stage you could do nothing anymore.

190
00:31:31,711 --> 00:31:35,612
Whether you give Hyoscyamus in
that stage is not important

191
00:31:35,912 --> 00:31:39,810
because the picture is not there.
There is no vital force to react.

192
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:51,814
The guts have broken, big arteries were
open and the blood was flowing out.

193
00:31:55,713 --> 00:32:05,612
No fever, no symptoms. This
is what I am trying to say.

194
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:16,114
- As far as I understand and
please correct me if it's wrong,

195
00:32:17,311 --> 00:32:23,010
as long as you can observe the effort of
the organism to get rid of the poison

196
00:32:23,314 --> 00:32:30,512
or to overcome the disease, the
symptoms are important for us.

197
00:32:33,214 --> 00:32:38,314
If you see a poisoning you have
to write it down and in a disease

198
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:42,814
these are the symptoms you have to
take in order to cure a patient.

199
00:32:43,413 --> 00:32:54,510
At that moment you see the organism
giving up overcoming the poisoning.

200
00:32:56,610 --> 00:33:01,413
The symptoms you see at this moment
are useless for us. Is this correct?

201
00:33:02,311 --> 00:33:08,612
- If I understood well you say that
from the moment when the patient

202
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:15,812
is going in the last stage
symptoms are not useful.

203
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:21,510
- At the moment when you cannot see
an effort to come back to life.

204
00:33:23,615 --> 00:33:29,910
You see no effort of the organism come
back to life or to overcome the poisoning.

205
00:33:30,513 --> 00:33:31,714
At this moment it's useless.

206
00:33:32,311 --> 00:33:37,713
- The vital force has given up.
I can't react anymore.

207
00:33:38,614 --> 00:33:50,013
Because the actual pathology, that means
the heart is blocked in 5 places,

208
00:33:50,314 --> 00:33:53,911
forget it, I give up, I
can't pass the blood.

209
00:33:55,714 --> 00:34:06,812
The liver is cirrhosed and it blows up and it's
finished, the last stages of liver cirrhosis.

210
00:34:08,315 --> 00:34:15,214
The last stages of typhoid fever, encephalitis
or whatever, they fall into coma.

211
00:34:15,812 --> 00:34:25,110
This stage in paragraph 112 Hahnemann
calls secondary reaction.

212
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:39,410
"secondary action, of which, however, there
is seldom or hardly ever the least trace

213
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:50,210
from experiments with moderate doses" That
means the experiment with small doses

214
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:56,513
brings up 2 matters.

215
00:34:57,112 --> 00:35:06,711
One is the fact that the doctors who have described
the poisonings describe the last stages.

216
00:35:07,911 --> 00:35:16,312
And these last stages he said when
we try the remedy on moderate doses,

217
00:35:16,613 --> 00:35:22,312
they gave out some symptoms, these symptoms
have nothing to do with the last stage

218
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:29,510
which was without
symptomatology.

219
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:37,010
- Yesterday you mentioned the
bipolar character of the remedies.

220
00:35:40,314 --> 00:35:45,712
- Wait, the bipolar will come
later I think. My problem is that

221
00:35:46,312 --> 00:35:48,110
before I come I
should have read it.

222
00:35:51,710 --> 00:36:01,310
But I don't have time. Let
me read the other paragraph.

223
00:36:06,715 --> 00:36:14,214
- I understand something slightly different
with primary and secondary action.

224
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:19,312
What I understand is that primary action
is when the organism gets insulted

225
00:36:19,913 --> 00:36:25,014
by something and the vital force
reacts and it produces some symptoms

226
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:30,110
which are the primary action. Then the
organism tries to do a healing process.

227
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:35,812
The healing process
might be successful.

228
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:49,614
Sometimes you have an influenza
or not when you take a poison.

229
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:55,315
During this healing process you might have
some opposite symptoms to the primary action.

230
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:58,910
For example if you make a poison
which is poisonous to the kidneys

231
00:36:59,812 --> 00:37:04,910
and at first you may have oliguria which means
you have scanty urine or not urination at all.

232
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:11,210
Then if the organism is successful
in overcoming this poisonous agent

233
00:37:11,513 --> 00:37:15,410
then you have a
phase of polyuria.

234
00:37:16,615 --> 00:37:22,611
The scanty urine which is attributed to the
poisonous agent, this is the primary action.

235
00:37:22,911 --> 00:37:26,513
The polyuria is the secondary reaction.
The only problem when taking a poison

236
00:37:26,814 --> 00:37:30,414
is when the secondary action is
not successful, then you die.

237
00:37:31,013 --> 00:37:34,913
That's what I understand.
- No.

238
00:37:38,815 --> 00:37:48,410
As long as there is a vital force
which is in a position to react

239
00:37:48,715 --> 00:37:56,511
whether it is reacting one way or another
it is considered primary action,

240
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:05,213
it doesn't matter what can be
because when we give a remedy

241
00:38:05,812 --> 00:38:17,515
there is many time severe aggravation.
This is not considered the opposite.

242
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:23,812
We may consider it as different
type of symptomatology

243
00:38:24,713 --> 00:38:30,714
but not secondary reaction
in the meaning of Hahnemann.

244
00:38:32,514 --> 00:38:43,010
The secondary action on this paragraph
is referred to the old prescribers.

245
00:38:47,813 --> 00:38:57,711
He should say describers. Those who have
described the last stages of diseases.

246
00:38:59,512 --> 00:39:13,311
He compares his experience
with moderate doses

247
00:39:14,514 --> 00:39:24,410
with what the old prescribers have described
as the end result of poisoning and he says

248
00:39:24,713 --> 00:39:40,612
that these contain hardly any useful symptom
of the original reaction of the organism.

249
00:39:47,513 --> 00:39:54,110
- I would like to tell something about
primary action and secondary action.

250
00:39:56,812 --> 00:40:03,410
When Hahnemann is explaining about primary
and secondary action from aphorism 63.

251
00:40:10,012 --> 00:40:17,812
Hahnemann is explaining about the
operation of homeopathic medicine.

252
00:40:20,514 --> 00:40:30,713
In aphorism 63 Hahnemann is telling the primary
action is the action of the agent on the body.

253
00:40:31,314 --> 00:40:40,311
For example you have coffee. The action
of coffee in the body is sleeplessness.

254
00:40:40,912 --> 00:40:42,712
That is primary action.

255
00:40:48,114 --> 00:40:54,712
And secondary action of the vital force
which is sleepiness after 3 hours.

256
00:40:57,713 --> 00:41:01,312
If you take coffee for 3
hours you don't have sleep

257
00:41:02,211 --> 00:41:06,410
(that is the action of caffeine on
the body, that is primary action)

258
00:41:07,012 --> 00:41:24,114
then the vital force reacts... The
primary action of coffee is no sleep...

259
00:41:28,311 --> 00:41:29,810
- I understood now.

260
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:35,514
I have said that but this is not
what he means in this paragraph.

261
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:43,914
We will explain eventually that this cannot
be called primary but alternating symptoms.

262
00:41:44,513 --> 00:41:52,314
That means in the beginning it causes sleeplessness
and in the end it causes sleepiness.

263
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:58,311
These are still useful symptoms. You
don't have to call them secondary.

264
00:42:07,012 --> 00:42:16,713
Paragraph 115. "Among these symptoms, there
occur in the case of some medicines not a few

265
00:42:17,014 --> 00:42:24,810
which are partially, or under certain
conditions, directly opposite to other symptoms

266
00:42:25,414 --> 00:42:28,710
that have previously or
subsequently appeared,

267
00:42:29,312 --> 00:42:35,913
but which are not therefore to be
regarded as actual secondary action

268
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:44,913
or the mere reaction of the vital force, but
which only represent the alternating state

269
00:42:45,214 --> 00:42:52,713
of the various paroxysms of the primary
action; they are termed alternating actions."

270
00:42:53,314 --> 00:42:57,514
This is very clear. Exactly
the coffee example.

271
00:42:58,115 --> 00:43:05,311
It firstly brings sleeplessness
and then it gives sleepiness.

272
00:43:06,813 --> 00:43:09,212
He says not to call
it secondary action.

273
00:43:11,311 --> 00:43:16,413
Because he understands that George
and his students will be confused

274
00:43:17,311 --> 00:43:26,013
with what I wrote and so I have to explain in
paragraph 115, don't call them secondary action,

275
00:43:26,614 --> 00:43:32,014
call them "alternating actions".

276
00:43:40,114 --> 00:43:47,011
- I just wanted to show something on the
board to confirm if I am right or not.

277
00:43:49,414 --> 00:43:51,214
Just 1 minute.

278
00:43:51,083 --> 00:43:53,183
- What are you going to write?

279
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:24,463
- I think that this is
the primary action.

280
00:44:25,958 --> 00:44:33,561
And that's the turning point where there is
a secondary action and then comes death.

281
00:44:35,362 --> 00:44:45,260
This is when the vital force is doing something
good to me, so it's trying to cure myself...

282
00:44:56,061 --> 00:45:04,161
What I understood is when we give a medicine
to person who is diseased, the vital force...

283
00:45:08,359 --> 00:45:11,359
- Once you give a remedy
is a different story.

284
00:45:11,745 --> 00:45:20,446
We are talking no the provings of
the remedies and which are the provings

285
00:45:21,042 --> 00:45:23,443
that we have to take
into consideration.

286
00:45:24,043 --> 00:45:33,042
The proving we have to take into consideration
are those of the reaction of the vital force,

287
00:45:33,644 --> 00:45:38,743
of the defense mechanism.
And these are valid.

288
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:46,647
Once this has happened...
There I don't understand.

289
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:51,452
- It's the turning point.

290
00:45:52,051 --> 00:45:59,251
After that point the symptoms are 5 minutes
before death. These are of no use.

291
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:09,749
- If this is 5 minutes before death you
ignore it. No information from that part.

292
00:46:14,247 --> 00:46:23,548
These are the most important here
that you will take into consideration

293
00:46:24,451 --> 00:46:34,749
and once this happens that means the vital
force has given up we call it 'no reaction'

294
00:46:35,347 --> 00:46:44,347
because there is an artery that has
been ruptured and the blood is flowing

295
00:46:45,547 --> 00:46:49,752
until a certain moment
there is some reaction.

296
00:46:50,347 --> 00:46:58,752
At a certain moment where the blood is
out there is a paucity of symptoms, faints,

297
00:47:00,548 --> 00:47:07,748
if you touch the pulse
you will see 300bpm.

298
00:47:08,647 --> 00:47:13,150
- What I said is ok?
- Yes.

299
00:47:13,714 --> 00:47:17,087
This is what I have
been saying all along.

300
00:47:29,084 --> 00:47:32,726
There is another paragraph

301
00:47:33,626 --> 00:47:40,229
which I don't think anybody will be
able to understand what Hahnemann says.

302
00:47:44,724 --> 00:47:56,726
Paragraph 113. You know the 13
number is always a difficult number.

303
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:05,725
"The only exceptions to this
are the narcotic medicines."

304
00:48:06,324 --> 00:48:14,427
Opium, morphine, hashish
in big quantities etc.

305
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:20,726
"As they, in their primary action, take away
sometimes the sensibility and sensation,

306
00:48:21,025 --> 00:48:25,525
sometimes the irritability, it frequently
happens that in their secondary action,

307
00:48:25,825 --> 00:48:28,825
even from moderate experimental
doses on healthy bodies,

308
00:48:29,424 --> 00:48:32,727
an increased sensibility (and a
greater irritability) is observable."

309
00:48:33,026 --> 00:48:42,026
If anybody can tell me what this paragraph
is saying I will give him the 1st prize!

310
00:48:44,128 --> 00:49:00,626
The problem is this is definitely a bad
translation but if somebody has the German...

311
00:49:09,326 --> 00:49:21,926
Because I have another book here which
gives a little bit better translation.

312
00:49:23,125 --> 00:49:28,525
115. If you can translate
it in your own words.

313
00:49:30,326 --> 00:49:39,928
- If somebody takes narcotics and
makes a proving he has 2 stages.

314
00:49:40,224 --> 00:49:51,026
In the first stage he gets some
symptoms like he is happier or duller

315
00:49:51,627 --> 00:50:01,525
and the next day maybe he is more irritable.
It's like some kind of dependency.

316
00:50:03,626 --> 00:50:13,829
I wouldn't call it secondary action. If
somebody takes narcotics symptoms are produced.

317
00:50:14,726 --> 00:50:18,926
If the medicine is stopped then
he might have withdrawal symptoms

318
00:50:19,526 --> 00:50:24,628
which are different from the symptoms
produced by opium or marijuana.

319
00:50:26,729 --> 00:50:39,026
- I will read it now from
another translator Wesselhoeft.

320
00:50:50,426 --> 00:50:54,328
"Only narcotic drugs should be
regarded as exceptions to this rule.

321
00:50:54,926 --> 00:51:02,426
As these destroy sensibility and
sensation, as well as irritability,

322
00:51:03,026 --> 00:51:09,925
in their primary effect, a
heightened state both of sensibility

323
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:14,124
and of irritability is frequently
observed in healthy persons,

324
00:51:14,726 --> 00:51:21,928
as an after-effect following the
administration of narcotics"

325
00:51:24,324 --> 00:51:37,524
Not as secondary action. After-effect.
Thank you.

326
00:51:43,528 --> 00:51:51,328
Hahnemann wants to cover as many possibilities
as possible he even speaks about narcotics.

327
00:51:51,626 --> 00:52:05,728
What he says; in the primary effect of
narcotics, you take opium, you are happy.

328
00:52:06,329 --> 00:52:16,825
You don't have any symptoms. The sensibility
and sensitivity and irritability are gone.

329
00:52:18,325 --> 00:52:26,126
This is the opposite with the usual
other whatever substance you may take.

330
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:33,329
Because immediately in other
substance the organism would react

331
00:52:33,625 --> 00:52:36,329
and the person would
feel this reaction.

332
00:52:37,226 --> 00:52:45,928
But in narcotics the sensitivity and sensibility
is destroyed, the person doesn't feel.

333
00:52:46,226 --> 00:52:52,226
That why with opium we say
the patient feels fine.

334
00:52:54,026 --> 00:52:58,527
And we take into consideration
not the symptoms

335
00:52:58,824 --> 00:53:09,928
but the fact the person says I am fine though
he is lying down there with 40 C fever.

336
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:17,428
We take into consideration that the
person says I am feeling fine.

337
00:53:19,527 --> 00:53:32,425
Because in narcotics the sensitivity and the
irritability of the organism has been destroyed.

338
00:53:35,426 --> 00:53:48,026
But later on of course, after the effect, the
organism comes back with sensitivity, irritability,

339
00:53:50,424 --> 00:54:10,829
as an aftereffect of the primary action. This
is what today we call withdrawal syndrome.

340
00:54:19,829 --> 00:54:28,526
That means the real effect of the
drug does not appear immediately.

341
00:54:28,826 --> 00:54:39,626
On the contrary, immediately appears
a kind of sedation, insensibility.

342
00:54:42,926 --> 00:54:52,527
But once this is gone the vital force
comes back and reacts as an after-effect,

343
00:54:53,126 --> 00:55:09,525
side-effects of people taking opium,
heroine. They have withdrawal syndrome.

344
00:55:11,327 --> 00:55:15,529
But if you read it the way he
writes it nobody can understand.

345
00:55:28,426 --> 00:55:33,225
Now is it clear? I don't believe
that anybody understood.

346
00:55:39,524 --> 00:55:49,125
This Greek gastroenterologist
is a very inquisitive woman.

347
00:55:54,527 --> 00:56:01,725
- He says that aftereffect in narcotic
comes even for moderate doses of the drug.

348
00:56:11,026 --> 00:56:14,026
- Even a little bit of opium
may give you a sedation.

349
00:56:14,628 --> 00:56:21,226
- But this doesn't happen
with other substances.

350
00:56:21,826 --> 00:56:32,026
- It doesn't happen with other drugs because
if you take let's say 3 gr of Nux vomica

351
00:56:33,524 --> 00:56:38,925
or strychnine the reaction will
be much stronger and immediate.

352
00:56:39,826 --> 00:56:47,926
In narcotics first there is sedation, the
sensibility is gone, and you feel quite good.

353
00:56:48,526 --> 00:56:51,828
This is why people
take these drugs.

354
00:56:52,128 --> 00:57:03,228
Because as a primary action they feel
excellent, they have sometimes experiences

355
00:57:04,125 --> 00:57:18,826
which are "spiritual". It's not spiritual
experiences, it experience of the spirit, alcohol.

356
00:57:25,724 --> 00:57:34,724
Both give experiences but
not of the same quality.

357
00:57:38,924 --> 00:57:43,129
- Because they are narcotics there is this
aftereffect where in other substances

358
00:57:43,427 --> 00:57:46,127
there is only the primary
effect, no aftereffect.

359
00:57:46,724 --> 00:57:50,625
- This is not secondary action.
This is aftereffect.

360
00:57:51,225 --> 00:57:54,524
If you call it secondary action then
you are confused with the word.

361
00:57:54,828 --> 00:57:59,328
Because you stuck with the
words and you are confused.

362
00:57:59,925 --> 00:58:05,628
Because the translators were not
as careful as we are in analyzing.

363
00:58:07,125 --> 00:58:08,628
This is the problem.

364
00:58:23,327 --> 00:58:29,626
- Maybe you can explain people taking
a lot of alcohol as a narcotic

365
00:58:30,228 --> 00:58:40,128
and they day after they have the after
effect. And they have to drink.

366
00:58:40,726 --> 00:58:44,326
There are lots of drugs on
which people are addicted

367
00:58:44,054 --> 00:58:47,649
because the aftereffect
was 'I need more'.

368
00:58:48,249 --> 00:58:53,351
If I get a little more for a
short time I have a good feeling

369
00:58:53,649 --> 00:58:57,253
and then they need
more and more.

370
00:58:58,150 --> 00:59:05,949
- More and more to keep a state of
happiness. Artificial happiness.

371
00:59:11,649 --> 00:59:17,354
- An understandable example from life that
comes to my mind is the sedation to animals.

372
00:59:17,953 --> 00:59:23,050
When we use sedation they lose the
ability to feel pain and hear

373
00:59:23,654 --> 00:59:28,753
but when they wake up they are much
more sensitive to noise and light.

374
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:30,551
- Exactly!

375
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:41,953
- Can you explain this theory with
the example allergic reaction?

376
00:59:42,852 --> 00:59:56,350
For instance allergic reaction to penicillin if
there is skin reaction? Anaphylactic reaction.

377
01:00:07,454 --> 01:00:16,149
- There are organisms who are more sensitive
to certain substances than others.

378
01:00:17,652 --> 01:00:26,352
So there are people at this moment that are
so sensitive to penicillin as you mention

379
01:00:26,954 --> 01:00:32,649
that by smelling penicillin
can go into coma.

380
01:00:35,053 --> 01:00:38,051
Why they have become so
sensitive is another story.

381
01:00:38,649 --> 01:00:43,453
Most probably the mother or the
father had taken a lot of penicillin

382
01:00:44,350 --> 01:00:50,952
and the child is born with a
predisposition for this particular drug

383
01:00:51,253 --> 01:00:55,751
and then this drug can bring
about a terrific reaction.

384
01:00:57,254 --> 01:01:00,854
The same happens with
drugs, I believe.

385
01:01:01,149 --> 01:01:08,952
People who are coming from parents
who are used to narcotics.

386
01:01:10,153 --> 01:01:18,851
Such children will be much more sensitive
to the touch of the narcotics.

387
01:01:19,450 --> 01:01:30,552
And I have seen cases that people who are
coming from parents who are alcoholics,

388
01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:41,949
they themselves have never touched alcohol.
They say I don't like alcohol.

389
01:01:42,552 --> 01:01:50,950
That means there is a relationship
between alcohol and themselves

390
01:01:51,552 --> 01:01:54,853
which is of very
sensitive nature.

391
01:01:55,153 --> 01:01:59,952
They feel if they touch alcohol
either they feel very bad

392
01:02:00,553 --> 01:02:05,951
or maybe they will go into the
habit of drinking quite a lot.

393
01:02:07,153 --> 01:02:14,054
I have noticed children of parents who
were alcoholics don't touch alcohol.

394
01:02:15,554 --> 01:02:22,152
On the contrary those who touch
they go very fast into alcoholism.

395
01:02:29,354 --> 01:02:31,152
- I would like to
come back to Organon.

396
01:02:31,753 --> 01:02:39,852
In paragraph 112 where you can
read about the secondary action

397
01:02:40,153 --> 01:02:45,250
and the original German
word is the after-action.

398
01:02:45,850 --> 01:02:52,453
Even in paragraph 112 he writes about the
after-action. Not of the secondary action.

399
01:02:53,049 --> 01:02:59,049
- In paragraph 62
what word is used?

400
01:03:08,053 --> 01:03:19,149
- In paragraph 63 it's the after... opposite
acting, not the secondary acting.

401
01:03:21,252 --> 01:03:24,253
The after action or
opposite action.

402
01:03:40,154 --> 01:03:45,850
- When we use the narcotics as remedies,
do we take into consideration both

403
01:03:46,449 --> 01:03:49,752
the primary and the
after-effects?

404
01:04:01,449 --> 01:04:13,752
- The aftereffect of the narcotics is a
reaction of the vital force from small doses.

405
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:23,952
Therefore we take it as a symptoms
of the remedy we are examining.

406
01:04:24,550 --> 01:04:28,752
- So we take both the irritability
and the loss of irritability.

407
01:04:29,051 --> 01:04:30,252
- Yes. It is a series.

408
01:04:30,549 --> 01:04:42,249
The fact that the vital force in the first by the
narcotic becomes sedated,

409
01:04:45,552 --> 01:04:59,649
does not speak out with violence or anger,
is still a reaction of the vital force.

410
01:05:02,949 --> 01:05:10,149
From the very moment the substance goes
into the human body the vital force

411
01:05:10,752 --> 01:05:17,051
starts reacting and
evaluating, like scanning.

412
01:05:17,352 --> 01:05:22,750
Evaluating; something has entered
me, can I deal with that easily?

413
01:05:24,553 --> 01:05:31,154
If it is food I can, if it is
overeating I have a problem.

414
01:05:31,751 --> 01:05:35,952
What is the problem?
I don't feel well.

415
01:05:38,051 --> 01:05:47,051
I need to vomit now because of overeating.
Even simple food.

416
01:05:47,649 --> 01:05:56,952
We don't take into consideration as
symptom after eating the problems

417
01:05:58,151 --> 01:06:13,450
because if we overeat like that, we have
fish, soup, meat, fat meat, salad, fruits,

418
01:06:14,052 --> 01:06:25,749
sweets, alcohol and then I say I don't
feel well now, I have to vomit.

419
01:06:26,651 --> 01:06:32,051
Which is the cause of the vomiting? You
cannot say out of all these you have eaten.

420
01:06:33,249 --> 01:06:40,152
We call it overeating. The organism reacts
but the organism to a certain point

421
01:06:41,049 --> 01:06:45,253
when you put things inside
says ok I can deal with that.

422
01:06:47,349 --> 01:06:53,952
After a certain point starts
saying I cannot deal with that.

423
01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:59,351
Do not give me more. You
keep on drinking...

424
01:07:03,251 --> 01:07:26,949
Once in my life I got drunk, 3 of us were
18, we went to Plaka under the Acropolis

425
01:07:29,652 --> 01:07:46,750
to have some wine and eat... it was a big
thing the 3 of us... because we had no idea.

426
01:07:47,051 --> 01:07:58,751
We had never drunk before so
we ordered wine, retsina.

427
01:07:59,951 --> 01:08:12,549
Bring us 200 drams which
is about 1/3 of a kilo.

428
01:08:20,050 --> 01:08:34,154
We ordered some meze you know some snack
but the snack took a long time to come

429
01:08:35,349 --> 01:08:44,649
and we were drinking in the meantime we
were drinking the wine 300 grams of wine.

430
01:08:45,252 --> 01:08:47,649
That means 100 and 100 and 100.

431
01:08:50,050 --> 01:08:55,750
We finished the 300 gram and
we ordered another 300.

432
01:08:59,049 --> 01:09:05,949
By the time the meze snack came we are
in the middle of the second bouts

433
01:09:06,553 --> 01:09:12,852
which was about 150
grams to each one.

434
01:09:19,152 --> 01:09:23,949
The meze snack came and by the
time we started eating the meze

435
01:09:24,549 --> 01:09:35,650
because we were not used to drinking this
little wine made us all totally drunk.

436
01:09:46,149 --> 01:09:58,750
I remember that when the waiter came
to be paid to make the account,

437
01:10:02,353 --> 01:10:17,952
the bill was 38 drachmas. We
had a note of 100 drachmas.

438
01:10:20,949 --> 01:10:33,254
The bill was less than 50 percent so we were
so drunk that one of us gives the 100 drachmas

439
01:10:33,849 --> 01:10:49,752
and the waiter was about to give us the
change. One of us says keep the change.

440
01:10:55,753 --> 01:11:06,249
In the meantime I wanted to say 'no it
is too much' but I was laughing so much

441
01:11:06,854 --> 01:11:20,649
that I could not talk. The waiter
waited... this is my chance...

442
01:11:23,951 --> 01:11:29,649
For a long time I could not say this
is too much, they could not realize.

443
01:11:30,854 --> 01:11:35,349
I was the only one who could
realize but I could not speak.

444
01:11:37,152 --> 01:11:38,353
It was impossible.

445
01:11:38,954 --> 01:11:50,051
Anyhow the waiter understood that and he gave
the change and we took the bus to go home.

446
01:11:51,251 --> 01:11:58,153
In the bus we keep on
laughing all the time.

447
01:11:59,353 --> 01:12:01,751
Everybody was looking at us.

448
01:12:03,249 --> 01:12:12,249
As you know I had no parents from the age
of 11 and was living with aunts and uncles.

449
01:12:13,149 --> 01:12:26,949
I go home and I lie and my aunt looks at
me, where have you been, it's 11 o'clock?

450
01:12:29,349 --> 01:12:39,849
I pretend that I don't understand and I
go to bed and lie and the moment I lie

451
01:12:40,449 --> 01:12:54,249
all comes out and I rushed to the toilet.
I could not smell wine for 6 months.

452
01:12:58,149 --> 01:13:03,849
Even today if I drink more than
2 glasses of wine I am out.

453
01:13:05,349 --> 01:13:12,251
I cannot tolerate. But this was a
very interesting experience for me.

454
01:13:35,649 --> 01:13:41,349
I think that with such a difficult
subject we have to say some stories.

455
01:13:47,649 --> 01:13:59,053
- If I understood well. Hahnemann made a
confusion, he defines in paragraph 113

456
01:13:59,953 --> 01:14:06,851
and in 63 in a way the primary and secondary
action and completely different way

457
01:14:07,752 --> 01:14:10,753
he speaks and using the
same words in 112.

458
01:14:11,652 --> 01:14:15,849
- This is actually
confusing the whole issue.

459
01:14:24,251 --> 01:14:29,951
- We should take into consideration
that we are talking about provings.

460
01:14:35,654 --> 01:14:48,251
- He mixes the provings he had done with the
description of toxic effects from the people

461
01:14:48,552 --> 01:15:00,851
who have died and he says this is a secondary
action don't take it into consideration.

462
01:15:01,752 --> 01:15:10,151
What you have to take into consideration
are symptoms from small doses

463
01:15:14,949 --> 01:15:25,750
and some primary symptoms that were happening
in these people who died with poisoning,

464
01:15:26,654 --> 01:15:32,651
they must have started with some
symptoms that are useful for us.

465
01:15:33,849 --> 01:15:40,751
The symptoms which are useful for
us eventually were toxic symptoms

466
01:15:41,049 --> 01:15:50,051
that have been described in cases that have
been poisoned by poisonous substances.

467
01:15:50,654 --> 01:16:00,849
Like the Rhus tox, Nux vomica, Ignatia... most
probably these drugs containing strychnine.

468
01:16:06,551 --> 01:16:16,453
They were used for poisoning.
I would like you to continue.

469
01:16:18,849 --> 01:16:26,654
- In paragraph 105, he
calls it pharmacology.

470
01:16:32,051 --> 01:16:40,149
He says we have to find out what happens
with the healing with our remedies...

471
01:16:50,953 --> 01:17:05,350
We have in Germany, a doctor who has a
book that writes about the toxicology

472
01:17:05,652 --> 01:17:17,652
and happened to people in older times with
Arsenicum and then he talks about the provings.

473
01:17:19,151 --> 01:17:23,351
- So he combines the poisoning
with the proving symptoms

474
01:17:24,251 --> 01:17:33,250
and completes the picture of the drug.
That is correct.

475
01:17:34,154 --> 01:17:41,952
But in the way that these paragraphs
are written, confusion is caused.

476
01:17:42,551 --> 01:17:48,250
Unless you really understand the spirit
of it, and not the letter of that.

477
01:17:49,750 --> 01:17:51,552
Then it comes to mind.

478
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:11,651
If I give you 5 words, you look at
them ,do they have any meaning? No.

479
01:18:13,149 --> 01:18:25,450
Now you connect these words with some
others and the 5 words make a meaning.

480
01:18:31,752 --> 01:18:37,151
But the meaning of this
phrase is difficult.

481
01:18:38,349 --> 01:18:42,252
Not everybody will
understand what it means.

482
01:18:45,851 --> 01:18:55,187
20 people first read the words and they
mean nothing, then they are connected

483
01:18:56,049 --> 01:18:59,051
and mean something
for everybody.

484
01:19:02,349 --> 01:19:08,651
The real meaning of the phrase
was only understood only by few.

485
01:19:09,851 --> 01:19:26,249
By whom was the meaning understood? By those who
had it already in their spirit, in their mind.

486
01:19:29,551 --> 01:19:38,553
I will tell you a word, freedom.
Tell me, what it means for you.

487
01:19:39,450 --> 01:19:47,550
For each one it has a meaning. I want
to be free to do whatever I like.

488
01:19:48,151 --> 01:19:55,353
I want not to have my mother
or father say anything...

489
01:20:01,351 --> 01:20:08,549
Each one understands the word
freedom in a different way.

490
01:20:16,952 --> 01:20:28,951
Which is the real freedom? I
don't want dictatorships.

491
01:20:35,850 --> 01:20:41,850
Is this the meaning of
freedom in its real sense?

492
01:20:45,754 --> 01:20:52,651
Can anybody take away my freedom
because he is a dictator?

493
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:59,551
Yes they can, because if I speak
against them they will put me in jail.

494
01:21:00,753 --> 01:21:02,554
That is one meaning.

495
01:21:05,251 --> 01:21:13,652
If you think more about it
more, what is to be free?

496
01:21:18,753 --> 01:21:29,252
These are the considerations that made
me write the definition of health

497
01:21:31,651 --> 01:21:45,150
as freedom from pain,
passion, egoism ...

498
01:21:45,754 --> 01:21:54,753
if you meditate upon these meanings you will
find out that my understanding of freedom

499
01:21:55,351 --> 01:22:00,151
is different than from the
understanding of a freedom fighter.

500
01:22:09,152 --> 01:22:14,553
Do they understand freedom
the way I do? No.

501
01:22:15,152 --> 01:22:28,052
Who is right? Who has real freedom?
I'll give some examples.

502
01:22:33,449 --> 01:22:44,249
You have an affair with a woman,
you are very attached to her,

503
01:22:45,450 --> 01:22:55,952
your whole life depends on that woman, you
want her to be happy and always with you.

504
01:23:02,551 --> 01:23:07,651
Do you believe that such
a person is free? No.

505
01:23:08,553 --> 01:23:13,052
He depends entirely on what
the other person will say.

506
01:23:14,251 --> 01:23:28,351
Even the least comment can make the
other person totally desperate

507
01:23:30,150 --> 01:23:39,449
because the person you love said you are
this or that is enough to destroy you.

508
01:23:40,652 --> 01:23:47,253
Therefore you depend your life,
happiness on that person.

509
01:23:48,152 --> 01:23:54,151
The moment you are with the person you are
very happy as long as you are together.

510
01:23:55,351 --> 01:24:07,051
When will you become free? When
you still love this person

511
01:24:08,253 --> 01:24:18,452
but are not attached to it to that degree.
You can be free at the same time.

512
01:24:19,649 --> 01:24:28,653
You have love for this person,
these are good feeling.

513
01:24:31,351 --> 01:24:37,050
The moment that you are
attached that is a passion.

514
01:24:37,353 --> 01:24:39,751
I want this woman
nobody will touch her.

515
01:24:40,654 --> 01:24:52,952
Like all the Lachesis cases like
to keep their passion/relation,

516
01:24:54,151 --> 01:25:00,151
not to be touched by
the other gender.

517
01:25:01,052 --> 01:25:10,351
The moment Lachesis sees the husband
greeting a woman... looks at the hands

518
01:25:10,953 --> 01:25:28,652
how much they touch... that is attachment.
Then you are not free.

519
01:25:28,953 --> 01:25:37,952
If you love but at the same time you
can say she is free. She can go.

520
01:25:40,050 --> 01:25:43,351
Then there is love and freedom.

521
01:25:44,852 --> 01:25:54,751
The greatest freedom of all of course, nobody
has, is be free of the ego and the selfishness.

522
01:25:57,151 --> 01:26:02,852
We can forget that. No one
can be free of the ego.

523
01:26:08,554 --> 01:26:17,851
Some people have given up their ego
quite a lot but entirely? Forget it.

524
01:26:18,451 --> 01:26:20,551
There is nobody.

525
01:26:21,751 --> 01:26:32,554
Do not aspire to be free of egotism because
the moment you are totally free of egotism

526
01:26:33,152 --> 01:26:43,951
you will be connected to the next world and you
will live in paradise but not in this world.

527
01:26:44,253 --> 01:26:49,951
You will be in the next
world, it will be very nice.

528
01:26:55,952 --> 01:27:07,351
So all spiritual attainments drive towards
the elimination of this ego centered sense.

529
01:27:08,849 --> 01:27:13,051
That is the spiritual
driving of all persons.
