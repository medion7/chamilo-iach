1
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:23,904
There are so many different
substances in the world.

2
00:00:24,389 --> 00:00:29,413
How can it be that the
relatively small number of them

3
00:00:29,693 --> 00:00:34,460
which are proved have the power
the cure a rather high percentage

4
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:44,334
of all diseases? Who put this question?
Very good question.

5
00:00:47,629 --> 00:01:00,541
How long are you doing Homeopathy?
2 years? He is your son!

6
00:01:03,053 --> 00:01:04,885
That's why he put this question.

7
00:01:05,861 --> 00:01:13,855
This question is a question
of an expert Homeopath

8
00:01:14,191 --> 00:01:21,535
who has lived quite long and has
seen a lot and experienced a lot.

9
00:01:23,544 --> 00:01:26,368
Should I answer this question?

10
00:01:27,032 --> 00:01:36,299
How come that so few remedies we
have can cure so many people?

11
00:01:36,723 --> 00:01:44,539
If we claim that a remedy
is individually indicated.

12
00:01:52,787 --> 00:01:59,363
Shall I answer this question? Who
wants me to answer this question?

13
00:02:20,836 --> 00:02:25,700
This is a question which
I had many years ago.

14
00:02:29,179 --> 00:02:34,859
And I tried to find an
answer to this question.

15
00:02:42,812 --> 00:02:54,772
A question is valid when derives
from experience, not theoretical.

16
00:02:58,724 --> 00:03:05,299
Experience says that yes
we have very few remedies

17
00:03:06,499 --> 00:03:15,884
and we cure millions of
people with 500 remedies.

18
00:03:16,188 --> 00:03:24,355
How come? If we need an
absolute individualized remedy.

19
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:37,444
My answer is that I have not given
yet an answer to this question.

20
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,171
But I have some
thoughts about it.

21
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:57,037
So if you want to
hear the thoughts?

22
00:04:07,308 --> 00:04:21,190
Experience has shown that sometimes you
give a remedy, a very central remedy,

23
00:04:22,326 --> 00:04:34,462
the exact Similimum, there was a special
word defining the real Similimum

24
00:04:37,222 --> 00:04:44,389
and there is an explosion, aggravation
and then a fantastic cure.

25
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,679
Not all the cases are like that.

26
00:04:56,278 --> 00:05:04,286
My explanation for this phenomenon
is that in all the other cases

27
00:05:06,182 --> 00:05:11,934
we give a close enough
remedy to have an effect

28
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:23,286
which otherwise could exist another
remedy that would be even closer

29
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,334
and have a better effect.

30
00:05:27,982 --> 00:05:36,053
Therefore in many cases we
may have to use 3-4 remedies

31
00:05:36,765 --> 00:05:50,566
before we attain a final good
result instead of using 2 remedies

32
00:05:51,781 --> 00:05:57,493
if we had all the information of all
the possibilities of all the remedies.

33
00:06:06,198 --> 00:06:10,462
I'll take you to the
level of energy now.

34
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:27,302
It seems that all is a matter of matching
the vibrational rate of the organism.

35
00:06:27,878 --> 00:06:37,030
You want to stimulate the
vibrational rate of an organism.

36
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:47,829
The more similar a remedy is
the more the vibration is.

37
00:06:51,461 --> 00:06:58,877
You have the guitar, la, and
you have another guitar there

38
00:06:59,902 --> 00:07:16,974
and you pinch the chord and the
other guitar in la vibrates.

39
00:07:19,862 --> 00:07:50,694
So if you can imagine that there
are infinite vibrational waves

40
00:07:58,157 --> 00:08:11,630
the remedy will move this existing
by coming closer and closer

41
00:08:11,966 --> 00:08:13,838
to the vibrational rate.

42
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:30,878
So vibrational rate with one 1562
wave it can be moved by another

43
00:08:31,422 --> 00:08:42,958
with either 1252 up to 2075.

44
00:08:43,318 --> 00:08:51,653
All these vibrational energies
will touch the vibrational rate

45
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:57,221
of the organism. The closer
you get to the vibrational

46
00:08:57,694 --> 00:09:00,950
the more the reaction
of the organism is.

47
00:09:02,806 --> 00:09:11,622
If you approach very close with the
vibrational energy of the remedy

48
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:16,374
there is this big reaction.

49
00:09:17,206 --> 00:09:32,622
But the organism can be moved
within a space which is quite wide.

50
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:49,847
How do we know it? Because in a case
we prescribe the remedy on 30CH

51
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:54,310
and there is an effect.
Then there is a relapse.

52
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:58,086
You repeat and there
is a relapse.

53
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:03,269
Then you go to 200CH and you
repeat and there is a relapse.

54
00:10:03,758 --> 00:10:06,453
And you go to 1M and you
repeat, there is a relapse.

55
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:13,830
You go to 10M, you repeat, there is a
relapse, you go to 50M and remains well.

56
00:10:14,518 --> 00:10:24,046
That means all these vibrational
rates of the several potencies

57
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:33,798
were touching the vibrational
frequency of the organism

58
00:10:34,606 --> 00:10:37,557
though they were
quite far apart.

59
00:10:38,933 --> 00:10:45,773
So there is a wide range of
frequencies that are matching,

60
00:10:47,534 --> 00:11:00,710
that can be moved, stimulated.
Which country are you from?

61
00:11:04,334 --> 00:11:16,854
- During the process of healing as
the resonance frequency changes...

62
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,942
- Yes it can change.

63
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,205
Just a moment, my
answer is not complete.

64
00:11:29,525 --> 00:11:43,550
The vibrational rate of the person will
change if it has been the frequency

65
00:11:43,854 --> 00:11:50,021
that was uppermost, it has been
eliminated, completed its action

66
00:11:50,614 --> 00:11:58,102
after the repetition 3-4 potencies on
the first remedy. Then it changes.

67
00:11:58,966 --> 00:12:12,039
When we say a jump from one level
to another it is nothing else

68
00:12:12,638 --> 00:12:15,526
than the changing frequency.

69
00:12:16,222 --> 00:12:23,117
If you have an organism on
level 7, you give a remedy

70
00:12:24,261 --> 00:12:37,085
and the remedy is very close you may see
an organism had never had a high fever

71
00:12:37,598 --> 00:12:46,366
for 5-10 years developing a
high fever, even one week later

72
00:12:46,694 --> 00:12:52,174
after getting your remedy. That is
change of the vibrational frequency.

73
00:12:53,862 --> 00:13:01,365
But on another case level 7 still,
you give one remedy, changes,

74
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:06,078
you give a second remedy,
changes again the frequency,

75
00:13:06,414 --> 00:13:13,573
you give a third remedy and after the
third remedy jumps to another level.

76
00:13:14,901 --> 00:13:38,413
If you study, I think I have given this
explanation in the book A New Model.

77
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:50,165
Let us say this is level 7.

78
00:13:52,966 --> 00:14:00,830
Here is six and here is
8 and a patient comes

79
00:14:01,654 --> 00:14:09,133
when his state of health
is on this frequency here.

80
00:14:10,757 --> 00:14:20,470
That means on the lowest part of level 7.
He does not develop fevers.

81
00:14:22,534 --> 00:14:25,749
Another patient
comes on level 7,

82
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:33,485
but he comes when his organism on
the uppermost part of level 7.

83
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:44,053
This man stimulated by the correct
remedy will jump to level 6 immediately.

84
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:48,790
This here will need some work.

85
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:55,718
That means after your first remedy
you will need a second remedy

86
00:14:56,086 --> 00:15:00,653
now he has come here.
But still on level 7.

87
00:15:01,117 --> 00:15:06,357
Then you give a second remedy.
Then he goes here.

88
00:15:07,686 --> 00:15:11,790
Finally he reaches here, you
give the remedy and jumps.

89
00:15:18,213 --> 00:15:27,060
So sometimes he is here, you give
a wrong remedy and he goes there.

90
00:15:42,068 --> 00:15:43,476
It's clear.

91
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:55,708
- From what I understand how come we
have such a small number of remedies

92
00:15:56,684 --> 00:16:00,132
and infinite number of patients.

93
00:16:01,748 --> 00:16:08,923
George Vithoulkas said disease is an
inflammation of tissues of organs.

94
00:16:27,411 --> 00:16:31,131
You said that disease is
an inflammatory process.

95
00:16:33,348 --> 00:16:40,275
We are matching a remedy to the
process of pathology not the person

96
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:47,613
and the number of pathological
states is limited, not infinite.

97
00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:53,789
So we have small amounts of drugs
and small amount of pathology

98
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,766
or a derangement of
the vital force.

99
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:00,541
That's what we are matching not
the organism that is vibrating.

100
00:17:01,069 --> 00:17:04,821
It's a state of pathology
that has to be matched.

101
00:17:05,165 --> 00:17:13,525
And another thing. When you use the
analogy of the electromagnetic field,

102
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:20,053
it's not infinite. It's discreet.
That's how it is in physics.

103
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:25,101
It's not like there is an
infinite number of frequencies...

104
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:29,069
- There is not infinite
number of frequencies?<br/>- No!

105
00:17:28,851 --> 00:17:33,530
- Who said so? You?<br/>- No!
The physics!

106
00:17:36,154 --> 00:17:39,714
- Wait because we differ
with the physics.

107
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:52,211
The physics say there is no infinite
number of frequencies? Are you sure?

108
00:17:56,178 --> 00:18:04,218
- The quantum is the difference between
a frequency and another. It's discreet.

109
00:18:06,482 --> 00:18:11,730
- But one frequency
with a particular form

110
00:18:13,922 --> 00:18:22,458
and then you say there are limited
numbers of frequencies in the world...

111
00:18:26,275 --> 00:18:33,210
- For example we see the
light in about 600 nm range.

112
00:18:35,427 --> 00:18:39,770
And I don't remember exactly how
discreet the difference is.

113
00:18:41,018 --> 00:18:52,763
Say 600 or 680 I can check it it's
not 600 and 600.9 and 600.92...

114
00:19:11,635 --> 00:19:17,122
You are talking about a completely different
thing. The colors are what we perceive.

115
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:27,274
My point is there is a discreet, a
certain, limited amount of pathology

116
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:30,267
and we match that with the drug.

117
00:19:30,691 --> 00:19:40,107
- That is quite a good idea though
when we talk of pathologies

118
00:19:41,674 --> 00:19:47,762
in our sense of pathologies,
the pathologies are unlimited.

119
00:19:48,155 --> 00:19:53,514
When you speak from conventional
medicine's point of view ok

120
00:19:54,098 --> 00:19:58,642
there is a book of clinical medicine
which describes all the pathologies

121
00:19:59,274 --> 00:20:10,594
but for me when I speak on pathologies
actually as I have said many times

122
00:20:11,226 --> 00:20:15,674
you have a liver
cirrhosis, it a pathology,

123
00:20:16,234 --> 00:20:29,754
but before it the liver has started
deteriorating 20 years before.

124
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:38,425
So there is a process during
which, as far as I am concerned,

125
00:20:44,442 --> 00:20:53,715
the vibrational frequency of the organism
changes every now and then into another

126
00:20:55,874 --> 00:21:02,329
and finally reaches the pathology
which we call liver cirrhosis.

127
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:10,962
But all along from the very
moment when there is hepatitis,

128
00:21:12,698 --> 00:21:18,665
somebody is infected with
hepatitis B or C or A,

129
00:21:20,426 --> 00:21:30,987
from that moment there is a change in
the frequency of the person in general.

130
00:21:31,394 --> 00:21:40,962
Not of the liver only. And then from
that change that took place that time

131
00:21:41,314 --> 00:21:51,202
of infection continues either to
deteriorate or go back to normal.

132
00:21:53,442 --> 00:21:56,627
Because there might be a possibility
that you take a homeopathic remedy

133
00:21:57,042 --> 00:22:08,194
and you are cured. But mostly what
happens is it has started with shock,

134
00:22:10,193 --> 00:22:17,994
inflammation of the liver which ended
up after 20 years in liver cirrhosis.

135
00:22:20,738 --> 00:22:23,521
All these are series
of pathologies.

136
00:22:23,913 --> 00:22:28,945
If you catch the person instead
of coming 20 years later,

137
00:22:29,274 --> 00:22:33,978
you catch the patient 10
years after the infection,

138
00:22:35,634 --> 00:22:40,930
the vibrational frequency as far
as we are concerned is different

139
00:22:41,449 --> 00:22:49,337
than the vibrational frequency of the
final stage, in which we receive.

140
00:22:50,386 --> 00:23:06,146
Therefore the only way I can understand is
that the frequencies of the vital force,

141
00:23:06,778 --> 00:23:17,763
the vital force is the energy,
is affected quite impressively

142
00:23:19,233 --> 00:23:37,953
within a range of frequencies from substances
and this stimulation can go towards

143
00:23:38,322 --> 00:23:44,138
the right direction or sometimes it can
go towards the wrong direction as well.

144
00:23:48,466 --> 00:23:51,529
- The only explanation for
that is that the change

145
00:23:52,034 --> 00:23:58,689
in the derangement of the vital force does
not continue by little bit but is abrupt...

146
00:24:06,298 --> 00:24:11,897
- Quantum jump. The
electron changes...

147
00:24:12,649 --> 00:24:16,393
- So there are more and more
cells in the liver that died.

148
00:24:17,754 --> 00:24:24,122
But it doesn't mean they change in a
derangement of the vital force continuously.

149
00:24:25,769 --> 00:24:29,753
Then we would have needed
a zillion of remedies...

150
00:24:33,818 --> 00:24:39,366
- Let me ask another question
to the physicists who are here.

151
00:24:45,262 --> 00:24:55,382
The vibrational rate of the human
body compared to the vibrational rate

152
00:24:56,685 --> 00:25:09,230
of anything else which exists
compared to the vibrational rates

153
00:25:09,662 --> 00:25:20,334
that can be modified or
produced by human inventions...

154
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:28,814
all these what we call vibrational
rates of electromagnetic fields

155
00:25:30,134 --> 00:25:35,749
are limited or unlimited?
You say limited?

156
00:25:36,102 --> 00:25:38,046
- No I just answered
this question first.

157
00:25:38,606 --> 00:25:46,590
If you use equations of quantum mechanics
and apply to a large body of ours

158
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:52,741
the rate of the vibration is
very close to 0 as compared

159
00:25:53,069 --> 00:25:56,029
to a molecule or whatever.

160
00:25:56,622 --> 00:26:05,094
We don't really vibrate it's in
submolecular level that we vibrate.

161
00:26:07,117 --> 00:26:12,045
I accept your ideas about
vibration as far as vital force

162
00:26:12,398 --> 00:26:16,342
is concerned only as symbolic,
otherwise we can't.

163
00:26:22,286 --> 00:26:27,853
A guitar vibrates mechanically which is
a totally different kind of vibration

164
00:26:28,357 --> 00:26:33,661
from the electromagnetic. I am
not going to argue about that.

165
00:26:34,766 --> 00:26:40,950
- Ok. This is just to
conclude the question.

166
00:26:41,846 --> 00:26:46,349
This question at this moment
cannot be answered actually.

167
00:26:46,887 --> 00:26:49,910
But we have some thoughts.

168
00:26:50,574 --> 00:26:54,438
I told you my thoughts, you
have different other thoughts

169
00:26:55,254 --> 00:27:00,821
and we will see what
actually happens.

170
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:13,494
I believe the changes which
take place either a change

171
00:27:13,854 --> 00:27:21,877
towards the better or worse or
a change which is initiated

172
00:27:22,678 --> 00:27:32,311
by the intervention of the homeopathic
remedy take place in subatomic level.

173
00:27:34,358 --> 00:27:51,621
These are changes on a field which
we call the prana or the vital force

174
00:27:52,166 --> 00:28:06,950
or the level of energies. I
have some ideas about that.

175
00:28:10,677 --> 00:28:23,894
- In Organon paragraph 11 mentions there is
a spiritual mistuning of the vital force.

176
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:35,518
- That is different. We do not talk
about spirituality with that meaning.

177
00:28:35,902 --> 00:28:46,399
Here spirit-like force has not the meaning
of a religious spiritual situation.

178
00:28:48,413 --> 00:28:56,429
It has the meaning of a neutral
field that permeates everything

179
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:00,646
which exists in the Cosmos.

180
00:29:01,014 --> 00:29:10,165
It's a neutral force and through
some workings of the nature

181
00:29:11,502 --> 00:29:23,214
this force creates human forms or
any existing form we know about.

182
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:34,575
So between matter and energy,
it was Einstein who said

183
00:29:35,542 --> 00:29:44,190
and therefore we can accept, that
what exists is only fields of energy.

184
00:29:46,598 --> 00:29:55,959
The basic substance of our
existence is fields of energy

185
00:29:57,005 --> 00:30:06,077
which have been transformed into
what all the existing things are.

186
00:30:11,461 --> 00:30:25,457
If we want to enter this level of
discussion we are entering an area

187
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:34,145
which is not known even to the
most advance of the science today.

188
00:30:37,881 --> 00:30:48,073
As I was saying, whether
this change happens abruptly

189
00:30:48,569 --> 00:30:55,201
like from one millisecond
to another, it is a quantum

190
00:30:55,514 --> 00:31:00,217
jump from one state to another,
we don't know how it happens.

191
00:31:02,786 --> 00:31:10,841
I was suggesting that the electrons
that are around the nucleus

192
00:31:11,377 --> 00:31:23,209
which are turning in their own
axis, are turning in one direction

193
00:31:24,513 --> 00:31:32,754
like the earth is turning around the
sun but also turns around itself

194
00:31:33,041 --> 00:31:43,145
in a particular direction, so what
might be happening is that the moment

195
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:57,129
we become sick out of a shock the
electrons change the direction

196
00:31:57,513 --> 00:32:00,626
of turning around themselves.

197
00:32:01,993 --> 00:32:07,433
When a biological
transmutation takes place,

198
00:32:07,665 --> 00:32:24,657
that means the organism is able to
produce what is needed in the organism

199
00:32:25,265 --> 00:32:30,857
from a simple food, for instance
during the German occupation,

200
00:32:31,162 --> 00:32:38,417
when we had no money, which the German
did not feel uncomfortable with,

201
00:32:38,737 --> 00:32:43,873
we had nothing, but
when we had nothing

202
00:32:44,153 --> 00:32:50,793
we had only eating a
particular food, beans.

203
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:58,473
We were going with a cup like this,
I remember myself, 10 years,

204
00:32:59,441 --> 00:33:02,241
they put you some and
then you eat it.

205
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:13,122
These beans which did not have calcium,
the calcium was produced by the organism

206
00:33:13,434 --> 00:33:18,801
because they had a lot of magnesium,
so they got a lot of magnesium,

207
00:33:19,178 --> 00:33:25,081
transformed it to calcium and then the
organism could built up the skeleton.

208
00:33:30,921 --> 00:33:36,129
All the people are eating
that kind of food every day,

209
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:45,169
how come that one needs so much
calcium, the other needs much more,

210
00:33:45,577 --> 00:33:50,633
the other doesn't need at all,
but how all this is balanced

211
00:33:51,249 --> 00:33:54,425
though everyone eats the
same food every day.

212
00:33:54,786 --> 00:34:00,217
So something happens within the
organism which transmutes,

213
00:34:00,737 --> 00:34:08,729
it means making lead and
transmuted to gold,

214
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:15,457
this was the big
fantasy of the people.

215
00:34:16,682 --> 00:34:22,762
This transmutation can take
place in nuclear fusion.

216
00:34:23,898 --> 00:34:32,409
Then transforms uranium to energy
or to whatever is left over...

217
00:34:34,426 --> 00:34:41,780
Then under such big hit can
transmute and within the body

218
00:34:43,116 --> 00:34:50,708
then some people thought in cold fusion
that happens within the organism.

219
00:34:52,332 --> 00:34:54,292
There is some energy.

220
00:34:55,452 --> 00:35:02,755
In order to transmute uranium in to
this release of this tremendous energy

221
00:35:03,196 --> 00:35:08,612
and what is left over is
the radioactive materials.

222
00:35:11,716 --> 00:35:16,795
These rubbish they don't
know where to dump.

223
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:24,356
This is what is left out
of nuclear reactions.

224
00:35:25,924 --> 00:35:32,236
In the body the same thing
is done, nuclear reactions

225
00:35:33,228 --> 00:35:45,237
and the rubbish is the
urine and the stool.

226
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:52,859
From the nuclear
reaction in cold fusion.

227
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:59,740
What I want to say is that there are so
many things happening within the organism

228
00:36:00,229 --> 00:36:06,245
which are unbelievable for us
to perceive and to control.

229
00:36:06,908 --> 00:36:17,292
Can you say I can control my body
so it can absorb more calcium?

230
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:21,748
There is no way. The organism
will do whatever it likes.

231
00:36:22,252 --> 00:36:25,516
You give too much calcium because
you think there is not much calcium

232
00:36:25,804 --> 00:36:30,708
and because it cannot absorb it,
it poisons itself and dies.

233
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:45,699
This whole thing is so complicated
and is so complex for us

234
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:57,437
to be able to bring down to logical
information, it is very difficult, impossible.

235
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:13,028
We can have some ideas but we are very
little to understand the infinity.

236
00:37:23,812 --> 00:37:33,390
We are finite. We have a
moment of birth and of death.

237
00:37:33,678 --> 00:37:35,669
That is it, finished bye bye.

238
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:46,590
This little something which
we are... can we have an idea

239
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:50,142
that we can understand the
Cosmos and everything?

240
00:37:54,366 --> 00:37:58,902
When you enter such a field and
you really want to go inside

241
00:37:59,702 --> 00:38:06,534
then you stay in such a position
that you say Oh my God,

242
00:38:07,094 --> 00:38:12,045
there is something else that is
going on beyond our comprehension

243
00:38:13,182 --> 00:38:31,030
which is much more beyond us like
absolute knowledge, absolute existence.

244
00:38:33,854 --> 00:38:41,918
You cannot approach. That
was a very good question.

245
00:38:45,502 --> 00:38:47,973
- I would like to come to
the original question.

246
00:38:50,126 --> 00:38:54,406
Just before the first
question from Germany.

247
00:38:54,806 --> 00:39:06,230
You are talking about vibration of
the substances and then draw the...

248
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:11,814
being vibrational pathology
of the human body,

249
00:39:13,118 --> 00:39:18,878
what I don't understand is that
we can use one remedy in level 7

250
00:39:19,263 --> 00:39:27,382
and we can use the same remedy in
level 1, there will be a change...

251
00:39:32,902 --> 00:39:40,574
- The same remedy will have a
different effect on every level.

252
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:50,310
Depending on what Hahnemann,
will bring the idea later on,

253
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:55,278
of the miasmatic
predisposition of the person.

254
00:39:57,038 --> 00:40:01,222
If the miasmatic
predisposition is deep,

255
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:09,262
that means you come from a generation
of people who had a lot of syphilis,

256
00:40:10,694 --> 00:40:25,614
gonorrhea, scabies, lepra, you
come from a heavy tradition

257
00:40:26,134 --> 00:40:31,334
and then you have epilepsy.

258
00:40:31,814 --> 00:40:37,918
What you see as level
7 here is epilepsy.

259
00:40:41,718 --> 00:40:47,141
Needs the first remedy which will
reduce the effect of epilepsy.

260
00:40:48,614 --> 00:40:54,438
Number 2 will reduce it even
more, number 3 will reduce it.

261
00:40:54,806 --> 00:41:09,702
How was this epilepsy created? Because
the ancestors had skin eruption

262
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:18,959
that was suppressed and this
suppression went quite deep

263
00:41:20,046 --> 00:41:26,373
and created a situation where
we say has a psoric miasm

264
00:41:27,414 --> 00:41:38,943
and together with the syphilis
3-4-5 generation before,

265
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:44,582
together with gonorrhea that
was 2 generations before,

266
00:41:46,142 --> 00:41:52,694
this suppressed eruption is now
coming as a form of epilepsy

267
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:59,077
which is going to be
difficult to be treated.

268
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:06,230
It really needs an expert
to unravel all that.

269
00:42:07,366 --> 00:42:14,022
Because if you don't follow the
right direction that means here

270
00:42:15,462 --> 00:42:22,814
when I say number 1 ,2 and 3
, I mean 3 correct remedies.

271
00:42:23,286 --> 00:42:30,302
But what happens in real life, here
you have the first correct remedy,

272
00:42:30,854 --> 00:42:35,949
the epilepsy stopped happening every
week, and will be once a month.

273
00:42:38,174 --> 00:42:47,015
You prescribe once a month and you create
some confusion here, wrong remedies.

274
00:42:49,782 --> 00:42:53,702
How can you come to the
next correct remedy?

275
00:42:53,966 --> 00:42:58,718
If you prescribe 3-4-5
incorrect remedies.

276
00:43:03,422 --> 00:43:14,358
Again there is some expert homeopath
who realizes the number 2 remedy

277
00:43:14,646 --> 00:43:19,174
that you need. Then gives a further
boost and goes to number 3.

278
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:30,126
Again here wrong remedies... confusion.
Before you can get out of that.

279
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:46,366
What you say is in level
1, you can have epilepsy.

280
00:43:49,806 --> 00:43:58,910
Due to stress the person can
go to epilepsy as well.

281
00:43:59,493 --> 00:44:07,758
He has a very good predisposition a very
good organism coming from his parents.

282
00:44:10,598 --> 00:44:19,478
This person with one remedy will
be cured from his epilepsy.

283
00:44:20,286 --> 00:44:25,926
With the same remedy this one
just managed to go here.

284
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:30,406
Same remedy is given
Calcarea Carbonica.

285
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:53,070
That is why the Indians who are very
excited when they have a case cured

286
00:44:55,086 --> 00:45:06,023
shout "we cure epilepsy!" You can
cure epilepsy of level 1 to 3.

287
00:45:06,526 --> 00:45:10,053
You do not cure epilepsy
which is of level 7 or 8.

288
00:45:11,231 --> 00:45:17,894
Not so easy, you may also cure this but it
is going to be another story altogether.

289
00:45:18,238 --> 00:45:29,749
You cannot say we cure cancer. You
cure a cancer and yet their health

290
00:45:30,286 --> 00:45:35,854
is currently in the first group,
level 1-2-3 and they get cancer.

291
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:44,445
Then they take 1 or 2 remedies and the
cancer is cured. So they get so excited.

292
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:49,406
But when it comes to the point you
where you have a heavy predisposition

293
00:45:50,118 --> 00:45:52,510
then it is a different story.

294
00:45:56,286 --> 00:46:06,958
Generations of syphilis... As I said there
was hair... how much hair they had.

295
00:46:10,758 --> 00:46:25,006
It means they are free of syphilis,
in a huge scale. Easier cases.

296
00:46:27,742 --> 00:46:30,158
It is not a joke but a fact.

297
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:42,788
Kent mentions this that syphilis
except of the other known pathology

298
00:46:43,364 --> 00:46:53,684
which creates, like the
syphilis in the skin

299
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:59,300
then it goes deeper in the nervous
system, the neurosyphilis etc.,

300
00:47:01,348 --> 00:47:07,236
creates to the next generations
falling of hair and alcoholism.

301
00:47:08,605 --> 00:47:13,564
The tendency to alcoholism
and the falling of hair.

302
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:21,868
He had noticed for instance Syphilinum
to some people that as a reaction

303
00:47:22,148 --> 00:47:29,476
that they had falling of their hair.
He describes all that and it is true.

304
00:47:30,884 --> 00:47:39,812
People whom you see
with baldness indicate

305
00:47:44,085 --> 00:47:51,764
that there is most probably a
heavy effect from syphilis.

306
00:47:54,332 --> 00:48:05,284
That is why most of the people of the
west, especially English people,

307
00:48:06,892 --> 00:48:18,773
who are bald, because they
practice sexual excesses etc.

308
00:48:19,973 --> 00:48:28,044
But the Indians who were occupied by the
English were not coming near the English

309
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,236
because they had strong ethics.

310
00:48:32,748 --> 00:48:37,123
They stayed together to their
families, they were protected.

311
00:48:37,597 --> 00:48:53,101
Some Indian prostitutes were giving
syphilis to a lot of English soldiers.

312
00:48:55,548 --> 00:49:02,501
This was the punishment of
the English occupying India.

313
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:06,556
Nobody actually knew
what was taking place,

314
00:49:07,156 --> 00:49:16,308
but it was a punishment of the English
occupying force that all of them

315
00:49:16,668 --> 00:49:22,460
came back to England with syphilis.
Treated with mercury etc.

316
00:49:26,164 --> 00:49:31,723
Then you see all the distortions of
the syphilis in the mental sphere

317
00:49:33,605 --> 00:49:45,237
because if you see people
thinking that we should go to war

318
00:49:45,636 --> 00:49:51,099
and kill each other and
all that... Is this normal?

319
00:49:53,356 --> 00:49:59,700
- I was thinking how sociopathic most of
the western presidents and everybody is.

320
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:08,755
That is syphilitic miasm? The Americans for
example are constantly at war with everyone.

321
00:50:09,292 --> 00:50:14,700
- It is not only syphilitic
miasm but a mixture of miasms.

322
00:50:16,076 --> 00:50:26,084
At this moment the West in general
are affected by a mixture miasms

323
00:50:27,636 --> 00:50:33,812
and also together
with vaccinations

324
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:52,220
that have deeply affected the human race.
We just witnessed an action of cruelness.

325
00:51:06,613 --> 00:51:18,180
I see in the western population great
difficulties in bringing back health.

326
00:51:27,516 --> 00:51:35,443
The races that are going to control
eventually will be South Americans

327
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:47,597
and Asian races, Indians,
Pakistanis, Turks.

328
00:51:48,645 --> 00:52:05,941
Turkey is coming with a lot of
punishment, with drugs and vaccinations.

329
00:52:06,636 --> 00:52:07,971
You will get it.

330
00:52:20,676 --> 00:52:27,523
- From your explanation Calcarea
in lower level 7 comes together

331
00:52:27,908 --> 00:52:35,925
with a lot of noises then it will
be the next remedy number 2, 3.

332
00:52:36,348 --> 00:52:39,988
While in level 1
Calcarea is pure.

333
00:52:40,876 --> 00:52:48,043
Can we say that coming up to level 1
of health we actually come closer

334
00:52:48,476 --> 00:52:54,452
to the pure resonance? That
means when we find the remedy

335
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:59,012
that it matches with the person.

336
00:53:01,068 --> 00:53:06,516
Can we say that the remedy one
level 1 is actually a remedy

337
00:53:07,308 --> 00:53:11,860
that characterizes a person
and we come very close ...?

338
00:53:12,956 --> 00:53:19,515
- We say this person has a clear
remedy picture of Sulphur, Phosphorus,

339
00:53:20,044 --> 00:53:27,836
once you see this, it is the greatest
luck for the patient and doctor.

340
00:53:28,484 --> 00:53:33,940
But in this case, Calcarea
Carbonica or Phosphorus

341
00:53:34,813 --> 00:53:39,572
will be in-between the
different other remedies.

342
00:53:40,284 --> 00:53:47,124
You will have to analyze very well
to understand not a Calcarea,

343
00:53:47,556 --> 00:53:55,108
not an Arsenicum, not a Lycopodium, not
a Phosphorus. But it will look like.

344
00:53:56,028 --> 00:53:58,388
I get Calcarea carbonica
or this or that remedy

345
00:53:59,276 --> 00:54:06,372
and then you have to analyze correctly
and to prescribe to have the effect.

346
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:09,145
- I have a paradox in my mind.

347
00:54:09,449 --> 00:54:13,833
If we come very close in level
1 to the pure resonance

348
00:54:15,273 --> 00:54:20,528
wouldn't we close very close to
the infinity of our differences

349
00:54:21,944 --> 00:54:26,361
and we should see level 1 to
the infinity of who we are?

350
00:54:26,737 --> 00:54:32,033
We are so different one from each other
and there are all these substances

351
00:54:32,729 --> 00:54:38,784
that could be used... But still
in level 1 we see limited...

352
00:54:39,728 --> 00:54:44,416
Calcarea, Sulphur... Very healthy.

353
00:54:46,025 --> 00:54:51,201
- Why don't we see peculiar
remedies in the uppermost levels?

354
00:54:51,665 --> 00:54:59,112
- Why don't we see a big variety?
- There must be a reason.

355
00:55:00,932 --> 00:55:08,997
I don't know the reason. I can give
you some answer but I don't know.

356
00:55:09,717 --> 00:55:24,773
The reason is that the
basic miasm is the psoric.

357
00:55:26,157 --> 00:55:32,172
What is the psoric? Suppressed
scabies, originally.

358
00:55:33,348 --> 00:55:43,340
What does it do? It has an effect
upon the skeleton primarily.

359
00:55:43,901 --> 00:55:49,492
Upon the skeleton means upon
the absorption of calcium.

360
00:55:52,876 --> 00:56:01,395
So whatever remedies are connected
with absorption of calcium

361
00:56:02,837 --> 00:56:05,116
will be the basic remedies.

362
00:56:08,348 --> 00:56:16,629
Calcarea carbonica, maybe Magnesias,
Ferrum, some other remedies

363
00:56:17,029 --> 00:56:24,868
which are concerned... as I said
before transmutation takes place

364
00:56:26,084 --> 00:56:34,172
with beans every day which
contain a lot of Ferrum,

365
00:56:34,757 --> 00:56:42,805
the organisms transmutes Ferrum in
to Calcium. That is why I think.

366
00:56:43,813 --> 00:56:52,300
We come back to the basic minerals
of the body which are needed.

367
00:56:53,341 --> 00:56:59,613
The 12 tissue salts. Silica, Calcarea
Carbonica, Calcarea fluorica,

368
00:56:59,988 --> 00:57:04,388
Calcarea phosphorica,
Magnesia phosphorica etc.

369
00:57:08,453 --> 00:57:18,092
These are the main remedies
that we will finally need.

370
00:57:19,444 --> 00:57:34,020
But I will tell you something that
even if you arrive at that stage

371
00:57:34,445 --> 00:57:45,805
where you feel really good and you have
a person who is happy, full of life,

372
00:57:46,341 --> 00:57:55,357
full of energy, who enjoys
life, such a person

373
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:02,740
should have the best
possibility for living long.

374
00:58:04,988 --> 00:58:09,557
200 years.
300 years.

375
00:58:10,053 --> 00:58:17,229
What doesn't he live long? Because
he has a choice all the time.

376
00:58:18,477 --> 00:58:21,597
All the moment in his
life will have a choice

377
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:25,404
and the choice will
be shall I do this?

378
00:58:27,308 --> 00:58:34,748
Not good, don't do it says the conscience.
But I am attracted.

379
00:58:35,181 --> 00:58:44,717
So by choosing the actions
brings back disease.

380
00:58:46,876 --> 00:58:56,133
Eventually the possibility which
a person had to live 120 years

381
00:58:57,613 --> 00:59:05,076
comes down to 75 where he
says goodbye to the world.

382
00:59:05,524 --> 00:59:11,540
Though very good and healthy people
that enjoyed life very much.

383
00:59:18,844 --> 00:59:29,701
The choice that we are given
to do good or bad is ours

384
00:59:31,133 --> 00:59:36,476
so we do whatever we like.
We live longer or shorter.

385
00:59:43,452 --> 00:59:51,507
Here is Homeopathy for those who are
not so lucky as to be in level 1

386
00:59:52,068 --> 01:00:00,436
that always supports... ok live
one more year... take the remedy.

387
01:00:07,005 --> 01:00:11,492
- I would like to ask a question
about what you explained before.

388
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:14,604
I am also stuck to the
figure on the board.

389
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:21,796
There is the case on
level 7 who has epilepsy

390
01:00:22,205 --> 01:00:26,388
because a lot of ancestors had
suppressions. This is easy to understand.

391
01:00:28,612 --> 01:00:34,972
In the first group it's logic there can
be a case with the same pathology.

392
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,620
Also convulsions and so on.

393
01:00:37,052 --> 01:00:40,836
But comes from
healthy ancestors.

394
01:00:42,188 --> 01:00:53,701
How can such a child be born
without the severe predisposition?

395
01:01:00,252 --> 01:01:10,868
- How can somebody be born healthy if
today we have gone through all these?

396
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:17,684
I don't believe that anybody which is
born in the western world is healthy,

397
01:01:18,381 --> 01:01:19,756
to tell you the truth.

398
01:01:20,796 --> 01:01:25,948
- Let's say hypothetical case who is
really healthy, let's say in India,

399
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:34,446
they had healthy ancestors. In group 1
still develop epilepsy but without injury.

400
01:01:36,583 --> 01:01:39,974
Where does this
predisposition come from?

401
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:48,734
- Where does a predisposition of healthy
individuals come from in Group 1?

402
01:01:49,759 --> 01:01:52,447
I'll tell you something.

403
01:01:59,078 --> 01:02:07,186
In the North America, the
red Indians were living.

404
01:02:09,394 --> 01:02:26,882
They were eliminated by the Europeans
transferring to them the TB, disease etc.

405
01:02:32,723 --> 01:02:38,730
From this example we can understand
what actually is happening.

406
01:02:39,171 --> 01:02:52,250
That means in an environment which
is unhealthy any healthy individual

407
01:02:52,891 --> 01:02:58,418
can be affected
to a deep degree.

408
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:11,658
Because the immune system has
not learned to face situations

409
01:03:12,538 --> 01:03:19,202
which are very
pathological, inimical.

410
01:03:20,507 --> 01:03:30,883
Therefore if you bring somebody from
a family life with all the love,

411
01:03:32,474 --> 01:03:45,922
all the good things which happen in a
nice environment which is full of love,

412
01:03:48,362 --> 01:03:58,819
and you put him into a society
in which he feels alien,

413
01:04:03,131 --> 01:04:15,515
this person is going to develop all kinds
of diseases without predisposition.

414
01:04:16,843 --> 01:04:20,482
- It's not the disposition.
It's an acquired disease.

415
01:04:20,842 --> 01:04:25,322
- Before I answer this question
I have to tell you also this.

416
01:04:28,091 --> 01:04:39,298
In case an individual is coming
to you with a psychological state

417
01:04:39,922 --> 01:04:45,338
which is quite pathological though you
cannot understand it at the moment.

418
01:04:45,770 --> 01:04:57,826
He has depression, different mental/
emotional problems and he is in level 8.

419
01:04:58,306 --> 01:05:02,058
But on the uppermost level.

420
01:05:06,571 --> 01:05:18,747
You give a remedy and while he is coming
back in his psychological condition,

421
01:05:19,946 --> 01:05:30,882
he develops epilepsy. And from there
on you have to continue to treat

422
01:05:31,474 --> 01:05:34,042
in order to take him out.

423
01:05:35,450 --> 01:05:48,115
You may give sometimes a remedy and while
the mental condition is better there

424
01:05:48,426 --> 01:05:54,090
appears a pathology
which is in unexpected.

425
01:05:54,770 --> 01:05:58,850
It comes from the predisposition
because he was in level 8

426
01:05:59,275 --> 01:06:04,618
when he had the depression. He
was not on level 1 or 2 or 3.

427
01:06:23,595 --> 01:06:30,427
- I have 2 questions. I have not
actually understood what do you mean

428
01:06:30,890 --> 01:06:36,338
by unhealthy people in the west because
here I see people who are very happy,

429
01:06:41,426 --> 01:06:47,346
nobody is depressed, I don't
understand what do you mean by that!

430
01:06:51,515 --> 01:06:59,971
- You live constantly in
a happy state, in bliss.

431
01:07:04,098 --> 01:07:08,154
Do you really live in
another world from us?

432
01:07:09,875 --> 01:07:13,546
Her eyes are full of
energy and happiness.

433
01:07:14,498 --> 01:07:24,219
What are you talking about? Of
course you don't understand

434
01:07:24,546 --> 01:07:32,089
because in India it is a fact most
of the pathology is physical.

435
01:07:35,791 --> 01:07:39,175
I remember when I was
in India I was asking

436
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:43,399
and they didn't even
understand what I was asking.

437
01:07:44,095 --> 01:07:48,927
Life is so simple, we love each other,
we are happy, we live together.

438
01:07:50,919 --> 01:07:54,600
They don't even
understand what we mean.

439
01:07:55,640 --> 01:08:01,353
What we mean is something we
experience because of predisposition.

440
01:08:02,136 --> 01:08:10,144
We are coming through ancestors
who had syphilis, gonorrhea, TB

441
01:08:11,304 --> 01:08:20,849
and the pathology went through from
different levels into the deepest part

442
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:27,911
which is the brain. You
are happy, stay happy!

443
01:08:32,833 --> 01:08:38,624
- One more regarding
predisposition.

444
01:08:40,128 --> 01:08:42,335
I'll ask with an example.

445
01:08:43,663 --> 01:08:48,263
Suppose in my family none
had history of diabetes

446
01:08:48,824 --> 01:08:55,992
and my father was the first to get diabetes
at the age of 36 after I was born.

447
01:08:56,824 --> 01:09:00,463
Will I get the predisposition
of diabetes or not?

448
01:09:00,935 --> 01:09:02,583
- Yes.

449
01:09:03,264 --> 01:09:06,016
- But he got it after I was born
and no history of diabetes.

450
01:09:06,424 --> 01:09:07,896
- It doesn't matter.

451
01:09:08,344 --> 01:09:13,576
What it means is that your father had
a predisposition to get diabetes.

452
01:09:14,088 --> 01:09:22,296
Diabetes is a disease of
influent people, who are rich,

453
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,024
have enough to eat and
actually overeat.

454
01:09:27,336 --> 01:09:36,664
I remember when I was in India back in the
1960s most of the people were so thin

455
01:09:37,496 --> 01:09:44,557
and if somebody was little bit fat,
it was considered a great beauty.

456
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:53,436
So everybody wanted to marry a
woman who was a little bit fat.

457
01:09:54,052 --> 01:09:58,051
That was the model by that time.

458
01:09:58,899 --> 01:10:06,595
Now diabetes comes because
you eat too much sweets

459
01:10:07,468 --> 01:10:15,827
and eventually there is diabetes and the
diabetes is going to be transferred

460
01:10:16,827 --> 01:10:24,003
to the new generation.
Be careful!

461
01:10:30,892 --> 01:10:33,507
- You are talking
about predisposition.

462
01:10:34,259 --> 01:10:38,291
What is different between
predisposition and miasm?

463
01:10:39,524 --> 01:10:43,229
- Miasm creates predisposition.

464
01:10:43,836 --> 01:10:47,892
It is the miasm that creates it.

465
01:10:49,436 --> 01:10:53,995
One miasm which creates a certain
predisposition for certain diseases.

466
01:10:54,940 --> 01:11:00,308
You had 2 miasms you have more
predisposition for more disease.

467
01:11:00,756 --> 01:11:02,940
3 miasms even more.

468
01:11:04,508 --> 01:11:10,243
To what degree you have
this miasm in your body

469
01:11:11,076 --> 01:11:16,588
it will be shown in the
manifestation of the pathology

470
01:11:17,028 --> 01:11:20,524
whether it will be
malignant or not.

471
01:11:23,948 --> 01:11:34,420
A lot predisposition for syphilis,
that means your father had syphilis

472
01:11:34,884 --> 01:11:43,571
or your grandfather, will
be in the nervous system.

473
01:11:47,828 --> 01:11:58,893
If you had gonorrhea it will be on
producing tumors, explosions, condylomata

474
01:12:02,011 --> 01:12:09,563
and in general tumors which are manifesting
if the predisposition is close.

475
01:12:09,996 --> 01:12:15,220
So you have a predisposition of
syphilis out of 5 generations behind,

476
01:12:15,788 --> 01:12:24,725
a predisposition of psora 10 generation
behind and a predisposition of sycosis

477
01:12:25,516 --> 01:12:34,237
one generation behind then most probably
the first manifestation will be tumors.

478
01:12:43,484 --> 01:12:45,900
- One comment on the
diabetes issue.

479
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:50,252
There is a new kind of diabetes
in India in particular

480
01:12:50,636 --> 01:12:56,243
where thin people do get diabetes and
it is very tricky kind of diabetes

481
01:12:56,724 --> 01:13:09,149
because it is hidden in thin people and
people who, when their mothers were pregnant

482
01:13:09,436 --> 01:13:14,699
and they didn't have all the
nutrients it's a paradox

483
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:20,412
the children got diabetes, it's not
because of overindulgence to excess food.

484
01:13:21,836 --> 01:13:25,061
That is one comment on that. It's
a little bit more complicated

485
01:13:25,429 --> 01:13:30,493
but I have one question regarding the
predisposition in families with many children

486
01:13:31,173 --> 01:13:37,829
where the parents have the same
predispositions themselves and they have...

487
01:13:38,278 --> 01:13:43,645
- Wait a moment. In a family of
5 children the predisposition

488
01:13:44,021 --> 01:13:49,285
is not going to be equal for everyone.
It is going to be different.

489
01:13:49,910 --> 01:13:58,421
We say predisposition and we
get a general idea but in fact

490
01:13:59,565 --> 01:14:07,821
when a baby is conceived depending
on the state of the parents

491
01:14:09,670 --> 01:14:19,463
the predisposition will be better or worse
according to the state of the 2 parents

492
01:14:20,165 --> 01:14:25,645
when the conception took place.
- I was expecting this answer.

493
01:14:26,054 --> 01:14:31,558
- So one child is diabetic and
the second child has no problem.

494
01:14:32,453 --> 01:14:36,693
- You have commented in your book
that the children who come from love

495
01:14:38,189 --> 01:14:43,253
they have the biggest potential
to become healthy people.

496
01:14:44,486 --> 01:14:51,773
But there are children conceived from
parents who really wanted to have a child,

497
01:14:52,917 --> 01:14:58,181
were really in love with each other
and had a very bad genetic syndrome

498
01:15:00,390 --> 01:15:05,654
and when they were born they couldn't
live or the mother had a miscarriage

499
01:15:06,038 --> 01:15:09,077
because of this very
strong syndrome.

500
01:15:09,781 --> 01:15:13,605
After that they may have had
other kids which were normal.

501
01:15:14,862 --> 01:15:20,421
There are the same set of genes
and predisposition from a couple

502
01:15:20,998 --> 01:15:23,894
who love each other a lot but...

503
01:15:25,278 --> 01:15:31,429
- I am sorry I have not been
able to conceive your question.

504
01:15:33,237 --> 01:15:35,173
Can you make it more concrete?

505
01:15:36,574 --> 01:15:41,870
- Why a couple who love
each other have a child...

506
01:15:42,957 --> 01:15:45,829
- Which is sick and
another which is not.

507
01:15:46,909 --> 01:15:48,821
- They love each
other all the time.

508
01:15:54,574 --> 01:15:59,958
- If 2 people who are married
and they love each other

509
01:16:00,741 --> 01:16:07,821
and they continue to love each other
why one child is not so healthy

510
01:16:08,647 --> 01:16:11,079
and the other is? Is
that the question?

511
01:16:37,071 --> 01:16:55,304
I'll tell you something. What I
mean when I say in love is this.

512
01:16:57,272 --> 01:17:08,393
When 2 people meet and they become
infatuated in a relationship

513
01:17:10,017 --> 01:17:25,513
in which they feel I have found the right
person that moment is a special moment

514
01:17:26,801 --> 01:17:36,281
which has special meaning for both
of them and gives them a feeling

515
01:17:37,889 --> 01:17:45,720
of great completeness
when they are together.

516
01:17:46,368 --> 01:17:50,968
So this feeling of completeness
when they are together,

517
01:17:51,377 --> 01:17:59,546
that means I don't need anything once I
am with you I feel I don't need anything.

518
01:18:00,025 --> 01:18:02,984
The whole world
is under my feet.

519
01:18:03,648 --> 01:18:13,017
That is a state of love which
comes only unfortunately once.

520
01:18:16,745 --> 01:18:20,177
I will explain more.

521
01:18:27,825 --> 01:18:37,745
That situation in which you felt that
that everything you wanted in life

522
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:44,520
has been fulfilled
through this contact,

523
01:18:46,361 --> 01:18:51,409
this completeness is going
to produce a complete child.

524
01:18:52,809 --> 01:19:00,808
That child is going to get all the
best genes of you and your partner.

525
01:19:02,185 --> 01:19:07,201
Because by the moment you
are in that exalted state

526
01:19:07,809 --> 01:19:15,808
all the cells perceive this completeness.
They become complete.

527
01:19:17,752 --> 01:19:27,465
It means all the elements and the
structures are in complete harmony.

528
01:19:27,849 --> 01:19:32,952
The child which is going to be born it is
going to be a child which feels complete.

529
01:19:33,368 --> 01:19:58,859
That child will be happy. Will not be
ambitious, a scientist of great attainment.

530
01:20:00,331 --> 01:20:05,771
He is not interested because he has the
completeness inside, the happiness.

531
01:20:06,859 --> 01:20:09,619
The child will be like this.

532
01:20:10,708 --> 01:20:15,283
What is going to happen later on with
life whether the child will meet

533
01:20:16,043 --> 01:20:27,500
with an equal child... The
real question starts here.

534
01:20:27,844 --> 01:20:30,644
If I continue to be in
love with my husband

535
01:20:31,604 --> 01:20:35,995
why my second child was not
as good as the first one?

536
01:20:36,907 --> 01:20:53,453
Because the people who are really in
love for the first time it is something

537
01:20:54,027 --> 01:21:01,283
which is so powerful that nothing
can be compared with that

538
01:21:01,804 --> 01:21:14,325
and the only thing that can compare this
state is the state of the saint people

539
01:21:15,115 --> 01:21:19,643
in certain moments in the
effort to approach God

540
01:21:20,132 --> 01:21:27,211
where the click is made and they say my God
now I feel full of absolute knowledge,

541
01:21:28,355 --> 01:21:32,555
existence, bliss, complete.

542
01:21:33,099 --> 01:21:44,139
That state comes only once and it
is given only to young people.

543
01:21:46,755 --> 01:21:58,460
Young people can have the power and they
should have also the cultural background

544
01:21:59,747 --> 01:22:07,299
to wait until they found
their real partner.

545
01:22:07,779 --> 01:22:13,107
If they did not wait they
want to try to experiment

546
01:22:13,716 --> 01:22:17,635
and to have another
partner... it's finished.

547
01:22:18,907 --> 01:22:23,835
They can never come to
that state of love.

548
01:22:24,707 --> 01:22:31,451
The moment they indulge in a lot of
partners forget about that situation.

549
01:22:31,828 --> 01:22:36,419
The child is going to be
born with limitations.

550
01:22:38,379 --> 01:22:43,043
I come back to the case where
you are still in love.

551
01:22:43,555 --> 01:22:46,411
You think you are still in love.

552
01:22:48,132 --> 01:22:57,420
The first time of two
people being in love

553
01:22:58,371 --> 01:23:05,603
and having sex unprotected in having
a child, that is very rare today,

554
01:23:12,331 --> 01:23:27,579
that child is going to be
a child of love, wisdom,

555
01:23:30,707 --> 01:23:36,947
a child who has everything.
Except from ambition.

556
01:23:37,627 --> 01:23:47,795
I want to become
a scientist etc.

557
01:23:48,227 --> 01:23:54,803
They are complete and whatever
they do they do it in moderation.

558
01:23:56,564 --> 01:24:03,763
Now you feel you are still in love but
you are not in that exciting state.

559
01:24:06,043 --> 01:24:09,443
It has fallen quite a lot.

560
01:24:09,891 --> 01:24:18,970
In the second conception the
child starts having limitation.

561
01:24:20,107 --> 01:24:29,419
That child will become ambitious,
jealous, will have limitations.

562
01:24:30,187 --> 01:24:39,747
Will try to catch up because
it's absolutely impossible.

563
01:24:40,482 --> 01:24:51,275
This is a law of nature in order
to rejuvenate the human race

564
01:24:52,266 --> 01:24:59,338
and to make possible to the human
to reach spiritually higher states.

565
01:25:03,450 --> 01:25:10,305
Whoever has arranged that says if you
wait and you meet the right partner

566
01:25:12,139 --> 01:25:18,978
then your child will be in
better health than you.

567
01:25:20,530 --> 01:25:23,514
Because the child that will
be born under this condition

568
01:25:23,963 --> 01:25:27,915
will be healthier
than the parent.

569
01:25:28,282 --> 01:25:34,674
So you can imagine if that
continues then we have a new race

570
01:25:35,490 --> 01:25:39,962
which is going to be
another type of people.

571
01:25:40,459 --> 01:25:45,474
Full of love, they can never
become generals, kill people.

572
01:25:48,674 --> 01:25:53,962
Simple people but at
the same time wise.

573
01:25:54,938 --> 01:25:58,106
The have love and
wisdom together.

574
01:26:00,122 --> 01:26:06,178
Can these people become
general who has to kill?

575
01:26:07,538 --> 01:26:12,778
Can these people become scientists
who manipulate the virus

576
01:26:13,314 --> 01:26:21,251
so he can send it over to eliminate a
few millions of people? Of course not!

577
01:26:22,154 --> 01:26:26,450
These people will never
become prominent in society.

578
01:26:28,602 --> 01:26:38,194
And this is the way that regeneration
of the human race can take place.

579
01:26:38,674 --> 01:26:47,050
That means the children of
love should stay alive.

580
01:26:47,442 --> 01:26:57,282
Today the children of love are aborted.
You are too young to have a child.

581
01:26:58,418 --> 01:27:05,330
Out! First abortion, second
abortion, after the third abortion

582
01:27:05,794 --> 01:27:10,169
I cannot have a child anymore.
Go to a homeopath!

583
01:27:11,922 --> 01:27:31,155
She told I have 500 sterile women... 400
women with sterility cannot have a child

584
01:27:32,003 --> 01:27:38,562
because most of them they would
have abortions one after another.

585
01:27:48,122 --> 01:27:50,306
And the endometrium
is destroyed.

586
01:27:52,938 --> 01:27:56,450
It's the worst thing that
can happen to a woman.

587
01:27:58,346 --> 01:28:13,210
What I mean by real love, completeness is
very difficult thing to happen really.

588
01:28:16,242 --> 01:28:19,465
Very seldom. Very lucky people.

589
01:28:22,850 --> 01:28:34,635
The man is 25 still he could control
his urges he did not go out

590
01:28:35,635 --> 01:28:45,787
and play around and the woman the
same she is 21-22 they meet suddenly

591
01:28:46,394 --> 01:28:55,602
there is explosion and the best genes are
transferred to the young generation.

592
01:28:55,962 --> 01:29:05,619
One time, second a little bit less, the
third after 5 years of marriage... less.

593
01:29:09,098 --> 01:29:15,025
In 7 years of
marriage is goodbye!

594
01:29:16,986 --> 01:29:20,418
Still the love is there,
of course you care,

595
01:29:25,954 --> 01:29:37,146
but what is missing is the spark that
made that magic thing come into reality.
