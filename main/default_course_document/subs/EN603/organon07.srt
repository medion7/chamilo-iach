1
00:00:15,703 --> 00:00:20,801
Here I have a question because
I spoke about hydrogen

2
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:31,304
and somebody write here what about North
Pole, South Pole, electricity, x-ray etc...?

3
00:00:35,504 --> 00:00:51,100
It is true that in M.M. there are supposed
to be provings of North Pole and South Pole.

4
00:00:52,902 --> 00:01:01,604
I consider them as
totally... wrong.

5
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:11,805
There is no question that we
cannot have any provings.

6
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:35,204
Hahnemann by himself... I don't know what
he meant and how this came to the M.M.

7
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:44,804
but it is not possible to have a
proving of the electromagnetic field

8
00:01:45,701 --> 00:01:50,802
of the South or North Pole.
It doesn't matter what.

9
00:01:53,204 --> 00:02:04,302
When a man has to do so much as Hahnemann
it's possible that he gives some information

10
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:14,004
which come from one of
his students or friends.

11
00:02:15,203 --> 00:02:26,004
He incorporates but it is not
possible under any circumstances

12
00:02:27,201 --> 00:02:36,800
that there can be a proving of the
electromagnetic field of South or North Pole.

13
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:45,201
Also Luna is in the M.M.
What is the proving of Luna?

14
00:02:47,301 --> 00:03:03,805
Somebody was lying under the light of the
Luna for several nights. He became lunatic!

15
00:03:06,108 --> 00:03:15,709
What else can I say? Am I to prove Luna
and to say these are the symptoms of Luna

16
00:03:16,311 --> 00:03:21,408
and if somebody has these symptoms
you give Luna? It is lunatic!

17
00:03:22,008 --> 00:03:27,710
It is a matter of you being out
of your mind! This is a science.

18
00:03:28,311 --> 00:03:36,410
Of course people have great imagination
and their imagination is creative

19
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:44,811
and I understand all that but logic
also should prevail in our science.

20
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:50,509
Otherwise it is not going to be
accepted from anybody as science.

21
00:03:50,807 --> 00:03:53,211
Because many times
people have said that.

22
00:03:54,108 --> 00:04:07,011
How did you prove South Pole, Luna?
I said I did not prove it myself.

23
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:11,811
Some lunatics have proved it.

24
00:04:19,908 --> 00:04:24,411
Do you believe that there is
somebody else living today

25
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:31,611
that believes more in what Hahnemann
has said, done or taught than me?

26
00:04:33,411 --> 00:04:35,810
I don't believe
there is anybody.

27
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:50,510
If I who have seen applied all what
Hahnemann said and there are some point

28
00:04:51,109 --> 00:04:55,607
to which I do not agree not
because I don't like it but

29
00:04:55,909 --> 00:05:07,608
because experience had shown to me that.
Maybe I have seen much more cases than him.

30
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:19,609
It's natural because I practice more years
than him and I had a group of doctors.

31
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,507
I was getting a lot
of information.

32
00:05:24,711 --> 00:05:31,612
If my information is such that is
contrary to what he says I have to tell.

33
00:05:33,111 --> 00:05:39,408
Like this. South, North Pole etc.
Don't believe.

34
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,310
I will tell you the truth.

35
00:05:45,409 --> 00:06:01,308
Before I said this many years ago when I had a
case where it showed the absolute symptoms,

36
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:07,308
it was a clear case, in spite of
logic I will give this remedy

37
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:15,408
because it looks so similar to what is
written in the books, so I gave the remedy

38
00:06:16,608 --> 00:06:19,007
but there was almost no effect.
Came back.

39
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:23,208
Then I gave another remedy and
of course there was a cure.

40
00:06:23,807 --> 00:06:30,707
But at a certain point I
tried it, against my logic.

41
00:06:40,308 --> 00:06:48,409
There was a dispute because I criticized
these things with some other homeopaths.

42
00:06:49,010 --> 00:07:02,211
So in the Journal "Links" it was written that
after all we don't have to prove a remedy,

43
00:07:03,111 --> 00:07:08,508
we have to write the name of the
remedy with a glass of water over it,

44
00:07:09,109 --> 00:07:14,210
leave it 10 minutes and then drink
it and then it is Lycopodium 10M.

45
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,508
You wrote Lycopodium 10M,
you drink Lycopodium 10M.

46
00:07:19,911 --> 00:07:27,408
This is going as far as this.
Then I criticized this.

47
00:07:28,609 --> 00:07:32,808
I criticized an experiment
which was supposed

48
00:07:34,008 --> 00:07:39,712
to be done by the biggest allergiologist
of the world. Benveniste.

49
00:07:43,012 --> 00:08:03,712
And he was in Bermuda and he said to 25
scientists of different types of professions,

50
00:08:04,062 --> 00:08:09,463
not only medical, and said I have
found something extraordinary.

51
00:08:12,463 --> 00:08:25,162
He said I found out that with the poison of
the bee there is degranulation of basophils.

52
00:08:27,863 --> 00:08:34,460
And I saw something which I have
to tell you that is beyond belief.

53
00:08:35,662 --> 00:08:47,960
That when I did not give the poison
itself but I gave a potency of 15CH,

54
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:12,262
that means much beyond the Avogadro
number and people were like this.

55
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:24,263
I said wait a moment. That is not possible
and he started a controversy after that.

56
00:09:26,361 --> 00:09:30,860
As a result it was proved
that he could not show

57
00:09:31,763 --> 00:09:40,759
that there is a degranulation
of basophils by 15CH.

58
00:09:41,663 --> 00:09:47,659
It was not possible because he
was saying that high potency

59
00:09:48,561 --> 00:10:01,462
could bring about a deep pathological
disturbance. It can destroy the cells.

60
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:10,762
If this was the case every wrong remedy
we'd give would destroy the organism.

61
00:10:13,161 --> 00:10:15,561
He was saying
something outrageous.

62
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:22,461
Yet people still believe today
that he may be correct.

63
00:10:23,662 --> 00:10:26,661
I don't understand how
they believe this.

64
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:34,761
You see the problem with Homeopathy
because it enters the area of energy,

65
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:41,961
a lot of craziness is injected
into the whole theory.

66
00:10:55,161 --> 00:11:03,862
Another question says whether the vaccination
increases the possibility of homosexuality.

67
00:11:05,361 --> 00:11:08,059
I do not know. I
cannot say that.

68
00:11:08,661 --> 00:11:15,261
All I can say is that homosexuality has
increased tremendously in our times

69
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:25,461
but I do not know whether it is because of
the vaccination or the pollution or culture

70
00:11:26,062 --> 00:11:36,263
or different other factors and people are
born with tendency to homosexuality.

71
00:11:36,859 --> 00:11:39,863
They cannot help it.

72
00:11:41,063 --> 00:11:44,063
If they are born
with that tendency,

73
00:11:44,363 --> 00:11:51,561
that means with that imbalance in their
hormonal profile, they have no chance.

74
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:56,362
They have to suppress themselves,
go to the monastery or whatever

75
00:11:57,261 --> 00:12:04,162
or they have to practice homosexuality
because they are attracting the same gender.

76
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:13,161
People I have spoken with,
a lot of times they said,

77
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:27,859
since childhood I could have
fantasies with the same sex.

78
00:12:29,663 --> 00:12:35,959
Does it change? That means there is
somewhere some problems we are causing

79
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:40,462
that disturb the
hormonal profile.

80
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:54,563
Because it is the hormonal
profile I suspect that the drugs

81
00:12:55,461 --> 00:13:13,461
which are used for cleaning the plants,
these substances which they spray,

82
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:26,361
contain hormones of the particular
insect which affects the fruit.

83
00:13:28,461 --> 00:13:37,161
Because the hormone attracts the male
and is caught and killed in the trap.

84
00:13:41,361 --> 00:13:56,359
I believe that the widely spread hormonal
substances for killing the insects of the trees

85
00:13:56,661 --> 00:14:01,759
and fruits have affected
people hormonally.

86
00:14:02,663 --> 00:14:08,659
This is an idea you
may take or leave.

87
00:14:09,264 --> 00:14:12,859
You may investigate it if you
are interested to find out

88
00:14:13,162 --> 00:14:17,961
which are the substances
exactly who have hormones.

89
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:24,861
But definitely there is a problem
and these people are suffering

90
00:14:25,461 --> 00:14:27,261
because of this condition.

91
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:37,762
Any other question?

92
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:07,459
All these paragraphs concern
instructions for provings

93
00:15:08,061 --> 00:15:17,659
and tell me after you have read
this paragraphs if there is anybody

94
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:23,959
who is supposed to do a proving
has taken not all these measures

95
00:15:24,863 --> 00:15:33,859
but half of them of what he says? And the
way he says the proving must be conducted.

96
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:41,063
There are provings... take a potency... take
a remedy and tell us what happened.

97
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:50,361
Is that possible? If the enemies
wanted to destroy Homeopathy

98
00:15:50,961 --> 00:15:57,861
that is the way they would do it.
Inject nonsense to the system.

99
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:03,562
Once you do that people will be confused
and the system will be finished

100
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:19,463
unless we stay pure of what is the correct
thing forget Homeopathy in 20 years.

101
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,863
Homeopathy will be diluted
with a lot of nonsense.

102
00:16:26,663 --> 00:16:40,363
125."During all the time the experiment
lasts the diet must be strictly regulated..."

103
00:16:41,261 --> 00:16:47,560
Who, is of these people who are
doing proving, regulating the diet?

104
00:16:51,459 --> 00:16:56,861
"...it should be as much as
possible destitute of spices,

105
00:16:58,362 --> 00:17:10,962
of a purely nutritious and simple
character, green vegetables...

106
00:17:28,961 --> 00:17:37,761
Young green peas, green French
beans ('boiled potatoes')

107
00:17:38,362 --> 00:17:45,860
and in all cases carrots are allowable,
as the least medicinal vegetables."

108
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:52,163
So precise information.

109
00:17:56,062 --> 00:18:06,561
If you eat spice or food that excites the
organism it will interfere with the experiment.

110
00:18:19,162 --> 00:18:23,961
And he mentions some food
that existed by that time.

111
00:18:33,564 --> 00:18:40,660
"...drinks are to be those usually partaken
of, as little stimulating as possible".

112
00:18:49,061 --> 00:19:16,660
Coca cola, not allowed. Retsina, not allowed.
Brandy, you know all these spiritual things.

113
00:19:28,362 --> 00:19:37,063
In the note he says "The subject of
experiment must either be not in the habit

114
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:42,162
of taking pure wine,
brandy, coffee or tea,

115
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:50,261
or he must have totally abstained
for a considerable time previously

116
00:19:50,864 --> 00:19:53,412
from the use of these injurious beverages, some
of which are stimulating, others medicinal."

117
00:19:54,014 --> 00:20:01,210
Either you declare that I don't
drink coffee, tea, beer etc.

118
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:05,958
or you abstain for one month before
you can enter the experiment.

119
00:20:08,656 --> 00:20:14,960
You see how serious
this science is.

120
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:27,856
That is exactly what should be followed if we
want to claim that we are applying a science.

121
00:20:28,456 --> 00:20:32,057
Otherwise we apply hocus pocus.

122
00:20:38,956 --> 00:20:45,560
I like to do this, I like to put
the water over the scriptures

123
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:50,960
and say you take now
the New Testament...

124
00:21:05,659 --> 00:21:12,256
126."The person who is proving the medicine
must during the whole time of the experiment

125
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:29,356
avoid all over-exertion of mind and body, all
sorts of dissipation and disturbing passions;

126
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:44,060
he should have no urgent business
to distract his attention;

127
00:21:45,857 --> 00:21:55,758
he must devote himself to careful self-observation
and not be disturbed while so engaged..."

128
00:21:59,357 --> 00:22:05,956
If you read these instructions you
will understand that the people

129
00:22:07,156 --> 00:22:16,756
who did the original provings were
entirely devoted to this task.

130
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:33,256
They had a vision, an enthusiasm, an
initiative inside them to discover.

131
00:22:34,459 --> 00:22:44,956
By the time of Hahnemann they were discovering
the best possible tool for curing people.

132
00:22:46,161 --> 00:22:51,256
They had the feeling I am
doing such a serious task.

133
00:22:52,159 --> 00:23:02,056
All their mind, attention, everything
was devoted to this task to discover

134
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:08,958
and to unfold the medicinal
powers of the drugs.

135
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:15,857
Otherwise can anybody tell
me that you can apply this?

136
00:23:17,056 --> 00:23:25,156
Find me a group of people to
apply all these instructions.

137
00:23:26,357 --> 00:23:41,358
Only those who really believe that by
proving a remedy they will be discovering

138
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:48,857
one more possibility for
certain sick people.

139
00:23:49,757 --> 00:23:56,356
That with this remedy it might be that
some people are going to be cured.

140
00:23:56,959 --> 00:24:02,059
So we are going to give to the world a
new possibility for few more people

141
00:24:02,957 --> 00:24:11,056
but it really is a possibility.
Not a fantasy.

142
00:24:12,859 --> 00:24:20,958
It came slowly to believe that all
this is nonsense, Hahnemann is older,

143
00:24:21,557 --> 00:24:27,558
forget him and now we have
the modern fantasy provings.

144
00:24:31,156 --> 00:24:36,860
We reached the point where some homeopath
who followed my teaching for 10 years,

145
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:43,757
finally said you don't
need to prove a remedy.

146
00:24:44,058 --> 00:24:51,259
You have to imagine what it can do
and this was accepted by people

147
00:24:53,356 --> 00:24:57,259
which is pathetic for me.

148
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:07,159
My training is such, you know
I don't accept nonsense.

149
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:10,456
Because if you are 10 years
old and you have to survive,

150
00:25:11,358 --> 00:25:16,760
you know what is right and what is wrong.
And you have to do what you have to do.

151
00:25:17,658 --> 00:25:19,158
Not playing nonsense.

152
00:25:22,156 --> 00:25:28,559
I was in that position, my parents left me
so you are alone, so you have to survive.

153
00:25:29,757 --> 00:25:31,861
The same way I feel
with Homeopathy.

154
00:25:32,461 --> 00:25:37,858
When I came to Homeopathy and saw the nonsense
that was going on I said you are alone,

155
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:43,311
Homeopathy must survive.

156
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:56,212
Then of course I started the fight
and the pharmaceutical industry

157
00:25:56,814 --> 00:26:01,614
was the first one to
attack, we must kill you.

158
00:26:06,709 --> 00:26:12,413
It's a big pharmaceutical company and they
come and say who needs George? Kill him.

159
00:26:13,909 --> 00:26:18,110
I was going to meet the manager of a big
homeopathic pharmaceutical company,

160
00:26:18,712 --> 00:26:22,909
and the other from the other pharmaceutical
company said I am going to meet George

161
00:26:23,511 --> 00:26:30,709
and said just kill him! He told me.
Not directly.

162
00:26:31,311 --> 00:26:34,910
He said to one of my students
and my student told me.

163
00:26:56,693 --> 00:26:59,093
I'm testing my voice!

164
00:27:10,493 --> 00:27:17,998
I had to fight against first
the pharmaceutical industry

165
00:27:18,893 --> 00:27:23,693
and I said to them
what you do is wrong.

166
00:27:26,095 --> 00:27:38,997
I also know that you cannot survive
if everybody takes only one dose,

167
00:27:39,597 --> 00:27:42,895
one remedy or a few doses.
You cannot survive.

168
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:56,993
But what I do gives you prestige
to the world so you can survive

169
00:27:57,896 --> 00:28:01,194
because people will still
believe in Homeopathy.

170
00:28:01,795 --> 00:28:11,095
If you continue only with your system
Homeopathy will totally disappear.

171
00:28:11,993 --> 00:28:26,695
In 1960 when I came into Homeopathy it was practiced
by very few people only with specialties.

172
00:28:28,497 --> 00:28:36,596
It has already been out of the picture
as a medical therapeutic modality.

173
00:28:44,096 --> 00:28:48,295
In few years it would finish,
nobody would know about Homeopathy.

174
00:28:53,397 --> 00:29:05,095
One owner of a big company came to
meet me and said you must respect us.

175
00:29:06,825 --> 00:29:11,623
We respect you and you
have to respect us.

176
00:29:13,426 --> 00:29:19,426
I said to him respect is earned, if you
earn my respect I will give it to you

177
00:29:20,324 --> 00:29:26,623
but don't ask my respect. I cannot give it.
I know you are doing wrong.

178
00:29:28,123 --> 00:29:33,223
You are making specialties and you
say these will cure this and that

179
00:29:33,525 --> 00:29:35,624
which is not true
and you know it.

180
00:29:39,828 --> 00:29:48,224
He came to the meeting and told to my
secretary that George gave me a cold shower.

181
00:29:50,324 --> 00:30:10,424
Of course! Later they said we must kill
you... This is the big argument that,

182
00:30:11,323 --> 00:30:19,327
because of the miraculous cures
classical homeopaths are able to do,

183
00:30:19,926 --> 00:30:27,423
the prestige of Homeopathy has
raised and these people can claim

184
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:33,125
we are producing homeopathic remedies.
Otherwise they would close down.

185
00:30:34,024 --> 00:30:35,527
It's because of us.

186
00:30:43,626 --> 00:30:51,427
"...he must devote himself to careful
self-observation and not be disturbed

187
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:59,826
while so engaged; his body must be in
what is for him a good state of health,

188
00:31:00,723 --> 00:31:10,623
and he must possess a sufficient amount
of intelligence to be able to express

189
00:31:11,072 --> 00:31:16,169
and describe his sensations
in accurate terms."

190
00:31:30,571 --> 00:31:37,472
At least you have enough intelligence,
don't tell nonsense please!

191
00:31:56,373 --> 00:32:08,372
I have bought it 15 years ago from an
airport, 10 euros and it's 1 degree.

192
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:19,770
Now I need the next generation!
Still it works but not very well.

193
00:32:32,371 --> 00:32:35,373
This German makes good remarks.

194
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:38,973
I pay special attention
to her.<br/>- Thank you.

195
00:32:39,573 --> 00:32:41,973
It's more a remark
than a question.

196
00:32:42,272 --> 00:32:44,672
I've been to the center council
of homeopathic research

197
00:32:45,271 --> 00:32:55,469
and they are doing a lot of drug provings
and they try to get the healthiest provers.

198
00:32:57,573 --> 00:33:00,571
I have one remark.

199
00:33:01,471 --> 00:33:05,973
They have different scales
for choosing the sensibility

200
00:33:06,871 --> 00:33:12,573
which might not be good enough but
maybe you could get in touch with them

201
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:22,769
and tell them about the idea of not
giving high potencies to all of them

202
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:26,072
because I was sitting with
them and telling them...

203
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,972
- Where is this group?
<br/>- In Delhi.

204
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:36,269
But every homeopathic college
now has to do drug provings

205
00:33:36,572 --> 00:33:59,070
and they have a format, guidelines to
follow... I saw how they perform it.

206
00:33:59,373 --> 00:34:03,793
They do exactly that.
 They have only students...

207
00:34:08,508 --> 00:34:11,206
- With whom did you speak to
know that they are doing it?

208
00:34:11,509 --> 00:34:13,907
- They head of the council
of homeopathic research.

209
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:23,807
And I attained the session of the drug proving
committee from all the place over India.

210
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:41,509
Not all of them but... Those who are
performing the drug proving in the colleges.

211
00:34:43,307 --> 00:34:44,809
And I saw the format.

212
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:49,006
-What would be important is
to speak with the provers.

213
00:34:49,608 --> 00:34:53,207
Because there is
the final truth.

214
00:34:56,806 --> 00:35:02,206
When I went and spoke with a prover
I found out what was going on.

215
00:35:02,506 --> 00:35:11,210
People were speaking to each other,
wake up and relate their experiences,

216
00:35:12,407 --> 00:35:18,409
what dream did you see etc.

217
00:35:19,311 --> 00:35:27,707
There was a report of a thing
like that with a control.

218
00:35:30,408 --> 00:35:37,010
Half were the control and half were taking.
And they had seen dreams.

219
00:35:37,606 --> 00:35:44,508
They take the dreams of the control
and the dreams of the provers.

220
00:35:46,608 --> 00:35:51,409
They said we found out that
their dreams are similar.

221
00:35:55,010 --> 00:36:10,306
How do you explain this? The drug
was influencing the placebo group

222
00:36:11,509 --> 00:36:21,407
through electromagnetic fields,
so they got similar dreams.

223
00:36:22,309 --> 00:36:26,807
Is this an explanation? I said I
will give another explanation.

224
00:36:28,609 --> 00:36:33,406
The provers and also the
placebo felt nothing.

225
00:36:33,711 --> 00:36:38,806
They had similar things because
none of them made a difference.

226
00:36:40,607 --> 00:36:42,109
That's the explanation.

227
00:36:44,208 --> 00:36:46,010
- They don't have
enough symptoms.

228
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:55,310
But are proving 12CH, 30CH and
200CH with a placebo line as well.

229
00:36:56,807 --> 00:37:00,706
So it might interesting
to speak to them...

230
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:04,007
- They will not listen to me.

231
00:37:04,306 --> 00:37:09,406
Just write them a letter and say why
don't you come in contact with me

232
00:37:10,006 --> 00:37:14,210
and I will tell them my
opinion, what they should do.

233
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:37,911
- When I was doing my post-graduation this
law was implemented into the colleges

234
00:37:38,811 --> 00:37:44,806
and I have seen one proving
being done in my college

235
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:50,811
where I was doing my post-graduation
and it was really the worst.

236
00:37:55,011 --> 00:38:04,310
It has absolutely nothing to do what they do
in the colleges with what the council says.

237
00:38:05,208 --> 00:38:09,707
Because the central council of Homeopathy
and the council of research in Homeopathy

238
00:38:10,606 --> 00:38:16,606
are doing good work but the grass root level
the reality is something totally different.

239
00:38:20,807 --> 00:38:31,307
9 out of 10 provings are done
either by juniors or seniors.

240
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:43,007
I saw all of them very closely and for a period
of 3 months it was absolutely non existing!

241
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:58,608
There was no day book, they used to smoke...
Only 10% was done according the guidelines.

242
00:39:01,306 --> 00:39:07,009
- I feel the only way that a proving can
be done is only by idealistic people

243
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:16,310
who are devoted to this idea and can
really devote themselves to this task.

244
00:39:17,207 --> 00:39:23,206
Unless this inner urge to do
this comes from the inside

245
00:39:24,707 --> 00:39:30,706
to impose a proving to a
class like that, forget it.

246
00:39:34,909 --> 00:39:41,208
That is why I am so furious when
I see every day a new proving.

247
00:39:47,506 --> 00:39:50,209
Is it easy to make a proving...?

248
00:40:04,908 --> 00:40:13,308
127."The medicines must be tested
on both males and females,

249
00:40:13,906 --> 00:40:22,007
in order also to reveal the alterations of the
health they produce in the sexual sphere."

250
00:40:26,809 --> 00:40:37,906
128."The most recent observations
have shown that medicinal substances,

251
00:40:38,206 --> 00:40:43,007
when taken in their crude
state by the experimenter

252
00:40:44,209 --> 00:40:47,210
for the purpose of testing
their peculiar effects,

253
00:40:47,808 --> 00:40:55,007
do not exhibit nearly the full amount
of the powers that lie hidden in them

254
00:40:55,910 --> 00:41:03,106
which they do when they are taken for the
same object in high dilutions potentized

255
00:41:03,706 --> 00:41:13,311
by proper trituration and succussion,
by which simple operations the powers

256
00:41:13,607 --> 00:41:19,607
which in their crude state lay
hidden, and, as it were, dormant,

257
00:41:21,108 --> 00:41:27,107
are developed and roused into
activity to an incredible extent.

258
00:41:34,306 --> 00:41:40,607
In this manner we now find it best
to investigate the medicinal powers

259
00:41:40,907 --> 00:41:50,207
even of such substances as are deemed weak, and
the plan we adopt is to give to the experimenter,

260
00:41:51,107 --> 00:41:56,807
on an empty stomach, daily from
four to six very small globules

261
00:41:57,407 --> 00:42:09,106
of the thirtieth potentized dilution of such
a substance, moistened with a little water,

262
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:20,810
and let him continue this for several
days" What he says is very simple.

263
00:42:21,406 --> 00:42:28,007
He says that if you take only the
crude form you will have symptoms

264
00:42:28,307 --> 00:42:35,506
but not the full extent of the possibility
of that drug to produce symptoms.

265
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:54,408
The last years we have come to the habit
of proving a high potency up to the 30th

266
00:43:00,406 --> 00:43:08,210
in order to get the more
subtle aspects of the drug.

267
00:43:12,107 --> 00:43:22,308
129."If the effects that result
from such a dose are but slight,

268
00:43:25,606 --> 00:43:33,706
a few more globules may be taken daily, until
they become more distinct and stronger

269
00:43:34,607 --> 00:43:38,510
and the alterations of the
health more conspicuous;

270
00:43:39,107 --> 00:43:45,407
for all persons are not effected by a
medicine in an equally great degree;

271
00:43:46,006 --> 00:43:50,510
on the contrary, there is a
vast variety in this respect,

272
00:43:51,408 --> 00:43:58,308
so that sometimes an apparently weak
individual may by scarcely at all

273
00:43:58,607 --> 00:44:04,306
affected by moderate doses of a medicine
known to be of a powerful character,

274
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:14,807
while he is strongly enough acted
on by others of a much weaker kind."

275
00:44:16,608 --> 00:44:22,806
 There is here again a
misconception of Hahnemann.

276
00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:40,807
He says if the dose that you take, one
dose of 30th potency, is not enough,

277
00:44:41,708 --> 00:44:48,709
does not show enough, give a
little bit more globules.

278
00:44:53,509 --> 00:45:00,110
Giving more globules is not giving
more remedy in the 30th potency.

279
00:45:00,706 --> 00:45:06,109
For 30th potency you drink
globules of one cup

280
00:45:06,709 --> 00:45:10,606
or you take 3 globules it
is the same, one dose.

281
00:45:12,407 --> 00:45:18,711
In reality either you take
a whole bottle of 30th,

282
00:45:19,308 --> 00:45:27,711
you have not taken a large dose, you have
taken just one dose of 30th potency.

283
00:45:28,908 --> 00:45:36,710
Because there are no molecules
left in these dilutions.

284
00:45:37,607 --> 00:45:45,408
Whether you take a few globules or
1000 globules it's the same, one dose.

285
00:45:50,506 --> 00:46:00,710
Hahnemann still has this
material idea of remedies.

286
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:08,606
"If the effects that result from
such a dose are but slight,

287
00:46:08,907 --> 00:46:12,810
a few more globules
may be taken daily".

288
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:24,510
And he says something
which is also true.

289
00:46:26,008 --> 00:46:35,606
It's strange how he has noticed
that one dose of a weak remedy,

290
00:46:35,909 --> 00:46:41,009
a weak remedy means that the
remedy comes from a substance

291
00:46:42,206 --> 00:46:52,406
that does not affect the human organism, a
plant, that is considered a weak substance,

292
00:46:53,307 --> 00:46:59,310
such a weak substance he says you
give a dose to a weak organism

293
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:07,706
and has no effect and you give it to a
strong organism and you may have an effect.

294
00:47:08,907 --> 00:47:19,608
Which is true. But he confuses here the
action of the remedy with quantity...

295
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:24,408
It's not quantity, it's
quality of the drugs.

296
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:34,007
When you potentize beyond a
certain potency 12X I think,

297
00:47:36,411 --> 00:47:43,307
chemistry know there is not
one molecule in the solvent.

298
00:47:45,107 --> 00:47:53,510
Therefore what you are giving
after the 12X is pure energy.

299
00:47:55,907 --> 00:48:00,706
The particular energy
structure of the drug.

300
00:48:01,609 --> 00:48:04,910
You don't give
quantity but quality.

301
00:48:10,006 --> 00:48:11,806
- I do not really get this.

302
00:48:13,309 --> 00:48:19,307
If the remedy is an energy, there
is such a thing as too much energy

303
00:48:20,208 --> 00:48:25,006
and little energy, so you speak of
quantity also in terms of energy.

304
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:45,710
- You see energy is supposed to be in
different types, we have electric etc.

305
00:48:49,306 --> 00:48:55,008
Here we are talking about a new type
of energy, we don't know the energy

306
00:48:55,311 --> 00:48:57,111
that comes from the plant.

307
00:48:59,207 --> 00:49:03,406
Also we do not know exactly
the energy of the body.

308
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:13,006
So what we are dealing with here,
is an energy of substances

309
00:49:13,606 --> 00:49:23,206
which have been processed and have arrived
at a state of becoming open energy

310
00:49:23,810 --> 00:49:31,307
with certain qualities which is
going to affect another energy,

311
00:49:32,506 --> 00:49:36,110
the nature which is
also not investigated.

312
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:49,007
I do not know if you confused the electric
energy for instance with that energy

313
00:49:50,206 --> 00:49:58,610
or electromagnetic produced by a machine
where you can the amount of energy,

314
00:50:03,411 --> 00:50:12,108
with these kinds of energies where
machines are producing electric energy,

315
00:50:12,709 --> 00:50:14,507
electromagnetic fields etc.

316
00:50:15,107 --> 00:50:19,008
out of machines can be
speaking about increasing

317
00:50:19,308 --> 00:50:27,706
or decreasing the quantity of the
energy in a way. Not with this.

318
00:50:29,206 --> 00:50:39,106
We do not have the possibility to
increase the energy with the meaning

319
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:43,907
we know we can do with
other types of energy.

320
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:52,007
What is really happening? We have to
investigate. It is a big subject.

321
00:50:55,306 --> 00:51:08,210
What we are doing? We are matching an
energy of a body with the energy of a drug.

322
00:51:11,809 --> 00:51:19,309
Here the opposite happens of what
usually happens in quantity.

323
00:51:23,808 --> 00:51:39,410
We know that as we reduce the amount of
material substance the more we reduce it

324
00:51:40,609 --> 00:51:45,409
the more active the
remedy becomes.

325
00:51:46,309 --> 00:51:53,509
So a 10M potency is more
powerful than a 30CH.

326
00:51:54,411 --> 00:52:03,406
But this 10M has been reduced more and
more as far as quantity is concerned.

327
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:14,509
That means the original material substance.
With this idea we enter another concept.

328
00:52:16,609 --> 00:52:22,311
We have now to deal
with levels of energy.

329
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:32,732
Levels of subtle energy
and more and more subtle.

330
00:52:33,336 --> 00:52:36,634
This is the idea here
with Homeopathy.

331
00:52:42,032 --> 00:52:55,835
Ideally each one of us is performing
in a level of subtle energy .

332
00:52:57,033 --> 00:53:08,736
The level my organism is functioning is on an
energy scale that we measure with potencies.

333
00:53:10,837 --> 00:53:19,235
It is performing in 777 potency.

334
00:53:20,732 --> 00:53:36,937
My performance, disturbance,
is functioning on 925 potency.

335
00:53:38,435 --> 00:53:45,336
So when I get a 200 is too low, it is
going to last for a short period of time.

336
00:53:46,234 --> 00:53:52,535
Then I go to 1M which is over
the 925 that I am functioning

337
00:53:53,133 --> 00:53:56,433
and then I remain for a
longer period of time.

338
00:54:00,033 --> 00:54:06,632
When I go to 1M still there is relapse.
I have to go higher.

339
00:54:07,532 --> 00:54:13,832
Then 50000 or CM and
then you get a picture.

340
00:54:16,536 --> 00:54:24,933
There is a level of energy on which
each one of us is functioning

341
00:54:26,436 --> 00:54:28,535
and needs a particular potency.

342
00:54:29,732 --> 00:54:33,333
Nobody ever can find the
exact potency that we need.

343
00:54:35,734 --> 00:54:43,232
More or less we assume.

344
00:54:45,335 --> 00:54:51,632
When we say 200CH will not
give big aggravation,

345
00:54:52,533 --> 00:55:04,533
we mean if he is functioning
on 250CH and I give 200CH

346
00:55:05,132 --> 00:55:11,736
is going to have an effect
but not entirely, not cured.

347
00:55:12,337 --> 00:55:19,532
If I give a 50M it may be
too far with no effect.

348
00:55:21,032 --> 00:55:29,435
If I give 10M still may
create a big aggravation.

349
00:55:30,936 --> 00:55:39,035
That is why we avoid the big
aggravations in pathology stage.

350
00:55:40,835 --> 00:55:47,432
We say go first to 200CH, 30CH
to find if the pathology is deep

351
00:55:48,332 --> 00:55:53,133
and then proceed further
with a higher potency.

352
00:55:54,036 --> 00:56:01,837
Sometimes I experiment with potencies
like 30CH, 34CH, 35CH sometimes

353
00:56:02,732 --> 00:56:04,834
I see there is a relapse...

354
00:56:08,135 --> 00:56:17,942
jump to 200CH, 250CH there
is still a relapse, 1M ok

355
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:25,443
there is a time when the person remains
steady and is supposed to be cured.

356
00:56:32,042 --> 00:56:36,243
Is this clear or you still
have some questions?

357
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:42,544
- It seems to me that we
are speaking of something

358
00:56:42,843 --> 00:56:51,540
that is very close to the border
between energy and information

359
00:56:55,740 --> 00:57:01,442
and it is like a switch
on and off mechanism.

360
00:57:02,344 --> 00:57:07,144
Once I reach the switching
on it's working,

361
00:57:07,739 --> 00:57:12,843
if I don't reach the resonance
of switching is not working.

362
00:57:14,342 --> 00:57:21,241
- But strangely enough there
is a limit that means

363
00:57:21,541 --> 00:57:31,741
in a case this limit of
reacting is from 12 to 1000,

364
00:57:32,341 --> 00:57:41,940
within this limit whatever you give is
going to react. But the best would be 1M.

365
00:57:43,443 --> 00:57:47,643
In another person the limit
is between 30CH and 50M.

366
00:57:48,241 --> 00:57:51,841
Whatever potency you give
between these is going to act

367
00:57:53,641 --> 00:58:03,243
but again it will need a repetition
until you strike a potency

368
00:58:03,539 --> 00:58:11,640
which is beyond the one which is
functioning. This is experience.

369
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:26,641
- In 128 the dilution of 3 or 4 globuli
maybe the quality of perception

370
00:58:27,242 --> 00:58:31,739
is different when you get it in
water because the amount of nerves

371
00:58:32,341 --> 00:58:35,641
that come in contact with
the information is bigger

372
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:40,140
or why does he mention
that water thing?

373
00:59:03,841 --> 00:59:09,541
- "The most recent observations"
you see here what he says,

374
00:59:12,242 --> 00:59:17,639
we have been doing experiments
with material doses.

375
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:32,341
Most of the information in Hahnemann's M.M.
come from provings from small material doses.

376
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:45,839
In the 6th edition he says "The
most recent observations have shown

377
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:54,541
that medicinal substances, when taken in
their crude state by the experimenter"

378
00:59:56,041 --> 01:00:04,141
do not show all their
possibilities so we found out

379
01:00:05,044 --> 01:00:12,541
that we can have some more
information about these drugs

380
01:00:13,744 --> 01:00:26,641
by proving them in higher potency up to
the 30th. Your question is about water.

381
01:00:28,142 --> 01:00:32,343
- It's about the end. Where
the 4 to 6 globuli appear.

382
01:00:32,943 --> 01:00:44,643
He also continues that...<br/>- He gives
importance to the globuli.

383
01:00:45,239 --> 01:00:47,041
- And to the water I think.

384
01:00:47,341 --> 01:00:52,739
Make wet with water first, then it's
diluted with water, and drink it.

385
01:00:53,939 --> 01:00:59,339
- What I wanted to point out
in your attention is the fact

386
01:00:59,942 --> 01:01:09,243
that in spite the fact that Hahnemann
is talking about high potency provings

387
01:01:09,841 --> 01:01:19,741
still he gives importance to the
quantity which does not exist.

388
01:01:20,642 --> 01:01:34,141
The quantity does not exist when
you pass the 12X or 18X or 12CH.

389
01:01:34,442 --> 01:01:39,841
once you pass this number quantity
is not of importance anymore.

390
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:45,539
But Hahnemann still having
proven all the time the remedies

391
01:01:47,044 --> 01:01:52,440
with material doses he still believes
that if you give more globuli

392
01:01:53,639 --> 01:01:55,742
even in higher potency
will have a better effect.

393
01:01:56,342 --> 01:02:04,141
That means if I take a
whole bottle of globuli

394
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:10,442
it will have a more powerful effect than
if I take a few globuli. This is not true.

395
01:02:11,939 --> 01:02:15,542
- I do understand that exactly but
he continues after these globuli

396
01:02:18,241 --> 01:02:22,442
saying that he puts them
in water and I wonder...

397
01:02:23,044 --> 01:02:28,442
- This is his experience,
the diluting in water.

398
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:37,439
My experience is when I take a few globuli
and you have the water up to here

399
01:02:39,542 --> 01:02:46,142
and stir up these few globulis inside this
water and you take a sip of this water

400
01:02:46,739 --> 01:02:58,442
it seems that all the molecules of the water
have absorbed the energy of the drug.

401
01:02:59,339 --> 01:03:07,740
So it is a matter of an energy, a subtle
energy of an unknown type for us,

402
01:03:08,642 --> 01:03:16,743
still nobody can know, but still
when a few globuli are diluted

403
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:23,041
and all the molecules of the water
become potent and you take one sip,

404
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:29,040
you have taken one dose. If drink the
whole water you have taken one dose.

405
01:03:29,641 --> 01:03:35,044
If you sip the water
constantly you take one dose.

406
01:03:38,642 --> 01:03:42,843
- I wonder if the perception
is different if you drink it

407
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:46,444
or if you take as a globuli.

408
01:03:47,341 --> 01:03:50,640
I mean if you drink something
it gets everywhere in the mouth

409
01:03:54,542 --> 01:03:57,539
and maybe there is a quality
difference in perception

410
01:03:58,141 --> 01:03:59,644
of the information
of the remedy.

411
01:04:00,842 --> 01:04:14,341
The perception, how you get it into you.
How you get the information.

412
01:04:17,643 --> 01:04:29,341
- If somebody is in a coma state and as I
was saying the other day with the woman

413
01:04:29,644 --> 01:04:36,844
who was lying in a coma and I said
take this water and put it over,

414
01:04:37,439 --> 01:04:46,641
the moment the water comes in contact with
the mucus membrane then it has acted.

415
01:04:47,543 --> 01:05:01,041
It needs some sensitive parts
of the body with nerve endings

416
01:05:01,941 --> 01:05:07,641
because I believe the nervous system
is of great importance

417
01:05:08,843 --> 01:05:21,844
because if you give it to the skin,
the skin protects, it will not act

418
01:05:23,041 --> 01:05:26,642
but if you go to the skin
which is in the armpits

419
01:05:27,541 --> 01:05:37,142
where the skin is quite sensitive and
between mucus membranes it may still act.

420
01:05:40,743 --> 01:05:50,041
The interesting thing is somewhere
he says that you can smell a remedy

421
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:54,841
and still have an effect.

422
01:05:56,041 --> 01:06:00,241
The remedy has to be in alcohol

423
01:06:01,742 --> 01:06:16,444
and with the evaporation of
molecules from the alcohol

424
01:06:18,242 --> 01:06:29,641
and smell it, then there is
the energy of the remedy.

425
01:06:30,541 --> 01:06:38,340
So if you found a very close remedy or the
exact remedy you may smell the potency

426
01:06:39,541 --> 01:06:42,842
and have quite a
strong reaction.

427
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,843
Aphorism 24. Read

428
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:07,141
- "Besides the tongue,
mouth and stomach,

429
01:07:07,739 --> 01:07:11,343
which are most commonly affected
by the administration of medicine,

430
01:07:12,842 --> 01:07:20,941
the nose and respiratory organs are receptive
of the action of medicines in fluid form

431
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:26,042
by means of olfaction and
inhalation through the mouth."

432
01:07:32,041 --> 01:07:44,640
- You said that if we take many sips
from the cup it is still one dose.

433
01:07:45,841 --> 01:07:51,241
- Every sip is one dose.

434
01:07:55,440 --> 01:08:00,842
- So if I take 20 sips...
-You take 20 doses.

435
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:12,942
So in this case when you have
for instance an acute condition

436
01:08:13,241 --> 01:08:18,341
where you have to repeat frequently
you ask the people to do that.

437
01:08:18,940 --> 01:08:24,623
The problem is that if they are not
careful, if they don't do it properly,

438
01:08:25,222 --> 01:08:32,425
if sometimes you have to hit quite
strongly in order to dissolve this pills.

439
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:34,522
It's not so easy.

440
01:08:36,322 --> 01:08:40,820
But if you do it properly, each time
you take a sip you take a dose.

441
01:08:42,323 --> 01:08:45,021
If you take 20 sips
it's 20 doses.

442
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:50,720
- At once?<br/>- Not at once.

443
01:08:51,924 --> 01:08:55,523
I take one sip now. In the
afternoon I take another sip.

444
01:08:57,921 --> 01:09:03,023
- How much have these
sips to be separated?

445
01:09:06,923 --> 01:09:10,521
- It depends on the intensity
of the acute condition.

446
01:09:11,421 --> 01:09:21,538
If you have very high fever
with spasm, fever convulsions

447
01:09:22,521 --> 01:09:25,735
then every 5 or 10 minutes
you have to take it.

448
01:09:27,836 --> 01:09:32,039
Wait 5 minutes and then take it, wait
another 5 minutes then take on more dose...

449
01:09:34,436 --> 01:09:43,739
In dengue fever in India I
had to give it every 3 hours

450
01:09:45,536 --> 01:09:50,336
because I could see if they
waited longer than 3 hours

451
01:09:50,939 --> 01:09:58,740
then there was a relapse of the fever.
I told them to drink it every 3 hours.

452
01:09:59,339 --> 01:10:03,836
Sometimes you have to repeat every
2 hours in order to control.

453
01:10:06,238 --> 01:10:14,036
- I am treating many dengue fevers and
I was asking myself if I am wrong

454
01:10:14,638 --> 01:10:17,935
with this but I never treated
so often like 3 hours.

455
01:10:19,438 --> 01:10:22,438
- You are a little bit
shy and you speak.

456
01:10:23,337 --> 01:10:40,137
- I said I see many dengue, chikungunya,
tropical fevers. In Thailand.

457
01:10:46,439 --> 01:10:50,035
- In chikungunya you have
to give every 2 hours.

458
01:10:50,935 --> 01:10:53,936
- I didn't know, thank you.

459
01:10:57,537 --> 01:11:03,237
- Another question? Canada!

460
01:11:12,405 --> 01:11:15,538
- You said that after
12X...<br/>- No 12X, 12CH.

461
01:11:20,335 --> 01:11:25,435
I said 12X and then I
corrected it 12CH.

462
01:11:27,238 --> 01:11:32,935
After 12CH it is going
beyond Avogadro number.

463
01:11:36,538 --> 01:11:41,640
You see everyone is trying
to catch me in something...

464
01:11:43,438 --> 01:11:46,738
- No George I was
trying to make sure.

465
01:11:52,736 --> 01:11:54,835
- I am open to admit.

466
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:58,977
If I made mistake I am going to
say I made a mistake. No problem.

467
01:11:59,573 --> 01:12:04,558
That's why I am not offended if
somebody tell me you are wrong.

468
01:12:09,961 --> 01:12:16,563
We were discussing with another
doctor on the word of accouchement.

469
01:12:20,758 --> 01:12:30,062
In my book there was not coma
so I read sexual accouchement.

470
01:12:31,563 --> 01:12:43,860
Since Hahnemann was talking about
situations you have to be aware of

471
01:12:44,462 --> 01:12:49,559
and if that is a situation it may
be natural to have a symptom,

472
01:12:51,658 --> 01:12:58,261
a situation when somebody
is during menses etc.

473
01:13:01,261 --> 01:13:10,858
I thought accouchement means
most probably indulgence in sex.

474
01:13:12,016 --> 01:13:20,761
Indulgence in sex could give a
symptomatology that if you stop,

475
01:13:21,661 --> 01:13:25,859
simply, symptoms go away. You
don't need to give a remedy.

476
01:13:26,162 --> 01:13:28,561
This is what he says.

477
01:13:29,162 --> 01:13:34,261
In some situations, wait, the
situation will pass or advise

478
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:38,162
and you don't need
to give a remedy.

479
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:51,959
I have explained this wrongly
as sexual indulgence.

480
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:57,360
I know none of you is doing
this, so there's no problem.

481
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:08,460
- You said before that for
example there can be a case

482
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:14,461
where any potency between 6C
and 10M will have an effect.

483
01:14:16,859 --> 01:14:19,263
But the optimum will be 1M.

484
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:29,158
That means the beyond 10M there
will be no effect at all

485
01:14:29,758 --> 01:14:35,460
or that any potency beyond
10M could be dangerous?

486
01:14:36,058 --> 01:14:40,261
In old books like Kent says that
in certain cases it's dangerous

487
01:14:41,459 --> 01:14:48,960
to start with high potencies.
That's my question.

488
01:14:50,161 --> 01:14:56,759
- Experience has shown that sometimes
when you give a very high potency

489
01:14:57,061 --> 01:15:00,662
there is no effect. You give
200CH and there is effect.

490
01:15:01,259 --> 01:15:02,458
This is one experience.

491
01:15:02,761 --> 01:15:08,758
Another experience has shown
that you give in a case 10M

492
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:12,362
and there is a big reaction,
perhaps unnecessary.

493
01:15:12,961 --> 01:15:20,158
If you had given a lower potency the
reaction might have been better.

494
01:15:21,663 --> 01:15:30,063
Therefore since we do not know
beforehand what is the optimum potency

495
01:15:31,862 --> 01:15:37,861
we go carefully investigating
the organism. Take 1M.

496
01:15:39,059 --> 01:15:44,161
Good reaction, I remain well
for 5 years, that was good.

497
01:15:45,661 --> 01:15:51,062
But good reaction and after 2
months I am back. Ok go 10M.

498
01:15:53,461 --> 01:16:03,958
So also the 200CH, 1M, 10M etc are
steps arbitrarily set by Kent.

499
01:16:05,158 --> 01:16:11,161
Kent was the one who said
most probably after 1M

500
01:16:11,761 --> 01:16:19,259
you need quite a higher potency
in order to have an effect.

501
01:16:19,861 --> 01:16:27,960
So he said it but at the same time
the potencies during that time

502
01:16:29,759 --> 01:16:36,360
were done not in a
very proper manner.

503
01:16:36,963 --> 01:16:39,660
Because Hahnemann never
thought of such potencies.

504
01:16:42,962 --> 01:16:48,362
It was impossible to think. He was
thinking of 30CH and that was the end.

505
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:53,762
I think maybe he tried one
or two time with 60CH.

506
01:16:54,958 --> 01:17:02,162
But it was beyond any limit. Kent
experimented with much higher potencies.

507
01:17:04,261 --> 01:17:07,261
The Fincke potencies
as he calls.

508
01:17:15,961 --> 01:17:27,060
They were made by jets, by having
the substance potentized up to 30CH

509
01:17:28,861 --> 01:17:40,862
and after that the tube with the
liquid goes in front of a machine

510
01:17:42,061 --> 01:17:54,961
which injects with great force
an equal amount of water

511
01:17:55,563 --> 01:18:11,158
that is already in the bottle. The water
will jump out new water is inside.

512
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:23,162
So even doing so there was a
possibility of transferring the energy

513
01:18:24,359 --> 01:18:29,158
to the molecules of the water.
I don't understand how.

514
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:36,060
I consider it as not the
proper way of potentization.

515
01:18:40,562 --> 01:18:48,362
Maybe some of you know that I have
given my ideas how to make a robot

516
01:18:49,262 --> 01:18:52,560
so the robot could
potentize properly.

517
01:18:54,658 --> 01:19:04,559
It would hit 10 times, empty, fill, again
potentize 10000 times, 50000 times...

518
01:19:06,362 --> 01:19:11,161
In order to make a 50000 in
this way it needed 2 months.

519
01:19:12,061 --> 01:19:21,662
The robot working day and night. That
would be very expensive potency.

520
01:19:22,261 --> 01:19:29,462
The 50 potency. But once
they made 50000 potency.

521
01:19:30,061 --> 01:19:33,959
From that they could make
as much as they wanted.

522
01:19:34,561 --> 01:19:37,861
So after that they sell
and they can make profit.

523
01:19:39,359 --> 01:19:51,960
So this company was a multinational
company that got involved

524
01:19:53,161 --> 01:20:09,661
with machines of dialysis
and also saline solutions.

525
01:20:12,958 --> 01:20:23,461
They were selling a lot for wars
in Iraq, Iran, became huge company

526
01:20:24,362 --> 01:20:34,261
and most probably they wanted
to have a company in which...

527
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:42,659
I don't know how but they approached me.
They thought it's good business to make.

528
01:20:44,161 --> 01:20:53,459
Tell us how to make good potencies. We have
the technology, we can build the robot.

529
01:20:54,663 --> 01:20:57,060
I said ok bring me the people.

530
01:20:57,962 --> 01:21:03,463
So a team of people came, we
discussed, they produced the robot,

531
01:21:04,958 --> 01:21:15,163
at first the robot was breaking all
the glasses, they corrected it

532
01:21:18,159 --> 01:21:27,161
and then after 9 months
they produced a real robot.

533
01:21:27,761 --> 01:21:32,263
Then I told the students then the
students from different countries

534
01:21:32,861 --> 01:21:39,760
started writing to this company
please I need this remedy. No answer.

535
01:21:41,262 --> 01:21:45,760
Everyone was complaining, I will write
to Cziffra and there was no answer.

536
01:21:47,559 --> 01:21:54,162
I asked them what happens and they
said that according to the Italian law

537
01:21:55,059 --> 01:22:00,759
we are not allowed to sell outside
from Italy this potencies.

538
01:22:01,958 --> 01:22:10,061
I don't know why but in any case
something was wrong with the company

539
01:22:13,661 --> 01:22:21,462
and the chief men went to
jail, sold the company

540
01:22:22,361 --> 01:22:27,158
and this company was bought by
somebody else and then somebody else...

541
01:22:27,761 --> 01:22:34,960
And I am trying to trace who has
my robots and I can't find!

542
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:49,658
At least give me back the robots!
But I can reproduce the robots.

543
01:22:52,361 --> 01:22:54,158
Now they approached me again.

544
01:22:55,060 --> 01:23:02,861
Give us the parameters and we
will produce a robot again.

545
01:23:03,459 --> 01:23:06,461
And I believe I will do it
before I leave this world.

546
01:23:07,058 --> 01:23:15,160
I have to make sure that the remedies which are
prescribed are really potentized remedies.

547
01:23:16,363 --> 01:23:17,561
We have to make sure.

548
01:23:17,859 --> 01:23:19,958
Because you give a 10M
and there is no effect.

549
01:23:20,258 --> 01:23:30,759
How do I know that this is not a well-prepared
remedy or a spoiled remedy or junk?

550
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:40,359
- I wanted to ask about your experience
in high potency of Hahnemannian method

551
01:23:41,259 --> 01:23:48,160
or Korsakoff method.<br/>-
Korsakoff method is perfect.

552
01:23:48,458 --> 01:23:50,558
You don't have to
do Hahnemann's.

553
01:23:51,163 --> 01:24:06,459
Hahnemann means that you have
to empty and use another bottle

554
01:24:07,961 --> 01:24:16,361
and take one drop from this bottle, put
it in the new, shake it, take it one,

555
01:24:16,963 --> 01:24:24,460
empty, throw it away... That means you
will need thousands of little bottles

556
01:24:26,563 --> 01:24:34,962
and would mean you need
double distilled water.

557
01:24:37,961 --> 01:24:40,060
So this is not practical.

558
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:50,863
So the remedies I was using from
this company were really reliable

559
01:24:51,461 --> 01:24:55,358
and were giving
very good results.

560
01:24:56,561 --> 01:25:04,058
If a company say that they are doing
it by hand then I have a problem.

561
01:25:06,163 --> 01:25:08,259
That they don't tell the truth.

562
01:25:09,163 --> 01:25:14,861
These remedies cannot be done
in such high potencies by hand.

563
01:25:16,659 --> 01:25:23,259
Because I have tried myself for a
certain person that I loved very much,

564
01:25:24,161 --> 01:25:28,060
I could not find the remedy and I
tried to make the remedy myself.

565
01:25:28,959 --> 01:25:37,962
And I reached up to 12CH and I broke
my arm because I was hitting too hard.

566
01:25:38,562 --> 01:25:52,961
Can you imagine doing it 1000 times?
You hit 10 times

567
01:25:53,262 --> 01:26:00,162
and you have done one time
and then... 1000 by 20 times

568
01:26:00,462 --> 01:26:04,061
that you will have
to hit this 20000.

569
01:26:11,259 --> 01:26:16,960
Then if your arm still remains in
your shoulder then... good luck!

570
01:26:17,859 --> 01:26:27,163
So if they tell me this is a very good company
because it produces by hand. I say bye.

571
01:26:32,261 --> 01:26:49,062
- In paragraph 269 and 270 Hahnemann describes
how you should do it by hand LM potencies.

572
01:26:49,659 --> 01:26:58,662
And so those potencies in Germany
there are 2 or 3 factories.

573
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:08,660
- 269 and 270."Thus two drops of
the fresh vegetable juice mingled

574
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:13,160
with equal parts of alcohol are diluted
with ninety-eight drops of alcohol

575
01:27:13,759 --> 01:27:18,262
and potentized by means of two succussions,
whereby the first development of power

576
01:27:18,859 --> 01:27:25,460
is formed and this process is repeated
through twenty-nine more phials,

577
01:27:26,362 --> 01:27:31,762
each of which is filled three-quarters
full with ninety-nine drops of alcohol,

578
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:39,859
and each succeeding phial is to be provided
with one drop from the preceding phial..."

579
01:27:40,461 --> 01:27:47,960
This is what the call
Hahnemannian potency.

580
01:27:50,061 --> 01:28:00,561
And there is story if you do the Hahnemannian
potency and you do it up to 12CH

581
01:28:02,062 --> 01:28:04,461
then it is equal to 200CH.

582
01:28:06,860 --> 01:28:11,362
The pharmacies say so in order to
sell the potencies. This is not true.

583
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:18,861
More or less the potency is the same
whether it is made by changing the phials

584
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:31,159
or by emptying and filling because when you
empty and you turn it back on the tube

585
01:28:30,856 --> 01:28:44,657
there is one drop left of the sides so by
refilling it you have this mixture quite good,

586
01:28:45,253 --> 01:28:54,558
not only that but according to a study that
we have done and published back in the 1980s,

587
01:28:56,058 --> 01:29:06,858
you may find it in my website, we have
found out according to a theory in physics

588
01:29:08,356 --> 01:29:23,058
which is for small clusters, when
the dilution of substance is done

589
01:29:24,556 --> 01:29:35,055
then the molecules tend to stick
to the periphery of the vial.

590
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:39,856
They don't stay floating around.
They stick.

591
01:29:41,953 --> 01:29:51,555
That was an idea which gave us that
the Korsakoff method is quite good.

592
01:29:53,653 --> 01:30:02,954
Because in the periphery stuck on
the glass are the most clusters,

593
01:30:07,158 --> 01:30:17,354
that means groups of molecules, in
the beginning and as it goes on

594
01:30:19,758 --> 01:30:29,656
there are clathrates
that means a kind of...

595
01:30:40,757 --> 01:31:03,854
Instead of the real molecules the clathrates
seems to have the structure of the molecule

596
01:31:05,957 --> 01:31:08,357
without the molecule.

597
01:31:11,658 --> 01:31:23,353
The molecule is now missing but what is left
is the clathrates that means... Hologram.

598
01:31:30,856 --> 01:31:34,455
They call in
clathrates in physics.

599
01:31:36,858 --> 01:31:49,754
This is what most probably happens in
potentizing with this kind of potentization.

600
01:31:56,357 --> 01:32:04,453
This is one problem that I have
in my mind, we have to solve,

601
01:32:06,256 --> 01:32:12,556
to have standardized quality
of the homeopathic remedies.

602
01:32:13,456 --> 01:32:20,957
If everybody follows the same rules then
we have a standardized homeopathic remedy.

603
01:32:21,256 --> 01:32:27,854
Otherwise each one following
his own rules... it's no good.

604
01:32:30,853 --> 01:32:34,055
You may see an effect
with the one or the other

605
01:32:35,254 --> 01:32:40,054
but still we don't have a
standardized type of medication.
