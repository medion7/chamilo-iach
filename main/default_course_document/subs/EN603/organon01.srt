1
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:37,701
We have spoken up to paragraph 90. The last paragraphs 82 up to 89 were speaking

2
00:00:37,901 --> 00:00:46,058
about the taking of the case and what you have to pay attention to.

3
00:00:51,884 --> 00:00:58,946
It's very interesting in paragraph 87, I don't remember if I commented on that,

4
00:00:59,146 --> 00:01:10,188
he says "For instance the physician should not ask, was not this or that circumstance

5
00:01:10,388 --> 00:01:26,939
present..." That means you should not suggest to the patient the condition.

6
00:01:27,139 --> 00:01:38,204
Did you have a condition like this or that by the time... suggesting yourself to the mind

7
00:01:38,404 --> 00:01:46,595
of the patient something which may not be there because the patient may accept

8
00:01:46,795 --> 00:01:53,177
that this was so while this is not true.

9
00:01:55,870 --> 00:02:07,071
"He should never be guilty of making such suggestions". Many times you are thinking

10
00:02:07,271 --> 00:02:17,219
this is Calc. carbonica so you need that the patient will tell you that he has fear

11
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:28,701
of high places. So if you put it in this way "you have fear of high places" suggesting

12
00:02:28,901 --> 00:02:41,497
to the patient, not asking but suggesting, the patient himself if he is of a weak

13
00:02:41,697 --> 00:02:54,376
character, he may think maybe there was one time that I was in a high places

14
00:02:54,576 --> 00:03:01,619
and...yes. So he gives you a positive answer because you suggested it, not because

15
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:14,304
the symptom exists. Hahnemann is very careful in these matters. "...which tend to

16
00:03:14,504 --> 00:03:25,347
seduce the patient into giving a false answer and a false account of his symptoms."

17
00:03:26,988 --> 00:03:44,783
So suggesting is to be avoided. He speaks of the details for which you have to get

18
00:03:44,983 --> 00:04:01,970
information and in paragraph 89 just before the one that we are just to connect.

19
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:12,356
"For example, how often are his bowels moved? What is the exact character of

20
00:04:12,556 --> 00:04:21,410
the stool? Did the whitish evacuation consist of mucus or feces?

21
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:30,610
Had he or had he not pains during the evacuation? What was their exact character

22
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:39,596
and where were they seated? What did the patient vomit? Is the bad taste in the

23
00:04:39,796 --> 00:04:45,017
mouth putrid, or bitter, or sour, or what?"

24
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:57,404
If you read carefully the Organon, you will see that he leaves nothing to chance.

25
00:04:57,604 --> 00:05:03,850
He takes all possibilities, all the mistakes we may make when we take a case

26
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:16,409
and he gives precise information. Later on he will give the qualities of

27
00:05:16,609 --> 00:05:27,501
the homeopath who is doing the investigation and the qualities are quite high.

28
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:46,532
In order to take a real case the homeopath must be quite a wise man already.

29
00:05:46,732 --> 00:05:50,669
That is a problem of course...

30
00:05:50,869 --> 00:06:02,866
He goes on to paragraph 90. "When the physician has finished writing down

31
00:06:03,066 --> 00:06:15,830
these particulars..." A lot of these particulars you can go and study in the notes

32
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:25,414
"he then makes a note of what he himself observes in the patient".

33
00:06:25,614 --> 00:06:33,625
For example, how the patient behaved during the visit - whether he was morose,

34
00:06:33,825 --> 00:06:45,169
quarrelsome, hasty, lachrymose, anxious, despairing or sad, or hopeful, calm etc."

35
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:55,913
The information has to be complete with the observation of the physician.

36
00:07:01,725 --> 00:07:12,701
In paragraph 91. "The symptoms and feelings of the patient during a previous course

37
00:07:12,901 --> 00:07:21,651
of medicine do not furnish the pure picture of the disease." Here is the case where

38
00:07:21,851 --> 00:07:35,039
you have a patient coming to you and he has been taking allopathic drugs and

39
00:07:35,239 --> 00:07:47,959
he comes under the drugs and Hahnemann says the symptoms that were before

40
00:07:48,159 --> 00:08:01,111
taking the remedies do not give you the exact form of the disease you are going

41
00:08:01,311 --> 00:08:11,996
to treat. He says be careful. Before taking the remedies what were the symptoms?

42
00:08:12,196 --> 00:08:20,283
And you may come to the conclusion he says that this is the remedy.

43
00:08:20,483 --> 00:08:24,766
He says not always.

44
00:08:28,358 --> 00:08:36,263
"do not furnish the pure picture of the disease; but on the other hand,

45
00:08:36,463 --> 00:08:43,810
those symptoms and ailments which he suffered from before the use of

46
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:54,557
the medicines, or after they had been discontinued for several days, give the true

47
00:08:54,757 --> 00:09:00,794
fundamental idea of the original form of the disease", "but on the other hand,

48
00:09:00,994 --> 00:09:07,707
those symptoms and ailments which he suffered from before the use of

49
00:09:07,907 --> 00:09:19,976
the medicines, or after they had been discontinued" then you have the real picture.

50
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:34,438
What he says is you take the symptoms before, you discontinue his drugs and see

51
00:09:34,638 --> 00:09:46,216
what is after. So what is after and what was before combined then you have a good

52
00:09:46,416 --> 00:10:01,980
picture of the situation. There he speaks about usual cases that we have with

53
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:09,948
the modern drugs that people are taking.

54
00:10:10,148 --> 00:10:19,327
Most of the people are taking allopathic drugs when they come to Homeopathy.

55
00:10:19,527 --> 00:10:27,771
"and these especially the physician must take note of.

56
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:43,665
When the disease is of a chronic character, and the patient has been taking medicine

57
00:10:43,865 --> 00:10:54,138
up to the time he is seen" until the day he comes to us he still takes the remedies

58
00:10:54,338 --> 00:11:05,921
"the physician may with advantage leave him some days quite without medicine".

59
00:11:06,121 --> 00:11:11,746
So he says that the best you can do if this case is chronic is tell him to stop the

60
00:11:11,946 --> 00:11:20,039
medication for a few days and that will be to the advantage of your case, tell him

61
00:11:20,239 --> 00:11:31,487
to stop the medication and now he suggests what to do "or in the meantime

62
00:11:31,687 --> 00:11:44,936
administer something of unmedicinal nature". Give him some placebo.

63
00:11:45,136 --> 00:11:54,262
Tell him take this now, stop the medicine and come after 15 days to see you.

64
00:11:54,462 --> 00:11:58,634
Question.

65
00:11:58,834 --> 00:12:04,149
-What shall I do with patient who is taking drugs for his high blood pressure,

66
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:07,377
for diabetes?

67
00:12:07,577 --> 00:12:24,900
-I will speak about that. And send the patient on another period "and defer to a

68
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:35,507
subsequent period the more precise scrutiny...". Do not take details at that moment.

69
00:12:35,707 --> 00:12:43,547
You take a few symptoms and you say OK I will give you a remedy now and in 15 days

70
00:12:43,747 --> 00:13:09,164
I have to see you again. Take placebo. "...in order to be able to grasp in their purity

71
00:13:09,364 --> 00:13:20,799
the permanent uncontaminated symptoms of the old affection and to form a faithful

72
00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:42,272
picture of the disease". He says do not rely on the picture he had while taking

73
00:13:42,472 --> 00:13:46,412
the remedy, this it is not enough, because the effect of the drugs may have changed

74
00:13:46,612 --> 00:13:57,522
the nature of the disease. That means he has made the situation deeper and difficult

75
00:13:57,722 --> 00:14:09,842
most probably. And that is why you should wait and see the changes that were made

76
00:14:10,042 --> 00:14:16,226
by the drugs that he was taking.

77
00:14:22,367 --> 00:14:35,520
Hahnemann speaks at the end of the 18th century.

78
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:48,587
What were the drugs he was taking by that time? They had not the type of drugs that

79
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:54,977
we have today which affect the organism much deeper and make an organism

80
00:14:55,177 --> 00:15:03,632
to depend on such drugs.

81
00:15:03,832 --> 00:15:13,821
Because when somebody is taking cortisone, they have discovered that

82
00:15:14,021 --> 00:15:29,761
the suprarenal glands in cases of crisis they exude cortisone and therefore flowing

83
00:15:29,961 --> 00:15:42,333
of cortisone in the blood is a link on a chain of the defense of the organism.

84
00:15:42,533 --> 00:15:58,342
An important link, but it is only a link. If the person is taking cortisone, what happens?

85
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:07,667
The clever physician has given a replacement of what the organism should have done.

86
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:16,218
The organism should have raised the amount of cortisone into the blood up to

87
00:16:16,418 --> 00:16:24,891
a certain extent. The physician does not know to what extent was necessary.

88
00:16:25,091 --> 00:16:39,099
So he says take 20mg of cortisone. But maybe the organism needs only 3mg in order

89
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:51,318
to overcome. By giving 20mg it replaces the functions of the suprarenal glands and

90
00:16:51,518 --> 00:16:58,869
they say oh my God there is too much cortisone into the blood, I stop.

91
00:17:01,099 --> 00:17:12,945
So they nullify the function of the suprarenal glands because the organism knows

92
00:17:13,145 --> 00:17:19,523
what is going on. You don't need to produce at all.

93
00:17:19,723 --> 00:17:29,428
But if you do it for a long period of time the suprarenal glands cease to function.

94
00:17:29,628 --> 00:17:40,301
So he comes to you and you say according to Hahnemann, stop the drug and

95
00:17:40,501 --> 00:17:50,301
I will see you in 20 days but actually what is going to happen is that there is

96
00:17:50,501 --> 00:17:58,550
no cortisone, the suprarenal glands will not start automatically producing because

97
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:10,287
they have ceased due to the use of cortisone from outside.

98
00:18:10,487 --> 00:18:23,654
Therefore the conditions that we have to face as homeopaths at this moment

99
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:33,431
concerning the allopathic drugs is much more complicated than Hahnemann had

100
00:18:33,631 --> 00:18:38,410
when he was writing the Organon.

101
00:18:39,804 --> 00:18:50,639
We have managed to find drugs for high blood pressure.

102
00:18:55,121 --> 00:19:03,816
But has anybody seen a cure by these drugs?

103
00:19:04,016 --> 00:19:19,496
Now you take 50mg of this anti-hypertensive drug, after 2 years he needs 60mg and

104
00:19:19,696 --> 00:19:30,250
then after 2 years 100mg. That means something is going on which we don't know.

105
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:40,280
What is that we don't know? Is that the organism has decided to raise the blood

106
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:48,259
pressure because of certain reasons. We come with the drug and say we don't allow

107
00:19:48,459 --> 00:19:56,708
you to rise the blood pressure because it's dangerous for the patient he will have

108
00:19:56,908 --> 00:19:59,543
a brain stroke.

109
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:11,253
And the patient believes it and he starts taking the anti-hypertensive drugs.

110
00:20:11,453 --> 00:20:19,468
But what is the mechanism that brings down the organism?

111
00:20:19,668 --> 00:20:30,468
We have to conclude that because there is no cure if one takes anti-hypertensive

112
00:20:30,668 --> 00:20:38,983
drugs even for a long time. On the contrary they need more and more remedies

113
00:20:39,183 --> 00:20:44,015
and sometimes the drug stops working and they need another drug, sometimes

114
00:20:44,215 --> 00:20:54,570
they combine 2 drugs together to keep the blood pressure low...

115
00:20:54,770 --> 00:21:01,094
He comes to us and we say stop the anti-hypertensive drugs because I want

116
00:21:01,294 --> 00:21:28,676
to observe what is the real nature of your disease. "...to form a faithful picture of

117
00:21:28,876 --> 00:21:38,429
the disease." Hahnemann could say that because there was no danger.

118
00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:51,573
What they were doing was bloodletting, taking some herbs, things that were not

119
00:21:51,773 --> 00:22:01,715
deforming the disease per se but the symptoms a little bit.

120
00:22:02,276 --> 00:22:10,371
Here we deform the disease. That means before the allopathic drugs

121
00:22:11,844 --> 00:22:18,427
there is a disease, after the allopathic drugs there is a disease plus.

122
00:22:18,627 --> 00:22:24,067
the effect of the chemical drug.

123
00:22:24,267 --> 00:22:32,619
So we have to be careful and understand the conditions under which Hahnemann

124
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:41,491
was working. But listen to this now it's very interesting...

125
00:22:41,691 --> 00:22:46,020
Because Hahnemann never left anything out.

126
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:59,637
In paragraph 92 he says "But if it be a disease of a rapid course" that means a disease

127
00:23:02,376 --> 00:23:19,628
which develops rapidly "and if its serious character admit of no delay, the physician

128
00:23:19,828 --> 00:23:28,920
must content himself with observing the morbid condition, altered though it may be

129
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:38,519
by medicines". The physician cannot anymore say stop the medicine. He must accept

130
00:23:38,719 --> 00:23:46,582
that the picture he has in front of him, that's it. He must be content with that.

131
00:23:46,782 --> 00:23:53,475
Can you do something with this? You cannot stop the medication, it's dangerous.

132
00:23:53,675 --> 00:24:02,010
The disease is going to develop. He speaks of another type of pathology which existed

133
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:11,378
by that time but if we had to transfer it to our contemporary situation,

134
00:24:11,578 --> 00:24:22,296
what do we know is that when a person takes a drug,

135
00:24:22,687 --> 00:24:37,267
especially on account of his cardiac situation, we better be careful

136
00:24:37,467 --> 00:24:46,986
to not stop the drug but be content he takes now a drug for thinning the blood

137
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:53,267
and a drug for high blood pressure and a drug for this and that...

138
00:24:53,467 --> 00:25:02,906
Just don't go and stop all these and take the placebo and I'll see you

139
00:25:03,106 --> 00:25:16,994
in the next world... We meet on the next stage.

140
00:25:17,194 --> 00:25:26,292
The Indians believe it is good if the physician helps a person go to the next stage,

141
00:25:26,492 --> 00:25:36,778
has helped him to go quickly to one more cycle... This is accepted.

142
00:25:36,978 --> 00:25:49,751
Death in Indian tradition, at least in the 1960s, this was accepted as a phenomenon

143
00:25:49,951 --> 00:26:04,646
of the cycle of life in which a person through suffering in this life

144
00:26:04,846 --> 00:26:15,158
becomes more and more spiritually evolved. The idea is to be similar with God.

145
00:26:15,358 --> 00:26:33,890
But God is full of love, justice, energy, knowledge. Actually you have to be having

146
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:51,304
all these qualities to be in connection with God. How can you attain these qualities?

147
00:26:51,504 --> 00:27:02,781
Only through reincarnation. Therefore if I give you a remedy and you die I helped you

148
00:27:02,981 --> 00:27:18,068
to go quickly to the next cycle. Here it is different with western societies.

149
00:27:18,268 --> 00:27:33,090
We consider life as the greatest thing. Somebody dies because of mistake of a M.D.

150
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:39,746
He's finished. He will never have again a chance. Just one mistake that comes to

151
00:27:39,946 --> 00:27:48,982
the public. You see how the society is hypocritical.

152
00:27:48,755 --> 00:28:00,472
Because there are at the same time millions of people dying because of wars,

153
00:28:00,672 --> 00:28:05,869
of famine, of atrocities which the human mind has produced in order to kill each other

154
00:28:06,069 --> 00:28:10,823
and because the M.D. made the mistake and he should have given this remedy

155
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:19,884
instead of that, then it becomes a big thing in the society.

156
00:28:20,084 --> 00:28:27,321
We have to face it as homeopaths, this is the reality.

157
00:28:27,521 --> 00:28:34,990
Because if you make a mistake as a homeopath, they will kill you.

158
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:46,405
Even as a M.D. where it is accepted to give remedies that kill the patient.

159
00:28:50,209 --> 00:28:59,093
Actually there was a research in the American Medical Association Journal in 2000

160
00:28:59,293 --> 00:29:17,535
which proved that the number 1 death situation was people who were taking

161
00:29:17,735 --> 00:29:29,366
faithfully their allopathic drugs. Despite the fact they found they were getting

162
00:29:29,566 --> 00:29:38,050
worse and worse, they kept on taking them... Bye bye! Finished!

163
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:57,010
2085 deaths from iatrogenic diseases. It means we gave you too much drugs and

164
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:05,755
we killed you.

165
00:30:05,955 --> 00:30:20,439
Those of us who want to go according to the teachings of Hahnemann we have to be

166
00:30:20,639 --> 00:30:30,332
sensible and understand that we are living in a society under certain conditions and

167
00:30:30,532 --> 00:30:42,724
also in a time where the medical structure has found chemical drugs that can affect

168
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:49,695
very deeply the human body. Therefore we cannot do that very easily.

169
00:30:49,895 --> 00:30:53,658
But in certain cases we can.

170
00:30:53,858 --> 00:31:00,555
If we feel there is no danger of life of course we can do it.

171
00:31:00,755 --> 00:31:08,375
But most of the times he says you have to give a remedy while the person

172
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:21,824
is under drugs. Because if you stop it, the disease is very rapid and he will go.

173
00:31:35,913 --> 00:31:41,143
"if he cannot ascertain what symptoms were present before the employment of

174
00:31:41,343 --> 00:31:49,504
the medicines, - in order that he may at least form a just apprehension of

175
00:31:49,704 --> 00:31:54,204
the complete picture of the disease in its actual condition, that is to say,

176
00:31:54,404 --> 00:32:02,186
of the conjoint malady formed by the medicinal and original diseases, which from

177
00:32:02,386 --> 00:32:09,231
the use of inappropriate drugs is generally more serious and dangerous than was

178
00:32:09,431 --> 00:32:12,700
the original disease."

179
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:17,208
That means by giving the drugs the condition has become more serious

180
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:24,795
and more dangerous. "and hence demands prompt and efficient aid"

181
00:32:24,995 --> 00:32:34,693
immediately after you give the remedy... but your remedy has to be - if possible -

182
00:32:34,893 --> 00:32:46,061
based on what symptoms he may had before the taking of the drugs.

183
00:32:48,191 --> 00:32:55,366
In such a case you have no other option but to take the present situation.

184
00:32:55,566 --> 00:33:12,245
What there is under the drugs. But also try to see if before taking the medicine

185
00:33:12,445 --> 00:33:18,566
was a picture of a remedy and base it on that.

186
00:33:21,973 --> 00:33:34,847
You most probably have heard a case of mine that I treated in Houston in America

187
00:33:35,047 --> 00:33:45,519
with transplanted aorta and the patient went into coma in Houston.

188
00:33:45,719 --> 00:33:52,408
He remained 3 months in a coma in Houston and they transferred him to

189
00:33:52,608 --> 00:33:58,173
the Greek hospital in order to die in his country.

190
00:33:58,373 --> 00:34:06,371
By that time his daughter came and said George can you do something?

191
00:34:06,571 --> 00:34:14,115
I said no of course. But they insisted and I said Ok , let me go and see this guy in

192
00:34:14,315 --> 00:34:26,822
the hospital. I went and saw him and I saw some signs and I could see the remedy.

193
00:34:31,353 --> 00:34:37,928
In the meantime, I forgot to tell you, this woman together with her husband

194
00:34:38,128 --> 00:34:42,379
who was a professor in the University , they went to the doctors and said

195
00:34:42,579 --> 00:34:45,024
what is the situation.

196
00:34:45,224 --> 00:34:49,703
The doctors said that it's a matter of 2-3 days, no more.

197
00:34:52,026 --> 00:35:00,555
Everybody knew the patient is going to die in 3 days at most.

198
00:35:00,755 --> 00:35:14,789
Ok then, if they agree to take out all medications, because there was a rejection

199
00:35:14,989 --> 00:35:36,788
process of the implant, then I will prescribe. This professor said Ok Vithoulkas

200
00:35:36,988 --> 00:35:45,852
will come to treat the case. But you have to take out all your medication.

201
00:35:51,836 --> 00:36:00,462
The doctor said if I knew the situation was different, that means there was

202
00:36:00,662 --> 00:36:05,878
any possibility the patient may survive, I would be very offended of what you are

203
00:36:06,078 --> 00:36:17,929
telling me now but I will agree to withdraw all the medications.

204
00:36:21,643 --> 00:36:27,879
In such a situation I took the chance of course but I knew they could do

205
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,593
nothing more.

206
00:36:33,146 --> 00:36:39,867
The man lived ten more years, he was 72 he lived up to 82, he was driving his car,

207
00:36:40,067 --> 00:36:47,114
he was happy and every year he was coming and giving me a present, because

208
00:36:47,314 --> 00:36:57,159
he was still alive. Quite a lot of presents, he appreciated.

209
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:04,368
It was a tremendous situation I went through but I had to be very careful, and I made

210
00:37:04,568 --> 00:37:09,243
a mistake in prescribing, at the moment I prescribed the wrong medication,

211
00:37:09,443 --> 00:37:21,048
the blood pressure went up but he came out of the coma in 12 days.

212
00:37:25,817 --> 00:37:32,695
This professor with his car took him home where I continue treating him.

213
00:37:36,815 --> 00:37:43,386
All the doctors who were attending because his kidneys were breaking down,

214
00:37:43,586 --> 00:37:53,080
the vascular system was so sclerosed and all that, he was in a terrible situation.

215
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,877
All these doctors disappeared, they never came back while I was treating him

216
00:37:58,077 --> 00:38:05,936
for 12 days. Not one doctor came to see how this guy was doing

217
00:38:06,136 --> 00:38:20,784
that Vithoulkas is treating, I am talking about '79.

218
00:38:20,984 --> 00:38:30,905
After this all these doctors who attended, the nephrologist, the cardiologist,

219
00:38:31,105 --> 00:38:36,839
the internist, there were 4 doctors attending the case before... none of them came

220
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:45,950
to ask what the hell have you done? Is there something that we don't know maybe?

221
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:53,844
Not one of them. A month later I played a trick, because the patient was feeling

222
00:38:54,044 --> 00:39:07,013
quite good and some edema was in his ankles, I said please call the cardiologist

223
00:39:07,213 --> 00:39:15,545
to tell us because I want to know why this edema continues.

224
00:39:17,907 --> 00:39:28,838
The cardiologist comes, knocks the door and says I am cardiologist and I would like

225
00:39:29,038 --> 00:39:39,927
to see the patient Mr... The patient says I am Mr...

226
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:50,522
From the state of coma, in which he was, could not recognize him now as a human

227
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:55,243
being standing in front of him. He said not you, the patient.

228
00:39:55,443 --> 00:40:03,422
He said I am the patient. You are the patient? What can I do for you?

229
00:40:03,622 --> 00:40:15,030
He said my doctor Mr. Vithoulkas wants to know why I still have this little edema

230
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:23,361
in my ankles. And he would like a report from you.

231
00:40:23,561 --> 00:40:34,212
They have taken a lot of money until that moment when I interfered.

232
00:40:34,412 --> 00:40:41,258
The poor doctor of course called me. I heard him saying well Mr. Vithoulkas

233
00:40:41,458 --> 00:40:51,336
you have done a little miracle. I said yes a small miracle.

234
00:40:51,536 --> 00:40:59,193
These edemas in the ankles is nothing, don't worry about that.

235
00:40:59,393 --> 00:41:05,771
I said thank you for your advice.

236
00:41:05,971 --> 00:41:11,035
Unless we do things like that, people will not realize the importance of what

237
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:22,220
we are doing. There is no possibility. They just go on...

238
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:28,421
I remember another case giving all kinds of medications for a case of constant fever.

239
00:41:28,621 --> 00:41:39,895
She has been in Austria, has been in different hospitals.

240
00:41:40,095 --> 00:41:57,936
Her husband was a lawyer in Areios Pagos, the supreme court.

241
00:41:58,136 --> 00:42:10,578
They came to me in '71, I was 2-3 years in Greece and my husband is

242
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:16,904
in supreme court and I am taking cortisone and I am still having the fever.

243
00:42:17,104 --> 00:42:23,411
What shall I do? Shall I stop the medication?

244
00:42:23,611 --> 00:42:30,962
I felt there was no danger for her life so I said Ok you stop the medication and

245
00:42:31,162 --> 00:42:42,000
I will treat you. She said there are 10 doctors who are attending me.

246
00:42:44,277 --> 00:42:49,856
I was under attack already before starting the case.

247
00:42:50,056 --> 00:42:59,048
I prescribed the remedy, in one month the fever disappeared.

248
00:42:59,248 --> 00:43:11,040
What was the remedy? I think Ferrum phosphoricum. Just one remedy.

249
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:20,041
She came to me very happy and at the second month very happy and at the third

250
00:43:20,241 --> 00:43:28,321
month no fever, very happy, the fourth month she says I will tell you a phenomenon

251
00:43:28,521 --> 00:43:38,587
which I observed, I told all of them that you are going to treat me.

252
00:43:38,787 --> 00:43:50,729
In the first ten days all of them, almost every day they would call me, how are you,

253
00:43:50,929 --> 00:44:03,979
as I started telling them I am better the 10 became 9, the 9 became 8 and so on and

254
00:44:04,179 --> 00:44:14,936
in the end remained only one who would like to call you.

255
00:44:15,136 --> 00:44:19,324
Would you please talk to him? I said yes, of course.

256
00:44:19,524 --> 00:44:30,079
He asked me what I did, what was your diagnosis? I told him I will not tell you

257
00:44:30,279 --> 00:44:34,577
the diagnosis, I will tell you only the remedy. I gave Ferrum phosphoricum.

258
00:44:34,777 --> 00:44:45,197
What is it? It doesn't matter, it's difficult for me to explain but this is the situation.

259
00:44:45,397 --> 00:44:54,567
He says can I come to your lectures? I said of course every Monday I give lectures

260
00:44:54,767 --> 00:44:56,082
to the Greek doctors, you can come.

261
00:44:56,282 --> 00:45:03,219
He came 2-3 times and he said goodbye and never came back.

262
00:45:03,419 --> 00:45:11,615
All these phenomena which are happening under homeopathic treatment and which

263
00:45:11,815 --> 00:45:18,097
sometimes are really impressive are not being considered.

264
00:45:18,297 --> 00:45:29,559
Such a callous situation that it's very difficult for us to deal with.

265
00:45:34,310 --> 00:46:05,189
So Mr. Hahnemann was saying "...demands prompt and efficient aid; and by thus

266
00:46:05,389 --> 00:46:13,344
tracing out the complete picture of the disease he will be enabled to combat it with

267
00:46:13,544 --> 00:46:28,013
a suitable homoeopathic remedy, so that the patient shall not fall a sacrifice to

268
00:46:28,213 --> 00:46:37,439
the injurious drugs he was swallowed."

269
00:46:37,639 --> 00:46:50,371
He considered that the victim was actually a victim of the medical people.

270
00:46:55,977 --> 00:47:05,808
Paragraph 93. "If the disease has been brought on a short time or, in the case of

271
00:47:06,008 --> 00:47:17,357
a chronic affection, a considerable time previously, by some obvious cause,

272
00:47:17,557 --> 00:47:26,058
then the patient - or his friends when questioned privately - will mention it either

273
00:47:26,258 --> 00:47:31,515
spontaneously or when carefully interrogated".

274
00:47:31,715 --> 00:47:38,829
"If the disease has been brought on a short time or, in the case of a chronic affection,

275
00:47:39,029 --> 00:47:47,083
a considerable time previously, by some obvious cause..." That means if what you are

276
00:47:47,283 --> 00:47:58,567
facing today is a chronic condition which was coming from a specific cause

277
00:47:58,767 --> 00:48:09,479
you have to find out which the cause was that brought this condition.

278
00:48:17,731 --> 00:48:29,142
Either the patient will say it spontaneously or when carefully interrogated.

279
00:48:30,694 --> 00:48:39,595
"Any causes of a disgraceful character, which the patient or his friends do not like

280
00:48:39,795 --> 00:48:53,219
to confess, at least not voluntarily, the physician must endeavor to elicit by skillfully

281
00:48:53,419 --> 00:49:04,133
framing his questions, or by private information."

282
00:49:08,783 --> 00:49:16,555
There is a couple that has come and the woman is having the problem and you

283
00:49:16,755 --> 00:49:26,471
suspect that the woman has a problem because she falls in love with another man

284
00:49:26,671 --> 00:49:35,484
and now she is in a great conflict what to do. Shall I divorce my husband who is so

285
00:49:35,684 --> 00:49:48,095
nice or should I stay with him and forget the man with whom I feel Ok?

286
00:49:51,958 --> 00:50:00,123
That is a disgraceful cause. You cannot elicit it in front of the husband.

287
00:50:00,323 --> 00:50:13,557
Take the woman privately and ask. This problem is greater when I take a case

288
00:50:13,757 --> 00:50:30,597
because everybody is listening. There is an extra difficulty for me to elicit such causes

289
00:50:30,797 --> 00:50:42,205
but those who were previously attending the course they found out in 2 cases,

290
00:50:42,405 --> 00:50:54,822
there was defamation, unjustly accused people who are destroyed by this defamation

291
00:50:55,022 --> 00:51:03,267
and were able to discuss and to say what was actually happening.

292
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:18,809
Then you take into consideration this cause. You take it together with details of

293
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:36,488
the rest of the case. A cause can bring out on an individual a certain disease picture

294
00:51:36,688 --> 00:51:46,270
and the same cause - defamation or jealousy- can bring out a different picture on

295
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:53,198
a different individual. You have to be careful of that.

296
00:51:53,398 --> 00:51:59,272
It does not mean because you know the cause, you will always give Ignatia.

297
00:52:03,722 --> 00:52:14,014
"...at least not voluntarily, the physician must endeavor to elicit by skilfully framing

298
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:24,891
his questions, or by private information. To these belong poisoning or attempted

299
00:52:25,091 --> 00:52:35,945
suicide..." It's difficult for a person to say I have attempted suicide because I lost

300
00:52:36,145 --> 00:52:49,400
my lover... These are difficult things to confess and people keep them for themselves.

301
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:59,513
And we have to be very skillful in eliciting this, in understanding what is going on

302
00:52:59,713 --> 00:53:12,359
most probably. Sometimes the cause of the manifestation of a tumor in the breast of

303
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:19,305
a woman will be the conflict in her marriage.

304
00:53:19,505 --> 00:53:29,079
Because during the marriage she fell in love with somebody else and the attraction

305
00:53:29,279 --> 00:53:39,795
is so great that the hormones are changing completely. With her husband it was Ok.

306
00:53:39,995 --> 00:53:48,626
But with this where the hormones are flooding the brain and stimulating it but

307
00:53:48,826 --> 00:54:02,460
cannot be satisfied, the problem becomes tremendous within the organism and

308
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:14,596
the flooding of the hormones and the resistance of the person not to submit

309
00:54:14,796 --> 00:54:29,977
to this new situation suddenly brings out a tumor in the breast.

310
00:54:30,177 --> 00:54:48,415
The medicine that always knows everything they call it hormonally dependent cancer.

311
00:54:48,615 --> 00:54:59,859
They like to have a name. But when there is a hormonally dependent cancer

312
00:55:00,059 --> 00:55:10,720
you know that most probably there is a problem of not allowing the organism to

313
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:20,285
let out the extra hormones which are produced for one reason or another.

314
00:55:32,047 --> 00:55:57,932
"...onanism, masturbation...indulgence [...] excess in wine [...], coffee [...] infection

315
00:55:58,132 --> 00:56:05,421
with venereal disease..." The fact that somebody has been infected by venereal

316
00:56:05,621 --> 00:56:14,514
disease, the doctor immediately will suppose that the man or the woman had been

317
00:56:14,714 --> 00:56:20,733
gone in places not so clean to have sex.

318
00:56:20,933 --> 00:56:27,257
That immediately brings a shame to the individual and will keep it inside.

319
00:56:27,457 --> 00:56:37,406
So you have to elicit by skillfully preparing questions, otherwise...

320
00:56:37,606 --> 00:56:48,883
I told you the case of a Greek general who was very religious and had a group

321
00:56:49,083 --> 00:56:58,560
following him. He was a general in pension.

322
00:57:01,377 --> 00:57:10,384
He had a rhinitis and the symptoms indicated definitely infection with gonorrhea.

323
00:57:11,722 --> 00:57:24,526
He was saying for himself what a great person he is, followers are believing in him...

324
00:57:28,994 --> 00:57:34,500
I said now I have to confirm. How shall I ask him? If I asked him directly, did you have

325
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:45,061
had a gonorrheal infection? He was in that exciting state he would say no of course.

326
00:57:45,261 --> 00:57:50,910
You can never get a positive answer in such a situation. So I said to him,

327
00:57:51,110 --> 00:58:00,602
did you get gonorrhea when you were 21 or 22? 21, he said!

328
00:58:00,802 --> 00:58:08,581
He couldn't have time to think the question. Take Medorrhinum.

329
00:58:08,781 --> 00:58:16,879
He was sending us cases after that. I said why didn't he come to tell us how he is.

330
00:58:17,079 --> 00:58:23,211
He's very well said everyone of his friends that were coming.

331
00:58:23,411 --> 00:58:33,898
I said to one of them why doesn't he come to tell us? Maybe he needs another remedy.

332
00:58:35,643 --> 00:58:45,623
He says that you asked him some very peculiar questions he did not like.

333
00:58:45,823 --> 00:58:55,879
I said I know, they were very peculiar. In his mind he could not believe that I could

334
00:58:56,079 --> 00:59:05,155
know that this had taken place. The question was really beyond his comprehension.

335
00:59:05,355 --> 00:59:13,286
Why suddenly somebody asked me did you get gonorrhea at 21 or 22?

336
00:59:16,252 --> 00:59:28,109
Because I expected more or less the age, I am not a magician but I know the age

337
00:59:28,309 --> 00:59:31,977
that the hormones are very strong and most probably he went to a prostitute

338
00:59:32,177 --> 00:59:34,708
and he got gonorrhea.

339
00:59:34,908 --> 00:59:40,741
And now he is a general, that means he's a strong person with a lot of testosterone.

340
00:59:40,941 --> 00:59:49,817
People who want to put down others etc. All this was automatic.

341
00:59:50,017 --> 00:59:55,943
He thought what the hell, what is this question? But afterwards he did not have time

342
00:59:56,143 --> 01:00:00,748
at the moment to respond. He responded immediately.

343
01:00:00,948 --> 01:00:06,459
And of course saved his life as well.

344
01:00:06,659 --> 01:00:12,132
Because if somebody has a rhinitis, you do not give Medorrhinum.

345
01:00:12,332 --> 01:00:21,933
I can't remember something else which I had found. Questions.

346
01:00:22,133 --> 01:00:29,350
-If we have a case of tumor of the breast of a woman who is emotionally frustrated

347
01:00:29,550 --> 01:00:36,396
in the marriage what could we expect to be done by the correct remedy?

348
01:00:36,596 --> 01:00:52,386
-If the organism is not undermined a lot, you may expect to have a cure.

349
01:00:52,586 --> 01:01:00,601
If the organism is a sensitive organism which has been undermined already quite

350
01:01:01,994 --> 01:01:08,601
a lot, you may expect that the tumor will have a metastatic nature

351
01:01:08,801 --> 01:01:11,694
and it will metastase.

352
01:01:11,894 --> 01:01:18,840
Maybe with the correct remedy we will delay the metastasis instead of after

353
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:26,654
3 months, the metastasis may take 3 years. But still the metastasis will occur.

354
01:01:26,854 --> 01:01:32,544
-When the situation continues, the woman is frustrated and the frustration continues

355
01:01:32,744 --> 01:01:40,655
after the treatment, is there a possibility of frequent relapses because of that?

356
01:01:48,254 --> 01:01:52,456
We gave the right remedy...

357
01:01:56,076 --> 01:02:02,359
-If there is a possibility of relapse? Yes of course. Especially if the condition of the

358
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:19,885
conflict continues. The problem is the causative factor which is behind...

359
01:02:20,085 --> 01:02:32,378
Usually this happens to women because husbands are usually unfaithful.

360
01:02:36,443 --> 01:02:47,471
Apart from the Indians, I take them out, the percentage of the people being

361
01:02:47,671 --> 01:03:14,101
unfaithful at least once in their married life is 85%. Maybe more. I don't know.

362
01:03:14,301 --> 01:03:31,621
But this is a fact. So we are talking about a woman who is left dissatisfied at least

363
01:03:31,821 --> 01:03:51,254
and the hormonal levels are not satisfied. You know that we use Conium

364
01:03:51,454 --> 01:04:03,474
in cases of cancer and what is the main symptomatology?

365
01:04:03,674 --> 01:04:10,207
Suppression of hormones in a woman, either because of the death of the husband

366
01:04:10,407 --> 01:04:20,113
or because the husband has other affairs or because the husband has not the virility

367
01:04:20,313 --> 01:04:27,953
to satisfy the woman. So the woman remains dissatisfied with the situation and

368
01:04:28,153 --> 01:04:41,757
that is why a lot of times she develops cancer which responds to Conium.

369
01:04:41,957 --> 01:04:55,420
The response to Conium is with women who are not so much in grief because

370
01:04:55,620 --> 01:05:03,238
the husband is dead or because she has found out that the husband is unfaithful.

371
01:05:03,438 --> 01:05:18,283
The cases of Conium in women will be because of the man being impotent

372
01:05:18,483 --> 01:05:26,810
either totally or half-impotent or the loss of the husband or in any case the husband

373
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:35,055
cannot respond to the frequency of the desire of the woman.

374
01:05:37,184 --> 01:05:45,606
These are difficult situations which may end into cancer in women and Conium will

375
01:05:45,806 --> 01:05:57,571
be needed at a certain point of treatment with such women and will save her life.

376
01:05:57,771 --> 01:06:08,457
One dose of Conium may bring back the tension which is created by suppressing

377
01:06:08,657 --> 01:06:11,522
the hormones.

378
01:06:24,254 --> 01:06:29,509
-About the example that you have given before of the woman cancer... if the woman

379
01:06:29,709 --> 01:06:38,259
has conflict in her marriage, that means she has a lover but she does not take any

380
01:06:38,752 --> 01:06:45,522
decision for her marriage because her marriage is nonexistent, they live together

381
01:06:46,050 --> 01:06:52,230
but on the other hand she has her love, is it an incurable case?

382
01:06:52,430 --> 01:07:05,685
-This is the husband syndrome in which the woman due to the lack of satisfaction

383
01:07:05,885 --> 01:07:14,882
in sex, she will develop several symptomatologies.

384
01:07:15,082 --> 01:07:19,107
One of the symptomatologies she may develop is cancer either in the breast or in the

385
01:07:19,307 --> 01:07:31,353
uterus, but not always. She may develop all kinds of other pathologies but one of

386
01:07:31,553 --> 01:07:38,713
the symptoms that she can develop under such circumstances is cancer.

387
01:07:38,913 --> 01:07:55,196
If her organism is weak, it will be metastatic. You may know that cancer which is

388
01:07:55,396 --> 01:08:09,560
hormone-dependent is more curable than the other cancer. Because usually they give

389
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:19,737
hormones to the woman and take out the pressure of the hormonal development.

390
01:08:25,209 --> 01:08:36,891
-I have a question on patients under allopathic treatment.

391
01:08:37,509 --> 01:08:47,352
When the patient is for long time under allopathic treatment, then the picture becomes

392
01:08:47,552 --> 01:09:02,334
totally distorted and you might not consider anymore the previous symptoms...

393
01:09:02,534 --> 01:09:10,044
-20 years ago he cannot remember what the symptoms were before...

394
01:09:10,244 --> 01:09:17,282
He may remember some things, not the real picture. Actually if you cannot do

395
01:09:17,482 --> 01:09:23,088
anything else and you cannot stop the medication because of a danger in his life,

396
01:09:23,288 --> 01:09:36,683
then you have to act by giving a remedy which you think is good and reduce at the

397
01:09:36,883 --> 01:09:47,906
same time, if he's improving, the drugs he is taking.

398
01:09:48,106 --> 01:09:51,472
The more he is improving, the more you reduce the drugs.

399
01:09:51,672 --> 01:09:59,614
In this case you have to remember repetition of the potency is necessary.

400
01:09:59,814 --> 01:10:04,044
You have to repeat the remedy.

401
01:10:04,244 --> 01:10:13,650
-In mental cases usually they do remember quite well. In psychotic cases for example

402
01:10:13,850 --> 01:10:19,853
they can tell you what illusions and delusions they had but then they might have

403
01:10:20,053 --> 01:10:25,545
been under treatment for 5-10 years and then they come to you.

404
01:10:25,745 --> 01:10:31,306
Do you consider the original delusions?

405
01:10:31,506 --> 01:10:40,181
-No. It's very difficult in such cases. You are talking about schizophrenics.

406
01:10:40,381 --> 01:10:44,828
They have started 16-18 years with delusions, they took allopathic drugs,

407
01:10:45,028 --> 01:10:49,456
now they are 35 and they come to you and say treat them.

408
01:10:49,656 --> 01:10:58,188
Can you treat them? I have tried to treat such cases but I was not successful.

409
01:10:58,388 --> 01:11:10,477
My gut answer is no, I can do nothing. But if somebody is schizophrenic and he comes

410
01:11:10,677 --> 01:11:18,806
without much medication, then I will try to stop the medication.

411
01:11:19,006 --> 01:11:26,894
And then I will have a full picture.

412
01:11:28,639 --> 01:11:36,941
There was somebody who came here with his mother, a nice boy.

413
01:11:37,141 --> 01:11:47,372
Stop the medication. In the place he was staying they said he destroyed all

414
01:11:47,572 --> 01:12:00,650
the flowers. Broke all the glasses with the flowers.

415
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:17,386
I started treating him with a lot of success because the aggressiveness went low.

416
01:12:17,586 --> 01:12:29,428
He could start talking, he found a girlfriend. He attached himself so the mother says

417
01:12:29,628 --> 01:12:34,510
he is attaching himself to that girl. They wanted further treatment, they wanted to

418
01:12:34,710 --> 01:12:42,120
take him to a clinic and now he is back in very bad situation.

419
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:51,896
But in some cases of that type which are not really zombies, because if the

420
01:12:52,096 --> 01:13:03,178
schizophrenic comes after 35 years they are zombies, forget it we can do nothing.

421
01:13:03,726 --> 01:13:10,549
How can you take out all these drugs they have taken, the sedatives can kill

422
01:13:10,749 --> 01:13:21,844
somebody, they are dangerous for the society. In the civilized countries they detain

423
01:13:22,044 --> 01:13:34,235
all these people that they must be in the asylum, take drugs and stay as zombie.

424
01:13:37,643 --> 01:13:43,781
-I have several such cases this season.

425
01:13:43,981 --> 01:13:49,986
People who stopped their medication by themselves because they don't want to and

426
01:13:50,186 --> 01:13:52,762
they heard they could get help from me.

427
01:13:52,962 --> 01:13:58,110
I was in very big dilemmas because they will come with pathology which is

428
01:13:58,310 --> 01:14:02,907
very complex and they'll have very strong delusions and also very strong fears

429
01:14:03,107 --> 01:14:08,957
and I will be in front of picture of very strong delusions which for example

430
01:14:09,157 --> 01:14:14,629
would go with Mancinella and very strong fears that would go with Stramonium.

431
01:14:14,829 --> 01:14:19,507
I know that the rules is that you go first for mental symptoms and you look

432
01:14:19,707 --> 01:14:26,077
for delusions first and then the fears and my question is am I allowed to treat

433
01:14:26,277 --> 01:14:29,936
very often such cases?

434
01:14:30,136 --> 01:14:36,704
-In such cases you have to repeat the remedy. You search for the best remedy.

435
01:14:36,904 --> 01:14:43,460
You decided this is the remedy. Which is very difficult but you have to repeat it

436
01:14:43,660 --> 01:14:53,226
in order to see if there is an effect. By giving one dose, cases of that type

437
01:14:53,426 --> 01:15:00,090
I have seen responding only in India.

438
01:15:00,290 --> 01:15:10,621
People are strong, so if somebody goes in an acute psychotic episode

439
01:15:10,821 --> 01:15:14,224
then with one remedy he can come back. It's different.

440
01:15:14,424 --> 01:15:23,283
Here in the west if somebody starts with delusions and schizophrenia then it is going

441
01:15:23,483 --> 01:15:34,011
to be very difficult to find the remedy. Because the organisms have been undermined

442
01:15:34,211 --> 01:15:51,049
by generations of syphilis, gonorrhea etc. A mental hospital in India is totally different

443
01:15:51,249 --> 01:16:05,996
than a mental hospital in the west. In a mental hospital... what was the percentage

444
01:16:06,196 --> 01:16:09,403
that you had success?

445
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:29,523
-30% of the mental cases...

446
01:16:38,330 --> 01:16:51,348
-The remedy is clearer. The organism is not so much undermined by syphilis and

447
01:16:51,548 --> 01:16:56,941
gonorrhea. Something else I have noticed.

448
01:16:57,141 --> 01:17:21,807
Kent has spoken about syphilis that drives people to become alcoholics and also

449
01:17:22,007 --> 01:17:33,740
people are also losing their hair. If you take a picture of people of the west.

450
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:45,650
1000 people. See how many people are bald and you take 1000 people in India

451
01:17:45,850 --> 01:17:49,828
you will hardly see any person with baldness. Which means that the syphilis that

452
01:17:50,028 --> 01:18:01,532
was carried through the English occupying India, most of the English people had

453
01:18:01,732 --> 01:18:12,651
syphilis when they were down there, because of the customs and morals

454
01:18:12,851 --> 01:18:23,330
of the Indian race, they did not mix and were not infected much.

455
01:18:23,530 --> 01:18:32,625
Because their morals were very strong within the family.

456
01:18:32,825 --> 01:18:41,648
And that is how they survived to have better immune system than we have and

457
01:18:41,848 --> 01:18:47,226
clearer picture. Best for prescribing.

458
01:18:47,426 --> 01:18:58,194
-There are many cancer cases in India that we are curing with a single dose.

459
01:19:03,828 --> 01:19:06,884
-Yet you cannot cure all the cases.

460
01:19:07,084 --> 01:19:09,865
-Not all.

461
01:19:10,065 --> 01:19:18,284
-But there is a bigger percentage than here. And with one remedy.

462
01:19:18,484 --> 01:19:26,366
Because there are cases in Group 1, cancer cases which are responding.

463
01:19:26,566 --> 01:19:31,668
-I would like to share a very bitter experience of my practice and I would like

464
01:19:31,868 --> 01:19:34,542
to have your suggestion as well.

465
01:19:34,742 --> 01:19:40,633
I had a case of child of 16 years old who was having epilepsy and she was

466
01:19:40,833 --> 01:19:45,303
on strong anti-epileptic drugs. She was Silica by constitution.

467
01:19:45,503 --> 01:19:56,909
After giving a remedy she was improving beautifully...

468
01:19:57,109 --> 01:20:01,252
-Did you reduce the anti-epileptic?

469
01:20:01,452 --> 01:20:07,055
-Yes, after giving Silica I was able to find the Similimum, so I started reducing

470
01:20:07,255 --> 01:20:10,546
allopathic medicine very slowly.

471
01:20:10,746 --> 01:20:15,840
She was very cooperative, the whole family was very cooperative.

472
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:23,538
During the treatment she had to pass exams and we know Silica has a lot

473
01:20:23,738 --> 01:20:29,196
 of examination fear and after that she went into so much stress,

474
01:20:29,396 --> 01:20:35,791
that she developed strong convulsions and she expired...

475
01:20:35,991 --> 01:20:46,496
Because of exam stress she was in status epilepticus and she expired.

476
01:20:46,696 --> 01:20:54,348
It was a beautiful prescription and then there was a very bitter outcome...

477
01:20:54,548 --> 01:20:59,929
I would like to have your opinion, during the treatment when we are reducing

478
01:21:00,129 --> 01:21:24,241
the allopathic drugs, patient had stresses of life... so the exciting cause was playing

479
01:21:24,441 --> 01:21:29,810
a role during the reduction of the allopathic medicine so the patient was in

480
01:21:30,010 --> 01:21:40,041
a vulnerable state... can you suggest us something to do this in a much better way?

481
01:21:40,241 --> 01:21:48,522
-It depends on the individual case. Every case is individual.

482
01:21:48,722 --> 01:21:52,241
I cannot suggest a remedy or something like that.

483
01:21:52,441 --> 01:21:56,887
-But giving the same remedy even in higher potency doesn't work in some cases.

484
01:21:57,087 --> 01:22:01,797
Even when we evaluate the case sometimes the situation doesn't allow us to evaluate

485
01:22:01,997 --> 01:22:04,536
in a better way.

486
01:22:04,736 --> 01:22:21,568
-If you see that case is not responding, in case you have stopped the medication

487
01:22:21,768 --> 01:22:33,780
and there is a crisis and does not respond then you may resort to allopathic drugs.

488
01:22:33,980 --> 01:22:42,780
That means you cannot find at this moment the indicated remedy...

489
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:55,432
Here is Athena, she is a pediatrician and I have been treating a case exactly like yours,

490
01:22:55,632 --> 01:23:12,318
an autistic child with severe epileptic condition. The girl stopped the allopathic drugs,

491
01:23:12,518 --> 01:23:21,269
was taking only homeopathic, she was doing quite well, the parents took the child to

492
01:23:21,469 --> 01:23:28,635
the beach, this child remained under the sun quite a lot most probably and

493
01:23:28,835 --> 01:23:38,672
she started convulsions, so they brought the child here in convulsions.

494
01:23:38,872 --> 01:23:49,637
I gave a remedy, no effect. I waited 5-10 minutes I gave another remedy, no effect.

495
01:23:49,837 --> 01:23:59,868
She continued more and more severe epileptic fits, I gave a 4th remedy if I remember

496
01:24:00,068 --> 01:24:14,316
well and then I saw she was going into status epilepticus (because it was 45 minutes).

497
01:24:14,516 --> 01:24:26,198
I asked for a helicopter to take the case. So Athena being a pediatrician I asked her to

498
01:24:26,398 --> 01:24:39,048
accompany the case in the helicopter. The child was carried to the hospital in Athens.

499
01:24:39,248 --> 01:24:49,369
By the time the child arrived in the hospital, she was out of the fit.

500
01:24:49,569 --> 01:24:58,021
That means the last remedy I had given was finally the correct one, it acted but did not

501
01:24:58,221 --> 01:25:09,484
have time, so after half an hour of travelling the child recovered totally and since then

502
01:25:09,684 --> 01:25:22,689
has become normal I believe because an American homeopath who took the case

503
01:25:22,889 --> 01:25:31,457
later on said that he was treating the child with the last remedy I had prescribed here

504
01:25:31,657 --> 01:25:36,027
and the child is quite in good condition.

505
01:25:36,227 --> 01:25:45,564
A child that was autistic with epilepsy and now is not autistic and has no epilepsy but

506
01:25:45,764 --> 01:25:55,840
as I said I saw the danger and said move it to the hospital to give the sedatives.

507
01:25:56,040 --> 01:26:02,041
-That time it was at her home preparing for the examinations and because of stress

508
01:26:02,241 --> 01:26:08,133
she developed the fit and she started going into status epilepticus.

509
01:26:08,333 --> 01:26:17,527
Before her parents brought her into the allopathic hospital, she collapsed, she expired.

510
01:26:17,727 --> 01:26:24,776
I had that experience 3 years ago. I have read the chapter number 17 on how to stop

511
01:26:24,976 --> 01:26:29,114
allopathic medicines from Science of Homeopathy a book written by you.

512
01:26:29,314 --> 01:26:36,975
I have read that chapter more than 50 times because for health one must not

513
01:26:37,175 --> 01:26:39,299
experiment...

514
01:26:39,499 --> 01:26:49,298
-One thing that you have to be careful when you cut the medication, one parameter

515
01:26:49,498 --> 01:26:57,589
which you have to take care is whether the patient himself in all other respects

516
01:26:57,789 --> 01:27:07,200
is feeling better. It's not only the symptomatology that is better, he has to be better

517
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:19,907
all-around and the previous history of the child that means when it started,

518
01:27:20,107 --> 01:27:32,495
how severe were the crisis before the epilepsy...

519
01:27:36,983 --> 01:27:44,803
-Actually it was not that kind of severe epileptic fit what she was having...

520
01:27:46,781 --> 01:27:53,761
what I perceived is the withdrawal effect of the allopathic medicine coupled

521
01:27:53,961 --> 01:28:01,119
with stress has ruined her life. Otherwise she was doing beautifully well with Silica

522
01:28:01,319 --> 01:28:05,666
and I was very sure that I will be able to bring her out of the problem.

523
01:28:05,866 --> 01:28:10,684
But this unfortunate event actually caused the whole incidence.

524
01:28:10,884 --> 01:28:20,565
-Most probably the organism in a deeper level was not really... because epileptic

525
01:28:20,765 --> 01:28:27,657
fits are not every day. That means if you let an epileptic person for a period of

526
01:28:27,857 --> 01:28:34,785
6 months, he may not have anything at all. In 6 months he has an epileptic fit and

527
01:28:34,985 --> 01:28:44,011
then again after 6 months and then maybe later on every 3 months, every 1 month...

528
01:28:44,211 --> 01:28:55,793
If you observe the development of such cases you may assess the severity of epilepsy

529
01:28:55,993 --> 01:29:03,209
because what you are saying is a problem also I have seen with other homeopaths...

530
01:29:03,409 --> 01:29:15,537
A.G. one of the best prescribers he had his daughter in a state of coma from epileptic

531
01:29:15,737 --> 01:29:29,423
fits, a semi-comatose state for years. You have to be very careful understanding

532
01:29:29,623 --> 01:29:39,359
the severity of the disease by taking carefully the progress...

533
01:29:39,559 --> 01:29:49,040
An epileptic attack which starts and then the next attack is after one month and then

534
01:29:49,240 --> 01:30:01,278
the 3rd attack is after 15 days and then the next attack is after 10 days and then every

535
01:30:01,478 --> 01:30:08,860
day there is a fit, if the progress is so fast you have to be very careful in prescribing

536
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:15,384
because you may expect at a certain moment he may go into status epilepticus.

537
01:30:15,584 --> 01:30:27,674
You may say people are not going in status epilepticus. Of course they go

538
01:30:27,874 --> 01:30:32,099
under allopathic drugs and also die under allopathic drugs.

539
01:30:32,299 --> 01:30:38,692
You see one case tortured you for years because this happened but you did the best

540
01:30:38,892 --> 01:30:47,468
you could actually, you let this child live for a period of time in a good condition.

541
01:30:47,668 --> 01:30:55,692
But you have to be careful assessing the severity of disease by the progress that was

542
01:30:55,892 --> 01:31:10,757
there before and be more aware. Do not feel comfortable when there is no repetition

543
01:31:10,957 --> 01:31:23,684
of the epileptic fits... Ok, one year no epileptic fit, still you have to be aware.

544
01:31:23,884 --> 01:31:35,020
That means attend the case, see whether the other symptomatology is presenting

545
01:31:35,220 --> 01:31:50,238
another remedy, maybe you give it and a great confirmation is when you have acutes

546
01:31:50,438 --> 01:32:00,634
with high fever during that and I have seen when treating epileptic cases immediately

547
01:32:00,834 --> 01:32:07,797
after the right remedy, then high fever comes and that's a good sign.

548
01:32:07,997 --> 01:32:24,580
The case is doing quite well. The case we saw of Crohn's disease, gave correct remedy

549
01:32:24,780 --> 01:32:33,110
and fever was immediately there and that's why the child is curable.

550
01:32:37,023 --> 01:32:46,127
It's almost already cured but what is left will be cured with Carbo vegetabilis and

551
01:32:46,327 --> 01:32:50,432
then Medorrhinum. After Medorrhinum will be totally cured.
