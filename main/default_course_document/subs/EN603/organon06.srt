1
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:29,090
I never thought that this job would
be as difficult as it appears to be,

2
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,491
to tell you the truth.

3
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:47,389
The difficulty is that I
perceive certain ideas

4
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:52,289
which I have to transmit and these
ideas which I have in my mind

5
00:00:52,592 --> 00:00:57,087
have to comply with
what is written.

6
00:01:03,687 --> 00:01:10,592
There are in some
instances where I can see

7
00:01:12,087 --> 00:01:24,991
that Hahnemann either was a bit
uncertain or he was discussing things

8
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:31,887
according to his time and taking
into his mind his experiences.

9
00:01:33,087 --> 00:01:38,789
All these have to be put together
in order to be transferred to you

10
00:01:39,388 --> 00:01:48,387
and simplify the issues so it can
become easy for you to understand.

11
00:01:52,887 --> 00:01:56,492
This is not so easy.

12
00:02:04,888 --> 00:02:13,388
114. "With the exception of
these narcotic substances,

13
00:02:14,887 --> 00:02:23,887
in experiments with moderate doses of
medicine on healthy bodies, we observe..."

14
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:39,488
Here is a point where you
have to be very careful.

15
00:02:43,087 --> 00:02:52,689
"...we observe only their
primary action".

16
00:02:56,591 --> 00:03:01,689
He says with the exception of
these narcotic substances,

17
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:16,092
in experiments what will do in proving
with moderate doses on healthy individuals

18
00:03:16,987 --> 00:03:21,192
we observe only their
primary action.

19
00:03:22,991 --> 00:03:32,890
This "only" means what? First of all it means
that this is what we are interested in.

20
00:03:33,487 --> 00:03:41,290
We are interested only in this observation,
of what changes the moderate doses

21
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:46,388
have brought about on
healthy individuals.

22
00:03:47,887 --> 00:04:04,691
By saying "with the exception of these narcotics"
means that moderate doses in narcotics

23
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:15,489
is different with moderate doses with all
other medicines. What is the difference?

24
00:04:18,487 --> 00:04:23,588
Here he has actually made a mistake
which I have to point out.

25
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:35,591
He says that narcotics take out
the sensibility on the first part

26
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:41,887
and people do not
feel any bad symptoms

27
00:04:42,789 --> 00:04:50,291
because it takes out the sensation and
the sensibility, the irritability.

28
00:04:51,787 --> 00:04:59,292
Therefore in this case we
take the symptoms after,

29
00:04:59,588 --> 00:05:09,791
when the vital force reacts back after the
suppression from the first dose of narcotics.

30
00:05:11,589 --> 00:05:14,591
That is why he says
it is different.

31
00:05:16,987 --> 00:05:25,990
In narcotics we take into consideration the
symptoms which come as a secondary action

32
00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:30,487
or as an after effect action.

33
00:05:34,991 --> 00:05:39,189
This is wrong. How do
we know it is wrong?

34
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:47,588
Because the vital force reacts
from the very beginning.

35
00:05:48,487 --> 00:05:58,387
It doesn't matter that it
produces no aggressive symptoms.

36
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:02,887
It produces symptoms
which are pleasant.

37
00:06:04,689 --> 00:06:13,689
The vital force still produces symptoms
and we know that these symptoms

38
00:06:13,991 --> 00:06:22,690
that are produced by narcotics (opium)
are very useful for us in prescribing.

39
00:06:22,991 --> 00:06:34,391
So the first part, where he says don't take
note of the repercussion of the vital,

40
00:06:35,288 --> 00:06:48,191
this sedation, this feeling good of
with the opium, it is the main symptom,

41
00:06:49,092 --> 00:06:53,291
the characteristic on
which we prescribe Opium.

42
00:06:54,188 --> 00:07:02,591
We prescribe Opium in a case where there
is a terrible state and he says "I'm ok".

43
00:07:03,491 --> 00:07:10,091
You see the patient there and say it is not
possible that he will be feeling good.

44
00:07:11,887 --> 00:07:19,387
How do you feel? Nice, good!
It's impressive.

45
00:07:20,292 --> 00:07:28,990
So you can prescribe opium on
that and have fantastic results.

46
00:07:30,487 --> 00:07:34,689
Even in cases who are
progressed in pathology.

47
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:44,287
One of the main symptoms of Opium comes
from the first part of the proving.

48
00:07:45,188 --> 00:07:50,290
When Opium was given and the
person felt everything is ok.

49
00:07:55,689 --> 00:08:04,091
He did not have to make this distinction
and create a doubt in our minds

50
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:06,491
of what he wants to say.

51
00:08:10,387 --> 00:08:20,288
The proving of the Opium is
first of all this feeling good

52
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:26,592
which is not justified
by the pathology.

53
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:33,788
The pathology is such that you don't
expect that he will say he feels good.

54
00:08:34,988 --> 00:08:41,591
Don't prescribe Opium in every case
when the patient says "I feel good"!

55
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:57,788
But when you don't expect to say I feel good
then you say this may be a case of Opium.

56
00:09:30,191 --> 00:09:36,489
I think we spoke about
paragraph 115 when he says

57
00:09:37,091 --> 00:09:49,990
sometimes the same remedy has for a
period of time a set of symptoms

58
00:09:50,891 --> 00:10:00,790
and then later on there is a repercussion
and the symptoms go to the opposite side.

59
00:10:02,288 --> 00:10:09,190
The remedy can produce some
symptoms and then by reaction

60
00:10:09,488 --> 00:10:22,090
because the substance is stimulating
he may get the opposite symptoms

61
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:34,390
and such symptoms are not called
secondary but alternating.

62
00:10:37,691 --> 00:10:49,391
I would like you to tell me for paragraph
116... This is a very simple paragraph.

63
00:10:51,191 --> 00:10:53,891
I would like you to tell me
if somebody understands it.

64
00:10:55,689 --> 00:11:04,388
"Some symptoms are produced by the medicines
more frequently - that is to say,

65
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:12,491
in many individuals, others
more rarely or in few persons,

66
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:20,290
some only in very few
healthy bodies."

67
00:11:21,191 --> 00:11:24,489
Who wants to comment on this?

68
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:34,691
- I think it depends on the
sensitivity of the provers.

69
00:11:39,191 --> 00:11:42,791
The common symptoms will be
seen in most of the provers.

70
00:11:43,387 --> 00:11:49,391
The more rare and peculiar will only
develop in very sensitive provers.

71
00:11:52,989 --> 00:11:57,791
- It doesn't say that. It says something
else but what you say is correct.

72
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,990
But it is not said here
in this paragraph.

73
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:27,791
Some symptoms produced by the medicines
are more frequently manifesting.

74
00:12:37,387 --> 00:12:46,690
- If you prove in low potency...<br/>-
It's not a matter of potency.

75
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:59,591
- Those symptoms who come more often
are more important for the medicine

76
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:10,089
that we give degrees 1-4 in the
repertory for every rubric.

77
00:13:10,391 --> 00:13:13,690
One remedy is in the 1st degree which
means it has been seen very seldom

78
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,488
and one remedy in the 3rd degree

79
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:19,092
which means it has been seen
many times in the proving.

80
00:13:19,988 --> 00:13:28,987
- Yes. This is the idea.
I'll give an example.

81
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:46,387
When you do a proving some symptoms of
the drug will appear in many cases.

82
00:13:51,792 --> 00:14:02,289
Which are these symptoms? Some symptoms
which are more characteristic of the drug.

83
00:14:02,889 --> 00:14:10,689
For instance if you prove
Belladonna out of the provers

84
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:19,389
a lot of them will get a
hot face with cold feet.

85
00:14:22,088 --> 00:14:31,091
This is characteristic of the drug.
It will appear in many provers.

86
00:14:31,992 --> 00:14:39,787
But other symptoms of that drug will
appear only in very few individuals.

87
00:14:40,991 --> 00:14:49,988
Therefore if a remedy brings
many times a symptom,

88
00:14:50,887 --> 00:15:00,790
we put it on the 3rd degree in the
repertory and then we have 2nd degree.

89
00:15:02,336 --> 00:15:04,735
In the 1st degree
we have symptoms

90
00:15:05,334 --> 00:15:11,934
who have been manifested
in 1-2 out of 100 people.

91
00:15:13,435 --> 00:15:19,038
They are valid but we don't pay
so much attention to them.

92
00:15:20,235 --> 00:15:34,636
The keynote of the drug will manifest to as
many provers as possible or to many provers.

93
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:59,020
If you prove Natrum muriaticum a headache
which comes around 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.,

94
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:09,625
which is characteristic, will
appear in quite a lot individuals.

95
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:23,421
Or the increase in the desire for salt
will come to quite a few individuals.

96
00:16:25,221 --> 00:16:37,820
But some unimportant symptoms, a
pain in the left knee during sleep,

97
00:16:40,221 --> 00:16:44,122
maybe it is there,
we will record it,

98
00:16:45,021 --> 00:16:52,221
but very few individual brought
it out in the proving. Very good.

99
00:16:57,623 --> 00:17:09,320
Now he will try to explain why this
happens in the next paragraph.

100
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:15,921
"To the latter category belong
the so-called idiosyncrasies,

101
00:17:16,822 --> 00:17:30,621
by which are meant peculiar corporeal
constitutions which, although otherwise healthy,

102
00:17:31,821 --> 00:17:42,621
possess a disposition to be brought into a
more or less morbid state by certain things

103
00:17:43,223 --> 00:17:51,322
which seem to produce no impression and
no change in many other individuals."

104
00:17:52,521 --> 00:18:06,621
He says there are some constitutions which
are affected very much by certain substances

105
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:14,423
and these certain substances appear
to have no effect on all others.

106
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:36,624
He drives the student
slowly to deeper ideas.

107
00:18:40,225 --> 00:18:51,921
In this footnote he says "Some few persons
are apt to faint from the smell of roses

108
00:18:52,823 --> 00:19:01,220
and to fall into many other morbid,
and sometimes dangerous states

109
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:09,922
from partaking of mussels, crabs
or the roe of the barbell"

110
00:19:12,921 --> 00:19:15,620
I don't know what it is.

111
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:34,220
The caviar. Not the expensive one.
Eggs of the fish.

112
00:19:43,524 --> 00:19:48,021
Those who are not vegetarians
they may have tasted barbouni.

113
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:56,424
It's very tasty food. He
says certain individuals

114
00:19:56,722 --> 00:20:00,921
are affected very much by
certain things like a perfume.

115
00:20:01,823 --> 00:20:06,320
They may even faint by a perfume. This
perfume will not affect everybody

116
00:20:06,923 --> 00:20:12,921
but there is one person among us who
will faint if there is such a perfume.

117
00:20:15,921 --> 00:20:20,722
He wants to say with this
that there are idiosyncrasies

118
00:20:21,325 --> 00:20:26,724
that in these people there
is such a predisposition

119
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:33,921
for such reaction towards
a minute stimulation.

120
00:20:38,723 --> 00:20:54,020
"But this inability to make an impression
on every one is only apparent".

121
00:21:03,022 --> 00:21:21,624
What he means? Who will tell me?
Now you're stuck?

122
00:21:25,523 --> 00:21:30,321
- Does he mean this is a matter of quantity
that if someone takes a minute dose

123
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:35,724
it will not be apparent but if he
takes a bigger dose then eventually

124
00:21:36,023 --> 00:21:37,524
he will develop the symptoms?

125
00:21:41,124 --> 00:21:53,422
- He had said in paragraph 35
or 36 that medicinal substances

126
00:21:54,623 --> 00:22:03,624
have an effect upon the human
organism without exception.

127
00:22:04,522 --> 00:22:11,421
In all individuals. All individuals
can be affected by a substance

128
00:22:12,321 --> 00:22:22,520
as long as the dose is large enough.
He reminds this now here.

129
00:22:23,123 --> 00:22:28,821
He says ok a person can faint, can
have some reaction from barbouni

130
00:22:29,425 --> 00:22:41,121
and from the perfume because he is
sensitive. He may even die with penicillin.

131
00:22:48,624 --> 00:22:56,622
But do not think that all others are not
affected. They can also be affected.

132
00:22:59,024 --> 00:23:05,023
He will give the conditions under
which everyone can be affected.

133
00:23:09,223 --> 00:23:15,221
"For as two things are required
for the production of these

134
00:23:15,822 --> 00:23:21,520
as well as all other morbid
alterations in the health of man".

135
00:23:22,123 --> 00:23:24,521
There are 2 conditions
which are needed

136
00:23:25,723 --> 00:23:30,821
in order to produce an alteration
to the state of health, a proving.

137
00:23:33,222 --> 00:23:40,424
"to wit., the inherent power
of the influencing substance".

138
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:57,520
That means if the power of the substance
which is influencing the organism is strong,

139
00:23:58,125 --> 00:23:59,624
that is the one condition

140
00:24:01,721 --> 00:24:07,120
and the second condition is "the
capability of the vital force

141
00:24:07,421 --> 00:24:11,321
that animates the organism
to be influenced by it".

142
00:24:11,924 --> 00:24:14,321
The expression here
is wrong again.

143
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:24,823
What should be the correct
expression in order to understand?

144
00:24:27,224 --> 00:24:32,621
"and the capability of the vital
force [...] to be influenced"

145
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,222
It's not the capacity
of the vital force.

146
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:44,625
It is the predisposition of the organism
to be influenced by such substance.

147
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,721
Then it makes it clear.

148
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:58,121
But he says the capacity of the vital force
to be influenced it sidetracks the mind.

149
00:24:58,722 --> 00:25:02,323
Does not give
directly the meaning.

150
00:25:02,925 --> 00:25:12,222
The meaning is 2 conditions; one,
strong influence in conjunction

151
00:25:13,123 --> 00:25:23,322
in relation to an organism who has a
predisposition to be affected by this substance.

152
00:25:47,623 --> 00:26:02,324
He says further that the derangements of
the health depend on these 2 factors;

153
00:26:02,622 --> 00:26:11,624
the predisposition and also the
power of the influencing factor.

154
00:26:16,722 --> 00:26:25,720
"in which must lie the power of making the
same impressions on all human bodies,

155
00:26:26,925 --> 00:26:34,722
yet in such a manner that but a small
number of healthy constitutions

156
00:26:35,321 --> 00:26:37,424
have a tendency to
allow themselves

157
00:26:38,322 --> 00:26:44,923
to be brought into such an obvious
morbid condition by them"

158
00:26:51,225 --> 00:26:59,021
He has said in the beginning that every
substance will affect every human being.

159
00:26:59,924 --> 00:27:06,823
Here he brings another factor.
Which are the factors?

160
00:27:07,723 --> 00:27:17,321
First of all you have to have a powerful
agent and the second is the predisposition.

161
00:27:18,825 --> 00:27:30,223
That means the vital force accepting
being influenced by this substance.

162
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:49,121
- Couldn't it be that he was speaking as
well about the capacity of the vital force

163
00:27:49,421 --> 00:27:50,620
to move it all?

164
00:27:51,222 --> 00:27:58,121
When we take weak patients, their vital
force is not so much affected anymore...

165
00:28:00,523 --> 00:28:02,023
Know what I mean?<br/>- No.

166
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:25,123
- The vital force of the different
individuals is differently strong...

167
00:28:39,524 --> 00:28:45,524
I was thinking that he was speaking
about that the vital force

168
00:28:45,822 --> 00:28:48,823
of the different
individuals was different...

169
00:28:50,024 --> 00:29:01,120
- The vital force being different
means...<br/>- Some weaker and some stronger.

170
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,120
- But the vital force
itself is an energy.

171
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,322
So you cannot say the
vital force is strong.

172
00:29:11,923 --> 00:29:16,720
The organism is strong which
has a strong vital force.

173
00:29:18,222 --> 00:29:27,223
The weak organism has a weak vital force.
You have to understand it in this way.

174
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,323
Now you tell me your question.

175
00:29:36,822 --> 00:29:43,121
- In my mind he's talking
as well about some stages

176
00:29:43,421 --> 00:29:51,822
where the vital force is not reacting anymore.
Even though he might be predisposed before.

177
00:29:56,321 --> 00:30:07,722
- Give me some example of what you mean.
Are you reading German or English?

178
00:30:08,325 --> 00:30:10,722
- Now I'm having the
English version as well.

179
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:32,421
- I go back. The idea is that we have
to be practical in order to understand

180
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:40,220
otherwise if you are caught in
the long sentences of Hahnemann

181
00:30:40,524 --> 00:30:46,220
and the interjections between sentences
of another idea, then you are lost.

182
00:30:47,421 --> 00:30:51,322
You have to be simple. And
the simplest is this.

183
00:30:52,222 --> 00:31:02,121
He says do you think because not
everybody faints from the smell of roses

184
00:31:03,621 --> 00:31:08,125
that the smell of roses
cannot effect anybody? No.

185
00:31:10,224 --> 00:31:21,022
You give it to a big amount and then you
will see everybody will be affected.

186
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:30,622
He is driving to the same original
idea that he wants to apply

187
00:31:31,221 --> 00:31:34,521
but now he makes
it more specific.

188
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:50,725
He says it is not only the strength of the
influence but also the predisposition

189
00:31:51,921 --> 00:31:59,120
which manifests through
the vital force.

190
00:32:05,421 --> 00:32:12,621
He has brought in the idea
that everyone is influenced

191
00:32:13,221 --> 00:32:21,023
but still there are certain individuals
that are influenced more than others.

192
00:32:23,423 --> 00:32:30,621
He has to explain this and I think he
will explain it later on even better.

193
00:32:32,725 --> 00:32:36,323
"That these agents do
actually make this impression

194
00:32:36,924 --> 00:32:40,520
on every healthy body
is shown by this"

195
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:48,621
He makes a jump here which is
really difficult to comprehend.

196
00:32:49,521 --> 00:32:52,521
Does anybody understand this?

197
00:32:54,021 --> 00:33:00,325
"...that when employed as remedies they
render effectual homoeopathic service

198
00:33:01,222 --> 00:33:09,021
to all sick persons for morbid symptoms
similar to those they seem to be only capable

199
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:19,225
of producing in so-called idiosyncratic
individuals." Has anybody understood?

200
00:33:28,221 --> 00:33:30,621
- It turns the
argumentation around.

201
00:33:35,421 --> 00:33:43,821
Now he takes not the proving but the
application with the diseased person

202
00:33:44,121 --> 00:33:50,421
who is in resonance with this special
substance because it produces the symptoms...

203
00:33:59,421 --> 00:34:04,821
- His logic is quite difficult.

204
00:34:06,021 --> 00:34:14,720
He says I will prove to you that all
substances can affect all organisms.

205
00:34:16,825 --> 00:34:20,124
Then he says you have to
have a predisposition

206
00:34:21,622 --> 00:34:25,221
and an equally strong
influence in order to be.

207
00:34:26,725 --> 00:34:33,023
Now he wants to say all substances
can affect all individuals.

208
00:34:35,121 --> 00:34:36,621
How do you prove that?

209
00:34:38,721 --> 00:34:44,120
By the fact that when you give the correct
remedy the person is getting better.

210
00:34:44,724 --> 00:34:55,223
Every time you give the remedy the person
gets better therefore the substance

211
00:34:56,124 --> 00:35:03,620
can affect every individual
under all circumstances.

212
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:16,224
It is very difficult logic which only
Hahnemann can perceive and have.

213
00:35:21,621 --> 00:35:26,422
- I have been confused a little
bit with the 2 terms that we use;

214
00:35:27,924 --> 00:35:31,222
the context in
predisposition to disease

215
00:35:31,525 --> 00:35:35,125
for instance predisposition
to eczema, epilepsy etc.

216
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:42,622
and the use of the term predisposition
to be affected by a certain stimulus.

217
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:55,820
- A predisposition can be a sensitivity of
an organism towards a certain stimulus.

218
00:35:59,422 --> 00:36:08,421
You don't need more explanation.
There are 2 things.

219
00:36:09,024 --> 00:36:15,320
The stimulus must be strong
enough and the sensitivity

220
00:36:15,922 --> 00:36:21,020
should tally with this stimulus.

221
00:36:25,222 --> 00:36:32,122
He says that but the
student if he is studious,

222
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:36,320
and has understood so
far what he has said,

223
00:36:36,925 --> 00:36:45,320
he could say dear sir you have said
before that medicinal substances

224
00:36:45,924 --> 00:36:50,120
affect everyone under
all conditions.

225
00:36:50,724 --> 00:36:57,024
How you tell us now that you need a
sensitivity in order to be affected?

226
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:09,623
This is a contradiction in what
he had said in paragraph 35.

227
00:37:11,424 --> 00:37:18,023
There he had said that
the dose must be large.

228
00:37:18,622 --> 00:37:23,124
He has put this condition
which is quite strong.

229
00:37:25,221 --> 00:37:32,724
Here he says even the smell of
a rose can make somebody faint

230
00:37:35,421 --> 00:37:38,623
but this smell of rose
cannot affect everybody.

231
00:37:40,722 --> 00:37:50,625
But this is only apparent,
it actually can.

232
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:55,121
What are the conditions?
2 conditions.

233
00:37:58,724 --> 00:38:05,625
First, the stress must be strong and
the predisposition must be there.

234
00:38:06,821 --> 00:38:12,523
He calls it vital
force sensitivity.

235
00:38:39,987 --> 00:38:51,986
Which is the most innocent food?
The most innocent food is carrots.

236
00:38:52,886 --> 00:39:04,586
If you eat carrots is the
least stimulating substance.

237
00:39:06,384 --> 00:39:18,083
But he has said in paragraph 35 even
if you eat carrots in large doses

238
00:39:19,283 --> 00:39:25,283
you are going to have
poisoning, symptoms developing.

239
00:39:30,683 --> 00:39:40,887
One organism which is sensitive
will need 5 kg of carrots

240
00:39:41,483 --> 00:39:43,884
before he has a reaction.

241
00:39:44,788 --> 00:39:51,087
Another who is not sensitive,
he will need 20 kg of carrots.

242
00:39:54,083 --> 00:40:04,283
You squeeze carrots and drink
and you will eventually

243
00:40:05,483 --> 00:40:09,687
have a symptomatology
coming from the carrots

244
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:16,884
which are supposed to be the most
innocent food of all, as he himself says.

245
00:40:18,986 --> 00:40:34,283
So by the strength of the influencing you can
overcome the resistance of the organism.

246
00:40:35,187 --> 00:40:42,685
Even if he does not have a predisposition.
I am not sensitive to carrots at all.

247
00:40:42,987 --> 00:40:49,586
If I am sensitive to carrots I eat a
carrot and my eyes are blown, my ears...

248
00:40:54,985 --> 00:41:02,483
because I am sensitive to carrots.
But if I am not...

249
00:41:03,986 --> 00:41:08,484
There are organisms who are
going to have a reaction

250
00:41:09,083 --> 00:41:13,288
if they drink 4 glasses
of carrot juice.

251
00:41:14,488 --> 00:41:21,083
For some others it will be 20 glasses
of carrot juice before they start...

252
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:29,746
So he wants to say now that all
remedies affect all organisms.

253
00:41:31,243 --> 00:41:37,145
In his mind comes the
idea from his experience

254
00:41:37,746 --> 00:41:43,146
that when he was giving the similar
remedy that means a remedy

255
00:41:43,742 --> 00:41:50,646
to which the organism is
sensitive, there is always a cure.

256
00:41:52,746 --> 00:42:02,946
He connects the stimulating factor with
the predisposition to show you that

257
00:42:03,243 --> 00:42:06,246
since this phenomenon is
taking place every time,

258
00:42:06,546 --> 00:42:18,546
therefore the influence of a stimulating factor
is always there for all cases.

259
00:42:20,645 --> 00:42:32,645
I cannot explain more. Is it clear?
You tell me for whom is it clear?

260
00:42:41,345 --> 00:42:44,946
- Every stimulus is effective
to every individual

261
00:42:45,843 --> 00:42:51,544
if the individual produces the
appropriate symptoms, not in any case...

262
00:42:52,143 --> 00:42:59,946
- No. The symptoms that an
individual produces are not the same

263
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:03,843
as the symptoms another
individual produces.

264
00:43:04,147 --> 00:43:08,342
So we need 100
individuals to prove,

265
00:43:08,946 --> 00:43:12,246
take the different symptoms
from all these 100 people,

266
00:43:12,545 --> 00:43:15,844
put them all together
and form the M.M.

267
00:43:20,603 --> 00:43:42,507
But if the substance is strong it will give
out in many provers the same symptoms.

268
00:43:44,004 --> 00:43:54,203
So many provers will have common symptoms
but each will have different symptoms.

269
00:43:54,803 --> 00:44:02,606
If you take the 20 symptoms of each one,
some will be common, what will be common?

270
00:44:03,204 --> 00:44:09,505
What is strong element
in the substance.

271
00:44:15,204 --> 00:44:22,706
If you collect all the symptoms
then you will have an idea

272
00:44:23,605 --> 00:44:29,006
of the totality of the remedy.
Of what the remedy can do.

273
00:44:36,202 --> 00:44:45,204
118. "Every medicine exhibits
peculiar actions on the human frame,

274
00:44:45,804 --> 00:44:53,303
which are not produced in exactly the same
manner by any other medicinal substance

275
00:44:53,905 --> 00:44:55,706
of a different kind."

276
00:44:58,707 --> 00:45:15,204
That means that each remedy... The
problem they left me without tea!

277
00:45:18,506 --> 00:45:26,605
That's why I have dryness of the mouth.
Talking too much!

278
00:45:31,403 --> 00:45:36,806
Here he says something
very interesting.

279
00:45:37,406 --> 00:45:47,005
He says every medicinal substance will
create different symptoms than the others.

280
00:45:47,606 --> 00:45:52,502
No 2 substances will produce
exactly the same symptoms.

281
00:45:54,903 --> 00:46:05,706
But in the repertories we know that a
symptom can be produced by 100 remedies...

282
00:46:17,106 --> 00:46:29,576
When it comes to the peculiarity of a
substance having produced a singular symptom

283
00:46:29,878 --> 00:46:38,674
which is belonging only to this substance,
that symptom becomes very important.

284
00:46:42,276 --> 00:46:47,978
Opium produces symptom that when
somebody is in a terrible state

285
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,778
he can say I feel good.

286
00:46:52,779 --> 00:46:57,278
Another remedy which has a similar
symptoms during the fever

287
00:46:58,476 --> 00:47:03,878
when there are no symptoms and
the child feels perfectly well

288
00:47:04,476 --> 00:47:15,577
but he has fever 40 C, then the
remedy is Ferrum phosphoricum.

289
00:47:17,978 --> 00:47:26,674
High fever without symptoms, the child
is jumping around, there is no problem,

290
00:47:27,278 --> 00:47:34,774
you don't give Opium, you give Ferrum
phosphoricum because it's a different context.

291
00:47:36,874 --> 00:47:42,578
So he says no 2 remedies have
absolutely the same symptoms.

292
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:47,976
Some remedies share symptoms.

293
00:47:50,678 --> 00:48:00,877
Headache on the right or the left
temple extending to the back.

294
00:48:03,275 --> 00:48:05,076
You look the repertory.

295
00:48:08,977 --> 00:48:14,076
Headache over the left eye
which are the remedies?

296
00:48:14,976 --> 00:48:17,976
I don't remember,
Bryonia, Spigelia etc.

297
00:48:18,576 --> 00:48:24,876
But if the pain extends to the left occipital
protuberance then it becomes Bryonia.

298
00:48:35,072 --> 00:48:46,476
Medicines share common symptoms but when
it comes to very minute examination

299
00:48:47,074 --> 00:48:52,472
of the symptoms you will find
in every remedy peculiarities

300
00:48:53,076 --> 00:48:56,072
that do not exist
in other remedies.

301
00:48:58,774 --> 00:49:06,273
In my effort giving the M.M. what
I was trying was to give you

302
00:49:07,772 --> 00:49:14,076
the totality of a remedy
that has a personality.

303
00:49:14,976 --> 00:49:18,276
This personality if different
than that personality

304
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:23,374
and try to recognize
these personalities.

305
00:49:25,476 --> 00:49:28,476
By personalities I
mean disease states.

306
00:49:33,873 --> 00:49:51,877
119. "As certainly as every species of
plant differs in its external form,

307
00:49:52,177 --> 00:49:58,777
mode of life and growth, in its taste and smell
from every other species and genus of plant,

308
00:49:59,677 --> 00:50:03,272
as certainly as every mineral and
salt differs from all others,

309
00:50:03,874 --> 00:50:10,772
in its external as well as its internal
physical and chemical properties

310
00:50:11,546 --> 00:50:18,747
so certainly do they all differ
and diverge among themselves

311
00:50:19,347 --> 00:50:23,545
in their pathogenetic effects."

312
00:50:26,549 --> 00:50:33,749
In the same way the plants are
different in color, in odor,

313
00:50:34,347 --> 00:50:44,245
in appearance in the same way they are
differing when they are producing effects

314
00:50:44,845 --> 00:50:52,645
in a healthy organism. Simple.
He repeats himself quite a lot.

315
00:50:57,149 --> 00:51:03,449
"Each of these substances produces
alterations in the health of human beings

316
00:51:04,045 --> 00:51:11,245
in a peculiar, different,
yet determinate manner,

317
00:51:12,746 --> 00:51:21,150
so as to preclude the possibility
of confounding one with another".

318
00:51:22,047 --> 00:51:30,145
If you study properly, he says, the
pathogenetic effect of each remedy

319
00:51:31,049 --> 00:51:43,045
you will find out that they have peculiar,
different and yet determined symptoms.

320
00:51:46,649 --> 00:51:55,045
Symptoms which are differing from one
another so you may not confuse them.

321
00:51:57,745 --> 00:52:04,645
Paragraph 120. "Therefore medicines,
on which depend man's life and death,

322
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:15,747
disease and health, must be thoroughly and
most carefully distinguished from one another,

323
00:52:20,549 --> 00:52:27,445
and for this purpose tested by careful,
pure experiments on the healthy body

324
00:52:28,047 --> 00:52:32,846
for the purpose of ascertaining
their powers and real effects,

325
00:52:33,745 --> 00:52:41,245
in order to obtain an accurate knowledge of
them, and to enable us to avoid any mistake

326
00:52:42,449 --> 00:52:49,345
in their employment in diseases, for it
is only by correct selection of them

327
00:52:51,149 --> 00:52:59,848
that the greatest of all earthly
blessings" There is no bigger blessing

328
00:53:00,445 --> 00:53:04,949
than finding the correct remedy.
That is what he says.

329
00:53:06,448 --> 00:53:17,845
On earth this is the greatest blessing for
a human being to have found the remedy

330
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:20,545
which he needs.

331
00:53:22,649 --> 00:53:32,847
"...the health of the body and of the mind,
can be rapidly and permanently restored."

332
00:53:38,845 --> 00:53:42,450
As long as you have found
the correct remedy.

333
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:51,445
If you really learn to
handle these energies,

334
00:53:52,049 --> 00:53:58,047
what a blessing it will be for yourself
first and for the other people

335
00:53:58,345 --> 00:54:06,449
who receive this possibility
to give them back health.

336
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:18,146
There is no bigger blessing on earth
and yet you see this has been...

337
00:54:39,845 --> 00:54:45,848
You have these direction, you
are given these possibilities

338
00:54:47,348 --> 00:54:52,450
you instead of doing that
you say should I sit down

339
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:58,147
and try to find the correct remedy?
Forget it.

340
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:11,949
So what can I do? More or less this condition
is covered by 3,4,5,6,7,8,10 remedies.

341
00:55:13,445 --> 00:55:23,347
Take all of them and maybe one will
be correct and restore your health.

342
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:27,249
The problem is you
don't restore health.

343
00:55:33,845 --> 00:55:36,846
Who started doing that? The
pharmaceutical industry.

344
00:55:38,349 --> 00:55:44,348
They said we cannot sell one dose
because we will close down our factory.

345
00:55:45,249 --> 00:55:57,245
If we follow your ideas Mr.
George we'll close our factories

346
00:55:58,449 --> 00:56:12,249
and therefore we have to produce
drugs massively and specialties.

347
00:56:12,847 --> 00:56:19,445
We put 10 drugs in a bottle and
we say this is for bronchitis.

348
00:56:20,645 --> 00:56:26,042
This is for pneumonia, PMS...

349
00:56:32,342 --> 00:56:39,438
There are people who do not
have either the possibility

350
00:56:40,039 --> 00:56:50,538
or the mind or the energy or the enthusiasm
to sit down and with such meticulous,

351
00:56:52,042 --> 00:57:06,440
like Hahnemann was doing proving
very carefully, and produce proving,

352
00:57:08,838 --> 00:57:13,640
recognize this proving on the
pathology of the case and apply it

353
00:57:14,842 --> 00:57:24,439
and then see the fantastic effect.
Sometime it is unbelievable.

354
00:57:27,439 --> 00:57:31,341
One such impressive case
we saw three weeks ago

355
00:57:32,238 --> 00:57:43,640
when the lady came flooding with blood
for 2 months. She had blood transfusion.

356
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:51,140
She was taking heavy medications,
hormones, the blood would not stop.

357
00:57:52,940 --> 00:58:05,841
I gave one dose and before they reached
their countries the hemorrhage had stopped.

358
00:58:09,743 --> 00:58:17,841
You expect when there is
such a big hemorrhage

359
00:58:19,641 --> 00:58:26,841
that the arteries somewhere
have been opened quite a lot.

360
00:58:27,439 --> 00:58:37,640
How could they close just like that
with a remedy? It looks like a miracle.

361
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:48,741
But you can imagine the
gratitude of these people.

362
00:58:51,141 --> 00:58:54,741
They come back and say you
are god you saved me.

363
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:02,839
And if you believe that you are god forget
finding the remedy in the next case!

364
00:59:06,741 --> 00:59:14,839
For this I can confirm it! The moment you
believe you are becoming the greatest

365
00:59:15,741 --> 00:59:22,639
you will not be able to find the remedy
in the next case. It's very strange.

366
00:59:23,541 --> 00:59:25,941
I don't know why it
happens but it happens!

367
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:47,542
Drinking like this what is the remedy?
Arsenicum. My dressing is like Arsenicum's?

368
00:59:52,643 --> 01:00:00,441
My wife says put this out, put
something else, I am too tired,

369
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:06,140
no you have to take it out and put
this I am telling you, ok I'll put.

370
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:15,438
Every time I choose something to
put myself, every time I am wrong

371
01:00:16,942 --> 01:00:20,540
because it is the
opposite of Arsenicum.

372
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:33,740
Arsenicum has a sense of well dressing
and proper colors fitting, cleanliness,

373
01:00:35,243 --> 01:00:46,041
everything around has to be clean.
Me... Opposite. Philosopher...

374
01:00:51,440 --> 01:01:06,441
Then what is my remedy? I know my remedy, I
know my fate I will never find my remedy!

375
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:21,140
You don't believe but it is true. I have
never found the deeper remedy which I need.

376
01:01:22,339 --> 01:01:25,041
Of course I find the remedy
when I have an acute.

377
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:39,139
But as a child I had scabies and by
that time they put a yellow substance

378
01:01:40,043 --> 01:01:50,839
that was smelling very badly, it was Sulphur
most probably with some other mixtures.

379
01:01:51,741 --> 01:02:13,640
I'm talking before WWII, not WWI! I never
got it back. That means forget it...

380
01:02:17,242 --> 01:02:38,839
That's why always people say, how is
your health? There are people like her!

381
01:02:39,442 --> 01:02:47,541
I say this joke and immediately she thinks
he will be gone before the next seminar!

382
01:02:48,742 --> 01:02:51,741
Don't worry. It's ok.

383
01:02:55,943 --> 01:03:05,842
He has programmed, the time is exact,
when it arrives, nobody can do anything.

384
01:03:10,341 --> 01:03:16,638
I remember when I was in India
and one of the school teachers,

385
01:03:17,541 --> 01:03:26,840
heard that I was interested in
philosophy and spiritual people,

386
01:03:28,642 --> 01:03:43,041
he told me of a story of a man, he was a
guru, he was attended by this doctor,

387
01:03:51,443 --> 01:03:57,141
he says I go one day, his heart
was in a terrible condition,

388
01:03:58,039 --> 01:04:03,439
so I have told him not to move
around etc, then I go one day

389
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:14,841
and saw him sitting in position like the yogis,
he got up and he was going somewhere else

390
01:04:16,043 --> 01:04:21,139
and I shouted to him what are you doing?
You should not move you should stay there!

391
01:04:24,743 --> 01:04:31,342
He then said to me, well you doctor
you have done your job quite good,

392
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:43,341
you kept me until now, let me do my job now.
So I followed him to where he was going.

393
01:04:45,742 --> 01:04:55,339
He went to another spot, sat down in
the same position and left his body.

394
01:05:03,141 --> 01:05:08,842
He knew that this was the time. He said
you did your job well till that time.

395
01:05:09,439 --> 01:05:16,939
You kept my body with your remedies until
that moment. Let me do my job now.

396
01:05:17,458 --> 01:05:19,853
I know what I am doing.
Don't worry.

397
01:05:21,953 --> 01:05:26,753
He went to the spot, there was a
special spot he wanted to be.

398
01:05:27,356 --> 01:05:33,656
Indians believe that if the die
in Ganges is very auspicious.

399
01:05:34,553 --> 01:05:42,955
I will go to paradise which is not exactly
so but you don't go to the Ganges

400
01:05:44,457 --> 01:05:51,958
and forget all you have done in your life.
No, but they believe it.

401
01:05:52,856 --> 01:05:57,955
They go to a specific place. So he went
to a specific place, sat down and left.

402
01:06:01,256 --> 01:06:09,357
These phenomena are usual. All these
people have heard several such cases.

403
01:06:12,053 --> 01:06:18,657
So it is programmed. No matter I take my
remedies, keep my body as much as I can,

404
01:06:19,255 --> 01:06:28,858
when the time comes bye bye. I
hope I will be happy before I go.

405
01:06:30,056 --> 01:06:39,356
I will be happy only with one condition. Do
you know what it is? I will not tell you now.

406
01:06:43,527 --> 01:06:45,031
119.

407
01:07:00,328 --> 01:07:02,131
120.

408
01:07:09,929 --> 01:07:20,431
121. "In proving medicines to ascertain
their effects on the healthy body,

409
01:07:21,930 --> 01:07:30,628
it must be borne in mind that the strong,
heroic substances, as they are termed,

410
01:07:31,831 --> 01:07:40,832
are liable even in small doses to produce
changes in the health even of robust persons."

411
01:07:43,527 --> 01:07:48,031
He goes into more details
explaining what he had said before.

412
01:07:48,629 --> 01:07:56,428
He said that strong substances
he calls them heroic,

413
01:07:57,032 --> 01:08:07,527
a heroic substance is a substance that has
definitely an effect in all human organisms.

414
01:08:08,431 --> 01:08:16,227
Which are the substances that have an effect in
all human organisms even in small quantities?

415
01:08:19,227 --> 01:08:27,629
The poisons. All the poisons have an
influence upon the human organism.

416
01:08:28,531 --> 01:08:34,827
Even if you give a small quantity it
is going to produce a lot of symptoms

417
01:08:36,028 --> 01:08:50,129
even to the most robust people. "Those of milder
power must be given for these experiments

418
01:08:51,029 --> 01:08:54,929
in more considerable quantities"

419
01:09:14,732 --> 01:09:20,936
So as you need to prove substances
that are not so heroic,

420
01:09:21,161 --> 01:09:30,165
so powerful you have to consider the
quantity that you are going to give.

421
01:09:32,262 --> 01:09:41,863
So when the substance is not so
strong in relation to the human body

422
01:09:43,365 --> 01:09:46,662
you must increase the dose.

423
01:09:56,038 --> 01:10:02,341
In order to prove substances
which are very weak,

424
01:10:03,836 --> 01:10:13,437
which have not so much effect upon the human
organism you have to find individuals

425
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:30,236
who will be "free from disease, and who
are delicate, irritable and sensitive."

426
01:10:32,038 --> 01:10:39,536
In order to prove weak substances you
have to find sensitive individuals.

427
01:10:56,040 --> 01:11:00,836
- When you say that the provings
can only be done on people

428
01:11:01,141 --> 01:11:05,039
who are sensitive to that
particular remedy you actually mean

429
01:11:06,541 --> 01:11:11,938
this is because they are given small doses?
Because you never mentioned that part.

430
01:11:13,139 --> 01:11:23,937
- Yes. If the people do not take large
enough dose they cannot prove the remedies.

431
01:11:24,541 --> 01:11:27,540
- I don't think you ever said that.
You always said that...

432
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:42,236
- Wait a moment. Later on he will say that
you can do provings with high potency.

433
01:11:42,838 --> 01:11:49,136
Let's say beyond the Avogadro
number, without substance.

434
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:57,840
But you have to find specific individuals.
This is the original idea.

435
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:06,841
You have weak substances, find
individuals who are healthy

436
01:12:07,737 --> 01:12:16,740
but at the same time they are delicate.
They are easily reacting.

437
01:12:19,139 --> 01:12:27,239
Later on he will say you
have to find individuals

438
01:12:27,537 --> 01:12:30,540
who are sensitive towards
that particular substance

439
01:12:30,836 --> 01:12:33,836
in order to prove remedies
with high potencies.

440
01:12:35,937 --> 01:12:50,040
The whole idea of proving with high
potencies is so misused by homeopaths.

441
01:12:51,239 --> 01:12:57,840
They have no idea what they are doing.
They just come together and play around,

442
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:08,337
take a dose of 30CH or 200CH, talking
between them, then they collect symptoms...

443
01:13:11,036 --> 01:13:15,838
It's nonsense. There is
preparation that has to be done.

444
01:13:19,439 --> 01:13:22,736
There is protocol you have to follow.
He will give the protocol.

445
01:13:27,241 --> 01:13:37,439
122. "In these experiments - on which depends
the exactitude of the whole medical art,

446
01:13:47,038 --> 01:13:57,237
and the weal of all future
generations of mankind -

447
01:13:57,841 --> 01:14:06,536
no other medicines should be employed
except such as are perfectly well known,

448
01:14:07,439 --> 01:14:14,637
and of whose purity, genuineness and
energy we are thoroughly assured."

449
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:22,140
We had investigated properly, we are sure about
their properties, then we can apply them.

450
01:14:23,038 --> 01:14:30,434
123. "Each of these
medicines must be taken.."

451
01:14:31,631 --> 01:14:40,331
Listen to the precise
instructions he give.

452
01:14:40,933 --> 01:14:50,835
 "...must be taken in a perfectly simple, unadulterated form; the indigenous plants"

453
01:14:51,434 --> 01:15:09,133
The plants of Alonissos... "...in the form of freshly
expressed juice, mixed with a little alcohol

454
01:15:09,431 --> 01:15:18,433
to prevent it spoiling; exotic vegetable
substances, however, in the form of powder,

455
01:15:20,833 --> 01:15:28,830
or tincture prepared with alcohol
when they were in the fresh state".

456
01:15:30,333 --> 01:15:38,730
The exotic fruits you dry them, you crash
them and then with alcohol you prepare them

457
01:15:39,332 --> 01:15:47,431
"and afterwards mingled with a certain
proportion of water; salts and gums,

458
01:15:48,031 --> 01:15:52,830
however, should be dissolved in
water just before being taken.

459
01:15:53,733 --> 01:16:03,332
If the plant can only be procured in its dry
state, and if its powers are naturally weak,

460
01:16:03,932 --> 01:16:09,934
in that case there may be used for
the experiment an infusion of it,

461
01:16:10,530 --> 01:16:16,235
made by cutting the herb into small
pieces and pouring boiling water on it,

462
01:16:16,830 --> 01:16:19,971
so as to extract its
medicinal parts..."

463
01:16:21,168 --> 01:16:25,067
You see how precise information he gives.
Everybody understands.

464
01:16:25,669 --> 01:16:33,167
"...immediately after its preparation it
must be swallowed while still warm"

465
01:16:37,067 --> 01:16:49,669
The weak plants. You put
them in boiling water

466
01:16:51,166 --> 01:16:56,570
to extract the medicinal qualities
and drink it warm still.

467
01:16:58,968 --> 01:17:04,968
"...as all expressed vegetable juices
and all aqueous infusions of herbs,

468
01:17:05,570 --> 01:17:11,866
without the addition of spirit, pass rapidly
into fermentation and decomposition..."

469
01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:17,566
So you have to maintain them
with a little bit of alcohol.

470
01:17:18,168 --> 01:17:22,368
"...whereby all their medicinal
properties are lost."

471
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:25,670
124 will be the last paragraph.

472
01:17:26,866 --> 01:17:34,669
"For these experiments every medicinal
substance must be employed quite alone

473
01:17:35,867 --> 01:17:42,166
and perfectly pure, without the
admixture of any foreign substance,

474
01:17:43,368 --> 01:17:49,368
and without taking anything else of
a medicinal nature the same day,

475
01:17:49,668 --> 01:17:52,066
nor yet on the subsequent days,

476
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:57,166
nor during all the time we wish to
observe the effects of the medicine".

477
01:17:58,068 --> 01:18:06,768
So you have to take the substance very
pure without any mixture of anything else

478
01:18:07,967 --> 01:18:10,566
and you have to take
only that substance

479
01:18:11,766 --> 01:18:20,767
and never take another medicinal substance
during the whole time the experiment lasts.

480
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:34,866
Dmitri these are instruction
you should follow.

481
01:18:35,471 --> 01:18:43,866
You will see how difficult it is to
make a real homeopathic proving.

482
01:18:46,267 --> 01:18:55,866
All these fanfare of
doing new provings...

483
01:19:01,566 --> 01:19:07,867
In order to make one proving
you need one year of your life

484
01:19:11,167 --> 01:19:13,870
and here they produce
proving after proving.

485
01:19:14,771 --> 01:19:21,671
They write books.
And people believe.

486
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:29,968
He says I gave this remedy and the
person was cured. It was not cured!

487
01:19:30,570 --> 01:19:33,871
It was a placebo
effect at the best!

488
01:19:37,766 --> 01:19:44,070
The worst is that the person has
left the doctor and says goodbye.

489
01:19:46,467 --> 01:19:55,170
In England the moment there was a
little bit of an attack by the press

490
01:19:56,669 --> 01:20:07,768
half of homeopaths lost all their jobs
because their clientele left them

491
01:20:08,669 --> 01:20:16,467
as they heard that perhaps
these people are bluffing you,

492
01:20:17,366 --> 01:20:26,966
not giving you anything but sugar. They
try to do here in Greece, it didn't work.

493
01:20:28,766 --> 01:20:34,467
They also try to do it in India also.
They attack. It didn't work.

494
01:20:35,071 --> 01:20:54,267
Because in India there is a
tradition, they have 186 colleges...

495
01:21:02,070 --> 01:21:05,068
They are medical doctors,
six years of studies.

496
01:21:06,566 --> 01:21:10,470
By the time I was there the
homeopathic college was 3 years.

497
01:21:11,370 --> 01:21:19,166
It was easy to pass. That's
why I have a diploma...!

498
01:21:27,871 --> 01:21:35,068
I went to many colleges I never cared for
a diploma. The diploma means nothing.

499
01:21:35,666 --> 01:21:42,566
The diploma must be here. If the diploma
is inside the brain then you cure...

500
01:21:44,068 --> 01:21:59,669
If you have a paper and
here is empty... I am joking.

501
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:12,871
These things are really difficult. I appreciate
all this patience attending this turmoil.

502
01:22:14,670 --> 01:22:24,268
Every person that I ever encounter in my life
from the beginning, especially the Germans,

503
01:22:24,871 --> 01:22:29,970
have you read the Organon? No, I
try to read it, but I could not.

504
01:22:35,071 --> 01:22:39,570
From time to time I meet somebody
who says yes, I have read it.

505
01:22:43,770 --> 01:22:54,871
Very seldom to go through completely. To
understand completely is another story.

506
01:22:59,368 --> 01:23:05,370
That's why I am thankful to you
because I had announced 30 years ago

507
01:23:06,569 --> 01:23:08,969
I would write comments
on the Organon

508
01:23:10,168 --> 01:23:16,971
but I would never have done it unless
I have thought maybe some people

509
01:23:17,570 --> 01:23:20,268
will be interested,
so they will come,

510
01:23:20,569 --> 01:23:25,670
so I will enjoy talking with them and
then I can do it. Otherwise forget it.

511
01:23:26,267 --> 01:23:36,167
It's too dreary to sit down and write.
So you are participating in a project

512
01:23:36,466 --> 01:23:41,868
which I always had in my mind and God
said ok, I'll bring the situation.
