1
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,860
-Feedback.

2
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,930
-You wanted me to tell you what happened after the Sulphur?

3
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,650
-Yes.

4
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:39,800
-After the Sulphur I had this pain and you gave me the Latrodectus Mactans.

5
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:47,140
Actually after the Sulphur the same evening I felt euphoria, I felt good and I had loquacity.

6
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:54,640
I didn't stop, Alexander she had to suffer because I was talking to her and next day

7
00:00:54,740 --> 00:01:01,270
I still was in a good mood and only at 10 o'clock the pain started and went worse and worse.

8
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:08,290
Then in the evening you gave me the Latrodectus Mactans which gave me a hot flash in the face

9
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:12,150
immediately and the pain started going down.

10
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:20,630
Then it started with taking ECG and the blood pressure

11
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:28,470
and suddenly everybody put me in the corner of the sick people and I did not like that.

12
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:37,240
-You did not like it? Everybody knows that also. Tell us what happened after you left.

13
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:42,810
-Mentally was very bad. I was very cross.

14
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,060
-Especially with certain people?

15
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:58,090
-No, because everybody looked at me like this. I didn't like to be, the main thing that I have to know.

16
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,010
-To be in control.

17
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,660
-It's not so much in control but to know what is going on.

18
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,250
In the minute that I have the knowledge I can cope. If I don't have the knowledge, forget it,

19
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:14,680
 I go nuts, I just go crazy. It's not in this incident. It happens all the time.

20
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:20,550
-Next time we will tell you exactly and see whether you can cope.

21
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,180
-I can cope with it, I'm not worried but the thing is that I have the feeling that, because

22
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,040
you've been hiding I thought it was worse than it was actually.

23
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:41,160
When I went home I still felt very sick. I was very tired, I had pain in my hands,

24
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:51,790
 I couldn't breathe, every word I said took a lot of energy. A little word was coming like

25
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:58,790
I was losing energy and breath. It was very funny, I never had something like this in my life.

26
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:05,060
Every word I wanted to say by the time I finished the word, it was here.

27
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:14,810
 The same was with the anger. The anger came like this up to my ears. A lot of anger.

28
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,400
-Did you go for a check up?
-Yes I did.

29
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,450
-How many days after you returned?

30
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:31,130
-I returned I did a blood test, that was the quickest way I could do and I asked for a check up

31
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:39,630
by a specialist, a cardiologist. It took time, I had two big fights to get it so I went after a week

32
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:47,300
and then the check up was again later. By the beginning of July I finished all the checks ups

33
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:54,980
which was a normal ECG again by a doctor, a heart echo and ergometrics.

34
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,570
Everything was fine.
-Do you have it?

35
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:07,940
-I have it, I have it here. Now when she told me everything is fine with you, first with the

36
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,830
echo everything is fine, a big stone came out, I felt better mentally.

37
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:23,660
Then in the ergometrics. when she said it's fine then I was so happy, I was really free.

38
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:31,000
I felt like a sick person and I don't like to feel that way. I had enough in my life. I don't want.

39
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:39,250
I want to be able to do everything, I can't feel sick. The worse point was my memory which is still now.

40
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:51,070
It is diminished, it's gone. I forget my bag and I have very big fear of robbers,

41
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:59,610
 so it's very funny that I leave my bag with my money everywhere; I just forget it

42
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:07,860
and even to the ergometrics I came in another date. I had to convince them to do it.

43
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:14,770
-But what exactly happens? You forget appointments?

44
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,400
-Everything.

45
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,970
-No, wait a moment. You forget words while you are speaking?

46
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:30,770
-That I had before also. I want to say a word and I say this, I don't get the word.

47
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:43,810
I had that also the last year. My husband laughs at me. It takes time till I get the word.

48
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,040
Sometimes it takes the whole day till the next day.

49
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:55,640
-Do you forget by going from one room to the other what you have to do?

50
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:01,860
-Of course. All my follow up I lost. I did a beautiful follow up and I don't know where I put it.

51
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:09,070
I had to recall now from little pieces of papers that I found at home but everything with the doctors'

52
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:14,320
echo I put in an envelop, I put it in a place where I could find it

53
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:18,970
and it took me 2 weeks and I couldn't find it and I had to go and take extra papers

54
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:24,240
from the clinics from the computer, the blood test and everything 2 days before I came.

55
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,390
-The enzymes, everything in your blood examination was perfect also?

56
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:40,610
-Triglycerides very high which I never had high before, 6 months before I never had it.

57
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:54,420
Cholesterol is on the top like 148 and she looked at it and I said, it's not good

58
00:06:54,520 --> 00:07:00,400
and she said don't worry you make a diet, everything will be fine, your blood pressure will be fine

59
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:08,110
all this will go out and I showed the ECG that we had here, she said it's nothing,

60
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:13,340
it comes when you have a high blood pressure. It's normal. That's what she told me.

61
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,830
I said thank you and I went, for me it was enough. I was happy.

62
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,900
-But I told you about the diet myself. I told you, you have to follow.

63
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:32,300
-Yes I know. I stopped cigarettes which is very hard, I never took any cigarettes since then

64
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:43,050
to my mouth. My family is sending thanks finally. Finally I stopped smoking.

65
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:50,210
I promised you then and I didn't start. It was hard enough and making a diet I felt so bad

66
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:58,040
the last months that I couldn't think of having a diet. I need strict diet. I tried with meat

67
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:04,710
I ate more bread because everything else gave me problem to my stomach.

68
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,710
-Fish also you can eat.

69
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:16,070
-I ate fish in the grill. I hardly ate any fish and I felt sick, the fish smell I didn't like it and

70
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:23,390
the meat was too heavy for me. Since I took the Sulphur my stomach is... I have to tell you

71
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:32,520
something. I don't know if it is the Sulphur or the Latrodectus but it seems like it cleaned everything

72
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:39,140
good that any remedy did. It just stripped me from all the remedies that I had before and

73
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,070
brought me back to 5 years ago with all the problems.

74
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:53,850
I'm talking about stomach problems, cramps, everything, especially the stomach

75
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:58,370
and the memory. I never had something like this before.

76
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:06,870
-Not so strong.
-The memory is impossible. I'm angry.

77
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:14,190
-You checked in your arteries by a specialist, looking at your arteries through the eyes?

78
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:21,760
-No. If you give me a list I'll fight for it but if I don't know what to do

79
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,990
I can't go to my doctor and push her.

80
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:32,240
 If I'll push her she'll give me papers but normally they don't suggest nothing.

81
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:44,270
-It is important to know the degree of the sclerosis of the arteries.

82
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:49,070
Normally there is a degree of sclerosis.
-Through the eye?

83
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:58,320
-Through the eye the eye specialist can dilate the pupil and can look to the condition of the arteries.

84
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:02,480
So because you are a little bit over weight

85
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:07,450
and because you have been eating very well all your life...

86
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:15,390
-No, since I studied Homeopathy, in 6 years I put 30 kilos.

87
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:31,190
-We try to prevent, it's not nice for you to say everything is all right. You are not the type

88
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:38,620
because you just go alone, you just forget about it, smoking, eating...

89
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:44,520
The moment we are absolutely sure that everything is OK, you will start smoking, I promise you.

90
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:51,860
-No, I'm not. I told you I'm not stating to smoke. I had cigarettes in my bag all this time.

91
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:57,820
Only I had and on purpose I left it. I'm not smoking

92
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,170
because I don't want to smoke not because I don't have.

93
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:14,040
-Except of the memory you are doing like this, like Ignatia.

94
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:19,260
-I don't have air.
-You feel you need air.

95
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:27,360
-Since I stopped smoking my capacity of the lung maybe grew, I don't know I need air.

96
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:36,010
-You said you need air blowing in your face actually.

97
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:43,430
-Look at me now, I'm sweating all the time, my old grand mother used to.

98
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:50,250
 If the air is blowing a little bit, then it's fine.

99
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:59,280
 But even if it's not so hot outside but if the air doesn't move I feel horrible, I don't have air.

100
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:10,520
 At home I use and I sleep with an air conditioner and two fans, with a full air conditioner.

101
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,610
-You are very hot.

102
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:22,150
-Since May. Before I was hot also but not to this degree. It's getting worse and worse every day.

103
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:27,070
-I can see that. Bread and butter you are eating a lot?

104
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:34,940
-I try not to. Here in Alonissos yes because there is plenty for breakfast.

105
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:42,070
I eat in the morning but I try not to.

106
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:45,990
-Eggs?
-Eggs I like them also but I don't eat.

107
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:52,090
-Soft?
-I like them soft, mixed, scrambled.

108
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,320
-What about crying, weeping?

109
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:01,400
-All the time. That is the worse thing that happened to me since I was here.

110
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:09,660
 Again a sensitivity came, like it cleaned the Phos away. With the Phos I had a shield,

111
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:15,820
I didn't take it in and in the minute you gave me this... I was crying here all the time,

112
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:22,160
for every little word, every little look, I cried. It's terrible, it's embarrassing,

113
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:30,900
it's horrible and if somebody comes to me and tells oh this and that, how do you feel? It comes out.

114
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:38,020
It's terrible, it's not nice and I cried from anger most of the time,

115
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:51,620
if I'm angry and frustrated, if I'm angry about something immediately the tears come.

116
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,480
It's like frustration, I don't knowI cant' explain it.

117
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:07,880
I tried to write symptoms which are very obvious this time, not messy. The mouth, the dryness

118
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:16,270
I used to have before at night, now I have all day long. The burning, I have very strong burning

119
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:24,760
from here up to my ears. It's so strong that it comes up to my ears.

120
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,290
-When the pain is coming?

121
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:39,260
-All the time, anytime. At night I involuntarily vomit bile, I found myself wake up for choking

122
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:47,710
and the head up with bile, very burning from the stomach that comes up like burning

123
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:53,540
the whole esophagus. I used to have it before that time that I told you that I took Nux vomica

124
00:14:53,640 --> 00:15:01,910
and it went away? Now I have again but burning sensation is with very strong pain.

125
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:05,210
-Tell me in the past you have taken Pulsatilla?

126
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:08,960
-No, you told me to take if the Phosphorus doesn't work.

127
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,880
-No, before me.

128
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:20,320
-Never. My daughter took now Pulsatilla. I never took Pulsatilla.

129
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:31,290
The feet is numbness and sometimes ticklish and a lot of cramps.

130
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:34,300
-Cramps in the toes or in the sole?

131
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:42,510
-The sole becomes like a cramp and the toes stand. The cramp comes here and then

132
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:48,980
 it turns the whole sole and I have to stand or something and it comes if I sit like this.

133
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:59,880
There was a very funny thing which is special, I never had it before. I was sitting on the floor

134
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:11,350
trying to reach something and I felt that my intestines inside made a loop like this.

135
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:18,430
That's very funny, I never had this before. It happened a few time for about a week all the time.

136
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:33,430
This one I told you. The memory is... I have to do things at work

137
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:36,020
and if I just distract to do something else I forgot

138
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:41,620
and I skip and I'm talking about very important things that can cost me my office.

139
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:51,520
Suddenly after 2 days I remember that I didn't send a letter here or there to solve things.

140
00:16:51,620 --> 00:17:00,440
And I found out that everything that I get angry or offended, everything goes

141
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:09,020
immediately to the physical. I get upset and immediately something wrong,

142
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:14,860
the blood pressure goes high, I get hot. I had an incident before I came here.

143
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:19,110
 My husband left the country with my daughter.

144
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:22,520
-While you are here did you check your blood pressure?

145
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:42,600
-Yes, on the one hand it 200 over 120 and on the left hand was 180 over 110. And I think

146
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:55,620
now it's even more, I feel it. Every movement, every exertion makes me sweat.

147
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:16,320
This one, do you know what is that? Since I have the high blood pressure I have this swelling here

148
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:28,030
and I have also sometimes if I lie on my back, I have cramp in the back.

149
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,130
-Only on the right side?

150
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:40,810
-It's closer to the spine but on the right side, a little bit higher than the waist.

151
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:46,920
And I always have to turn immediately, otherwise the whole back is in a cramp.

152
00:18:51,680 --> 00:19:01,050
 Most terrible was the stomach problems.
-What you described.

153
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:09,500
-No, I didn't describe you yet. Since I took the Sulphur I used to wake up at 5.30 to the toilet,

154
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:16,420
7.30 to the toilet. If I woke up not with an urge to run to the toilet, after 2 minutes

155
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:28,770
I run to the toilet and gas and diarrhea and urine, everything like a war. It was terrible.

156
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,700
-In the morning?

157
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:44,690
-In the morning and it took me at least 5 times until I go to work within an hour. It was not formed.

158
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:48,010
-When it was that?

159
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:55,590
-All the last 4 months. Some days during the day too. When I came here, only the last 3 days

160
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:56,890
the stool is formed.

161
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:06,750
-Let me understand. You wake up in the morning, early in the morning from a pain in the

162
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:12,180
abdomen, an urge and then you go and you have diarrhea ...

163
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:19,920
-Gas, urine, everything it goes out and it takes at least 5 times until I finish.

164
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,590
-This happens 5 times.

165
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:31,390
-At least 5 times, I used to run. I told myself stop it, don't think about it, its' the Sulphur.

166
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:37,220
Forget it because I was afraid I'm getting my ulcerative colitis again, it's not funny.

167
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,900
Because it was with pain.

168
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:46,050
-When you had the ulcerative colitis was very severe?

169
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:52,800
-Very very severe. This kid is healthy next to what I was. You said 20 times?

170
00:20:52,900 --> 00:21:01,310
 I used to do 60 buckets of blood the day. Blood here, blood in the hospital for a few months.

171
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:09,890
42 kilos less than half of I'm now, with 5 hemoglobin. Very very sick.

172
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:18,720
 I'm very happy to see that she is more out because that helped me, just open her mouth and say.

173
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:28,720
 Don't hold in but I was afraid that I get it but it's 30 years now, I don't think I should get it.

174
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:35,800
When I had this pain in my stomach I was afraid that something was going on,

175
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:40,350
I had cancer in my colon or something because all the time they are sending me

176
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:47,710
letters to come and check. I never checked it I don't want to put nothing in.

177
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,510
But the last 3 days here it's OK.

178
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:03,510
-Where did you attribute that fact? Did you change your diet drastically?

179
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:08,680
-No, I thought it was aggravation from the remedy.

180
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:13,920
-And it stopped, you feel that it stopped the aggravation?

181
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:21,680
-I don't know. It stopped 3 days ago. Now I'm going twice, 3 times the day but not that's horrible feeling.

182
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:26,680
-I'm afraid it's not the aggravation, it's something more than the aggravation.

183
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:31,270
-Maybe it's proving, I don't know. I had the same thing when I took Sulphur last time

184
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:33,540
that's why I was afraid to take it.

185
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:38,050
-It's not a proving. It's the colitis which is coming back.

186
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:42,960
-No it's not.
-Not exactly.

187
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:49,540
-I had these years but for a very short time.

188
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:55,370
It seems upset with everything I put in my mouth, it wants to go out again very quick.

189
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:59,040
-But you say this happens only in the morning.

190
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:07,580
-No, during the day also, all day. It started in the morning and then few times during the day.

191
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,750
-Every day?

192
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:22,240
-Yes but then it continued when I went in the last week of August we went to Italy.

193
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:27,820
One day before we went to Italy I think I had a virus or something because I had a pain here

194
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,910
which I never have, a pain in the pit of the stomach here.

195
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:41,820
 Very severe pain and weakness all over, I think it was some kind of a virus,

196
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,850
I couldn't pack, I couldn't do nothing, it was terrible.

197
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:47,910
-You took some medicine?

198
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:53,070
-I didn't take anything and then when I was in Italy my husband and my daughter said

199
00:23:53,170 --> 00:24:00,660
that something is wrong with you. The smell was terrible. Everything I ate I had to run to the toilet.

200
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:07,790
It was impossible for them because I had to be near toilets all the time.

201
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:20,450
I had to find restaurants all the time, put them to sit so I can go to the toilet. It was terrible.

202
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:25,940
-The diarrhea makes you get up from bed or after you get up?

203
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:32,690
-Sometimes at the beginning it made me get up. I wrote it down and most of the days

204
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:41,290
was that I woke with it, 5.30, 6.30, 7.30 and then it calmed down and only after I woke up.

205
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:50,300
At the beginning most of the time was waking me up and then it evens up and then it

206
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:57,420
started also whenever I ate something but I always have been very sensitive in the

207
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:03,580
stomach. If I go and eat in a restaurant and something is not completely fresh within 15

208
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:09,590
minutes that goes in I have a terrible pain.
-Where?

209
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:17,080
-In my stomach and I have to run, within half an hour if I eat something rotten or little bit

210
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:20,680
old, it doesn't do anything to anybody, it does to me.

211
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:43,460
-The stool comes out with gas, like an explosion?
-Yes like an explosion till 3 days ago.

212
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:50,030
-Now it's more formed and once or twice?

213
00:25:50,130 --> 00:26:02,610
-No also twice in the morning, one day I didn't have at all in the morning and then once

214
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:09,540
in the evening or twice, but that's normal for me to have 3 the day.

215
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:21,870
I never had any constipation in my life but I'm bloated.

216
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:30,870
-You have a lot of gas.

217
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:45,940
-And now I started also swollen in the ankles which I lost after Phosphorus,

218
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:57,690
I didn't have it anymore and I wanted to tell you, I heard that everybody saying about the ticklish

219
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:05,690
of the soles, I never thought it was important to say. The most ticklish and sensitive place

220
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:12,250
in my body is my soles, I never ever walk without shoes, even not in the house.

221
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,760
-You had Medorrhinum before?

222
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:37,740
-But now it's a bit numbed the last year. Water that comes on my face when I shower

223
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,390
and I have water I look for air.
-You can not breathe.

224
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:46,790
-Yes and the same in the dentist, when I have to go the dentist I don't go

225
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:50,890
because I just drown there, he uses water.

226
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:12,450
-The stool has a peculiar color like green or brown, yellow?

227
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:21,950
-Sometimes it's yellow if I eat a lot, when I'm on diet and I eat a lot of cheese is yellow like baby.

228
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:35,540
It depends what I eat but normally is not black and when I have diarrhea you see all the food in.

229
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:56,470
The blood pressure was funny after the Sulphur.

230
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:05,890
In the end of May I found myself in the afternoon very dizzy like losing conscious

231
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:14,280
and I checked the blood pressure and then I found out that it's dropping to 17 in the afternoon.

232
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:20,470
I used to wake up with a very high blood pressure and by noon, afternoon it used to drop to 7.

233
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:38,240
120 over 70.Then starting go up again and I never used to this low one and I walked like this,

234
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:43,160
so I checked it morning, noon, I checked it for a few days to see when it's going up

235
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,850
and when it's going down, it's a cycle.

236
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:06,000
Here I wrote down strong stomachache with diarrhea, it used to wake me up in the morning

237
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:11,750
and it was like undigested food.

238
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,860
-How you wake up in the morning?
-Tired.

239
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,570
-Very tired?

240
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:46,590
-I feel like having another hour, especially here, I need the hours in the morning to rest.

241
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:51,590
-Do you have times where you feel better or worse?

242
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:56,380
-I think I feel better at night.

243
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,790
-After sunset?
-It could be.

244
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:04,290
-But not clear.

245
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:10,970
-I remember once that I was sick and it was in the afternoon...

246
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:28,180
-Desire for fresh air put 3 times.
-Not only fresh, fanning air, that will move not stand.

247
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:16,320
-The main important thing was this burning that was unbearable and the heat and the stomach,

248
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:37,630
now the stomach is OK. I had burns, I had also little ones that grow.

249
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:44,490
You see here, this grows here and around the bra.

250
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:50,150
-Little warts, they just came out?

251
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:57,300
-They came out after May, I had few before but more or them came and I had one

252
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:03,400
which was very big that I got few years ago and this one shrinked here.

253
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:22,980
The things that I got rid of which amel. this burning is the soda water, that what I'm living on now.

254
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:32,230
Soda and lemon and everything I put lemon, it's refreshing.

255
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:35,150
-You feel that you need lemon?

256
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:41,720
-Yes because I can't drink water, it's bitter, I hate water so I drink soda.

257
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,980
-You don't like water?

258
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:53,660
-Never, I never liked and cold I don't drink at all because I have pain here from the cold

259
00:33:53,760 --> 00:34:05,480
and also from ice cream. I wait to melt. There is a pain that goes up here between the eyes.

260
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:09,860
Also in the cold weather I have this.

261
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:19,540
-Put headache from cold or ice cream.

262
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:25,370
-Also if I'm in Europe in the winter I have a problem because I have a pain here.

263
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:31,810
And if I'm going on snow I have pain in my legs.

264
00:34:56,990 --> 00:35:03,910
I have something very unique with this sweat. For instance in Israel or here I found out

265
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:12,380
that if I go and the street is very hot, I go outside and I'm hot and I sweat a little bit

266
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:18,630
but in the minute that I go into a shop which is air conditioned and which is nice and cool

267
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:25,500
then I start sweating like a shower. Suddenly it comes down piles of water,

268
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:35,380
especially from the head, the forehead, leg. It's very funny because I don't sweat that much

269
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:46,970
 in the heat as I sweat when I get into a cooler place. Normally it used to be ameliorate the sweat,

270
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:56,660
now it makes it worse. Sometimes if it's really hot I sweat here.

271
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,900
-In the inguinal region.

272
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:12,230
-And sometimes it smells like semen,  a sperm, I had it the first time when I was pregnant

273
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:19,480
with my first daughter 20 years ago. I was walking in the street and suddenly I was so wet

274
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:25,790
and I thought that the water came out because it smelled funny and since then now and

275
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:28,380
then in the summer I have it.

276
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:39,070
-Your thirst is normal or less than normal?

277
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:45,790
-I'm not thirsty, I never was thirsty. I hardly drink, my daughter pushes 2 glasses per

278
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:51,030
day for me. If you let me drink as I want it would be 1 glass or 2 the day

279
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:59,810
but I'm very dry now, maybe the blood sugar went up.

280
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:07,140
-Enough information.

281
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:50,550
What shall we do?
Wait, repeat, give another remedy?

282
00:37:50,650 --> 00:38:00,170
-Yes.
-You are getting too good.

283
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:23,030
Why? There are changes and these changes point to a remedy and the remedy is clear

284
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:34,020
you can say it is quite clear because there are a lot of symptoms supporting that remedy.

285
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:49,530
Everybody is thinking of the same remedy? You don't know.

286
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:56,260
She was sighing a lot, shall we give Ignatia?

287
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,210
-No.

288
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:01,440
-You are getting good I told you.

289
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:34,620
It was very nice what she said, everything good has happened to me,

290
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:40,930
it was taking out she was left with the bad things. It's very nice to hear.

291
00:39:46,930 --> 00:40:03,750
You give a remedy, everything is going to pieces. She is not in good condition

292
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:16,060
and she likes to be more happy. The bloodpressure is very strange also, up and down, what is this?

293
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,460
-Something new, "Sulphatilla".

294
00:40:48,640 --> 00:41:03,390
-Very good, why Sulphatilla? Why? On this particular symptom of going up and down?

295
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:06,390
-Changing symptoms.

296
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:18,670
-Yes, it's very strange. Especially in blood pressure. We know moods are changing,

297
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:23,810
you are up and down, the color of menses maybe changing but to change the blood pressure

298
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:27,830
from so high to so low is the first time I hear it.

299
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:30,570
-Every day.

300
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:41,580
-So the whole class seems to me that agrees on a remedy...

301
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:52,380
Let the cardiologist speak and I have to put some questions to you.

302
00:41:53,710 --> 00:42:01,330
-I have to say that the examinations which have been made in Israel, I have to evaluate as to be not complete.

303
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:07,060
The examination of just the cholesterol without examining what is

304
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:13,150
the high cholesterol and the low cholesterol, this doctor can't really call himself

305
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:21,900
to be a good cardiologist. I've looked at the ergometric examination, she practically

306
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:30,900
broke down after 3 minutes in 25 seconds. That means they gave a too high exertion

307
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:38,500
from the very beginning on, the heartbeat without any exertion was 76 per minute.

308
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:51,750
 At the end of this test was 168. That means that the volume per minute was going up very much

309
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:56,260
and the blood pressure stayed 160 over 70.

310
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:05,770
This is either wrong or pathological or it is not taken in the correct way.

311
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:16,020
She has 8 ventricular extra systoles per minute without any comment of which kind they were.

312
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:21,920
We can't really take such an examination into consideration nor we have really

313
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:28,170
examined the back of her eye bulb, as you have already mentioned, no examination of the kidney,

314
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:30,140
 no examinations of the blood sugar, nothing.

315
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:51,680
-It started at around 23rd of May. In the morning I used to wake up with 16 over 11 or 16 over 9

316
00:43:51,780 --> 00:44:01,930
and then by the afternoon it used to go to 12-7 or 10-8 but it took about 2 weeks

317
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:07,650
and it was all up again. For 2 weeks it was like this.

318
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:12,280
-When it was up, it stayed up all the time?

319
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:24,760
-You are talking about afterwards? It stayed up around the top when it used to be between 15 and 13

320
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:38,870
and the low one used to the lowest 9, between 11 and 9 but not that low as 7 or 8.

321
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:46,970
-I want to ask you what is your opinion concerning this swelling she says

322
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:53,570
that she has developed here on the sternum.

323
00:44:54,820 --> 00:45:00,150
-We only see such a symptom with the emphysema. I've spoken to her because she came up to me

324
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:14,630
and asked about this. He has a history of bronchial asthma and if you do an auscultation of the lung,

325
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:16,980
you can't really call it emphysema.

326
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:23,750
I really you should make a thorough pulmonological examination to make a clear statement.

327
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:32,720
-Do you have any coughing while lying in bed in the evening?

328
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:35,240
-No.

329
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:47,090
-Anyhow we agree on the remedy, the remedy at this moment is quite clear. It is

330
00:45:47,190 --> 00:46:10,080
Pulsatilla. The problem is with the potency. 10M, 50M, 200, 30, 12.

331
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:26,600
What potency you will give to her? Who will give 50M? None. 10M? One.

332
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:49,680
1M? One. 200? 33. 30? 28. 12? 13.

333
00:46:55,150 --> 00:47:09,290
I will also prefer to go slowly and to start with 12C and she can take twice the day 12C

334
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:22,500
until she has a reaction. You have a reaction, then you stop and then will go slowly higher accordingly.

335
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:27,970
If you are better, you repeat 12, no good, then you go 13, 14,15 and

336
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:44,710
every 10 days you can raise one potency. But sometimes what happens in this schema

337
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:53,260
sometimes the patient will tell you the number 15 is very good, so you don't keep it 10 days,

338
00:47:53,360 --> 00:48:04,210
you continue to keep it for 1-2 months. As long as the patient feels good, you keep it to this potency.

339
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:14,250
There is a potency is which they respond much more satisfactorily and you leave it there

340
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:19,200
-But if I get aggravation after 2 days?

341
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,030
-Then you stop.

342
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:22,670
-And I never go up anyway.

343
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:26,700
-You don't go up. You wait. You see what happens after the aggravation.

344
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,750
After the aggravation, you must have an amelioration.

345
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:37,580
The amelioration may last 10 days, 15 days, then you will start going down.

346
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,330
Once you start going down, then you start repeating again.

347
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:42,600
-The same potency?
-The same potency.

348
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:50,170
-I have a problem with Pulsatilla. I see symptoms that contradict to the remedy.

349
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:54,610
She was perspirating very much during the interview, she was perspirating a lot on her face

350
00:48:54,710 --> 00:49:01,950
and on her neck and she said that she would sweat a lot with any short of exertion.

351
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:06,860
The rubric sweat with the slightest exertion, we don't find any Pulsatilla

352
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:13,040
and we don't find any Pulsatilla with sweat on walking.

353
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:27,030
-It is wrong. Pulsatilla sweats a lot. Pulsatilla is one of the remedies

354
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:37,110
 that we use in flashes of heat, in climacteric. A lot of sweat, a lot of heat, no problem.

355
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:53,280
The sweat is like Calc carbo. Calc carbo will perspire in the way she describes.

356
00:49:53,380 --> 00:50:04,710
Also if I remember wellCalc carbo will perspire in the cold air, as she says. I come to the cool air,

357
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:23,820
in a cool room and then I perspire. Can you find this in the Repertory? Perspiration air cool.

358
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:30,300
What are the remedies?

359
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:36,990
-Pulsatilla second degree.

360
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:40,470
-Calcarea carbonica is there?

361
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:45,470
-No, Veratrum Argentum nitricum.

362
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:55,560
-Yes but I'm not perspiring in the cool air. Unless I've been outside in the heat,

363
00:50:55,660 --> 00:51:02,160
I stand a little bit, then I go into a cooler place, then the most perspiring starts.

364
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:21,810
-Show the remedy, perspiration in cold air, you see the Calc carbo is strong

365
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:32,250
but Pulsatillais on perspiration, what is exactly the rubric?

366
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:56,390
-Perspiration during coldness.

367
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:05,110
-No. But it's not what I meant.

368
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:12,640
-This, what you have is not possible to find exactly in the Repertory.

369
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:18,650
We don't' have a problem with this. Why? Because first of all I know that Pulsatilla perspires,

370
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:27,140
as we could see, secondly the symptoms are so strong for Pulsatilla.

371
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:38,310
She is so warm, she wants the air to blow, she cries so easily, she says it's a big problem,

372
00:52:38,410 --> 00:52:48,390
desires bread and butter and all the other symptoms. Show me the repertorisation.

373
00:52:53,910 --> 00:53:01,600
She has strong Pulsatilla symptoms, you like consolation also?

374
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:03,280
-Yes.

375
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:14,530
-Yes but it aggravates also. If I have consolation, I cry.

376
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,870
-She cries more.

377
00:53:31,370 --> 00:53:36,430
-I want you to see the repertorisation because all her symptoms are there.

378
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:39,270
-I don't think that Pulsatilla is a good choice.

379
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:44,770
Concerning to my opinion she said very often that she has this terrible perspiration

380
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:50,720
and she has these stools and she says whenshe can pass stool, she feels better

381
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:58,700
and the swelling up here and I would think of Lachesis ecause she looks as she has emphysema.

382
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:22,430
-No. Lachesis will be a kind of a dangerous remedy to give because if she is not Lachesis

383
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:36,180
it will bring the blood pressure even higher, so we don't go. It is interesting what she says

384
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:46,020
also apart from other symptoms, which is interesting. I don't drink and if I drink cold or

385
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:57,100
ice cream, I get a headache. That is a symptom of Pulsatilla almost alone.

386
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:03,950
 Arsenicum maybe has this sometimes but Pulsatilla has it very strongly

387
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:12,530
and it is a strange symptom because Pulsatilla should like cold, should be ameliorated by cold.

388
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:22,520
It is ameliorated by cold externally but if she eats ice cream, it has be proven that

389
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:36,710
Pulsatilla ice cream, just because it cools down the buccal cavity, it brings up the pain in head.

390
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:50,540
After ice cream, Arsenicum and Pulsatilla.

391
00:55:54,240 --> 00:56:00,530
-In the rubric headaches after cold drinks you find Sulphur and not Pulsatilla.

392
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:02,210
-After cold drinks?

393
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:08,240
-You have to look a little bit further down in the Repertory and then you have cold drinks aggravate

394
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:11,260
and then you have Pulsatilla in it.

395
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:21,840
-Very good. You better be careful next time because I wanted to say, add it.

396
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:37,320
Show me the repertorisation.

397
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:40,800
-You mean the columns.

398
00:56:40,900 --> 00:57:01,080
-Yes the columns and show me why Pulsatilla. It has 14 symptoms or more?

399
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:15,580
14 out of 20 and Nat mur? There was at a certain point there was a possibility of Podophyllum

400
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:36,760
when it comes to the point where she may... fear of robbers, weakness of memory...

401
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,160
How much salt you want?

402
00:57:55,550 --> 00:58:01,010
-No.
-Is she Nat mur?

403
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:20,210
-Forget it, you take it out immediately. That is why many times I said I will not even consider that remedy.

404
00:58:20,310 --> 00:58:26,050
Nat mur do not come into consideration for her case.

405
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:46,300


406
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:46,300
