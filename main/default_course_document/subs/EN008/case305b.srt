1
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,040
-Tell us what happened after Calcarea. You took Calc. carbonica.

2
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:33,950
-Yes while we were here in May, about 14 of May.

3
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,370
-What potency?
-10M.

4
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:47,030
I took it in the afternoon and a few hours later my feet got warmer, more comfortable.

5
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:56,630
I got a bit tired and a bit irritable, I just wanted to be by myself, do things on my way,

6
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:09,380
they made worse 3 days later and from then on I got better and better by day.

7
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:20,710
I had throat pains, stitching pains on swallowing for about a month, slowly decreasing.

8
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:32,620
After a week of emotional aggravation, I got better and better and I had a great time.

9
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:40,200
For a month and a half, two months, lots of energy, no problem in the work.

10
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,960
Everything was just easy and good and I felt so good.

11
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:51,940
Then I spent quite some time by myself, I spent a lot of time by myself

12
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,220
and slowly I felt I had less energy but still when I went to see people

13
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,900
it was OK immediately. I didn't need some time to warm up and feel OK.

14
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,710
-Why did you spend time by yourself?

15
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:12,040
-Something happened during the vacation and things were not planned.

16
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,890
-Did this upset you?

17
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:33,720
-It didn't upset me, it brought me down, I got less energy but still I had some days

18
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:38,890
that I went to see some people and at that time immediately still I felt very good

19
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:43,400
and I could speak easily, felt very much at ease, it was all right.

20
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:51,650
Then later on I just felt that my energy dropped in a couple of days.

21
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,470
-Without reason?

22
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:59,720
-Without reason, I didn't take any coffee, no drugs, nothing.

23
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:07,220
-No antidoting and no some grief, some upset?

24
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:13,380
-Not really but being alone for me is really difficult.

25
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,390
It upsets me very badly, even if I look forward to be alone,

26
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:24,910
that's the way it's been for a long time. That's the way it is.

27
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:45,900
I felt deep, I felt quite low and it's like my situation was back to where it was.

28
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:51,900
-It was really back?
-Yes, that's how it feels.

29
00:03:55,490 --> 00:04:05,530
-You know now how important it is to really evaluate the situation? Very critical.

30
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:42,070
-Since then on, this was in the end of July, then I waited a few days and I sent a fax.

31
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:50,800
You see other times when I get a remedy, you know I gave you a list of remedies

32
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:56,890
and the fact is that I got very good responses, I got very good reactions to those remedies

33
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,050
but it just lasted a short while.

34
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:04,130
Also emotionally-mentally I felt a lot better but then when I repeat it

35
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:10,720
just doesn't do anything. So I thought the same thing is happening this time.

36
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,070
-So you repeated?
-I didn't do anything.

37
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:26,560
-So your energy went down or your emotional?

38
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:35,220
-Both, energy and emotional and then it picked up again a little bit to where it was

39
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:47,740
before the remedy, I would say. But maybe I am a little more centered, more grounded.

40
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,030
-Self-centered?
-Yes.

41
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:12,990
Now I have a small cold now, it started on Monday.

42
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:29,740
Always when I have a cold, I feel more at ease emotionally.

43
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:41,410
Maybe not the first few days but when it starts coming out, I feel more at ease.

44
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:49,810
-Now this cold that you have now, it is strong or mild?

45
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:55,410
-It's mild. I didn't sleep too good last night.

46
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:00,990
-How is your memory?

47
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:09,960
-My memory was much better in the first period, now it's about back to where it was.

48
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:16,710
It's not good, although maybe perhaps is a little better than before the remedy.

49
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,150
That's possible.

50
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:28,890
-Now if you put your problems into perspective, what would you say

51
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:40,730
is the most difficult problem for you? What would you complain at this moment?

52
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:47,210
Let's say we take your case at this moment, what you would complain?

53
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:53,880
-If you asked me yesterday or the day before, I would say I'm not at ease with people,

54
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,830
I feel uneasy.

55
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:16,800
-Why? There is a reason or there is an incident that took place?

56
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,960
-Recently you mean or long time ago?

57
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,070
-An incident.
-Not now.

58
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:34,320
-Feel unease with people, next what you would say?

59
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:41,710
-The problem to be alone, just to be alone for a few hours even if I decide to be alone,

60
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:51,070
I look forward to be alone, even so after a few hours being by myself, brings me down.

61
00:08:51,810 --> 00:09:01,630
That's a really big problem and then it takes time when I'm back with people to feel at ease again.

62
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:06,630
And I want to be around people but I don't want to talk. I just want to be there,

63
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:11,220
don't ask me any questions and then slowly I feel it's all right

64
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,660
and slowly I can also take part to a discussion.

65
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:29,900
-You have said that you had a chill at night in bed. It's still the case now?

66
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,640
-Yes absolutely it is. It was better for a while, for 1-2 months but now I'd say

67
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,820
it's back to where it was.

68
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:52,490
-You had that sadness in the morning on waking, is this still there?

69
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:57,150
-Not so strong. That is not very strong now.

70
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:07,470
-Also you had said that in the morning you had aversion to company.

71
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:10,140
You didn't want anybody in the morning.

72
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:19,710
-Aversion to talk, especially to several people. I feel I don't have energy to expand.

73
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:28,990
-How is that aspect now after the remedy?
-I'd say it's not much different.

74
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:37,050
If there is one person whom I know very well and I feel at ease with, it's no problem.

75
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,810
It's more when there is quite a few people.

76
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:43,650
-Now you stay by yourself here in a room?
-Yes.

77
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:58,660
-How is your thirst?
-I'm thirsty.

78
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:05,670
-For cold water?
-Preferably cold but not ice cold.

79
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:17,890
-In the morning also you had glue in the eyes.
-Yes, mostly in the night when I wake up.

80
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:21,720
Sometimes I have to open with my fingers my eyes.

81
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:27,420
-This symptom is always there or it comes and goes?

82
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:39,030
-Very often, I'm up every night to go to the bathroom once or twice. It's every second night.

83
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:42,060
-But it's still there?
-Yes.

84
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,070
-Was a time where you did not have this?

85
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:53,900
-There have been periods after certain remedies and it could have been OK.

86
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,140
And now when I had a good period in that month and a half, it might not have been there.

87
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,820
I don't recall.

88
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:14,680
-What about your desire for eggs? Is it still there? Soft boiled eggs?

89
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:21,490
-I like eggs, it may not be the great desire but I like eggs.

90
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:29,560
-You had some perspiration in the back, cold perspiration in the back you have said.

91
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:39,750
-Yes at night. It's not so much now, it's more like cold. Sometimes a little bit clammy,

92
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:44,870
very cold, I have to have some comforts and clothing.

93
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,940
-Your feet are again cold?

94
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:54,460
-Yes they are back to where they were, cold and clammy. Definitely very clammy.

95
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:59,220
-Your fears? Fear of poverty?

96
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:09,050
-They were gone, now I'm not so very much concerned with it.

97
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,700
-Fear of being observed?

98
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:21,050
-That fear is still there but it's not being provoked so easily. It's just in situations.

99
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:27,460
It's very strong when it's there and I felt it a few times.

100
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,200
-So it's less but still there.

101
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:39,200
-I would say it's changed after the remedy, I don't know.

102
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,050
-You say, it's still there.
-Yes.

103
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:55,960
-The thirst is while eating still? That still is there.
-Yes absolutely.

104
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:06,780
-The desire for chocolate?
-That decreased after Calcarea.

105
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,650
I could have chocolate and eat a little bit and it was OK.

106
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:15,540
But now it's back. I have to have the whole.

107
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:34,390
-Anxiety about the future was quite strong. How is that?

108
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:43,890
-It's not really very bad but I don't know. It's not a big problem.

109
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:49,870
-You remember you had said that there was discoloration of your tongue.

110
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,360
Usually it was grey.

111
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:59,470
-Yes, that's the same. Usually worse in the morning. Worse when I get a cold.

112
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,970
-Can I see it?

113
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:12,970
-As soon as my feet get wet, very often my tonsils get red.

114
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,380
-You have something else to add?

115
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:01,560
-No, you have the faxes I sent you. That's OK.

116
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:05,130
-But you did not take any other potency, any other remedy?

117
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,720
-No.

118
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:10,890
-OK very good. Let's go inside and discuss your case.

119
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:39,050
What shall we do in this case?

120
00:17:49,550 --> 00:18:00,140
I would like to hear who says wait? Who says repeat?

121
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,630
Who says give another remedy?

122
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:45,210
Do we have new symptoms which have developed after the prescription?

123
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,300


124
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,640
We don't have new symptoms.

125
00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:01,050
Actually all the symptoms are the same except of some mild changes

126
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:09,640
in some mental symptomatology, which even that is not important.

127
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:21,960
There is the fact that he said, he had a reaction in the beginning and then he felt better

128
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:37,480
but for a 10M potency, what he got, he seems to be very short time to have the amelioration.

129
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:48,480
He says, 2 months amelioration and then I'm back, it is very strange

130
00:19:48,580 --> 00:20:01,470
unless some stress has happened. It seems he is very sensitive to the fact that he is alone.

131
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:06,230
He likes to be with people. He likes to have company.

132
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:12,460
If he is alone, his energy goes down and then perhaps this creates a situation

133
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:21,810
where he feels himself isolated and his energy goes down.

134
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:34,650
Therefore his remedy is "find some company".

135
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:59,360
Also what he says, that in every remedy he takes, the reaction is the same,

136
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:06,360
it's a little bit strange. It can not be possible.

137
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:15,510
So he has an impression or he doesn't care very much or he is not observant

138
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:21,370
but it is not possible with every remedy, he has the same reaction.

139
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:38,510
If he says, with any remedy he has the same reaction, first an aggravation,

140
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:47,770
then amelioration for a short period of time, then we can be thinking about the placebo effect.

141
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:54,550
Do we have here a placebo effect? We have to examine that possibility,

142
00:21:54,650 --> 00:22:03,570
if he says with every remedy, I feel better. Do we have here the possibility of placebo?

143
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:18,640
It is possible except for one little detail. Which is this detail?

144
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:26,200
-The aggravation?

145
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:36,690
-The aggravation happened with other remedies?
-Not really.

146
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:41,290
-With the other remedies you had just the amelioration.

147
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:50,180
There is another detail which made me think, most probably this is not a placebo,

148
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,530
which is that detail?

149
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,870
-The feet became very warm.

150
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:11,120
-This is typical, the feet are typically cold with Calcarea carbonica.

151
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:19,790
The time that you take Calcarea carb. you can not say that the placebo is I feel my feet are warm, no.

152
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:24,380
The placebo effect is I feel better.

153
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:29,850
But to say that I have an aggravation but my feet got immediately warm,

154
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:37,680
it means there is an action of the remedy. If there is an action of the remedy and the

155
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:44,780
remedy has acted correctly, first aggravation, then amelioration, what is the conclusion?

156
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:54,930
The conclusion is that the potency of the remedy is not strong enough, is not the correct

157
00:23:55,030 --> 00:24:05,430
and therefore we have to change the potency or to change the repetition of the remedy,

158
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:07,890
if we don't change the potency.

159
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:43,350
Also the fact that he took a lot of remedies, if you remember he had a list of 30 remedies

160
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:46,440
he had taken, high potencies.

161
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:57,610
Therefore this kind of treatment by having an organism with too many potencies,

162
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:03,690
we see that the reactions are not as should be expected.

163
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:12,770
That's why, in such cases, I usually repeat. I did not repeat in his case

164
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:25,800
but I remember I suggested a higher potency in his case. I suggested 10M or 50M.

165
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:31,800
-10M and then 50M you said.

166
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:42,740
-That's it. But you got only 10M because we could not find the 50M. Is that correct?

167
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,730
You see how much a science it is?

168
00:25:52,830 --> 00:26:00,060
I said something is wrong, it's not possible to remember all details in all cases,

169
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:07,490
as you can understand, but it is definite that I said this case needs to go higher.

170
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:18,980
Now I gave 10M in this case? I had doubts. And actually I said 10M and 50M

171
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:23,500
to be sure that he gets a high potency.

172
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:42,000
So this time you are going to get 50M every day for the rest of your life!

173
00:26:55,260 --> 00:27:11,900
You get 50M. The problem is I don't know if...here I don't have 50M in my medicines.

174
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,100
Otherwise I would have given it to you.

175
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,360
-There is a pharmacy, they can bring it Kostas.

176
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:31,400
-Yes, there is a pharmacy, they can bring 50M. And you take it for a few days every day.

177
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:36,810
If you have a reaction, even with the first remedy, you stop.

178
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:44,300
But if there is no reaction, you continue. You can continue up to 10 days, taking 50M.

179
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,930
-What happened?

180
00:27:54,430 --> 00:28:08,920
-I took 4 intakes of Calcarea 50M. The first morning I woke up in good spirit, it felt just great.

181
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,720
But I kept on taking it another 3 intakes because I wanted to make sure.

182
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:23,730
Then I got more and more tired and I stopped and then slowly I recovered. It took me a month.

183
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:36,400
It was a slow, good recovery. It felt very good. And all the autumn, it went fine.

184
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,000
It went better and better.

185
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:50,970
Then during Christmas I had some difficult days, being with my family, it felt very painful.

186
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:59,480
I was where I grew up and they were very nice, they wanted to do the best for me

187
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:04,080
but I felt very alone. It was very difficult.

188
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:12,900
So I thought I have a real relapse but then after a few days, I have some very good friends there.

189
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,480
I stayed with them and I recovered. But not back to where I was.

190
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:28,730
I felt I was a little more tense, not the same. Then in January I had a real bad relapse.

191
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,750
That took me about a month to recover.

192
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:37,670
-Did you repeat the remedy?
-No.

193
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:43,160
-Why in January, there was a reason?

194
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:49,740
-I over worked, I wasn't careful. I have to be quite careful eating regularly during the day.

195
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,440
I wasn't careful enough and I pushed myself.

196
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,830
-Did you drink some coffee?
-No.

197
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:13,180
I got really down and then slowly I recovered again but a little lower, I didn't go back.

198
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:19,250
-Did you take any marihuana?
-No, nothing.

199
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,590
-No other medication.

200
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:35,090
-Then two months later, mid March also, it's a kind of a relapse but recovered again quite quickly.

201
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:45,560
But I noticed that I can not stay so well alone, as I could in the autumn.

202
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:58,400
I need to be more careful eating regularly. My feet start to perspire again quite heavily

203
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:03,680
since the beginning of April, clammy feet.

204
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:16,010
-Cold and perspiring.
-Yes. I still am quite cold at night, in bed.

205
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:22,400
-Lately you felt more the cold?

206
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:29,170
-It was better in the autumn but now during the winter it's been more cold.

207
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:32,590
But it hasn't been back to where it was before.

208
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:47,070
-Also you had mentioned a chill in bed in the night. That is still coming?

209
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:49,760
-Yes it's still coming but not so strong.

210
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:03,740
-The perspiration in bed in the night?

211
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:10,350
-Occasionally yes, it can happen but not so often.

212
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:15,150
-Desire for chocolate is still there?
-Yes.

213
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:21,150
-Desire for eggs?
-Yes, yes definitely.

214
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,660
-Even more than before?
-Not more.

215
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:30,840
-For soft boiled or hard boiled?
-Soft boiled.

216
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:43,590
-You had thirst while eating? You still have?
-Yes a lot.

217
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:51,490
-Only while eating?
-Not only while eating, over all, quite big thirst.

218
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:58,660
-The water has to be cold?
-Not icy cold, normal.

219
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,510
-What about ice cream?
-I like it very much.

220
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:12,160
-Your color has changed. You became more red, because of the sun here or what?

221
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:16,340
-I haven't been in the sun here. I arrived yesterday afternoon.

222
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:27,680
-You are more red.
-I don't know why.

223
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:40,910
-How is your timidity?
-It's much better.

224
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:47,350
It's not really a problem, especially in meetings I have no problems

225
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:56,420
but lately I've been a little more nervous and timid in some situations.

226
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:08,270
Not so relaxed, as I used to be but then in important meetings, it's no problem at all.

227
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:15,010
It's almost that I get too excited about things.

228
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,760
-And communicative?
-Yes.

229
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:25,910
-I don't remember you are married?
-No.

230
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:30,140
-And still you are not married?

231
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,470
-No, I'm alone, I'm single for a year and a half.

232
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:41,310
-You don't know now? You are thinking?

233
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,250
-We'll see. Possible something it's happening now.

234
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:11,180
-You had a tongue which was coated grey.
-Still coated, particularly in the morning.

235
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:18,760
-What about vertigo from high places?

236
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:25,890
-I think it might be better. I haven't try but I feel it might be better.

237
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:30,560
But I remember leaving here on the plane, just looking down from the plane, I was feeling...

238
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:35,000
-Nervous.
-Yes but now I think it's better.

239
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:44,080
I still when I get up at night to go to the toilet, I have to drink cold water

240
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:49,820
because I feel so dry inside. Just one sip.

241
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:56,740
-The thirst has increased lastly or you say it's more or less the same?

242
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:02,960
-I'm more physically active now, so maybe I drink a little more.

243
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:10,820
-We have to decide whether you take another dose.

244
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,670
-Right.

245
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,500
-What do you think? Should you take a dose?
-I think so.

246
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:23,830
-You waited a long time?
-I waited a long time.

247
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:27,150
-It's not usual for you. How many remedies you had taken before?

248
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:30,000
-I have taken 24 remedies.

249
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:35,820
-That's all right. Let's go inside.

250
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,330
-Thank you very much. It's been great.

251
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:14,050
You see on this case that we just saw, only the computer was thinking is Cal. carbonica.

252
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:21,640
Nobody else, if you remember. We all had doubts about this case.

253
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:29,900
What shall we do now? Shall we give another dose, yes or no?

254
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:42,520
-It's a miracle he didn't take one yet.

255
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:50,640
-Sure. This is interesting also for you to see, many times we have said

256
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:55,070
that the cure will go like this.

257
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:59,880
Sometimes will go down but never down like this when it's started.

258
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:07,380
It will go up and then down and then up again and you have to take into consideration this

259
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:11,740
and not jump into the picture and prescribe.

260
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:28,070
You see how difficult it is to judge, when is the time to repeat.

261
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:50,320
If I put to you the same questions for 1,2,3,4, as I put the previous one,

262
00:38:52,820 --> 00:39:06,060
1 wait, 2 repeat, 3 higher, 4 another, which one of these is for him?

263
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:18,320
Who says 1? Who says 2? Who says 3?

264
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:27,820
Who says 4? You better don't raise your hand in 4.

265
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,830
None of these answers is correct for him.

266
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:20,320
Let's say 5, lower potency. Who is for lower potency?

267
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,410
None of these is correct.

268
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:43,160
I'll tell you, it's very simple.

269
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:58,210
-You have to marry!

270
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:08,280
-Yes, give Calc. carbonica everybody will marry.

271
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:24,530
In this case what we see, he is doing quite well. He, himself realizes that finally.

272
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:36,210
He says, I'm starting going down and most of you said, wait.

273
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:50,110
This is correct wait for the time being. That means we're not absolutely sure at this moment.

274
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:55,600
At this moment he comes for consultation. His next possibility will be after 6 months.

275
00:41:55,700 --> 00:42:00,070
Shall we let him wait for 6 months or we give him another direction?

276
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:13,180
The direction for me will be that if he continues really to be going down,

277
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:18,700
then he can repeat the 50M.

278
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:34,850
At this moment it is in the border, though the key symptoms are there

279
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:43,610
and especially what is the key symptom for him to say that we can go ahead and repeat,

280
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:47,280
what is the one symptom he said?

281
00:42:49,960 --> 00:43:00,940
One symptom he gave us, makes us almost certain that he needs a repetition.

282
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:07,010
Which is this symptom?
-Clammy feet.

283
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:14,940
-The clammy feet being typical of Cal. carbonica, when he says

284
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:22,370
I lately started having clammy feet, then he gives us the right to prescribe.

285
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:31,700
It is almost certain that he will need the Cal. carbonica.

286
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:46,110
Also the fact that he still feels the cold, the fact that he perspires in the night.

287
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:52,670
The fact that he likes the eggs, as much as he used to like, that means that still the

288
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:59,510
Cal. carbonica layer is there and not only is there and it's coming back.

289
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:08,180
We'll give him a margin of one month more to wait.

290
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:18,080
After the month the right answer is, wait here, if still the symptoms are continuing to go down

291
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:21,580
and you have your clammy feet, then

292
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:29,510
take a repetition of Cal. carbonica. This is the right answer.

293
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:55,360
24 remedies you see the problem we all have? We have to find the correct remedy.

294
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:10,840
-Then take another dose of 50M.

295
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:11,580
-Did you take?

296
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,750
-Yes, what happened was, I didn't tell you while I was here.

297
00:45:13,850 --> 00:45:22,330
I had a bad hay fever. So it developed and got worse day by day.

298
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:25,750
So I felt it was going down to my chest.

299
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:32,420
It was raining and I felt it was going down to my chest and I had cold perspiration

300
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:37,430
all over the body, I went to bed, I had to get up immediately, I was just all sweat.

301
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:44,190
So I took the remedy then and immediately I felt like I was warmer in the body and also in my head.

302
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:55,940
From then, it was Wednesday and by next Sunday the whole thing was gone, more or less.

303
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:58,260
-Since then what happened?

304
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:11,830
-Since then I went home, I had one bad dream after 1-2 weeks. This dream was about my mother,

305
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:18,830
I had the dream that it was me and her and another person between us,

306
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:28,780
we were looking straight ahead forward and I was just standing there and she was about to leave.

307
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:35,760
She knew I was there but she didn't want to see me, she just ignored me.

308
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:40,840
There was a person, I don't remember who it was, we were standing really close to one another

309
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:48,280
and she was gonna leave for good. I knew it was for good.

310
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:57,920
The feeling was, I never felt that thing so bad in my life. I can not...

311
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:06,010
You have to be a child to understand the pain somehow. I woke up and as soon as I woke up,

312
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:09,430
the pain was gone, I was out of it immediately.

313
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:28,070
I didn't do anything, I didn't act, I was there. My mother is dead. That's OK.

314
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:36,740
-Very interesting. Do you realize what is this dream?

315
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:47,570
-The pain reappearing again I suppose. But being a kind solved or not quite perhaps, I'm not sure.

316
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:52,720
-Then after that what happened?

317
00:47:57,230 --> 00:48:01,620
-Things were developing slowly, gradually went better and things were doing fine

318
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:13,880
until the end of July, 24th of July I went for the wedding of my brother

319
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:24,700
and I was doing a lot of driving and I had a relapse on that time.

320
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,300
I felt depressed and I couldn't get over it.

321
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:34,450
-You said you were going to the wedding of your brother.

322
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:37,230
For first time?
-Yes.

323
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:41,370
-And while you were going you got depressed?

324
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:46,210
-Not while. During that period of time it was also my vacation and it was a time

325
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:48,810
where I spent some time alone.

326
00:48:49,390 --> 00:49:00,780
Also there was another thing happening, in this wedding was a woman that I was very fond of

327
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,970
but it was very much my imagination.

328
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:08,570
I build great things out of little signs.

329
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:23,790
-So you suddenly realized that this was your own thing and then you just got depressed

330
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:29,460
and you started going down?
-Yes slowly.

331
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:33,700
It always happen quite suddenly, in a couple of days I'm down.

332
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:38,370
Not to where I was, I've never been down to where I was before I started the Calcarea, not close.

333
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:46,220
But still it's down. But I said I wait, sometimes it comes up by itself.

334
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,420
So I waited a month but it didn't change.

335
00:49:49,920 --> 00:50:05,500
So I repeated in 20th of August, I repeated Calcarea 50M for 2 intakes and it was very good.

336
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:12,260
-You came out of the depression?
-Yes next day.

337
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:23,000
I guess I didn't tell before when I get a relapse I immediately feel that

338
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:27,330
I don't want to see people, I want to hide, I don't want them see how I am

339
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:33,000
and also I feel so worried that I'll never get back, I'll never get OK.

340
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:36,600
Always it will be like this. Those two things are so strong.

341
00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:41,990
-Despair of recover and you don't want anybody to see how you feel.

342
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:48,010
-No, like they can see through me and it's so painful. This is something I had all along.

343
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,740
But I still feel I could defend myself more.

344
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:56,260
It's not like I am so vulnerable like I used to be but it's still painful.

345
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:06,350
But then I recovered slowly, I had a headache for some days and it was very good.

346
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:17,680
In general I feel very good. My life is going very well, I'm very happy with things.

347
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:22,180
-OK, we are also happy.

348
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:27,910
-Just one thing I want to say here because while I'm here, studying I just realized

349
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:29,670
that I can't make a case.

350
00:51:29,770 --> 00:51:35,350
When I'm unable I just think so deep, it can take me 1-2 days to recover

351
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:37,070
just from not making a case

352
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:42,090
and I make very haste decisions but then I'm quite sure this must be it

353
00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:44,790
and then I realized it's not.

354
00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:46,420
-And you get disappointed?

355
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:56,910
-Deeply and I have to be careful not to. My feelings go so much up and down.

356
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:03,430
I have to protect myself more, if I can and I can most of the time.

357
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:37,650
This is an interesting dream; can anybody tell me what signifies this dream?

358
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:57,210
-Maybe I'm getting into dangerous waters but I think it's finally growing up for good

359
00:52:57,310 --> 00:52:59,370
and letting the mother go.

360
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:11,540
-Letting go. The idea of holding the relationship and holding the attachment to the mother

361
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:18,720
which was very, very strong, finally on a sub-conscious level he decides to let it go.

362
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:24,470
That's it what it is.

363
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:39,990
It is very clear, very interesting and shows how deep the homeopathic remedy will act.

364
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:48,810
It goes to the sub-conscious mind and releases it.

365
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:08,960
Another thing also which is interesting, talking about the project of confirming,

366
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:19,050
in his case you will confirm despair of recovery which we have it in black letters

367
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:30,540
and also you will confirm this fear of others, they can see how you feel,

368
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:35,820
if you are a Calcarea carbonica. Your fear that the others will see me.

369
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:49,590
But what is interesting also is that from a disappointment Calcarea goes into depression.

370
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:52,180
Depression after disappointment.

371
00:54:57,690 --> 00:55:03,820
And not love disappointment necessarily, any kind of disappointment.

372
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:17,310
You have to be able to see the progress in a case.

373
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:20,720
If you can not see, you have a problem and this is very serious

374
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:26,720
because the moment that you don't understand whether a case has progressed or not,

375
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:33,080
you are tending to give a remedy untimely.

376
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:37,490
You did not see the difference between the Pulsatilla?

377
00:55:37,590 --> 00:55:39,200
You saw that also.

378
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:49,140
What you are saying is when one remedy is indicated, then I can see the difference.

379
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:51,240
This is what you are saying.

380
00:55:54,240 --> 00:56:04,140
What I say is that you have to be careful because in case we have cases more complicated

381
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:12,580
belonging to the second or third group, then you will have a problem recognizing the progress.

382
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:20,740
Then that is very bad because you are going to spoil your case very easily.

383
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:26,890
-Don't you think since the second relapse already that came after 6 -8 weeks,

384
00:56:26,990 --> 00:56:30,330
don't you think that maybe we should raise the potency?

385
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:44,160
-I think we should be careful to have better potentization of remedies.

386
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:56,530
I don't know how much is this due to the not good effective potentisation of the remedy.

387
00:56:57,990 --> 00:57:05,230
We may have a problem on that level when the remedy is not potentized properly.

388
00:57:05,330 --> 00:57:14,830
When we say 50.000 times, can you imagine? A robot will take one month to prepare one remedy.

389
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:27,220
So if any pharmacy stops after 2.000 times instead of 50.000 times, still you will not be able

390
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:30,240
to recognize it and that's the problem.

391
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:36,150
Another problem is the pollution in which we live today.

392
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:43,270
The pollution in which we live can lead us very easily to relapses.

393
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:45,150
I'll give you an example.

394
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:54,900
During the war in Kosovo we saw very frequent relapses of the people

395
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,330
who stayed in the North of Greece.

396
00:57:58,670 --> 00:58:09,250
The Thessaloniki area and the Greek North, the relapses were much more than usual.

397
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:21,570
So the pollution and what is going on with the expansion of this radiation from the handies,

398
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:34,070
you see the antennas all over, we are bombarded with radio waves, TV waves, antennas,

399
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:37,500
we're just sent signals all the time.

400
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:45,310
How much this is affecting us and how much the body can resist I don't know.

401
00:58:45,410 --> 00:58:56,420
So the relapse is a fact of several factors, not only one.

402
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:04,340
Not only bad constitution or bad preparation of the remedy.
