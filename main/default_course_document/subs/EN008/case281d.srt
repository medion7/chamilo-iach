1
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:38,900
-When I come home I still was very distended, the same as before, even more.

2
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:51,990
Every day I had the same constipation, nothing happened with that

3
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:04,800
but I have in the middle of July I had very little menses and that was the first time

4
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:10,150
since nearly 2 years because the menses had stopped.

5
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,740
It was about that time that I fax to you, I think I got a fax back.

6
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,720
-What did you say in the fax?

7
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,890
-I just said that I was very bad because I was very bad.

8
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:43,170
The summer in Norway was very good, hot, sunny, it was relaxing for me

9
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:50,920
and I went on vacation. Everything should be very good but this distention goes on,

10
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,170
every day.

11
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:05,590
I feel very tight sometimes but it was more tight when I started working again.

12
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:15,520
In August no more vacation. The tightness is still there, especially in the evening.

13
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,920
It goes with the bloatedness, I'm sure of that, I feel  that. I don't sleep so good either.

14
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:32,170
I sleep bad than before China, more restless, more sub-conscious in a way,

15
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:40,420
lots of dream every night but I dream about the usual things, what happens in the day

16
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:49,610
or I mix it with things before, people from the past in my life.

17
00:02:53,610 --> 00:03:06,590
I take the Silica 200 12 of August and it didn't happen so much.

18
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:27,920
After Pulsatilla I had not so much desire for soft boiled eggs, I always had desire

19
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:34,770
for soft boiled eggs. It was less after Pulsatilla, with the Silica it comes back again.

20
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:51,760
I'm still quite thirsty, maybe a little less. After Pulsatilla I noticed that

21
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:58,760
in the evening at home, it could be chilly and before I never noticed.

22
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:04,760
I just sit there and people say aren't you cold? Now I more notice and I put

23
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:12,510
some more clothes but I'm still more warm than cold person and I still need

24
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:18,440
the fresh air for my head and all that stuff. It's the same.

25
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:37,610
But little changed, always here in Alonissos, I can go to the toilet, I have stool every day.

26
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:44,690
But this time for some days nothing, so this changed.

27
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,920
-But you said last time, here you had constipation.

28
00:04:53,020 --> 00:05:03,680
-No, in past, 7 years ago always when I travel, I go more worse but in Greece it's better.

29
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:08,440
The last 5-6 years Greece is better, it's always better here.

30
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:17,180
But I tried the same at home to eat Greek salad with olives but it doesn't work.

31
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:29,330
So I feel it's something to do with the bacteria. It's another bacteria here than home,

32
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,760
I'm not sure about it.

33
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:46,260
But after Silica I have more perspiration in the groin again because I never perspire here.

34
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,410
I took away this many years ago, I told you.

35
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:57,100
But sometimes I can perspire in the groin and that's worse after Silica.

36
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:22,500
I still have bad concentration when I'm studying, when I'm reading a book to study

37
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,930
after work, half an hour and I'm tired.

38
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:37,680
But I'm still more relaxed than before, I do less things and I work little less,

39
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:46,350
I can stay a week by myself because I don't need company.

40
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:54,080
That had been better for a long time, I think I' m not sure if it's after Pulsatilla.

41
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,680
Maybe before.

42
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:04,860
-Here you had said last time you were in a hurry, you wanted to do a lot of things.

43
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:14,930
Now you say...
-I still do things but...

44
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:23,500
-But I see a big change in your face, I see much relaxation, you got a new boyfriend

45
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,350
or something?

46
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,770
-It's from 1 year, little more but we have a little...

47
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,670
-You seem more satisfied.
-Yes, I am.

48
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:44,470
-Can you tell us why?

49
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:54,420
-Yes, I moved in his house very soon, very fast. I don't do that.

50
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,870
I use to be with a person for at least 2-3 years, so I take a big challenge

51
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:03,770
and it works very good. Just sometimes...

52
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:10,170
but I think that's natural because we didn't' t know each other so well,

53
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:13,270
so I feel quite well about that.

54
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:19,770
He is very relaxing man, he is very kind man, spoiled me in a way.

55
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:32,100
-Tell me in the morning how you wake in the morning?

56
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:42,340
-If I slept good, the best for me is in the morning but before I could go to 5 or 6 sometimes

57
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:48,330
but now I hate that. I don't want to go before 7 o'clock.

58
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:54,260
If I have a good night I can stand up to 7 o'clock, I'm quite refreshed

59
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:02,760
but if I have this restless sleep, subconscious and all that, I'm not so awake.

60
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:10,500
So during the day my best time is before noon but after noon is going more and more down

61
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:17,000
and in the evening I'm very tired but it's a little better than the other time.

62
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:24,250
So I'm a little better because I can stay up more to 10.30, 11.00 instead

63
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:28,600
of being so tired at 9 and want to go to bed.

64
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:49,280
This summer I eat sausages because I never eat that because of the pork and that fat.

65
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:57,310
I take the chance and I eat some and I think I'm sensitive to everything,

66
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,780
so it doesn't matter, so I eat them 2 times.

67
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,030
-It makes no difference the pork sausages.

68
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:17,900
-I try to eat something else too but I never eat something with wheat,

69
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,900
some fine cakes with the wheat.

70
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:31,920
I don't eat that stuff because I cant' handle it so well.

71
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,810
-What about the potatoes? Did you eat potatoes?

72
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:43,400
-No, I try to avoid them, just a couple of times but I can see so much difference because

73
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:49,000
I feel I'm more, every day it's the distention now.

74
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:57,900
From morning before eating and then it goes on, in the evening sometimes it's very big,

75
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,750
sometimes not big, it depends on what I eat, I'm not sure.

76
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,080
-What time is the distention.

77
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:32,730
-I would say 7-8 and I always have to eat regularly. If I don't do that, I have distention too

78
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:40,330
and that can be earlier in the day. If it goes for 4-5 hours, it's very big.

79
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:52,310
-But tell me, you said potatoes you ate twice?
-Yes 2 times.

80
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:55,310
-What was the effect of potatoes?

81
00:11:55,410 --> 00:12:02,310
-I'm not sure because before I was investigating more what I could have.

82
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,420
-Why?

83
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:11,600
-Because I knew I couldn't have milk products, I couldn't take potatoes,

84
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:18,280
but that was more lately, 2 years ago and fruits also.

85
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:24,650
-How is your reaction to this now?

86
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:35,330
-I think I react on everything, it's difficult to tell because I feel it's every day.

87
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:42,400
-Your distention is more.
-Yes it's more often.

88
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:49,650
Before I could have some days, it was OK and before that again some years ago,

89
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:55,900
I could have weeks. Some weeks was good and then it started again and I always notice

90
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,430
because if I eat milk products I was worse but now I can't tell

91
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:07,230
because I feel everything in a way makes me that.

92
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:14,580
If I eat very little, maybe it's little, if not mix too much.

93
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:22,030
So in the morning I eat eggs, sardines, maybe some tuna fish.

94
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:27,630
-Sardines in the morning?
-Yes I like them very much.

95
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,630
-You like the fish?
-I like fish.

96
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:38,110
-What about sweets?

97
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:44,220
-Not so much, I feel sometimes for it but I can't.

98
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:53,360
I know that's bad, a little bit of chocolate and sweets and it's bad for me

99
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,000
but I like chocolates.

100
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:07,960
I have no big desire, I never had that, maybe when I was 14 but not now.

101
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:21,800
I more feel for strong spice or food with taste, olives, caviar, smoked lamb.

102
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:28,280
-Can you tell me psychologically more differences between what you feel now

103
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:33,380
and before the treatment? Can you make an evaluation? What do you think?

104
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:46,130
-After November last year I sold my house.

105
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:54,650
That house was very big trouble for me for long time because it was lots of accidents there,

106
00:14:54,750 --> 00:15:02,200
lots of stuff and I lived together with another, all these troubles.

107
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:16,780
But I was alone last year in summer, I meet this man and I was intending to sell my house

108
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:27,780
before I met him and I had investigated to have an apartment but he said, why you rush,

109
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,130
can't you live here and relax?

110
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:36,200
In the beginning I think that's stupid because we knew each other very little

111
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:42,870
but after a while I think why not, I can try and I feel very relaxed in this place.

112
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:50,450
It's very quite place, very small cozy house, I don't have much to do there

113
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,700
because he does so much.

114
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,650
-So therefore you feel better?
-I feel better after Pulsatilla I'm not sure.

115
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:05,650
-So you sold the house because it was a big problem for you, you felt much release after

116
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:14,780
selling and then you met this man with whom you are doing quite well together,

117
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,530
as I understand.
-Yes.

118
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:21,030
-Therefore you feel better.
-Yes I feel better.

119
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,530
-Why don't you say it?

120
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:29,110
-Yes I feel better, mentally I feel good for a while.

121
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:38,610
-But why when I ask you to say how you are, you don't say it? You are afraid to say it?

122
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:47,700
-No, still we know each other for 13 months, I 'm a little bit,

123
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:53,630
I always feel insecurity in relationships.

124
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:08,980
-Have they found amoebas in your stool?
-What do you mean? Salmonella?

125
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:19,950
-Not Salmonella, it's something else.
-I don't know.

126
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:27,450
-Have you been to Africa at all as holiday?
-No.

127
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:36,450
-To East?
-I was to Mexico one time.

128
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:47,550
-How long?
-Just one week.

129
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:53,450
-Then you got something?
-Yes because I had diarrhea.

130
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,780
-And he gave you some medicine.
-Yes.

131
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:11,130
-When it was this Mexican story?
-I think it's 10 years ago.

132
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:18,230
-You have not mentioned vegetables? Do you take vegetables?

133
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:24,660
-Yes. I like it very much but it's better cooked than raw.

134
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:27,610
-If you eat raw vegetables?

135
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:33,210
-A distention is a lot but I love vegetables, so I eat them.

136
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,110
-Do you remember how many years is the distention?

137
00:18:39,210 --> 00:19:01,640
-Many years. Aggravation started after that trip to Spain, in 1978, 20 years ago.

138
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:07,150
I had the diarrhea and I had this salmonella worm.

139
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:16,470
-And you were treated for that in Spain?
-No.

140
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,080
-How do you know it was salmonella?

141
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:23,880
-Because when I came back the doctor in Norway...

142
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:30,040
I had diarrhea there and when I came home after 2 days I had no diarrhea

143
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:34,290
and after that constipation and a distention very much.

144
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:40,790
I had been constipated since I was a small child 2-3 years old but the distention...

145
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:41,990
-Started at 1978.

146
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:50,380
-Yes, after that comes and goes and I travel many times in the States

147
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:59,840
and it's always worse the constipation, it's very bad there because of the food.

148
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:08,140
If I don't take clesma [enema] I can go 14 days.

149
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:28,370
2 years ago I could alternate, 2-3-4 days constipated and then go one day but not anymore,

150
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:36,720
not since Pulsatilla. So I had to use clesmatic [enema] after one week.

151
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:52,730
But if it's a party, not too often, if I take alcohol some days I can go several times.

152
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:03,120
-Do you take some laxatives to help?
-No.

153
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:08,880
-So when you say constipation you mean you go every second day?

154
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:18,720
-No, I don't go. I can go a week without and then ...

155
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:24,640
-And then what you do?
-Clysmatic.

156
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,710
-You use only water?

157
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:33,340
-And some herbs that belong to the machine.

158
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:45,010
-How frequently you had to use this? How many times the month?

159
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,380
-I just use it since last time. Before that I could use after a long time

160
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:58,630
because I could go after some days and I could go one day several times.

161
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:05,730
It's just now I started to use it again.

162
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:20,040
-How frequently?
-Not so many times, I think 4.

163
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:26,540
-For the past 2 months how many times you used it?

164
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:42,560
-Not much, 5-6 I'm not sure. If I had a party, if I drink alcohol, I can go.

165
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:49,960
I can drink alcohol every day, that will function but if I drink alcohol in the weekend

166
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:58,140
I can go to the toilet the day after. But I thought that was usual for people to do that.

167
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:06,140
-No, it's not. It's only for you.

168
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:20,540
In the previous interview you have said that alcohol makes you worse,

169
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,290
is that what you call worse?
-No.

170
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:26,040
-What is the worse?

171
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:41,290
-That I had to take very little, otherwise I got very tired in the same evening.

172
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:48,710
Everybody gets tired the day after, me too but I get tired already after a couple of hours.

173
00:23:48,810 --> 00:24:01,390
It makes me like a jelly. I need very little.

174
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:09,290
-Before?
-Some years ago I could have a lot more.

175
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:18,310
-Before Pulsatilla you could drink and have stool or this appeared after?

176
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:21,540
-This has been for many years, if I drink alcohol...

177
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,290
-If you drink you go.

178
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:33,720
-Yes but if I drink seldom, once the week, not every day, if I take a cup of glass every day...

179
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:40,960
-OK, now you drank some wine. The last 2 months you drank 1 or 2 times?

180
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:46,050
-In the summertime we drink a little wine every day, it's vacations.

181
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:52,050
-So now you drink every day.
-Not now but in the summer I do that.

182
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:57,380
-In the summer did you feel the same reaction from alcohol?

183
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:02,380
-No, if I drink every day it's not the same reaction.

184
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,880
-So you don't feel tired?
-Yes, tiredness yes.

185
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:13,480
I had to take a little bit. If I take more, I feel very tired.

186
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:25,880
-And if you take more, you will have a stool now? If you have a party you said,

187
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:32,410
you will drink some alcohol and then you will have stool, is that correct?

188
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:38,070
-Yes, so wine with some other little something.

189
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:44,210
Because we have a party on Saturday and before that I haven't drink something before,

190
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:52,210
for a couple of weeks and then it  function. It's like coffee.

191
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:58,150
If I take usual coffee now, I think it will function too.

192
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:04,150
-Do you drink any coffee in this time?
-No, just decaffeinated.

193
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:16,300
-Do you have any tendency, any urge to go for stool or no urge?

194
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:29,550
-For a while before Silica I feel very little urge. After Silica maybe more urge.

195
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:37,300
So I have urge and I can have a little bit sometimes. Before I'm going in here it was

196
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:42,300
a little bit because it was anticipation and that has been before too.

197
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,980
If I had anticipation but I think that's usual.

198
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:56,160
-In your country do you have zucchini?
-I'm not sure about it.

199
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,960
-You don't know zucchini?

200
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:26,780
Now, what I want to understand, the distention is as big, strong as before

201
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,130
or it is not so strong but every day?

202
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:59,030
-I think it's nearly the same because before it was 2-3 days it was better and then

203
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:02,080
it was very, very big sometimes.

204
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:07,800
And now it's very big sometimes and not so big but it's every day.

205
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:18,200
Maybe it has been 1 or 2 mornings that I fell notthing because it was always

206
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:24,050
little beginning in the morning before the evening.

207
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:29,200
-Your diet is the same as before or you changed your diet?

208
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:42,400
-No, I don't change, I start eating wheat again, I had a little bit of wheat before too

209
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,370
but I started eating a little bit more.

210
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:56,450
Because the doctor say they want to take a new sample, a new blood test because

211
00:28:56,550 --> 00:29:01,050
when they did it the last time, that was not sure.

212
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:06,020
The wheat was on the limit, the wheat flour.

213
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:11,330
-I don't understand.
-Allergy test.

214
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:24,680
-Yes they told me to eat more wheat again but it doesn't matter because I was worse

215
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:28,400
before I eat more wheat and then I stopped it again.

216
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,650
-So it makes no difference.
-No difference.

217
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:37,100
-Potatoes also make no difference? Milk, did you drink milk?

218
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:44,110
-I never drink it but I think sometimes because I feel like it but if I take little more,

219
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:45,710
I feel it's no good.

220
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:50,120
-What about fruits? Do you take fruits now?

221
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:54,950
-I take some fruits but it makes distention.

222
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:59,710
I don't take apple because I know that's the worse but I take grapes, I love them so much

223
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:02,550
but distention too.

224
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:17,780
-There is a desire for soft eggs, real desire?

225
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:26,120
-Yes, I nearly eat them every morning and I have 2 soft boiled eggs, really every morning.

226
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:33,360
Sometimes I don't do it but I have something else.

227
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:47,290
-Very well, I see you have lost weight.
-I don't think so. I have no scale.

228
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:52,440
-From the first time I saw you, you have the same weight you think?

229
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:57,940
-I think, nearly the same. This summer I put some weight. I know because I feel it.

230
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:06,690
After Pulsatilla I think I eat more and this summer it was so relaxing and we had

231
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:15,940
a lot more food in a way than I'm used to, so I eat more.

232
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:25,790
Maybe I went a little bit down again after Silica but I think I'm nearly the same since May.

233
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:31,220
-Not May, in the beginning I say.

234
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:36,270
-I changed very little because I nearly have the same way since I was 16,

235
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:46,120
maybe 2 kilos up and down. I'm between 53,55, 58 kilos.

236
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:21,170
You remember in the first interview the psychological state in which was and all this?

237
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:30,910
Together with a chronic cough. She forgot to say, she says the cough is totally gone.

238
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:39,650
We just complain. Now the fact is that still she has a digestive problem

239
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:48,660
but in order to be able to predict or to make a good prognosis we have

240
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:57,660
to understand the pathology, as I said, and we here we have some kind of a pathology which is,

241
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:13,090
in a way, persistent and it is localized of course in lower part of the digestive track.

242
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:22,940
Now what is the problem? Can anybody tell me? Do we have an enterologist,

243
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:26,260
gastroenterologist in the class?

244
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:47,820
The symptoms which she has and the aggravation from certain food indicate

245
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:54,920
a particular pathology, which is in the Mediterranean mostly.

246
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:04,900
-She told me several times I was so good in China, my stomach problems were so much better

247
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,410
and the cough was gone.

248
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:12,990
She felt so much better that after this holiday in Tenerife there were problems again

249
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:20,550
and these problems she told you about in May and you gave her Pulsatilla for this problem.

250
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:28,020
But the problems came back, the distention was much more worse than before

251
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,380
after this holiday in Tenerife.

252
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:45,170
-I see. So don't go to Spain. Twice you went to Spain and you got it.

253
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,670
So conclusion, don't go to Spain again.

254
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:18,490
What I think is that happens here is that there is some kind of a deeper pathology

255
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:28,990
which is aggravated by a certain situation and now the whole story came out that

256
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:38,430
she most probably ate some food which upset the digestion and then she started again.

257
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,510
That's interesting.

258
00:35:50,760 --> 00:36:03,410
When the aggravation comes from 2 sources, mostly green vegetables and milk and

259
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:13,400
there is distention because of such food, there is a possibility of having amoebiasis.

260
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:31,580
You know what amoeba is? What is the German word?

261
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:41,080
Amöbe, I got it!

262
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:55,810
This comes together with some pain. Usually there are little pains

263
00:36:55,910 --> 00:37:03,600
which are going on together with distention, if they eat green stuff, fruits, green stuff

264
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:09,150
and milk are no good for this type of problem.

265
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:19,310
This type of problem is a severe and insisting little bugs which they stay into the body

266
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:31,060
and nobody can get rid of them ever. It can be reduced to a considerable degree with Homeopathy

267
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:41,500
but you will not really get them out, especially if there are many years of standing there.

268
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:51,250
And I wonder if she has not been examined ever for this disease. No.

269
00:37:52,500 --> 00:38:01,150
The second possibility which is a syndrome, called malabsorption syndrome,

270
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:15,390
it is a symptom in which gluten is not tolerated and creates a lot of similar problems,

271
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:18,070
the ones that she is talking about.

272
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:41,570
I think the other name is, if I remember well, it is called Coeliace [celiac]  sprue.

273
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:26,220
The symptoms that she relates and the type of food which aggravate her indicates

274
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,720
either the one or the other.

275
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:38,470
Both of these conditions are conditions which are quite insistent I would say

276
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,640
and we have to be a little bit patient.

277
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:57,720
Now unfortunately the situation was aggravated as it appears to be in Spain

278
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:00,150
and what shall we do?

279
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:09,550
-It has the distention yet but in almost all cases it goes together with diarrhea

280
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:11,390
and not with constipation.

281
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:19,300
The patients are emaciated due to this massive diarrheas that sometimes are like explosions.

282
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:35,130
-Maybe what happens here is not a typical or a severe case of Coeliace sprue

283
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:41,710
but this can be quite a severe case, intolerance of gluten.

284
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:54,800
-The last years they found out that there is constipation too, constipation and tightness,

285
00:40:54,900 --> 00:41:00,390
so it is not right. It's new.

286
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:12,630
-As far as I remember, there is not so much the syndrome in the diarrhea

287
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:25,380
but malabsorption syndrome means a general bad condition, it is like eating poison

288
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:31,310
when you take food which contains gluten.

289
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:41,380
I don't say it is the mal absorption syndrome, neither I say it is amoebiasis

290
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:51,880
but what I say is we have to examine these 2 possibilities, in which case we have to be

291
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:58,380
a little bit patient in waiting to see the effect of the remedy

292
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,210
and not expecting immediate results.

293
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:10,810
Because both of these cases are cases which are insistent, they are hard to treat.

294
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:18,030
What she says is when she eats certain food, which she used to eat certain food,

295
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:25,470
she has this type of stool, which she described several times.

296
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:32,040
-I didn't get what she said but I will mention something.

297
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:51,870
I've been to Spain one time 6 weeks and before I go I get the gamma globulin injection.

298
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:55,370
-Where?
-In Norway.

299
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:59,130
-Wait a moment, you get the gamma globulin now this summer?

300
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:17,870
-No, many years ago. I think 12 years ago but for 3 weeks I was so good after gamma globulin,

301
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:32,970
I was very good. Go to toilet every day, distention, everything was good.

302
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:44,780
And [doctor's name] she has a machine and some years ago she tested something like amoeba,

303
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,220
I don't remember, I have the paper at home.

304
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:59,400
-But you have been suffering for years with this problem, so how is that you knew

305
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:06,800
about the Coeliace sprue? How did you know? Your doctors suspected?

306
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:16,050
-Coeliace intolerance they suspected but not sure.

307
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:37,950
-It is not a severe case, if it is a case like that but now we go to the treatment,

308
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:41,300
what shall we do? Who says wait?

309
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:53,300
Who says give a remedy? Who says give Lycopodium?

310
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,800
Which remedy, this is the problem.

311
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:10,450
Those who put up their hands, do you know which remedy?

312
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:13,200
I want them to tell me which is the remedy.

313
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:16,460
-We know you know.
-I know?

314
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:24,960
Who wants to give a remedy and what remedy?

315
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:30,620
-My understanding, maybe I misunderstood, was that the last remedy she received was Silica

316
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:35,260
and not Pulsatilla, right?
-Yes correct.

317
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:39,110
-And I understood, maybe I misunderstood, that she is not feeling well,

318
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:47,950
she complains every day now.
-She has distention and constipation every day.

319
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:51,280
-And with China she felt better, she said.

320
00:45:51,380 --> 00:46:03,780
-She felt better all around but she went to holidays and then she got bloated again

321
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:10,030
and then we prescribed Pulsatilla, for which she described how she felt.

322
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:18,030
At this moment she feels very well, as far as coughing is concerned, and her mental-emotional state

323
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:33,110
is quite good.She has a physical complain, which is constipation and also bloatedness.

324
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:43,360
Is the bloatedness severe? She was not able to confirm that it is severe.

325
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:52,300
She says it's every day but I did not get the impression it is really severe bloatedness.

326
00:46:54,500 --> 00:47:03,340
-You can't go like that she said. It's terrible. When it's worse it's really worse

327
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,530
and he can't understand why I can bloat so much.

328
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:09,210
-He is a doctor?

329
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:18,180
-No he is not a doctor, I try to eat carefully and then this bloatedness in the evening.

330
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:28,020
I can't have usual trousers, I have to have a jogging and... so it is worse.

331
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:40,760
-I would like to say that this is severe because when I see her in the evening,

332
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:50,120
she looks pregnant and this is not what she looks in the morning, so it's much worse in the evening.

333
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:52,510
-She did not say that.

334
00:47:52,610 --> 00:48:03,760
-No and she is very tender, it's like she can't have any clothes on that is tight, not at all.

335
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:11,360
She can't stand tight clothes around this bloated abdomen, so I think it's severe.

336
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:22,010
-And definitely she confirms that in the evening is much worse. What time is the worse time for you,

337
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:31,610
I want to ask you.
-After 8 maybe, 7-8.

338
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:45,360
-I like to add something more. I also think that her tiredness is very special.

339
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:51,260
We can sit and work together and suddenly she can't take it anymore.

340
00:48:51,360 --> 00:49:06,010
She has to lay down, relax a little and in the evening she is very tired but she can stay awake

341
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:07,690
and this I think it's special.

342
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:14,520
-What is the remedy?

343
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:25,680
-I don't know but I know her for a while and I think after the got the China

344
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:30,530
something else started to happen, very, very positive.

345
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:40,930
I think that she is-not only in the physical state but also in the mental state-

346
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:49,760
she is not that confused anymore, she is more clear and the tightness is still there

347
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:53,860
but something positive happened with her.

348
00:49:54,360 --> 00:50:06,510
And she is much more happy, much more alive and I think we all agree on that and her distention too

349
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:15,510
was much better and the cough was totally gone and when we spoke with her she was very happy.

350
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:22,010
And of course this was at the same time that she got this new boyfriend and everything in her life

351
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:31,090
was getting better, so we don't know exactly if it was the remedy or if it was the situation,

352
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:32,340
we don't know.

353
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:40,110
But we experience that the time of the China was a very good time for her.

354
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:47,840
After this trip to Tenerife she told me on the telephone many times, I don't get well again

355
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:51,400
after this happening in Tenerife.

356
00:50:53,640 --> 00:51:00,510
-I was better from China before that last boyfriend. I met him after.

357
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:11,880
I start getting better, we went on vacation together in Cyprus and I started getting better

358
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:18,580
but I stopped gluten, I stopped eating bread at the same time, as I told you.

359
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:25,800
I was so good for half a year, very good, nearly every day I would go to the toilet,

360
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:28,820
no distention, it was perfect.

361
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:45,400
-Do you have the original case? Can you show the original symptomatology?

362
00:51:50,400 --> 00:52:11,130
Stool bloody, she had bloody stool also. Also sleeplessness. Sadness on waking in the morning,

363
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:12,930
chill after anger.

364
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:21,180
-Yes but the bloody stool was not often. But this summer I had it 2 times again.

365
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:42,900
-No other symptoms. Sweets aggravates, desire for company, desire for traveling, hurry.

366
00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:56,550
Show me what symptoms China was covering. Coughing...

367
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:18,860
Stool bloody, flatulence... This acute smell you still have it?

368
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:35,280
-Very little, I can be sensitive very seldom to tobacco smoke but perfumes and strong odors

369
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:37,130
is much better.

370
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:55,380
-Do you eat fruits now?
-I try to eat some fruits.

371
00:53:55,850 --> 00:54:03,700
-And it does not give you this intense flatulence that it gave you?

372
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:17,700
-Not flatulence, never flatulence, only distention. Very seldom flatulence,

373
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:20,950
maybe when I eat something special that I don't know.

374
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:23,200
-So actually you don't have flatulence.

375
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:33,950
-No, sometimes maybe in the evening but not amelioration, very little amelioration.

376
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:40,550
In the evening if I lay down in bed, maybe a little bit, very seldom.

377
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:56,360
-Last time we had a keynote of Medorrhinum and I was just wondering what happened on it.

378
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:57,610
-Sleeping on abdomen?

379
00:54:57,710 --> 00:55:02,870
-No, leaning back for stool, I wonder what happened to that.

380
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:06,700
-Leaning backwards when she has to pass stool.

381
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:17,690
-If I had urging, it helps to do that. That's quite strong.

382
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:25,540
-Show me this rubric. Only Medorrhinum.

383
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:39,790
You like sour fruits, unripe fruits?

384
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:49,520
-Very much before, when I was a child I was only eating sour fruits, fruits that

385
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:58,120
were not ready at all and if I eat an orange, I need to eat 9 more.

386
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:02,120
-If you started eating.

387
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:06,070
-So I asked my mother if I could have the whole pack.

388
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:10,790
-She would never put it all in front of you.

389
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:26,870
-I just had Medorrhinum once.

390
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:31,520
-Was any effect?

391
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:41,300
-It was 10M and after I had very stiff legs, walking upstairs very stiff legs.

392
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:49,370
I don't remember so much because the homeopath changed the remedy after a month.

393
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:54,620
-You still sleep on your abdomen?
-Yes.

394
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:02,540
-And you are better in the sea.

395
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:14,540
-I'm so tired with Medorrhinum, in the evening but maybe it's the opposite, I don't know.

396
00:57:21,290 --> 00:57:36,540
-She had gonorrhea. When you got the Medorrhinum what year it was?

397
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,790
-I think 5,6 years ago.

398
00:57:56,250 --> 00:58:07,550
-There are 2 possibilities according to me for the new remedies.

399
00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:20,950
The one is Medorrhinum and the other is Lycopodium. My question is shall we repeat China

400
00:58:21,050 --> 00:58:29,200
or shall we go to 1 or the 2 remedies which is Medorrhinum first

401
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:32,880
or Lycopodium second possibility?

402
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:48,140
-I intend to ask you but I didn't. Why didn't you give me China higher because I think about it myself.

403
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,130
I wonder but I didn't ask you.

404
00:58:55,370 --> 00:59:05,860
-For me there was no anymore the China sensitivity and irritability

405
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:11,210
and the whole nervous system which you presented the first time.

406
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:18,360
If I show you the first interview together with this interview, you will see a tremendous difference

407
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:21,860
in the presentation.

408
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:30,790
The one was really the nervous system really in a state of great stress and excitement.

409
00:59:31,790 --> 00:59:40,690
I didn't see this, then most probably you told me there was less desire for sweets and

410
00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:45,790
different other things which are changed, now I can't remember.

411
00:59:49,790 --> 00:59:52,040
-I never had desire for sweets.

412
00:59:57,490 --> 01:00:06,040
-Most probably you did not give me the keynotes of China.

413
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:14,630
-Loss of fluid.

414
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:23,870
-Yes but in the first interview you have said that sometimes you had bloody stool.

415
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:32,520
-I think it was just for some days, maybe it's my English. She said something more,

416
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:41,370
I said it in there now but she said maybe I didn't say it clear enough. I had to eat quite often.

417
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:54,340
I have to eat every 4 hours, I prefer to eat after 3 hours but I try to wait 1 more hour.

418
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:56,940
If I don't eat, I get so tired.

419
01:00:58,950 --> 01:01:05,590
I had done that as long as I can remember and I had to eat regular food,

420
01:01:05,690 --> 01:01:09,940
no cakes, no sweets, real food.

421
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:11,810
-And very frequently.

422
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:21,560
-Yes real food, some protein with food the same with my aunt it's like that.

423
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:31,910
It's always the same, he had to eat regularly but they had not the other trouble I have.

424
01:01:39,910 --> 01:01:48,060
-If I remember you had taken before Lycopodium and you felt good on Lycopodium.

425
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,530
Is that correct?

426
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:57,490
-Yes I was better but it was definitely that the China took the cough.

427
01:01:59,690 --> 01:02:02,060
I took it by myself the first time.

428
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:07,310
-As we have said we prescribe a remedy after a remedy.

429
01:02:07,410 --> 01:02:12,240
So the first remedy you should have taken it was China.

430
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,900
Now we are trying to find the second remedy.

431
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:24,980
The second remedy was Pulsatilla but I do not understand whether Pulsatilla has acted or not.

432
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:34,480
The way that you describe as if it gave you only an aggravation without amelioration.

433
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:39,230
-That stayed too long I think.

434
01:02:39,330 --> 01:02:52,480
-So I'm not sure but on the other hand I see your psychological state is quite good.

435
01:02:52,580 --> 01:03:00,150
I don't know whether this is because of Pulsatilla or for what?

436
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:10,890
Still you had your boyfriend last May, no big change from May until today, I see in your face

437
01:03:10,990 --> 01:03:12,730
there are certain signs.

438
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:20,580
I will teach you some physiognomy, some signs.

439
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:29,760
When a person is satisfied and she has this sign, she has the sign of a person

440
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:38,260
who is finally satisfied and there is no satisfaction, there is an inner peace.

441
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:52,610
We have to show to see it if you can see it on the video because it is a very little sign on the lids.

442
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:59,110
The lids become relaxed and they open a little bit more.

443
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:13,030
I don't know if I can show you this sign on video.

444
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:28,930
Her lower lids are relaxed and they are more open. Now that for me together with the

445
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:45,680
quality of the skin, the skin takes a juicy quality, it's not dry. It's very difficult to describe

446
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:55,280
but this is juicy. Juicy means not dry.

447
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:09,680
Your organism is better, so your report says I was aggravated by Pulsatilla.

448
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:16,680
My observation says she is better but anyhow, it doesn't matter.

449
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:27,930
Now we're dealing with your situation and we decide that you take a dose of Medorrhinum again,

450
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:39,110
but not too high, just 200, Medorrhinum 200.

451
01:05:59,610 --> 01:06:02,360
Let me ask you one more question.

452
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:14,770
You remember you had this reaction after the remedy where you lie down inside?

453
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:24,760
You were present together with her. We two managed to calm her down,

454
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:34,610
was it after China this reaction?
-The same day.

455
01:06:35,110 --> 01:06:44,010
-You have not seen this reaction and it is interesting that you get some information

456
01:06:44,110 --> 01:06:55,260
where she was really feeling bad psychologically. I would like you to describe

457
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:59,110
because you were in the same room with me.

458
01:07:01,610 --> 01:07:02,950
-I was there.

459
01:07:09,450 --> 01:07:17,850
-So you will see the reaction and don't get panicky after the reactions of the homeopathic remedy.

460
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:26,350
She was lying down there and she was in a terrible state and if you lose your heart,

461
01:07:26,450 --> 01:07:29,700
you start giving different remedies to bring her back.

462
01:07:31,530 --> 01:07:35,760
You should describe as dramatic as it was the case.

463
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:45,860
Don't try to be a Norwegian but rather a Greek describing a Norwegian case.

464
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:56,080
-Well I can make a try. Just some minutes after she took the remedy, she had this reaction.

465
01:07:56,180 --> 01:08:04,830
Very fast after she took the remedy. She had to go out from the class and I went after

466
01:08:04,930 --> 01:08:11,830
and she was nearly collapsing and she would lie down on the bench in your office

467
01:08:11,930 --> 01:08:18,160
and on her stomach and she started to cry, really cry.

468
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:19,410
-She couldn't stop.

469
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:25,160
-She couldn't stop and it was like her body was trembling really.

470
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:39,410
I don't know the expression in English, shaking, a deep cry like something was coming out.

471
01:08:40,510 --> 01:08:45,010
Sobbing, OK thank you.

472
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:56,000
And after Roger came I remember and he drove with his car back to the place where we stayed

473
01:08:56,100 --> 01:09:02,240
and after a little while she got much better.

474
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:11,990
It was like can this happen? She was so bad but after half an hour maybe,

475
01:09:12,090 --> 01:09:15,740
she was much, much better and we could communicate.

476
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:24,740
-Not half an hour because half an hour I was with her trying to hold her

477
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:32,740
because it was really coming out from very deep all the grief, I would say all the grief

478
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:34,990
she had been all the years.

479
01:09:35,090 --> 01:09:43,260
It was coming out in that particular hour, it was 1 hour, 1 and a half hour.

480
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:49,010
Half an hour after you returned...

481
01:09:50,790 --> 01:09:56,910
-Let's say 2 hours after she took the remedy she was much better again

482
01:09:57,010 --> 01:10:04,990
and then we  went on the beach and she was sleeping on this beach for some hours.

483
01:10:05,090 --> 01:10:13,580
She did not communicate with us, she was lying there, sleeping but it was very cool,

484
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:21,680
very normal, very good, everything but she felt much better the same evening after China.

485
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:27,580
Can I add something more?
-Yes.

486
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:35,420
-We went before China in the mountain in Norway together, just me and her,

487
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,590
we were walking in the mountain.

488
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:47,580
On this trip she has a reaction, she had something emotional coming up, it was after she had

489
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:59,610
an accident with her knee but this accident led to that we had to sit down. We had to sit down,

490
01:10:59,710 --> 01:11:06,080
we couldn't walk anymore, we had to relax and I don't know what was happening

491
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:14,280
but she was very angry, she was very angry with everything that was happening in her life,

492
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:16,090
before years ago.

493
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:26,830
I remember she was throwing stones, it was nobody there, just us, so don't misunderstand it

494
01:11:26,930 --> 01:11:33,550
was just fine, it was not a crazy thing to do, it was OK but she was throwing stones

495
01:11:33,650 --> 01:11:43,990
and she was very angry and she told about several things back in her past and I think after China

496
01:11:44,090 --> 01:11:54,000
I haven't seen this anger anymore, it's gone. So something must have happened with China.

497
01:11:54,450 --> 01:12:05,070
-Anyhow what is important is when you give a remedy and you will have this kind of reactions,

498
01:12:05,170 --> 01:12:14,550
to never interfere with that reaction, don't try to stop such reaction.

499
01:12:14,650 --> 01:12:22,220
Don't get panicky because such reactions are always curative and never dangerous,

500
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:34,720
especially if they concern emotional crisis. We all have kept a lot of emotional traumas.

501
01:12:35,570 --> 01:12:44,970
Different reasons for each one of us and when the remedy hits really deep these traumas

502
01:12:45,070 --> 01:12:47,220
they become conscious.

503
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:58,140
You become conscious in way, they come up to the memory and you relieve all that.

504
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:07,380
And this is a very good catharsis, a very good process in clearing up all these dramas

505
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:17,320
which stayed inside and if you give a remedy at the moment, even if you think there are

506
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:22,720
dangerous symptoms, don't stop the reaction.

507
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:29,690
It is absolutely necessary for this to happen.

508
01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:37,420
-How much time is allowed to pass between taking the remedy and such a reaction.

509
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:43,470
I mean if it happens a couple of minutes after somebody takes the remedy it's clear but

510
01:13:43,570 --> 01:13:47,530
what if such a reaction takes place maybe 2 or 3 weeks after taking the remedy,

511
01:13:47,630 --> 01:13:49,530
is it still OK then?

512
01:13:49,630 --> 01:14:01,030
-Still OK, if the reaction is on an emotional level it is OK because it maybe a slow process

513
01:14:01,130 --> 01:14:17,790
and then you have this outlet which is a big catharsis and the important thing is that after

514
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:23,880
this crisis the person must feel much better.

515
01:14:24,830 --> 01:14:34,780
Don't confuse it with a hysterical reaction which may happen during the taking of the remedy,

516
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:36,360
this is different.

517
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:43,450
If a person has a hysterical reaction after your remedy, it doesn't mean it is a curative

518
01:14:43,550 --> 01:14:50,200
reaction. The curative reaction where you will see that after this crisis,

519
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:58,050
the person feels much better. Then you say, this was a curative process.

520
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:09,130
-Does that also counts of the patients afterwards developing a severe depression?

521
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:20,530
-It depends what? She is suffering with a depression already? You are talking about a case?

522
01:15:20,630 --> 01:15:27,880
You have a case of depression or no depression, you give the remedy and she has depression?

523
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:33,950
You give the remedy and she has depression and she was not suffering before with depression.

524
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:51,010
Only in the case that you have personality disorders or you have a case of fixed ideas

525
01:15:51,110 --> 01:16:02,010
or you have a case mentally quite disturbed. You go to depression yes.

526
01:16:02,110 --> 01:16:12,020
Once the mental is more clear and more understanding, then this is a curative reaction.

527
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:23,020
We have that also in psychiatry. In psychiatry, those experienced in psychiatry afraid

528
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:30,760
the time that the person feels better in his mental confusion.

529
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:36,520
When he comes out of the mental confusions many times they are afraid of suicide

530
01:16:36,620 --> 01:16:48,510
because the person goes into depression and the remedies have acted, even the psychotropic drugs

531
01:16:48,610 --> 01:16:56,760
have acted correctly, bringing down the mental confusion into depression.

532
01:17:00,190 --> 01:17:04,840
But they are afraid during that time that the person may commit suicide.

533
01:17:04,940 --> 01:17:14,360
The moment they realize this, they go into depression and they can commit suicide.

534
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:16,940
-I have to add something to that question.

535
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:22,430
If it is a patient who had had a depression, maybe 3 years ago and now he receives the remedy

536
01:17:22,530 --> 01:17:28,760
and after 1 week he goes back into that depression, is that still a curative reaction?

537
01:17:28,860 --> 01:17:38,510
-It is a curative reaction in case of a cancer. You have a cancer of uterus, you treat.

538
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:51,420
And the cancer it is the result of a depression 10 years before, there was a breaking down

539
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:59,170
of a strong relation and the woman going into depression and from depression

540
01:17:59,270 --> 01:18:01,920
develops cancer of the uterus.

541
01:18:02,020 --> 01:18:09,010
Now you treat cancer of the uterus and she is doing well, she will go back to relive the state

542
01:18:09,110 --> 01:18:11,440
in which she was before.

543
01:18:15,490 --> 01:18:23,890
I went back to Harrison and I read a little bit the syndrome we had been discussing,

544
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:43,890
the Coeliace sprue for the case of the Norwegian lady and it is true that we can have this condition

545
01:18:43,990 --> 01:18:53,810
without the diarrhea. But in this case what I said, it might be that syndrome.

546
01:18:53,910 --> 01:19:09,810
Why? Because if you remember when she was eating gluten containing foods, she had a reaction

547
01:19:09,910 --> 01:19:15,810
and when she took it out of her diet, she did better.

548
01:19:15,910 --> 01:19:29,810
This is a typical diagnostic about this syndrome. What happens now there is no the diarrhea.

549
01:19:29,910 --> 01:19:36,310
That means it's improving, the syndrome is improving because the diarrhea was before.

550
01:19:40,690 --> 01:19:49,760
She said, if I eat these opposite foods then I will have a stool.

551
01:19:58,070 --> 01:20:05,720
But this case also is interesting from another point of view which I think I have

552
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:13,910
to point out to you that there were...

553
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:28,660
In her case it is this kind of things. You have China and there is Pulsatilla

554
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:47,490
and there is Medorrhinum but you see the Medorrhinum symptoms were from the very beginning.

555
01:20:48,990 --> 01:20:53,610
The Medorrhinum symptoms from the fact that she got gonorrhea etc.

556
01:20:53,710 --> 01:21:02,560
Yet we choose the China as the first prescription. Now what happens is that then what belongs

557
01:21:02,660 --> 01:21:06,910
to the Pulsatilla symptomatology, it remained.

558
01:21:07,660 --> 01:21:15,030
The China symptom went away and the Pulsatilla with the Medorrhinum symptoms remained.

559
01:21:15,130 --> 01:21:23,030
Then you give Pulsatilla, then this layer goes and then the Medorrhinum layer remains

560
01:21:23,130 --> 01:21:29,780
and if you give the Medorrhinum now after China and Pulsatilla,

561
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:33,630
now most probably the Medorrhinum will act.

562
01:21:34,130 --> 01:21:44,720
Where previously she had taken Medorrhinum and there was only a little aggravation in the feet.

563
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:53,200
This is the difficulty with this confused case because what is this?

564
01:21:53,300 --> 01:22:04,530
How can you read this? It is confused but still there are guiding symptoms

565
01:22:04,630 --> 01:22:13,130
and the guiding symptoms are the ones that are keynotes for the case.

566
01:22:13,630 --> 01:22:24,330
Also it is interesting what her friend remarked. Why you didn't give a China again?

567
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:32,980
Why didn't I give? Why I did not consider a China again?

568
01:22:37,210 --> 01:22:43,730
It is better if we make an experiment, so you realize in actual practice what happens.

569
01:22:47,220 --> 01:22:57,200
You have a case, there is an aggravation, then there is an amelioration, then there is starting

570
01:22:57,300 --> 01:23:12,800
a relapse here. What you will do? Wait? You better wait.

571
01:23:16,830 --> 01:23:21,580
It's a complete relapse but what do we mean by complete relapse?

572
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:31,530
All the symptoms, OK. I will give you an example so you understand what do we mean

573
01:23:31,630 --> 01:23:39,780
when we say relapse because this is the teaching and I presume that you understand the teaching.

574
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:49,870
Now I will give you an example to realize that here you have to wait,

575
01:23:49,970 --> 01:23:57,610
most probably you have to wait but there are conditions on which you can prescribe.

576
01:23:59,220 --> 01:24:00,960
The same remedy.

577
01:24:02,970 --> 01:24:08,970
What are the conditions? I will give you a case. You write down.

578
01:24:09,970 --> 01:24:26,380
There is a case with asthma which is worse, the asthmatic attack is worse during the night,

579
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:31,880
without a specific time.

580
01:24:32,830 --> 01:24:39,380
It can be in the beginning of the sleep, it can be later, it can be towards the morning.

581
01:24:40,130 --> 01:24:41,630
What is the remedy?

582
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:57,860
You see, you say I can't make a decision. Then you continue to ask the patient

583
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:11,110
and you say do you have some modalities? Yes, when I cough, then I bring up sputum and

584
01:25:11,210 --> 01:25:18,720
coughing up sputum makes the coughing and the asthma better. What is the remedy?

585
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:22,830
Can anybody tell the remedy?

586
01:25:29,050 --> 01:25:32,460
With these 2 symptoms can you tell the remedy? Can you be sure for the remedy?

587
01:25:33,250 --> 01:25:34,610
-No.

588
01:25:34,710 --> 01:25:38,220
-No, who can prescribe on this? Nobody.

589
01:25:39,210 --> 01:25:45,130
You can tell any remedy Sambucus nigra and Natrum sulph and Kalis, everything.

590
01:25:47,630 --> 01:26:04,030
Then you ask for more modalities and he says that I can not sleep in a position which is flat.

591
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:11,640
I have to have 3-4 pillows for the night, which is the remedy?

592
01:26:14,650 --> 01:26:19,030
Kali carbonicum, Pulsatilla, Arsenicum... which is the remedy?

593
01:26:19,130 --> 01:26:22,890
You don't know the remedy, correct?

594
01:26:29,140 --> 01:26:43,120
Then you ask further information and she says that the asthma is better in the open air.

595
01:26:45,870 --> 01:26:52,610
What is the remedy?
-Pulsatilla.

596
01:26:52,710 --> 01:26:55,710
-Pulsatilla, are you sure?
-No.

597
01:26:56,200 --> 01:27:02,600
-And then you think of Pulsatilla and then you ask do you feel cold or do you feel hot?

598
01:27:02,700 --> 01:27:09,370
And says my god I'm very cold. What is the remedy?

599
01:27:13,620 --> 01:27:21,540
Who dares say the remedy is going to take a chance, you don't know the remedy yet.

600
01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:34,120
Then you proceed and you ask a bit more information. Are you thirsty? Yes, I'm thirsty.

601
01:27:34,870 --> 01:27:41,940
Are you thirsty for cold or for warm? For big quantities? Big quantities. For cold or warm?

602
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:49,690
For cold. Thirsty for big quantities for cold, what is the remedy?

603
01:27:49,790 --> 01:27:51,220
-Phosphorus.

604
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:56,540
-Phosphorus, are you sure? No.

605
01:28:00,450 --> 01:28:15,620
Then you are examining more the case and you say, do you have any fears?

606
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:26,200
Yes, I'm afraid of dying, fear of death. Which is the remedy?

607
01:28:33,950 --> 01:28:54,190
You don't know the remedy. Then you investigate further and you discover that she is a person

608
01:28:54,290 --> 01:29:05,220
who is very cold really, she covers herself with 3 blankets even in summer but

609
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:20,290
she says the head is hot, my head is hot, my body is cold but my head is hot.

610
01:29:26,540 --> 01:29:34,440
I need freshair in my head actually where my body is very cold.

611
01:29:36,690 --> 01:29:41,020
What you suspect mostly will be the remedy?

612
01:29:43,190 --> 01:29:53,270
You start suspecting that the remedy is Arsenicum. You say, are you by chance restless?

613
01:29:54,520 --> 01:30:02,000
And the patient says, I'm tremendously restless, I can't stay in one place, I have to get up

614
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:07,500
and go there and I'm exhausted and still I have to get up and change the place

615
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:12,350
and go from place to place, what is the remedy?

616
01:30:19,350 --> 01:30:22,940
-Arsenicum.
-You confirm now Arsenicum.

617
01:30:37,850 --> 01:30:42,190
-Better in open air, Arsenicum is not better in open air. It's strong.

618
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:59,250
-Yes it's strong but this is the case where you have to start with a remedy with these symptoms.

619
01:30:59,350 --> 01:31:08,350
I told you, which remedy you will start, tell me. Which is the remedy with these symptoms so far?

620
01:31:09,140 --> 01:31:19,100
When  the person is very cold but the head is hot, is warm and needs air, fanning,

621
01:31:19,850 --> 01:31:32,500
when there is great thirst, when there is restlessness and exhaustion, when needs to sit up

622
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:39,850
with 3 pillows, can not go down, which is the remedy?

623
01:31:40,850 --> 01:31:53,750
All these symptoms, fear of death, these symptoms now become symptoms of Arsenicum.

624
01:31:56,110 --> 01:32:04,100
OK, to make it more clear I changed the thirst from cold but in sips.

625
01:32:07,860 --> 01:32:21,090
You have thirst which is frequent in sips, which is the remedy? Arsenicum.

626
01:32:22,130 --> 01:32:29,610
Now you give Arsenicum and this happens, there is an aggravation, there is an amelioration

627
01:32:29,710 --> 01:32:36,950
and after some time it starts a relapse.

628
01:32:37,050 --> 01:32:49,450
Now the persons comes back and he says I started again having dyspnea and coughing, when?

629
01:32:52,800 --> 01:33:06,690
Mostly I started in the early morning hours but also during the night from time to time

630
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:13,300
I have some dyspnea, I cough, I have some mucus, then I go back.

631
01:33:28,710 --> 01:33:34,360
I'll take several possibilities. The one possibility is, she tells now,

632
01:33:34,460 --> 01:33:40,960
the modalities of the asthma, a little bit different.

633
01:33:42,470 --> 01:33:59,600
She still needs to prop up, she starts needing to put up her head in the night with 3 pillows

634
01:33:59,700 --> 01:34:07,190
where before during this amelioration period, she was sleeping without 3 pillows,

635
01:34:07,290 --> 01:34:12,790
she was sleeping with 1 pillow. Now she starts putting up the pillows again.

636
01:34:15,530 --> 01:34:29,120
Are you going to give the remedy? Are you allowed to give the remedy?

637
01:34:30,620 --> 01:34:31,350
-No.

638
01:34:31,450 --> 01:34:42,190
-You are not allowed to give the remedy. Now you investigate and you say that

639
01:34:42,290 --> 01:34:45,540
how is your coldness in the body?

640
01:34:46,570 --> 01:34:57,700
Coldness in the body starts again where it was quite normal now I start feeling the cold again,

641
01:34:59,790 --> 01:35:04,440
are you going to give the remedy?
-No.

642
01:35:04,540 --> 01:35:17,880
-No. How is your fear of death? Fear of death is gone actually,

643
01:35:18,620 --> 01:35:25,520
are you going to give the remedy?
-No.

644
01:35:25,620 --> 01:35:33,270
-No, do we agree? You must not give the remedy, it's not shall I give or shall I not, you

645
01:35:33,370 --> 01:35:40,270
must not give the remedy at this moment of the investigation and let us say now, you

646
01:35:40,370 --> 01:35:46,620
continue the investigation and you say, what about the thirst?

647
01:35:49,880 --> 01:36:01,520
She says, my thirst was reduced, I did not have to take all the time sips of water but since

648
01:36:01,620 --> 01:36:11,570
15 days I'm starting again taking sips of water, are you going to give the remedy?

649
01:36:12,780 --> 01:36:15,290
Who is going to give the remedy at that stage?

650
01:36:22,530 --> 01:36:30,040
Then you still investigate and you say that what about restlessness?

651
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:36,880
Since 2 weeks restlessness has started.

652
01:36:43,150 --> 01:36:48,620
Do you remember when you started thinking of Arsenicum?

653
01:36:49,620 --> 01:36:55,770
That moment when you started thinking of Arsenicum till the moment you confirmed Arsenicum

654
01:36:55,870 --> 01:37:08,200
by several keynotes is the crucial points in which we call complete return of the case.

655
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:17,760
The asthma is not the return of the case. The return of the case, in order to prescribe,

656
01:37:17,860 --> 01:37:21,940
are the keynotes on which you base your prescription.

657
01:37:22,940 --> 01:37:30,090
If the keynotes, on which you based your initial prescriptions, are back even here

658
01:37:30,190 --> 01:37:39,980
you can prescribe the remedy but even here you can not prescribe if the person says,

659
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:49,070
yes I have sips of water but I don't have the restlessness and then you ask,

660
01:37:50,170 --> 01:37:53,820
did you start having some bloatedness? Oh yes.

661
01:37:53,920 --> 01:38:01,250
What time do you have the bloatedness? In the afternoon, 4,5,6,8.

662
01:38:05,500 --> 01:38:12,650
So therefore under the Arsenicum was Lycopodium and in spite of the fact

663
01:38:12,750 --> 01:38:19,650
you have some keynotes but you don't have all the keynotes.

664
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:27,650
In the first case, in spite of the fact one keynote is missing, like fear of death is missing,

665
01:38:27,750 --> 01:38:35,400
still there are enough keynotes, can not lie flat one keynote, second keynote thirst

666
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:47,230
for sips of water, third keynote coldness of the body, fourth keynote restlessness with exhaustion.

667
01:38:47,330 --> 01:38:50,830
You can give it, you can give it even here.

668
01:38:52,580 --> 01:38:59,740
When you don't have a full relapse because the asthma is not so bad, it only comes towards

669
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:10,080
the morning hours and sometimes comes but the keynotes are back.

670
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:16,570
The keynotes on which you prescribe, you are allowed to prescribe the remedy here.

671
01:39:16,670 --> 01:39:25,100
But you have to be careful because some keynotes they belong to 2,3,5 or 10 remedies.

672
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:33,400
So if you are not careful, you are going to repeat the remedy with one keynote,

673
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:37,500
thirst for sips of water, good OK.

674
01:39:38,750 --> 01:39:45,400
But the coldness is not so much, then there is bloatedness, then the aggravation is

675
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:56,400
in the afternoon, it has changed the picture and that means you have to prescribe

676
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:59,500
the second remedy, not the first.

677
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:14,400
And in her case like in every case which is difficult case, it's a case which is confused,

678
01:40:14,500 --> 01:40:20,410
it's a case when we say difficult case it's from many points of view, it's not only pathology.

679
01:40:20,510 --> 01:40:32,900
A difficult case can become a case of mild symptomatology, I just feel this and that,

680
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:42,650
let me go to Homeopathy because sometimes I feel tired and I get a little headache

681
01:40:42,750 --> 01:40:46,650
and sometimes this and sometimes that, little symptomatology.

682
01:40:46,750 --> 01:40:55,980
You go there, you can not find the remedy and you start prescribing different remedies. You see?

683
01:40:56,080 --> 01:41:02,830
A change of symptoms only. Not a progress in the case.

684
01:41:08,830 --> 01:41:28,320
So in this case it is important to observe how the Medorrhinum symptoms remained constant,

685
01:41:28,420 --> 01:41:35,320
the underneath symptoms remained constant and there is a time when we will need Medorrhinum

686
01:41:35,420 --> 01:41:36,670
but not yet.

687
01:41:38,670 --> 01:41:47,580
Perhaps now its' the time, we never know unless we see the reaction of the case,

688
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:51,670
we never know if the remedy we prescribed is correct.

689
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:58,150
Especially in cases that are confused but I can tell you I have seen cases where they look

690
01:41:58,250 --> 01:42:05,650
absolutely like Natrum muriaticum. You give Nat mur and doesn't act at all.

691
01:42:07,330 --> 01:42:13,230
So even if you think the case is clear, the remedy may not act,

692
01:42:13,330 --> 01:42:22,980
maybe missing something in the case, which if you put it together, like if missing the bloatedness.

693
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:27,980
You forgot to ask about the bloatedness and the time of aggravation, you miss this

694
01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:31,830
and you prescribe different other remedies instead of Lycopodium.

695
01:42:36,830 --> 01:42:43,730
-In the past I've been told and I think you told this that when you give a remedy and there is

696
01:42:43,830 --> 01:42:50,480
a good reaction, the patient improves but then after a time the patient gets worse again

697
01:42:50,580 --> 01:42:54,230
that this is a good reaction of the first remedy and the first thing that you should do

698
01:42:54,330 --> 01:42:56,230
is to repeat the first remedy.

699
01:42:56,330 --> 01:43:03,980
-This is what I meant. Now I explain because there was a misunderstanding between.

700
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:17,230
This is what I said. When the case is relapsing, you can give the remedy in case there is

701
01:43:17,330 --> 01:43:18,480
a full relapse.

702
01:43:18,580 --> 01:43:29,770
I call it a full relapse. A full relapse, I explain, it might be that the pathology might be different

703
01:43:29,870 --> 01:43:34,510
but the keynotes on which you prescribed initially are back.

704
01:43:34,610 --> 01:43:39,770
This is what you are interested in order to repeat the remedy, a full relapse I mean

705
01:43:39,870 --> 01:43:47,180
actually the coming back of the keynotes on which you prescribed originally.

706
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:57,430
But you have to be careful because in headaches, you have to have the experience

707
01:43:57,530 --> 01:43:59,070
to understand what I say.

708
01:44:00,210 --> 01:44:08,600
A case of severe migraines, you have started treatment of she has taken treatment

709
01:44:08,700 --> 01:44:16,630
for the last 20 years, taking drugs etc. she has shifted the original symptoms without even

710
01:44:16,730 --> 01:44:20,380
herself to remember how was originally.

711
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:31,110
When you start treating and you see at this point there are symptoms of Ignatia, give Ignatia

712
01:44:31,210 --> 01:44:32,100
and the headache?

713
01:44:32,200 --> 01:44:37,800
What happens to the headache? Nothing but the headaches start shifting a little bit and

714
01:44:37,900 --> 01:44:45,710
becoming more clear and eventually the headaches sit on the right side, damping,

715
01:44:45,810 --> 01:44:54,680
bursting headache and says, oh my god, my eyes will come out and say Belladonna now

716
01:44:54,780 --> 01:44:57,530
and then the headaches are affected.

717
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:09,630
So you give a remedy for the headaches and the headaches do not change but this is the remedy

718
01:45:09,730 --> 01:45:18,600
you have to give first to go deeper into the next layer. You can not avoid that but

719
01:45:18,700 --> 01:45:27,100
if you have given Belladonna, Belladonna has acted very well and then your Belladonna

720
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:35,840
was decided upon the headache symptoms, then these headache symptoms had to be back

721
01:45:35,940 --> 01:45:42,590
but in Arsenicum case you did not prescribe upon the asthma condition.

722
01:45:42,690 --> 01:45:49,920
You prescribed upon the generalities and upon the peculiarities.

723
01:45:50,020 --> 01:46:04,350
So when we say coming back we mean these symptoms on which originally we based our prescription. Clear?

724
01:46:12,870 --> 01:46:19,000
-I just want to tell you something. When I walked down here the stairs last night,

725
01:46:19,100 --> 01:46:28,000
somebody smoked and that little smoke made me cough. And after that I had so much mucus coming out

726
01:46:28,100 --> 01:46:34,100
all down the way and you remember before I never had mucus.

727
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:40,840
I had to vomit 2 times, it was terrible, it was disgusting, she goes besides me and...

728
01:46:40,940 --> 01:46:42,190
-She can confirm it.

729
01:46:43,020 --> 01:46:51,170
-And it continued after I came home, I was so tired but I had to go to bed and I take something with me

730
01:46:51,270 --> 01:46:53,270
to spit in it.

731
01:46:56,270 --> 01:47:03,920
I was so tired when I come home, so I must go to bed but after a while, after I laid down it stopped.

732
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:15,510
But then I start thinking about all things and I got so angry that I want to throw all the furniture out

733
01:47:15,610 --> 01:47:19,100
of the balcony but I could not do that.

734
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:25,010
-You could not do that? Why not? You pay to buy new furniture and...

735
01:47:25,110 --> 01:47:29,100
-Yes it OK but I think about the other person sitting there out eating and...

736
01:47:31,930 --> 01:47:39,420
So I had to do something else and I woke out to ask for help.

737
01:47:40,260 --> 01:47:46,850
So we talked about so many things and I cried and it goes better.

738
01:47:47,340 --> 01:47:48,190
-How you feel now?

739
01:47:48,290 --> 01:47:56,660
-Very tired, I was very tired before I go down here too and I had the same feeling that in the beginning

740
01:47:56,760 --> 01:48:01,410
after China it started a heavy feeling between the shoulders.

741
01:48:01,510 --> 01:48:03,410
-Heavy feeling between the shoulders.

742
01:48:03,510 --> 01:48:09,990
-Yes it pressed me down and that feeling started again. We saw a movie here and it started again

743
01:48:10,090 --> 01:48:12,040
and I feel very exhausted.

744
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:21,240
-Very good. Medorrhinum she forgot to say, yes of course she took Medorrhinum that's why she says

745
01:48:21,340 --> 01:48:26,710
how she reacted. She reacted after Medorrhinum, she took Medorrhinum and then

746
01:48:26,810 --> 01:48:30,510
she had all this reaction.

747
01:48:36,570 --> 01:48:42,170
-So tell me what happened again after taking Medorrhinum 200?

748
01:48:42,270 --> 01:48:51,970
-The same evening, very short after, when I go down the stairs here I start coughing and

749
01:48:52,070 --> 01:48:59,560
I get lots of mucus, all the way home, mucus, mucus, I had to vomit 2 times.

750
01:49:05,900 --> 01:49:11,300
-So you went home, you still brought out mucus?

751
01:49:11,400 --> 01:49:17,300
-I still brought out for a while but I was so tired which I had to lay down

752
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:28,490
and take something with me to spit in it. And then these thoughts are starting from past.

753
01:49:28,590 --> 01:49:36,290
-Some thoughts from the past which made you very angry and you wanted to throw everything

754
01:49:36,390 --> 01:49:40,740
out of the window, correct?
-Yes.

755
01:49:40,840 --> 01:49:42,960
-Then?

756
01:49:48,310 --> 01:50:06,210
-I was not so much better in my distention, not so good, it continued for quite a while

757
01:50:06,310 --> 01:50:12,560
and the constipation too but the knee began hurting.

758
01:50:13,060 --> 01:50:28,960
This right knee I had trouble before and this started again and this has continued very long.

759
01:50:29,060 --> 01:50:40,060
I was really tired after the remedy. I don't sleep much better, I still sleep very little.

760
01:50:41,070 --> 01:50:51,210
For long time I could sleep only 2-3 hours in the night and I think before Christmas

761
01:50:51,310 --> 01:50:58,210
I sent you a fax because I was not better, I was constipated, distention, everything,

762
01:50:58,310 --> 01:51:03,390
I was not very good but you said no other remedy.

763
01:51:09,390 --> 01:51:25,740
In the end of December I went to Thailand on holiday and 2 times after food it was shellfish

764
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:29,490
I get very sick.
-With diarrhea?

765
01:51:29,590 --> 01:51:37,140
-Yes vomiting, diarrhea very sick, so I had to take Arsenicum.

766
01:51:41,390 --> 01:51:52,470
And I got better very fast, I was just tired for some days but then I eat something again

767
01:51:52,570 --> 01:51:57,520
and a new vomiting and diarrhea started again.

768
01:51:57,620 --> 01:52:05,450
And I took one dose Arsenicum and one dose the other time and one dose now and I got better very fast.

769
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:10,950
After a day or something I could eat.

770
01:52:13,550 --> 01:52:27,440
It has been several things happened to me because when I come home I was still very constipated

771
01:52:27,540 --> 01:52:34,690
and distended and last year on July I got something.

772
01:52:34,790 --> 01:52:47,690
I had to tell you because I take a sample from the spit and from a year ago I got this

773
01:52:48,090 --> 01:52:50,290
but I didn't take them.

774
01:52:58,380 --> 01:53:06,610
-Spit examination.
-From the sputum examination.

775
01:53:06,710 --> 01:53:10,450
-This an American man.

776
01:53:10,550 --> 01:53:22,200
-And you got Syphilinum and Chlamydiosinum and Ergocinum.  enterobacteria...

777
01:53:22,300 --> 01:53:37,550
-I just start in the first stage in February and I nearly... now and after that very slowly better.

778
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:44,620
So I'm now a little frustrated because I'm not sure if it's Medorrhinum or this

779
01:53:44,720 --> 01:53:48,960
but I'm very good now.

780
01:53:52,210 --> 01:54:02,360
The last 4-5 weeks I nearly go every day to the toilet, very little distention, here in Alonissos

781
01:54:02,460 --> 01:54:17,860
I have distention 2-3 times very little, very fast went away again but I broke my arm too in March

782
01:54:17,960 --> 01:54:29,860
and my friend had Arnica in her pocket. I take it immediately for 3 days and then Symphytum.

783
01:54:29,960 --> 01:54:31,780
-Why Symphytum, you broke it?

784
01:54:31,880 --> 01:54:44,200
-I broke it here. It was really broken and here too, after 10 days this broke here was very good,

785
01:54:44,300 --> 01:54:53,450
you could hardly see it on the photos. One more thing because I was skiing in February.

786
01:54:53,550 --> 01:55:06,230
it was before this and this knee was nearly good again. It was better but still painful

787
01:55:06,330 --> 01:55:20,280
and then I do ski and I fell and it was so bad, it has been really bad for months before that

788
01:55:20,380 --> 01:55:24,530
and I do nothing but after that the whole night I couldn't sleep.

789
01:55:24,630 --> 01:55:33,630
It was so painful. The next day I think I take Rhus tox.

790
01:55:35,140 --> 01:55:39,030
-And it helped?
-Immediately.

791
01:55:39,130 --> 01:55:44,530
After that I have some pain but it's getting better and better.

792
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:56,640
It's quite good. So just to confirm all things I have done.

793
01:55:59,880 --> 01:56:05,040
-At this moment which is the biggest problem you would say?

794
01:56:05,140 --> 01:56:11,290
-The biggest problem because my stomach is so good, the biggest problem is that I told you

795
01:56:11,390 --> 01:56:13,480
when I come here.

796
01:56:14,830 --> 01:56:20,950
-Wait a moment. What is the biggest problem at this moment?

797
01:56:21,050 --> 01:56:28,690
It's the problem that you told me in the beginning privately?

798
01:56:28,790 --> 01:56:42,440
-Yes but I can say that before full moon I always am worse on everything, more tired,

799
01:56:42,540 --> 01:56:58,940
difficult to concentrate, clumsy. It's not so much... because this was a big problem.

800
01:56:59,040 --> 01:57:10,270
So if I get rid of this in the mind, it would be perfect. But I will say I 'm also thirsty,

801
01:57:10,370 --> 01:57:18,520
so that's better, I 'm not so hot, I'm less hot. Sometimes I'm quite chilly, after Medorrhinum

802
01:57:18,620 --> 01:57:25,620
sometimes I was quite chilly. I had to put on sweaters, here in Alonissos.

803
01:57:32,870 --> 01:57:35,370
And my sleep is quite good too.

804
01:57:45,400 --> 01:57:52,600
Sometimes when I think about examination or something is a little bad but it's very good

805
01:57:52,700 --> 01:57:57,790
for the last 3-4 weeks.

806
01:57:58,800 --> 01:58:03,540
Before that it was no one day, sleepless.

807
01:58:31,860 --> 01:58:43,010
-Tell me how is at this moment do you have a relationship? Are with a man, the same man?

808
01:58:43,110 --> 01:58:45,110
-Yes, the same man.

809
01:58:47,610 --> 01:58:53,780
-How is your sexual desire?
-I think it's quite normal.

810
01:58:56,610 --> 01:59:06,010
-You are sexual type or you are really romantic type?

811
01:59:06,110 --> 01:59:07,860
-More the romantic type.

812
01:59:09,390 --> 01:59:17,360
-You are not really sexually very interested?
-No, not that interested.

813
01:59:19,110 --> 01:59:40,590
-But you need in order to have sex, you need to have some nice environment and things like that,

814
01:59:40,690 --> 01:59:42,940
more romantic?

815
01:59:43,610 --> 01:59:51,440
-More before, not so much now but yes I like it.

816
02:00:04,690 --> 02:00:09,840
-The irritability in you is normal? Now you are not irritable?

817
02:00:09,940 --> 02:00:19,360
-I'm less irritable but I'm a little bit irritable if things go too slow, I'm impatient.

818
02:00:22,010 --> 02:00:32,910
Still I like things to go fast but not as fast as before, I'm more relaxed, I'm not bored so much,

819
02:00:34,510 --> 02:00:38,410
before I was bored, I had to do something all the time.

820
02:00:38,510 --> 02:00:41,660
-So you enjoy more now things you are doing.

821
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:46,020
-Yes and be by myself because the man I live with, he works in another place,

822
02:00:46,120 --> 02:00:53,990
so he is away for a couple of weeks and I like that. I think it's OK to be by myself relaxed

823
02:00:54,090 --> 02:01:02,320
but I'm still quite tired in a way in the evening, quite early, it's difficult to study in the evening

824
02:01:02,420 --> 02:01:11,170
because I'm so tired. But I'm a little better and that's the reason I sleep better.

825
02:01:13,670 --> 02:01:16,920
A little bit better on this tiredness in the evening.

826
02:01:19,170 --> 02:01:21,570
-In general how you feel, how you are?

827
02:01:21,670 --> 02:01:25,070
-In general I feel much better.

828
02:01:25,170 --> 02:01:26,330
-You better say it.

829
02:01:26,430 --> 02:01:39,410
-In general I'm much better, I'm very satisfied because the stomach problem has been solved,

830
02:01:39,510 --> 02:01:42,760
it's like a new life when this functions.

831
02:01:49,750 --> 02:02:01,260
-It was quite a severe problem but anyhow thank you We go inside.

832
02:02:04,260 --> 02:02:08,090
No medicine.
-No medicine? OK.
