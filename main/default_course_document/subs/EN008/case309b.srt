1
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:35,350
-You got Calcarea carb. 10M one dose.

2
00:00:51,600 --> 00:01:01,600
-Immediately after I had some pains in the sacroiliac region, I think bilateral

3
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,840
and that lasted for about 24 hours.

4
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:11,570
I think this is an old symptom which I had after child birth.

5
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,750
-This pain after child birth?

6
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:29,500
-Yes for some months I had this pain and it came back for 1 day, then it passed.

7
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,590
But it was immediately after I took the remedy, it was very quick reaction.

8
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:46,670
Then I noticed that the night after I took the remedy, I woke up early in the morning

9
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:57,260
with repeated sneezing. This is also a symptom that I had before.

10
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,420
-That was a cold that had started already?

11
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:10,680
-There was a cold 2 days after the remedy, after the party here it was very cold last time

12
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:20,920
and I felt chilly and then I developed a cold. I also felt very bad psychologically.

13
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:31,920
I had a kind of strong depression. I was thinking about the past, about some wrong things,

14
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,530
the death of my father, things like this.

15
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,670
-And you cried?
-Yes.

16
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,920
-For how long?

17
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:52,410
-I was here, I could not manifest myself for much but for 1 day or more I cried,

18
00:02:52,510 --> 00:03:01,520
I didn't come to the lecture. So these were the immediate changes.

19
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:11,030
Then some changes that lasted, I can say the dizziness has gone, I feel quite OK

20
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:21,130
from this point of view and I feel that I am not so tired, I have enough strength.

21
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,520
-To carry on with your work.

22
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:33,020
-Yes but I repeated the remedy because before coming here I had a kind of anticipation syndrome,

23
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:40,770
I was very worried about how shall I feel here because I had some symptoms this summer

24
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,020
and I felt that they might come back.

25
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:51,260
So I took again the remedy before I travel in LN potencies because I thought not to have

26
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,110
an aggravation, so I took LM potencies.

27
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:08,130
I took for 3 days before the travel and then when I was here, I continued to take until last Saturday.

28
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,650
About 8 times.

29
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,360
-That means 8 days?
-No, I took 1 dose every 2 days.

30
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:36,620
-So 16 days all together.
-Yes and I felt very well.

31
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:44,440
After about 2 days that I started to take my worries were not so big,

32
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:51,790
I consider that I actually cope very well with the situation and I felt quite good.

33
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:01,460
I noticed that my appetite has reduced a little bit.

34
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,110
-That's good.

35
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:16,150
-And maybe the menses are a bit less abundant than before but still they are quite abundant.

36
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,350
-Still clotted?

37
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:30,620
-Yes and they come in 28 days instead of 30, 32 that they came before.

38
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:41,480
The sleep is normal, I tend not to sleep so much on the left side now but sometimes

39
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,820
I sleep on the left side and sometimes on my back with the hands up.

40
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,220
-Which you didn't do before?

41
00:05:51,320 --> 00:06:00,060
-Yes they were times that I did it but in May I didn't notice this,

42
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,660
I think I slept very much on the left side.

43
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:10,060
-What about your fears, fear of death, of insanity, of dark, of flying?

44
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:17,320
-These fears are still rather strong. This is the main problem.

45
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:23,130
It is a kind of a state of anxiety that maybe I did not describe very well last time.

46
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:30,990
This fear of death is a kind of a permanent idea but it's not a fear of immediate death.

47
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:41,890
It is more the idea that one day we shall all die and this makes me regard the daily life

48
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,240
with a kind of sadness.

49
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:53,390
-Are you thinking about the after death situation?

50
00:06:53,490 --> 00:07:00,640
-Yes, I think it is a kind of fear about the unknown. I don't know if this idea bothers me.

51
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:06,640
It is quite normal but maybe after the operation, after the experience I had which was

52
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:13,740
quite frightening. But not immediately after, after some time this started.

53
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:20,390
-You will consider that fear of the dark is still there?

54
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:30,750
-Yes it's more strong I think, to be alone in the dark, especially if I'm alone at home.

55
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,320
-Fear of insanity?

56
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:39,050
-Yes this is still present because I don't know if these ideas are so strong in my mind.

57
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:43,490
I think it's not normal and I can perceive that.

58
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:47,080
-Is this a fear or is some thoughts?

59
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:55,230
-It's a kind of fear, I think it's not normal to have these thoughts and I'm concerned about it.

60
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:02,400
-So you wanted to say something more about this anxiety?

61
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:13,040
-I noticed there is a fear that I maybe had also last time, it's a kind of new symptom and

62
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,290
I didn't mention it.

63
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:23,040
When I travel somewhere, it may happen that I may wake up from sleep with an idea

64
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:29,560
that I don't know exactly where I am and this produces for 1 sec or so a kind of fear.

65
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:37,730
Then I realize where I am and everything is OK but for a very short time it's a kind of panic.

66
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:46,160
And it happened also at home when I arrived, 2-3 times I had this sensation until

67
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,750
I could adapt to the place.

68
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,090
From this point of view I was worried when I took again the remedy, thinking that now

69
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:00,930
I'm travelling again and maybe this sensation will come again.

70
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,130
-And it did not come.
-It came only once.

71
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:19,660
Actually when I'm far away from home I have these fears more strong.

72
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:26,910
When I'm at home I feel quite fine. I don't feel these anxieties so much because

73
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:32,270
everything is familiar but when I go in another place, it's worse.

74
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,560
-I want to ask you some questions also. Your feet continue to be cold?

75
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:51,290
-Yes. I'm quite chilly, I need to dress very warm.

76
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:56,730
-And the desire eggs is still there, as it was.

77
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:01,720
-It is but I don't think I said it was a strong desire. I like eggs...

78
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:09,480
-But not very strong. The fear of high places have you checked?

79
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:19,650
-It is there. After eating you feel better?

80
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:26,910
-I think that I ate less. I don't feel so much this need to eat.

81
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:42,830
-Cold weather in general still affects you?
-Yes I'm chilly.

82
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:51,480
-I don't remember the nails.
-Brittle, soft.

83
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,470
-And they continue to be soft?

84
00:10:53,570 --> 00:11:01,830
-Yes, maybe not so fragile as before but still they are soft.

85
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:13,330
When the weather gets cold, I have the tendency to get easily a cold.

86
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:23,400
There was a change for instance in the temperature from 45 degrees to 15,

87
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:38,150
in the beginning of September and I developed a cold, strong chills and a fever to 38,6.

88
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,890
-And lasted for how long?

89
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:46,130
-Very short because I took Aconite. Maybe I should not have taken anything.

90
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:49,380
-How high?
-C30.

91
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:58,990
-One time?
-One time and it was finished that day or next.

92
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,740
-Did you take any other remedy?
-No.

93
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,630
-The hey fever you don't know?

94
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:27,220
-I have a rhinorrhea, usually in the morning when it is colder, I sneeze maybe a few times

95
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:32,650
and then there is a rhinorrhea and then it is gone during the day.

96
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:40,810
-This is how it was before or has changed now?

97
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:47,990
-Maybe it is a little bit more than before but I had it before also.

98
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:57,190
-The hey fever was mostly in Autumn and Spring or it was all the time?

99
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:03,520
-All the time, it is connected with a sensation of coldness.

100
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:10,570
If it is cold outside, in the morning especially, I get stronger sneezing.

101
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:22,810
I also have another symptom, pain of the cervical region during night time when lying in bed.

102
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,080
-If you wake up in the night?

103
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:36,920
-Yes if I wake up I feel there is a pain and in the morning also when I wake up I feel

104
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:46,720
this kind of stiffness. I must have a good position of the head in order to feel comfortable.

105
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:01,960
-You have said you had vomiting from motion.

106
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:14,780
-I think it has improved this, I didn't notice it here but I sit mainly in the front of the car.

107
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,670
-You had difficulty falling asleep.

108
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:30,250
-Now I don't have that but I wake up rather early more than before.

109
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:34,600
I tend to wake up about 5-6 o'clock.

110
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:47,750
-Do you think we must have a remedy or do you feel we should wait.

111
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:57,470
-No, I feel rather well, especially after I repeated the remedy, I feel it did a good action

112
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:02,580
without having an aggravation but I felt good.

113
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,830
-OK thank you.

114
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:39,660
-So what shall we do with this case? Wait, repeat, go higher?

115
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:54,330
Who says wait? Exactly, this is the idea.
