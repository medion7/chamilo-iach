1
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:31,040
-So this is a follow up of the follow up of the follow up of the third day and

2
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:39,300
you took Sulphur 200, I want to make a resume and come to the main points,

3
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:45,060
Sulphur 200 and the next afternoon how it was?

4
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,550
-I felt beautiful, in the evening I was full of energy, the next morning I woke up

5
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:58,050
full of energy, I slept good and then when I slept I was very cold, I felt very cold.

6
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:04,990
My feet were cold but I went to sleep about midnight and I slept very good.

7
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:19,140
I dreamed about Homeopathy and studying and journeys, normal. At 6.30 I woke up,

8
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:31,670
I had very clear mind. I felt really good, full of energy and good. And then at about 9

9
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:39,990
I started having pain in the nap here and slowly slowly it moved on and developed to

10
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:47,750
in the chest going up a little bit to the neck which was there before probably and  the neck

11
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,960
and starting to oppress.

12
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,660
-What was the time when you told me that?

13
00:01:54,760 --> 00:02:04,570
-I told you when we came back from the noon break because it was very bad during the end.

14
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:21,320
-It was about 5 o'clock when you told me that I have this pain, you put your hand over here

15
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,510
you say I have that pain extending and all that and then I asked the cardiologists

16
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:32,360
to take a look at you again and at the same time I gave you a remedy after the ECG

17
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:47,780
We had a repetition of the ECG at 9.30 because someone all the time was phoning...

18
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,610
-The clinic was full.

19
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:02,110
-Then the next day you had another ECG and today you had another one.

20
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:11,650
-Today the pain is here already, it finished here, now it's on the right.

21
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:17,520
-But what did you feel when you got the remedy?

22
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:27,570
-One minute after I took it, I had a hot flash going up in the face for a minute and then it's gone.

23
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,570
-What happened to the pain?

24
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:34,650
-The pain went down a little bit and slowly slowly it went away, by the next morning

25
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:41,490
it was gone. Just when I was moving like a muscle pain.

26
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,600
-I see.

27
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,080
-Blood pressure also went down and down.

28
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:56,920
-That was interesting also, we will say in the class.

29
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:12,900
-Last night it was the diastolic was 80, from 160, this morning was again a little bit high.

30
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,930
-From quite high when we started.

31
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:37,490
-But today I feel bad, last night was very bad.

32
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:49,920
-What happened? Describe. You forgot to say, I said no food in the same night, only water.

33
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,790
-I didn't eat and I drunk only water.

34
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:58,100
-Then the next day you had the ECG again and because he told you everything is all right

35
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:02,900
he said to me and you went out and you smoked.

36
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,990
-Just one puff. I didn't eat for 24 hours, I didn't smoke.

37
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,350
-Not 24.

38
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:16,490
-Yes because I didn't eat before I came here, I ate last time it was 2 o'clock at noon.

39
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:24,230
Then you told me not to eat and I ate only the next day when I came back. I was very ...

40
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:31,110
-I told you from the very beginning you put too much weight, you are going on fruits

41
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:35,560
only fruits. Just find any fruit you like.

42
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:41,150
-I put on weight on fruits.
-If you eat fruits?

43
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:51,020
-Then eat broccoli only, spinach, zucchinis.
-I eat.

44
00:05:51,120 --> 00:06:01,200
-Only vegetables, if you eat only vegetables and fruits I can not believe how you put on weight.

45
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:13,860
-I try. I ate yesterday in the evening, so I joined the celebration and I ate and

46
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:21,970
I didn't smoke, so maybe I ate more and at night I fell asleep but at 2.30 in the morning

47
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:30,020
I woke up with all sweat, hot. The whole night I was hot, I took the covers out and

48
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:43,860
I was sweating in the chest and the whole part here was burning like pain burning up here

49
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,610
with a pressure.

50
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,850
-What did you eat? You ate different things?

51
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,190
-I ate different things, they were many things like salad and...

52
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,040
-'Mezedes'.

53
00:06:54,530 --> 00:07:06,690
-Yes a little piece of lamb which made it worse, I can't digest lamb and till now

54
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:14,270
it's burning only when I take soda water, normally I take Nux vomica for that and it works.

55
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:19,050
-Forget your treatments for the time being.

56
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:25,790
-So I took soda water but it's still burning in here, it's like rheumatic pain.

57
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:33,870
I feel down very low energy like a flu.

58
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:48,700
-What you have to do is to eat very lightly, drink a lot of water but also don't get exhausted at all.

59
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,020
-Normally as I look at you, you should be sleeping by now.

60
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:01,780
-I'm very tired.

61
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:27,370
-So I think... I'm suspecting the high blood pressure etc. something is going on with your

62
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:43,920
heart, so it's better to prevent than to treat. So I'm very careful and I don't want of  any kind of accidents here.

63
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:54,560
So we will analyze your case and then we finish. So actually I would

64
00:08:54,660 --> 00:09:01,410
suggest that you just go to sleep, lie down and sleep and give us a follow up tomorrow.

65
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,830
And that's it.

66
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:11,570
-But can Paul explain me what is going on? That makes me worried. If everything is fine

67
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:14,310
but it doesn't behave like everything is fine.

68
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:19,320
-Let me worry. The clinical picture was worrying.

69
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,320
-I knew, that's why I told him to tell me.

70
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:26,410
-But you forgot to tell me that every time I take a remedy I have the same pain.

71
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:30,580
-Yes I have.
-Anyhow I will explain to you later on.

72
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,580
-Well I need that explanation, otherwise I get worried.

73
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:44,670
-Yes you need. The clinical picture which you presented indicates that you have to lose weight

74
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:49,410
and you have to be careful with diet, no smoking at all.

75
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:59,930
If we don't want to have a problem. Of course if you are careless...

76
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,180
-I'll say goodbye early.

77
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:13,750
-We don't want, let me say good bye first and then everybody else can do whatever they like.

78
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:52,290
As you hear by 5 o'clock in the afternoon she says, I have this pain here which I always

79
00:10:52,390 --> 00:11:02,960
had every time I took Phos. I asked her whether it extends here. She says it was like this.

80
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:09,570
She showed up to there and what worried me is always when the patient,

81
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:17,090
this is taught in medicine, when the patient put their hand like this, I have pain, not like this,

82
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:20,510
it's dangerous. If they put like this, it's not so dangerous.

83
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:24,190
I don't know is this true, this is my observation.

84
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:27,510
-It is so, exactly.

85
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:33,180
-So she puts like this, she said like this, I called Paul immediately

86
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:40,360
I said please have a cardiogram, see what is going on.

87
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:46,150
Paul gave a cardiogram and then he will explain to you what he found.

88
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:56,120
-In the beginning just very brief introduction into ECG and I'm only focusing into the changes

89
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:02,610
which you will see in the picture. This is the classical picture of a healthy person.

90
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:10,590
It's one upper left. A very sensitive part which can react very quickly

91
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:25,020
to transitory circulation problems, is this part here, it's called the T wave.

92
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:33,530
Already a small attack of angina pectoris is efficient to get this whole part moving.

93
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:42,280
We often can see changes in the T wave which we call terminal negative changes.

94
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:49,680
Most of the T wave is on the positive sector plus here and the last bit goes down into

95
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:57,760
the negative side. So this picture I mentioned because we will see it in the ECG and

96
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:07,700
this is not pathognomonic, it's still kind of normal. This here is pathology.

97
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:19,120
Physiologically it can only appear in the third lead.

98
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:28,520
If you see any changes in the T curve like here in the lead 2,aVF, V5 or V6

99
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:33,260
which are from the side lead of the chest, it is pathological

100
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:43,850
and it means that in the posterior lateral area of the heart you have circulation problems,

101
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:47,030
not enough blood is being supplied there.

102
00:13:48,710 --> 00:14:00,350
If you do an X-ray of the coronary artery of the heart, if you only see this picture

103
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:06,570
in the right coronary artery, it's still OK, you don't have to operate.

104
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:16,380
To make it more precise if only the right coronary artery is affected and everything on the left side is

105
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:23,070
OK and you have enough blood supply, you do not need an operation, it can be balanced.

106
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:33,540
The first ECG was taken on 16th of May at 7p.m. after she had reported that

107
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:38,150
she had pressing pains which were to her left arm.

108
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:49,960
Since then all ECG is very well, so you all will be able to see that over here

109
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:57,040
 to the right side the T-curve, the T-wave is negative whereas at the beginning of the ECG

110
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:07,040
is still positive. Positive-negative. Over here on the third lead it also is negative but

111
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:16,890
we put in parenthesis because it can be normal in the third lead, under the...

112
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:32,080
If the other leads are normal and then in this ECG we see in the second lead and third lead

113
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:45,580
and the aVF we have a negative T-wave. This is connected with posterior wall of the heart

114
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:54,590
and V5 and V6 both also have a negative T and this reflects the lateral side of the heart.

115
00:15:56,090 --> 00:16:02,100
We can also see that she is having pain, which is pushing her blood pressure up

116
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:07,990
whereas if we monitor the entire period of time, after she received Sulphur

117
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:18,420
the diastolic blood pressure value never exceeded the 100 and all together it never exceeded 180.

118
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:25,570
And I never in my life have seen such a dramatic amelioration within 24 hours,

119
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:36,740
going down from 220 or 240, down to 140, such a blood pressure usually is being treated with

120
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:42,400
at least a double combination, maybe of a triple combination of different allopathic remedies.

121
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:54,560
After we saw this ECG George made a prescription. 2 hours later we made a new ECG.

122
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:01,720
In the meantime the blood pressure had calmed down on the diastolic level.

123
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:10,720
 Clinically the patient could report very noticeable amelioration of her symptoms,

124
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:18,330
the pre-cardio pressing pain had vanished and she could still feel a slight pain

125
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,850
in the area of her left shoulder.

126
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:30,410
In the ECG we can see that in the second and third lead in the aVF the alterations of the

127
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:39,720
T-wave remain almost unchanged. The first 3 leads belong to the posterior wall of the hearts

128
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:46,080
and in the lower bottom, as I just showed, you can see that we already have a big change there,

129
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:54,150
the T-wave is not clearly visibly in the negative anymore. It's more around zero.

130
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:06,210
This ECG was taken on Sunday at 11.30, the blood pressure is 100-160 and

131
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:12,320
I have to write here that she has a sinus rhythm in the ECG and it's normal.

132
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:22,070
I again mark the areas which we want to watch with little arrows.

133
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:36,310
Here we already have a positive T-wave, here in the third lead it may be negative and

134
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:43,400
also down here in the aVF we can see the slight positiveness of the wave.

135
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:54,320
Down here is very beautiful and visible and also here. Normal.

136
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:08,520
This is the control ECG from today 2pm, we see non specific changes to ECG.

137
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:21,480
According to these changes a cardiologist could never conclude ischemia.

138
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:35,170
So let's look at it together once more. Here we have the T-wave again, it's more or less

139
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:43,730
going around zero plus/minus zero, this is not specific. Of course a cardiologist focuses

140
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:50,560
his attention on these things but you have no evidence of an ischemia and

141
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:59,570
down here you see the ECG of the lateral wall of the heart and it's a beautiful non pathological ECG.

142
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:14,980
And at the very end when you see such a picture in the ECG like on the bottom left, this is the famous party wave.

143
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:24,850
If you see this, the patient has acute infraction of the myocardium.

144
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:42,810
-Here we see of course the necessity of a specialist and we see also something

145
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:54,230
that again and again I will stress, that we don't act irresponsible. We always cooperate with

146
00:20:54,330 --> 00:21:00,980
the different specialties wherever it's necessary and at the same time we say that

147
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:08,810
Homeopathy is not only for common colds. Homeopathy is for serious conditions also

148
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:14,320
and here we have to analyze the case why we prescribed. What happened

149
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:21,660
when we gave Sulphur previous day, next day you have this. What has happened?

150
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:35,160
The patient felt good, as she said, full of energy again, no problems, the heart...

151
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,420
Are you going to treat yes or no?

152
00:21:44,910 --> 00:22:00,400
In 2 minutes I said bring a dose of Latrodectus mactans. This is a case which is very close

153
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:26,820
to Latrodecturs mactans. You will have 30 here. And how do we know that this is the

154
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:32,820
effect of Latrod mactans and not of Sulphur since 2 days ago we gave Sulphur.

155
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:41,800
Now after 24 hours we give another remedy and then the 3rd day we have the normalization.

156
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:49,430
How do we know that it's not from Sulphur, it's from Latrod, can anybody tell me?

157
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:04,410
-I had one question before about the blood pressure. If you see the constitution of that woman,

158
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:13,310
you can think that she already has a coronary heart disease and this high blood pressure

159
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:20,760
she had maybe it's somehow necessary to get enough circulation in the coronary arteries

160
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:29,390
and when the blood pressure is going down very quickly, maybe this was a reason for ischemia.

161
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:36,910
So it's a question if it's right, the blood pressure it goes down so quickly.

162
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:43,750
-Well I don't if Paul has to comment something.

163
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:58,980
-Not in this area. The patient in the hospital with a blood pressure of 240 over 140 then

164
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:08,590
the optimal level to which you want to get the patient is 160 over 95, this is the best.

165
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:22,660
-It's not easy. Now in this particular case there are certain things which I would like to comment.

166
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,870
So not to give wrong impressions.

167
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:34,730
-I think the reaction came from Latrod because 1 minute after you gave the remedy

168
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,660
she showed a clear reaction.

169
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:46,860
-She had a clear reaction with the flashing, most probably giving the resolution of the situation.

170
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:57,660
Latrodectus mactans gave an immediate action, reaction and amelioration.

171
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:05,900
You understand that I was very very worried and I wanted to know how she feels.

172
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:13,430
And she gave the report 2 hours later that the clinical picture was improving but

173
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:20,870
Paul says the ECG is the same. Anyhow that was encouraging, it was not worse.

174
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:36,060
Therefore it showed, in the mean time I told her to go to bed and lie down, don't eat anything.

175
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:44,160
You don't fill up the stomach with food when you have a situation like that. I don't know.

176
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:55,390
Cardiologists most probably think the same. We would like your feedback, we are not cardiologists.

177
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:07,120
-This is of course an valuable advantage, if the patient doesn't eat because then

178
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:12,420
if the case is going down further, we have an empty stomach for reanimation.

179
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:24,960
-Give us your experience Paul when you made next day the ECG what did she ask you

180
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:28,400
immediately after you said it is normal, what did she say?

181
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:35,630
-That was the ECG from Sunday and while I was still cleaning the ECG machine,

182
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:38,100
she is lightening a cigarette.

183
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:50,810
-She said something immediately. She said, when can I have my breakfast?

184
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,980
-Yes.

185
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:00,210
-The first question was can I have my breakfast. It was in the morning because we were

186
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:10,800
on the telephone and she said please and when Paul gave me the good news, next day normal,

187
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:17,650
I could sleep. That's how I lose my sleep. You see how you lose your sleep.

188
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:30,070
When we have 3 cases with such aggressive high blood pressure and all the time to control,

189
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:38,170
to see what is going on and to see that everything is all right. You go and sleep

190
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:44,250
and when 160 nice eyes are watching.

191
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:54,750
-360.
-320. Mathematics.

192
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:03,730
-I think not only the reaction of Latrodectus immediately shows that Sulphur has not acted

193
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:09,900
because Sulphur has a superficial amelioration which could not stand.

194
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,990
It was this action that you told us in the third group when the remedy acts not,

195
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:20,610
it goes up and then it goes down. That's the wrong direction I think.

196
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:33,400
-No we don't agree in that. Unfortunately when you are treating cases where

197
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:45,260
you have depressions and low energy etc. and the energy rises and if there is...

198
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:59,650
The change in focus of disturbance will change. From that level in which is depression

199
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:08,070
now from the mental or emotional it will go to physical. So you feel very good but

200
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:20,420
 where is a sensitive point in your organism. What the psychiatrists call somatisation.

201
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:34,490
Now she has been preparing herself for this. When I saw her with high blood pressure she took 6 kilos

202
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:44,940
immediately I know it, I say now what are you doing? Because you are afraid that

203
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:55,650
the arteries will not act properly. So the flow comes again, life comes back but

204
00:29:55,750 --> 00:30:03,510
the artery or one point of the artery is not enough to take the flow and therefore it contracts.

205
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:13,740
Here fortunately I believe it's a contraction of the artery and not an infarct because

206
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:23,290
if we had an infarct, we may had different development. We don't know what was going

207
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:33,540
to happen of course. We suggest. We don't know what is going to happen if this person

208
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:43,130
after the pain is gone, she goes to the disco and she starts jumping around or if she goes

209
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:48,880
back to 'Niriides'. We don't know. So we have to be very careful with these things

210
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:56,220
because we know how these things start and by the time she reaches Niriides, then there

211
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:06,310
is a full blown heart infarct and then things are different.

212
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:15,590
So therefore the remedy is acting. It is correctly acting, it is bringing down the problem

213
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:21,870
into the physical and then it is life threatening, you have to treat. That is the case.

214
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:31,950
Something else also that I want to make you aware with the cases that we see.

215
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:42,090
Do not think that everybody, I don't say about her, in generally that everybody who comes there

216
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:46,810
and sits in front of the class can tell everything, what is going on in their lives.

217
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:53,100
And I don't make any connection, I don't know anything about this case,

218
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,280
so if I give you examples have nothing to do with the case.

219
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:15,180
A woman she goes for a few months in that state in which she finds blond hair and

220
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:26,150
I'm black in the pillow. Drops, she doesn't want to analyze what it means.

221
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:38,800
In her bed there is a hair of another woman and then she sees that the husband changes some

222
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:48,280
habits and then 2-3 months and she is watching and she is pressurizing herself.

223
00:32:50,530 --> 00:33:03,930
She will not say anything just suspicions but actually the suspicions are more and more confirmed.

224
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:12,010
This in a case where they have the tendency of high blood pressure, you will see the pressure rise.

225
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:16,380
They come to you, they don't say anything, just suspicion.

226
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:26,020
That question is so powerful for the woman, the blood pressure is very high.

227
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:34,090
In this case when you have a reason to be there but the reason is not clear to the person himself

228
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:40,350
can not speak it out, can not discuss it, even with her best friend the woman will not say  anything

229
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:47,930
because it's something very hurting and all this is kept inside and she comes to you

230
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:53,510
and gives you symptoms. She hast the blood pressure, she loves, she talks, I have this,

231
00:33:53,610 --> 00:34:07,700
I have that, desires sweets and you give the remedy and the blood pressure goes down and up again.

232
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:19,690
That you have to be aware to investigate a little bit further and if you can find a solution.

233
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:24,750
For people like this you have to find a solution because if they don't have,

234
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:29,410
they are going to lose their job. Their boss will say you are not good.

235
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:46,350
This, am I going to lose... Responsibility, especially pressures and fast to give results,

236
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:52,840
to give effect brings the blood pressure up. So there are reasons behind it and we have to

237
00:34:52,940 --> 00:35:02,330
be aware of that issue as well that maybe there are reasons which are not told to us. Neither we care.

238
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:11,420
What we care is to find the remedy. If we find the remedy, hopefully the problems

239
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:17,250
will be solved but if you see it comes back, it comes back, it comes back,

240
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:22,080
then you have to investigate and to discuss a little bit more

241
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:28,260
to see whether such an issue is there for high blood pressure.

242
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:47,010
-I wonder if whether the change of potency of the remedy, she is wondering

243
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:57,620
 if we would have taken a different potency if you could influence the reaction to a more milder.

244
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:03,120
If you would have given a higher or lower potency if you could have seen a milder reaction

245
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:07,000
and not such a very pronounced reaction.

246
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:15,290
-She is talking about Sulphur?
-Yes.

247
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:24,180
-We don't know because we can never test the same thing twice so we don't know, that's one.

248
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:30,940
The second is that we know that the higher the potency, the more potent is the reaction.

249
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,680
If we take this as a fact which is not always so but we take it as a fact,

250
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:48,440
then it's better we stay on the low side when we prescribe in such cases and low we mean from 200 downwards.

251
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:56,720
Now I don't know what we would have done, if we had given 30, maybe the same reaction.

252
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:05,600
If we have given 12 repeatedly, maybe she would have the reaction after 5 days.

253
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:12,780
We can not know exactly what is going to happen in the same person with a different situation.

254
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,690
This answer will never get, ever.

255
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:24,710
-George you are talking about choosing a remedy and worrying and not sleeping and

256
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:32,430
here is a patient who is doing almost everything to make her treatment impossible.

257
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:36,300
He is doing just the reverse of what you expect from her.

258
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:42,450
Could you comment on her personality and the relationship, what should be doing in such case.

259
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:55,540
-She is anxious, she wants easy solutions, she doesn't want to take responsibility.

260
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:04,960
The next day, she is there and she knows I have phoned 5 times actually before Paul is finished.

261
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:11,390
I said did you finish, did you finish with the second ECG. She is hearing, George has phoned

262
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:17,200
so many times, he is worried, she is not. And the first thing she asks next day is

263
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:25,200
can I have my breakfast now, I'm OK and then she goes out and lights a cigarette.

264
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:38,030
What can I say about this? The cigarette has to be stopped, has to be clear, finished.

265
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:47,780
Also the food has to be reduced, very light food. The lighter the food, the better so it

266
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:55,280
cleans a little bit the arteries. If you can keep, this has to be kept in this diet for a few months,

267
00:38:55,380 --> 00:39:06,020
2-3 months on a very light diet it will do very good but it is very doubtful whether she will follow it.

268
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:10,360
It's very doubtful, it is true but what can you do?

269
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:17,790
You see my responsibility at this moment is not to say, you are bad.

270
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:25,040
-You are coming from the point that this angina pectoris which was quite heavy one was

271
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:30,780
a somatizing of a deeper psychological level. So you are sure that this attack

272
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,540
wouldn't have appeared without this dose of Sulphur.

273
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:43,280
-No, it would have appeared worse in about 20 days. 20days, 10 days, 3 days I don't know,

274
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:53,100
it would have appeared if she was left, it would appear and perhaps much stronger and much worse.

275
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:59,770
-A blood pressure of 240-140 is a very acute situation in your practices

276
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:06,690
and normally you send the patient to hospital because it's dangerous. You can suppose that

277
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:13,350
she is being going around with such blood pressure for quite some time and without Sulphur

278
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:20,860
I could imagine that every day something could have happened. Concerning the factors

279
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:27,940
which in large raise the risk, danger for heart attack in coronary heart disease,

280
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:47,860
 we have overweight a hyper tony, high blood pressure, she is smoking, these are already

281
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:56,500
3, I don't know about the family disposition, she was mentioning something and

282
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:08,690
 with the patient who has these factors you can expect something to happen any time.

283
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:14,060
-If Sulphur has really acted so well I don't know, I don't understand why you are coming

284
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,030
up with a new remedy in this situation?

285
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:32,360
-That is a good question but I said that if we have an acute appearing, this is an acute

286
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:40,020
episode and in this acute episode we have the possibility of life or death, life threatening

287
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:50,360
I have said, you have to treat first. Now what to treat? To give Sulphur or to give another

288
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:56,530
remedy which covers the acute symptoms. Now in this case the acute symptoms

289
00:41:56,630 --> 00:42:04,030
according to my experience were covered by Latrodectus Mactans and that's why I think

290
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:13,480
Latrodectus Mactans has acted very fast. Because the clinical picture though the ECG

291
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:19,210
has remained the same, the clinical picture in 2 hours was relieved.

292
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:27,530
-Besides the precordial pain with the radiation what else lead you to...

293
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:35,310
-Nothing else, that's all you have to know. Latrodectus Mactans, this is a good one.

294
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:41,360
The experience is that you ... she puts like this, she brings it here, goes there and goes

295
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:53,550
there. Forget it, for me is 100% that this is a heart infarct. To make these movements

296
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:54,900
here and here.

297
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:16,790
If the pain is stitching, I have a stitching pain here, I will again check out but I will not

298
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:27,040
worry. With this I said better quickly we have to act and this is the good with Homeopathy

299
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:38,930
that you can act very fast in the very beginning, not when things are really disastrous.

300
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:45,330
And that is the time where you have your best results. How many times we have saved

301
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:51,710
cases like that? Many times. For those who do full time practice and they see cases you

302
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:59,330
will have several cases but of course to prescribe wrongly, then you end up to the

303
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:08,410
hospital. There is no question. I was waiting, I said OK take the remedy, then 2 hours

304
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:14,740
later, what happened? He says the ECG is the same, the clinical picture better. OK we

305
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:23,620
can wait until tomorrow morning, that's all. Tomorrow morning, I was not sleeping the

306
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:32,650
whole night, I was waiting and telephone at 10 he comes and says good news. Thank you.

307
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:45,900
-What do you expect in the future? The Latrodectus is working on the heart but...

308
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:54,910
-In the future I expect if she takes some care about food and smoking, she will not have problem.

309
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:58,510
-No more remedy?

310
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:08,520
-We'll see. If now by treating the acute, the whole episode will bring back the state of

311
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:13,500
Sulphur, we can repeat Sulphur, we may, we have to see.

312
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:25,590
The whole organism went into a crisis with this. So she has the aftereffect of the crisis.

313
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:43,640
Put her to bed, sleep. Don't let her eat, this is also important, don't let her fill her

314
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,400
stomach too much.

315
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:09,220
-From what she reported before we know that these pains have been coming before as well

316
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:14,300
and she used to lie down and these pains were quite strong and she was repeating Phosphorus over

317
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,940
and over again for such pains.

318
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:23,030
How much damage could that have done and if then the right remedy is given do you think such pathology...

319
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:32,510
-With the Phosphorus she repeated damage no. I think the damage came when she took

320
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:36,550
the several other remedies, Magnesia carbonica. What has to do with Magn carbo I didn't

321
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:45,680
understand. She took 3 other remedies and the organism was upset and then suddenly

322
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:50,390
the blood pressure started going up. You see how sensitive it is the organism? In high

323
00:46:50,490 --> 00:47:00,360
blood pressure is down. It's not easy to bring the blood pressure down. With the wrong

324
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:06,100
remedy forget it, blood pressure will continue, there is no movement at all. Only if you

325
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:14,030
give right remedy the blood pressure can come down. You saw this, Lilium tigrinum
nothing.

326
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:26,770
-Another remedy to carry for example for people who have a history with angina, she

327
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:28,400
carried instead of taking digitalis?

328
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:35,770
-Only if the pain is exact like that, it goes here and there. In that case absolutely. They

329
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:48,690
can carry it and the angina and chronic angina you may see that it will relieve for several

330
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:58,820
months where the Nitroglycerin will relieve for 1 day, Latrodectus manctas will relieve

331
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:07,420
for several months. It's a better remedy than Nitroglycerin.

332
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:20,010
-You have to look under pain chest region of the heart and then you found out

333
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:25,380
extended to the left arm.

334
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:30,690
-It's the only remedy so you have to know...

335
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:53,910
There is a state of fainting, she was very pale and I touched the forehead and it's

336
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:59,000
perspiring and cold. What is the remedy?

337
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:25,580
Carbo Vegetabilis, first remedy, a state of collapse especially when there is a stomach

338
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:44,760
upset and the patient is needing fresh air. Put all these together quickly, computer wise.

339
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:55,050
It was a dramatic evening and we have to stop.
