1
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,520
-Let us see the boy.

2
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:39,670
-First he had treatment from me in 1984 with two remedies, then there was a big gap on

3
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:46,020
the treatment and nothing else until 1986.

4
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:57,580
It was an acute state, when he came in with chronic earache. It started about 1.30 am in that day.

5
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,570
He is very frightened, he is trembling, throwing his head around and screaming,

6
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:11,620
feverish and chilly, I gave him Arsenicum 1M.

7
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,320
-That is November on which year?

8
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,150
-1986.

9
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:26,630
You see also in all the cases that have been taken previously that there is enough

10
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:35,610
justification for the prescription many times. Therefore where is the truth?

11
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:44,120
There is one truth. There is the right remedy and that is the truth.

12
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:54,200
How we go about to get this information and that is where it comes the evaluation of the

13
00:01:54,300 --> 00:02:00,120
whole case, the analysis of the case. What do you understand by analysis?

14
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:05,040
By your analysis how many points you will take into consideration?

15
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:23,370
He takes.. worse cold, restlessness, drinks water, Arsenicum.

16
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:41,680
-I brought it back very quickly in 1M 24th of November, becoming again very exhausted...

17
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:47,670
He always complains about aches and pains, he collapses easily and he is worse when

18
00:02:47,770 --> 00:03:04,330
his mother is around. He yells, kicks things but he miscalculates sometimes.

19
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:23,170
-Wait a moment. He came to you for what reason initially?

20
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:27,010
What is the problem with the child, just give us an overview of the case.

21
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:31,170
-He has trouble at school, this has come later but he never completes any work, he needs

22
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:36,250
a tremendous amount of reassurance and encouragement.

23
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:44,420
In what he says, he says in trouble in school, never finishes any of his work and then he

24
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:53,920
says he needs a lot of encouragement.

25
00:03:54,020 --> 00:04:01,710
This "needs a lot of encouragement" is an assessment which he makes about the case.

26
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:07,190
Once you introduce an assessment of yours into the case, then you have mixed up the

27
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,100
case.

28
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:18,010
We find a logical thing. Why the child is not doing good at school?

29
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:23,000
Because he doesn't have a lot of encouragement.

30
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:31,170
But if you go and see the facts a lot of encouragement, the mother sits with him, she tries

31
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:36,340
to make him study, the father tries and the child still is not doing good at school.

32
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:44,250
The assessment is needs a lot of encouragement. Where it comes from?

33
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:49,750
Unless the child says encourage me, then you say it needs a lot of encouragement but

34
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:56,170
usually the assessment is the logical conclusion of something which explains, a logical

35
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,670
explanation.

36
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:03,760
-They sent him away in a different school.

37
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,080
-For retarded children?

38
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:19,000
-No, I think for difficult children, not retarded. He is also having trouble at home, he gets

39
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:25,670
into violence with his mother.

40
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:28,500
-What he does?

41
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,510
-He hits her, kicks.

42
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,250
-Swears?

43
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:38,080
-I don't know about swear.

44
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,210
-He becomes really violent?

45
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:59,630
-I'm not sure about that. He kicks doors and balcony.

46
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,570
-He can be really violent.

47
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:16,240
-Yes, his mother says if there is no real damage it is because he has miscalculated.

48
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:23,740
Do you see what we are doing? Explaining the symptoms away.

49
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:51,560
He breaks the doors, the idea is the force.

50
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:03,250
You don't see the explanation, you see the fact.

51
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:11,740
When I hear he broke the door, my god. To break a door by kicking the door, it's very

52
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,250
strong kick and you have to feel very strong.

53
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:23,080
Try to break one door, I challenge any of you to break one door by one kick, even if you

54
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:31,080
miscalculate. Nobody will be able to do it. Who can do it?

55
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:41,080
A person who is really mad, who is out of his mind and the power has arisen and so much

56
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:52,010
strong power that kicks the door and breaks it.

57
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,160
-How old is he now?

58
00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:11,080
-14, I think but we may see it.

59
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:21,830
Also I would like to say that people who present a case are not my students.

60
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:25,790
You cannot say, oh this is your student, what he has done? No.

61
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:35,170
I consider my students only those who have the diploma of the School.

62
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:39,280
This is the diploma of the School.

63
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:49,910
If they have that, then you can blame me that they are my students but not otherwise.

64
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:56,500
This man is the first time I see him but it doesn't matter even if I see him for third time.

65
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:04,080
People present cases in which they have made mistakes and in which they have not

66
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:09,250
and I don't want to blame but the idea came about,

67
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:16,330
 you see that my students are giving remedies this way.

68
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:24,430
 Because I presented in the seminar. No it's not true.

69
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:38,660
-He has miscalculated. He tries to avoid really damaging things but sometimes he does.

70
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:47,170
-By putting too much force. Tell me what remedies you prescribed already?

71
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:54,420
-I prescribed unfortunately within two and a half weeks the Arsenicum.

72
00:09:54,520 --> 00:10:00,920
-What about the first time, what was the remedy?

73
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:09,760
You gave something initially and then you prescribed another remedy before Arsenicum which was?

74
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,670
-Tuberculinum.

75
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:18,110
-And from your experience you have given three remedies,

76
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:21,850
 there was any reaction from these remedies?

77
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,340
-No, I didn't find any reaction and

78
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:30,420
for the first remedy in 1984 I didn't see the patient again

79
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:42,030
until September, so I wasn't sure about any reaction.

80
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:48,080
And with Tuberculinum I didn't find any change.

81
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:56,170
-The child comes mostly because he has problems with his personality and also in the

82
00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:05,780
school, where he cannot cope with the other children. His attention is slow or not at all?

83
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:15,200
-I think it is maybe OK, he needs encouragement, he is very easily discouraged by the

84
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,110
slightest thing going wrong.

85
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:26,250
-When he becomes violent it is only in his house with his mother and close persons or he

86
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:30,420
can become violent at school with the children?

87
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:35,690
-At school he can be slightly violent, he can hit the desk.

88
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,990
-But he never hits some of his colleagues?

89
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:49,080
-Not, as far as I know, I didn't ask about that.

90
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:53,840
-So he becomes violent exclusively with his mother or his father as well?

91
00:11:53,940 --> 00:12:00,360
-No, they are separated. Mother and father are separated for 7 years.

92
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:09,830
His father is a very violent, angry personality and the child saw a lot of that anger.

93
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:16,170
-Was any time that the child was left handed?

94
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:21,500
-I don't know.

95
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,830
-You can add some information, as we are talking.

96
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:45,420
If you feel that you have some information that is not spoken about, you can say about

97
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,860
that it is this.

98
00:12:48,960 --> 00:13:02,160
-OK. He doesn't like getting up in the morning and he doesn't like getting dressed.

99
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:07,080
You see he did not understand what I told him. I told him you can go now, bring the

100
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:14,830
patient and add any information. He does not listen.

101
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:24,080
If you don't listen, it's very difficult to become a homeopath.

102
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:31,250
-He didn't understand what you said.

103
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:35,530
-If he didn't understand me very well, he would say would you please tell me what exactly

104
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:38,940
you said?

105
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:44,080
-He doesn't have any close friends, he can't share his activities, he can't cope with the

106
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:54,670
responsibility having a friend playing, he is more like the gadget man, he can do tricks

107
00:13:54,770 --> 00:14:01,030
with electronics and circuits.

108
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:04,340
-What do you mean?

109
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:11,250
-He invented a circuit when you put a battery or something like that.

110
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:17,280
-He seems he has a special time for electrical things.

111
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:21,910
-He seems to be happy when he is the oldest child in the group.

112
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:31,420
If he has asked to do anything and they demand this made, he reacts with tension and fear and

113
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:45,500
shaking of the head and tears, like homework or tidying up although he likes order but

114
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,000
he is incapable of doing it.

115
00:14:51,100 --> 00:15:03,000
He twitches his fingers all the time and that's improved after Arsenicum.

116
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:23,750
This symptom it may be common to Arsenicum or to another 2,3 remedies, so the remedy

117
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:34,080
touches the symptom.

118
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:57,160
-He is sensitive to his mother new relationship with her boyfriend, which is somehow

119
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:10,830
difficult relationship and can't handle the boy very well.

120
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:17,500
The mother's new boyfriend finds it very difficult and the mother is very sensitive to having

121
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,180
a relationship with both.

122
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:38,080
He is critical to people in order to build himself up.

123
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:42,750
-He criticizes others in order to say I'm great?

124
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,890
-Yes.

125
00:16:48,680 --> 00:17:06,410
Since 1M he has been quiet and playing with lego he has been very tired.

126
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:20,500
He moans and in good mood he is very charmy.

127
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:34,080
He likes chicken and rice dishes, sausages and butter, baked. He likes sweets, peanuts,

128
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:51,670
 he dislikes fish and salad and ice cream.

129
00:17:54,410 --> 00:18:11,980
He is very chilly, he comes down every night because he can't sleep, he comes down in

130
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:24,310
tears, he is afraid of not being able to sleep and he is better with a cup of tea.

131
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:31,230
He can't throw anything away, he collects junk and he invents things. He loves order but

132
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:36,430
he is frightened in trying to tide up. He can't get out if he is cuddled.

133
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,680
He can hit.

134
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,480
-Hard?

135
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:46,000
-I don't know how hard if somebody tries to cuddle him.

136
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:58,170
But he loves tickle. He has become more open to affection since the Arsenicum and less

137
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:10,270
restless. Now at the moment for three days he gave up eating or very little.

138
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:19,630
He wants to go to different schools because he is not part of the class, his writing is very

139
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:29,430
tight and he never finishes any of his work at school.

140
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:35,200
-Can you tell him to come in?

141
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:54,720
You like it? Being a film star?

142
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:59,180
-Yes.

143
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:10,270
-Yes he does, he wants to be acting.

144
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:23,430
-Do you like acting? Do you know what is acting? Tell me.

145
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:25,960
-To play out.

146
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:31,050
-In a theater. So you like to be in a theater?

147
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:40,380
-Yes I like to be.

148
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:49,680
He gives me some information and the information for me is a little bit unclear.

149
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:55,930
Where is the problem, how deep is the problem, how serious is the problem?

150
00:20:56,030 --> 00:21:01,050
Definitely there are some personality disorders, some personality problems how deep and

151
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:04,600
how far are these problems?

152
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:12,430
He has given some contradictory information, as far as I'm concerned.

153
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:23,300
So immediately I try to find out the IQ of the child, how much he understands.

154
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:29,460
I'm asking whether he likes to act or not and he said yes.

155
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:34,850
Do you believe he likes to act?

156
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:42,940
No. He does not really understand at all what I'm asking. He understands the words

157
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:49,510
but he cannot make out why I'm asking all these questions. And what does it matter?

158
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:56,510
This is what is going on in him, it's not that I like acting.

159
00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:02,100
Which are the remedies that they like acting?

160
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:07,050
There are remedies with good contact with others.

161
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:19,430
They enjoy contact with others. If you see remedies, which are extrovert and desire for

162
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:23,140
company and you combine all these elements, you will see the remedies, which are

163
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:28,050
mostly like to act.

164
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:37,020
Causticum is one of these remedies, Phosphorus more than Causticum. Argentum

165
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:53,100
nitricum quite a lot, Nux vomica yes and Lachesis quite a lot, Platina.

166
00:22:53,200 --> 00:23:10,550
Palladium yes, not Aurum.

167
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,180
-Are you right handed or left handed?

168
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,100
-Right handed.

169
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,600
-He was left handed in the beginning?

170
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:23,130
-Yes.

171
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:49,520
-Very easy anger, explosiveness, wild, he gets very wild, he kicks.

172
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,680
-Usually kicks?

173
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:56,430
-Kicks and punches.

174
00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:05,890
-What happens when you come to that moment? Can you tell us?

175
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:27,100
-My brother is irritating me so much and I hit him not too much.

176
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,520
-You don't want really to kill him.

177
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,600
-No.

178
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,590
-Do you like him in a way?

179
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:38,360
-Yes.

180
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:43,850
-In one way you like him and in another way you want to hit him, especially when he

181
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:50,340
provokes you. What kind of provocation he can do to you?

182
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:56,020
-A nasty word

183
00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:14,220
-What happens inside you? Can you describe? Blood comes into your head? You feel

184
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:19,100
angry inside and then what you have to do? Attack him?

185
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,430
-Yes.

186
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:26,800
-And you kick him but not very hard. Do you try to control yourself?

187
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,190
-I can't really.

188
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:34,790
-Therefore you kick him but not very hard or you kick him as hard as you can?

189
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:38,020
-I kick him but not very hard.

190
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,350
-Then what he does? Is he older than you?

191
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:43,340
-He is younger.

192
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,850
-So he cannot fight against you.

193
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:51,600
-He is actually bigger.

194
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,390
-He fights back?

195
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:54,860
-Yes.

196
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,510
-So he kicks back sometimes?

197
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:00,520
-Yes.

198
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:05,130
-Who wins if they fight?

199
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:11,680
-I usually come and stop it.

200
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:20,180
-Does he attack you as well?

201
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:29,050
-Yes very hard. I get some very hard.

202
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:33,680
-Why do you do it to your mother? You can't control yourself?

203
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:39,010
-No.

204
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:56,430
What is important in this case is when you ask the mother and say what is the problem

205
00:26:56,530 --> 00:27:10,460
with this child? The answer comes it is aggressiveness. The child is very aggressive.

206
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:17,020
After that you cannot say it is aggressive but needs encouragement.

207
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:23,200
It's aggressive but it does not have enough affection, it is aggressive but you minimize the

208
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:28,940
meaning of the aggressiveness. How much aggressive? It doesn't matter why.

209
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:36,940
The measure is that he kicks the door and breaks it, that's the measure of aggressiveness

210
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:42,810
and you have to take that into consideration in your prescription.

211
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:49,350
They are going to minimize it by explaining it their way; it is so nice child, so sweet.

212
00:27:49,450 --> 00:28:01,110
You see how sweet he is? He is very sweet, very nice.

213
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:18,610
What is interesting in his character? I was impressed by one element in his character.

214
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:27,110
A nice kid that all of a sudden goes into explosion, no it's not that what I mean.

215
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:37,690
He looks at me. Why this should impress me? He looks when I'm asking.

216
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:46,860
-He said he can't control, so he is controlled.

217
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:53,190
-Most probably in one part of his mind he understands that he should not, in another part

218
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:57,310
he is unable to control and he does it.

219
00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:19,520
Yes but what else do you observe? An element in his character.

220
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:27,360
-He is dreaming, he is somewhere else.

221
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:40,440
-It is a child which is not 100% present in the discussion. He has a dreamy state, as if he

222
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:46,110
is answering in one level and he is thinking of something else in another level.

223
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:50,360
Do you see that?

224
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:59,360
He is like a very wise grown up man who looks very objectively upon a situation and

225
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:04,280
assess the situation on another level.

226
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:13,860
He gives me the impression of a very wise man, his answers are amazing.

227
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:23,020
His contact, his behavior is really bizarre.

228
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:30,170
Talking to the child in this way, I would never imagine that this child could come to this

229
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:41,510
stage. Do you imagine it? Does it give you any hint that this child is violent?

230
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:48,260
-No.

231
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:57,340
-Sometimes you are good boy or always you are like that?

232
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,840
-No.

233
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,340
-Sometimes you are sweet, nice?

234
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:09,510
-No I'm not sweet.

235
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:26,870
-He is sweet but he won't admit it. Your teachers say about that.

236
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:33,290
-You don't care about these remarks, did you like these remarks?

237
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:38,280
You are pleased when your mother says you are sweet?

238
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:44,040
-Just.

239
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:47,040
-What do you like mostly to do?

240
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:54,440
You see this child is not behaving normally. The mother says he is sweet and the child

241
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:03,640
says why do you say that? It's not a normal reaction of a child. This is a question of a

242
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:13,400
grown up. Why do you say that? Am I really sweet?

243
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:18,390
-What do you like mostly playing?

244
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:28,310
-My lego.

245
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:29,810
-What is a lego?

246
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:34,070
-It is a plastic toy that fits together lots of pieces.

247
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:36,560
-Oh yes. He likes to play with that?

248
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,730
-In fact he likes to play with electrical stuff.

249
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:49,230
-You like electrical? You are good in that? Do you like to be an electrician or a television

250
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:51,610
repairer?

251
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:57,490
-Yes I like.

252
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:09,400
-He likes inventing things, he is always making things.

253
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:19,570
If you ask him to do something which he is not interested in, he won't do it or he does

254
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:26,400
it very withdrawn, not finish it. Lot of work he doesn't finish, he becomes very exhausted

255
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:34,070
and weak and he can't cope.

256
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:37,230
-Do you wake him up?

257
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:39,730
-Yes and take a cup of tea.

258
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:42,970
-Does he ever have any nightmares?

259
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:52,120
-Not very often. He wakes up in the night and he comes to me.

260
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,780
-He came to you?

261
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:57,400
He sleeps upstairs.

262
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:04,740
He came down in a terrified state?
-Yes.

263
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,230
-Why?

264
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:13,480
-He wouldn't tell me at the time but in the car he said he thought somebody was in the

265
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:19,550
other side of his room.

266
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:24,260
-And then he found out that nobody was there and then you were terrified?

267
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,350
-Yes.

268
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:30,850
-Does he leave the light on in his room or he sleeps in darkness?

269
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:36,100
-It's pretty dark now, for years we kept a light on but now not. He has some light coming

270
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,600
from the window.

271
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,300
-No.

272
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:56,780
-Yes that's true, I leave the light that comes up the stairs.

273
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:05,900
-And you leave the light until he is asleep?

274
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,200
-Yes.

275
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,680
-But if he wakes up in the night and there is darkness, he is not afraid?

276
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:16,200
-Not usually, he used to be until quite recently.

277
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:38,010
-When he first came one of the things you mentioned was the nightmares.

278
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:41,360
 Used to be lot of them.

279
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:48,460
Here we have an important symptom but it changed.

280
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:57,360
We have to know whether it is a new picture or it is the same picture continuing without

281
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,220
that symptom.

282
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:13,230
-Can you describe what happened?

283
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:22,870
-When he was a baby, he would wake up and stay in terror throw himself on the left I couldn't

284
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:35,360
 hold him because he was too strong and I put him on the floor and when he finished that

285
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:39,600
I picked him up because he was always very frightened.

286
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:44,560
-When he came out his eyes were very frightened?

287
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,910
-He was shaken.

288
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:52,950
-And you would put him back, he could have a second one during the night?

289
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:57,040
-No, I would stay with him until he sleeps.

290
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:11,070
When he was terrified, he tried to climb to the wall.

291
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:28,770
Do you hear that? The child had nightmares in which he would wake up with scream and

292
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:35,810
would throw himself left and right, his mother would take the child and put him on the floor

293
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:48,770
to calm down and after some time she was able to calm him down and go to sleep again.

294
00:37:48,870 --> 00:38:02,110
But she said sometimes the irritation was so great that I would find him climbing walls,

295
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,680
trying to go through the walls.

296
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:25,540
Now I will try to confuse you.

297
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:31,940
If you are saying climbing walls and you had heard me saying the other day Belladonna

298
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:36,950
is climbing walls, I would mislead you by leading you there, like the patient is going to

299
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,230
mislead you.

300
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:44,040
He tells you a symptom which is Belladonna symptom. Let us say he said this.

301
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:49,880
In spite of that, that is the remedy.

302
00:38:52,380 --> 00:39:29,560
I want you to understand eventually where is the key, the focus, the center of gravity of

303
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:32,410
the case?

304
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:38,730
-The core of the case.

305
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:51,780
-This is the picture of George. Now take this away, it is still the picture of George.

306
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:59,880
This is a little detail it doesn't matter, still it is the picture of George.

307
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:05,070
Little details will change but the whole remains the same.

308
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:12,210
You say now that, that is another remedy, no.

309
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:23,620
It looks like this man but he wears a hat and George never wears a hat.

310
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:29,210
It doesn't matter, that day he just put on this hat. This is the idea.

311
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:39,230
The child will give information about another remedy later on, is this the remedy? No.

312
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:47,550
Because the main picture is this remedy. We turn again and again.

313
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:57,970
He used to be afraid of the dark, used to want light, now he does not.

314
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:26,130
-When his brother was sick, he came down in the night and told me Mathew is sick, went

315
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:28,480
back to bed.

316
00:41:56,230 --> 00:42:01,630
-How do you feel now? Calm inside or angry inside?

317
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:03,500
-Calm.

318
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,800
-Is it a good feeling or it is not a good feeling?

319
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,150
-In between.

320
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:29,140
-When you are in that state do you ever become suddenly, without any reason, angry?

321
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:40,110
-No, sometimes by a lesson.

322
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:41,950
-You don't like the lessons?

323
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:44,380
-No.

324
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,290
-You are divorced?

325
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:53,370
-Yes.

326
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:55,700
-In what age he was when you divorced?

327
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,550
-Five.

328
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:07,950
-Since he was one he had these nightmares. Did he hear some fights?

329
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:10,800
-Yes, his father...

330
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:17,030
Again the same story. The boy at the age of one starts with nightmares, it is not

331
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:18,900
accidental.

332
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:28,040
Most probably he saw a violent act in front of him taking place. His father is violent and in

333
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:34,050
the night he wakes up terrified with nightmares.

334
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:43,300
You see the remedy how it builds eventually up?

335
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:50,950
-Did he hear some fights?

336
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:58,120
-Yes, his father can get very angry and he was very angry.

337
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:06,120
In fact after the divorce his younger brother asked him why the father wasn't angry

338
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:12,210
anymore and he... at that age, he used to get very angry sometimes.

339
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:30,200
But they used to be a lot of his father anger in the beginning of the night and it was after

340
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:35,300
we finished and go back to sleep, then he would wake up screaming.

341
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:40,210
Very often the two things came together.

342
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:47,400
It is very interesting phenomena, I just draw your attention to the fact, so you can observe

343
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:56,620
it, the moment we will be taking about things that really concern him deeply, he would go

344
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:04,620
into sleep. He becomes sleepy more and more. That means he does not want to face

345
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:11,300
what he has faced consciously, he lets everybody to the subconscious.

346
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:17,620
The moment these things are coming up, I'm going to sleep, I'm going to hear now again

347
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:21,470
and to remember what took place, now I'm going to sleep.

348
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:31,870
The Stramonium has to do that in order to survive because what it stayed in the subconscious mind

349
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:37,480
so aggressively, they feel they can kill somebody easily.

350
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:51,410
They talk about him, about symptoms...

351
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:59,630
He says when his father left I was very angry, he said to his younger brother, the first

352
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:01,470
thing he said.

353
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:11,130
But this child is a unique child, I will tell you why.

354
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:21,550
-Are you sleepy now?
-Yes I'm a bit tired.

355
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:31,880
-Why?
-He always is when we talk about him.

356
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:37,550
You see the mother? "He always is when we talk about him".

357
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,950
That's how the remedy picture is coming out.

358
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:51,790
How George knows the remedy? It is not my imagination. It is what I see only, I see it

359
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:58,290
again and again and I see it, I don't dismiss it. I see the child is sleeping.

360
00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:05,130
Why you are sleepy? What happened? I want to know, I have an idea but still I would like

361
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:07,730
to hear it.

362
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:17,470
What you see here you will never see in the Repertory.

363
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:32,710
-Even at school... He is very tired...

364
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:44,450
This was a few weeks ago I went to his teachers and so we expected him in school

365
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:53,200
Together... and after that I decided that... because it has been a suggestion that he should

366
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:58,550
leave that school and go away to a boarding school.

367
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:13,630
And I decided and I told him that I wouldn't send him away to another school.

368
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:17,230
And things got better after that.

369
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:23,130
Do you see where things have arrived with that school? They call and they say you better

370
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:29,330
take the boy away. This is a special school for problematic children. The child is not in a

371
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:30,380
normal school.

372
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:36,730
And from that school they call and say you have to take the child.

373
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:44,370
It cannot stay in the school. It is not a school for complete retarded children but for

374
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:50,470
children who are really having personality problems.

375
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:58,110
And the mother promised him whatever it happens, she will keep him at home, she will

376
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:03,290
not send him to another school for retarded children.

377
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:07,780
Because already the school in which he is, it is a school for children who are kind of

378
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,970
retarded.

379
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:18,620
-I didn't understand. Did you say that the sleepy is characteristic of Stramonium?

380
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,980
-Yes the sleepy is characteristic of Stramonium.

381
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:32,230
Not all Stramoniums will have that but we'll see it in several cases.

382
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:49,820
I said Stramonium are sweet children, they don't appear wild as they are described in our

383
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:57,820
books, the aggressiveness comes from time to time and it is uncontrollable.

384
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:04,030
But he says he tries to control. It doesn't matter what he says. Of course he tries to

385
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:09,040
control, of course he understands that if he kicks too hard, he may kill his mother and he

386
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:15,540
does not want to do that. Part of his mind knows it but he kicks too hard and this is

387
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,540
important.

388
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:25,140
And yet these children are sweet children, lovable, you love them.

389
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:32,140
Is he aggressive at all? Do you think he is aggressive? No.

390
00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:38,780
He answers but he says problems in the school, they say they have to take the child

391
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:45,670
away, even in a school which is for problematic children.

392
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:56,390
-I wouldn't send him away to another school.

393
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:08,290
-So you are sleepy now. You want to go to sleep? Can you sleep while you sit there?

394
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:10,560
-No.

395
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:21,470
-When he became violent, at what age he started hitting others?

396
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:24,570
-In the second year at school.

397
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:28,620
-Does he fight with his classmates?

398
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:29,960
-He used to, didn't you?

399
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:31,660
-Yes.

400
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,400
-Did you ever hit somebody very hard?

401
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:38,370
-Yes I can hit but they hit twice as hard.

402
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:46,160
-They hit you back and then what you did? You became more cross?

403
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:48,370
-I became more cross.

404
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:49,650
-And you hit them back again?

405
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:51,200
-Yes.

406
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,540
-Did you ever hit anybody very badly?

407
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,290
-No.

408
00:51:55,390 --> 00:52:03,950
-Did you ever hit anything, a door or a table, you broke anything?

409
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:10,390
-A couple of doors.

410
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:20,790
Do you see? I know the information whether he has broken doors.

411
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:26,290
I ask him and he does not know I know the information.

412
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:33,040
He says now this is gone too far. If I tell I broke doors, he may think I'm a bad boy now.

413
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:40,290
And then he hesitates to tell it. But this is the human being, this is where you reach a point

414
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:46,640
where you see the hesitation and you understand something is behind that.

415
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:08,460
-At home he actually does less damage. When he kicks the chairs, there is thought on

416
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:11,620
how he kicks them because he could damage them much worse.

417
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:12,870
So there is something in him...

418
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:19,160
-But what about his leg? Hitting a chair is not an easy thing. He does not complain about

419
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:20,410
his leg afterwards?

420
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:22,130
-No.

421
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:25,210
-He is very hard. Did you ever hit him?

422
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:28,210
-Yes I have done.

423
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:30,540
-He seems to feel the pain?

424
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,130
-Yes he does.

425
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:37,470
-His father hit him ever?

426
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:43,620
Now normally the child at that state when I say the father did he ever hit him, the child

427
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:54,130
normally is going to sleepy state. Not now maybe he will not do it but this is the idea

428
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:56,320
behind.

429
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:13,060
Also if you are very observant, you will see the change in the emotions.

430
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:25,790
There is some light in his eyes. Did his father hit him? The light goes away from his eyes

431
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:31,400
and becomes sad. Just put it backwards, watch that.

432
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:46,210
-Not when he was little. I remember one night when he was in a frightened state, he

433
00:54:46,310 --> 00:54:52,770
shook him, for god shake stop this.

434
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:43,480
His father anger is against himself.

435
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:58,380
After we split up, his father hit other people but he didn't hit us.

436
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:01,020
Has he ever hit you when you stayed with him?

437
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,370
-No.

438
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:27,880
-When he is in this anger, does his face becomes very red or white?

439
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:35,880
-It doesn't get red now as it used to. One time at school, I gathered from the other children

440
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:46,890
he was actually...  he didn't say anything. He does not get so red now. Sometimes...

441
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:56,790
-Does he have a lot of problems with his ears?

442
00:56:56,890 --> 00:56:59,130
-No.

443
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:02,980
-Does he get easily acutes?

444
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:08,710
-He gets weak and pain, it comes and goes.

445
00:57:08,810 --> 00:57:10,450
-But not real acute?

446
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:13,060
-No.

447
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:21,250
Again this is the same idea. Once the child is disturbed emotionally, he will not get any

448
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:24,220
serious acute condition.

449
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:41,710
-What about his sleep, is it constant? He talks in his sleep, he laughs in his sleep?

450
00:57:41,810 --> 00:57:49,560
-No, he doesn't seem anymore. He used to.

451
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:53,370
-Do you have any fears? Are you afraid of anything?

452
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:56,560
-No.

453
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:04,710
-You don't have fear of dogs or cats or thunderstorms?

454
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:07,060
-No.

455
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:18,710
-He used to be afraid to go upstairs on his own. But it's gone.

456
00:58:18,810 --> 00:58:20,710
-To stay in the night alone?

457
00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:26,960
-No, just even to go upstairs on his own. That stopped in the last year.

458
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:29,150
-Yes.

459
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:37,390
-So you don't like lesson in the school?

460
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:40,710
-Some I like.

461
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:48,960
Observe also the patterns. The child it seemed that the violence of the father came to

462
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:53,460
his subconscious fear, which appears during night. He wakes up in the night, throws

463
00:58:53,560 --> 00:59:03,710
himself and all that and as the child becomes more and more violent in his waking state,

464
00:59:03,810 --> 00:59:07,210
consciously, the other state in the subconscious subside.

465
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:13,460
The subconscious fears that in the night he will get up and he cannot stay in the dark and

466
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:21,540
he had nightmares etc. all this pattern subsides and then it comes real violence.

467
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:28,800
It's more to the conscious mind now but the remedy is the same.

468
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:35,400
The remedy has that first pattern and it has the second pattern of symptomatology.

469
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:39,550
Not because it changed the symptomatology we have another remedy now because we

470
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:48,800
see a certain symptomatology of the Stramonium child in the beginning, which develops

471
00:59:48,900 --> 01:00:00,150
eventually into violence. It is a child which is going worse and worse.

472
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:13,050
-What do you like?

473
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:17,220
-Wood work.

474
01:00:19,230 --> 01:00:24,710
-You don't have electrical things in the school?

475
01:00:24,810 --> 01:00:26,600
-No.

476
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,650
-All his electrical stuff is at home.

477
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:52,050
-This redness around his...

478
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:56,140
-It is strong sometimes.

479
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:04,150
-He is very sleepy now. Are you very sleepy now?

480
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:07,750
-Yes.

481
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:16,630
-So you want to finish with that examination to go home?

482
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:20,310
-Mmmm.

483
01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:35,210
He says yes in all that. He doesn't care, it is a cut off feeling, he does not feel

484
01:01:35,310 --> 01:01:40,730
uncomfortable, it is a feeling of being cut off, a feeling of being in a sleepy state where

485
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:43,310
you don't want anything.

486
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:53,400
-He is coming down too much, too quite.

487
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:01,540
Do you want a little bit of fight?

488
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:03,050
-No.

489
01:02:03,150 --> 01:02:05,040
-You feel very tired?

490
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:10,650
-Yes just about.

491
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:17,300
-Are you happy? Do you know happiness?

492
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,840
-Yes.

493
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:21,130
-Are you ever happy?

494
01:02:21,230 --> 01:02:23,150
-Sometimes.

495
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:26,880
-When is these times?

496
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:30,500
-When I will do something good.

497
01:02:32,810 --> 01:02:38,550
-And they praise you, they say very good. What you did was very good.

498
01:02:38,650 --> 01:02:39,550
Then you feel very happy?

499
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:41,650
-Yes.

500
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:53,740
-Is he intolerant of heat or cold, things like that you have noticed?

501
01:02:54,490 --> 01:02:57,390
-He feels the cold.

502
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:08,240
When he gets too hot, he gets a little bit depressed.

503
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:34,240
-When he is at home is he a talkative person or a quite person?

504
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:38,600
-It depends on what he is doing.

505
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:46,960
He goes on his own and makes things and he is upset if you can't see it immediately.

506
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:52,800
He comes when I'm cooking and he wants me to see it straight away.

507
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:56,300
-And then he becomes violent?

508
01:04:05,850 --> 01:04:09,750
What about water? How is his relationship with water?

509
01:04:09,850 --> 01:04:14,050
He washes himself frequently? He likes water?

510
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:17,250
-He likes to play with it.

511
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:23,210
-If he has a shower and you put water over his head?

512
01:04:23,310 --> 01:04:30,800
-He used to get in a great state, if you would water his head, he would scream, he couldn't

513
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:35,400
bear it in his eyes.

514
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:54,300
He used to complain very violently about that but that it has gone better because now he

515
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:58,150
complains about doing it himself.

516
01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:07,550
-Does he pour water over his head and the water would run over his face?

517
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:09,630
-Yes.

518
01:05:09,730 --> 01:05:11,600
-You don't mind now?

519
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:13,690
-No.

520
01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:32,900
-Has he ever broken any glassy thing, any window, anything which shines, like mirror?

521
01:05:36,650 --> 01:05:39,150
-No.

522
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:41,750
-Are you sure?

523
01:05:41,850 --> 01:05:44,700
-Yes.

524
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:53,800
Somebody throwed a shoe through a window but that was a mistake, he didn't want to go

525
01:05:53,900 --> 01:06:05,400
through the window. Some years ago, that's the only time it happened.

526
01:06:15,650 --> 01:06:22,810
-Does he like dancing? Music?

527
01:06:22,910 --> 01:06:26,740
-He likes the music but he wouldn't dance.

528
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:39,340
-He is going to sleep, completely relaxed.

529
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:43,150
Do you like that we talk about you? Do you enjoy it?

530
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:47,320
-Not particularly.

531
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:53,550
-What we say about you do you feel embarrassing?

532
01:06:53,650 --> 01:06:56,160
-No.

533
01:06:56,650 --> 01:07:03,000
-But do you like that we are talking about so long you and we take a long time to sort out

534
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:08,750
what is going on inside you? Do you appreciate that?

535
01:07:08,850 --> 01:07:12,160
-I don't mind.

536
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:28,750
-He has reacted strongly in the past. A lot of anger comes out later.

537
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:33,480
I think this time he is retreating.

538
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:37,890
-But the anger will come tomorrow most probably.

539
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:39,820
-Maybe yes.

540
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:56,850
Most probably what is happening with these children is that they are very impressionable.

541
01:07:56,950 --> 01:08:05,840
Impressions can make a big event but they don't protect themselves during impression.

542
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:17,460
The let the impression come in without filtering... and then later on it creates disturbances.

543
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:23,370
-I'm tired.

544
01:08:23,470 --> 01:08:40,310
-He is very sleepy. He is very nice after all this.

545
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:46,520
Something happens inside you that we cannot control. This adrenaline comes up and it is

546
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:51,110
too much and it has to...

547
01:08:54,110 --> 01:08:57,510
-At school they are not so worried about that, they are more worried about the fact that he

548
01:08:57,610 --> 01:09:03,610
is actually a bright child but he is not keeping up with the work at all.

549
01:09:04,110 --> 01:09:10,510
As soon as he meets a problem, he can't' handle it, he is in panic, he becomes frightened

550
01:09:10,610 --> 01:09:15,150
really and he becomes exhausted.

551
01:09:26,380 --> 01:09:30,800
-He plays with his hands a lot now.

552
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:37,040
-He is relaxed actually. Some years ago he had a nervous cough, it wouldn't stop and

553
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:45,450
then he was doing that all the time, nonstop. He was writing and he puts the pen down to

554
01:09:45,550 --> 01:09:51,050
do that and then stopped. Isn't it?

555
01:10:19,050 --> 01:10:21,200
-Anything else?

556
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:32,800
-No. It's difficult to say.

557
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:37,620
-He is very nice. Everyone likes him?

558
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:43,500
-I think they do, at school the children want to know what is wrong with him.

559
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:53,450
He plays by himself quite a lot, he doesn't join the crowd very easily.

560
01:10:53,550 --> 01:10:57,390
-Does he play with his genitals?

561
01:10:58,650 --> 01:11:04,870
-No. They do it in the bath both of them.

562
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:06,370
-Not constantly?

563
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:08,370
-No.

564
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:10,620
-When he is angry does he swear?

565
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:13,800
-Yes a lot.

566
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:20,700
-He uses bad words. What words does he use?

567
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:25,140
-He calls me bitch and he tells everyone to fuck off.

568
01:11:30,650 --> 01:11:32,640
-Yes?

569
01:11:36,550 --> 01:12:00,950
-In acutes he becomes very frightened. He is very afraid of being ill any and over reacts to

570
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:15,370
any pain. He is afraid of pain and afraid of having temperature and that disorientated

571
01:12:15,470 --> 01:12:17,470
feeling.

572
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:34,810
-He feels as if he is standing up, when he is lying in bed.

573
01:12:50,050 --> 01:12:51,810
-Thank you.

574
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:10,850
I would like to make a remark now concerning Stramonium.

575
01:13:15,380 --> 01:13:26,290
I would say that I find Stramonium in late years much more indicated than in my first years

576
01:13:26,390 --> 01:13:27,900
of practice.

577
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:41,780
I don't know whether I learned to recognize it more easily or whether there is really a

578
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:53,290
development of aggressiveness in our societies and we have the appearance of more and

579
01:13:53,390 --> 01:14:00,040
more of such remedies, as Stramonium, Hyoscyamus, Nux vomicas.

580
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:03,790
You see the Nux vomicas were always very prominent.

581
01:14:03,890 --> 01:14:15,040
The aggression that creates problems in the human body were taken away mostly by

582
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:24,380
Nux vomica. Today we have much more aggressive remedies being indicated and also

583
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:40,740
we have remedies which cover pictures of drug abuse.

584
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:07,190
Also what I want to show you again is the time that you have to wait.

585
01:15:07,940 --> 01:15:13,440
Remember Bill Gray left his cases for two years, returned and found them all cured.

586
01:15:14,190 --> 01:15:19,580
Maybe there is a little bit of exaggeration in that but stick that in your mind.

587
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:25,300
You gave a good remedy, there was a good reaction, leave it alone, don't repeat it, don't

588
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:28,190
give other remedies. This is the idea.
