1
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,200
-Very short after I feel very weak, tired...

2
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:41,710
-Just a moment what happened? Last time you had what?

3
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,950
-You mean after the remedy.

4
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:49,530
-You took China 200 and then after that?

5
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:57,380
-After a quarter, 20 minutes I had a reaction, very strong reaction.

6
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,780
-Can you describe?

7
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:09,490
-Yes. It's starting in the back and something happened and then I feel very tired,

8
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:21,950
exhausted and it gets worse and worse like I nearly fell asleep. It was like getting a

9
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:38,950
drawing sensation, forward that I had to lay on the table and I think I would prefer to go

10
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:48,750
out but I was afraid if I couldn't walk. So I waited and in the end I tried to go out.

11
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:59,900
I felt like I was drunk and outside I had to sit down because I don't feel to stand and

12
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,280
after that I came in here.

13
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:09,000
-After that we pick you up from there and we put you in bed here.

14
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:18,060
-I feel the same sensation, I lie on my stomach and it feels like I was drawing down

15
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:28,060
all the time and so heavy feeling that I had to move to get out from here but in a way I couldn't.

16
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,780
-You could not move.
-So weak and so helpless.

17
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:42,310
-Then what happened?
-I cried in here I think.

18
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,160
-You think, you cried a lot.

19
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,840
-I was like this for 20 min, half an hour, I'm not sure about that.

20
00:02:52,940 --> 00:03:01,910
-At least half an hour you cried there and slowly you started coming back.

21
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:09,140
-Yes and somebody was driving me back to the hotel and I was very exhausted

22
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,750
the rest of the day.

23
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:21,650
When I came back home I was very tired, exhausted feeling for a couple of weeks,

24
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:34,140
3-4 weeks, very little energy, very tired, feel like I don't want to go to work at all.

25
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,990
-Did you sleep all the time?
-No. I don't sleep.

26
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:48,150
The sleep is not better. I had the same at night time, I wake up the same time

27
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,830
between 3.30 and 4.

28
00:03:53,330 --> 00:04:05,730
Sometimes I could sleep 5 hours but mostly it was 3.5-4 hours and I was very bloated

29
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,330
more than before.

30
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,730
I always have been that for 20 years but it is more.

31
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:17,830
From the morning a little bit and worse after eating and worse and worse during the day.

32
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:37,480
Then I go to Cyprus, it was very hot there and I have noticed that before,

33
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:45,480
in very hot summer my sleep is better. I could sleep in the morning to 11 o'clock,

34
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,560
if I want to and I do that.

35
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:53,550
-You went there for holidays?
-For 2 weeks and I sleep there.

36
00:04:53,650 --> 00:05:03,550
-What exactly the time was there?
-20th of July and there I can sleep.

37
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,800
-And there you slept quite a lot.

38
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:13,400
-But at the same time, the same day we went back and I stop eating farinaceous food.

39
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:23,400
No bread, no potatoes and feel much better, slowly better in the stomach.

40
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,050
-And what did you eat?

41
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:38,250
-I eat vegetables and I could eat fruits, before I couldn't I was so bloated from it.

42
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:46,980
But because I don't take the other stuff, I could eat fruit and I eat some meat but meat

43
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:52,470
and vegetables, fish and vegetables, no rice, potato, bread.

44
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,670
-You avoided farinaceous food.

45
00:05:54,770 --> 00:06:03,670
-Yes but all this time my constipation is no better. I have it from my childhood

46
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:10,420
and it's thesame, even worse here in Alonissos because always in Alonissos it's better

47
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,020
but not this time.

48
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:27,070
I always had it from very small.

49
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:34,470
-But you didn't say after that what happened?

50
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:47,650
-I drink much less too but if I eat a little bit more heavy I'm more thirsty again.

51
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,570
-During eating?

52
00:06:51,670 --> 00:07:00,830
-After eating because it always is aggravating about eating much and eating heavy.

53
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:10,320
If I eat very little, very light food, no. The stomach is good but not the constipation.

54
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:20,730
If I drink alcohol, then I drink a lot. One glass or two glasses of water

55
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:31,220
and one little sweet I need a whole glass of water and I'm more stiff in my shoulders.

56
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:36,220
I've been this for many years too, especially the right, on the right side of the neck

57
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:48,220
and down on the right arm. So I can hardly write, aggravates very much writing

58
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,070
and to carry just a little bottle or something...

59
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:56,570
-It's painful?
-It's painful and very stiff.

60
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:08,720
And I have pain on the right knee, I had it before, if I go upstairs I have that for many years.

61
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:28,080
It's the same but I've always been allergic to metal and for some years, any metal.

62
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,330
-You have been allergic if you touch it?

63
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:38,070
-Yes I get an eruption very much and I had to avoid it but for some years I noticed

64
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:42,430
it was a little bit better but now it's worse again.

65
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:51,330
I noticed because I get a new thing and I put it on, it was very beautiful and I couldn't have it.

66
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:56,430
It was very much the skin eruption.

67
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:14,580
In Cyprus I get ulcers in the right side here, I get that for many many years too,

68
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:20,580
always in the summer but for some years it has been a little bit better, not so much

69
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,030
but it grows faster.

70
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:29,160
But this time it would not grow and I had to take it, to do something or going into a big part

71
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:34,410
if it was so terrible and I put Mercury D13.

72
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,360
-You took Mercurius.

73
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:43,160
-Yes, it didn't help for 2-3 days, nothing and I took 200 and in 2 days it was gone.

74
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:54,160
But I don't know when, I think it was in the beginning of August but I'm not sure about

75
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:59,840
something that happened after that but I can't sleep at home too.

76
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,130
That is important I nearly forget it.

77
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:12,580
After Cyprus I sleep or maybe after Mercurius because I took it in the end of the vacation

78
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:19,930
or in the beginning coming home, so I sleep very good.

79
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:34,430
I had noticed that if, sometimes I take a little bread, if I'm in a party and eat a little bit

80
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:43,880
of farinaceous I notice that I sleep and I wake again in the middle of the night.

81
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,330
-Potatoes you can not take?

82
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:50,660
-No, I don't think so, I feel that's bad too.

83
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,120
-How is that you did not mention that before?

84
00:10:54,220 --> 00:11:01,080
-I had tried several years to avoid milk products and that helped me.

85
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:07,580
-No, you have said you have flatulence from milk and flatulence from fruit also.

86
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,510
-Yes but not flatulence but bloated.

87
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:21,780
-But you did not mention any problems with farinaceous food before.

88
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,490
So you found out after China that you were?

89
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:32,740
-I've always mistaken it but the tests you take with the doctor didn't show anything wrong

90
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,090
with wheat or something.

91
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:43,490
-I'm asking you, forget the doctors, before you had problems with farinaceous food

92
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:44,990
or you don't know?

93
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:52,510
-I know because all that stuff, pancakes, all that things always aggravating

94
00:11:52,610 --> 00:12:04,340
but I wasn't sure about it, if it was the milk or the farina, the wheat.

95
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:13,490
Because that kind of food I didn't eat, I can't eat it since I was in the 20,

96
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:22,930
I couldn't eat that. I like it very much as a child but I try to avoid it.

97
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:49,080
I'm a little more relaxed, a little more concentrated but I need more relaxing

98
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:53,830
and more concentrating because it is very bad, really very bad.

99
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:59,080
I can concentrate for a while and then my thought is completely far away

100
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:03,680
and I try to get in it again and I miss.

101
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:20,330
I think I'm too hurry and restless, always have to be occupied, I don't like to sit down,

102
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,260
I can't really relax.

103
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:29,340
-Any other complains?

104
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:49,780
-I have not so many fears but I have a little bit of claustrophobia.

105
00:13:52,130 --> 00:14:06,030
For many years I have desire diving but I haven't done it. Before July now in Cyprus, I do it.

106
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:18,430
I take a course and  the last time you had to dive in caves, very small and I did it.

107
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:24,180
-So it is better.
-Yes I think it's a little better.

108
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:35,180
I'm more relaxed in the mountain, always in a mountain and on a boat, in the sea.

109
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:48,660
And I'm still mostly warm but sometimes could freeze a little bit more and if I exercise

110
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,760
I always perspire very much, lots of perspiring.

111
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,110
-Lots of perspiration with exercise.

112
00:14:55,210 --> 00:15:03,690
-But I get very easily chilly again, if the other in the group want to open the window

113
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:10,160
because they are perspiring, I get chilly very easily again, I have to put on clothes.

114
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:18,910
-But you remember a symptom that you have said that you are chilly after anger?

115
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:26,010
-Yes. But I haven't been angry so I don't know.

116
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:33,510
-But you did not say anything about your main complain that was cough.

117
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,010
-It's gone.

118
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:42,080
-It's gone. Why don't you mention it? You think it's ...?

119
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,680
-I think it's the first thing.

120
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,930
-You take it for granted.
-No, it's very, very good.

121
00:15:52,430 --> 00:16:02,660
-You say one good thing also for your follow up, otherwise I was prepared to give you

122
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,010
the wrong medicine.

123
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:12,690
-Oh no but of course this season now, the autumn, winter is always worse

124
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:17,490
but it has been a little bit cold here and I haven't cough.

125
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:23,090
I used to do that, so I think that's very, very much better.

126
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:37,830
-Also you have said that your stool was bloody sometimes.

127
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:42,660
-Yes at that time, the last time here it was for some days.

128
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,410
-You never had it again?
-No, it has gone away.

129
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:49,910
-But you forgot to mention this also. It was not important.

130
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:58,260
-I have a little about bit. I got a little lump air induration here, I had it the last time too.

131
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,160
-But what has to do with the blood in stool, do you think it comes from that?

132
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:05,290
-No, I have no blood in stool.

133
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:15,740
-You sleep is good? Just give me an idea. You go to bed, you fall asleep and

134
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:20,690
you wake up in the morning, you don't wake up in between at all?

135
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,790
-Sometimes very seldom.

136
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:29,990
-And when you wake up in the morning you feel refreshed from sleep?

137
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,580
It's good that you have slept.

138
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:36,260
-If I have slept 8 hours, I feel refreshed.

139
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:48,490
-Your energy is good, you are happy with your energy that you have now or you want more energy?

140
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:57,700
-In the evening I can't do mental work at all, mentally no energy.

141
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,780
-Which is the worse hours for you?

142
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:16,180
-I don't have time to feel so much during the day time, if I sit in course here

143
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,540
I feel tired about.

144
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:29,100
No, I think it's about 2 o'clock but I'm not in course here, so I didn't notice so much.

145
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:36,350
I'm on the beach here and at home when I work but in the evening it comes when I sit

146
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:40,850
down. After 9 when I sit down, then...

147
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:48,350
-OK, also you had said that in the morning on waking you had a kind of depression.

148
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:50,850
-Yes I had very much depression.

149
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:53,100
-Now?
-No.

150
00:18:53,200 --> 00:19:00,380
If very seldom I wake on 3 or 4 I can have a little thing but it's very little.

151
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:15,600
So that's very much better and quite energy physical, I exercise more than the last time.

152
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:21,600
-Do you still like sweets?
-I didn't like sweets.

153
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,870
-You had aggravation from sweets?
-Yes.

154
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:28,100
-You still say you have aggravation from sweets?
-Yes I have.

155
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:35,350
-And also from warm covering of the head you had aggravation. Do you still have that?

156
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:39,550
-I think it's a little bit better but I still don't want.

157
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:45,570
I bought a cabriolet this June because I want my head not warm.

158
00:19:52,500 --> 00:20:00,500
I want fresh air for the head but I think it's a little bit better maybe, I'm not sure.

159
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:04,720
Warm cars is terrible.

160
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:23,370
-Do you have any salivation during sleep?
-No.

161
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,720
-OK, let's go inside.

162
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:58,390
I want to say about the follow up that you have to be careful because many times

163
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:10,450
I have made mistakes because you don't go thoroughly through the case or you don't remember

164
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:15,280
what was the problem and the patient comes and has several complains,

165
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:21,030
which he gives you the complains and then you tend to give a prescription for the complains

166
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:27,000
and then the confusion starts.

167
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:36,450
This could be exactly that type of case where they don't give the overall picture,

168
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:42,280
they don't know what is going on where lots of others symptoms are going on

169
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:47,110
and you don't know really what the remedy has done.

170
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:58,940
Anyhow we clarified that, that is one thing. The second thing, I took care of the reaction

171
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:09,980
which she had. It was one of the most quick and most dramatic reactions from a remedy of 200

172
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:19,430
where she was really collapsing, from one moment to the other. She took the remedy

173
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:29,520
and then we put her on the table and then she was crying and crying,

174
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:32,520
I didn't know why of course.

175
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:46,690
This was a quick reaction, I said OK very good, things are doing well.

176
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:53,840
When you see this reaction always the remedy is going to act, there is no way.

177
00:22:53,940 --> 00:23:05,510
Unless of course it is a hysterical reaction, which is different.

178
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:15,290
Maybe a hysteria is coming because they also may be crying and acting in a hysteric way

179
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:18,680
but she is down to earth actually too much.

180
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:22,020
She was even coming more down with the remedy.

181
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:40,420
She is not the hysteric one and the reaction it was quick and quite strong and I said OK,

182
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,610
that's going to be very good.

183
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:54,610
Coming out to the situation, what shall we do at this moment?

184
00:23:56,610 --> 00:24:01,610
She has a sensitivity towards the farinaceous food, she says.

185
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:06,690
Before, what happened with the Mercury?

186
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:32,090
I don't like it because the general idea is one is starting breaking out, you will be surprised

187
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:46,170
how much relief can bring out a blister. I have seen terrible headache, chronic headache

188
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:54,270
being relieved with Dulcamara when Dulcamara brought a herpes on the lips.

189
00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:14,330
For years, she took Dulcamara, in a few days the lips were full of herpes, which they broke up

190
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:23,760
and she was a woman, she was quite good looking and she did not like this idea and of course

191
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:31,590
I would not do anything. She says, do something about that, I don't like it and I say, I like it.

192
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:36,340
She says, I don't like it, OK I can not do anything.

193
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:44,920
She went to the pharmacy and put some cream there. As soon as it has gone,

194
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,270
the headache was back.

195
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:56,360
I said, OK now you want it? Yes I want it. Take again the remedy, it broke out again.

196
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:02,510
So you don't want suppressed these things and if you suppress them even

197
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:06,610
with homeopathic remedy, this is even worse.

198
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:17,960
You have to be lucky not to spoil the case. The patient may tell you, I have to go to a party,

199
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,670
you say this is what I can do.

200
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:25,010
This is the law, I can't break the law because you have to go to a party, you break the law

201
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:30,760
and you break it yourself. You go to the pharmacy, put whatever you like and then it's gone

202
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:34,770
and then OK. But I will not do it.

203
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:45,840
The fact that she sleeps is not because she went to Cyprus.

204
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:51,850
It's because the remedy started acting and she was sleeping normally.

205
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:59,750
Simply Mercury did not spoil the case and she would start again not sleeping,

206
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:01,630
which would be unfortunate.

207
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:15,830
Therefore now at this moment, she gives certain symptoms which produce the picture of a remedy,

208
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:17,130
yes or no?

209
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:23,500
The symptoms she gives at the moment is flatulence from farinaceous food.

210
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,930
We look at this and we see 6 remedies there.

211
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:45,370
We see this is still a point where it will take a little bit more time before it is corrected.

212
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:54,940
So it may take to correct this point, to digest better farinaceous food, it may take let us

213
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,190
say another year, it doesn't matter.

214
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:09,440
The moment that you see she is better all around, you don't give Mercury or Natrum Carbonicum

215
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:24,100
because she had... she has aggravation from milk, flatulence and I can not imagine,

216
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:29,700
I'm going to find this rubric, perhaps I'm going in my Repertory and I'll find it.

217
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,950
I can not imagine this is not here.

218
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:40,200
I have to find it, I go especially for that in the interval.

219
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:57,200
So no remedy, she has to continue not to take any remedy and not to take any coffee of course.

220
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:14,750
-A year ago you got China, what potency?
-C200.

221
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,740
-And you had a big reaction.

222
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:32,510
-And I was very exhausted after for a long time, very tired and the cough much better.

223
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:47,250
But now it's better to talk about now. The cough is very good, it's not there.

224
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:55,230
A few times just by cigarette smoke but nothing, so it's another problem that I have,

225
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:58,730
I told you about before, that's my stomach.

226
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:04,830
-Your stomach.
-Very much bloatedness and constipation.

227
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:15,480
Constipation started when I was a child but the bloatedness started 20 years ago, I was 27,

228
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,590
after a holiday in Spain.

229
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:31,480
In some samples they found salmonella, the other 6 was OK but after that it started and

230
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:38,300
I was in a school situation at that time and from 10 o'clock every day I couldn't

231
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:48,300
lock my trousers I had them open. I had to wear sweater and it was for months and months.

232
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:57,220
Sometimes it's better, if I try some diet and that goes on for many years.

233
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:11,910
But last summer I mistake gluten, I'm allergic to gluten, it's in wheat, in flour.

234
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:24,330
So I avoided and nearly stopped. I got is sometimes in restaurant and I get very good.

235
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:30,890
I was so good and so happy, I thought I would continue.

236
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:44,130
I thought I found a solution in a way and one month ago I get the test and they said,

237
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:46,980
I'm allergic to gluten.

238
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:59,330
But before that I was in Tenerife in March and I seek for some food, I eat some sea food

239
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:06,800
and I get sick and vomiting and I get it sometimes before I go on holiday too.

240
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:16,050
I eat some snails and after a while I was not good, so I stopped eating but I get very sick.

241
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:22,050
After that it started again, bloatedness every day. A little bit from morning,

242
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:26,910
worse and worse during the day and in the evening very, very big.

243
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:34,800
And the constipation for several days and then may be one day I can go several times,

244
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:45,150
it gets softening, the stool. If I go several times one day.

245
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:57,380
I'm constipated for many days and then I can go for one day.

246
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:08,220
-You mean 3-4 days no stool, then you go for stool, then it's better the day after?

247
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,260
-Yes 1-2 days and then it starts again.

248
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:26,500
-What about the gluten? You said you avoided the gluten but you avoided and you still

249
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:35,720
avoid? So why you attribute the better in the avoiding of the gluten, I don't understand.

250
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:49,070
-I was very good but after the holiday in March it started again but I'm still avoid gluten.

251
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:52,420
-So you didn't change this, you don't take gluten now.

252
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,600
-No.

253
00:33:55,580 --> 00:34:01,720
-And the constipation is the same as before? The same type?

254
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:10,970
-Yes the same. It can change a little bit but many years ago I was constipated

255
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:20,650
for 1 or 2 weeks but I try to take something for it and not school medicines, but from herbs.

256
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:25,150
-Now you don't take herbs?
-No.

257
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:47,920
-Before you took laxatives herbs but after China you stopped taking herbs

258
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:55,690
or after a few months after China? When did you stop taking herbs?

259
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:02,470
-From last summer when I stopped gluten.

260
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:16,980
-From last summer you did not take anymore herbs and you had some bloody stool.

261
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,730
Now still you have?

262
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:24,580
-No, it was just some days, it was nothing special.

263
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:29,580
-What about sleeplessness.

264
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:42,230
-I sleep very good, after last summer I went away from gluten, I sleep every night 8 hours.

265
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:43,610
-Gluten again.

266
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:54,930
-I tried to take after this vacation because I was so bad and feel it  was some bacteria

267
00:35:55,030 --> 00:36:03,680
I tried to take Arsenicum C200, do nothing and then I wait for 6 days

268
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:08,030
and I try to take China C200 again, do nothing.

269
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:12,280
-What else you took?
-Nothing else.

270
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:40,010
-Do you still take sweets?

271
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:45,370
-I need a little bit after meal, more than before.

272
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:51,010
-Do you have an aggravation?
-Yes, so I try to avoid it.

273
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:57,730
-What kind of aggravation?
-I feel without energy and then very tired.

274
00:36:57,830 --> 00:37:03,830
And the same with alcohol, in very short time I get tired.

275
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:09,810
-When you wake up in the morning, you feel good?
-No, I feel tired.

276
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:17,750
I can sleep 8 hours but I feel still tired, not refreshed.

277
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:27,750
Sometimes but mostly not refreshed and I get very tired if I study.

278
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:33,980
We have a group in Norway, we study together, the other can go for hours and hours but

279
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:39,980
I'm exhausted after a few hours, really exhausted, I have to lie down, I can't think,

280
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:48,730
I'm very tired and in the evening I'm very tired, after 8 o'clock, 8.30 so tired that

281
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:50,360
I can go to bed.

282
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:55,080
-Which is the worst time for you?

283
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:02,480
-It can be in the middle of the day too but if you work you can't notice it like that

284
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:08,660
but in the evening when I sit down.

285
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:13,810
-What time is this?

286
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:22,910
-Usually before 8 I do something always exercise or work. After 8.

287
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:37,710
-You have mentioned a symptom that if you get angry you have a chill.

288
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:39,050
-Yes that's true.

289
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,130
-It's still there?
-It's still there.

290
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:59,390
But I think I put a little more clothes now because I'm nearly warm.

291
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:16,040
-Are you very angry? Are you irritable?

292
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:26,290
-No, I think I was much more before Tuberculinum. I think Tuberculinum took away

293
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:44,120
some of it but I can be more impatient, if things are very slowly. I'm quite hurry.

294
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:59,300
I have energy if I exercise, if I work, move, I have energy very much and I'm always warm,

295
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:13,830
I want to do lots of several things, skiing, roll blade, everything, I want to do things.

296
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:22,450
So sometimes I avoid studying because I always get tired on studing.

297
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:29,050
-You do too much?
-Yes better physical things.

298
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:38,710
-Are you still in a hurry inside you?
-It's better.

299
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:46,410
I think China has to do a lot with that, so I'm very glad of that, besides the cough

300
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:47,870
I'm very glad of that.

301
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:50,370
-So psychologically you feel better?

302
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:55,880
-In what respect? Can you describe how it was before, what is now?

303
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:58,470
How is the difference?

304
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:05,470
-I didn't think so much about what the others said and mean about me.

305
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:16,620
I'm more organized and not that hurried. I can be more by myself, I like it,

306
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:23,870
so for many days it's OK, I feel I need it because I'm so tired, I'm exhausted,

307
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:32,390
I feel I need it. I feel I need a year free from work and everything

308
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:40,620
because I feel so exhausted in a way. I feel to dosomething else.

309
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,450
-You like really to be by yourself now?

310
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:59,450
-Not by myself all the time, I want love in my life but I will try to go away to another

311
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:04,710
country and do something else. I'm planning for it, so we will see.

312
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:13,700
-Energy you have more than before, now?
-No.

313
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,730
-Same or less?

314
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:27,650
-I think I have less energy the whole of me because I always do things but now

315
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:37,820
I can't do so much anymore and I have to sit down or lie down. But just for a short time.

316
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:43,450
-I don't remember, are you married?
-No.

317
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:45,450
-You are divorced?

318
00:42:45,550 --> 00:43:06,960
-No, the first time I lived together with a man I quit it. I'm not married.

319
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:16,200
-You were living with a man. What do you mean the first time? The first time you came here?

320
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:24,540
-No, it was ended before I come here. I told you about it. He was much younger than me

321
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,670
and I told you a little bit about that.

322
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:32,170
-But before you had not been married?
-Yes, two times.

323
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:44,040
-And then you had an affair that it broke out when you came here and after this

324
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:46,290
you have some new?

325
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:51,040
-I had been alone until this summer, so I have...

326
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:55,560
-This summer you mean the previous.
-Yes.

327
00:43:57,090 --> 00:44:01,960
-Then since that summer you have somebody that you are together.

328
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:10,950
-Yes we are together, I sell my house in December because I didn't want to own anything more,

329
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:17,210
so I wonder what shall I do, so I looked at apartments and think what shall I do

330
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:21,460
but I didn't want to do anything but I couldn't live in the street.

331
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:32,790
So in the end this boyfriend, he said to me why can't you live in my house, I travel so much,

332
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:39,540
you can be by yourself for a long time, so you can live, you don't need to press the situation

333
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:43,630
to buy something. And that is the situation now.

334
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:58,190
I feel very good in this house because I'm born in this area and I love the area

335
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:06,950
and I feel comfortable, he is very kind, he spoiled me but in a way I feel that I had to

336
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:12,300
do something before I decide what to do.

337
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:20,200
I live there but it's not the meaning that I should live there for ever,

338
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:24,540
it's a temporary situation until I decide what to do.

339
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,990
-How is your sexual desire?

340
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:40,950
-I think it's normal, 2-3 times the week, in vacation maybe more, free time.

341
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:50,450
-It's OK. Do you have any leucorrhea?

342
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:58,550
-No. I had when I was 14,15 very much but not now.

343
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:12,530
-When you were young did you have a sexual desire or the desire came much later?

344
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:23,280
-No I don't think the sexual desire was so much more but I feel more kissing

345
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:26,860
and other stuff, yes always.

346
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,110
-Always it was like this or afterwards?

347
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:35,960
-Yes always it was like this but not so sexual desire.

348
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:41,410
-When did you have your fist boyfriend?

349
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:51,370
-The first, if you call it a boyfriend, it could be 11, that's kids.

350
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:59,630
-I don't mean this, I mean when you had complete sex.

351
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:06,870
-The first time I was 14 and I didn't want it.

352
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:10,770
-You didn't like it.

353
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:17,490
-No, I didn't like it, I didn't want it but he was a little bit too strong for me,

354
00:47:17,590 --> 00:47:22,040
he was much older than me and ...

355
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:31,250
-When it was the first time that you enjoyed sex, what age?

356
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:47,250
-27 I think. I really enjoyed it and relaxed in a way.

357
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:06,400
-As a young girl you were interested very much in boys going out or not really?

358
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:15,900
-Yes, I was going out quite much but I had very much to do because my mother was sick

359
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,400
and she died when I was 15.I had to do the house, it was my father and me.

360
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:29,940
I work in the shop, I go to school, so I had not so much time but I was a lot of time out.

361
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:31,290
I like to be out yes.

362
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:50,040
-Did you like to dance?

363
00:48:51,290 --> 00:49:00,690
-I like very much to dance, I love to dance, everything and very much quiet music,

364
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,040
all kind of music.

365
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:16,540
-Do you remember when this leucorrhea stopped, at what age?

366
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:21,990
Did you take some medicine to stop the leucorrhea?

367
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:32,840
-Yes I will tell you because when I was 14 in this first intercourse, he was a sea man.

368
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:45,490
He gave me the gonorrhea, I think after that and I had a bladder infection 5 times after

369
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:53,620
that in very short intervals and I got antibiotics all these times.

370
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:56,340
That was in very short time.

371
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:05,410
-You took antibiotics a lot?
-Penicillin and some antibiotics.

372
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:12,250
I'm allergic to penicillin. I noticed when I was 27.

373
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:54,180
-What about the flatulence from milk, you have said if you drink milk it's much.

374
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:58,750
-Not flatulence, it's bloatedness.

375
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:05,480
-Also from fruit is still there?

376
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:16,980
-Yes because I think it's a cross allergic. I'm with hay fever, allergic to most grass and

377
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:25,080
things, so I can't eat pears, apples, peach.

378
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:31,910
-What it does to you?
-It gives me bloatedness, always bloatedness.

379
00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:36,060
-Without gas?

380
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:48,410
-Very little coming out, it stays there and I can't eat potatoes I have notices, too.

381
00:51:55,160 --> 00:52:20,750
Farinaceous food and potatoes too. I got very thirsty from sweets and very thirsty from alcohol.

382
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:28,930
One glass of wine, I have to have two glasses of water and one little chocolate bite

383
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:32,590
I need a glass or two of water.

384
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:55,400
-The pork you say also it gives you some aggravation?

385
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,900
-Yes some aggravation and fat.

386
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:26,150
-You still like spicy things?

387
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:40,750
-Yes I like spicy, I like very much shrimps with garlic and chili, that's very good.

388
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:52,250
In a way if I'm bloated I feel for something strong, alcohol too, bitter.

389
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:58,580
Because I feel it does something to relax in a way.

390
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:06,980
-The smell of food you like or it gives you some nausea?

391
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:16,590
-No. Smell of pork maybe, I don't like.

392
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:52,240
Because one time when I was 16 I ate so much of this crispy in Christmas evening that

393
00:54:52,340 --> 00:55:02,330
I vomit the whole night and after that I can't stand it and I feel it's swelling fingers.

394
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:06,330
-With pork is this?

395
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:26,570
In the night when you wake up you still feel bloated?

396
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:32,570
-Not in the night but in the morning I'm bloated.

397
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,270
-When you wake up?

398
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:43,820
-Yes, sometimes very little, sometimes a little more and it gets worse and worse during the day,

399
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:48,920
so in the evening it's very much sometimes. It looks like I'm pregnant.

400
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:57,820
-Which is the worse hour about 5-6 o'clock in the afternoon or 8 o'clock or you can not say?

401
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:08,810
-No, it's goes on, I get worse and worse. Most in the evening and if it's very bad I had

402
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:16,010
some nausea too and some heaviness in head, not pain but heaviness that I feel it goes together

403
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:19,070
with the bloated stomach.

404
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:53,810
-Do you still have your menses?

405
00:56:53,910 --> 00:57:04,190
-No, it's one and a half year since the last one. But I have no trouble.

406
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:14,490
It's the same as before, less trouble, not the pre-menstrual.

407
00:57:29,490 --> 00:57:35,220
-When you come here to Alonissos this time do you swim in the sea?

408
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:44,470
-Yes, I love to swim. I swim in Norway 2 weeks ago and it was 8 degrees, so here...

409
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:47,970
-You like swimming and do you feel good?

410
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:56,820
-Very good, I love to be in the sea on a boat. I love to be in the sea from most time.

411
00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:02,770
-Do you like oranges?

412
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:10,140
-I like them but I don't eat them because they are bad for the kidneys.

413
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:13,890
-For the kidneys?
-Yes.

414
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:20,740
-Why?
-They damage them.

415
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:29,640
It's very difficult to clean the orange out of the kidneys, I have learned that.

416
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:30,670
-When?

417
00:58:30,770 --> 00:58:41,230
-I learn reflex therapy under the feet. But I love them, when I was a small kid

418
00:58:41,330 --> 00:58:45,570
if I get one orange I wanted 7-8 more.

419
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:53,470
-You desire.
-Yes, very big desire.

420
00:58:53,570 --> 00:58:57,670
-Yes.

421
00:58:57,770 --> 00:59:00,390
-But now you don't take them at all.

422
00:59:00,490 --> 00:59:02,890
-Yes because I know they are not healthy for me.

423
00:59:02,990 --> 00:59:12,400
They said don't take anything but I can take some lemon sometimes and eat lemon directly.

424
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:16,080
-Eat pure lemon?
-Yes.

425
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:40,820
-In the sea if you are, let us say swimming all day, will you avoid the bloatedness, you

426
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:44,920
don't feel the bloatedness?

427
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:54,230
-I don't know but I think I feel a little better if I'm much in the sea.

428
00:59:54,330 --> 01:00:03,830
I feel it with the whole me, the skin and everything, that is most good.

429
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:09,730
-Have you ever taken Sepia?

430
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:20,730
-Yes, I think a homeopath in Norway gave me one dose but it did not do nothing.

431
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:24,430
-It did not disturb.

432
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:37,430
-No, because I see my journal I go and pick it up from his office to see what he gave me

433
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:44,650
and I saw the Sepia one time, what he wrote, do nothing and then I was on Tuberculinum

434
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:47,250
again I think. It's many years ago.

435
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:50,400
-Medorrhinum you took?

436
01:00:50,500 --> 01:01:04,150
-Yes and maybe it worked for very short time because he changed it and I think it was right

437
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:15,330
but I get some heavy legs from it. If I walk upstairs I feel that my legs of wood.

438
01:01:17,350 --> 01:01:22,840
So I'm not really sure about what happens with this Medorrhinum.

439
01:01:23,330 --> 01:01:30,480
-In general you say you are hot person?
-Yes, in general I'm hot.

440
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:40,350
I can be very sensitive to changes sometimes easily cold but I easily get warm again.

441
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:47,250
-Do you need fresh air all the time?

442
01:01:47,350 --> 01:01:51,580
-Yes always, I told you I bought a car without a roof.

443
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,280
-You also took Pulsatilla before?

444
01:01:53,380 --> 01:01:55,580
-Yes, many times.

445
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,080
-And it did not do anything for you?

446
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:08,750
-I'm not sure, yes the first time it did very much and I think I told you before

447
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:11,380
it was my first remedy.

448
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:22,410
It helped me for one year for the stomach. I was good for one year after this remedy.

449
01:02:22,510 --> 01:02:25,180
I think it was 17,18 years ago.

450
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:55,280
I hate warm room, I need fresh air and in the cars I open windows but I have this strange thing,

451
01:02:55,380 --> 01:03:10,880
if I come in a very, very warm room or warm bath I can have gooseflesh and then it's over again.

452
01:03:12,130 --> 01:03:15,390
It's strange because I don't like this heat.

453
01:03:38,850 --> 01:03:45,850
And I noticed when I have stool very often I have to lean back.

454
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:51,850
-To pass the stool?
-Yes to pass the stool.

455
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:12,840
-You sleep on what position?
-Stomach always.

456
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:50,590
-This last year you have been crying or you didn't cry very much.

457
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:53,420
-Not so much.

458
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:17,900
But I can easily cry in a way. That was better than before. I was crying very easily before

459
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:25,000
but if I argue with somebody, especially boyfriend I can cry, yes.

460
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:45,090
And if somebody goes deep in talking to me about me, I cry.

461
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:53,790
-You like consolation?
-Yes.

462
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:11,570
-You have said that warm covering of head made you worse. It's still there?

463
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:12,330
-Oh yes.

464
01:06:12,430 --> 01:06:15,170
-Very much?
-Yes.

465
01:06:24,430 --> 01:06:29,450
What your computers have made?
-Medorrhinum, Pulsatilla, Sepia.

466
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:19,350
-I see that the class is divided into 3 groups. The one is the Pulsatilla group,

467
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:24,350
the other is the Sepia group and the other is the Medorrhinum group.

468
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:43,340
Some of the questions, as you understood, referred to the underline layer when I hear

469
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:51,930
I had a lot of leucorrhea as a child, immediately brings the mind to the idea of Sepia.

470
01:07:53,430 --> 01:08:06,500
Then Sepia investigation concerning sex and then it came out this experience

471
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:16,260
which was not very good, so either she is Sepia and she can not enjoy until

472
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:18,430
she goes out of Sepia.

473
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:27,000
That's why she stays long time or because of the bad experience itself,

474
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:39,350
it may not been able to enjoy but the infection also complicated matters.

475
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:56,250
So it's not a simple matter of Sepia layer and then the idea of Medorrhinum of course came up

476
01:08:56,350 --> 01:09:07,750
and she confirms, she actually by saying as a child I like very much eating the oranges,

477
01:09:07,850 --> 01:09:19,360
you may most probably think that the layer with which she came, the first layer was Medorrhinum.

478
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:34,100
And then due to antibiotics, penicillin etc. the organism changed and other layers were added.

479
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:47,670
Until we reached the layer of China and China brought about a change of course which

480
01:09:47,770 --> 01:10:02,750
is quite substantial, like the cough, which was the recent problem together

481
01:10:02,850 --> 01:10:12,300
with the correction of the sleeplessness. The sleeplessness was quite strong and went away.

482
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:30,670
It took away some other symptoms as well, as she described, and now the question is

483
01:10:30,770 --> 01:10:40,910
since China has acted quite well and China has this bloatedness very much,

484
01:10:41,010 --> 01:10:46,420
China is one of the most bloated remedies. The most bloated remedies

485
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:52,770
are the first one is Colchicum.

486
01:10:56,770 --> 01:11:08,770
In intensity of bloatedness without being able to bring out this is Colchicum.

487
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:23,420
Then the second one still is not Lycopodium, it is China and the third one

488
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:30,760
is Argentum nitricum and then is Lycopodium and Carbo vegetabilis.

489
01:11:37,510 --> 01:11:45,510
The Colchicum is the highest, very bloated without being able to bring out any gas.

490
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:59,920
Is this case of Colchicum, of China or what is the case and we have to decide whether

491
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:06,850
we shall give China again or we shall give Pulsatilla, Sepia or Medorrhinum or even Lycopodium.

492
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:18,600
-She said already that she repeated China and it didn't work.

493
01:12:19,050 --> 01:12:23,000
The last few months she took Arsenicum and then she took China and it didn't work.

494
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:24,550
-But maybe in a higher potency.

495
01:12:38,430 --> 01:12:45,580
She took Medorrhinum, she took Pulsatilla, she took Sepia, she took the remedies and

496
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:50,680
yet she was in that state in what she found, why? Do you know why?

497
01:12:51,190 --> 01:13:00,580
Because she did not follow the right order of remedies. There was an order of remedies.

498
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:10,340
The uppermost is, let us say, Pulsatilla. The second is Tuberculinum, the third is Lycopodium

499
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:11,960
the fourth is whatever.

500
01:13:12,460 --> 01:13:19,510
If you don't follow in a case the right order, you see this kind of mess.

501
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:27,930
You remember when we saw originally the case it was not clear at all, what was the remedy.

502
01:13:30,180 --> 01:13:35,930
Now it's becoming clear, the remedy is more clear.

503
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:58,510
What is this clear remedy after all this analysis? This is good for examination paper.

504
01:14:01,510 --> 01:14:13,080
You have to put together. First things, first. There is a possibility for Medorrhinum

505
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:16,880
because she says so much she likes the sea.

506
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:26,630
She sleeps on the abdomen, she doesn't orange or you don't know whether she likes

507
01:14:26,730 --> 01:14:31,630
or doesn't like but anyhow there are some arguments and you can say

508
01:14:31,730 --> 01:14:33,730
the possibility of Medorrhinum is there.

509
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:41,640
The question you have to ask is the time of Medorrhinum has arrived?

510
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:49,380
It may arrive but it is now or we have a better choice than Medorrhinum

511
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:51,130
and what is the better choice?

512
01:14:51,230 --> 01:15:01,880
If this is a Sepia choice, a Sepia choice for this moment you have to hear not only

513
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:04,130
I like dancing, this is not enough.

514
01:15:04,230 --> 01:15:14,130
You have to hear that, OK forget the leucorrhea, but at least you have to hear

515
01:15:14,230 --> 01:15:17,980
that you have the libido very much down.

516
01:15:18,730 --> 01:15:29,130
You don't hear that. On the other hand Sepia is a cold remedy.

517
01:15:29,230 --> 01:15:39,980
She is warm, ameliorated in the cold air, she goes and baths at 8 degrees.

518
01:15:44,230 --> 01:15:47,730
I don't know how many they will bath at 8 degrees.

519
01:15:52,230 --> 01:16:05,630
So if your computers have said either first, second, third, fourth... the mind should say

520
01:16:05,730 --> 01:16:13,380
if this person is still aggravated by pork, if the pork aggravates,

521
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:22,130
if aversion to fat is still there after China, if the heat aggravates this person,

522
01:16:22,230 --> 01:16:26,980
if the open air ameliorates, she said it very strongly.

523
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:43,130
You know these remedies and you battle with these remedies like you know they are bloated remedies

524
01:16:43,230 --> 01:16:51,380
and you forget that if you go and see distention in the abdomen, you will have 325 remedies,

525
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:58,890
it's not only these 5, it's another 320 remedies, between them it's also Pulsatilla.

526
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:06,040
Do you like consolation, oh yes you hear how she said consolation.

527
01:17:06,140 --> 01:17:27,230
Oh yes I like consolation. So the case for me and for you also is clear. It's becoming clear.

528
01:17:31,140 --> 01:17:38,390
The idea is as you go along, year after year, you have your patient getting better and better.

529
01:17:39,090 --> 01:17:50,210
The idea is not back, forth, back, forth. So here she has said I was given Pulsatilla

530
01:17:50,310 --> 01:17:56,960
and I was not cured but I believe you have a different idea of what cure is today than

531
01:17:57,060 --> 01:18:00,560
the idea you had when you started this course.

532
01:18:01,310 --> 01:18:06,210
When you started this course you had the idea that somebody takes a remedy and he is cured.

533
01:18:06,310 --> 01:18:16,210
This is not the majority, this is the minority. This is a small minority,

534
01:18:16,310 --> 01:18:26,310
very small minority today I will say, that will just take one remedy and everything will be going.

535
01:18:27,060 --> 01:18:37,460
So in most of the cases today you need to find the "mitos of Ariadne",

536
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:40,390
how it is called from the Minotaur.

537
01:18:42,150 --> 01:18:49,540
-Did I understand right that you said she has constipation which is only ameliorated

538
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:51,230
by leaning backwards?

539
01:18:51,730 --> 01:18:54,880
-Yes, that's another for Medorrhinum.

540
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:58,880
-It's only Medorrhinum and it's very peculiar symptom.

541
01:18:58,980 --> 01:19:08,380
-That is correct, I forgot to mention this. If you look there, she has amelioration in the sea

542
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:14,160
and she has also this leaning back ameliorates.

543
01:19:20,390 --> 01:19:25,960
-I don't quite understand, do you think she changed so much also on mental-emotional level?

544
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:33,640
You think of Pulsatilla because of the food modalities and so on?

545
01:19:39,890 --> 01:19:45,290
Because the sleeplessness went away which I think it's very important symptom.

546
01:19:45,390 --> 01:19:50,540
I thought China has done so good that I would have tried to give it higher first

547
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:52,600
and then to look if it goes to Pulsatilla.

548
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:11,350
-China is a rather cold remedy, that's the first one.

549
01:20:13,110 --> 01:20:20,750
The second is that certain symptoms on which China was prescribed are not there anymore.

550
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:35,340
On the other hand the uppermost symptoms of the present situation, which they come out quite clearly,

551
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:44,580
are Pulsatilla symptoms. And most probably you will see that Pulsatilla will take away

552
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:52,330
quite a lot of this bloatedness, will give more energy, will have more strong

553
01:20:52,430 --> 01:21:00,350
and underneath that most probably your Medorrhinum will be popping up.

554
01:21:01,050 --> 01:21:04,510
In what way we are still to see.

555
01:21:11,190 --> 01:21:22,080
The symptomatology was mixed in the beginning, very mixed from different remedies and

556
01:21:22,180 --> 01:21:28,180
now it's becoming more clear. It's becoming between Pulsatilla and Medorrhinum.

557
01:21:28,690 --> 01:21:37,830
Pulsatilla is more prominent because of the general condition, general symptoms and

558
01:21:40,850 --> 01:21:51,680
also the fact that she says, when I first took it, the bloatedness went away.

559
01:21:53,470 --> 01:22:03,830
So that means in her case the bloatedness is covered by Pulsatilla. It's a Pulsatilla bloatedness

560
01:22:03,930 --> 01:22:10,520
and not a bloatedness of Colchicum, China or Argentum nitricum.

561
01:22:18,010 --> 01:22:19,200
-Which potency?

562
01:22:22,430 --> 01:22:42,580
-Which potency you like to give? Let me see. 30, 200, 1M, 10M, 50M.

563
01:22:44,090 --> 01:22:59,590
-OK give 50M. No, she doesn't need 50M. 1M or 10M is good enough. 10M.

564
01:23:10,580 --> 01:23:23,920
You will eventually get this feeling for the potency, it's not so tangible. It is intangible.

565
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:33,570
It is an intangible in the homeopathic prescribing, we can not put rules,

566
01:23:33,670 --> 01:23:39,420
very concrete rules, we can not.

567
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:53,070
Why I said to the child, Veratrum 50M and we couldn't get it here anywhere

568
01:23:53,170 --> 01:23:57,200
but I needed Veratrum 50M.

569
01:23:58,950 --> 01:24:05,920
It is the experience to see the depth etc.

570
01:24:09,580 --> 01:24:19,090
I think even 1M will be good enough, even 200 will act but maybe we miss time,
