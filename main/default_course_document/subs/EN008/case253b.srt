1
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:39,910
-The proof now of whether we are right or wrong of course will be after we give the

2
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:45,490
remedy, in a few days. We'll see what happens.

3
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:54,890
But what is important for you to understand is, since you came to learn from me

4
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,890
is how am I thinking.

5
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:08,640
There are two ways of taking down a case where you are blank and you start

6
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,700
asking all the questions in the Repertory.

7
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:22,440
2531 questions and carefully you write down all the answers.

8
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:40,390
What I want you to note down is usually when we teach we say, don't guide your questions.

9
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:50,990
Let the patient fill you with information. And then you make a decision.

10
00:01:53,490 --> 00:02:04,250
In practice, if you know enough, is different. Taking the case when you know enough

11
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:12,070
you don't waist your time into searching all kinds of questions under the earth.

12
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,390
If this case was brought to me as a paper case, I would not be able to make

13
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:27,140
head or tails, why? Because of so many questions and so many answers where the

14
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:34,050
essential things would not be there. They would not come out.

15
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:40,910
It is important for you, when you take a case, to have the essential things come out.

16
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:52,410
The real things, mentally- emotionally. Maybe sometimes it's only physical symptoms that

17
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,910
you have. Sometimes you have a combination.

18
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,660
Sometimes you have more mental and less physical.

19
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,500
You are interested in the truth. You don't make up the cases.

20
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:15,220
You saw how I changed my mind? Vacillated, this is not, let me investigate now Lycopodium etc.

21
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:22,120
She gave me symptoms of Lycopodium- Lachesis, Lycopodium- Lachesis constantly.

22
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:35,630
So what is the remedy? You study and in the evening you come and bring me your answer.

23
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,010
And say according to me, this is the remedy.

24
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:47,110
I give the remedy, I will not tell you anything, we'll see after a few days.

25
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:54,690
You just keep back your thoughts. Now here is the courageous one.

26
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,790
Don't give her ever Lycopodium.

27
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:18,190
-I want to give Lycopodium because the sciatica was right sided and lying on the

28
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:27,930
painful side it is getting worse and she said she has a despair recovery and my

29
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:32,680
observation when she came in was that she decided to take a deep breath.

30
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:40,790
So I used that rubric and you said lying on the knee-elbow position makes it better.

31
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:49,180
-Knee-elbow position how did you find that Lycopodium was better in knee-elbow

32
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,530
position? Show me the Repertorisation.

33
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,280
-It's general, lying knee-elbow position ameliorates.

34
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:13,280
-So for Lycopodium there are more symptoms in favor of Lycopodium.

35
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,320
Let's see from the beginning.

36
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:43,770
Sciatica right side, sciatica worse lying on the painful side, sensitive to clothing on the

37
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:52,520
abdomen, back pain lumbar region extending to feet, sacral region extending to feet,

38
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,700
which is combined of course, one symptom.

39
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:44,930
Then ailments from grief, jealousy, only one, thirst for small quantities.

40
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:56,760
Here the main points which are in favor of Lycopodium will be right side sciatica

41
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:07,250
lying on painful side worse plus the drinking of the sips of water and the desire for

42
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,990
sweets that has increased the last few months.

43
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:20,410
This will be in favor of Lycopodium and you can give Lycopodium and you will get good marks.

44
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,410
You pass.

45
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:35,490
One leg hot and the other cold also is in favor of Lycopodium.

46
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,990
Warm ameliorates also is in favor of Lycopodium.

47
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:53,690
You give Lycopodium first and see what happens.

48
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:21,180
-I just thought that Lachesis is not under the rubric sensitive to pain, so Lycopodium is there?

49
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:41,330
-Lachesis suffers more. In the suffering, when you see the suffering of Lachesis

50
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:44,200
suffering is more than Lycopodium.

51
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:54,520
-I would prescribe Lachesis because of a couple of observations.

52
00:08:54,620 --> 00:09:04,520
First it is that she seemed to me highly possessive of situations, of partners, of things

53
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:18,330
like that. Second I acknowledge that she thought she was very nervous, she was

54
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:31,690
suffering a lot, she was walking in one leg and she started to talk and talk and she got calm.

55
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:45,690
So I took the modality of discharges ameliorate. And in my opinion, talking is a discharge.

56
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:55,100
The other thing is that she suffered disappointment, very high emotional disappointment.

57
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,190
I based my information on that.

58
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:10,440
-I have to make an observation concerning your remarks.

59
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:16,860
That she did not talk like Lachesis.

60
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:23,860
When you have a real Lachesis loquacity, she will not stop talking.

61
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:31,010
You just manage to put one question, how are you and the rest is for her.

62
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:37,670
There is no chance for you asking a second question. That is the typical loquacity of

63
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:43,420
Lachesis and when you see it how she jumps from one subject to the other, then she

64
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,920
goes there and then she goes to that and then to the husband and to the father, to the

65
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:54,160
son, then to the mother and then goes back again to previous lives etc.

66
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:03,510
And then you sit back and you say, I don't need anything more, this is Lachesis.

67
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:12,910
But the loquacity is of that order and then you say this is loquacity.

68
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:24,750
Was she loquacious? I will not put her as a symptom, loquacity.

69
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:37,250
Concerning your other remark possessive yes. Strong.

70
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:43,640
-First of all I would like to say the pain, I've seen in her such pain that you don't have to

71
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:49,140
go to the rubrics of very sensitive to pain to either confirm or eliminate it was severe pain.

72
00:11:49,240 --> 00:12:00,390
And second when she was into amateur dramatic on the stage. She was very good at it

73
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:05,240
very natural and she has a passion, she is a passionate person I think.

74
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:12,640
-She is a passionate person. You see why we had a problem?

75
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:18,890
Because she is a passionate person, she says sex I enjoy, I still like this man who was

76
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:26,740
biting me and all that and I did not go with another man.

77
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:41,150
She wants sex, she talks with her friends, she says I miss sex.

78
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:56,560
Yet she will not say, forget it I need some outlet which is in favor of Lachesis and against Lycopodium.

79
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:09,310
Yet the one feet cold and the other hot is in favor of Lycopodium and against Lachesis.

80
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:32,380
She has no disturbance in the stomach abdomen where you expect that it will be the

81
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,970
weak point of Lycopodium.

82
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:43,470
Abdomen full of gas, stomach burping, you don't see this.

83
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:57,970
But is it possible the idea now Lycopodium and later on perhaps Lachesis?

84
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:10,870
We are scientists. We want really to find the exact situation.

85
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:17,880
That is what is important because if we make a mistake, OK you give Lycopodium and

86
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,220
then you give Lachesis, what is there?

87
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:27,980
You can do this also, it's not a big deal. Why should we discuss so much about it?

88
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:35,130
But this is how you are learning. This is what you came here to learn.

89
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:43,870
To learn to differentiate exactly on this problematic situations and how am I thinking

90
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:50,140
and what am I thinking? So you can get the ideas.

91
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:04,540
-I thought that she is Lachesis constitutional person but when you asked her about

92
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:11,460
her jealousy, she remembered when her husband gave a kiss in a bar, years ago.

93
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:17,950
That came up in her head at this moment and you can see a lot of things have changed.

94
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:24,640
She has developed acutely Lycopodium situation where some points are coming but

95
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:30,890
still the bloating is not there. I think eventually it will come too but when you take the

96
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:36,400
Lycopodium acute situation away, I think she needs Lachesis afterwards.

97
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:45,420
-My problem is that the sciatica is more of the Lachesis type.

98
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:58,580
I mean the acute situation as pathology it fits Lachesis and not Lycopodium so much.

99
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:09,840
It fits more to Lachesis the acute situation because Lachesis is characteristic that it is

100
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:15,430
right side and goes right down to the foot.

101
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:29,030
So she mentioned immediately some Lachesis symptoms as far as the acute concern.

102
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:47,790
Is Lachesis left sided? Yes but not in sciatica. Let's clear this.

103
00:16:49,200 --> 00:17:00,350
When we say a remedy is left side or right side, we must be careful not always blindly think this way.

104
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:07,720
Because in sciatica actually Lachesis is a very painful sciatica situation.

105
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:16,350
Kali iodine, Lachesis and Colocynthis are the three remedies which are suffering a lot

106
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:22,850
with sciatica. I don't know why but the pain is really tremendous and when you see

107
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:40,200
you think this is Kali iodine or this is Colocynthis or is Lachesis. They suffer.

108
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:49,580
What was interesting in this case is the moment when, do you remember when she

109
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:54,430
calmed down? Who can tell me?

110
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:05,060
The pain calmed down when she spoke about a specific thing that came out.

111
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,050
-Her relationship with her husband?

112
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:28,740
-No. The relationship with her sister. She spoke about this relationship and after coming

113
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:37,500
out all that I noticed that she was not so much in pain anymore.

114
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:51,260
Therefore I suspected that this is again a jealousy situation between herself and her sister.

115
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:57,400
Now her father came later on and he said, that is true. I don't remember if you said it

116
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,510
to the class? Yes you said it to the class.

117
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:14,570
-I would like to hear your comment on another suggestion.

118
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:21,070
Yesterday Ernest asked to check her case acute, if we could something quickly.

119
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:29,820
We had no books, no computer but we got some other information than you got.

120
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:43,570
We asked about what happened before the sciatica and what her opinion was of what

121
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:49,060
should have caused it. Of course she mentioned the bad relationship and the fighting and

122
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:58,970
all that but also she mentioned she had a fall on her coccyx and she also felt that it might

123
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:11,430
have started there. That with all the modalities of the sciatica which was resembling

124
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:19,930
Rhus-tox but it was right sided and she also expressed a lot of guilt about how she raised

125
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:31,950
her child and a definite feeling of she had done wrong.

126
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:42,210
Taking that into consideration we thought about Ruta which she just got this morning in a 30.

127
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:51,430
My way of thinking is first she got an aggravation and then perhaps later on during

128
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:56,030
your interview an amelioration.

129
00:20:56,770 --> 00:21:07,180
Also during the aggravation the pain killers which she used help her, didn't work.

130
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,120
What do you think about Ruta as acute?

131
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,580
-Ruta has been given.

132
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:20,180
-Only this morning, not before.

133
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:34,790
-Well I will tell you. When she felt the amelioration, she felt it while sitting, with no move.

134
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,720
So Rhus Tox is out.

135
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:52,960
In order to have an effect from Ruta, I did not see how this case could fit to Ruta.

136
00:21:54,210 --> 00:22:09,350
I do not see it at all but as aggravation I don't see it either because she was constantly

137
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:16,350
in that situation. She said I'm in that situation for the last two months.

138
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:28,330
It's not a matter of today she was aggravated. It is for the last two months. I don't see it at all.

139
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,740
-What happened after Ruta? She said she had a terrible aggravation after Ruta.

140
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,000
So she tried to take pain killers and they didn't work as they used to.

141
00:22:48,250 --> 00:23:01,150
-The pain killers she said, she had to wait for 6 hours. I mean she can not take a

142
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:09,390
pain killer after 3 hours again and this is what she knows she could not do.

143
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:17,790
This is the usual situation where the pain killer can make her rest for a while and then

144
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:25,230
the pain comes. So this is the usual situation. It's not different today than the other

145
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:27,300
days, as I understand.

146
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:35,970
If I don't have enough symptoms for one remedy or another remedy...

147
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:39,820
Here we have more than enough symptoms for both remedies.

148
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:46,820
In your question you say, if you don't have enough symptoms, yes I will look for a small remedy.

149
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:56,810
Here we have strong symptoms for Lachesis and quite strong symptoms for Lycopodium as well.

150
00:23:56,910 --> 00:24:04,570
What is interesting is she says, the last few months I have developed a desire

151
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:09,660
for sweets which is very strong Lycopodium symptom.

152
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:18,070
Can you ignore it? This is the question and on what strength you may ignore it

153
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:20,350
because you may have to ignore it one or the other.

154
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:27,620
The remedy which is going to act is one or the other. It's not both at the same time.

155
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:33,870
You have to decide this is the remedy which is going to act.

156
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:47,910
-What about the clothing around the waist? Lycopodium is there as a capital.

157
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:51,760
I can't see why we can't give Lycopodium.

158
00:24:53,750 --> 00:25:02,410
-I will tell you what is the problem. As a constitution this girl is Lycopodium?

159
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:08,410
You ask yourself and then you ask as an acute is Lycopodium?

160
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,410
So there are two different questions.

161
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:15,910
First answer the question, is this a constitutional Lycopodium case?

162
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,660
-No.

163
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:26,660
-The answer is no. You go now to the acute. As an acute it can be Lycopodium?

164
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,760
-Of course.

165
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:33,480
-And you say yes. You go to Lachesis now and you ask the question again.

166
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:38,910
As a constitution this can be Lachesis?
-Yes.

167
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:46,010
-And as an acute it can be Lachesis?
-Yes.

168
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:54,850
-So what prevents you from giving Lachesis is desire for sweets.

169
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:12,050
-And the coldness, heat ameliorates.
-Try to find worse cold.

170
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:22,760
What is impressive in this case is a point which you have not take it inside.

171
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:38,660
It is when she says all these things, all this came out, the father said for the first time

172
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,930
I heard all this, I did not know anything.

173
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:57,240
When it came out, then there is a relief of the pain, this is very important because the

174
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:10,090
aggression kept inside, I hate him. You didn't register, she said, I hate him.

175
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:15,230
I had a passionate relationship with him but he let me down, he bit me.

176
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:33,090
Still I like him. And then I can not touch here, don't touch me here, I can not  put anything here.

177
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:44,740
This is exactly what I said when I was taking the case. These are complementary.

178
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,320
This is what I'm thinking, first Lycopodium and then Lachesis.

179
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:54,160
What did I do? This, what you decide to do, is finally very important.

180
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,200
You balance the things.

181
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:04,660
A very strong sensitivity in the throat.

182
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,450
-So you give Lachesis.

183
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:25,480
-She has no fear of being alone. When she is in pain, she needs somebody of

184
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:29,730
being around, it's not a fear of being alone.

185
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:34,570
She said, when I feel well I don't need anybody. This is not fear of being alone.

186
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:41,980
-But she said she has fear of being alone now that she didn't have her husband and

187
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,870
she was alone with the child.

188
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,340
-It's because of the responsibility.

189
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:54,740
-She meant something else. Fear of being alone in life. This is different.

190
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,420
Lycopodium is different, it's pathology. What she says, it's a natural thing.

191
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:09,150
Now I don't have a husband, I have to work and I have a fear of what am I going

192
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,990
to do in life, who is going to support me?

193
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,250
-But he didn't support her.

194
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:24,960
-Let me explain to you. The pathology in Lycopodium is when without any reason

195
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:33,070
you feel of being alone. When I'm alone here suddenly .... in the room alone.

196
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:43,070
In the house alone. But if I have even a child it's OK, it's a comfort.

197
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:52,900
The other what she said, I have a fear of being alone in life, not in a room or in the house.

198
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,910
Because she stays alone now in the house.

199
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:06,150
So shall I tell you what I gave?

200
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:10,900
Lachesis.

201
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:27,060
I gave Lachesis high potency 10M because I felt from the story that she is telling

202
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:38,900
me that the emotions that she had once she expressed them, she was relieved.

203
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:51,650
Expressing, the observation that somebody did, with discharges Lachesis feel better.

204
00:30:53,400 --> 00:31:01,060
She has to discharge, she has to bring out the turmoil which is inside and that turmoil

205
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:07,050
with Lachesis is really aggressive. It's like, as I said, Colocynthis, Kali iodinum

206
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:13,150
Nux vomica has that kind of state, which I perceived in her.

207
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:29,740
Aggressiveness, the feelings that they were inside were pushing this sciatica making that terrific pain.

208
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:35,570
The moment she started talking and discharging this because she was alive in the

209
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:41,840
interview. She was much more alive than the other one.

210
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:51,240
Do you all agree? That means she was bringing out real emotions.

211
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:59,090
When she spoke, she spoke really on her emotions. This is very important.

212
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:05,000
Lachesis can not hold back, they have strong emotions and bring it out.

213
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,250
And then there is a relief.

214
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:25,840
But most probably when she goes home and this relief will be temporary, it's not cured.

215
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:36,980
That is why many times they say to us, you take a nice case and you have a placebo

216
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:43,680
effect because you are so nice with the patient etc.

217
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:50,530
But I have never seen a cure like this, being nice with the person.

218
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:57,350
How they have found out? If they do an experiment of course some people will say

219
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:03,360
I feel better because I talk. Of course, they feel better but not cured.

220
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:15,640
It's a different thing to see that this girl is really coming back as a balanced person.

221
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:22,470
Not only the sciatica is better but as a whole person is better.

222
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:36,370
-I'd like to remind you what you said in the beginning today about Calc. carbonica.

223
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:43,180
Because when you saw her, her physical expression is very much a Calc. carbonica.

224
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:49,190
-Correct. We started thinking this most probably is a Calc. carbonica. Continue.

225
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:56,680
-In the continuance and follow up maybe the Calc. carbonica will appear sooner or later.

226
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:59,670
-Yes, there is a possibility.

227
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:21,270
Here looking at her you get the idea of Calc. carbonica, as I said in the beginning.

228
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:35,120
Flabbiness, white and a little bit plump, better heat, desire sweets, so the idea can be.

229
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:38,610
Why we do not go to Calc. carbonica?

230
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,460
-Because of the sciatica?

231
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:55,030
-No, the sciatica won't bother because Calc. carbonica has all kinds of sciatica.

232
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:03,450
It can have lumbagos and sciaticas of different types.

233
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:15,100
But Calc. carbonica will not load herself with this kind of emotional loading.

234
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:30,800
The whole thing in her started with the husband relationship, the conflict and keeping

235
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:36,240
a lot of anger and hatred and resentment.

236
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:41,300
So we have to go to remedies which can do that.

237
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:50,960
If she was coming back and say, well after this impact my digestive system is

238
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:58,440
unbalananced. My liver is affected, my stomach is affected, my abdomen is affected

239
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:08,790
then in spite of the fact that we will have this kind of sensitivity, will say more Lycopodium.

240
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:19,040
Here it's a tricky situation because usually Lachesis is worse warm.

241
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:24,620
What about worse cold?

242
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:38,040
That means in some cases you may get the worse cold in Lachesis as well.

243
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:54,450
She is better by warm, worse by cold but sciatica better warm. Wait you will see now.

244
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:59,290
Lycopodium, Magnesia phosphorica.

245
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:09,540
If we take this symptom and we take it as a primary symptom, is this a primary symptom?

246
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,640
-No.

247
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:16,540
-Did you get the idea that putting warm it just takes the pain away?

248
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,090
-No.

249
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:25,740
-In Magnesia phosphorica, in Arsenicum and Lycopodium putting warmth is like a big

250
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,250
relief; that is what it says in the Repertory.

251
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:33,930
In the Repertory it is this.

252
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:40,830
What she said was it this type of amelioration from warmth?

253
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:42,170
-No.

254
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:11,220
-Warmth of bed ameliorates, go a bit further, you can see it. Arsenicum, Causticum,

255
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:17,370
Kali bichromicum, Lycopodium. You see how strong is Lycopodium?

256
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:26,170
Did she say that in bed she is better? No, on the contrary.

257
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:34,070
Where is now this symptom? If you can not discriminate between these things, you have

258
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:40,320
to be very careful. What she says is very important. How she says it's very important.

259
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,120
Otherwise you go wrong.

260
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:53,080
She says, well I put some warm, she suffers in bed every night.

261
00:38:55,620 --> 00:39:02,000
She says I have to wake up and have to suffer because she takes a pain killer and

262
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:06,090
during the sleep the pain comes.

263
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:12,230
If this is Lycopodium wouldn't have been better if you take that symptom.

264
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:16,720
If you take that symptom, forget it, you are not a homeopath.

265
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:28,240
You are a digitalizing person. This the computer can do it, not you.

266
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:35,400
You are here, you see, you understand what is written here and then you don't go to

267
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,820
make that mistake.

268
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:49,330
-It is best that generals, pain, night, in sleep aggravation if Lycopodium?

269
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:05,830
-In the generalities?

270
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:37,290
What has to do with the case? This is generality, this is talking about pain sleep.

271
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:48,040
What has this symptom to do with warmth ameliorates?

272
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:55,690
What has to do with sciatica? You can go and find and symptom to justify some idea.

273
00:40:55,790 --> 00:41:04,460
This is not correct. You have to be very careful in what you are doing. I'm sorry, not you.

274
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:35,190
This is general, night, in sleep, aggravates. Mercury, Nit. acid. These are the syphilitic

275
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:43,040
pains which are aggravated and Lycopodium has a place there, somewhere.

276
00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:06,530
It is a fact that in this case it is a very difficult decision between Lycopodium and Lachesis.

277
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:16,370
So we say Lachesis, I give you my reasons for that but we may have to go back to

278
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:20,190
Lycopodium or we may have to go back to Calc. carbonica.

279
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:26,590
It doesn't mean anything. The facts are facts.

280
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:32,070
And the fact is that before we see the effect, we can not be sure.

281
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:51,720
Especially in this case. We have to see whether she may have an aggravation before... We'll see.

282
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:08,050
-Just after the interview she had a menstrual flow started and it's about a week early and

283
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:15,310
she was frightened to go to sleep because she usually has an aggravation after sleep

284
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:16,590
and during sleep.

285
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:22,220
But she woke up with (?) and she was fine, the pain was a lot less, she was reading

286
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,830
and she was comfortable.

287
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:34,830
-You don't know actually now how she is?

288
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:45,450
-This is during the break, before I came in, she felt a lot better. She was a lot better.

289
00:43:54,050 --> 00:44:01,310
And she took the remedy about 1 o'clock.

290
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:18,560
-The critical point will be tonight where we will see whether the pain really is...

291
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:28,700
There is a possibility that she maybe aggravates still tonight and by tomorrow evening

292
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:35,060
she will start feeling better, we will see. I'll see you tomorrow.
