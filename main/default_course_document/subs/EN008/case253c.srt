1
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:16,230
-Tell me how are you at this moment where it is more than 24 hours. You took the

2
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:29,030
remedy yesterday at 1 o'clock, now 28 hours later. Give me first how you are at this

3
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,620
moment and then you tell me what actually happened.

4
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:42,370
-This moment I have a bit of pain which is bearable pain in here.

5
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,620
-It doesn't extend down?
-No.

6
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:53,120
-It stayed on the original part where it is originated. You still have some pain there.

7
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,470
-Like a tight.

8
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:03,900
-How much you would say you are better in percentage?

9
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:23,980
-60-70%, 50-60%. I'm just scared that it's gonna come back again.

10
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,130
-How did you sleep?

11
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:49,130
-Good. 8 hours. 5 hours and then I woke up and then I had a little pain and then I slept

12
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,630
again for 3 hours.

13
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,970
-So you made up from the sleep you have lost.
-Yes.

14
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,820
-Since you took the remedy you did not take more pain killers? -No.

15
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:20,050
-When did you feel that the pain has left from the extension? In the night in bed was

16
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,350
still there, the extension?

17
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:32,040
-Yes and this morning like a knife going down.
-When it has left the extension?

18
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:56,960
-About 1 o'clock. 1 o'clock I had a big explosion of pain, agony like yesterday.

19
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,040
-For how long?
-For an hour.

20
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:08,050
-And then the pain started going down substantially?

21
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:23,160
-Yes. And no pain at all afterwards. Just a feeling but no pain.

22
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,400
-And then what happened?

23
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:40,210
-Then about 4 o'clock it started to come back a little, here.

24
00:04:48,960 --> 00:05:04,120
-Can you tell me if you felt any other change?
-A lot. I just feel really good, very good.

25
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:14,470
When yesterday afternoon fell asleep and in 5 minutes my whole body jerked awake

26
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:21,470
like a big spasm, my whole body just woke me up, so I did go back to sleep.

27
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:28,320
I stayed awake till late evening. It was as if it was saying, don't sleep.

28
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,120
-When did you fall asleep?

29
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:42,320
-11.30 and I had feelings about the relationship and sadness.

30
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,380
-You rethought about the whole issue.

31
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:54,540
-I was trying to remember what you asked me, like when was the first time that I wanted

32
00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:03,120
to leave and I remember a few different incidents that made me feel really sad, cried.

33
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,360
-You cried?
-Yes.

34
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,510
-Quite a lot?

35
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:23,780
-Not excessively but it was a deep cry. But this afternoon when I had this explosion

36
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:30,020
I got really angry and I just decided I was gonna fight it and it wasn't gonna beat me

37
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:40,470
and I just briefed into the pain. I'm going to beat this.

38
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,100
-Or to bit the whole situation?

39
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:50,840
-Everything. I'm not going to be weak again and I'm going to be strong.

40
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:59,690
Nothing ever again. So I feel very different. I feel as if I understand myself better.

41
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:25,140
-OK Sara maybe you will give us some more feedback before the course and then

42
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,990
I will tell you how to continue. Thank you.
-Thank you.

43
00:07:52,740 --> 00:08:03,890
-This is Sara again. Tell me your experience. Did you have another dose?

44
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:13,640
-No because I felt like it was changing and last night I had a sort of aggravation of the

45
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:23,640
sciatic nerve, not like the other pain I was getting. It was very short and intense.

46
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:30,360
It was like a spasm here but the sciatic nerve went right up my leg and my foot.

47
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:38,050
It's never done that before. It always went over my foot. And it finished.

48
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:44,720
-How long it lasted?
-3 minutes, very quick.

49
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,990
-It was like an explosion?

50
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:52,980
-Yes and then my foot and my leg were burning hot after that.

51
00:08:53,080 --> 00:09:00,580
-For how long?
-An hour and I was very hot as well.

52
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:09,330
-Like if you had a flash.
-But my foot was like on fire.

53
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:22,980
-After that there was a release of the pain?
-Yes after that I fell asleep, I was released.

54
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,660
-What was the time that this happened?
-11.30 last night.

55
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:37,250
-So it was the beginning. You went to bed let's say 10.30 and this happened in the

56
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:42,400
beginning of your sleep and then you slept?
-Yes I slept.

57
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,410
-Right through?
-No.

58
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,900
- You woke up?
-Yes.

59
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
-What time?

60
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,240
-I think about 3 o'clock in the morning. I had about 3 hours sleep.

61
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,270
-How was the pain by that time?

62
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:10,760
-It was OK. I have a lot of activity in my leg, like tinkling and sometimes a little pain

63
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:20,810
on my ankle and more tinkling, it seems like my leg is changing all the time.

64
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:25,810
-So there is activity going on?
-Yes, so I didn't take the other dose.

65
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,760
-In general how would you say you are?

66
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:40,220
-In general much, much better. I took the remedy on Monday. On Tuesday I had two

67
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:50,720
aggravations in the middle of the day of the muscle and it was very emotional and intense;

68
00:10:50,820 --> 00:11:00,500
I was moaning and crying and shouting. I felt as if everything was coming out

69
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:06,750
and then I had this other aggravation last night which felt different.

70
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:16,850
-Which was local actually this time, it was really the nerve reaction as it wanted to go back to place.

71
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,090
-Yes that's right and today I didn't have an aggravation in the middle of the day.

72
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,590
-Today you did not have.

73
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:34,580
-No, I've been stable and just I did have a local pain here and as I said a lot of activity in my leg.

74
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,800
-How much you put the improvement?

75
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:48,810
-80% at least. I feel like it was, when I first received treatment, 2-3 months ago.

76
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,410
This is what I had.

77
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:56,640
-That's how it started.
-I feel very stiff.

78
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:06,640
-Still? It's not totally loose sure. But this I believe, the way you are saying that you are

79
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:17,390
improving, I believe that within 10 days about you will be totally free. I thought maybe the

80
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:24,640
improvement was not so much and I thought maybe you need another.

81
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:32,480
Don't' take dose because then it's dangerous because you gave the impression that it

82
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:42,470
was stuck, it was stalemate  and then I said OK it it's a stalemate that means...

83
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:47,230
though I gave you a remedy which I know it is well potentized.

84
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:57,200
It was from Siffra 10M, so I say very strange maybe she needs another remedy.

85
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:01,950
-I think I was frightened that I was a little bit stuck myself.

86
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,290
-You were afraid because of the experience.

87
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:12,090
-Yes afraid of pain but today I feel much happier that it goes backwards.

88
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:24,640
I remember lots of things about me.
-Like jealousy.

89
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:28,490
-Now you remember!

90
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:39,140
-Yes! And going back to my teenager, when I was a teenager with friends and I feel

91
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:45,640
like I have pushed down my sexual energy and not I felt that it was wrong and I was

92
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:54,990
scared of it. I feel like I'm going to change a lot and be much more natural.

93
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:05,770
-Also can you tell me if you remember when you suppressed your jealousy, was any

94
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:11,690
moment that you remember you decide that feeling is no good?

95
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:25,840
-I can't remember when I suppressed it, I just remember being very devastated by

96
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:36,400
friends when I was a teenager. I have to think more.

97
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:45,250
-How do you evaluate your relationship with your husband?

98
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:59,530
-I just think that I was a fool for being so ...
-Vulnerable.

99
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:07,770
-Yes and I look back and I think, thank god I left. I feel that the intensity of this acute

100
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:15,110
situation is how much I suffered and how much I pushed it down over 2 years, perhaps

101
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:23,710
maybe 3 years, since my daughter was born and so I understand why it happens.

102
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,070
I am very glad that all this has happened.

103
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:39,280
-If in 10 days it's not completed gone, you give me a call and I will tell you but I

104
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:44,030
believe that you will be totally different from now on.

105
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,520
-Me too.

106
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:54,780
-To handle better situations.
-OK thank you.

107
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:18,220
-Now I saw you for the first time 2 years ago and you were in great pain by that time.

108
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:25,620
Eventually according to the follow ups that you wrote me also, you were doing quite

109
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:33,470
well and you got remarried with another man.

110
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,620
The last report I had from you was that you were quite happy and quite satisfied with

111
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:53,100
your life. How is the situation here now? What can you say now?

112
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:04,850
-Everything you say is still true. I'm very different person and I feel much stronger.

113
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:18,760
I'm very happy and my leg, my sciatica never bothers me. I changed in many ways.

114
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:28,160
-Is some acute symptoms that bother you at the moment?

115
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:38,410
-Not so much acute but the right nostril it blocked, it discharges sometimes especially

116
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:44,260
after another Lachesis but very slowly and so I have catarrh.

117
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:51,140
-This catarrh came after a cold and stayed after?

118
00:17:54,910 --> 00:18:04,410
-Yes. I can't remember the exact situation but yes, it's just catarrh that never left.

119
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:10,810
-Do you have anything else? Your menses, period are normal?

120
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:23,410
-My periods are lovely. They are really good. Sometimes I have gastric wind a bloating.

121
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,410
-Your sleep is good?
-Yes.

122
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,360
-Appetite good?

123
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:40,940
-Yes appetite has changed. I took a Pulsatilla after Lachesis and my appetite changed

124
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,370
my desires changed.

125
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,290
-Do you have special desire now?

126
00:18:51,790 --> 00:19:11,190
-I still love humus and black pepper, I love strong tastes but the way that it changed

127
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:18,440
is that I prefer fruits now and not so much the heavy foods that I was eating before.

128
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:28,440
I don't like milk anymore. I gave up milk and now if I drink any milk it sits in my stomach.

129
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,740
It's horrible. So I don't like milk and I gave up tea.

130
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:43,440
-It is an aversion to tea or you just don't desire it anymore?

131
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:50,620
-Yes I drink herbal.

132
00:19:55,870 --> 00:20:04,940
-So there is some catarrh from the nose which is bothering you and some gas in the stomach;

133
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:10,190
this gas is more in the morning, in the afternoon, in the evening?

134
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:18,120
-It's after eating and more in the afternoon and the evening.

135
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:27,740
-What about sweets?
-Yes I like sweets.

136
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,430
-Do you take cheese?

137
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:39,280
-Not as much as I used to. Cheese is not the same.

138
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,120
-You sleep in a particular position?

139
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:52,860
-Always in one side right and left but usually start on the right.

140
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:12,010
-Do you have tiredness in the morning when you wake up?

141
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:22,540
-Yes in the morning it takes me an hour to feel good, I like to be slow in the morning take my time.

142
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:37,630
-Do you take salads? All kinds of salads?
-Yes.

143
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:44,810
-What about raw onions?
-I don't like raw.

144
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:48,920
-You don't like or they sit heavy in your stomach?

145
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:56,420
-No, they don't aggravate me but I don't like raw, it's too strong.

146
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:01,170
-But you said you like strong tastes and pepper but not onions.

147
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,780
-Not onions.

148
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:12,520
-How is your temperature with the weather? You have become more cold, more hot?

149
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:15,620
-More hot. I'm very warm.

150
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:21,010
-Your feet are warm?
-Yes.

151
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,770
-Do you stick them out of covers?

152
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:30,030
-Yes sometimes. I like to sleep with the covers half and change in the night.

153
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,530
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

154
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:04,690
-I like to know what is your criteria for a good solid symptom.

155
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,640
-Very simple question and very simple answer.

156
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:19,250
When the person tells you I have a pain in the right side of the right colic flexure

157
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:25,500
that is a solid symptom. When he says my feet are burning, it's a solid symptom.

158
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:33,500
When he says, I'm very tired, it's a solid symptom. When he says, I'm this or I'm that

159
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:42,600
and the you don't make it out of your mind, you don't project it.

160
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:53,130
She says I have a pain in the right colic flexure and you make a projection.

161
00:23:53,230 --> 00:24:06,460
You say, she has most probably a fear of dogs or a delusion that a dog may bite her

162
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:13,810
on the right side of her abdomen and therefore I take delusion that the dog is barking.

163
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:27,290
That is stupid, that is not a solid symptom. It is only the projection of your mind and if you do that,

164
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:32,140
 you go wrong most of the time. The delusion.

165
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:43,420
I have a delusion that he can not raise the left arm and he has a delusion that he can

166
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:51,750
not raise his arm because his nephew is too heavy and does not want to carry him

167
00:24:51,850 --> 00:25:01,420
in his lap. If you do like this, then you don't have a solid symptom and your prescription

168
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,020
will be entirely out.

169
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:23,750
-One small remark. In the Repertory there is an addition for Silica in italics, desires fat.

170
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:26,190
I don't want to say whose addition it is.

171
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:38,340
-It's my addition. A lot of these additions are not mine but they have put my name into that,

172
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,160
which we are correcting all that.

173
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:48,560
A lot of additions which they bear my name are not really correct.

174
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:53,560
There is some additions on Scorpio. I have added symptoms of Scorpio?

175
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:59,060
I said where the hell did I add symptoms of Scorpio? I don't even know the remedy.

176
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:05,810
I never prescribed it; now there are some additions in the Repertory bearing my name.

177
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:13,930
What people try to do is just send information to confuse the issue and the information

178
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:19,790
that has gone in the Repertories is a confused information, I believe on purpose.

179
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:27,430
Because I speak very badly about certain things which are happening in Homeopathy

180
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:31,680
so they thought, let's have George be involved also.

181
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:38,100
George gave symptoms of this and of that and so there is a total confusion, nobody can

182
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:43,400
clear up the matter except from me, because I know.

183
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:51,040
-The serious question is whether the prescription for the acute situation, let's say if a

184
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:56,490
pneumonia really comes back, will it have a direct relation to the remedies that are

185
00:26:56,590 --> 00:27:00,990
prescribed now? Will be a follow, a complementary?

186
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:03,880
-It might have, it might not.

187
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:18,830
-Can I ask a couple of questions about the model, the groups?

188
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:21,260
Can I read them?

189
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:39,120
You spoke of the significance of the time in which acutes appeared in each group.

190
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:44,590
Can you do the same thing for the initial aggravation, the primary aggravation when you

191
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:45,690
give a prescription?

192
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:52,440
-There are two different things that we are talking about. One is the initial aggravation.

193
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:55,440
This is a totally different subject.

194
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:09,270
Here we are talking about treating acute conditions during chronic treatment

195
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:20,280
First of all what it means to have an acute and secondly whether you should treat or not.

196
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:27,150
Thirdly whether this acute you should expect to be a mild or a severe acute.

197
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:32,080
Knowing all these things, you need to know the model.

198
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:39,220
Concerning the initial aggravation is another subject altogether.

199
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:43,970
We can not be talking everything, in a seminar, like that.

200
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:49,630
-Can I put another question. On page 2.2.7 of your "Science [of Homeopathy]",

201
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:55,660
it says a truly curative response will be preceded by some degree of aggravation of symptoms.

202
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,560
Is this modified according to all groups?

203
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:14,660
-Absolutely. This is modified through experience which I have written there in 1976.

204
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:24,830
The book which I wrote has been written in 1976 and published in 1978 for the first time.

205
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:34,010
Since that time, 20 years later, there is a lot more of experience and observations.

206
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:44,990
This model comes the last 5-7 years where I really had to classify.

207
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:55,330
When I wrote the "new model for health and disease", I wrote it in 1985.

208
00:29:55,430 --> 00:30:02,770
In 1985 I started understand these things, that's why I wrote a new model for health

209
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:05,120
and disease. Do you know this book?

210
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:16,860
In this model I have inserted in a code form, the ideas. These ideas I'm talking about now

211
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,960
more in detail. And what I talk here is not all the details.

212
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:33,960
In the normal school, I talk very much in details about this model.

213
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:55,060
For instance Ortega from Mexico, he is a very good homeopath, when I was saying that

214
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:04,550
there is definitely aggravation of symptoms, he was saying in 1976, I have never seen

215
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:06,850
an aggravation of symptoms.

216
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:17,340
Actually a journalist went and met him in Mexico, took an interview from him and asked

217
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,840
him specifically this question which was published in the

218
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,190
American Journal of Homeopathy.

219
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:31,590
Ortega said, I've never seen an aggravation after the homeopathic remedy, which was

220
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:40,590
amazing for me. How can he say that? Either he has never seen a real cure or he has

221
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:47,440
seen most probably cases on the uppermost or the lowest group.

222
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:59,630
When I wrote this, I was writing main things, still not going into details.

223
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:05,520
Here I'm going 10 times more into details than what is written in the "science".

224
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,900
People read the "Science" and think that's all. No, that's not all.

225
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:15,300
That' s why I made the School in order to give all the teaching.

226
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:20,650
And the teaching is much more than what I give you now.

227
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:30,050
In these last cases also we say there is no aggravation, there is immediate

228
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:38,810
amelioration but that also is stated in the "Science" already by saying that, in incurable

229
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:43,650
cases you may see an immediate amelioration.

230
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:58,060
I stated there as well but I have not yet completed my understanding of Homeopathy during that time.

231
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:10,980
This was also Volume Nr 1. I was supposed to be writing Volume Nr 2 on the "Science"

232
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:16,730
because you will see it says Volume Nr 1 but I never wrote Volume Nr 2.

233
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:26,490
This is the Volume Nr 2, a lot of more information, more details which clarify a lot of

234
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,250
issues that we have in Homeopathy.

235
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:37,760
-Will you let us know how (?) given us in the chart.

236
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:41,550
-I put the miasms yesterday. First one miasm, then two miasm, then three miasm.

237
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:58,350
It goes like this 1 miasm, 2,3,4,7,8 miasms. It's just an idea, as it goes down.

238
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:01,950
-Where is the syphilitic miasm?

239
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:17,850
-Here the 1 miasm can be syphilis, here syphilis. Syphilis can be anywhere in these

240
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:22,950
levels. The only thing is that syphilis here is not complicated with other miasms.

241
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:31,480
It's only syphilis. Here, it's complicated syphilis with psora and with cancer.

242
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:42,980
Here is more complicated, tuberculous miasm, sycotic miasm, cortisone miasm

243
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:46,420
antibiotic miasm and it goes like this.

244
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:57,420
As the case gets more and more complicated, you have to separate more and more miasms.

245
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:07,500
In the previous case that we spoke, we said maybe she needs Radium bromatum to

246
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:16,740
counteract the radiotherapy. Radiotherapy can have created a miasm actually.

247
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:21,640
In which case we come back, we see no effect from Sulphur, no effect from

248
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:27,490
Cal. carbonica, then we may go back and give Radium bromatum.

249
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:43,180
-Is it possible to give say 30 at the time and just after the treatment as an immediate

250
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,490
reaction to deal with it as an acute? Sometimes that can be quite effective.

251
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:56,490
-Yes you can but always I feel the best way is to sit down and take the case and see

252
00:35:56,590 --> 00:36:01,670
whether you can make a logical prescription for the case.

253
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:15,660
Also it's very interesting that the cases from the School, where I treat the cases, that

254
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:24,360
means they come twice a year, they try not to take any other medicine, they wait until I see them.

255
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:30,210
They are doing all of them, very well.

256
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:34,460
And they are complicated cases, difficult cases.

257
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:42,130
Why they are doing all of them well, because nobody else interferes with another remedy.

258
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:51,630
Then you can see really what I say doing well is not the person saying, I'm well.

259
00:36:52,630 --> 00:37:01,940
This is not good enough to say, I'm feeling better, no. It may feel better and may do

260
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:12,710
really well or he says, I feel better and not doing well. You have to realize these issues.

261
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:16,110
Otherwise the person stays on the same level.

262
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:22,110
Unless this person comes to the level where she gets again the pneumonia

263
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:26,460
you have not cured, in spite of the fact she may say, I feel better.

264
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:32,540
She may say, I feel better with 20 remedies. Give whatever you like, she may feel better.

265
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:38,630
Actually with any remedy you can try because the remedies have some effect.

266
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:43,980
Better, better, better but she stays on the same level. The cancer is there.

267
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:56,220
She is going to develop the evolution of cancer unless you are able to bring back the

268
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,570
acne and the pneumonias.

269
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:24,360
Then nobody can say to us, you are placebo effect. I say yes we have placebo effect

270
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:32,310
like everybody else but we have rules and if these rules are not followed, we do not claim

271
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:33,650
that this a cure.

272
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:40,820
We claim this is a cure when these rules are followed and we can prove to you by

273
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,120
showing the cases.

274
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,620
You have the shouter?

275
00:38:55,340 --> 00:39:01,490
-Talking about miasms, Hahnemann describes 3 and some people describe more

276
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:08,490
like tuberculosis and cancerinism and so on but wouldn't you believe that all the

277
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:16,530
miasms AIDS and whatever could join the 3 of Hahnemann, being part of 1 of the 3?

278
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:33,510
-No. The tuberculosis is a specific miasm which is treated by Tuberculinum and then

279
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:39,620
it goes away, the tubercular miasm goes away, not the syphilis.

280
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:43,370
You give Tuberculinum and you treat the syphilitic miasm, no.

281
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:49,520
You treat the tuberculus miasm through Bacillinum or Tuberculinum or the other

282
00:39:49,620 --> 00:40:00,020
remedies or Stannum and then may come the Mercury state where you suspect

283
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:07,040
that most probably this person has a second miasm which is syphilis.

284
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:13,290
Then it comes the sycotic miasm. And then you treat.

285
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:23,460
But I don't accept miasmatic prescriptions.

286
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:35,130
You can not know from the beginning, before you analyze a case that this is sycotic miasm.

287
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:44,200
In order to be sycotic miasm uppermost, you have to have Medorrhinum or Thuja

288
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:54,450
and then you say yes, the uppermost miasm in this case is sycotic or you analyze the case,

289
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:55,800
you see Cancerinum.

290
00:40:56,250 --> 00:41:03,900
OK I have to give the uppermost miasm is cancerus miasm, I give Cancerinum and then

291
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,500
I proceed from there. This is clean work like surgery.

292
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:17,000
It is not just throwing remedies here and there, just because you have some ideas.

293
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,830
And then you see the homeopathic results.

294
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:33,750
Now we go back to this case that we saw. You saw the video.

295
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:45,050
Who thought of Lachesis from the first case? You have to be true to yourself.

296
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:49,360
When you see a case on the video, I let you study the case on the video.

297
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:55,370
Actually I should give you more time to study; but then you have to write down

298
00:41:55,470 --> 00:42:01,010
the remedy. I would prescribe this remedy and then only you can compare your

299
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:03,440
thinking with my thinking.

300
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:11,260
Where did I go wrong? Or I took into consideration this, this and that symptom

301
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:18,180
which is not the correct one. That is how you may correct yourself.

302
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:27,030
That is the value of coming here, to compare your thinking with my thinking.

303
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:40,160
And then you correct yourself, you adjust yourself. Who thought of Lachesis from the first case?

304
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:49,800
-I thought because I took the same remedy for the same subject.

305
00:42:49,900 --> 00:43:00,180
-Very good. You are honest, as usual.

306
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:16,700
You saw all the follow ups or one?
-One.

307
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:32,750
-OK it does not matter. She did quite well on that level which was the emotional level

308
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:41,750
on that case, the emotional case was involved very much plus severe lumbago which

309
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:47,180
might have been also a slip disc situation.

310
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:59,580
Now she comes here to us today two years later and she has a sinusitis.

311
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:15,330
It's not exactly sinusitis, it is a constant discharge from the nose and the question is

312
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:23,350
shall we give a remedy or if we give a remedy, what should be the remedy?

313
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:34,390
I would like to hear from you who says we should still wait?

314
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:46,710
-When was the last one?
-One year ago.

315
00:44:53,210 --> 00:44:56,910
Who says we should give another remedy?

316
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:12,780
The rest what do they say? Nothing.

317
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:20,040
-She took Pulsatilla.

318
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:31,600
-Yes, she took Pulsatilla, the main remedy which has acted was Lachesis which did

319
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:43,860
most of the job and now we take into consideration this fact - Lachesis is the remedy

320
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:48,770
that really has acted- and she comes there with symptoms.

321
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,790
Shall we give a remedy yes or no?

322
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:07,700
-I think we shouldn't because in all her health, she is quite well.

323
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:13,630
She says she is happy, she is content in her life and she tells about this discharge and

324
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:20,100
if I remember well, she doesn't complain really. She only wanted to show you the

325
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:26,460
symptom but in the overall she is quite well, as she's never been.

326
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:31,700
-Not she wanted to show me, this is necessary. Also something else that happened

327
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:41,360
in these seminars which are open and you are not forced to come and give follow up

328
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:46,710
is that, once is better, is finished, he doesn't come anymore to Alonissos.

329
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:55,940
I would like to hear what has happened really. So I need the follow up myself to know

330
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,380
what has happened.

331
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:03,030
So it is good she has come and she has volunteer to come and give a follow up.

332
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:10,640
I'm not sure she really needs desperately a remedy, I don't believe that but it is come

333
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:15,360
she has come here to give a follow up and see what happened after all.

334
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:39,710
Here is a tricky case, why? Because over all she is quite well but there is a temptation.

335
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:53,210
A remedy appears to be indicated now which actually is complementary to Lachesis.

336
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:57,880
And the remedy is Lycopodium.

337
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:10,530
For certain reasons, first of all because the right side is the discharge, the second

338
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:17,800
reason is that she wakes up in the morning and she is unrefreshed.

339
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:30,440
The third reason is that she has some gas and the fourth reason is that she has

340
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:41,110
problems with onions. Actually onions make a Lycopodium case feel very much worse.

341
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:47,960
They have bloatness, even general malaise feeling, it's very bad, it's like poison.

342
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:57,340
Thuja also does not like and Pulsatilla and Nux Vomica. All these remedies they can

343
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:02,090
not tolerate fresh onions.

344
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:13,170
So she has 4 symptoms of Lycopodium, shall we give it yes or no?

345
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:24,840
-No.
-No because she is still happy with Lachesis...

346
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:41,340
-So what shall we say to such a patient?
-What did he say?

347
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:49,730
-He said that the person in general she is quite happy, in good health, so we don't

348
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:55,810
give another remedy. But what can we say?

349
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:11,430
We can say that most probably the remedy which will be indicated later will be Lycopodium.

350
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:14,920
Don't give it, have it in mind that Lycopodium may be needed.

351
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:23,920
So in case she goes into severe acute, to big sinusitis, whatever it might be, then you are

352
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:30,270
ready with this study, you are ready with the next remedy to prescribe.

353
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:41,690
-What level?
-She was A level.

354
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:51,500
-Why did she take Pulsatilla?
-Because most probably she had some symptoms.

355
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:57,690
-If she would say to you I feel fantastic, everything is good but this is really annoying me.

356
00:50:57,790 --> 00:51:01,190
I need to get rid of this, what would you do then?

357
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:09,040
-I may still have waited if that was the symptom, just the discharge.

358
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:13,860
Because the discharge is not a bad thing.

359
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:19,120
Whatever happens with the discharges, you let them go for long time.

360
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:23,570
-But if she gets to a state and says, I've had enough.

361
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:38,370
-No, no. I will say, I also have enough. There are some rules which you have to follow.

362
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:44,140
If you don't follow the rules, you make mistakes. That is a law.

363
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:54,540
You make mistakes and then you will have the problem and the patient.

364
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:59,140
Not only the patient, you also have the problem.

365
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:13,140
It doesn't matter. What it matters is that we have a severe state of emotional stress

366
00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:21,640
which stresses the nervous system on periphery and that is why I say, we have A level.

367
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:37,640
One or two remedies suppose to clear the case. In A level we have acutes which are infrequent.

368
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:53,370
If she eventually gets something acute, it has to be treated but in A level you can ignore

369
00:52:53,470 --> 00:53:01,990
the acutes. You can say, the organism is OK or you give placebo, as much as you like.

370
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:04,220
As much as the patient likes actually.

371
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:15,200
-Now this proves that Lachesis was the first remedy or if you had chosen Lycopodium

372
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:18,310
then later the Lachesis symptom had been more?

373
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:29,640
-I think, I don't remember now but I think we considered Lycopodium in the analysis.

374
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:36,530
Most probably, I don't remember if I have said it, maybe this is going to be the second remedy.

375
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:45,780
But if you give Lycopodium nothing happens. In the beginning, instead of Lachesis

376
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:50,080
you prescribe Lycopodium, forget it, nothing, no effect.

377
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:54,640
-How do you know that?
-I know from experience.

378
00:53:55,890 --> 00:54:02,040
-But the lately symptom, if we think about Lycopodium, and then you take the first

379
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:06,390
layer and then the other layer maybe is Lachesis but...

380
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:15,300
-No. If the first layer is Lachesis you can not replace it by Lycopodium which is the  second layer.

381
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:20,330
If you give Lycopodium, which is second layer, you will confuse the case because

382
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:25,580
symptoms of Lycopodium will try to push up while the Lachesis is on top and

383
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,770
therefore you can forget about curing.

384
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:36,750
She will be aggravated only, especially in this case. No effect at all, if you prescribe

385
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:44,000
first Lycopodium. If you understand that Lycopodium is underneath and then you think

386
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:50,000
maybe she will go later into Lycopodium yes but to give first Lycopodium in the place of

387
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:52,350
Lachesis, forget it only aggravation.

388
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:59,130
In this case only aggravation. In another case just changing of some symptoms.
