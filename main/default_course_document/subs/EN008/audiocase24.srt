1
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:32,020
I'm going to show you a case on which we had the first problem

2
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:41,610
where she comes back and says no effect.

3
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,600
-This patient JK since 1983 she came in with complaints of neuralgia, headaches and

4
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:11,740
frequent colds. She has a history of syphilis 8 years ago from that time and she is treated bad.

5
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:18,740
She also had a stomach ulcer at age 16 and her mother died from stomach cancer

6
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,230
and had alcohol problem and depression.

7
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:27,060
She's had this neuralgia severely for 6 years.

8
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,250
-Where is the neuralgia, in which side?

9
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:32,250
-It is on the right side primarily

10
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:51,790
It began through canals, spreads on the eyes temples and she was very weak at the time.

11
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:59,500
I gave her Mercury 200 and she had brief aggravation, slight amelioration and

12
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,750
just relapsed completely.

13
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:10,810
Then the next visit I saw her she was so much worse cold, very chilly that I gave her...

14
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:34,400
-You gave her Magnesia phosphorica 1M.

15
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:42,980
-I gave her Magnesia phosphorica. Actually I consulted with Roger at the time about the

16
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:52,910
case and we decided that, that was the best choice. Then she had severe crisis.

17
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,390
It became very clear after that and the pain went right to the right eye and she felt a

18
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:13,140
sensation of something in the eye, all the time.

19
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:19,640
She actually described this pain in the right corner of the eye and she was moaning,

20
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:24,640
describing herself that she was crying desperately for the pain and

21
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:29,890
 the feelings were so desperate that she didn't want to continue living.

22
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:36,350
When she came in it was amazing because she waited for the time for visit and then she

23
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:42,810
came in and she sat there and told me the story of how much pain she is been in.

24
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:51,810
I was just amazed why she didn't call me weeks before, she just waited, she is a very nice person.

25
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:07,810
What Roger has said is that Magnesia phosphorica would clear the case.

26
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:13,720
Then she made an aggravation and she was much better and we waited and a week later

27
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:18,980
she relapsed and we repeated the Aurum again.
Then she continued to get better.

28
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:27,980
-What potency?

29
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,010
-One of 50M...

30
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,380
Then she continued to get better gradually, she came in and all the time she was

31
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:44,840
complaining of cramps and I gave her Calcarea 20X and that seemed to help.

32
00:04:53,690 --> 00:05:04,680
Then continued to do well, one time needing a repeated dose of the Aurum 50 M.

33
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:15,090
She came back in November 85 complaining of the neuralgia coming back very badly with

34
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:26,450
bone pain and worse in the right side of the face and at that time I changed remedies

35
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:33,200
because I was concerned that the Aurum 50M is been needed to repeat it so often and

36
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:38,960
I just felt that she would try something else. I don't know if that was a bad decision.

37
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:47,210
I gave her Colocynthis 200 and it seemed to help her quite a bit although it changed the

38
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:53,210
case somewhat and she came back complaining of being superstitious and praying

39
00:05:53,310 --> 00:06:04,710
excessively and emotionally better, energy better and the neuralgic pain better also.

40
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:14,960
So we waited and she is been good for a long time but then she came in again last June

41
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:22,210
complaining of no neuralgia but the bone pain is back and from that she described it to

42
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:32,460
me as sinus pain and I'm the one who used the word bone pain...

43
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:40,960
It's a pressing around the bones in the sinus area, pressing out the pain,

44
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,550
as she describes, and it's deep aching pain.

45
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,310
-On the right side?

46
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:51,050
-Yes on the right side and around the eyes.

47
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:58,730
Her menses are much better from Colocynthis and she has got a chronic allergy type for

48
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:08,260
some time now and she is main functioning much better with doing her own shopping and

49
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:16,020
as the years went by she was quite disabled, she couldn't work, she couldn't go to school.

50
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,350
When symptoms began she was in College. She had to drop it.

51
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:27,840
So she is functioning but she still wants to go back to school and still she can't do that.

52
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:34,430
Also superstitiousness and praying is very strong, complaining of bones aching all over

53
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:41,270
and then she described this mental state of being feeling stupid as if her mind was really

54
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:50,260
deteriorating and has difficulty in concentrating and even felt what am I doing there?

55
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:57,590
She has just feelings like that sometimes, like her mind is just crumpling, as she described it.

56
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:05,850
At that time I thought she could go back to one of those remedies

57
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:09,930
but I really thought it could be good for you to see this case.

58
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,720
-What is this test?

59
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:25,070
-Epstein Barr virus. The virus is a mono-nucleosis virus and people are getting this condition

60
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,440
chronically.

61
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:37,910
They discovered it as a chronic condition with myalgias, with sore throats, colds and

62
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,940
sometimes chronic fever.

63
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:51,450
She had a titer of 1:60 which is moderate, it's not very high.

64
00:08:51,550 --> 00:09:03,040
1:10 is normal and 1:60 or less indicates exposure to the virus and it goes way up to the thousands.

65
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:24,860
Again you see the same story here. She was better, worse, better, worse, better, worse

66
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:30,610
after 2-3 years of treatment, still the same state of health.

67
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:39,550
This is what I was talking about touching really the layers, treating the layers

68
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:44,800
which is a different sense all together.

69
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,130
Let's see.

70
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:19,450
-Do you have anything in your skin?

71
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,660
-Acne?

72
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,420
-No, I mean make-up.

73
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,750
-Yes, I do.

74
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,250
-Is it always very pale your skin?

75
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,700
-Yes I don't like the sun very much but it is naturally pale.

76
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,570
-You don't like the sun?

77
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,820
-No, I avoid the sun purposefully.

78
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,330
-You avoid the sun in order to?

79
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,770
What do you observe?

80
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,730
-Stiffness.

81
00:10:48,830 --> 00:11:02,190
-It's very prominent the stiffness. It is a stiffness of what?

82
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:03,970
-Expression.

83
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:18,780
-Of expression mostly, an inner stiffness. Why? Why she is like that?

84
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:30,030
Because she is in pain? What is the reason for her being in this kind of stiffness?

85
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:47,520
-Certain insecurity.

86
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,600
-It's a symptom.

87
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,860
-Yes.

88
00:11:53,960 --> 00:12:03,160
-She is holding herself up in a posture, in a position. Can you tell me why she is like that?

89
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:17,010
What she is afraid of? Like she is afraid of breaking the eggs? Why?

90
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:30,840
She is going to be like a mummy. Not the mother...

91
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:40,800
This is the impression she gives. Very important, why?

92
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:50,240
What is a mummy? Mummy is a human being who has everything else except what?

93
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,590
-Life.

94
00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:00,240
-Life. You don't see life in her. It's not flowing the life.

95
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:09,590
Something has frozen her. She is frozen.

96
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:17,910
Why we are interested about this expression? For different reasons.

97
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:25,160
One is of course to give us an indication about the remedy and whether we can fit that

98
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,240
expression with what we know about the remedies.

99
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:35,500
The second thing we are interested about this expression is to know the actual depth of

100
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,580
the pathology.

101
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:49,580
This is a post-syphilitic condition? You may have these severe pains?

102
00:13:51,170 --> 00:14:00,080
But how deep is the whole condition? It is depicted upon her appearance because there is

103
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,760
lack of life. There is tremendous lack of life, lack of vivacity.

104
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:12,180
What we are dealing with all the time, the element with which we are handling and we are

105
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:21,670
manipulating is this element of vitality, how much vitality is there, how much defenses are

106
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:24,430
there to stimulate.

107
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:34,430
In her it appears that everything has gone out, very little has been left in her. Let's see.

108
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,760
-But not that the sun bothers you?

109
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,510
-Not really.

110
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:44,260
-Do you like heat?

111
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:53,760
-I do, I can be very warm. I feel a kind of headache but virtually I like it.

112
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:12,430
-Do you want to describe how you feel?

113
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:21,430
-Right now OK. I have some pain today, sometimes it's been worse than today.

114
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:28,370
It feels like a bad cold or a flu, it's pretty much all over my body pains and aches but

115
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:33,070
sometimes it feels like pain in my head. Sometimes I have a really big pressure, like

116
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,320
headache.

117
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:50,430
It feels a kind of rock in here. It's usually around my eyes and my sinuses and my throat.

118
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:06,620
It's hard to describe exactly where it is .

119
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,120
-I'm sorry I don't understand you speak a little bit fast. That's my problem.

120
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,970
What did you say?

121
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:19,700
-A kind of in the roof of her mouth.

122
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,730
-As if it was something there?

123
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:32,210
-Like a sinus headache, it feels like over flesh between the roof of my mouth and behind

124
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:39,040
my nose and behind my eyes is so aching, it feels like a bad cold.

125
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:56,460
-What else do you feel?

126
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:02,460
-I have aches and pains especially in my upper body but also in my legs and arms and

127
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,960
shoulders, you know just aches.

128
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,210
-When did you develop all these pains?

129
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:16,170
-It started six years ago and before I had another kind of pain that has gradually got

130
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:21,050
better. That was a neuralgia.

131
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:26,250
That was like a toothache and sometimes it was in my eye. Now it is like a toothache and

132
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,790
sometimes it is in my eye.

133
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:32,340
-These pains now they are worse than what they used to be or they are better?

134
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,920
-They are better now.

135
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:39,670
-All these pains and the feelings in the head?

136
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:43,860
-Yes.

137
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,360
-What else do you have?

138
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:55,860
-It is really like a broken up especially the last six months, it's not too bad today but

139
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:00,370
usually my skin is all broken up here and here.

140
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:10,450
I find very hard to sleep at night, even if I'm tired and I sleep in midnight, I find it very hard

141
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:11,940
to get to sleep.

142
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,980
-What time do you finally go to sleep? It is late when you go to sleep?

143
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:22,200
Or you wake up in between?

144
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,270
-Sometimes I wake up in the night.

145
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,530
-What is the usual pattern?

146
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:40,780
-It's usually when I go to sleep 3,4,5 in the morning. Usually when I get to sleep, I can stay

147
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:53,120
asleep until I got an hour of sleep. Sometimes if I'm feeling particularly bad, it takes 10

148
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:59,370
hours to make me feel I have had enough sleep.

149
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:05,210
-When you go to sleep at 3 o' clock you continue until 11 o'clock in the morning?

150
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,460
-Usually yes.

151
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:12,710
-Why it takes you so long to go to sleep? You are excited, a lot of thinking?

152
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:17,960
What is the reason?

153
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:23,460
-I don't know, sometimes I'm thinking a lot but often even if I'm very sleepy it just feels that

154
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:31,950
my mind doesn't want to enter into sleep. It's like my mind and my body can't make me

155
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:39,460
adjust from being awake to being to sleep. I don't really know why.

156
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:44,960
I don't think it's particularly because I'm anxious, although sometimes but not usually.

157
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:14,870
The pain that I described to you is worse in the morning, when I first get up and at night

158
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:20,230
and sometimes it keeps me awake.

159
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:36,870
-How long it will take you before you are better with the pains? Five minutes,

160
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,370
 three minutes or half an hour?

161
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,280
-More than half an hour and sometimes several hours.

162
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,460
-Before you could feel better.

163
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,490
-Yes.

164
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,490
-So you just wake up in the morning and what you do?

165
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:55,330
You walk in the house or you go out for a walk?

166
00:20:55,430 --> 00:21:01,830
-Sometimes I walk and sometimes I have some place that I have to go but I if I don't have

167
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:06,320
to go anywhere then in half an hour I just fix myself something to eat and watch television

168
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:10,070
and I read.

169
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:14,660
-Do you like your life?

170
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,410
-It's OK except of the pains.

171
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:23,410
-What are your interests?

172
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,420
-I read.

173
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,000
-What are you reading?

174
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:39,240
-I read the newspapers a lot, I like to read many fictions and I have friends that

175
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:46,990
I'm interested in, I spend time talking to them on the phone and sometimes visiting them.

176
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:50,740
It's hard for me to get to them, so if they can they come to me.

177
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,530
-Are you religious?

178
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,360
-Yes.

179
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,610
-You are very religious?

180
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:58,950
-Yes, I pray a lot. I feel it very strongly.

181
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:02,490
-Is this praying a compulsion?

182
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:09,910
-Sometimes yes, you mean that I feel sorry for other creatures...

183
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:12,910
-No, that you have to do it, you have to pray.

184
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:16,910
-Yes sometimes it is.

185
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:19,910
-That you have to pray and you pray constantly.

186
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:24,940
-Often I do it, not to that point but often I do it because I feel fearful.

187
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,440
-What are you afraid of?

188
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:34,940
-I have a friend who has a heart condition, I worry about him, that's some reason to

189
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:41,180
worry and I worry about my father but sometimes it's irrational. I think of them and just

190
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,930
even thinking about their death...

191
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,680
I'm very superstitious.

192
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:58,180
-Very superstitious kind of thinking.

193
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:26,940
What symptoms are you looking now?

194
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:35,820
What kind of praying, what kind of person it is, what kind of life she is living?

195
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:42,420
-Stiffness, superstitious.

196
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:51,760
-Loneliness.

197
00:23:55,010 --> 00:24:05,760
-Who sees loneliness in this case?

198
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:25,590
What do you see as her main characteristic? Why she is praying?

199
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:34,840
Because it is a pathology, it is a symptom, she is praying too much but why she is praying?

200
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:41,590
 Can anybody tell me and analyze the case?

201
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,750
-Fear.

202
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:51,990
-Fear of her welfare.

203
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:54,030
-Fear of guilt.

204
00:24:54,130 --> 00:25:00,130
-Why, because of syphilis?

205
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:05,080
-Consolating.

206
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:09,830
-It is consolating her the praying.

207
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:17,830
-She is fighting in herself.

208
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:21,580
-Fighting between what?

209
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:28,430
-To make contact with the outside world.

210
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:38,350
-Fear of getting insane.

211
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:52,830
-I'll give you a description and tell me if you don't agree, what I see in her.

212
00:25:52,930 --> 00:26:01,580
She comes and she sits there lifeless. I see no life.

213
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:08,160
Then I get certain information about that person who is lifeless, that she has a lot of pains.

214
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:15,740
But the pains have been ameliorated but what I see is lifeless.

215
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:21,920
Then this person does not work. What she does? She sleeps.

216
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:29,010
From 3 o'clock till 11 or 12. What you do in the morning, I ask.

217
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:37,510
She says, I'm reading. What do you read? Newspapers.

218
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:46,710
What else you are doing? I'm talking to some friends in the telephone.

219
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:54,360
Now imagine her life. You have to imagine her life to understand.

220
00:26:54,460 --> 00:27:01,830
It is important for us when we prescribe to go deep into the case and prescribe deep,

221
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:06,330
to change matters. Otherwise you will never change.

222
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:10,660
Give as much Aurum as you like and this case will not change,

223
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,550
it will become more and more depressed.

224
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:18,810
You have to find the remedy that fits the essence in this case, what we call the essence

225
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:23,800
now, here you have to prescribe on essence.

226
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:29,550
Unless you understand that essence and fit it with the remedy, as you know the remedy

227
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:37,040
to be, and what limitation this remedy  has, you will never succeed in this case.

228
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:42,380
Imagine this, why she doesn't move?

229
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:50,500
There are certain movements, what an individual does but there is another individual who

230
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:56,250
is careful about every motion, she appears to be very careful about every motion she

231
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,620
does. Is she dressed well?

232
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:03,680
-No.

233
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,170
-No, you don't like her dress?

234
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:11,920
I don't ask you whether you like the color of the dress etc. What I'm asking is whether you

235
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:22,450
get the impression whatever she wears, whether she is neat. Is she neat?

236
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,960
Is she neat?

237
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:24,710
-Yes.

238
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:26,040
-Is she clean?

239
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,080
-Yes.

240
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,870
-Her combing of the hair... Have you noticed the combing of the hair?

241
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:41,210
All the hair goes right through, not up and down, 3/4 of the hair in this side and 1/4 in that side.

242
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:52,220
She is sitting there and she looks very lifeless and she will not move, why?

243
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,460
She gives you the impression that if she moves she will spoil her hair, the hair perhaps

244
00:28:55,560 --> 00:29:01,540
will go up and down, perhaps she will spoil the posture.

245
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:09,040
The posture is very important now for her, the appearance is very important.

246
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:15,800
But what is the life of this person? Living in a house without working.

247
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:22,790
She is unable to work, living in a house, opening the TV, reading the newspapers,

248
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:27,790
speaking in the phone and worrying. Worrying about whom?

249
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:38,290
About others, her father, a friend who has a heart problem and she is worrying about

250
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:56,880
others. Very limited life. Very lonely life.

251
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:00,880
You don't see the loneliness in this case?

252
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,960
When I asked you, only five people put up your hands.

253
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:11,040
You don't see loneliness? You don't see this lifeless person, living by herself,

254
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:17,540
completely isolated, gone inside?

255
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:25,630
She is gone completely inside, introverted without any life left to her, without any freedom.

256
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:33,740
She is restricted in a room. What she does? Just reading newspapers every day,

257
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:40,640
lookingbat the television, talk to some friends perhaps.

258
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:49,540
Not working, not doing anything, limited, lonely, tremendous loneliness and

259
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,620
now it comes the question of praying.

260
00:30:54,400 --> 00:31:02,020
She is praying why? With so much loneliness inside, there is no contact.

261
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:06,020
She is dying, she is wasting away from life, going away.

262
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:11,020
Therefore she needs something to hold on, she needs some contact somewhere but

263
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,520
 there is no human being to have contact with her.

264
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:26,020
It doesn't exist, she cannot form this kind of relationship, therefore she is holding with god.

265
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:31,770
She has to pray because it gives some kind of consolation, some kind of grip because of

266
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:38,270
the loneliness, tremendous loneliness, limitedness and restriction.

267
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:43,520
Imagine this person day after a day, what a pain, what a misery.

268
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:50,270
This is the impression I get and here she is standing there not to spoil her hair, it's very

269
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:53,110
important. She moves very slowly, otherwise her hair...

270
00:31:53,210 --> 00:32:01,100
And I see her sitting neatly there and tremendous coldness.

271
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,940
The practitioner said she felt so cold after the remedy.

272
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:10,990
She gave her Mercury and then she was feeling so cold.

273
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:42,080
Syphilitic pains, those that they know the Materia Medica they get the idea.

274
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:55,820
What is the difference between you and me is that I take all the information inside,

275
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:01,020
I don't take what she says. What she says I don't even hear.

276
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:09,290
She says I have a pain here and there...It is not important. She is dying, there is no life.

277
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:15,360
What is happening? Now the pain here and there is that important?

278
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,810
Maybe, if you have a keynote of something but

279
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:23,850
what is important is the essence of this case.

280
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:31,610
What is the essence in this case, what appears to be?

281
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:43,860
After the analysis the whole class can say. What?

282
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:53,860
Look at praying.

283
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:13,450
What is the remedy?

284
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,490
-Veratrum.

285
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:21,630
-Veratrum? Veratrum is full of life and energy.

286
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:31,140
Feeling cold so much, dressed properly, meticulously.

287
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:34,140
Anxiety about others, look at anxiety about others.

288
00:34:49,160 --> 00:35:00,300
Dressed very neatly, carefully, everything is very careful.

289
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:36,500
Freezing coldness.

290
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:48,290
What is your prescription now?

291
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:49,280
-Arsenicum.

292
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:56,830
-Who says Arsenicum?

293
00:35:56,930 --> 00:36:02,090
I analyzed the facts. I didn't give you anything more than the facts.

294
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:08,410
I just constructed the facts.

295
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:14,420
Could anybody argue with the facts I gave you about this case? I projected a little with my

296
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:25,840
imagination, a little bit but not too much, because you can see she is doing nothing.

297
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:36,840
Can you imagine a person doing nothing every day?

298
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:43,340
Is it possible that this person is happy? No. Is it possible that she is lonely?

299
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:50,830
Yes she is very lonely, that is why she is praying.

300
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:54,330
It is not the praying of Aurum.

301
00:36:54,430 --> 00:37:05,410
Aurum, I said it again and again. It is a compulsive praying for hours, no end.

302
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:10,920
It's a crazy situation, the same with the Veratrum album.

303
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:16,920
The praying of the Veratrum album has nothing to do with what she says.

304
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:21,670
Praying of the Veratrum album will be a person who goes out in the streets and say

305
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:30,750
repent, repent... a crazy person, who goes out and talks, he is crazy.

306
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:40,330
He is praying in front of others, he doesn't mind, he shouts. Have you seen this?

307
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:45,450
No, they close in the asylums all these cases.

308
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:57,510
This is not the case. She is praying in almost a logical way.

309
00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:07,410
When praying is pathology because not everybody who prays is a nut but here we have pathology.

310
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:13,000
When we say Veratrum is praying, it prays in this way.

311
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:28,340
It prays very actively, it is shouting, it has the religious thing, it is the mental pathology in

312
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,590
Veratrum album.

313
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:38,080
In Aurum it will kneel down and pray for hours because the depression is so big.

314
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:49,090
It has to have an outlet of the depression, that's why Aurum is praying and

315
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:54,420
 as soon as it stops praying, the depression overwhelms.

316
00:38:54,520 --> 00:39:05,520
Here it is a person who needs some contact. She has to have something to hold on.

317
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:11,760
She has lost everything and if you don't reach that emotional state...you don't reach easily.

318
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,650
She has gone through big shocks.

319
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:15,650
What happened in her life we shall find out but

320
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:25,810
this is a situation where the person has gone through tremendous mental suffering to

321
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:30,300
arrive at that stage and we see it's terrible.

322
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:40,560
I've seen mental pathology and mental pathology is very deep.

323
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:47,060
-Why not Syphillinum? Superstitious, night aggravation, bone pains, tidy?

324
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:56,130
-Yes but the element of being dressed and being so proper, she will not even do a

325
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:05,950
movement that may be improper.

326
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:11,790
And also when we will put back the case you will hear the practitioner saying my god

327
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:26,140
she was freezing cold together with the anxiety about others, which she herself volunteers,

328
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,290
Arsenicum again.

329
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:36,550
Arsenicum freezing, Arsenicum anxiety about others, a praying, night aggravation yes

330
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:43,540
Arsenicum, syphilitic remedy yes Arsenicum. Why should you go away from Arsenicum?

331
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:53,790
You cannot.

332
00:40:53,890 --> 00:41:02,700
This is a case of Arsenicum, as we said yesterday, I would like to show you a little bit more.

333
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:11,200
The idea is for this seminar to understand some aspects of Arsenicum.

334
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:17,290
What you have seen is a typical aspect of Arsenicum.

335
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:25,540
The way that an Arsenicum presents herself or himself is this way.

336
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:44,040
In this case it is a little bit accentuated, a little bit too much, this kind of perfection.

337
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:50,540
This kind of attitude which limits the individual who needs Arsenicum.

338
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:56,580
The individual who needs Arsenicum is limited by the appearances and what he sees and

339
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:02,290
what he wears and how he is. It's very limited.

340
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:06,120
Every Arsenicum will sit down like that.

341
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:16,630
It is in our Materia Medica, it is described the man or the woman who is very well dressed.

342
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:35,130
It is not very well dressed and is agile but he must not have creases.

343
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:42,710
An Arsenicum can wear the same clothes one week and you think he just put it on.

344
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:46,880
It says he little spoils his clothes, why? Because of that attitude.

345
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:56,130
He sits in that position, he will take of these things so much.

346
00:42:56,230 --> 00:43:06,620
When an Arsenicum talks, he cannot talk like me, I cannot be Arsenicum. Never.

347
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:18,880
The Arsenicum will be talking like that, like that. This here, never.

348
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:32,650
It's an impulse, it's a compulsion for Arsenicum and you will see it again and again in

349
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:43,130
a different form, perhaps less or sometimes more but this is the aspect.

350
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:56,630
When I hear the practitioner I was impressed by the way she was feeling so much cold,

351
00:43:56,730 --> 00:44:03,960
the syphilitic pains ...and there she comes. You don't need more, you can prescribe but

352
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:09,490
here the idea is not to prescribe, is to teach.

353
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:22,450
I would like to show you the aspects of Arsenicum. This case is so beautiful.

354
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:33,050
An Arsenicum has to be in order outside and inside.

355
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:44,130
A child sleeps, it is with fever and the mother comes to make the bed and the bed has to

356
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:55,040
be intact, immaculately, otherwise she is restless, she cannot tolerate the bed undone.

357
00:44:55,140 --> 00:45:00,790
The person is limited, this is a symptom.

358
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:05,690
You may say order is a good thing, it is but up to a certain extend.

359
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:09,440
Once it is carried too far...

360
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:18,640
Why we say desire fruits is a symptom? Is it bad to eat fruits? No, but in order to have

361
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:28,230
desire fruits as a symptom, it has to be really gone very far because everybody likes fruits

362
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:34,450
except of Ignatia and Baryta carbonica and a few other remedies.

363
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:42,950
But in order to put it as desire fruits, it has to be real desire to say I have lived with fruits.

364
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:51,450
I can eat constantly fruits. Then you have a symptom.

365
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:58,050
Order, most people will like order, it doesn't mean that it's a symptom and you give

366
00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:03,540
Arsenicum. He says I'm orderly, you don't give.

367
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:09,030
You give when the symptom becomes a limit, like this.

368
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:15,800
Now all her life she is limited. You will see the limitation of Arsenicum here.

369
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:28,130
She cannot go outside of her routine, she cannot communicate and interact.

370
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:34,710
Arsenicum cannot easily interact with others because this order prevents him.

371
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:39,380
It is easily disgusted, he wants order.

372
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:47,640
He wants time to fix his own things, putting up his clothes, it is a whole ceremony for him.

373
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:56,130
I told you a case of a doctor, we went to the sea to swim. So we finished swimming and I

374
00:46:56,230 --> 00:47:05,380
dressed completely and he had just put on his...

375
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:18,300
And I was waiting and waiting to finish dressing. Now he goes to the shoes and I expect

376
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:27,390
he will take the lace and then he would take the two laces and measure them.

377
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:31,640
And the one was a little bit more than the other and then he would get it down and

378
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:34,650
measure it again and it was very little.

379
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:41,890
I was watching all this thing and I said my god he needs Arsenicum.

380
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:48,800
Then I said come on man, he said I'm coming, I'm coming. He wanted to be exact to be able

381
00:47:48,900 --> 00:48:03,550
to tie his shoe laces. That kind of thing. This is the idea. Perfection.

382
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:09,190
It's impossible to be exactly the same thing here, what is there.

383
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:23,190
This idea you will perceive immediately in an Arsenicum case and when you see it,

384
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:32,440
it behaves like Arsenicum. The face is clean, even her hair...

385
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:46,100
I'll put 20 other women dressed in the same way and with the hair in front and you will see

386
00:48:46,200 --> 00:49:01,110
the hair is not perfect and she is perfect.

387
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:10,850
Arsenicum is exhausted, the exhaustion of Arsenicum and at the same time restless.

388
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:17,190
Now you will say where is the restlessness here? There is no more life to be restless

389
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:26,520
here. It's so much lifeless.

390
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:38,520
I would like to see some other aspects of her.

391
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:49,490
-I happen not liking myself and feeling terrible and I don't feel like that.

392
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:50,440
-You enjoy life now?

393
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:58,770
-Yes I do. Sometimes I'm feeling absolutely the worse physically and

394
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:01,600
then sometimes I wonder how I can take it, I can go on.

395
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:06,860
-Then you feel that you want to end your life?

396
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:18,110
-I haven't really thought about that but I'm afraid that I would. It's really terrible.

397
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:23,100
Did you see a desire to commit suicide?

398
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:29,690
If you go to the Repertory suicidal disposition, you will see Aurum and you will see Natrum

399
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:34,550
sulphuricum and I have said about Arsenicum, when I did the differential diagnosis I said

400
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:49,670
Arsenicum, it is in italics? I think it is italics.

401
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:54,010
-Yes.

402
00:50:54,110 --> 00:51:04,100
-I said that Arsenicum commits suicide, it is of those remedies that they can commit

403
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:08,750
suicide. They are other remedies that have the tendency, the impulse but

404
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:13,330
different other things prevent them.

405
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:18,750
Arsenicum is of the remedies that they really can commit suicide.

406
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:34,240
The idea behind Arsenicum is that she does not really enjoy life, it is too much for her and

407
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:37,000
she will decide to do it.

408
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:51,510
But she decides to do it, it's going to be almost a logical decision, I can't live.

409
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:58,740
What she says is, I'm enjoying life. This is not enjoying life you understand.

410
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:04,580
You will see more how she cannot enjoy life and she is not enjoying life.

411
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:19,080
Why this case cannot be Aurum? We differentiate now between Aurum and Arsenicum.

412
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:21,320
Because Aurum would have expressed...

413
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:34,830
If it does express the suicidal disposition, he says thinking of death is a very good

414
00:52:34,930 --> 00:52:41,110
possibility, it is a very good outlet, this is the idea with Aurum.

415
00:52:41,210 --> 00:53:08,330
It is a relief, if I could die, it would be a relief. Either this or it does not express it at all.

416
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:16,810
Therefore in this case, I would have taken that piece and I would say

417
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:19,530
 what remedy can be this?

418
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:32,880
I would have extracted that piece where she says I don't really want but sometimes I have

419
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:39,380
been wanting to do it, this is not an expression of Aurum.

420
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:46,980
Aurum is deeper than this. It is a relief.

421
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:53,220
Aurum is somebody who all the time thinks about death.

422
00:53:53,320 --> 00:54:14,560
On the background it is death. Whatever he does is death behind in his thinking.

423
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:19,060
-It all takes a little bit of relief...

424
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:31,140
-What is the history before? What else did you have before it started?

425
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:36,890
-I didn't have physically something.

426
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:40,640
-What did you feel that you had?

427
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:48,640
-I had a terrible experience in school, my parents transferred me into another school

428
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:54,380
because I had a fight with a teacher and that was terrible, I didn't have any friends for

429
00:54:54,480 --> 00:55:00,630
almost three years and the other kids picked on me. I felt I can't ever go entirely over that

430
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:03,670
experience.

431
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:06,060
-What age that was?

432
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:13,650
-I was 10 when I went to that school and I was 13 when I went back to the public school.

433
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:20,220
-This was the first painful experience you had?

434
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:26,720
-I think so. I remember my parent fighting but that didn't bother me,

435
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:33,220
I don't remember being really terrible before that.

436
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:39,730
I did have a lot of colds when I was little and the doctor told my parents to...

437
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:51,810
sister and I used to get colds and respiratory infections and I was getting a lot of...

438
00:55:51,910 --> 00:56:04,640
 that stained my teeth but other I don't remember when I was young.

439
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:13,970
-Did you feel that you are a closed person or open?

440
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:16,140
-I'm closed.

441
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,890
-Very closed?

442
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:21,890
-I'm open to my friends.

443
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:23,320
-You have a lot of friends?

444
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:27,550
-Not a lot but I have a few very good friends.

445
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:32,630
-A few? Let's say 2-3?

446
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:35,390
-Three very, very good friends.

447
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:37,230
-You talk to them for what happens?

448
00:56:37,330 --> 00:56:38,220
-Yes.

449
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:42,570
-Everything that happens in you, you will talk?

450
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:45,310
-Yes.

451
00:56:45,410 --> 00:56:51,580
-There is nothing that you want to hide from them that you don't want to talk to anybody?

452
00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:56,720
Is anything that bothers you inside that you don't want to talk to anybody?

453
00:56:56,820 --> 00:57:03,970
-Nothing that bothers me. I have one or two secrets that I haven't talked to anybody but

454
00:57:04,070 --> 00:57:09,220
most things I do discuss.

455
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:17,260
-About these two secrets do you feel that they have affected your life really?

456
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:32,310
-I don't think so, I think they are just things that are private. I don't think about them often.

457
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:35,810
-You were always have been a closed person?

458
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:45,390
-That was probably more when I went to the private school.

459
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:48,640
-Do you have a relationship, a boyfriend?

460
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:54,980
-No but I have an ex-boyfriend who is really my best friend, we are very close.

461
00:57:55,080 --> 00:58:00,730
-How long before you have been together?

462
00:58:00,830 --> 00:58:04,810
-About 10 years ago.

463
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:11,810
-For how long?

464
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:16,560
-For two years.

465
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:21,980
-Did you have full relationship? Did you have sexual relationship?

466
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:29,570
-When it was your first sexual experience?

467
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:34,660
-When I was 18.

468
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:38,410
-You were functioning OK in that respect?

469
00:58:38,510 --> 00:58:41,750
-I think so.

470
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:44,250
-And now what do you feel?

471
00:58:44,350 --> 00:58:52,740
-I'd like to have a boyfriend but I don't feel I suffer terribly from the lack of, I'd rather...

472
00:58:52,840 --> 00:59:00,910
than to have somebody whom I don't go along with,

473
00:59:01,010 --> 00:59:04,680
then I have to make a lot of painful compromises.

474
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:12,170
-At this moment would you say that you have an aversion for sex?

475
00:59:12,270 --> 00:59:28,150
-No I don't think so, I'm a little afraid of getting involved but not an aversion.

476
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:56,550
What I'm driving at is I want to understand how she came into that psychological state.

477
00:59:56,650 --> 01:00:10,880
What I perceive is that she had some very severe grief that was so much affected her life,

478
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:17,060
she has almost lost her life, she was withdrawn completely and

479
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:22,810
 became like a mummy which she is now.

480
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:30,810
How a human being becomes like that unless there is a very powerful grief.

481
01:00:30,910 --> 01:00:35,090
What kind of grief was that? I try to understand.

482
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:38,090
I try to see in the relationship what was happening.

483
01:00:38,190 --> 01:00:41,340
 Somebody must have said something terrible to her.

484
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:45,850
This is what I feel, like a boyfriend said something very nasty and then

485
01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:54,550
 she was hurt very much.
How one can become like that?

486
01:00:54,650 --> 01:01:01,480
For me it is a very severe mental state.

487
01:01:24,490 --> 01:01:27,400
-Are you a restless person?

488
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,220
-I'm pretty restless.

489
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:35,390
-Can you give an example of what you do?

490
01:01:35,490 --> 01:01:43,890
-I find it hard to stand still like now that I'm sitting here I'm pretty tensed.

491
01:01:43,990 --> 01:01:49,390
That is a very interesting comment, you see outside very little restlessness.

492
01:01:49,490 --> 01:02:01,140
But inside she feels this restlessness, she describes it.

493
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:11,730
-I don't feel very comfortable sitting still.

494
01:02:11,830 --> 01:02:20,980
But often I don't want to move, if I over exert myself and there is the pain on and I feel

495
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:28,740
tired in such a way that I just don't want to move.

496
01:02:28,990 --> 01:02:32,970
Do you see the expression? Did you understand what she said?

497
01:02:32,990 --> 01:02:41,640
She said if I move, if I exert, I feel such tiredness that finally I don't want to move, I try to

498
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:46,390
avoid moving because if I move, I feel very tired.

499
01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:52,140
This is exactly what is the Arsenicum case.

500
01:02:52,240 --> 01:03:03,720
If you go to the Materia Medica Kent describes it the person is restless, it is exhausted

501
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:11,560
and he has to move from one bed to the other, from one chair to the other until finally

502
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:17,140
he lies completely exhausted. This is what she describes.

503
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:20,900
She says if I keep on moving, I get so much exhausted that

504
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:37,240
I know I'm going to end up exhausted.

505
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:49,980
This is a very typical Arsenicum case, anxiety about others, praying, coldness,

506
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:58,730
this kind of fastidious appearance...

507
01:03:58,830 --> 01:04:05,480
-I have weakness along with the pain like if I pick up a cloth and wear it,

508
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:08,560
it feels like a waste of time.

509
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:12,560
-So much? Do you do exercise?

510
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:21,220
-I just walk, I do some symmetric exercise.

511
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:32,390
-You complain about feeling in the mind that you cannot concentrate, you cannot understand.

512
01:04:32,490 --> 01:04:35,730
Can you describe what is happening?

513
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:40,480
-If I'm reading a difficult paragraph, sometimes I read it several times and

514
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:52,810
 I don't actually grasp, it's hard to concentrate.

515
01:04:52,910 --> 01:05:05,310
Do you see? A remedy when it has a peculiar symptomatology, in one way or another,

516
01:05:05,410 --> 01:05:10,560
you may perceive this peculiarity of the remedy in all three levels.

517
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:18,230
The restlessness, which is in the physical body can be perceived in the mental sphere

518
01:05:18,330 --> 01:05:25,610
 as well and an Arsenicum person cannot concentrate and his mind wonders.

519
01:05:25,710 --> 01:05:31,440
There is a restlessness on the mind that it cannot sit still and concentrate in one point,

520
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:33,990
that's what she says.

521
01:05:34,090 --> 01:05:39,660
Not that every Arsenicum will have affection on three levels but you may not find the

522
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:55,660
restlessness on the physical level and you find it on the mental level or the emotional level.

523
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:11,320
-Often I just wonder why trying to concentrate on something I get distracted.

524
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:53,210
-When you lie in bed...

525
01:06:53,310 --> 01:07:02,210
-Usually when I'm tired and sleepy then I go to bed and then it starts getting worse.

526
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:07,470
-And in bed you are restless? You cannot keep a position for a long period of time?

527
01:07:07,570 --> 01:07:09,660
You have to change positions?

528
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:17,410
-Yes constantly quite a bit. I think now I fall asleep but before...

529
01:07:17,510 --> 01:07:21,400
-Do you have a special position where you want to sleep?

530
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:27,200
-usually lying on the one side

531
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:32,570
-what kind of food do you eat?

532
01:07:32,670 --> 01:07:41,190
-Sardines and mustard. Salty things, very salty.

533
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,930
Do you see?

534
01:07:51,330 --> 01:07:57,060
If you don't take into consideration all the other things that we have talked about

535
01:07:57,160 --> 01:08:06,060
she says now what I like is sardines and salty things and you see grief and salty and

536
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:11,560
 you take these two and you give Natrum muriaticum.

537
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:20,400
And you miss the case because this is not a case of Natrum muriaticum.

538
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:35,400
You see the fastidiousness in the appearance, this deadness, this attitude.

539
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:50,900
You don't have the Nat mur but also the praying, the freezing, the feeling of the coldness,

540
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,740
you will not find this in Nat mur.

541
01:08:53,840 --> 01:09:00,990
There are a lot of points against Nat mur and in favor of Arsenicum.

542
01:09:01,090 --> 01:09:06,490
There is desire for salt and finally you go to the Repertory and

543
01:09:06,590 --> 01:09:14,240
 you look is there any desire for salt for Arsenicum? No.

544
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:21,000
So it means either that Arsenicum has desire for salt but it is not recorded in the Repertory or

545
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:27,820
 later after the Arsenicum you may have another remedy coming up that has

546
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:36,440
desire for salt and either Arsenicum will take away the desire for salt or it will remain and

547
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:46,990
it will be the characteristic of another underlined remedy.

548
01:09:50,090 --> 01:10:05,730
-I do have bread and carbohydrates and sweets, definitely sweets.

549
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:08,210
-More salt or sweet?

550
01:10:08,310 --> 01:10:13,450
-Both, equally.

551
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:22,450
And I get ferociously hungry before my period.

552
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:55,540
Weakness, I also feel that sometimes any effort is a big work,

553
01:10:55,640 --> 01:11:00,120
 just to get dressed sometimes is a huge task.

554
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:02,740
-You feel so tired?

555
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:09,280
-Yes very tired and weak and the pain makes it hard, just to get anything done,

556
01:11:09,380 --> 01:11:12,030
 just to walk around.

557
01:11:12,130 --> 01:11:21,950
Sometimes I feel so exasperated, oh god it is a huge task just to do the simplest thing.

558
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:33,200
Sometimes I feel mentally that life is very hard and I feel overwhelmed by anything that

559
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:39,710
I have to do just to survive.

560
01:11:39,810 --> 01:11:45,950
 Sometimes I don't get the bills paid, my house doesn't get clean...

561
01:11:46,050 --> 01:12:14,970
Look at your Repertory, 1419, 1418 look at the rubric weakness from pain.

562
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:38,140
Also she said I feel so exasperated because of that situation.

563
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:45,790
Translate it into the language of the Repertory.

564
01:12:45,890 --> 01:12:57,980
Despair of what? Of recovery. That she will not get well.

565
01:12:58,220 --> 01:13:15,210
Look at the page 36 for despair of recovery.

566
01:13:15,310 --> 01:13:24,950
She is freezing, restless, praying, dressed as she is, weak from pain,

567
01:13:25,050 --> 01:13:36,560
big effort to do anything, suicidal disposition.

568
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:51,920
You are a graduating class, so you should go away from the description of the letter,

569
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:57,920
as it is. Go to the essence of things.

570
01:13:58,020 --> 01:14:10,750
From a description of a rubric like despair for recovery and weakness from pain,

571
01:14:10,850 --> 01:14:16,510
construct a human being with your imagination.

572
01:14:16,610 --> 01:14:22,840
Because what you are dealing is not a rubric, you are dealing with a human being on a

573
01:14:22,940 --> 01:14:24,950
three dimensional size.

574
01:14:25,050 --> 01:14:34,760
The rubrics are giving you hints but what you have to do is the suffering.

575
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:38,840
You understand the suffering? What kind of suffering, what type of suffering,

576
01:14:40,770 --> 01:14:43,430
 how it came to be that kind of suffering,

577
01:14:43,530 --> 01:14:53,130
 where is this leading, what kind of limitations are there?

578
01:14:53,230 --> 01:15:00,420
She wants to die but she wants to die very well dressed. That is Arsenicum.

579
01:15:00,520 --> 01:15:11,430
Immediately you have the perception. She wants to die but she has to be very...

580
01:15:11,530 --> 01:15:16,010
What is there? What is so important that she wants to dress the moment she wants to

581
01:15:16,110 --> 01:15:18,760
commit suicide tomorrow?

582
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:29,340
Then the pain and the exasperation and the exhaustion, she lies down and she says,

583
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:36,340
 I can't do it, that's not a life, let me finish with life.

584
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:44,860
That is synthesis, synthesing and perceiving finally as a symptomatology,

585
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:49,350
 you take here and there that kind of thing.

586
01:15:49,450 --> 01:15:58,850
That is now the construction, you have this model and you see it once, twice, three, four,

587
01:15:58,950 --> 01:16:06,100
five times and then you perceive this is the model, this is Nat mur.

588
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:11,930
I remember another case in London that was typical Staphysagria.

589
01:16:12,030 --> 01:16:17,510
It didn't cross my mind that it might have been Nat mur at all.

590
01:16:17,610 --> 01:16:29,350
So some students said we thought this is Nat mur, such grief and...

591
01:16:29,450 --> 01:16:36,350
I said yes but it didn't cross my mind, why it crossed the mind of somebody else?

592
01:16:36,450 --> 01:16:41,680
Because he takes the rubric ailments from grief and applies it there.

593
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:52,510
Ailments from grief Nat mur. Staphysagria is different in her mentality,

594
01:16:52,610 --> 01:16:56,760
the way that she reacts towards grief than Nat mur.

595
01:16:56,860 --> 01:17:04,090
This is Arsenicum, this is different. Now if I'm going because desire for salt.

596
01:17:04,190 --> 01:17:11,430
Forget desire for salt here. This is the idea, forget it here. This is not a Nat mur case.

597
01:17:11,530 --> 01:17:17,680
She was given Nat mur with no effect. It cannot have an effect Nat mur with this case.

598
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:21,930
What it has to do with Nat mur, it does not perform in this way.

599
01:17:22,030 --> 01:17:36,520
Nat mur can be very introverted and can be very stiff but it's another type all together.

600
01:17:41,110 --> 01:17:47,760
It's a very interesting case because we'll give Arsenicum and she will come back and

601
01:17:47,860 --> 01:17:56,510
 she will say nothing, I'm the same.

602
01:17:56,610 --> 01:18:03,510
That's why I brought the case. I didn't bring you the case to say that we have cured it.

603
01:18:03,610 --> 01:18:06,350
I brought you certain problems that you are going to face.

604
01:18:06,450 --> 01:18:11,630
Now after you have done all this analysis and after you sat down for one hour,

605
01:18:11,730 --> 01:18:17,550
 you analyzed and said this is a typical case of Arsenicum, take Arsenicum 10M and

606
01:18:17,650 --> 01:18:22,800
 then she comes back and she says I'm the same.

607
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:30,220
No changed? No changed. Still the pain? The pain is there, everything is there.

608
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:35,050
If you don't know the laws in this game, she almost misled me,

609
01:18:35,150 --> 01:18:38,300
 if you don't know the laws in this game,

610
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:44,670
 you will be completely mislead to believe that there was nothing there and

611
01:18:44,770 --> 01:18:56,470
 I will show you one point, of great interest. I will show you why.

612
01:18:56,980 --> 01:19:02,880
The follow up here is very interesting but first I want to give you the idea.

613
01:19:02,980 --> 01:19:05,370
I know you are tired, but she gives information and

614
01:19:05,470 --> 01:19:16,960
this information try to perceive it like a piece of art because for us we understand, we perceive,

615
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:20,050
this is Arsenicum.

616
01:19:20,150 --> 01:19:27,050
We recognize something special in a human being and then it becomes very important.

617
01:19:27,150 --> 01:19:33,720
Unless you see it this way then it's boring information, desires salt, don't desire salt...

618
01:19:33,820 --> 01:19:45,130
What is there? Just information that is thrown to you.

619
01:19:45,230 --> 01:19:48,380
-I don't get depressed usually of how things go.

620
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:57,710
-When you wake up in the morning do you feel refreshed or unrefreshed?

621
01:19:57,810 --> 01:20:02,060
-Usually somewhat refreshed.

622
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:15,710
-You said you are very superstitious,

623
01:20:15,810 --> 01:20:21,050
can you give us an example of what you mean by that?

624
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:26,050
-If I think that something bad happened to my father, I'm afraid that

625
01:20:26,150 --> 01:20:28,800
even just thinking about that I will make it happen,

626
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:33,390
I'm afraid to make certain thoughts and it can be one

627
01:20:33,490 --> 01:20:39,880
thing or another. If I think something good could happen...

628
01:20:39,980 --> 01:20:46,630
If I meet a man that I like, I'm afraid to tell my friends about it because

629
01:20:46,730 --> 01:20:54,640
I'm afraid to tell them will make it not happen, although it is irrational.

630
01:20:54,740 --> 01:21:00,710
If I'm talking about bad things, I'll make them happen, if I'm not talking about good things,

631
01:21:00,810 --> 01:21:07,130
I'll make them not happen, this is just a general fear of thinking or saying...

632
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:26,220
I guess I feel that I have to pray, I'm afraid that something could happen.

633
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:33,050
-Do you cry easily?

634
01:21:33,150 --> 01:21:47,430
-Not really easily. Sometimes I cry for sentimental things, a sentimental movie on TV.

635
01:21:47,530 --> 01:21:54,650
But I don't cry very easily just for sadness, feeling sorry for myself and start crying.

636
01:21:54,750 --> 01:22:11,650
What would you like more as a confirmation for Arsenicum? What you would like to have?

637
01:22:11,750 --> 01:22:16,740
Just find me a more precise keynote for Arsenicum where

638
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:20,490
Arsenicum is almost alone capital with a few other remedies...

639
01:22:20,590 --> 01:22:31,740
That is if you had this confirmation.

640
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:37,320
You would like to ask what?

641
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:48,150
-I thought about this anxiety in the morning.

642
01:22:48,250 --> 01:22:55,240
-I'll tell you another characteristic of Arsenicum is that

643
01:22:55,340 --> 01:23:03,990
they usually have an insecurity concerning financial matters.

644
01:23:04,090 --> 01:23:10,230
Arsenicum needs to know that has money in the bank but

645
01:23:10,330 --> 01:23:18,490
always the money in the bank must be more than what they need. That kind of attitude.

646
01:23:18,590 --> 01:23:26,320
Arsenicum is not a person who spends money, it is a person who collects money,

647
01:23:26,420 --> 01:23:33,360
who wants, who takes but it does not spend.

648
01:23:33,460 --> 01:23:48,090
How do you find this in the Repertory?
Avarice!

649
01:23:53,090 --> 01:24:01,570
You see Arsenicum is very strong because this trait of Arsenicum has been

650
01:24:01,670 --> 01:24:08,580
pointed out by all homeopaths. It is a very strong trait of Arsenicum.

651
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:27,320
Avarice is the same idea of not letting things out, keeping things, clinging to persons,

652
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:41,650
holding the persons, fearing to face the challenges of the world unprepared.

653
01:24:41,750 --> 01:24:52,660
They have to be very well prepared, very well done, meticulously.

654
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:56,150
Let's see a little bit more.

655
01:24:56,250 --> 01:25:01,410
-Is there any time that you feel worse or best?

656
01:25:01,510 --> 01:25:07,900
-I guess worse is when I first get up in the morning.

657
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,160
-And best?

658
01:25:10,260 --> 01:25:18,540
-Best in the afternoon...
