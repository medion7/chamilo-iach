1
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:32,960
-You can tell what happened. Last time you were here, it was two years ago.

2
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:38,390
-Two years ago, in 1998.

3
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:47,070
-And you had received initially Nat. mur. 200.

4
00:00:50,610 --> 00:01:03,760
-It was the third month of pregnancy and 5 months later, at the end of 8th month

5
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:13,590
of pregnancy I wrote you a letter and you prescribed Sepia 50M,

6
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:25,710
which I was afraid to take but I did took it and the reaction was beautiful.

7
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:38,350
I had very difficult pregnancy and the 9th month was very easy,

8
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:44,100
I had good feeling again towards the embryo and the children and my husband

9
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:52,730
and everything changed wonderfully and then the delivery was tremendously easy,

10
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,460
very easy, very quick.

11
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:06,530
I almost didn't feel anything and afterwards with the baby I had very good feelings

12
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:15,390
and I had a lot of milk and the baby was good and this kept for about a year.

13
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:34,560
Then I wrote you a letter, it was September 1999, there was no clear picture yet.

14
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,460
-I wrote back and I said it's no clear picture.

15
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:48,800
-Yes, I had few symptoms from the beginning, like depression again and irresolution

16
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:55,630
and all the things, forgetfulness, hurriedness but then the picture was not clear,

17
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:09,300
then in November 1999, Smedar and Tamar took my case in Israel and Tamar wrote you the letter

18
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:20,550
and you prescribed Phosphorus 200, which I didn't understand from my point of view

19
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:32,810
but it reduces the depression and I have a symptom which I didn't' t have before,

20
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:41,140
pain in the stomach, very sharp pain the whole night but then it's gone.

21
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:54,040
I tried to eat more and my baby started to be sick a lot, to have lungs problems

22
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:59,800
and I wonder whether it was connected to Phosphorus, I didn't know

23
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:07,800
but it was difficult time for me, for a few months.

24
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:14,320
Then I wrote you a fax again and you prescribed Sepia 10M.

25
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,990
I took the remedy in February this year.

26
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:38,630
This remedy acted for about a week or 10 days, I had much more sexual desire

27
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:52,150
and I had good feelings but then after really short time, I remember quarrelling with my husband,

28
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:58,080
a kind of disappointment from him and then I felt that it's all gone.

29
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:08,800
For about a month I was depressed and a symptom started to come again,

30
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:16,800
the allergy hay-fever which I suffered from it and it was gone with the Sepia during the pregnancy,

31
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:23,470
headaches, backaches, pain in my legs, everything that was completely disappeared,

32
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:27,050
started to come back.

33
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:32,260
I was asking myself what is happening, I was so confused

34
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:39,720
and then I think I did a very big mistake and I took another dose.

35
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,000
-You repeated the Sepia?

36
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:49,720
-I repeated the Sepia, I knew it was a mistake the same day

37
00:05:49,820 --> 00:06:07,390
but it was like I don't know why I did. I was so disappointed and in despair.

38
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:08,650
-What happened after Sepia?

39
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:17,910
-After Sepia the same day I got high fever and for about few days I had strong flu,

40
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:26,800
I couldn't get up from bed and then for a month I have every day another symptom.

41
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:32,300
All it was from the past. I knew the symptoms, nothing it was new

42
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:38,800
but it was coming day after day, symptom, symptom and I knew this was my mistake,

43
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:44,300
I have to wait and you also told me to wait and it's gone, after a month

44
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:55,400
I felt clean from this artificial thing on me.

45
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:09,630
I think that now about 3 months after it's a bit more clear.

46
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:14,780
I think what happened with the Nat. mur. is that the grief that I've told you

47
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:24,780
about from when I was 20 years, this is something that is now gone from life.

48
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,540
It's not influencing anymore.

49
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:37,120
I'm a person of grief like a sad person but these incidents are not living in here all the time,

50
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,860
I'm just free of it.

51
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:51,120
And I think the Sepia made a tremendous affection on me being a mother,

52
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:58,870
with the children, I think I had very good contact with my baby and with my other children

53
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:08,460
is not the way I wanted to be but it's not like I felt before.

54
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:16,780
I felt much more in communication  with them and good feelings.

55
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:25,480
Now I think it's a lower layer coming.

56
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:37,130
The main complain I think is emotional, I told you from the beginning

57
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:43,460
that I have a cyst in my right ovary.

58
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,540
-You checked it lately?
-I checked it and it's the same.

59
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,140
-The same size?
-Yes.

60
00:08:54,390 --> 00:09:02,050
Also I have pains in legs, so I have to change shoes every day

61
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:09,800
but I don't suffer from it so much and another thing that I was complaining about

62
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:22,750
which still I think I have to keep myself from it, is leucorrhea, the yeast infection

63
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:27,550
which I think I keep myself from it and I don't have it.

64
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,640
-You don't have it now?

65
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:46,150
-Yes but I think I have to keep sexual relationship normal but you know in Judaism

66
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,170
there are rules for sexual relationship.

67
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:58,050
We keep during the menses period and then one week after we don't...

68
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:06,560
And I feel that if I keep the rules, then it's OK because during this week I have the itching

69
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,150
and then it's gone.
-I see.

70
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:22,640
-I'm coming to now. The main thing is this irresolution that I can not decide anything.

71
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:30,480
I feel that it has influenced all over my life and my family and everybody is influenced

72
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:39,220
from this because I hesitate on everything, like when I go to bed if I have time

73
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,970
I want to take a book with me and then I take 3 books because...

74
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,810
-You cannot decide which one.

75
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:52,350
-And when I look at them it takes time and then I fall asleep because I don't have more time

76
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:57,550
to read and that happens all the time.

77
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:01,300
For example here in Alonissos, I'm here with my family

78
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:08,050
because I couldn't leave the children at home, it was a very big problem to separate

79
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:12,310
from the children and especially from the baby, so they all came with me

80
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:19,310
and we were looking for a house. We were on vacation and I couldn't relax,

81
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:24,120
just looking which house would be better and now we chose one

82
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:29,390
and to take the upper floor or the down?

83
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:32,630
All the time thinking and changing.

84
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:35,210
-You can not decide.

85
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:41,130
-Even when I decide something I still think whether it was the right decision or not.

86
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:48,380
-This happens also for big decisions, did you take any big decision?

87
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,970
-We are trying to buy a house in Israel and we don't do it,

88
00:11:53,070 --> 00:12:02,300
I think we both have problems in this but my problem is in making decision and I can not do it.

89
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:11,540
Or whether to come to Alonissos or not for me it's a big decision and it takes months on thinking

90
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:18,300
and until the very last moment all the time I worry about.

91
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:35,140
-So this is your main problem at this moment?
-I think in it there is everything connected to it.

92
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,300
-Can you give me what else is connected?

93
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:52,050
-Like I never have time, I'm trying to do many things and I don't have time

94
00:12:52,150 --> 00:13:03,540
for really doing something because I'm surrounded like trying to decide and organizing

95
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:08,300
but not in the thing and also with my children...

96
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,540
-Would you say you are in a hurry inside you?

97
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:19,520
-I'm very much in a hurry, I'm always in a hurry and all the time organizing things

98
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:32,150
and trying to chose, trying to think what is the right thing to do, what is better for me to do.

99
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:40,630
Like packing the bags to come to Alonissos I did it for a long time, to take this or this

100
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:53,380
and I'm exhausted but still I'm doing it and also since I don't decide from the beginning

101
00:13:53,480 --> 00:14:03,630
then I don't have time because until the very last moment I'm still working in my mind

102
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:14,870
and it makes me feel tense because I know that I won't be prepared, I'm going to be late,

103
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:28,480
not ready and if I do something then I regret, I think I made a mistake.

104
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:39,380
And also I feel that I don't enjoy life, it's also connected I think to the grief

105
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:53,790
and this attitude of sadness but more now it's this that I don't experience what happens

106
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:59,900
and I'm far out thinking what to do and what is right.

107
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:08,530
Sometimes I think I don't really listen to my child because I'm in the next thing

108
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:12,520
or in the prior but not in the present.

109
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,780
-Your mind is racing all the time.

110
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:24,040
-Yes and also this is another thing which is coming now from the past.

111
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:32,490
I have a very low feeling about myself comparing to others.

112
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:37,760
I feel like I don't have anything inside like I don't have anything in my life.

113
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:42,740
I'm 40 years old and like I don't know anything and how come?

114
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:51,590
I have my life, I have my children but my feeling is that nothing exists,

115
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:55,680
all these years I didn't learn anything.

116
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,670
-Have you been in the army?

117
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:04,090
-Yes, I was in the army and I was in computer.

118
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:18,580
-What is your skills? You have computer skills, in high school you did mathematics?

119
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:23,220
You were medium, how you were in school?
-Mathematics yes, very high.

120
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,340
-And still you were not believing into yourself?

121
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:36,610
-Not then but I was very high and I think there were a lot of expectations

122
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:44,430
from my parents, from myself and now I feel that I didn't accomplish anything.

123
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:51,760
-But do you now feel that you don't have any skills, you don't know what to do?

124
00:16:51,860 --> 00:17:00,760
-It's not that I don't have skills but when it comes to the point, then I feel that I don't know.

125
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:07,010
-This is what I say. You don't know what to do with the child...

126
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:16,000
-But also whether to chose a remedy, when it comes to the point it's like I don't know anything,

127
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:28,910
like I didn't study anything and I feel that I have this year very big conflict

128
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:38,910
in myself because I had again expectation to make a big progress in Homeopathy

129
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:45,010
but I had the baby and it was difficult to separate from her and also in my mind

130
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:49,110
I thought it's better to be with her.

131
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:56,000
But then I didn't do neither of them because I also tried to do this and this

132
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,240
but I didn't make this progress.

133
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,010
-But you didn't feel that you lack in self-confidence?

134
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,480
-Yes.

135
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,490
-Very much?

136
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:20,860
-I don't know, I think it's a change now because first I did have this irresolution before.

137
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:28,500
My husband knows what he wants, so I wanted to do what he wants and to give up myself

138
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:34,260
and I was frustrated and angry and this was, I think, Sepia.

139
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:41,260
And now I don't know so it's better to take his way.

140
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:47,260
-But do you need also his protection? You feel that you need to be protected by him?

141
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:57,250
-I feel that I want reassurance from him because if he criticizes me, then I'm lost

142
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:03,810
because I can not stand on my own because I don't know what I want.

143
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:08,530
I don't know what I'm doing.

144
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:14,400
-How is your memory?
-Not good.

145
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:19,760
-But not very bad either?
-I think it's getting worse.

146
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:31,990
When I came here I thought it was connected to the grief because this time

147
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:36,740
I don't remember a period of time but also I don't remember my childhood

148
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:42,980
but now I feel that I don't remember my past at all and also little things

149
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:49,000
like where I put something or what I said or what I wanted to do.

150
00:19:50,590 --> 00:20:04,750
-Tell me something else. Do you have this where you wanted to go

151
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:07,990
and find something in the next room and then you go to the next room

152
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:11,340
and you forgot why you were there?

153
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:20,570
-Rarely but it happens and then I'm thinking and I don't remember

154
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:24,330
and then I'm in another thing and then I remember.

155
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:33,710
-You talked about that grief, there was a big grief that you had

156
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:39,190
and you said now it's over it's not anymore in your head?

157
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:46,630
But this grief I believe was concerning emotional relationship, right?

158
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:47,380
-Yes.

159
00:20:47,480 --> 00:21:00,700
-Now you are not disappointed that you did not continue with that?

160
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:08,800
-This grief was about a boyfriend of mine from the age of 20 and he died from cancer.

161
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:21,190
-And now with the husband that you have sexually you feel good, connected?

162
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:30,460
-It's much better now, I have my desire but it's not for every day, it's not frequent.

163
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:35,450
-With the other boy that he died you had much more desire?

164
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:40,940
-No, it was before I had children and also with my husband before we had children...

165
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,700
-So you were careful?

166
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:50,450
-No, it was the beginning, falling in love, much more sexual and now

167
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:58,630
I'm not looking for it, my husband wants it much more and now when we have it, I enjoy it.

168
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,390
I don't need it so much.

169
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:08,030
-Your parents are both alive?
-Yes.

170
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:09,530
-Is anybody suffering?

171
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:15,640
-My mother suffers from high blood pressure and palpitation.

172
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:22,190
My father has skin problems but I always tell him this is good.

173
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:30,430
-There is cancer in your family at all? Brothers, sisters, uncles?

174
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:50,930
-No. I want to tell about my parents that during this year and maybe the last years

175
00:22:51,030 --> 00:23:12,880
it became much stronger, I feel that I want them to support me studing Homeopathy

176
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:18,880
and make a progress, I feel I want them to support me for doing what I didn't do

177
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:24,510
when I was 20 with this problem, I didn't accomplish things.

178
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:33,440
-Have you ever been wild child?
-No, I was always very good girl.

179
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:37,430
-You never took hashish, marihuana?

180
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:43,030
-I tried few times but I didn't like it.

181
00:23:49,290 --> 00:24:02,860
-Are you sure? Difficult question. I have not yet found a young person

182
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:13,600
who has not taken these drugs. Who did not try. But my question is how much?

183
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:24,600
-Very little. I think I can count 5-10 times, no more.

184
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:32,840
-Did you ever have a bad reaction from that? You remember any bad experience?

185
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:41,610
-I remember that I didn't like it, I didn't like being dizzy and being out.

186
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:50,860
I liked to be in control and when I felt it's not control, I didn't like it at all.

187
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:55,180
My friends did like it but I don't.

188
00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:03,280
-Did you ever have any skin eruption yourself in the past, as a child?

189
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,570
-I don't remember.

190
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:31,030
-You have in your report here, you have said that you did not like the smell of fish.

191
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:37,780
-During the pregnancy. I can eat fish, still I don't like the smell so much.

192
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:43,520
-But you can eat fish, you like fish? You cannot say.

193
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:53,110
What about sweets?
-I like sweets now  more than before.

194
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:56,110
-Salt?
-Still.

195
00:25:56,210 --> 00:26:02,610
-You like salt, more than usual or medium?

196
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:14,700
-It's medium but if it's no salt I don't like the food. Maybe less than before.

197
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:24,100
-You have any hair fall?
-Yes.

198
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,680
-Strongly?

199
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:32,180
-It's always after giving birth for about a year.

200
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:38,000
-How many children you have?
-Three.

201
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,870
-With the same husband?
-Yes.

202
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:52,750
And I had one abortion before I had the kids, with the same husband

203
00:26:52,850 --> 00:27:01,500
and I told you in the fax that this was another grief of my life.

204
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,500
-You did not want?

205
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:11,330
-It was like an instinct that I didn't want to do it but all the circumstances

206
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:17,580
was like doing it and my husband was not my husband then

207
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:28,840
and it was just after the death of my prior friend and I really didn't feel good about it

208
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:37,430
and I still I regret about it and like I have this child in my mind sometimes.

209
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:55,340
I wanted to tell you about my parents that I want them to support me and during this year

210
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:02,590
I tried a few times to tell them that I need their support emotionally and money wise

211
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:08,840
but I didn't dare to talk to them about it and it's so strange for me, why I don't say it.

212
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:17,330
I need your support but they don't really like Homeopathy, they are in the other side

213
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:25,340
and also maybe they don't want to give money for this, I don't know.

214
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:32,590
I have to speak about it and to open myself but I don't, I remain close

215
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:37,580
and this influence my relationship with them because ...

216
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,840
-You are in distance.

217
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:44,590
-Yes and a few times I was sitting in front of my father and I said,

218
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:48,680
now I speak but I can not.

219
00:28:50,170 --> 00:29:01,070
It's a kind of fear and also I have this fear that something bad will happen to the children

220
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:07,940
or to us or to me and all concerning the children.

221
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:16,570
Sometimes I see visions, like I go with the car and it falls

222
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:22,530
or my husband is now with the children at the beach and that something will happen.

223
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:28,430
And then I clear my mind but it comes.

224
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:39,990
-Do you feel very much the heat or the cold?
-I think it's even.

225
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:45,240
-Your nails are strong?
-It's OK.

226
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:49,920
-How much thirst?

227
00:29:52,590 --> 00:30:05,990
-It was very high while I was nursing but now I think it's normal and I drink much warm drinks.

228
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:10,850
-What about fruits?
-I like fruits.

229
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:22,240
There was time in my life that I really loved fruits.

230
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:27,100
Now it's not that I'm looking for it but I eat fruits.

231
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:39,170
And there is another thing in the morning, this is continuing,

232
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:47,740
when I just wake up and open my eyes I have gloomy feeling.

233
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:55,220
I remember times that it was a depression. Now it's not a depression but I'm not happy.

234
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:04,740
I'm looking towards the day and thinking what I have to do and then I'm tensed.

235
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:13,340
-You feel the responsibility is too much for you or what? You can not handle it.

236
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:22,650
-I have to wake up the children to go to school and they want to go on sleeping

237
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:29,480
and I don't want to wake them, why to do this to them and I'm sad about it

238
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:35,660
and I don't feel that I can make them happy because I'm not happy myself.

239
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:44,590
I don't feel easy, it's heavy.

240
00:31:53,590 --> 00:32:06,340
-Anything else? OK.

241
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:32,410
Since you don't know the follow up that came through the fax,

242
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:51,560
I have to read you the follow up to see why I prescribed Sepia. She says, I got Nat. mur.

243
00:32:53,160 --> 00:33:01,500
and I'm not sure that the picture at this moment is clear now but I don't feel good.

244
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:09,730
I'm depressed and I think that the remedy is not working anymore. I feel completely powerless,

245
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:13,720
physically and emotionally and mentally.

246
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:22,730
I have ne joy, no happiness, no smile and I'm not nice to the people around me.

247
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:28,160
You see how she describes the case of Sepia, it's unbelievable

248
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:32,740
because you were surprised why I prescribed 50M.

249
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:41,320
I don't feel myself, I'm tensed, I feel and think negative

250
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:44,590
and I try to think positive but no success.

251
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:48,900
My thoughts and dreams are bothersome and full of worries.

252
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,170
I don't have any positive feelings towards the embryo.

253
00:33:57,250 --> 00:34:08,250
I'm worried that there might be something wrong with it, I don't feel connected to it at all.

254
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,900
You see how she describes the Sepia state exactly.

255
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:20,260
The same way I don't feel connected to my other children and husband.

256
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,390
I don't feel the love and happiness, only the duties.

257
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:29,740
I pity them for having me as a mother and wife.

258
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:35,230
Also I feel bitter and angry with others.

259
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:42,330
I feel that things are happening against my will and that I blame others for that.

260
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:50,980
It's terribly difficult for me to make decisions, I'm afraid to make the wrong choice

261
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:58,390
and even when the time is over, I still don't make up my mind and if I'm ignoring reality,

262
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:01,970
then I feel disconnected and bitter.

263
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:10,320
Physically I feel very heavy and limited. Every physical exertion is difficult,

264
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:19,720
climbing stairs is a big effort, I can't stand, I have to sit. Mainly I can't lift things.

265
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:27,150
My back cant' stand it. The middle back is weak and painful and can't hold the effort.

266
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:43,560
Also pains in the bones around vagina. My lower back feels as if broken, I have varicose veins,

267
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:49,480
swollen legs, I have to wear elastic socks.

268
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:56,500
Also I have to wear something tight to hold the belly, otherwise it feels uncomfortable.

269
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:07,720
You see all the symptoms...

270
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:11,950
Still the urine doesn't come out in strong stream.

271
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:19,990
Afterwards there is some more urine coming out involuntarily. I have to wear pad all the time.

272
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:28,370
The yeast infection in the vagina is better but I have no sexual desire and no attraction,

273
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:33,890
what makes the distance with my husband even bigger.

274
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:42,550
I feel generally warm, when someone touches me, it hits me, so I don't' want to be touched.

275
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:46,550
I'm less thirsty and there is less desire to eat.

276
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:52,040
No special desires. I have aversion to fish smell and to chicken.

277
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:59,290
When I lie down on the back lifting my legs, I feel pressure on the chest.

278
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:14,870
And then she makes a post script here.

279
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:19,420
You remember she has taken initially Nat. mur.

280
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:35,140
She says, a month ago I had to take an antideimmunisation, I don't know what it is.

281
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:45,390
What is this?
-It's for rhesus.

282
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:53,650
-Yes that's true... since my blood type is rhesus negative. Could it antidote the remedy?

283
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:03,710
It's very interesting because it's very instructive case. Then I said, take Sepia 50M

284
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:13,140
because we have a perfect picture of Sepia. It could not be more perfect, she has everything.

285
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:30,810
What antideimmunisation did, it brought out, most probably, the next layer.

286
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:42,620
That is very interesting. Here we have a case of grief, uppermost.

287
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:56,810
With an underline layer which comes up a little bit, which is Nat. mur. and then Sepia

288
00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:03,630
and then we have underline this.

289
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:19,290
So there is a symptom which comes from a deeper layer, which is the irresolution as you hear.

290
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:24,050
She describes here everything else went away except of that symptom.

291
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:36,460
That means that symptom, which is irresolution, that was popping out belonged

292
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:41,300
to an underline layer.

293
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:57,600
And that is why also when she repeated untimely Sepia, she had a very bad time,

294
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:02,270
after repeated Sepia wrongly.

295
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:07,400
She bothered me quite a lot, she sent faxes, what shall I do, I made a mistake, I'm stupid,

296
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:13,780
I feel very bad and blah, blah, blah. I said wait. No give me a remedy.

297
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:19,130
No I don't give you a remedy unless you come here. When you come, then we discuss.

298
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:29,790
So this is what I was trying to persuade you not to do. Just before.

299
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:38,190
I didn't know the case was coming, just now. She is a very good example of what I said before.

300
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:41,780
It is like synchronicity.

301
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:52,460
A perfect case of Sepia, she did so well and she repeated it untimely and she goes down like this.

302
00:40:55,470 --> 00:41:09,230
So now what do we have to do is to find this underline layer which is there very much.

303
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:14,360
We have the symptoms.  Give me the symptoms.

304
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:35,850
Cyst in the ovary, the three first are one symptom and then the three seconds

305
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:47,090
are another one symptom, weakness of memory, desires, anxiety for others,

306
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:56,200
waking in the morning sadness, in a hurry and the remedy ...

307
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,650
-Baryta carbonica.

308
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:27,080
-The remedy is Baryta carbonica. I tried to differentiate between Graphites

309
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:33,710
because the aversion fish was not exactly aversion fish and she confirmed Bar. carb.

310
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:42,950
by talking about her memory and also talking about fruits. Baryta carb. does not like fruits.

311
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:52,200
Finally when she says yes I like fruits, she says I don't like them as much as before.

312
00:42:52,300 --> 00:43:01,310
You see this becomes important because of less desire for fruits.

313
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:13,210
So that is the third remedy for her so she can speak to her parents and tell them

314
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,810
what they have to hear.

315
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:36,320
What potency? Who says 30? Who says 200? Who says 1M? 10M? 50M? CM?

316
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:49,310
OK, CM. No, 1M is enough.

317
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:55,360
-There is a question George. She said she had her fall but the peculiarity was aggravated

318
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:59,870
after pregnancy and in this rubric...

319
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:06,120
So if you put it together with the low self-esteem desire sweets, right sided, desire warm drinks

320
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:11,220
and together with the fact that Lycopodium is complementary to Sepia?

321
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:24,620
-You deviated from the right line of thinking. Here you can not ignore...

322
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:38,540
Always you go to the strange, rare and peculiar and take this and base your prescription on that

323
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:47,790
and what is really at the moment bothering the person and what bothers her at  the moment

324
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:50,700
is lack of decision.

325
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:56,860
Irresolution, you have to find a remedy that really is irresolution.

326
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:04,120
Irresolution, we have 72 remedies. Which one?

327
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:12,880
That remedy which has at the same time lack of self-confidence, that she needs protection,

328
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:17,370
that she can not speak to her parents.

329
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:26,590
I have these needs. That forms together with the memory and together with the lack

330
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:34,470
of desire for fruits, as it was before, makes a case of Baryta carbonica.

331
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:45,870
When the indecision is so strong, you have to find a remedy that has very strong indecision

332
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:55,620
and we know that the remedy which has strong indecision in everything big or small things

333
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,130
is Baryta carbonica.

334
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:12,730
Not only that but Pulsatilla will not describe the need for protection like this.

335
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:23,790
I feel I don't have, my mind is empty, I don't have anything to say,

336
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:30,400
so I better leave it to my husband I better leave it to somebody else who makes the decision.

337
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:39,080
So this description fits the Baryta carbonica description, not Pulsatilla.
