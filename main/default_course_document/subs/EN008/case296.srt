1
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:26,660
-OK we can start with her story.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,410
-I started homeopathic treatment in January and the reasons are that I have a

3
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,770
depression and the other is that I suffer from psoriasis.

4
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:57,390
-The remedy she has taken so far is Kali-c.?
-Yes.

5
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:03,890
-And the reason she went in the homeopath in January was because of depression or

6
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,570
now the depression has arised?

7
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,920
-No, the depression started already about 3/4 of the year before I went to the homeopath.

8
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:27,040
-That's what I say. She went to the homeopath to be treated for the depression,

9
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,390
not for something else.

10
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:50,470
-I developed some symptoms here, in the last few days. One of them is that I feel

11
00:01:50,570 --> 00:02:05,490
a pressure on my heart and I know it's not the organ itself. I can't take a deep breath

12
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:10,720
I can't breathe down into my abdomen as if there is a blockage.

13
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,330
-As if there is a blockage in her breathing?

14
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:26,080
-Yes. I have the feeling I only can just barely breathe superficially.

15
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:52,720
If I'm down at the beach and really relaxing, I feel that it softens and that I can breathe

16
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:59,730
deeper but for instance now again is like that and the pressure on my heart is permanent

17
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,330
these past days, there is no change in it.

18
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,070
-And the pressure in the heart is recent? It's only here?

19
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,330
-I know it, I used to have it once in a while, for a few days but it always went away and

20
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,660
now since few days here, it's staying.

21
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:54,160
Since I heard yesterday that I'm going to be a live case here today, I'm quite nauseous.

22
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:09,880
And I know that from many years in my childhood, strong feeling of nauseousness

23
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,480
without vomiting.

24
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:25,240
That was what I wanted to say in the beginning and now I would like to tell you

25
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,790
some parts of my life.

26
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:33,320
When my mother was pregnant with me, she tried to abort the pregnancy by letting an

27
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:38,770
ultra sound device put into the uterus but luckily enough that thing fell out and

28
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,920
I was born a couple of months later.

29
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:51,070
My memory I had very happy childhood because I was always speaking with the animals

30
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:56,250
and the flowers and the wind and sometimes even with things which were not visible.

31
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:11,490
But I always had a strong longing that my mother should love me which never did.

32
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,120
I never felt that she loved me.

33
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,480
And for two years, I remember in my childhood, that I woke up every night screaming

34
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:24,660
because I had anxiety dreams and I couldn't get up. My mother had to come and fetch me

35
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,910
and take me into their bed and then they continued sleeping and I was lying there

36
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:34,820
in the middle and still couldn't sleep because I actually still had anxiety.

37
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:45,310
-How old she was by that time?
-Between 4-6 years.

38
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,550
My sister and I, she is 6 years old, we didn't have that good relationship,

39
00:05:52,650 --> 00:06:00,000
our father was very strict and sometimes also beat us, but what was much more prominent,

40
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:08,800
he had a kind of aura, which always made the day not happy anymore when he was coming home.

41
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,480
I always felt that something threatening was coming from him.

42
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:23,400
-Her father was an army man?
-No.

43
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:35,840
From many years I remember wishing for their love and their recognition which I never got.

44
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:49,050
Probably I was too lively for them, I had too much vivid imagination and phantasy and they

45
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:55,630
somehow couldn't deal with it. So this longing just remained but on the other hand

46
00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:00,000
I did have the flowers and the trees and the animals and everything outside.

47
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:07,630
I met my husband when I was 17,5 and he also was the first man I ever kissed.

48
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:12,690
Before, I had no experience whatsoever, I haven't even flirt or anything before.

49
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:19,390
And this marriage separated 2,5 years ago. I was the one who walked out of the

50
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:24,230
relationship, even though this man was a person who loved me very much.

51
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:36,950
But the last years of our relationship were such that we both developed into different

52
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:41,250
directions and it just was not possible to work it out anymore.

53
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:54,940
We have one child together, a boy, he is turning 20 now and it was so that before I met

54
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:01,440
my husband I already saw him and I also saw my son before he was born.

55
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,290
Meaning I had pictures of them already before they were there.

56
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:21,550
I was born in the eastern part of Berlin and we built a house there during our marriage.

57
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:31,540
-She was eastern Berliner?
-Not anymore.

58
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:38,540
-But she was living in east Berlin?
-Yes.

59
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:45,200
We built a house at that time and I had years of working very hard, I was working 3 jobs

60
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:51,690
at the same time and also building up the house. At that time I had a lot of energy

61
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:57,730
and liked physical work, physical exertion and I just loved watching what comes out from

62
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,330
the work of your hands, what you can create.

63
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:06,370
-But it was allowed to have their own house in east Berlin?

64
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,720
-It was allowed.

65
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:22,560
I forgot one thing. The psoriasis developed when I had sexual intercourse with my

66
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,630
husband for the very first time.

67
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:36,980
-It was unpleasant for her? Pleasant?
-Yes, I wanted it.

68
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:45,860
-But she had a shock? She said she developed psoriasis after the first intercourse.

69
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:59,260
She had a pleasant shock? It was a big experience for her, something which changed

70
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,950
her inner world?

71
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:08,550
-Not in anyway you put it, the only thing I could think is that maybe I was afraid of my

72
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:13,600
father because I was doing something he would not approve but if there is an

73
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,200
explanation it could be that, otherwise I don't know.

74
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:25,460
-And she became pregnant after this intercourse?

75
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:39,680
-No. I have the psoriasis across my entire abdomen and also my legs, my arms and

76
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,690
later on also my head.

77
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:45,530
-She developed that immediately after the intercourse?

78
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,290
-4 days later.

79
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:05,810
-The feelings she had were feelings of happiness inside or feelings of fear?

80
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:13,910
-No, mostly feelings of happiness, maybe feeling of fear not to lose this person but

81
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,260
mostly I was happy.

82
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:22,470
-How is that she does not have psoriasis now?

83
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:34,200
-For many years I treated psoriasis with tar preparations and I also have psoriasis now only

84
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:38,440
not as strong as it used to. And before, in times when it was really bad,

85
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,050
I also used cortisone.

86
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:52,280
I was very thankful and very happy at that time that this man did not leave me in spite

87
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:58,780
the fact that I didn't feel very beautiful anymore, I felt more ugly and that he took me as

88
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,460
I was and I was very thankful for it.

89
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:19,910
-What was her husband?
-Electrician.

90
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:27,290
During the time when we were building the house, I was working a lot physically and

91
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:32,540
I was very exhausted in the evenings because I was doing a lot, I only weight 50 kilos

92
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:38,780
myself but I was able to carry cement bags weighing 50 kilos themselves and I

93
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:48,370
remember always being very proud about my physical strength and also my persistence.

94
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:51,420
Whatever I planned, I could carry through.

95
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:59,040
Suddenly enough, exactly at this time, when I was physically working so hard,

96
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:06,040
so exhausting very often, my husband betrayed me and I felt it and I asked him and

97
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,220
he admitted it was the truth.

98
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:21,450
And after that I developed another strong push of the psoriasis and as I did also in my

99
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:25,700
childhood, I didn't talk to anybody about that.

100
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,950
In my childhood I also had many years when I didn't talk, I was used into keeping things

101
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:35,210
inside, I wrote a lot into my diary but I didn't talk to anybody.

102
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:40,530
I remember those were the years where I had to fight with this constant nauseousness

103
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,390
in the years I didn't talk.

104
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:51,290
Next to my husband I always felt like the little girl, even though my friends were saying

105
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:55,040
you are not, you are the power woman, you are doing everything, you are managing

106
00:13:55,140 --> 00:14:01,140
everything and it was the truth, I was doing all these things but I never felt like it.

107
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,210
I always felt like a little girl.

108
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:20,870
When the house was almost finished, I talked to my husband very much, very long and

109
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:26,200
told him that I felt I could not live any longer in this state, in this system, it was a

110
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:31,200
suppressing system and already in school I never joined any of the usual organizations

111
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,450
where most of people went already in school.

112
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,530
I was a kind of an outsider concerning this

113
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:42,110
and I told him even in the most beautiful house, in a golden cage a nightingale would not

114
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:45,460
sing and so I felt I could not live there any longer.

115
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:52,620
We talked about this issue for more than a year and my husband was not very happy

116
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,620
about it but through the years before this entire process of building the house and

117
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:04,120
realizing whatever I plan or try, I can manage and I can go through with it, I felt the

118
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:09,150
strength and I had this experience in my background now and I knew, if I really wanted

119
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,200
something, it could happen.

120
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,950
And so I also had this feeling there is a way out of this system.

121
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:22,300
-What she meant, she was planning to defect, to go out to the West?

122
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:28,450
-Yes, I planned to leave the country but officially. At that time you could apply for

123
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:35,410
leaving the country and we did that, very officially and I was also the one who quickly

124
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:40,900
connected with other people who also wanted to leave and I was active in this movement

125
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:55,550
and carried a lot of these services, Sunday services in church.

126
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:00,450
-She got a job on Sunday services?

127
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:04,300
-No, this peace movement, the activists in Eastern Germany.

128
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:15,700
-After the fall of the system?
-No, before.

129
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,880
-Before it was not allowed to go out.

130
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,650
-You could, you could apply before, it depended whether they would allow you or not

131
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:30,650
you could fill the application. You could apply, of course you had to wait 6,7 even

132
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:37,420
10 years until you got permission but you could apply. It was like dancing on a wire

133
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:44,660
you could go this way or that way. If you were too official and getting too uncomfortable

134
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:50,870
for them, you would end up in jail or if you carried through with it and you were very

135
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:55,310
active and very known publically, they couldn't do that.

136
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:59,160
So you got more and more uncomfortable until finally they wanted to get rid of you.

137
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:09,070
I had a lot of encounters with the Stasi and the service system there and I was afraid

138
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:14,160
and shaking and trembling very often but I just felt I had to carry through and I would

139
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:18,200
carry through and that's why I got so connected with all these organizations and

140
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,640
developed a lot of energy in this matter.

141
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,530
Then we got a 24 hour notice that we were permitted to leave the country, meaning we

142
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:33,280
had to give our house to the State, even though we had given it to our parents but they

143
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:40,280
wouldn't accept it, so we had to write it over to the State and then we just had time to

144
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:45,380
take one suitcase and one bag and leave, that was the usual way at that time.

145
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:53,380
-And with her husband they left.
-Yes and child.

146
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:13,180
When we were in west Berlin I worked as a nurse, which is my profession and I also

147
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:20,700
worked almost round the clock and after 2 years I started my education as a practitioner.

148
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:36,850
These two things I also did parallel at the same time and I also attended many seminars

149
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,450
and all together I was very active again.

150
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:57,180
Then the time came when the Wall came down and my husband couldn't deal with the

151
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,030
fact that he had lost the house.

152
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:09,180
So at that time I was busy with all the new things I was doing and the courses and very

153
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:16,180
happy with it and that I had content in my life and I was going on with it but he couldn't.

154
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:22,910
He was very sad because he had lost the house and he couldn't get out of that and that

155
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:27,250
was the time when we started developing in separate ways.

156
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,700
-He wanted to go back at the house?

157
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:41,410
-It wasn't possible at all but it was probably the fact that he developed a depression at

158
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:47,170
that time and I couldn't go back to that point and stick with it and so that's where we

159
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,490
started going apart.

160
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:55,740
-So her husband went back to east Germany?
-No.

161
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:02,080
It was most that I had started to practice physical therapies and many things in

162
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:15,910
a very energetic level and I had been training my awareness and perception and I felt

163
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:21,490
he was getting heavier and heavier in his energy and lower and lower and I couldn't

164
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:31,680
take that anymore with the sensitivity I had. I couldn't go on living and working like that.

165
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:42,930
Then I told him that I did not want to continue the relationship.

166
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:56,610
And he then moved and went to live in Bavaria.

167
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:08,250
I have to say that I always felt this relationship for him giving me a lot of security, he was

168
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:12,830
like my piece of ground, my piece of earth even though I was the one who was

169
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:16,780
developing activity and working and powering and so on.

170
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:24,270
He was something that maybe centered me, kept me on the ground and although I was the one

171
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:29,920
who wanted the separation, I knew it was going to be a big step to an unknown world.

172
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,580
-She developed in the meantime an affair?

173
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:42,010
-Quite quickly after the separation I had a relationship with another man for 1,5 year.

174
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:57,760
That was a man who, himself also was in a spiritual search, spiritual path.

175
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:03,360
And since I already had a child, I always asked a lot of questions about what's going on

176
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:08,570
and read many books and was very interested in looking myself. I was very happy to

177
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,680
have met such a person.

178
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:19,410
This man together with other people and a group, which was in a process of a therapy

179
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:27,660
took drugs to be able to perceive certain things more clearly and ...

180
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,160
-For spiritual search?

181
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:37,510
-Yes and go back to some things and release them.

182
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:43,750
-She took also?
-Yes.

183
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:54,100
-What kind?
-It's called MDMA.

184
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:58,260
-Chemical?

185
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:04,910
-For example one of my issues I was working on was find out why I constantly have

186
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:07,110
the feeling my parents don't love me.

187
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:34,240
And for me was very important because I had the possibility or I was allowed to look at

188
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:39,740
feelings I used to have as a child, from a different perspective and I also this way I was

189
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,480
able to understand how the life of my mother had been before, I was there and which

190
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:49,090
feelings my father had at that time and so on.

191
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:04,230
And later on I asked my parents about it and said, was that the case, did you feel this

192
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:09,830
and this way and was the situation so and so and both said, yes that what it was.

193
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,650
I always felt that for my mother I was too much, I was in the way, I was not wanted and

194
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:45,440
actually she had wanted to separate from my father, which then was not possible

195
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,790
anymore because I was under way.

196
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:04,140
My father was very happy when I was under way because he hoped that, that would save

197
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:10,700
the marriage and they are still together today but at that point the marriage was very critical.

198
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:18,600
And I, as a child, always felt their frustration, his and hers, it was always poured out

199
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:24,100
on my back, even though actually I couldn't tell it but both of them had frustration that

200
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,850
had to go out and they kept going on to me.

201
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:34,100
All of this situation I could re-live or feel again under the influence of this drug and later

202
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,450
I asked them about it and found out how it was.

203
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:46,900
-Is she clairvoyant in other things like foreseen things that happen?

204
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:53,850
-That's more the way that I've trained to do that. I've trained this ability, I will tell you

205
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:57,450
more about it, what I worked.

206
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:07,840
The experience with this drug was very valuable for me because I could understand

207
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:14,280
what was happening with my parents but also after that I never got rid of this feeling

208
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:17,120
of being unwanted, not loved.

209
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:23,270
And I realized especially since I felt into this depression that I can't get this contact to

210
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:40,450
myself, nothing is in flow, everything is blocked and I always feel as if a part of me was

211
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:47,670
not there, I'm always in effort. I always have to try to be good enough, to satisfy

212
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:53,350
everybody and it's a constant strain I'm under, to satisfy.

213
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:07,000
This feeling I have almost my entire life, I have to be something, I must be something

214
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:13,010
else, something better, I just can't be the way I am, I can't be myself.

215
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:28,930
My mother always used to say, you are tough, you can take anything and so when I

216
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:35,910
fell I hardly ever cried, she always said, you manage and so I always try to be the strong

217
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:42,280
one and the tough one and in my entire life I'm strong but I was never permitted to also

218
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,840
show the weak side in me.

219
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:55,250
There were many things that hurt me and when I cried or said I didn't like it, they said

220
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:59,580
come on don't be so sensitive and don't take everything in the bad part.

221
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:06,110
It was like they never took me seriously and so today when I'm together with other people

222
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:12,050
and I feel that something hurt my feelings, it's very difficult for me to articulate it at all.

223
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:23,950
What I also forgot to mention is that while my mother was pregnant with me, my father

224
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:29,600
was in the hospital for lung patients with tuberculosis.

225
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,320
And I tell you a little bit about the kind of work I do.

226
00:28:49,830 --> 00:29:07,720
I'm doing a craniosacral body therapy and then with a couple of Indian people I learned

227
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:14,310
another kind of therapy which is called inner reading, meaning to go inside yourself and

228
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:15,910
read yourself.

229
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:25,900
Over the years I developed quite some sensitivity, while I treat the patients I feel pictures

230
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,840
arising in me, I can see things about their life or about their childhood and I also

231
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:36,410
developed the ability to feel organs of the body.

232
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:49,310
I sit on the foot of the bed and I imagine the body and I get a certain feeling and my

233
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:55,560
thinking is that you should have this and this check. I don't want to scare them, I just

234
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,660
give them hints of what they could do.

235
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:10,900
I can't do it immediately like if you push a button, I need some minutes to enter this

236
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:20,240
and there is also days where I see nothing. That's also possible.

237
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:33,160
-I have not understood yet. The depression has started about a year ago?

238
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,410
What she calls depression?

239
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:42,390
-I had this drug experience together with this man and right after that, he told me I don't

240
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:48,990
love you and left. And that was the one relationship I had after my marriage.

241
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:57,320
-And then started the depression or after a few months?

242
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:05,780
-It was pretty much right after he walked out of me but what came into the picture too

243
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:13,050
was that, that was actually the point where I started feeling what was going on.

244
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:19,290
All these feelings about my marriage started coming up and the realization that I was

245
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:22,280
alone and that I had nobody around me anymore.

246
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:29,280
The whole feelings of the whole story came up then and all that together.

247
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:38,220
-And that feeling of being rejected by her parents also became more strong?

248
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:46,870
-And a feeling of loss also. That she had a loss, even though she was the one who

249
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:49,470
walked out from marriage.

250
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:57,200
The feeling concerning my parents I had during this drug therapy. After that I personally

251
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:03,960
decided for myself that I love my parents and that I will go and visit them, no matter how

252
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:09,050
they behaved towards me, I will go to them, take them in the arms and show them my love.

253
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:16,730
And after that the relationship really improved which had been difficult until my 38th

254
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:19,340
year but after that it improved.

255
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:26,310
-Does she grind her teeth during sleep?

256
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:34,450
-I used to do it for a while but that was a time where I had many amalgam fillings

257
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:42,730
which actually were too high and by grinding at night, I would lower them and when they

258
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:45,060
fit, I stopped it again.

259
00:32:52,570 --> 00:33:06,950
-How much salt she takes?
-Hardly any, less than normal.

260
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:13,550
-If it is a little bit than normal, she will leave the food, she will not eat it?

261
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:27,640
-I don't like it. I like to eat olives, they are supposed to be quite salty but

262
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,240
that's practically the only thing.

263
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:37,490
-Fruits she takes?
-Yes, I like very much.

264
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:43,080
-All kinds of fruits or sour or sweet fruits?

265
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:56,820
-All, I used to prefer more the sour and now I prefer more the ripe and sweet fruits.

266
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:09,470
-How much water she drinks?
-At least 1,5-2 lit.

267
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:17,310
-So she is thirsty. For cold water?

268
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:29,800
-No. Here I do drink water but at home I drink tea and I drink eat lukewarm.

269
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:44,390
-She prefers warm or cold drinks in general?
-Warm, not hot but warm.

270
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:59,720
-Her menses are normal?
-Yes but scanty.

271
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:07,620
-Before menses she is more depressed, more anxious, more crying?

272
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:13,510
-Not anymore. I used to have premenstrual syndrome with swelling of the breast but not anymore.

273
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:22,800
-Is she calm now as she gives her case?

274
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:36,050
Because she was very anxious before, she didn't want to do it. How is that she is so calm now?

275
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,290
-It's like that quite often with me. If I deal with something, with a situation or something

276
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:52,300
coming and I decide this is what you are going to do now, then I can go through this.

277
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,300
It's OK now.

278
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:14,280
The only thing I must think is that there is the entire class sitting there next door.

279
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:17,260
-She must not think about the class.

280
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:23,110
-She may not think of this that the entire class is sitting next door.

281
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:35,200
-What about if somebody consoles her, if he shows her tenderness, she likes it?

282
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:40,890
-I like it very much. I didn't use to, before when somebody was coming like that I didn't

283
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:45,350
want to accept it, I didn't believe him. But that's different now. I like it very much and I

284
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:47,730
actually have a longing for it now.

285
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,780
I've got still some short things.

286
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:09,270
I'm scared and frightened easily, if something happens.

287
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:16,360
-Startle. I've always had that.

288
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:29,840
I have a small myoma in my uterus and a couple of years ago I had a mastitis

289
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,030
which was operated.

290
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:51,210
And I had an operation on my thyroid, in German it's called the "cold knot" I don't know

291
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,900
the expression in English.

292
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:06,320
During that time I also had slight depression but after the operation I felt much better.

293
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:22,570
-Now with the depression, what she feels? She feels she wants to stay by herself, she

294
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:34,330
wants to isolate, she wants to cry, she wants to die and whether this has an hour which

295
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:36,170
is better or worse?

296
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:48,410
-Yes, there are times when it's better or when it's worse.

297
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:56,760
-What does she mean? Daytime or just a few days?

298
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:07,750
-Always a few days. The worst thing about the depression is that I couldn't get out of bed.

299
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:14,490
I had no energy whatsoever and I just told myself OK, just stay in bed, relax, maybe

300
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:20,490
you've been doing too much these past years and just stay and wait and it will go by.

301
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:25,320
The bad thing was that it did not go by, it stayed and often when I wake up in the

302
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:28,420
mornings I can just turn around and go back to bed again.

303
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:35,610
The worse part about that is that actually I want to open up my own practice and I want

304
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:40,820
to learn so much, I want to do so much and I actually can't.

305
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:46,580
Then the feeling is that if I can't do this, then I don't want to continue anymore and then

306
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:53,430
I also had thoughts of jumping from a skyscraper of something. From a high building.

307
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,680
Because I have no energy.

308
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:03,410
What I forgot to say is that there is no more energy and what she likes most she can't do.

309
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,510
That creates a deep sadness.

310
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:17,410
And what makes me so said is what I love most, which I used to love most, nature and

311
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:24,660
everything outside, is as if there is a veil between myself and nature and I can't get in

312
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:29,510
contact and I can't just open my heart, as I used to, and feel everything.

313
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:40,160
-When she was trying to get to see her, she was crying a lot.

314
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:43,410
They were telling me that she was crying.

315
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:50,930
Is she crying now? Or it just happened that she cried two days ago?

316
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:57,740
-I could say in the past two years, after I've started dealing with myself it's got a bit

317
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:01,240
easier, which does not mean it's easy.

318
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:04,490
For many years it was not possible at all but now

319
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:09,340
in these past few days in Alonissos, I have had states where I could cry.

320
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:19,080
I often had situations where I felt like crying and I wanted to cry but the feeling was as if

321
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:26,070
it was all cramped inside and it was difficult and then I immediately also told myself

322
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:28,710
come on stop self-pitting of yourself.

323
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:37,300
-Is she affected by heat or cold?

324
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:50,010
-I would never go to any winter holidays because I freeze.

325
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:07,090
After Kali carb. I did get a bit warmed, that was the reaction and I was very happy about that.

326
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:19,830
-What about her extremities? Feet?
-Icy cold.

327
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:27,670
-When she has meat with fat in it, she will eat it or not?

328
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:34,190
-I don't eat meat, very rarely.

329
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:39,310
-Is she vegetarian?
-Yes.

330
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:46,250
-Does she belong to a spiritual group?
-No. I just don't get anything from meat.

331
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:51,340
-But does she pray ever to god?

332
00:42:54,830 --> 00:43:01,070
-Yes. For example before I begin a treatment but it's not like praying in a sense of

333
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:05,670
kneel down, it's just something I do.

334
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:16,700
-Is she constipated?
-No.

335
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:31,820
-She will be going 3 days without having outlet?
-No.

336
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:46,070
-Her nails are soft? Break easily?
-No, they have ridges.

337
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:49,170
-She perspires a lot?

338
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,900
-No but the odor of my perspiration has changed since Kali carbon.

339
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,090
-What it was and what it has become?

340
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:19,890
-Before it was more odorless and now I can sense when I'm perspiring but I can't

341
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,190
really tell you what it smells like.

342
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:28,570
-Does she perspire mostly on axillae or face or...?

343
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:35,330
-Axillae, under the arms.

344
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:49,830
-She never liked meat or now she has become more vegetarian?

345
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:55,970
-It was when the psoriasis started, I dealt with the issue and start reading and

346
00:44:56,070 --> 00:45:00,980
thinking what could I do to improve it and one of the books said that it might not

347
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,500
be so good to eat meat.

348
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,910
-She used to like meat?

349
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:15,890
-I slowly left it away and now I have no desire at all.

350
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:21,140
-Eggs.
-Not at all. I don't eat eggs.

351
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:27,740
-Aversion to eggs. We got the symptom.

352
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:50,330
And if she sees somebody suffering, how she reacts?

353
00:45:52,860 --> 00:46:00,410
She is affected or..? She is sympathetic?

354
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:08,800
-Yes, very. For example now when I work in the hospital and a child has to get an

355
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:17,130
infusion but I also work with my energies and often I succeed to calm the child down.

356
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:22,130
When I was a child, I was always carrying the handbags of some old ladies and

357
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:24,310
I always got engaged.

358
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:31,710
It's somehow that I have to pay attention but I don't put too much of that on myself

359
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:37,710
because then I can get to a point where I not only sympathize but I suffer along with

360
00:46:37,810 --> 00:46:41,070
the people and so I have to find a point to say stop.

361
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:47,150
-Does she have any fears?

362
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:54,800
-In the depression phases, not this time but last time when I was in Alonissos, I could

363
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:59,640
not go into the ocean because I had fear of this dark water.

364
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:09,300
And another thing after watching the Hitchcock movie where the girl is killed through the

365
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:14,830
shower curtain with a knife, for years and years I was not able to take a shower without

366
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:19,930
having my head sticking outside the shower curtain, all the time making sure that there is

367
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:22,390
nobody coming and approaching me.

368
00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:26,960
And as a child I had these dreams when I woke at night and screaming because I always had

369
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:30,560
this feeling that somebody is coming and is going to kill me with a knife.

370
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:46,800
And I stopped watching television for years now already because all this kind of movies

371
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:51,340
I cant' bear, I get so excited and so restless, I can not watch them.

372
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:00,720
But on the other hand, if there is an accident somewhere, I have no problem running

373
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:03,900
there and helping. That's a completely different situation.

374
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:20,630
-Now she is afraid in the dark at all?
-Not anymore. When I was a child yes.

375
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:28,710
-She is afraid of thunderstorms?
-No, I like them.

376
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:37,950
-As a child?
-Yes, as a child I had some fear.

377
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:50,800
-As a child in the dark she would see ghosts with her imagination?

378
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:07,280
-Yes and not only seeing, I also had the impression that I had been touched which led

379
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:08,870
to panic attacks.

380
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:16,710
-Was any time when she was anxious about her own health?

381
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:28,710
What about the health of her own child?

382
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:34,050
She is anxious about him, what is going to happen?

383
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:40,610
-I was always fear about others. For many years I had that, I was afraid that something

384
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:44,860
would happen to my parents and when they wouldn't come home, I was sitting at home

385
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:49,860
crying and be anxious and for many years also with my husband and I had it for

386
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:57,960
several years also concerning my son but that has got better now. Always fear for others.

387
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:05,440
-Now she likes to be by herself or she likes to be with others to communicate?

388
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:33,840
-At the moment I prefer more to be alone but if there is a person with whom I can have

389
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:40,200
a good quite talk, with whom I feel I'm accepted and secure, I like to be with.

390
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:54,850
-Is she very orderly?
-In the meantime yes, as a child no.

391
00:50:56,860 --> 00:51:04,600
-Now very orderly?
-Not very.

392
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:12,360
I like to have things in order but I'm not very fastidious about.

393
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,450
-Fear of death?

394
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:39,090
-Concerning my own death I can't really say. What I experience is in the hospital

395
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:45,620
when a child dies and I'm with it when it dies, it's OK but if I leave the room and

396
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:50,090
shut the door behind me, then I would have to go back because I forgot something

397
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,940
or so then I'm afraid.

398
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:30,680
This is another case of Ignatia.

399
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:47,010
She comes there and she has depression and she is sighing all the time.

400
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:06,930
Who saw her sighing? The others did not see sighing.

401
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:28,170
This is a case of Nat. mur. Why Nat. mur?

402
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:51,820
This is a case of Staphysagria. Because she was suppressing all the time herself

403
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:57,250
she was doing everything for the husband, the husband...

404
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:03,850
-No.

405
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:34,480
-Be careful. Is this a case of Aurum?
-No.

406
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:39,740
-What about Pulsatilla?
-No.

407
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:44,080
-What about Palladium?
-Palladium?

408
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:59,250
-You will be surprised. What is the essence of Palladium?

409
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:08,480
The essence of Palladium, we have not spoken about but there are individuals

410
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:25,490
primarily who want appreciation. Appreciation is the matter with them.

411
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:37,810
They need to be appreciated and to be told. My parents do not appreciate me.

412
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:44,210
My husband does not appreciate me, my teacher does not appreciate me.

413
00:55:44,310 --> 00:56:00,350
If anybody of you, you were Palladium, just say good words, they wait.

414
00:56:01,610 --> 00:56:07,790
You are good, the blood pressure can go down, just one word, it's so important.

415
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:10,260
They have to be appreciated.

416
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:22,130
So when the main issue is, she comes there, she has a depression, she is crying,

417
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:30,700
you must take this case and then I see her there and I realize that the main issue

418
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:38,230
for her is the appreciation from the parents. It's a big issue.

419
00:56:57,970 --> 00:57:05,460
-This sounds strange to me because when a child wants the love of his parents, wants a

420
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:14,220
word of appreciation, a word of acceptance, this is a natural process, even if he needed

421
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:22,060
for a long time and she needed it for a long time, you still think this is pathological.

422
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:34,060
-In Palladium we are talking about pathological condition, that means beyond the normal.

423
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:39,060
What you say is correct. You are not Palladium, so I can praise you.

424
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:52,040
What you say is normal, every child needs somebody to say good words but if your whole life

425
00:57:52,140 --> 00:58:01,150
depends on that few words and you are sick because of that, then you are Palladium.

426
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:25,290
So actually she is Palladium or she was Palladium in the beginning of the evolution of the

427
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:31,540
case. The evolution of the case showed me that most probably the remedy that she will

428
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:40,550
need is Palladium. As the case evolved, did I have reasons to go away from Palladium

429
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:42,640
and to think of another remedy?

430
00:58:45,390 --> 00:58:59,040
There was the time when I could not really pinpoint to any remedy, the possibility of

431
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:09,140
Pulsatilla with what she said, great need for consolation.

432
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:26,650
How many times you have underlined consolation? 4 time? Ah, twice.

433
00:59:39,630 --> 00:59:48,140
-Also in favor of Pulsatilla she said her mood was changing from some...

434
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:51,830
so I put the Pulsatilla.

435
00:59:54,300 --> 01:00:01,060
-But she has other symptoms of Pulsatilla also.

436
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:15,320
Put it there to see how many symptoms of Pulsatilla she has. Only 12 symptoms?

437
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:42,260
18 out of 28. Very good Pulsatilla case. Aversion to salt, consolation ameliorates...

438
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:55,950
Put 4 times consolation ameliorates. The way she said, how many times you underline?

439
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:12,850
Who underlined 3 times consolation? Who underlined it twice? Much less.

440
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:19,850
Who underlined it once? Nobody. OK it is 3 times, she said it quite strongly, you are

441
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:28,930
justified to underline it 3 times. She said it very strongly and if you underline it

442
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:35,030
and you put it in your repertorisation, you give it value.

443
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:44,350
-If you put in all the symptoms, more or less you come up with Phosphorus and with

444
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:51,770
Pulsatilla and what I don't like about it is that looking at her case, she somewhat gives

445
01:01:51,870 --> 01:02:01,510
the impression of certain hardness, the sensitivity inside and the hardness towards

446
01:02:01,610 --> 01:02:08,260
the outside. Also her feeling during childhood of being separated from the world

447
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:16,030
startling easily and also suicidal tendency and especially the aggravation in the mornings

448
01:02:16,130 --> 01:02:23,200
I thought of Anacardium. Anacardium also has skin eruptions on the abdomen.

449
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:50,750
-The skin eruptions of Anacardium are usually with severe itching, more they scratch

450
01:02:50,850 --> 01:03:16,510
the more... I have seen hysteria, this kind. I could not imagine her. She did not mention.

451
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:25,490
Anacardium has skin eruptions and the skin eruptions are terrible and it's a remedy

452
01:03:25,590 --> 01:03:37,000
together with Rhus tox and Rhus venenata but what she said, the idea of the plug she

453
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:38,760
did not press it.

454
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:46,500
I don't even remember it but let us say, you are right but you had to pursue this idea in

455
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:54,250
case this lady was telling us that she could not really accomplish anything because she

456
01:03:54,350 --> 01:03:58,500
would have no confidence in herself.

457
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:07,000
On the contrary, what she said is I establish myself in West Germany. I did this, I did that

458
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:13,100
I took classes, I worked, I did another job and my husband...

459
01:04:15,610 --> 01:04:22,500
Even if the plug idea is there, then you have to go away from this idea.

460
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:32,100
What you say is very correct that outside she looks like Nat. mur.

461
01:04:32,850 --> 01:04:39,520
Her look or the way she handled the situation was quite like Nat. mur.

462
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:44,410
That is how the Nat.mur. will give a case.

463
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:50,170
Even if they feel the pain a lot, they will not show it, they will not cry.

464
01:04:50,270 --> 01:04:55,670
That's why I was wondering at a certain moment she is a Nat. mur. case?

465
01:04:55,770 --> 01:05:06,840
Because she doesn't give out this pain which is inside, she kept it, she closed.

466
01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:21,680
But I will tell you also that I never fix my mind, saying this is the remedy. Never.

467
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:34,330
That is why I make less mistakes than others who fix. This is the case blah, blah, blah.

468
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:41,920
I say yes, most probably. I came to analyze her case thinking of Sulphur.

469
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:55,410
In the process I see they are right, I change, I have no problem because you cannot

470
01:05:55,510 --> 01:05:59,420
go against the truth and say my truth.

471
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:03,910
It's not your truth, you don't have the truth. Who knows exactly what is the remedy?

472
01:06:04,010 --> 01:06:10,160
This is almost god given. To give the correct remedy out of these thousands it is like

473
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:13,760
the biggest present you can give to somebody.

474
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:27,090
You always stand with awe against the case and don't insist. Sometimes I see you insist

475
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:33,430
you press the point, it's good to press the point but then you give up also.

476
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:43,080
-Aurum muriat. she has depression?

477
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:53,420
-Aurum muriat. we have individuals that they have attempted suicide. Aurum muriat.

478
01:06:53,520 --> 01:07:02,760
is one of the main suicidal remedies. That's one thing. She has not attempted suicide.

479
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:15,310
She has thoughts of suicide. The second argument is that she is not praying

480
01:07:15,410 --> 01:07:19,920
in a pathological way, neither she is religious.

481
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:33,820
She is a person who is interested in spiritual matters, so she finds somebody who asks about life,

482
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:46,560
about death, about this and that about spiritual matters and she follows and then when I ask her

483
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:56,980
do you pray she answers, yes but in my way. She has a way of praying. What is her way of praying?

484
01:07:57,080 --> 01:08:05,560
It is to meditate and to think please god help me, help me in this case or something like

485
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:18,810
that, this is not pathological praying. What is the idea of Aurum in praying?

486
01:08:18,910 --> 01:08:25,820
You are in deep depression, that means you see nothing around you that you can hold

487
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:33,810
on, nothing, it is dark, it is stillness, it's like your heart feels like a steel,

488
01:08:33,910 --> 01:08:35,710
it doesn't move.

489
01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:43,460
Your emotions do not exist, you feel almost pain from depression and during that time

490
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:51,240
you see no way out, you are in a dark, total darkness, there is no a ray of light anywhere.

491
01:08:51,340 --> 01:09:00,450
You can not see any light and then the idea comes, I just want to die and then before you

492
01:09:00,550 --> 01:09:09,380
do that, it's like you have the last chance you hold from god and then you say, god help

493
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:20,870
me, god help me, they pray for 2 hours and that releases them a bit.

494
01:09:20,970 --> 01:09:28,630
The tremendous pain which is there it is released, so it is a context under which they

495
01:09:28,730 --> 01:09:34,120
pray, it is this deep depression that leads them to pray.

496
01:09:34,220 --> 01:09:43,620
So therefore in the Repertory you will see it in capital letters and there in capital letters

497
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:55,800
you will see praying is Veratrum also but it's a totally different situation with Veratrum.

498
01:09:55,900 --> 01:10:04,790
Veratrum does not pray because of the depression, it prays because of madness.

499
01:10:04,890 --> 01:10:22,370
The mind has gone already beyond the normal, it's going to pathology as a person who

500
01:10:22,470 --> 01:10:33,120
wants to save the world. The idea behind is that idea of the savior, that is why it says

501
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:51,170
in the book it preaches repent, repent ! He will go in the streets of Munich, he is finished.

502
01:10:51,270 --> 01:10:59,250
Before that state there is a state where they will pray to save the world, they will pray for

503
01:10:59,350 --> 01:11:10,080
others, it's different situation, they are in a manic state and they pray in such a way as

504
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:19,830
to save the world. Aurum prays to save himself because he knows the next step is

505
01:11:19,930 --> 01:11:26,850
jumping from a high place, there is no way out, there is no way out.

506
01:11:29,850 --> 01:11:35,910
It's very strange. I told you the case with the man who telephones and says, tonight

507
01:11:36,010 --> 01:11:42,500
I'm jumping from the cliff, there is no way out, he has decided it. You give Aurum and

508
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:50,500
next day he says, I changed my mind. That means he was in an Aurum state, he would

509
01:11:50,600 --> 01:12:00,990
jump. In the way Aurum was the case that we saw, he took the car, smashed against

510
01:12:01,090 --> 01:12:08,600
the tree, no way, at that moment this is Aurum.

511
01:12:16,930 --> 01:12:25,060
I have been given information, people like the doctor who ...

512
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:32,510
If you talk with them and say, what did you feel? They have described several times

513
01:12:32,610 --> 01:12:40,470
they found themselves in a cliff, higher than this, in the roof of the building and suddenly

514
01:12:40,570 --> 01:12:53,750
comes the idea and says, now it's your time, jump, jump, jump... it goes into a crescendo

515
01:12:53,850 --> 01:13:06,480
and they jump because there is nowhere from which they can hold and Aurum will pray

516
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:17,720
under these circumstances and I do not get this idea with her. Therefore it is I would say

517
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:29,970
a different depression, a depression together with a kind of complaining, why my parents

518
01:13:30,070 --> 01:13:37,320
never loved me, what is wrong with me? That was the case.

519
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:52,780
-I would like to say that she did not mention the plug in the breast. She said she had a

520
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:57,640
blockage and a difficulty to take large breath.

521
01:13:58,470 --> 01:14:06,400
-A deep breath yes, that is what I say sighing. She said I have a shallow breathing,

522
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:14,620
this shallow breathing is characteristic of Ignatia, they feel they can not take

523
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:21,110
a deep breath and they breath on a certain level and the breathing can not really go down

524
01:14:21,210 --> 01:14:24,210
and relax the organism.

525
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:38,610
But whether she said plug or not still in analyzing the case you have to find other

526
01:14:38,710 --> 01:14:42,210
supportive symptoms for the case.

527
01:14:49,940 --> 01:14:56,850
-I completely understood when you say my parents didn't love me and what is wrong

528
01:14:56,950 --> 01:15:15,020
with me and that is why I think I always try to be better, to be good, to perform.

529
01:15:23,290 --> 01:15:30,690
And I think I struggled all my life and now I reach the point where I can't just go on

530
01:15:30,790 --> 01:15:33,030
fighting, there is no energy left.

531
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:47,520
There are many people who know me who say, why do you always make it so difficult for yourself?

532
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:51,270
And I always answer, I can't do it differently.

533
01:16:01,020 --> 01:16:06,260
And I think this is what you perceived that from the outside I make a hard impression but

534
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:12,360
inside I'm very soft and this is the conflict.

535
01:16:15,530 --> 01:16:22,010
-I also wanted to ask you about Phosphorus. Is it so far? Because when she came she

536
01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:28,260
said, I can not breathe deeply, so a Phosphorus would say and she said about

537
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:37,110
clairvoyance and she said when I was a child I could talk to animals and plants.

538
01:16:38,110 --> 01:16:41,860
So the question is, is Phosphorus for you very outside?

539
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:57,360
-But now she feels separated from nature. She has a blockage and she is separated from nature.

540
01:16:59,110 --> 01:17:11,750
-I had Carcinosin one week in Germany and the teacher told us that first remedy when

541
01:17:11,850 --> 01:17:16,190
children from the parents are not loved.

542
01:17:26,690 --> 01:17:31,470
-Perhaps all this comes from misinformation and perhaps I'm responsible for the

543
01:17:31,570 --> 01:17:42,390
misinformation. There are two types. One is the one that wants to please the parents.

544
01:17:42,490 --> 01:17:50,510
Like Staphysagria, they don't care about themselves, they care only about the will of

545
01:17:50,610 --> 01:17:54,350
others. They will do anything to please the parents.

546
01:18:02,610 --> 01:18:10,840
And the other type is the opposite. They will just against anything that the parents will

547
01:18:10,940 --> 01:18:13,090
say, like a bulldozer.

548
01:18:13,190 --> 01:18:18,860
The one type is really thin, the other type is really fat and strong.

549
01:18:22,860 --> 01:18:27,760
Whatever it's proposed, they go against. There are these two types.

550
01:18:27,860 --> 01:18:34,510
The one type who tries to please is very nice person and tries to please.

551
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:46,670
Usually these children are loved by the parents. Carcinosin children I have not seen

552
01:18:46,770 --> 01:18:48,530
a few times I have given...

553
01:18:49,030 --> 01:18:56,990
The parents speak very well about these children, they are very good children, in school

554
01:18:57,090 --> 01:19:03,730
they are excellent, they will be meticulous, they sit and prepare everything,

555
01:19:03,830 --> 01:19:08,320
the parents do nothing, they are amazed, they say it's such a good child.

556
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:13,420
I say, I'll give a remedy and your child will not be so good anymore, have it in mind.

557
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:21,010
It doesn't matter because they feel something is wrong in this behavior.

558
01:19:21,110 --> 01:19:31,240
So if I say children want to please the parents, then somebody may take it as that

559
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:47,580
the child wants to be appreciated, the child wants to be loved but the child is loved.

560
01:19:48,770 --> 01:19:55,160
Here we have not the case. It is not this case.

561
01:19:55,660 --> 01:20:15,030
I believe she did not do everything possible to please the parents, especially when she went

562
01:20:15,130 --> 01:20:27,310
at the age of 17 and she had this affair her father as she said, now my father will kill me.

563
01:20:32,050 --> 01:20:39,200
The Carcinosin child will not do that, will not do anything to displease the parents.

564
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:48,530
Anything. They will do things to please and the parents love these children because the

565
01:20:48,630 --> 01:20:57,130
Carcinosin children are very high IQ. It's like the cancer, it's starting speeding up matters.

566
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,250
They are very intelligent.

567
01:21:08,770 --> 01:21:17,150
The idea of Carcinosin was coming in the Repertory at a certain moment quite strongly

568
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:25,390
but I pushed it out for this reason, I did not see the predisposition in the family,

569
01:21:25,490 --> 01:21:38,240
she did not mention, everybody dying in the family from cancer.

570
01:21:40,990 --> 01:21:48,810
-Just to open the discussion a bit more. I have also seen that Carcinosin children do many things

571
01:21:48,910 --> 01:21:53,050
to please their parents, almost like Nat. mur. has this fear of being rejecting

572
01:21:53,150 --> 01:22:00,070
if they do not please. At the same time in her particular instance that I've seen this before,

573
01:22:00,170 --> 01:22:08,070
if the parents are not forthcoming and responding to the child's desire to love because she has

574
01:22:08,170 --> 01:22:14,810
such a strong experience and develops an independence, since there is no availability

575
01:22:14,910 --> 01:22:19,550
on the part of the parents to give anything to the child, they become independent

576
01:22:19,650 --> 01:22:26,560
and also dependent, depending which way it goes, on the parents or to respond in their

577
01:22:26,660 --> 01:22:30,910
desire to please, then they will go off on their own independent way.

578
01:22:31,660 --> 01:22:40,820
-But don't forget we are talking about pathology here and in these instances pathology

579
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:51,060
and natural reactions are intermingled. What I say, the child does anything to please

580
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:58,560
and not to be in stress in the environment. It's pathology, the parents perceive it

581
01:22:58,660 --> 01:23:09,220
actually they say, the child is very nice. They give some direction to the child, the child

582
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:18,480
will follow the directions. This becomes pathology. The other one starts to be natural.

583
01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:24,750
The child needs to react for a certain period of time, it needs to go out, you can't close

584
01:23:24,850 --> 01:23:33,810
a child. The last case I remember it was a woman 17 years old, she never went out with

585
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:43,650
a boyfriend, only first in school, doing everything correctly, never had a boyfriend, never felt...

586
01:23:44,150 --> 01:23:54,640
The mother was saying, she is too good. So you give the remedy and then the child

587
01:23:54,740 --> 01:24:01,160
starts reacting, that is natural. It starts to be independent, yes of course.

588
01:24:01,660 --> 01:24:10,410
Any child that will be suppressed in this way, naturally it will react, it will leave the house.

589
01:24:10,950 --> 01:24:20,560
Especially in America, you know. Nobody stays. I went to a family with 6-7 children and

590
01:24:20,660 --> 01:24:32,050
they were 2 left in the family, 1 was 11 and the other was 16 or 17 and as we discussed

591
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:37,550
I have this child, I have this child, what happened to the child? Gone, gone, gone all the 5

592
01:24:37,650 --> 01:24:43,310
children were gone, 2 were staying. 1 was 11, very small and the other one and then I

593
01:24:43,410 --> 01:24:52,270
hear the mother saying, I don' t know what is wrong. She wanted me to treat the child.

594
01:24:52,370 --> 01:25:03,760
It was 17 years old and hasn't left the house. By that time it's not conceivable, 17 years

595
01:25:03,860 --> 01:25:05,700
old you leave the house?

596
01:25:07,450 --> 01:25:12,590
And she was complaining that something is wrong with this

597
01:25:12,690 --> 01:25:22,040
child because it has not left the house. The others left it by the age of 14, 15, 16.

598
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:33,180
What happened to the others? The one got into jail because of drugs.

599
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:38,170
The other had 2 years without communication, the other...

600
01:25:40,020 --> 01:25:48,340
That kind of society is creating some problems. You don't know where is the right and

601
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:58,590
where is the wrong. The child must stay with the family, this is correct, until it feels

602
01:25:58,690 --> 01:26:04,310
naturally he must go out and work and support himself. But that's natural, the father

603
01:26:04,410 --> 01:26:09,590
naturally helps the child and the child goes away.

604
01:26:09,690 --> 01:26:18,080
In her case the pathology is that she has a wound because she felt my parents do not

605
01:26:18,180 --> 01:26:32,820
want me and that is a real trauma in her life and there comes a time where she decides

606
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:41,900
I will do my part. I will love them, I will give them, I will hug them, see what happens.

607
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:48,110
And then she says, now I've done this, my parents respond better. This is not the

608
01:26:48,210 --> 01:27:00,920
pathology of Carcinosin. She should have done this, as a Carcinosin child, long time ago

609
01:27:01,910 --> 01:27:09,950
but now she is maturing and she does it out of maturity and out of mental decision.

610
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:15,500
That is not Carcinosin state.

611
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:37,750
Aurum, Nux vomica... Nux vomica is third in this repertorization. Is she Nux vomica?

612
01:27:47,490 --> 01:27:53,490
How many symptoms she has? 20, Nux vomica has 20 symptoms.

613
01:28:29,490 --> 01:28:37,810
Fear of water...she said dark water, don't put fear of water, it's not correct.

614
01:28:45,790 --> 01:28:54,700
-I want to ask you if this that the extremities are cold, does this exclude Pulsatilla

615
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:56,090
from this case?

616
01:28:56,830 --> 01:29:10,900
-No. She is freezing cold, she said I freeze, it's a very cold remedy, you have to find

617
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:19,990
a cold remedy. Pulsatilla sometimes is chilly but not in this way, not so strong.

618
01:29:25,990 --> 01:29:30,970
The spiritual, we didn't go to these issues because they are difficult issues to be

619
01:29:31,070 --> 01:29:39,150
discussed in public but I will tell you my perception from her, what was happening.

620
01:29:39,660 --> 01:29:46,480
She goes into a spiritual group, she found some people interested in spiritual matters

621
01:29:46,580 --> 01:29:55,720
and somebody suggests that if you go inside yourself, if you take that drug and you

622
01:29:55,820 --> 01:29:57,330
discover things...

623
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:10,140
She has been suffering because of the life, parents and then the husband and she is

624
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:20,730
in a time of sensitivity where she tries to find a solution for her inner suffering.

625
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:27,890
Why do I suffer inertly? Why do I have that need that my parents will love me?

626
01:30:27,990 --> 01:30:36,620
What is this? The hell with you...This is more or less the situation I perceive she is in.

627
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:44,610
The somebody says, take this and you will understand. It's like psychotherapists will

628
01:30:44,710 --> 01:30:55,790
say, take lithium or valium and calm down your anxiety.

629
01:30:55,890 --> 01:31:04,340
Instead of taking a drug of that type, valium, tavor, lithium or whatever, she takes this

630
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:13,430
drug. I don't consider it as pathology at this moment, that means a pathological drive

631
01:31:13,530 --> 01:31:16,430
towards the spiritual and I consider it why?

632
01:31:16,530 --> 01:31:24,930
Because when I enquire a little bit into the issue, she said this is gone, this is past.

633
01:31:25,030 --> 01:31:33,100
I'm involved so much anymore. A person who has pathology, a Sepia will follow and

634
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:44,090
lose the energy, she will go into that, the idea of detachment, I want to detach, I don't

635
01:31:44,190 --> 01:31:51,340
want to love anybody, I don't want to be connected and that is how it is produced the

636
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:56,590
state of detachment of Sepia, which I have been talking about.

637
01:31:56,690 --> 01:32:05,340
With her feelings are strong and that's why the suffering is strong and with her also

638
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:11,630
we see the opposite, I want to love my parents in spite of that because she fought inside

639
01:32:11,730 --> 01:32:18,180
herself to come to the point to say, in spite of the fact you have rejected me, you didn't

640
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:24,180
love me, you didn't give me tenderness, attention, I have to love you, I must love you,

641
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:26,230
I love you.

642
01:32:26,730 --> 01:32:36,590
She has done some inner work inside to be able to reach that point where she can hug

643
01:32:36,690 --> 01:32:49,690
the parents, I forgive you, it doesn't matter. Am I correct? She says, yes.

644
01:32:57,440 --> 01:33:08,190
And then sexually, we didn't discuss her sexual desire but I can see it is OK, normal.

645
01:33:17,190 --> 01:33:19,690
I would say normal, I didn't say anything.

646
01:33:23,940 --> 01:33:28,680
-I was sitting yesterday for hours thinking about this case and turning it and looking at it

647
01:33:28,780 --> 01:33:35,930
from different directions and I kept stumbling over this one symptom. She told that she

648
01:33:36,030 --> 01:33:42,180
had been afraid of knives for years after watching the psycho film by Hitchcock

649
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:47,930
where the woman was stabbed through the shower curtain and now my question is

650
01:33:48,030 --> 01:33:51,180
how do you judge this symptom in the whole context?

651
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:59,610
-Before let us see the evaluation of your understanding.

652
01:34:13,860 --> 01:34:19,020
-What I had as a child also, it's more the fear of being murdered, I was always afraid

653
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:21,610
that somebody would come and murder me.

654
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:42,510
-And these dreams continued after that time but only the intervals got a lot larger.

655
01:34:42,610 --> 01:34:55,340
They came like twice the year. It's more this maddening fear that somebody is going

656
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:57,690
to kill me, to murder me.

657
01:35:20,940 --> 01:35:30,680
-But also she said that she can not see violence. When I ask her how much sympathetic

658
01:35:30,780 --> 01:35:40,430
she was, she brought as an example the fact that she will not see television because

659
01:35:40,530 --> 01:35:53,860
what she sees in television comes in her and affects her. The violence, she feels it inside.

660
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:13,510
-What I'm missing most is a kind of a place which is secure, which I'm looking in myself

661
01:36:13,610 --> 01:36:16,860
and I can't find it, a place where I experience security.

662
01:36:29,140 --> 01:36:34,010
People often have the impression that I have a lot of self-confidence which is probably

663
01:36:34,110 --> 01:36:39,360
true to a certain extend but I, myself inside do not feel it.

664
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:55,590
And concerning the other question which emotions I like and feel strongest, I can only

665
01:36:55,690 --> 01:37:03,190
answer all, I can feel everything from up and down, the whole range, I can feel very strong.

666
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:15,770
-OK, we analyzed this case as we do and we think about all these matters. We think as

667
01:37:15,870 --> 01:37:29,170
the case goes by. You think is this? No. Is that? No, no, no, yes. This is how more or less

668
01:37:29,270 --> 01:37:37,180
you are doing the inner repertorization, helped by the repertorization of course of the

669
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:46,510
Repertory. From time to time you look at the Repertory, fear of being murdered, I want

670
01:37:46,610 --> 01:37:51,760
to look or different other symptoms and then finally something brings together the case

671
01:37:51,860 --> 01:37:56,450
and you say now, what do we need to do with this case?

672
01:37:56,550 --> 01:38:05,160
This case used to be a case of Phosphorus, it's obvious. As a child she had the fears

673
01:38:05,260 --> 01:38:17,520
she had the mentality of the child, she would go to the parents to sleep with the parents.

674
01:38:22,100 --> 01:38:28,750
She could not stay alone, she go to the parents and then she still in between them and

675
01:38:28,850 --> 01:38:49,000
still is not secure, she sees the ghosts. Then she goes through life needing that affection

676
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:58,000
which she did not receive from the parents, then she attaches herself to the man she

677
01:38:58,100 --> 01:39:07,000
married and then there is this divorce and then there is this barrier that comes.

678
01:39:07,100 --> 01:39:18,020
The only question that we have to put once the case has progressed, the only question

679
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:26,750
is, does she need now another remedy and then Phosphorus or shall we go and give

680
01:39:26,850 --> 01:39:28,500
Phosphorus straight away?

681
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:32,680
Why don't we go and give straight away, immediately the whole class...

682
01:39:33,680 --> 01:39:40,580
Do you know why? Who can tell me why the whole class did not say after this taking of the case,

683
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:46,080
this is a case of Phosphorus? Do you know why? What has gone through as information

684
01:39:46,180 --> 01:39:51,180
in your mind that stopped you from saying Phosphorus? Do you know what it is?

685
01:39:55,420 --> 01:40:02,820
-She likes thunderstorms, she likes to be alone in thunderstorms and not complain.

686
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:08,570
-When this depression comes on, she goes to bed and rather not get up from bed and

687
01:40:08,670 --> 01:40:15,070
then she also feels very difficult if she gets hurt, to close up,

688
01:40:15,170 --> 01:40:18,210
so I think it must be Ignatia.

689
01:40:19,420 --> 01:40:27,820
-Unrefreshed sleep. She goes and sleeps, she is very tired, she just wants to go back.

690
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:36,680
So she has a sleep which is unrefreshed, find me unrefreshed sleep.

691
01:40:54,820 --> 01:41:01,430
This should not put you out of Phosphorus, she wakes up, she is terrible, she is

692
01:41:01,530 --> 01:41:09,630
unrefreshed, it can not put you out but what put you really out of Phosphorus was when

693
01:41:09,730 --> 01:41:15,970
I asked her, do you want cold drinks or hot drinks?

694
01:41:17,980 --> 01:41:40,460
And she said, temperature. She said but if I had a choice, I would prefer to have warm drinks.

695
01:41:47,590 --> 01:41:55,070
So cold drinks and what else, what was the information that came?

696
01:42:01,010 --> 01:42:07,580
She did not say she loves to be alone, she said, sometimes I like to be with people but

697
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:12,170
sometimes also I like to be alone, correct?

698
01:42:18,090 --> 01:42:27,840
Arsenicum very good is a possibility also, especially by the end of the interview.

699
01:42:30,090 --> 01:42:38,590
I was putting some questions concerning Arsenicum to which she answered negatively.

700
01:42:44,590 --> 01:42:53,920
You could take her as Arsenicum case because she is careful with her appearance.

701
01:42:54,670 --> 01:43:01,170
You can take her and the freezing is there and the warm drinks is there.

702
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:09,260
How is her anxiety about her health?

703
01:43:22,510 --> 01:43:26,450
-I think I paid attention to my health but not in anxious way,

704
01:43:26,550 --> 01:43:29,290
I just did something to remain healthy.

705
01:43:34,840 --> 01:43:43,740
What I do, which is not good for my health, is that I'm smoking right now and I would

706
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:48,180
imagine if I had great anxiety about my health, I would not smoke.

707
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:29,260
-Love thunderstorm is not only Carcinosin. You have to be careful about these symptoms.

708
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:38,660
A thunderstorm is a phenomenon which is enjoyed by many people. Not everybody is

709
01:44:38,760 --> 01:44:50,410
Carcinosin but if during the thunderstorm you feel good, that can be Sepia,

710
01:44:52,260 --> 01:44:56,940
maybe Carcinosin but don't pay too much attention to this.

711
01:45:01,880 --> 01:45:08,250
Some ordinary symptoms of every day life, they have been recorded as symptoms of

712
01:45:08,350 --> 01:45:13,740
Carcinosin and that's why in your repertorization Carcinosin will come again and again

713
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:21,660
and again. This is not so frequent. I have a student of mine who gives only Carcinosin

714
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:37,410
to everyone. He claims he has 80% cures. I mean it, really. He is not a student of mine.

715
01:45:37,510 --> 01:45:44,340
That's wrong. He is the only Greek who says I'm not a student of George Vithoulkas.

716
01:45:45,540 --> 01:45:50,740
He is supposed to have learned somewhere in Germany, only Carcinosin and it's finished.

717
01:45:50,840 --> 01:46:06,940
It's very successful practice. I have another one, another student, he is really my student

718
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:16,420
who gives 60% of his cases, he gives Nat. mur. and a lot of them will feel better because

719
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:25,340
there is really quite a lot of grief, so Nat. mur. will release a little bit of that grief.

720
01:46:28,340 --> 01:46:39,990
The question is that remedy unfolds, makes the case open? This is the question.

721
01:46:40,090 --> 01:46:45,840
To make it a little bit better, to feel a little bit better, this is not the objective.

722
01:46:46,340 --> 01:46:52,990
So we are searching for her because if you give to her Ignatia, she will feel better

723
01:46:53,090 --> 01:47:00,600
for a while, a little bit more free, you give Nat. mur, also she will feel better.

724
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:14,990
Psorinum for instance just before the storm they feel great but really that symptom has

725
01:47:15,090 --> 01:47:16,590
to be strong.

726
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:58,320
Show me the Repertorisation. Put aversion eggs, it has been added several remedies.

727
01:47:58,420 --> 01:48:07,170
Pulsatilla has been added and Nit. acid was there originally, why they put my name there?

728
01:48:08,710 --> 01:48:13,910
Nitric acid, Phosphorus, Sulphur and Ferrum and Kali sulph.

729
01:48:14,010 --> 01:48:16,760
these remedies were original remedies...

730
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:46,760
For me the problem, as I took the case, the problem was, she was Phosphorus.

731
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:55,830
Definitely the way she described herself she had a Phosphorus layer and for me the

732
01:48:55,930 --> 01:49:02,670
problem was is she continuing with the same layer or it has changed.

733
01:49:03,430 --> 01:49:04,680
That was the main issue.

734
01:49:07,420 --> 01:49:17,080
What Phosphorus symptoms continue until today as she relates. It's first of all the

735
01:49:17,180 --> 01:49:25,580
sympathetic element, very sympathetic because the way she described it, if we put back

736
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:33,820
the video, you will see how she describes the sympathy for others, she can not tolerate.

737
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:43,680
She will feel herself. She used words that usually describe Phosphorus, that if they suffer

738
01:49:43,780 --> 01:49:57,430
I feel the suffering in myself, I suffer the same. That is one strong point apart from the

739
01:49:57,530 --> 01:50:05,100
depression. We have the depression, we have the morning aggravation of the depression

740
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:16,300
that's correct but we have this sympathetic element very strong that carries on the idea of

741
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:22,150
Phosphorus and the other is the aversion to eggs.

742
01:50:24,190 --> 01:50:27,940
The way she described it, very strongly.

743
01:50:28,780 --> 01:50:35,310
So these two symptoms, sympathetic and aversion to eggs give Phosphorus.

744
01:50:36,060 --> 01:50:43,510
She was Phosphorus, now what prevents us from giving Phosphorus it was that the

745
01:50:43,610 --> 01:50:49,860
quantity of liquid she needs is quite strong, there is no problem there.

746
01:50:49,960 --> 01:51:00,590
What is the problem? When she says, I would prefer warm drinks. The freezing is in

747
01:51:00,690 --> 01:51:19,100
favor of Phosphorus as well. Difficult of deep breathing, that's very interesting but

748
01:51:19,200 --> 01:51:30,590
the fear of being murdered which again from a very young age, she has this symptom until today,

749
01:51:30,690 --> 01:51:37,830
this is carrying again the idea of Phosphorus and then this,

750
01:51:39,680 --> 01:51:48,940
I just saw it now difficulty to breath deeply.

751
01:51:58,430 --> 01:52:07,670
That is something which puts the seal in her case and gives the solution, that symptom

752
01:52:07,770 --> 01:52:23,920
that we just found. We have the carrying through of the same remedy, from the child

753
01:52:24,020 --> 01:52:34,580
who is afraid in the night, she wakes up and sees all these ghosts and fears, she has to

754
01:52:34,680 --> 01:52:42,100
be taken to the ... and feel a little bit secure.

755
01:52:42,200 --> 01:52:47,670
She develops by her own will into something else and eventually she comes to the point

756
01:52:47,770 --> 01:52:55,170
where she says, I have a barrier now. But I have discussed about the idea of Phosphorus

757
01:52:55,270 --> 01:53:03,920
being a very sensitive Phosphorus, they don't want communication with others because

758
01:53:04,020 --> 01:53:10,170
they feel so much the pain, they are totally isolated. I had described a case where she

759
01:53:10,270 --> 01:53:15,330
stayed inside the house all the time, she would not go and buy something in the super

760
01:53:15,430 --> 01:53:19,430
market because she would meet people there and she would feel the pain.

761
01:53:20,930 --> 01:53:27,070
So Phosphorus can go to the other extreme as well that becomes isolated in order to

762
01:53:27,170 --> 01:53:37,990
protect himself. For these reasons we have to give Phosphorus apart from the last

763
01:53:38,090 --> 01:53:45,740
symptom, which I consider it a very important symptom because this is exactly what she

764
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:53,490
said, she had difficulty in taking deep breaths. She says my breathing is superficial which

765
01:53:53,590 --> 01:53:57,840
explains it as an Ignatia symptom.

766
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:20,990
My god, why don't you put this? If somebody had opened the Repertory and looked at

767
01:54:21,090 --> 01:54:24,990
these symptoms would not have the problems that we had.

768
01:54:27,340 --> 01:54:34,090
I had a problem to come and tell you this is typical because you would jump on me.

769
01:54:40,680 --> 01:54:41,710
-I saved you.

770
01:54:42,420 --> 01:54:51,070
-Yes because when we come to the class and we discussed this case, she asked me what's this?

771
01:54:51,170 --> 01:54:58,820
I said, typical Phosphorus, before we entered the class but then when I saw the reaction of the class

772
01:54:58,920 --> 01:55:00,930
I said George go slowly.

773
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:13,840
But these two symptoms make a case, Phosphorus 10M.
