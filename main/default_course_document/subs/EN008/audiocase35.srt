1
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:32,800
I shall give you first the symptomatology; we try to study the symptomatology first.

2
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:39,880
And then because I've seen that case myself I shall describe to you the type of the person

3
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:48,120
and see whether what I describe if it comes with what it came down as a result

4
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:53,170
or maybe it will change all together our decision.

5
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:59,670
So this is what we call the essence of the case vs the totality of the symptoms

6
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:02,400
or the keynotes symptomatology.

7
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,840
And then we shall see, we will think together which is the best solution.

8
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:30,600
This is a girl of 22 years old, she is the fiancÃ© of one of the medical students

9
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:39,080
that were interested in Homeopathy. That case came in 1977.

10
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,420
The case is a case of psoriasis.

11
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:24,490
Actually the real diagnosis is a psoriasis which is with very small...

12
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:36,340
Punctate. In this case is on the whole body.

13
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:50,070
This is better in the summer and worse grief underlined 3 times

14
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:56,750
and better when the emotions are positive.

15
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:02,670
Worse grief 3 times, better joy 2 times.

16
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:10,730
Worse in winter of course where the whole body is covered

17
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:16,240
and there is only one exception that in the head remains throughout the year.

18
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,340
It does not go away from the head.

19
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:32,040
That state of affairs started 6 years ago after a fright.

20
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:43,480
The fright was that she saw a snake in the country, where she had been.

21
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:56,330
And the fright was so much that the next day this state of rapid eruption started growing.

22
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:15,990
When these spots appeared, the first time that they appear, they break out,

23
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:20,830
they have itching. Otherwise the itching stops.

24
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:41,930
A tachycardia, which causes a kind of dyspnea, as if she cannot breathe...

25
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:58,660
She has claustrophobia. She is very much afraid of going into a lift,

26
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:05,260
where too many people are gathered and this is underlined 3 times.

27
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,650
She says, she has a fear for thunderstorm

28
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:23,530
because she had witnessed a thunder to go and hit an old man, almost in front of her

29
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:27,340
and since then she is afraid of thunderstorms.

30
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:45,330
Desires and aversions. There is desire for sweets.

31
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,340
First desire for chicken, which is underlined 3 times.

32
00:05:54,580 --> 00:06:03,270
Then desire sweets, desire salt without any underline,

33
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:08,920
desire orange juice without underline, thirst is normal,

34
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:24,670
her reaction to temperature is normal, worse heat rather without underline.

35
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:34,320
She never sits in the sun without going constantly in the sea.

36
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:39,160
She goes in the sea to make herself wet and she goes out.

37
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:45,080
That means she cannot stay under the sun directly and constantly.

38
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:56,930
Intolerance of tight clothes and I have underlined at first 3 times.

39
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:27,400
Then on enquiry I found out that she could wear a turtleneck. She can wear that.

40
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:34,550
When I asked her about tight clothes, she said I cannot have tight clothes.

41
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:44,890
The reaction was such that I underlined 3 times but then on studying the case...

42
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,890
I have noted 3 remedies.

43
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:51,130
I first prescribe one remedy, I cross it out, then a second remedy, I close it down

44
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:56,740
and then I gave a third one from what I see from my notes here.

45
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:08,550
I went back and I checked how much that intolerance of tight clothes was

46
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:14,480
and I saw that she could wear that turtleneck.

47
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:34,070
She sleeps on the sides and abdomen.

48
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,410
She is very sympathetic.

49
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:54,390
The menses, the last few months, have become scanty,

50
00:08:54,490 --> 00:09:04,110
where in older times she used to have menses 12 days in succession.

51
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:22,250
When I asked her about dreams, she said that she was very clairvoyant.

52
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:34,060
She could see very clearly incidents that were going to happen.

53
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,560
She has difficulty in concentration.

54
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,740
She does not sleep well.

55
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:18,820
Better in the sea, underlined once, feet cold, underlined twice biting her nails.

56
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:32,660
This is the case which we try to solve.

57
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:43,300
-How much she weights?

58
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:54,900
-She is a normal height and physique, not skinny, absolutely normal.

59
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:04,480
I gave you that whole information because it is very didactic to see what happens actually

60
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,010
when you take a case.

61
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:13,800
You get a symptom and you go to reexamine it and you have it in two or nothing

62
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,730
and the opposite is happening, you just bypass it and you go there

63
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:20,080
and you see it's very strong.

64
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:23,390
So cross examination is very good thing to do

65
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:29,390
in case you are going to base your prescription on that symptom. Always I do that.

66
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:33,280
If I shall rely on certain symptomatology, I go back

67
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,770
while I'm studying the case in front of the person, I go back and check it.

68
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:41,970
You said it is worse heat, what do you mean exactly?

69
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:48,290
How much heat do you have? To evaluate myself what is going on really.

70
00:11:51,290 --> 00:12:01,410
I have given you some information to see the inside of this person through symptomatology.

71
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:08,010
Just to take a deeper look into her make-up.

72
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:16,410
What is this information which shows it?

73
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:22,660
-One thing is definitely the clairvoyant dreams, she has difficulty concentration

74
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:34,270
and all the reaction she shows when she happy, joyfull...

75
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:50,090
-I'm standing on that observation.

76
00:12:52,340 --> 00:13:01,130
She said that she looks unstable, how your phrased it?

77
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:04,320
-Unstable.

78
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:12,690
-Being worse grief and better joy in her condition.

79
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:31,050
She calls that instability.
-Because it is suggestible.

80
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:34,740
-You call it suggestible?

81
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:44,390
-In other words most patients have a symptom and not a normal reaction.

82
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:56,720
So my question was really that reaction was and indication (?)

83
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,970
-I don't understand if you understood what I said.

84
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:06,720
I said that psoriasis is worse with grief 3 times and better joy 2 times.

85
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:17,820
That means if she had emotions in positive state, the psoriasis goes.

86
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:27,490
What that means actually?
-She is very open.

87
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:34,890
-She is very open but symptoms are changeable.

88
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:45,630
-I see a diffusion of emotions...

89
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:54,980
-Yes but here we have the pathology affected in a very amazing way by the emotions.

90
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:02,130
The emotions are strong or weak?
-Strong.

91
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:12,130
-Very strong. Emotions within the person must be very strong.

92
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:16,490
To affect the pathology, great emotion.

93
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:20,600
So that we take into consideration.

94
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:30,350
That the emotions are deep and strong in order to affect the pathology.

95
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:44,600
Who wants to make another analysis?

96
00:15:45,850 --> 00:16:02,100
-I thought of Phosphorus because and that to change (?) with joy and grief as an openness.

97
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:15,000
-Now the biting of the nails with 2, does it go with openness or closed person?

98
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,670
-Closed.

99
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:32,340
-You have not seen these people? That state is open or close?

100
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,500
-Close.

101
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,100
-Who says close? Who says open?

102
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:56,600
A person who expresses and interacts openly would do that?

103
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:13,680
It is the absolute, outward sign that a person is closed, it does not express his emotions.

104
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:31,920
And especially when they are in agony...they bite their nails.

105
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:36,510
It's a sign of being closed definitely.

106
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:50,840
You don't agree?
-No I agree. I can see that the nervous energy...

107
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:58,090
-The nervous energy which is not expressing itself in a natural way.

108
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:03,430
It's not expressing, it's not coming out, it's not interacting with the outside world.

109
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:10,340
There are emotions going on inside there that cannot be held by the individual

110
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,450
and the last resort it is to do some nervous action,

111
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:22,850
where it releases that nervous tension, which is inside.

112
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,750
-Openess what do you mean?

113
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:30,840
-Openess of character. I'm angry with her and I tell her.

114
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:37,190
I don't have to bite my nails instead of telling her that I'm angry with her.

115
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:43,940
I'm expressing myself, I don't have to do it.

116
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:55,270
-In chicken...

117
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:01,180
-In chicken yes, Graphites is strong.

118
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:14,330
Who agrees with Phosphorus? It doesn't matter because it's closed

119
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:16,760
it cannot be Phosphorus.

120
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,360
So Graphites.

121
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:47,350
-Worse in grief and worse from (?)

122
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,180
-Who is in favor of Graphites?

123
00:19:55,430 --> 00:20:00,520
-What you try to keep us away from Lachesis?

124
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,100
-Who is favor of Lachesis?

125
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:58,680
-Argentum nitricum.
-Phosphoric acid.

126
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:12,930
-I don't know enough on Phosphoric acid.

127
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:24,750
-This is not Phosphoric acid. Phosphoric acid we said yesterday you need to have...

128
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:37,830
If you take the diagram of the emotions of Phosphoric acid is this.

129
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:44,680
No emotions, emotions are dead.

130
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:54,420
This is actually a case where emotions are like that compared to the normal state.

131
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:59,770
In that case they are very strong and deep and not expressed.

132
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:11,170
Emotions, which are deep felt but not expressed, inhibited.

133
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:16,390
That is why I asked you whether you are familiar with the Theory.

134
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:26,490
Pascero in the theory of the miasms , which says that the 3 miasms.

135
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:32,220
He describes them...the psoric miasm as inhibition,

136
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:44,050
the syphilitic miasm describes it as distortion, pervesion

137
00:22:44,150 --> 00:23:00,050
and the sycotic miasm as eruption, as an expression of big eruption.

138
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:09,130
Big emotions that are expressed, extrovert and it grows tumors etc.

139
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:18,910
According to this classification of Pascero, we said very grossly now

140
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:23,660
but the whole book comes down to these 3 points,

141
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:32,660
in which of the 3 you would put this girl?
-Psoric.

142
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:41,150
-Psoric and sycotic?
-Psoric is inhibition.

143
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:50,090
She inhibits the symptoms. That is a perfect case of inhibition.

144
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:18,410
-I thought of Aconite. The reason I thought it is because she was frightened

145
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:26,600
and she had highlighted the claustrophobia...

146
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:38,570
-Going on a superficial level to counteract the fright, we may give Aconitum

147
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:42,580
but also Aconitum has a picture of its own,

148
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:47,570
which has to be there before you can give it.

149
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:55,240
If you give Aconitum on the assumption that there is a fright, which causes the disease,

150
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:59,870
very few times you will succeed.

151
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:03,760
-Can you say something more about Aconitum?

152
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:14,120
-With Aconitum the expression is much bigger and more vital.

153
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,720
For instance palpitations.

154
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,700
But palpitations which are strong and will not cause dyspnea.

155
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:26,820
This is a palpitation where you see a problem with the heart really.

156
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:32,790
She is 22 years old and she has to lie down with dyspnea.

157
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:41,540
That's a case where emotions have been inhibited and have affected the heart.

158
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,300
The heart is quite affected, if you take in consideration

159
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,540
that there is already an eruption in the skin and the heart

160
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:57,540
in spite of the expression of that eruption being outside the heart is affected.

161
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:10,290
22 years old most probably she has an affection from inheritance concerning the heart

162
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:12,890
because she is too young.

163
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:19,140
The expression is on the skin of a very big eruption and yet the heart is affected.

164
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:26,150
That means it shows a predisposition with the heart already from the parents.

165
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:34,720
Usually when the heart is affected in the children,

166
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:46,320
we have the sycotic miasm coming through to the children.

167
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:55,790
The sycotic miasm produces a heart attack at the age of 40, 42, 45.

168
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:05,830
In younger age when the person is vital still, it produces a heart attack which is fatal.

169
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:18,030
These people who have children, the children have either problems with the kidneys

170
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:20,110
or with the heart.

171
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:24,610
You asked what age did your father died? Is your father alive? No, died.

172
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:28,360
When? Age 45. From what? Heart disease.

173
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:31,860
You are like prophet.

174
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,360
If you see the sycotic miasm, if you see the kidneys affected...

175
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:43,370
and that was the case actually with a doctor we had from Norway.

176
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:51,610
She was working for the government in Norway and she came to investigate

177
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:57,610
or to see what our Center is doing actually

178
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:03,460
because she is working for the government in security.

179
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:12,610
She came down and she talks to me and I have a kidney problem.

180
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:23,360
And what I look, what I said was that your father most probably died in a young age

181
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:29,210
from heart attack. She jumped, she said yes that's the case.

182
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:39,610
I did that to impress her and to show what we are doing here.

183
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:45,860
Do you know anything about Medicine? That impressed her much more

184
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,210
than the Theory I was trying to get through to her.

185
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:59,130
She was coming the next day. What did you say? How did you say it works?

186
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:04,360
Again I started all over. The third day again, how did you say it works?

187
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:09,300
Third time to explain. It won't go through the Theory.

188
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:16,200
When we became more friendly, then we started talking more.

189
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:21,700
She gave me some information. I said this most probably has happened.

190
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:26,660
This is because we have a line of thinking. She was impressed.

191
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:33,860
It's not something that you can do for sure every time.

192
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,860
You have to be absolutely sure what you are talking about, otherwise...

193
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:44,550
Many times he had survived the heart attack and he lived to the age of 70.

194
00:29:53,540 --> 00:30:01,800
I have written down here Natrum muriaticum first 1M. I crossed it out.

195
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:07,800
Then I've written Phosphorus. I crossed it out.

196
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:14,100
Then I wrote the medicine in 200.

197
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:27,880
You see I talk with her more now. Nat. muriaticum? No, something is lacking.

198
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:38,360
There is this closed person but the emotions are inside in a state of much more strength

199
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,450
than the Nat muriaticum people.

200
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,520
The Nat muriaticum are like the English.

201
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:51,530
Somebody said yesterday, the English men who control all emotions.

202
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:55,460
They control emotions.

203
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:02,460
She could not control the emotions. The emotions were arising and affecting so much.

204
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:08,360
I said this does not go with the essence.

205
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:21,720
Then she was a very nice girl but so inhibited, so inside.

206
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:26,640
She had difficulty in communicating, in talking.

207
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:44,540
There is a biting of the nails, there is strong emotions that cannot be communicated.

208
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,630
I asked her whether she was going steady with that man.

209
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:54,450
That was the only man she was going out from much younger age

210
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:58,560
and she never thought of another man.

211
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:22,550
Lack of self-confidence was there, lack of self-confidence and embarrassment.

212
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:27,150
She felt embarrassment very easily.

213
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:46,540
Can anybody remember from my teaching of the remedies in which remedy

214
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:55,640
I referred to you as a polarity on a second type of person?

215
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:07,140
Do you know?
-What was the question?

216
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:16,040
-If anybody of you that listened to my lectures remembers the description

217
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:24,140
of such a type of case in one of the remedies which I have given?

218
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:44,620
That inhibited type, inhibited person that will not be able to communicate very well.

219
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:50,870
-Medorrhinum?
-Medorrhinum you remember?

220
00:33:52,980 --> 00:34:00,210
What I had in front of me as essence is concerned, that strong emotions

221
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:02,950
which cannot be communicated? You don't remember?

222
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:06,630
When I give the lectures, of course you can't remember everything

223
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:13,980
but it is very helpful if you do remember.

224
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:26,460
You know Medorrhinum, we all know Medorrhinum as the extrovert who has sex,

225
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:31,800
who goes from woman to woman, he expresses himself.

226
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:36,780
But I have commented to you in Medorrhinum and I said be careful

227
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:40,870
there is another type, which is inhibited.

228
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:51,540
And I remember I had described a case where she could not talk.

229
00:34:51,640 --> 00:35:03,280
She came in front of us with her boyfriend and it was impossible to talk.

230
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:13,530
She was taking a lot of alcohol to be able to talk and yet she was so inhibited,

231
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:19,280
she wouldn't talk. That state.

232
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:28,540
We miss many cases that we don't know that inside of how the remedy behaves

233
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,780
and we take the symptomatology and we cannot make it out.

234
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,030
And we miss many cases.

235
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:41,880
I remember cases, which later on when I came to the understanding of the remedies

236
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:49,960
I said my god that case was Medorrhinum or that case was Mercury.

237
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:54,540
Because Mercury also has that inhibition.

238
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:03,890
Mercury has a lot of inhibitions and cannot talk and will statter.

239
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:09,040
In this way he will talk.

240
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:15,540
-Lachesis also has that?
-Lachesis is inside.

241
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:26,370
She will say something to hurt you, she will present her case, she won't say I'm jealous

242
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:29,990
but she will say something to imply that.

243
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:44,200
It's a whole lecture if I give that and I don't want to go to it. You will be confused.

244
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:47,800
We have biting of the nails in the next rubric.

245
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:56,050
We have reasons to go with the Nat mur and Phosphorus definitely.

246
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,800
Other remedies I do not see.

247
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:13,040
An interesting thing is that in claustrophobia, Medorrhinum is not mentioned anywhere.

248
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:23,720
And claustrophobia has been totally eliminated by Medorrhinum here in this case.

249
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:34,250
If we have claustrophobia in Medorrhinum now, in your Repertories you may insert it.

250
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:44,730
We had the heart, which is affected and which shows the sycotic miasm.

251
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:51,250
We have the desire for orange juice, we have the biting of the nails, which is capital.

252
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:56,070
We have the whole character to go by, what is left?

253
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:02,820
There is nothing left that cannot tally with Medorrhinum.

254
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,720
-The clairvoyance?

255
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:15,910
-The clairvoyance dreams come a lot with Medorrhinum.

256
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,670
I don't think that Kent mentioned that.

257
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:29,660
Clairvoyance is not Medorrhinum?
-It is.

258
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,820
-Sure it affected my thinking because I put things together.

259
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,900
When I see that character, that girl...

260
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:59,060
The husband was in the medical school, I took the case myself

261
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:05,980
and I gave great favor to her and they wanted me so much to see her myself.

262
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:14,060
She had great respect for me and yet she won't talk, she was very inhibited.

263
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:19,060
You could see a person that the emotions were alive inside

264
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:28,250
and she gives the indication that the emotions are strong but not able to be expressed.

265
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:37,400
This is a case where it goes totally away from that theory.

266
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:42,400
When the theory is not really valid, it doesn't hold good.

267
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:51,160
This is a perfect case of psoriasis, of psoric miasm according to that theory

268
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:55,250
and then you give Medorrhinum, the number one sycotic.

269
00:39:55,780 --> 00:40:00,750
And then the essence and you say this is the psoric side of Medorrhinum.

270
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:09,320
You can make anyhing but what is left from the miasms?

271
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,810
So the miasms are not that.

272
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:14,900
One day they might be able to speak about the miasms

273
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:21,220
and I shall give you some information concerning the miasms of how I evaluate them,

274
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:27,330
how I see recognize them and what value they play in prescribing.

275
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:32,650
They do not play such a tremendous value in prescribing.

276
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:39,250
They play a value in prescribing for long periods of time.

277
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:47,080
But they play very mild part in finding the first or the second remedy.

278
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:54,020
That's why novices who do not even know the theory of miasms,

279
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:57,130
can spot the remedy very quickly.

280
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:07,490
The understanding of the layers is the miasms and plus indications,

281
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:12,990
which I hope one day when these things will have been clarified,

282
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:17,930
then my thinking I shall give it out to you.

283
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:28,320
-Medorrhinum is not in the rubric ailments from fright.

284
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:33,180
-Yes. You can ignore that.

285
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:54,750
-Like Staphysagria where you see the emotions are too powerful.

286
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:58,850
-Yes, too strong for Staphysagria.

287
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,750
The first information she gives is better joy...

288
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:24,100
I could see a real connection between emotions and the pathology that was going on.

289
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:29,850
And I wanted a remedy which has that in essence.

290
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:42,590
I thought I had described to you quite clearly the essence of Medorrhinum

291
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:44,670
and that you would be able to spot it.

292
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:48,410
Of course in another case when you see it now, you may remember it better

293
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:51,510
because you met the problem.

294
00:42:57,050 --> 00:43:04,760
Somebody wants to talk? Is anybody who does not understand why this is Medorrhinum?

295
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:16,270
Of course you said it before because otherwise you would have found it.

296
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:27,960
-The emotions are very strong, I was wondering if they are too strong to be inhibited.

297
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:35,590
-Exactly that's the idea. It's impulsive, she cannot inhibit.

298
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:48,190
Argentum nitricum lets it out.

299
00:43:54,690 --> 00:44:07,100
It's not inhibition there, it's a restriction on the reaction.

300
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:11,960
That's inhibition, it's instinctive.

301
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:16,590
She does not think I must not say that because it's no good,

302
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:20,080
it's not right, they will criticize me.

303
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:24,180
It's an instinct which is there, she cannot handle it.

304
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:30,840
It's a very alive person, with very alive emotions. It's not dead.

305
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:35,030
Staphysagria is much more dull.

306
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:45,920
Everything was inside but cannot be expressed and embarrassment all the time

307
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:49,600
and concern about others.

308
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:54,760
-Lachesis?

309
00:44:54,860 --> 00:45:02,180
-I said we cannot say that this is a description of Lachesis.

310
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:16,600
You know the other type of Lachesis I've spoken about? It's not that.

311
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:30,610
The other type of Lachesis is quite a lot of spite, malicious.

312
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:49,600
She wants to bite but she is compulsive. I'll give you an example.

313
00:45:50,350 --> 00:46:00,170
I go in the street and the man has the child, the woman goes back.

314
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:06,770
She says give me the child because you don't protect it enough.

315
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:14,250
She takes the child and she goes and a few meters after the child falls down

316
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:21,080
and then Lachesis what will do?

317
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:29,590
It will put the whole responsibility on the husband.

318
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:36,840
You see I told you, you made me cross and that's why the child fell down.

319
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:45,190
So it's your fault. You have done it. It's always your fault.

320
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:51,090
It's you that you have done something and I have not done it.

321
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:59,190
She will not express jealousy, that other type.

322
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:08,170
There are two couples. One is the doctor and his wife, the other is the engineer

323
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:10,670
and his wife and they go together.

324
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:15,510
Then the doctor who knows them a lot and knows that the thyroid of the woman

325
00:47:15,610 --> 00:47:25,590
of the engineer is having trouble, he says how is your thyroid, just out of curiosity

326
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:31,420
and friendliness and interest.

327
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:39,420
The Lachesis woman will observe that. She won't say a thing.

328
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:49,250
She will go back and she will think of it and she will say he definitely showed

329
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:54,440
much more interest than he should have done.

330
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,840
And then she will not say why did you show...?

331
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:22,340
But she will not say it exactly, she will say something to the effect that you paid

332
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:33,940
perhaps too much attention to her and this may have been interpreted by her husband.

333
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:45,040
It's not me that I'm jealous, force the fault to somebody else.

334
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:55,940
No, no, no I know you are talking...

335
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:06,340
The husband with the mother in law in the house and they talk and he communicates

336
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:14,110
naturally with her also and she would think that she is left out

337
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:20,610
and the husband is giving more attention to the mother in law or to his mother

338
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:23,110
than he is giving to her.

339
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:31,060
In a certain break of nervousness she will say something malicious to him

340
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:45,630
and then underneath that she would reveal that she had been put aside,

341
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:48,360
in the husband understanding.

342
00:49:48,460 --> 00:50:01,520
This type is much more disciplined in her reaction than the other one.

343
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:11,530
Then you see the man he is at a certain job but he is jealous of the others

344
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:14,360
having a better job than he has.

345
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:23,020
What he will do is he will moan like I did not have the possibility to study like him

346
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:28,620
and much more possibilities were giving to him and this thing will eat him up

347
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:34,460
constantly all these thoughts. He will never say I'm jealous.

348
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:43,320
This is quite disguised in the second type and it's presented as a very disciplined

349
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:54,530
and very orderly person but emotions are rising to the extend

350
00:50:54,630 --> 00:51:01,810
that they give rise to thoughts, which are completely if you analyse them deeper,

351
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:11,460
they are of the type of jealousy. But you will not see them in the beginning at all.

352
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:31,960
The desire for chicken also...

353
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:54,210
She came two months later to see me again, I have not written down the exact date.

354
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:13,630
This report is 8 months afterwards.

355
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:49,800
She said that she had an aggravation for 10 days and after that started amelioration.

356
00:52:53,710 --> 00:53:01,130
The itching during the aggravation was much increased.

357
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:07,210
If you remember there was no itching apart from the first days. Now she had itching.

358
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:24,460
Then she describes it as an intense calm inside after the aggravation, joy.

359
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:31,460
The words she used often is 'psyhremia'.

360
00:53:41,470 --> 00:53:50,710
It is interesting because she described exactly the coming down of that intensity.

361
00:53:51,720 --> 00:54:03,050
She said joy and intense calmness and the clearness of the mind.

362
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:11,460
Previously she thought she was overtaken by a situation. Now she is cool.

363
00:54:12,970 --> 00:54:18,870
It took away that condition, that inside intensity of the emotions

364
00:54:18,970 --> 00:54:24,290
which she will not describe it. She will not say I have emotions.

365
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:26,530
She could not describe anything of what was going on.

366
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:33,280
What she said was that when I'm joyfull it's gone, when I'm in grief it's...

367
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:37,530
That was an observation but actually the same observation was not there.

368
00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:39,280
She would not give me that.

369
00:54:42,890 --> 00:54:46,380
What you had is to feel and understand what is going on inside.

370
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:53,030
But I give you a hint that they may give you to understand the inside of what is going on.

371
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:06,030
She confirmed it later on by giving the natural state, the healing state of things.

372
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:11,880
And she said you were right when you evaluated that situation in me.

373
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:17,740
I heard what she is saying by the description because I didn't tell her evaluation

374
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,300
and all that.

375
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:30,690
After that it started a period where she says sometimes I will go down and then up again.

376
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:36,300
Then going down and up but on the whole she was quite OK.

377
00:55:37,090 --> 00:55:50,280
She had no tachycardia. Lately she says that she has some stitches in the heart

378
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:55,130
but if she lies down, immediately they go away.

379
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:07,380
She says that she started to see dreams of a nightmare style.

380
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:15,230
Sleeps on back now. The position of sleep which is on abdomen with Medorrhinum,

381
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:20,800
for Medorrhinum is normal to the back or to the sides.

382
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:27,790
No claustrophobia at all. She can enter a lift, she can go anywhere.

383
00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:40,890
She said that is gone completely. No desire for chicken.

384
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:49,120
She eats the chicken but there is no special desire.

385
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:53,470
It was very accentuated in the first meeting.

386
00:56:58,970 --> 00:57:05,470
And lately she says I've started biting my nails again.

387
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:24,970
So she has some ups and downs, bites her nails again. What shall we do?

388
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:27,480
-Wait.

389
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:37,470
-We can't wait, she comes from Thessaloniki very far and I have to make a decision.

390
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:38,970
-Stramonium.

391
00:57:39,070 --> 00:57:55,480
-Stramonium?
No problem.

392
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:06,560
The symptoms in the skin, she says sometimes up, sometimes down.

393
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:12,650
But it seems it starts to appear and disappear.

394
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:23,560
You must remember that the whole body is covered with that situation and the head.

395
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:29,660
It has cleared up and then after a while it started coming up and down.

396
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:40,890
In the meantime she said I had this aggravation and I said wait, wait, wait.

397
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:45,930
Then wait, wait by the phone, she decided to come and see me.

398
00:58:46,030 --> 00:58:50,670
By the time she comes to see me, I said continue it's all right.

399
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:55,560
Then it goes away, then it comes back.

400
00:58:55,660 --> 00:59:05,060
That is the situation when she comes to see me and what did I do?

401
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:16,770
-Placebo.

402
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:22,180
-Generally she is better, mentally she is better...

403
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:31,530
All that is left is some fluctuations. In that phase I would not give her a remedy.

404
00:59:39,490 --> 00:59:42,020
-Of course the prescription here is placebo.

405
00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:49,740
Now she comes 3 years later on 8th of February 1980.

406
01:00:03,490 --> 01:00:15,740
And now she is in a crisis, that means it's broken out the eruption.

407
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:26,050
Before that breaking out there was an allergic condition which came up.

408
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:32,380
She has eaten something, she did not know, there was an allergic condition went away

409
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:35,690
and the eruption broke out again.

410
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:46,890
It has intense itching now and the itching is worse in the afternoon.

411
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:55,050
It's interesting that the heart is still working OK, tachycardia has gone

412
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:59,890
and claustrophobia still remains.

413
01:01:02,650 --> 01:01:11,800
Desire for chicken did not come back again, the desire for sweets is more

414
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:20,140
and the thirst is more. What has increased is the desire for orange juice.

415
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:26,900
Sweets and orange juice have increased in desire.

416
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:41,490
Now she dreams and many times she sees sweets in her dreams.

417
01:01:53,730 --> 01:02:04,990
Biting of the nails is quite strong again and no other information.

418
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:16,240
1980 as we said, 8th of February. What did I do? What would you do?

419
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:30,380
200. You remember I wrote 2 remedies before Medorrhinum

420
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,730
and then I wrote Medorrhinum.

421
01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:40,720
In this case I would have given 1M if it was a very clear cut case of Medorrhinum.

422
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:44,820
But that's not a very clear cut case of Medorrhinum.

423
01:02:45,570 --> 01:02:51,720
So I gave 200. That was a small potency.

424
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:54,820
Now what did I do?

425
01:02:55,320 --> 01:03:01,720
-1M.
-10M.

426
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:05,720
-I'm going to change the remedy because there are changes in the chicken,

427
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:10,630
claustrophobia and tachycardia?
-No.

428
01:03:10,730 --> 01:03:16,640
-No. The constitutional symptoms which had come up more, desire for sweets

429
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:20,640
and desire for oranges are covered by the same previous remedy?

430
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:22,740
-Yes.
-They are covered.

431
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:30,300
Then the biting of the nails is characteristic of Medorrhinum as we saw.

432
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:35,320
Medorrhinum has helped her. She is in a relapse.

433
01:03:37,570 --> 01:03:43,060
The itching is in the afternoon but it's not in the evening.

434
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:57,850
So I gave a dose of Medorrhinum 1M and she has not bothered me since then.

435
01:03:59,830 --> 01:04:05,220
She used to telephone quite a lot when we had started.

436
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:15,720
When she was reassured, it took her 2 years before she came down.

437
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:21,970
I told her, I explained to her that you might have a real relapse

438
01:04:22,070 --> 01:04:27,220
and you still wait for 15-20 days, one month before you see the relapse

439
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:34,800
it is really established that you come down again. And that was the case.

440
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:44,970
With that case we had 3 years going by from Medorrhinum 200 with a good reaction.

441
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:52,640
When the remedy is correct, you don't expect within 2-3 months to come back.

442
01:04:52,740 --> 01:05:02,980
Also I would even say that 3 years is not a big time.

443
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:14,230
Some antidotal influences most probably have been on her to bring it back.

444
01:05:15,490 --> 01:05:28,990
We've seen cases that after 5, after 6, after 10 years we see them again.

445
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:35,980
That means they remained well, in spite of antidotal influences.

446
01:05:36,230 --> 01:05:42,130
This is the effect that we have when we find the correct remedy.

447
01:05:55,070 --> 01:05:57,900
I'll tell you something about psoriasis.

448
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:08,880
From 5-6 years onwards to 10, 20 years psoriasis is a very difficult situation to treat.

449
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:20,050
If they come within the first 6 months, I found out that success is 100%.

450
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:23,640
Once you find the remedy is 100% success.

451
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:30,720
But if they have a lot of years behind their back with the psoriasis,

452
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:33,300
it becomes much more difficult.

453
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:40,140
I treated a case of generalized psoriasis, which was for about 10 years.

454
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:46,810
I treated for 5 years before I could make the skin tolerably well

455
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:51,310
and yet the skin is with redness.

456
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:59,970
And I have seen that case with 25 years, they get better but to a certain extend.

457
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:02,150
They don't progress further.

458
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:09,310
This is a case where she had the eruption almost 6 years.

459
01:07:09,410 --> 01:07:18,160
But there is a difference here with the psoriasis, it is puncted.

460
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:28,080
This kind of psoriasis, in Greek is called puncted para-psoriasis.

461
01:07:29,070 --> 01:07:32,320
I don't know if that's the whole name in English also.

462
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:42,470
In Greek is 'stagonoides' para-psoriasis, this is the diagnosis.

463
01:07:42,570 --> 01:07:52,820
Have you got the English? Stagonoides para-psoriasis.

464
01:07:53,570 --> 01:08:00,320
What you said punctate para-psoriasis.

465
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:18,660
There are two types of psoriasis.

466
01:08:19,410 --> 01:08:28,810
The classical type which is more malignant than the para-psoriasis.

467
01:08:28,910 --> 01:08:34,050
This para-psoriasis looks like it but it has small...

468
01:08:34,150 --> 01:08:40,230
In psoriasis it becomes bigger and bigger and one spot can become within

469
01:08:40,330 --> 01:08:41,740
25 years as big as that one.

470
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:48,380
It becomes a whole redness which has started from a spot like that

471
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:57,130
and then the thickness of the skin is quite thick and it falls out in big pieces.

472
01:08:57,230 --> 01:09:04,890
In para-psoriasis it remains to that size and the scale

473
01:09:04,990 --> 01:09:11,070
which is formed is much more thinner.

474
01:09:11,570 --> 01:09:31,070
Also you don't have the cracks and the fissures that trigger in psoriasis proper.

475
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:47,560
They respond quickly, they don't go towards cure.

476
01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:51,560
They respond quickly usually with a big reaction.

477
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:55,740
That means flare up of the situation.

478
01:09:57,750 --> 01:10:02,250
Then it's gone up to a certain point and then they don't go further.

479
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:09,400
-Do you have any conjecture why psoriasis was the disease?

480
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:19,250
-Psoriasis is of an unknown origin and they classify it usually with the collagen diseases.

481
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:31,480
All collagen diseases are supposed to be quite obstinate and quite persistent.

482
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:36,470
And all diseases like lupus erythematosus are also of the same type,

483
01:10:36,570 --> 01:10:45,410
of the same prognosis. Also rheumatoid arthritis.

484
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:52,910
What I said it holds good for all collagen diseases.

485
01:10:57,160 --> 01:11:08,400
But strangely enough you have a condition the sarcoidosis.

486
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:19,260
That is supposed to be a more serious condition than lupus erythematosus.

487
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,740
How you identify?

488
01:11:33,010 --> 01:11:35,310
How you say the intensity between these two diseases are?

489
01:11:35,410 --> 01:11:37,490
What would you say?

490
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:46,910
Sarcoidosis verse lupus. Which is more great as a prognosis?

491
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:09,300
-I would say sarcoid is an equivalent. They are equivalent to each other.

492
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:14,300
-But for us, for treating cases of sarcoidosis I found out

493
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:20,650
that it is more easily manageable than lupus.

494
01:12:26,410 --> 01:12:32,650
-...Can you probably say that they are not going to jump up to another level of health?

495
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:40,900
-Most probably in other words we can say that. They are not going to.

496
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,220
One more observation.

497
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:50,810
The same observation will apply for multiple sclerosis.

498
01:12:53,810 --> 01:13:00,800
Multiple sclerosis will form a plaque and this will give out symptoms

499
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:03,550
which will be permanent.

500
01:13:03,650 --> 01:13:10,710
Around the plaques there is an edema which causes the symptoms to appear and disappear,

501
01:13:10,810 --> 01:13:12,920
when the edema goes away.

502
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:16,880
That's why it has a kind of recurrency.

503
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:22,390
When you treat homeopathically, you take away the edema

504
01:13:22,490 --> 01:13:29,880
and the tendency to form edemas and plaques but what is before your treatment,

505
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:36,130
what damage is done before your treatment is going to be left there.

506
01:13:36,230 --> 01:13:39,970
Do not expect that this will go away.

507
01:13:40,070 --> 01:13:49,480
Therefore if you catch these cases very early in their development you have 100 % cures.

508
01:13:49,580 --> 01:13:55,220
But if you let it develop within 2-3 years, the plaques becomes more and more

509
01:13:55,320 --> 01:14:04,060
then the permanent damage will be left in spite of your treatment.

510
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:16,960
-Are you saying within the first year they are diagnosed or...

511
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:24,230
Because many people have for 2-3 years strange symptoms.

512
01:14:24,330 --> 01:14:30,830
-That is a problem in diagnosis.

513
01:14:33,570 --> 01:14:42,320
Mulptiple sclerosis may appear, the first signs might be of very different type.

514
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:54,970
It can appear as diplopia, it can appear as post bulbar neuritis as numbness in different parts,

515
01:14:55,070 --> 01:15:09,480
as a difficulty, as a weakness on the extremities. It may have a lot of forms.

516
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:16,150
But there is a recurrence and you will see it after 6 months again.

517
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:23,640
With a similar episode and then it starts the numbness, the weakness.

518
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:30,340
At that stage are manageable and they are many cases

519
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:32,990
that they were diagnosed already.

520
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:38,640
I believe that if we had better diagnosis for multiple sclerosis,

521
01:15:38,740 --> 01:15:46,240
we may be able to establish better our results.

522
01:15:49,740 --> 01:15:57,880
-I wonder if this is same. I have a case of generalized psoriasis 15-20 years, very severe...

523
01:16:08,690 --> 01:16:16,590
Now much better energy, the skin is exactly the same but it has an aggravation

524
01:16:16,690 --> 01:16:21,100
the first week. I asked him what it was. An extreme pain.

525
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:30,720
But there was no change in the skin but since it was so much better

526
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:37,150
we didn't do anything but I wonder why the skin didn't change.

527
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:46,590
-Most probably. 20 years of psoriasis you don't expect much changes.

528
01:16:46,690 --> 01:16:52,870
Actually we have battled with such cases and what I tell you now

529
01:16:52,970 --> 01:16:56,630
is my experience of the last years and what you came down

530
01:16:56,730 --> 01:16:59,480
to know after many years of battling.

531
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:07,810
In the beginning we battled with this and you try to do something really.

532
01:17:07,910 --> 01:17:11,910
What you see is aggravations, ameliorations up to a certain extend

533
01:17:12,010 --> 01:17:13,920
and then it stays there.

534
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:18,410
There is one more point to remember, that if you make mistakes with these cases,

535
01:17:18,510 --> 01:17:23,490
later on you may bring back the whole situation as it was in the beginning.

536
01:17:23,590 --> 01:17:31,570
After 2-3 years of treatment while the person is ameliorated to quite a good point

537
01:17:31,670 --> 01:17:34,920
but not happy, not satisfied because the thing is not gone,

538
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:37,930
you try more and more and then you make mistakes.

539
01:17:38,030 --> 01:17:42,670
One day you see the whole thing flares all over again and you say my god.

540
01:17:42,770 --> 01:17:48,260
Then they get disappointed and they may leave you.

541
01:17:50,770 --> 01:17:55,160
This is lack of knowledge of Theory, of what we can do.

542
01:17:55,260 --> 01:18:02,410
In our books unfortunately nobody else spoke clearly about these things.

543
01:18:02,510 --> 01:18:09,170
You get cases in literature. A scyzophrenia case is cured, an epilepsy case is cured,

544
01:18:09,270 --> 01:18:19,270
a multiple sclerosis is cured but nobody spoke the truth, his experience.

545
01:18:20,010 --> 01:18:26,240
And I tell you just to see the possibilities that exist with Homeopathy,

546
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:28,590
I'll give you an idea.

547
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:40,660
They brought me on 1968 a case of multiple sclerosis

548
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:48,020
which has been going on for the last 10 years. I did not know that at that time.

549
01:18:48,510 --> 01:18:53,160
I prescribed. They stopped the cortisone.

550
01:18:53,260 --> 01:19:02,170
She was walking with the cortisone, cut down the cortisone, in bed, paralyzed.

551
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:06,410
Once you cut down the cortisone in such heavy cases,

552
01:19:06,510 --> 01:19:10,760
 they lie in bed, paralysed completely.

553
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:19,910
I tried a treatment for 3 months but she was in bed constantly.

554
01:19:20,010 --> 01:19:29,920
With cortisone she was walking. Without treatment she stayed in bed for 2,5 months.

555
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:36,160
I expected that I may have treated more and more and find what was the next remedy

556
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:41,270
but she had no patience to wait and she went back to cortisone.

557
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:50,910
She took some Russian remedies they give with snakes and some Bulgarian remedies

558
01:19:51,010 --> 01:19:59,420
and on 1979, about 10 years later, they called me again to see the case.

559
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:02,020
But the case was in the last stage.

560
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:15,240
The medulla oblongata was affected, she had difficulty in swallowing,

561
01:20:15,340 --> 01:20:20,920
difficulty in the heart, difficulty... That is the last stage that they get choked

562
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:23,020
and they die.

563
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:38,320
She was in bed now, for the last one year she was permanently in a chair.

564
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:46,070
Hands affected, all extremities were affected, heart was affected...

565
01:20:46,170 --> 01:20:52,070
They called me and they said we decided finally to give up cortisone

566
01:20:52,170 --> 01:20:56,930
and rely on the treatment completely.

567
01:21:07,010 --> 01:21:12,590
They knew she was going to die.

568
01:21:14,590 --> 01:21:30,840
I said Ok since she stopped the cortisone... that was the end of the cortisone.

569
01:21:31,550 --> 01:21:36,840
I went to see her and I prescribed for her a series of remedies.

570
01:21:46,590 --> 01:21:53,990
The symptoms of dyspnea, of not swallowing,

571
01:21:54,090 --> 01:21:59,350
of not being able to speak they all went away.

572
01:22:00,590 --> 01:22:09,090
She reached the point where she saw some signs of moving the big toe.

573
01:22:12,690 --> 01:22:16,090
She was better psychologically, better in everything.

574
01:22:21,690 --> 01:22:36,190
She was married to a young man at her age, that girl must be 35 years old.

575
01:22:37,270 --> 01:22:48,420
Since 12 years old she is suffering with the disease and she became pregnant.

576
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:55,480
That becoming pregnant was after the second homeopathic treatment.

577
01:22:56,940 --> 01:23:01,960
Then one day they telephoned me and said she is pregnant, what we should do?

578
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:07,940
I say my god, you have a big problem.

579
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:20,920
I said ask the gynecologist whom she was attending and ask what are the prognosis

580
01:23:21,020 --> 01:23:24,160
and whether she should keep it. And if he says yes, keep it.

581
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:27,770
And he said yes.

582
01:23:39,770 --> 01:23:44,270
This girl now has a child of 1,5 years old.

583
01:23:48,270 --> 01:23:50,920
I'm not attending the child, some other doctor is attending.

584
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:59,590
I believe that being under homeopathic treatment we escape a lot of suffering

585
01:23:59,690 --> 01:24:07,340
but the interesting thing is that this girl from 1979, we have 1983,

586
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:15,700
she goes now with her life. I consider that she would have died within a few months.

587
01:24:21,690 --> 01:24:27,340
We just saved her from the last stage of the disease.

588
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:32,270
She was able to cope with the labor.

589
01:24:33,010 --> 01:24:38,670
The heart was almost a heart failure during the labor time

590
01:24:38,770 --> 01:24:46,270
and we kept on prescribing for her.

591
01:24:47,310 --> 01:24:54,720
That is to give you an idea of how we cure multiple sclerosis

592
01:24:54,820 --> 01:24:58,770
but we have to be quite accurate when we talk.

593
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:07,450
To know what we propose because some day they are going to ask us to do

594
01:25:07,550 --> 01:25:10,710
double blind test for Homeopathy.

595
01:25:10,810 --> 01:25:16,060
So we know what we can do and not claim what we cannot believe.
