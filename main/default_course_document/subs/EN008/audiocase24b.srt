1
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:22,870
-Your feet are better warm or cold?

2
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:28,310
-They are freezing always.

3
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,930
-Do you like milk?

4
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:41,140
-I like it with cookies and something sweet but

5
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:49,980
 I don't just drink it usually unless I have something sweet.

6
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:58,980
It's hard to say, it's both the tiredness and the pain together.

7
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:07,980
The last 5-6 months my menstrual cramps have got very bad again,

8
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,330
they were dramatically better after the last remedy that you gave me the Colocynthis,

9
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:18,100
they almost cleaned up for 4-5 months.

10
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,850
That is another thing. She was given Colocynthis and

11
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:25,540
the menstrual cramps got much better.

12
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:41,860
What Colocynthis did?
It affected the person only on local aspect.

13
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:51,090
What you are aiming at this person is with your remedy to go very deep and

14
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:59,340
change the mental-emotional structure that has been crystallized for years.

15
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,840
You are aiming at changing the structure,
you don't care about the pains.

16
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:09,600
What you care is about the psychopathology which is there and

17
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:16,180
to see that this has been touched ,this untouchable situation.

18
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:22,150
Nothing can reach her to touch her, it has to break up, it has to break up.

19
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:26,090
Something is happening to that girl that she is crystallized almost.

20
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:32,550
You feel an element of crystallization is there, she is going to become a mummy,

21
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:39,540
she is going to develop the Raynaud's syndrome very soon.

22
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:47,130
This is the idea of Raynaud, the crystallization, the vessels lose their elasticity,

23
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:50,470
their possibility to carry the blood to the extremities and

24
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:56,720
the person dies from the extremities onwards in the physical body.

25
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:02,910
That is the idea of Raynaud's syndrome.

26
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:11,000
She is going to get it and then she will become arteriosclerotic completely.

27
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:16,240
Your remedy is not the menstrual cramps, you gave a remedy and

28
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,580
the menstrual cramps are better, thank you very much.

29
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:26,580
If you see it like that and then you see the same situation, you have done nothing.

30
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,420
That's why we have to learn to understand when the remedy is acting correctly and

31
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:38,750
deeply and when the remedy is acting superficially and affecting only little parts,

32
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,000
especially of the physical body.

33
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:47,870
That's why we can't say Homeopathy is this way or that way and

34
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:52,610
we can give 10-15 remedies and why you are fighting. We are not fighting.

35
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:57,910
We try to show that this kind of Homeopathy is much more rewarding first for

36
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,450
the patient and then for the practitioner.

37
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:05,250
Because you will see she will come and say nothing.

38
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:13,330
Nothing, no change, the pains are even worse.

39
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,580
Then I said now wait.

40
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,820
I received a telephone call just before I left Greece in May from America,

41
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,750
she said she has been without pains and

42
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:29,500
the pains have started to return after 6 or 7 months from the prescription of the remedy.

43
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,810
But you will see the follow up here and

44
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:38,560
you will see what happens. I'm sure you don't want to see any more of this case...

45
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:44,150
Later on I will ask you about the avarice element, can you go just to the end because

46
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:55,150
it is towards the end of the case, where I asked her about how careful she is with her money.

47
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:59,900
And you will see the answer how it comes. She says I'm very careful, I have to

48
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:12,400
calculate  every bit of money I spent and then I found a rubric which is very interesting.

49
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:22,340
Desires more things than he has, look at the page 35.

50
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:29,320
-It seems to me that you had some experiences in your life that have affected you very much and

51
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:38,150
you made some concrete beliefs in you, certain things you decided this is so.

52
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,160
-That is probably true.

53
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:51,910
-These experiences were very deep and very hurting but not overt, they were very subtle.

54
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:55,150
-You mean something that I'm not even aware?

55
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,400
-No, you are aware.

56
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:02,740
What I explained to her here that most probably you have some very painful experiences,

57
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:09,070
that made you feel that...

58
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:12,910
There is no love, there is no affection, there is no friendship,

59
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:16,240
some concrete conclusions she came about

60
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:28,250
and she has crystallized but to break through that it's very difficult.

61
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:37,730
There is a point where she talks about her avarice element,

62
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,180
 this difficulty in spending the money.

63
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:55,990
-When did you take the remedy?

64
00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:00,960
-Two weeks ago on Monday. Two weeks plus three days.

65
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:08,460
-It is 18 days. How do you feel it?

66
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:16,300
-I didn't get my sleep at all but yesterday I felt terrible. I felt like...

67
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:28,710
-I don't want to hear about on day, I want to hear in general.

68
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:32,970
Since you took the remedy what is the situation?

69
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:37,460
-It's been bad, physically terrible.

70
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,960
-You mean you felt worse.

71
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,550
-Yes.

72
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:46,300
-With the exception of today?

73
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,630
-Yes today I don't feel too bad but the other days very bad,

74
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:57,790
18 days that I didn't feel really terrible but most of the time I was pretty bad.

75
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:00,830
-How was the next day after you took the remedy?

76
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:06,050
-I think I felt pretty good.

77
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:11,300
-After the remedy. You felt exceptionally good?

78
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:20,880
-No, I think no difference from before I take the remedy and then

79
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,460
 in a few days I started to feel worse.

80
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,720
-You felt that the remedy has done nothing?

81
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:33,510
-I may be having a reaction because I feel a little worse since I took it.

82
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,510
-In what respect?

83
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,290
-More pain.

84
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:40,920
-Where are your pains?

85
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:49,170
-My arms and hands, especially in my shoulders, the upper body but

86
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:52,170
 especially in my head and my hands and arms.

87
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:55,260
-When you say head what do you mean?

88
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,500
-Sometimes I have a headache but it's all over my scalp but

89
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:06,010
I'm talking mainly about the pain which is in here behind my nose,

90
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:14,210
sore throat and my eyelids were very sore,

91
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:18,180
they felt like burning sensation.

92
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:29,260
-Out of these pains which are the most prominent?

93
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,090
-This pain around my eyes and behind my nose.

94
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:46,260
What really bothers me is the pain in my head.

95
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,260
-How was the insomnia?

96
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,590
What do you think so far?

97
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:58,130
-She has more grief?

98
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:07,930
-Who can tell me exactly? You see there is more grief, there is a change but

99
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:12,010
somebody else to define it differently??

100
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:19,430
-She is breaking down.

101
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:29,180
-More angry.

102
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:36,600
-She is exhausted.

103
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,170
-She is not so smooth.

104
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:44,350
-The face, yes.

105
00:10:47,550 --> 00:11:01,060
Let us say she looks more tired and more old, isn't it an element of that?

106
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:08,330
As if she has aged too fast.

107
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:22,330
He says her hair is different. It is not. Actually it is exactly the same,

108
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:29,820
only the 3/4 here instead of lying here she has changed the style and put it over there.

109
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:42,910
This is the difference. Still her dress is very meticulous.

110
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:51,500
I know Americans they don't care about dress really.

111
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,580
For her being an American to be dressed in this way, old fashioned almost,

112
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:03,670
this is an old fashioned dressing for an American to be dressed at this moment.

113
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:09,410
It is typical of Arsenicum.

114
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:22,160
Now there are a few things we have to evaluate. She says I'm a little bit worse.

115
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:33,250
Can we take it as an aggravation? We can take it as an aggravation but there is one but.

116
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:38,160
If we take it as an aggravation on the physical level,

117
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:45,160
we have to see a similar amelioration on the mental-emotional level before

118
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,420
we can pronounce and say this is an aggravation.

119
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:56,170
If we don't see that the aggravation is undefined, it is not really strong to persuade and

120
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:59,990
to say this is really and aggravation.

121
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:05,540
So what I would like to see is an amelioration somewhere on the emotional side.

122
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:10,690
I can see this aging there. Something has happened. Some experience took place that

123
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:17,580
made her more alive, coming into contact. She was not into contact with life.

124
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:23,180
She gave me the impression that she was not in contact with real life,

125
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:31,670
she was just living in a world on her own, with her pains, limitations, misery, tragedies...

126
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:51,920
Now if she wakes up to the real world, she is 34... How old is she?

127
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:57,170
She is looking too young for her age.

128
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:12,910
When she wakes up and comes in contact with the world, she is going to age very fast.

129
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:16,420
This is one thing you will see with your mental cases.

130
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:25,410
The mental cases do not usually have the wrinkles or the signs in the face of the

131
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:30,420
experience in life because experience in life has gone over them.

132
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:39,700
Once you bring them back to real life, you see the lines in the face become prominent and

133
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,930
you see life going on.

134
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:45,420
If you look in the face of everybody of you, you will see the lines,

135
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,030
you will see the experiences of life and

136
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:52,040
that is why you can say you have been through this,

137
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:56,600
you have been through that, you have been through that...

138
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,030
Because you see the lines in the face and

139
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:03,080
something tells you a story because of the experience.

140
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:09,120
In mental cases you will see unbroken faces.

141
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,410
And you give the remedy and the remedy brings back the life,

142
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:19,420
as if the memory of the experiences is depicted upon the face and

143
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,160
the face becomes really expressive and

144
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:30,920
gives the experiences of life then.

145
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:41,670
This case I try to find out how much better she might have been emotionally or mentally.

146
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:49,500
Is she better? What happened inside in the very deep part of her.

147
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,500
I want to find out what is happening and she still has this attitude,

148
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,590
this unexpressive attitude that you cannot penetrate.

149
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:05,080
I'm going to be a little bit aggressive with her and you will see it,

150
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:08,420
because what I want to know is whether the remedy has acted.

151
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:13,670
Until now I'm not convinced that the remedy is acting.

152
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:25,430
I see a kind of aggravation but can I take it as an aggravation? I'm not sure at all.

153
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:42,250
-I wasn't too bad and then towards the end of this past week I got really bad and

154
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:47,510
I went to sleep at 4 o'clock in the morning for a number of days.

155
00:16:50,980 --> 00:17:00,840
I took some pills, I lost my will power, they have antihistamine,

156
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:04,090
so they helped me sleeping. So for a couple of days I took that.

157
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,670
-This last night? For 2-3 nights?

158
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:12,460
-Yes for 3 nights.

159
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:17,500
-The previous nights you had been sleeping tolerably well?

160
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:25,370
-Before these 3 nights it has been about 4 nights that I haven't got to sleep but

161
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:35,520
at four o'clock in the morning and I got the feeling that I couldn't handle it anymore.

162
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:41,610
-How much of these pills you took?

163
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:44,600
-Two each night.

164
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:49,440
-And they are made especially for sleep or you made them yourself?

165
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:59,940
-No, it is for pain and I know that there is one other ingredient which is antihistamine and

166
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:06,780
it makes you sleepy.

167
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:18,930
-How was your psychological state during this time?

168
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:27,010
-Not bad most of the time, not as bad as the physical pain but as I said yesterday and

169
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:33,370
the day before I've been through really terrible psychological...

170
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:43,270
-The fact that you are feeling better psychologically and in yourself did not prevent you

171
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:46,850
from taking these other drugs, so you don't spoil the treatment?

172
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:49,680
-No.

173
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,850
-Because after you took it, you saw immediately the effect,

174
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:55,770
after you took it the last 2-3 days you are feeling rotten again psychologically.

175
00:18:55,870 --> 00:19:02,350
-That is true but I don't really know.

176
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:06,350
-You didn't connect it. You take it every day the remedy?

177
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:21,190
-No, I just took two doses in one day. Just in one day.

178
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,020
-That's all.

179
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:35,850
So if I understand well your sleep was improved and

180
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:42,350
your psychological state was improved for 10-12 days and

181
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:45,350
after that because you couldn't sleep for 2-3 days,

182
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:55,680
you started taking again the antihistamine and then the pains were worse from the third day?

183
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:59,440
-I can't really say that the pains are any worse now.

184
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:05,180
-Yes but after the Tylenol the pains went back to the normal?

185
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:15,870
-I don't think so. I don't think that they are any worse for two weeks.

186
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,270
-No they are better.

187
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:29,270
You say now for a few days the pains are better where before they were stronger.

188
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,260
That is what you said, if you play back.

189
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,010
-That's what you said, the last few days you are feeling a little better but before that

190
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,340
it was terrible.

191
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,930
-About the pains.

192
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,290
-No I said today.

193
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:50,340
-Just today it's better.

194
00:20:52,690 --> 00:21:04,090
-Several days before today I felt very bad physically and emotionally but

195
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:06,670
I don't think I felt worse physically,

196
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:13,520
I think I only felt worse emotionally the last couple days.

197
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:19,040
-What I say is that the couple few days you felt worse emotionally but

198
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,250
 you felt better physically.

199
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:27,300
That means the pains the last 2-3 days are not as severe now as

200
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,830
they were 10-15 days ago.

201
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:34,050
-I'm not really sure.

202
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:40,050
-You are not sure because this is what you have been implying before.

203
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:47,300
-I'm sorry I'm confused. I don't remember what I said but it seems to me ...

204
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:54,300
You see the moment I try to get the facts there is an element in her that

205
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,160
she does not want to give the facts.

206
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:02,220
What she wants to say is that I'm worse and there is no problem and

207
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:08,220
no matter how I try to put into order the facts,

208
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,710
what really happened, she will not give the facts.

209
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:19,240
Either because she is not in the mental position to give the facts or

210
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:28,500
because there is a sub-conscious element of what? Can anybody tell me?

211
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,970
-Resistance.

212
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:39,300
-Resistance, there is a subconscious element of resistance. You don't feel it?

213
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:45,550
Your treatment has done nothing.

214
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:53,130
What she implied so far is that the first few days she felt good,

215
00:22:53,230 --> 00:23:02,220
she slept but the pains started being more and

216
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,470
then because her sleep was disturbed and

217
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:12,050
the pains were strong she took Tylenol and the other thing.

218
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:23,550
The pains went down after Tylenol and now she felt bad psychologically again.

219
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:32,640
I tried to make sure that these facts are so and she will not confirm it.

220
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:39,380
What I perceive is that there is a resistance.

221
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:53,390
You have to be very aware of subtle things happening because in this particular case,

222
00:23:53,490 --> 00:24:02,380
you realize that this person has crystallized, has taken a position in life that says,

223
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,970
here I am.

224
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:07,470
She has put her back on the wall and
says here I am.

225
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,720
You come to break down all this position, this philosophy,

226
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:26,130
whatever has brought this kind of attitude, you come to break it down and

227
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,370
you have to do it fast because the students in the class are waiting for you to make a mistake.

228
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:35,420
They say that is the wrong medicine, give another medicine.

229
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:42,120
I have to really find out did I give the wrong medicine? Is it the wrong medicine or

230
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:49,590
do I have to wait? Because if I make a mistake, the mistake will show later on.

231
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:59,080
So I'm very attentive of what I'm perceiving here. I'm perceiving a resistance.

232
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:04,340
And I say to myself now why this resistance? What she wants?

233
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:09,590
And then it clicks in my mind. This is what is happening and

234
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:16,170
you will hear what is happening.

235
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:22,420
-Physical pain has been pretty persistent throughout the 18 days. It's been the same.

236
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:26,680
-But you said it was worse.

237
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,160
-After I took the remedy?

238
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:32,000
-Yes, the pains were worse than before.

239
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,260
-Yes.

240
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,840
-Did you say that?

241
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,170
-Yes.

242
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:41,670
-The last three days are worse or as before?

243
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:47,420
-Oh, a little bit worse than before.

244
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,450
-But now it is worse than 10 days ago?

245
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:56,170
-I really don't remember how much better it was.

246
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:59,920
-The thing is that you stopped the action of the remedy by taking Tylenol.

247
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:12,260
-Really? I don't have much will power when it gets...

248
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:16,830
You see what she says here is I don't have much will power, so I took the Tylenol.

249
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:22,160
She has much will power as long as she feels things are going to be staying as

250
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:27,750
they are and suddenly she loses her will power and she takes the Tylenol.

251
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:30,250
She knows that if she takes another medicine because

252
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,500
she is under homeopathic treatment for the last 2-3 years,

253
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,840
if she takes another medicine she will spoil the treatment or will delay the treatment.

254
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,420
She knows that.

255
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:47,260
The third, fourth day of the treatment she goes and starts taking the medicine.

256
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:58,000
Again another point for me to confirm what I have been thinking about her.

257
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:04,250
What do you think it is happening? You will see.

258
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:09,250
-My will power is weak.

259
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:19,250
-By taking it you revert back the old pattern, that means less pains but insomnia strong,

260
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:25,200
psychologically bad, energy wise bad.

261
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:34,000
During the first 10 days, did you see any increase in your energy?

262
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,030
-No.

263
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:41,540
-If you don't speak honestly, we cannot help you.

264
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,340
-I know it exactly.

265
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,040
-You have to tell exactly and you have to realize that

266
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:53,080
you have to tell me exactly what happened before and after.

267
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:59,330
Before I was so much and now after the remedy I'm worse.

268
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:04,090
I don't care if you say I'm worse or I'm better, as long as you tell me the truth.

269
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:12,680
-I'm doing my best to remember exactly. I wouldn't try to mislead you.

270
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:17,670
-Because if you mislead me, there is no possibility that we will help you.

271
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:22,670
We rely completely on what you say, we don't have any measure whether

272
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:27,870
you tell the truth or you tell something to mislead us.

273
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:28,670
-I'm aware of that.

274
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:39,040
-Maybe out of your thoughts, you may think it is good if I say this or it is bad if I say that

275
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:46,830
and you intellectualize, you bring out the information, without giving the real information.

276
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:50,370
Yes the second day I was rotten, the third day I was much better...

277
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:58,870
I don't feel that coming from you. I feel that you think about it...

278
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:03,460
-I'm trying to remember, it's hard for me to remember.

279
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:09,460
-But you remember that you were worse. How do you remember when you were worse and

280
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:16,250
you remember you were better psychologically also.

281
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:25,000
-I think I was better psychologically. I'm very confused right now,

282
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,500
I can't remember whether I was or not.

283
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:34,420
What do you think it's happening inside her?

284
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,920
She says I'm very confused, I can't remember.

285
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:48,170
She actually imposes a kind of confusion upon her.

286
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:53,570
It is like somebody who is threatened.

287
00:29:53,670 --> 00:30:00,820
Now a resolution has come very close, so he imposes a kind of confusion,

288
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:05,820
so we don't know what is happening and we are out of the situation.

289
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:10,650
This is my impression.

290
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:20,620
Therefore what is the conclusion? What is the natural thing for me to think about her?

291
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:35,740
What am I thinking about her now? Given the facts that she wants,

292
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:40,940
she does not want to give me the facts.

293
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,520
-She is improving.

294
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:49,980
-She feels emotion at this moment more than before.

295
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:59,580
-She does not want to improve.

296
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:06,240
She gives me the impression that she does not want to get well.

297
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:17,320
I suddenly perceived that what she is having at this moment,

298
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:23,070
the government security she receives, the disability things,

299
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:34,570
the life that has been limited she doesn't want to change that, she is afraid to change that.

300
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:40,070
-She had these complains for a long time and there is a certain order and

301
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:43,820
when things are changing becoming in this order then

302
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,820
that fits to the Arsenicum type because then

303
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:53,770
she wants to bring them back to order.

304
00:31:53,870 --> 00:32:01,420
-Now she is confused.

305
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:07,820
-But these ideas are not strong enough for me to say, she is doing better.

306
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:17,320
Still she has confused me. Was she really better psychologically? I could not get it.

307
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:21,740
Is she really worse physically? I could not confirm it.

308
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:27,110
But what I perceive finally out of all this struggle between her and me to get the truth,

309
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:33,570
I perceive finally a resistance, she does not want to get well.

310
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:38,330
This realization comes to my mind, she does not want to change and

311
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:53,570
she feels now the change is too close and she resists. Now what shall I do if that is true?

312
00:32:53,670 --> 00:33:00,070
-Reassurance for a new situation.

313
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:10,850
-Would you say before that she was lifeless, now she is still secure with anxiety,

314
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:14,190
would you say she was better than what she would like to?

315
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:20,570
-I can't because they are not clear facts, I cannot rely, I cannot tell you she is doing better

316
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:25,570
because there is insecurity now and therefore she is better.

317
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:29,150
I can't say to the students things like that because

318
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:35,650
it is too much imagination put into the case. I would imagine a lot.

319
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:50,830
What I perceive is there is definitely a resistance of getting better. What shall I do?

320
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:55,670
Let us you came to the realization that she does not want to get better?

321
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:58,910
How you proceed?

322
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:05,520
-Tell her.

323
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:14,670
We have the interval and you will hear the continuation.

324
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:31,740
Desires, aversions you said mustard and also Arsenicum has desire for olive oil fat.

325
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:40,780
I've seen Arsenicum cases where they drink olive oil. It is so much the desire.

326
00:34:40,880 --> 00:35:01,330
Mustard also is there in your Repertory? Desire for olive oil you can add it as Arsenicum.

327
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:05,910
This was the situation we arrived.

328
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:17,670
As you saw, I could not make a decision whether the remedy had acted or not.

329
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:26,750
Then I realized that there is a resistance, so I'm thinking what shall I do?

330
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:33,370
But how to show it? You can't teach in the class and

331
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:39,620
say I think there is a resistance to treatment.
They will say we know all these excuses.

332
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:53,750
So I decided to put forward a question, to ask her straightaway to find out whether really

333
00:35:53,850 --> 00:36:02,740
she didn't want to get well. Was it in her conscious mind?

334
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,080
Is it something that she perceives already or

335
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:10,420
is it something she does completely unconsciously?

336
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:19,170
That is one thing that may be lead me to believe that perhaps Arsenicum still is acting,

337
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:22,290
it is the right remedy etc. and we shall not change it but

338
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:26,580
what I still wanted to perceive is an

339
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:31,580
opening up, a breaking out on deep emotional level.

340
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:42,340
I wanted to see a tangible fact that Arsenicum has really started breaking down that

341
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:47,910
crystallization, which we see here.

342
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:55,250
And don't forget that some of the student remark while I was outside that

343
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:59,580
all of us have crystallizations.

344
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:04,380
When you come to a seminar of that type with preconceived ideas with

345
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:10,830
what is right, is the same resistance.

346
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:19,220
You may find it in yourself, inside, in breaking down preconceived thinking about

347
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:31,240
Homeopathy. So it is the inner struggle you have to go through also.

348
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:34,890
Let's see what happened.

349
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:52,890
-I'm asked whether I was better emotionally after taking the remedy?

350
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:08,750
I really can't remember. I know I felt physically worse but it seemed to me that my mood

351
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:16,830
went up and down and sometimes I felt very discouraged and sometimes I felt more

352
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:27,170
emotionally strong and I can't remember whether that emotional state sometimes good

353
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:32,420
and sometimes bad was any better or worse than before I took the remedy.

354
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:41,020
I'm only aware that the physical pain was worse.

355
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:48,170
-Did you say that you slept better up to a certain time. Is that true?

356
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:58,970
-Yes about a week. Then after that first week I started...

357
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:03,300
-After the first week or the first weeks?

358
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:12,710
-The first week, then it started being badly and

359
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:15,970
not being able to get to sleep until 4 o'clock in the morning.

360
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:20,040
-What potency?

361
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:27,890
-I think 200 and 1M.

362
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:36,920
-You are in the house most of the time?

363
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:44,640
-Yes, I go to do my own grocery shopping and sometimes I visit people but not very often.

364
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:58,880
They usually come to me and I read and I've writing some songs...

365
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:09,960
Sometimes I get a takeout dinner,  have dinner in my house,

366
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:16,220
I watch television usually in the evening.

367
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,510
-But your schedule continued to be the same during these two weeks.

368
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:25,720
-Pretty much the same. I was a little less physically active...

369
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:38,060
You see if the remedy had acted, it would have created some kind of urge for a human contact.

370
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,300
 I expect it if the remedy had acted.

371
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:47,050
I ask questions that she does not understand whether she will give me the answers I want.

372
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:50,130
Whether she was going out more for instance,

373
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:56,630
whether she was calling a friend to come and have more intercourse with them.

374
00:40:56,730 --> 00:41:04,630
Whether she started moving inside, having the need for a human contact because

375
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:10,140
she was so isolated, so alone before.

376
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:19,720
And if the remedy is breaking through, perhaps some kind of contact because that

377
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:27,720
isolation is the most hard thing in this case to break down.

378
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:34,250
She may give me an answer that she will not understand, then I will make sure that the

379
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:38,750
remedy is working, then I will be at ease and I will say placebo.

380
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:43,970
But until that time I'm not sure and still I'm not sure. Yet at this moment of the interview

381
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:50,050
I'm not sure whether the remedy has acted or not.

382
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:53,580
-You got out less?

383
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:59,580
-Yes.

384
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,340
-Your appetite was the same as before?

385
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:06,300
-I lost my appetite for about a week after taking the remedy.

386
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,800
-You lost completely your appetite?

387
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:13,300
-Not completely but I lost some weight. I lost two pounds.

388
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,890
-Did you like that?

389
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:17,220
-No.

390
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,970
-You want to pick up weight?

391
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:21,800
-No.

392
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:29,550
-I can give you a remedy that you can pick up weight very easily, is that OK with you?

393
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:40,150
-If you think it will do me good, yes OK.

394
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:44,720
You see the human nature? I said you lost weight.

395
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:51,770
What she tells me all the time is she remembers everything bad that happens.

396
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:57,220
She remembers the first week she lost weight, she remembers the first week she lost her

397
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:01,570
appetite, she remembers she lost two pounds the first week, she does not remember

398
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:06,910
anything positive that happened. She remembers all the negative.

399
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:13,660
What about your appetite? Oh my appetite yes, now I fix you.

400
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,980
 I lost my appetite the first week.

401
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:23,680
She knows that is not a good symptom and to prove that she lost her appetite,

402
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:30,180
she says I lost two pounds in a week.

403
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:47,430
Did you like it? Then she backs up again.

404
00:43:47,530 --> 00:44:01,980
All this play is to bring out the resistance. No, I don't like to lose weight.

405
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:06,240
That means you want to pick up weight.

406
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:14,240
We have a remedy I can give you to pick up weight.

407
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:18,990
She is afraid now, I may give her a remedy to pick up weight but it was bad that

408
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:23,320
she lost her appetite and she lost one kilo.

409
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:26,690
Now I tell her I give you a remedy to pick up weight,

410
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:29,440
no I don't want that.

411
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:35,170
She is projecting everything which is bad. The treatment is not successful, I'm not better,

412
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:42,320
I'm worse and I'm trying to give you this, I don't remember, confusion.

413
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:50,320
Everything that goes on in the case is for me a resistance to give me the facts.

414
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:57,810
More and more I confirm that really she does not want to get well.

415
00:44:57,910 --> 00:45:04,560
She is set up in that situation and she is afraid, insecure to go into another state where

416
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:10,310
if she is well, the first thing which she has to do is to go out and work.

417
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:18,060
Back to work but back to work is back to this jungle of people, competitions,

418
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:27,600
she has to keep the job and she is very insecure, afraid of that.

419
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:30,150
-Do you really want to be well?

420
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:32,430
-Yes I do.

421
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:41,650
-Are you sure or you are quite set in this kind of situation where you say I'm unable,

422
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:48,680
I can't do anything and this environment feels secure for you and

423
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:52,680
you don't want to change it, to go out and seek a job?

424
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:54,440
Have you thought about that issue?

425
00:45:54,540 --> 00:46:04,180
-Yes I thought and I feel familiar with the way I handle my life right now and I feel that

426
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:12,490
most of the time I'm able to deal with it and it is frightening for me to go out and work and I

427
00:46:12,590 --> 00:46:16,480
don't really know how I'm going to do that but

428
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:25,380
that doesn't stop me from wanting to be well because I'm suffering and I don't want to.

429
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,830
-But if you are well, you are going to be forced to go out and work.

430
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:38,380
-That's true and that frightens me.

431
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:44,800
Do you see? She has thought about that issue, to go out and work is very frightening.

432
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:54,550
It is very difficult for her. She verbally says, well it doesn't stop me from wanting to be well

433
00:46:54,650 --> 00:47:06,230
but it's really a frightening issue for me to think that I have to go out and work.

434
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:15,880
-Have you dealt with that matter intellectually? You said you thought about this,

435
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:20,660
what is your decision?

436
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:24,740
You have decided that I really want to get well and when I'm well

437
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:29,490
I can go out and work and deal with the issues of the world?

438
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:35,490
-I decided that I have to... that I'm doing and when I'm able to do more,

439
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:42,990
I will do more and tell that I really can take care of myself.

440
00:47:43,090 --> 00:48:06,840
I'm trying not to be in anxiety about, I'm trying to think it's going to get better.

441
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:13,820
-When did you stop working?

442
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:20,320
-About 6 years ago I had a part time job but it was only once the week and

443
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:27,070
I didn't work for 2-3 years before that.

444
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,030
-What company?

445
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:31,240
-I was a cleaning lady.

446
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:38,530
-Did you make enough money?

447
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:43,620
-Yes it was enough.

448
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:50,490
Do you see the issue? Do you perceive what is happening inside her?

449
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:59,830
If I'm well, I'm not skilled, I have to go and work out as a cleaning lady.

450
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:01,820
Do you see with what you are battling now?

451
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:10,570
You have given a remedy and you are battling to break through this set up situation.

452
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:14,900
I asked her, are you happy with this set up? She said yes because

453
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:20,160
I learned how to deal now and my life is ordered and

454
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:21,150
I know what to do.

455
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:28,000
I'm frightened to think that if I'm well I have to go out and work.

456
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:34,730
Looking superficially in this case and not understanding,

457
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:38,490
would you change your remedy here? You would change your remedy.

458
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:40,240
You would say I made a mistake.

459
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:42,830
You expect other things to happen, they cannot happen in this case.

460
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:52,330
That's too deep crystallization, too hard things happening inside to break down so fast.

461
00:49:56,120 --> 00:50:04,000
But still the remedy if it was correct, it has to produce that, what I expect to be a

462
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:08,240
break through in some area in her life.

463
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:13,000
That's why it takes me so long with the interview to try to understand what is happening.

464
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:21,580
In some area in her life a breakthrough must have happened if the remedy was correct.

465
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,580
-How much money do you take now? Is the same more or less with the cleaning?

466
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,080
-That's about the same.

467
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:30,910
-But would you like to make some more money, to be successful,

468
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:37,740
to do something that will really bring you out to the world.

469
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:42,250
-I would like to have more money but mainly...

470
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:49,490
I guess the main reason I want to work is to be able to take care of myself and

471
00:50:49,590 --> 00:51:01,490
I want to feel that I'm not useless.

472
00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:07,330
-You have been sighing where you are there now. I didn't hear you sighing the last time.

473
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:18,420
Do you feel you are in a stress, I put you in stress or do you feel comfortable?

474
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:22,660
Do you feel that I bring up issues that are a bit disturbing?

475
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:26,440
-Yes.

476
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:32,530
-How do you deal with them? Inside you now do you have anxiety?

477
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:36,740
-A little, not overwhelming.

478
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:41,940
-But that is an issue that you thought before yourself. It is not that I brought it up.

479
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:43,990
-No, no.

480
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:50,520
-So you are familiar with this issue and you ask yourself many times about that issue.

481
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:54,000
-Yes.

482
00:51:54,100 --> 00:52:01,330
-You have been sighing even before and I'm asking whether you are aware of sighing.

483
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:08,330
-I was aware after you pointed out.

484
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:12,070
-Are you trying to control your sighing now?

485
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:14,910
-No.

486
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:20,160
-Be honest with me.

487
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:22,780
-I don't think I try to control it.

488
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:28,580
-Immediately the thought went to your mind, as soon as we discussed about it and

489
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:32,330
you were observing yourself.

490
00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:40,080
-I wasn't consciously try to hold it down but I think I have an unconscious inhibition

491
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:48,570
when I'm upset not to show anything. I feel constraint.

492
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:55,410
-Tell me something. In your room, where you live, everything is in order?

493
00:52:55,510 --> 00:53:00,250
-I like it in order but it's not always in order.

494
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:12,580
-Tell me something else. Do you have any fear of poverty or something like that?

495
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:24,330
-Yes I have some fear of that.

496
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:35,410
-And you are careful with your money, how to spend them?

497
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:39,750
-Yes and I realize that you are right about that, when you said if I'm avaricious, I first

498
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:44,240
didn't know about that because I thought that he is someone who thinks about money

499
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:53,250
all the time, not in that way but I'm a little avaricious and sometimes I'm generous but

500
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:57,990
sometimes I'm not.

501
00:53:58,090 --> 00:54:00,740
-Do you like the money or you like the security?

502
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:03,490
-Yes I like to know that I have a little savings.

503
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:07,490
-You have a little savings, so you have some kind of security if something happens.

504
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:12,330
This is more or less what I perceived. Is that correct?

505
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:17,660
-Yes and I find it very disturbing to be in debt. If my savings were gone and

506
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:28,410
I had to borrow from somebody, I would be very insecure.

507
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:32,410
One of some other things that you said that I realized later that you are right about,

508
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:40,410
that I can't really think of the time like when I told you about the school and

509
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:43,450
later on you said if it was an experience that repeated that,

510
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:50,000
I couldn't think of anything but I remembered later on that at high school that

511
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:55,940
I went later, a certain group of kids teased me and

512
00:54:56,040 --> 00:55:01,280
it wasn't cool like in the other school but it was mischievous.

513
00:55:05,850 --> 00:55:10,240
They called me spook.

514
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:21,920
Do you hear that? The kids called her spook.

515
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:35,510
The first experience was in her school where the kids were teasing her badly and

516
00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:42,600
she felt very much rejected and hurt by the teasing of the children.

517
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:46,340
Later on she changed the school, she went to another school and

518
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,840
I said did you have repeated experience?

519
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:59,170
In the first interview she said no. Now she says you are right I had again the experience

520
00:55:59,270 --> 00:56:03,430
because I remembered again they called me spook.

521
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:20,170
The fact that I'm approaching a very burning issue for her, she seems a little bit more

522
00:56:20,270 --> 00:56:32,010
open, she is admitting yes I'm avaricious or they called me spook, you are right.

523
00:56:32,110 --> 00:56:42,750
Now we have established a contact. She understands that she cannot get away.

524
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:49,340
She understands that I'm going to get the facts and

525
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:56,840
she decides to volunteer some information. This is behind that interview.

526
00:56:56,940 --> 00:57:01,090
She had resisted and resisted, I said OK you are resisting because most probably

527
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:07,420
you are afraid to go out in the world as a cured person and work again and

528
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:13,670
she said yes actually, I'm frightened. I'm set up here, I know what I'm doing,

529
00:57:13,770 --> 00:57:17,200
it's nice and secure.

530
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:20,710
The other thing I don't know.

531
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:25,670
Do you see the sub-conscious resistance that comes up with the remedy?

532
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:31,180
That's why she took immediately Tylenol, to forget about the treatment,

533
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:37,110
I'm not going to get well.

534
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:46,020
-It wasn't malicious, it was more mischievious.

535
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:55,450
-What I feel is that you are a very nice person, very sensitive and

536
00:57:55,550 --> 00:58:04,450
you felt unprotected in the world and having that sensitivity and

537
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:10,770
not being aggressive in going out to others like somebody steps on you,

538
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:19,270
having all that you eventually ended with a problem of syphilis that

539
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:22,280
came eight years ago.

540
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:25,040
-Yes.

541
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:35,860
-That undermined your constitution somewhat and all that together with the emotional

542
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:43,860
problems brought you in that state in which you feel subdued now,

543
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:50,860
you allow yourself to be subdued under the pressure of disease or whatever it is.

544
00:58:54,210 --> 00:58:59,860
And that's why you try to protect yourself by isolating yourself almost in the house and

545
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:07,390
your environment where you feel secure, where in reality you have very good qualities

546
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:14,900
inside you, much better qualities than many other people that are successful outside.

547
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:24,860
You are correct, you are honest but you feel unprotected, completely insecure.

548
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:35,940
-Yes I do and there was a sensation that I want to describe to you...

549
00:59:55,490 --> 01:00:02,130
In this particular case, you may say it's psychotherapy and all that.

550
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:06,820
It's not, it's human contact and common sense.

551
01:00:07,490 --> 01:00:19,050
I was never trained as psychotherapist but it is my deepest desire that the people get well,

552
01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:27,800
whether somebody has colitis or mental problems but every case has to be treated as

553
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:33,890
a specific individual case. That's what I'm doing. I will never praise anybody else.

554
01:00:33,990 --> 01:00:40,220
Why should I praise? They are good enough, they have self-confidence, I don't want

555
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:43,710
to push their egos?

556
01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:50,220
But in this particular case? That rejection that has gone inside her,

557
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:57,470
complete, total rejection by everybody and there she comes and give a remedy.

558
01:00:57,570 --> 01:01:10,050
Let the remedy do everything but she needs a little bit of affection, you are good,

559
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:18,640
don't be afraid and it's true what I say, I don't tell a lie.

560
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:27,390
I do believe that these sensitive, unfortunate individuals are not the individuals who can

561
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:33,140
say she is sick and just reject it. It is because she has been so sensitive,

562
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:34,890
she came to that state.

563
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:43,580
Everybody has been hurt one or two times in life and we did not arrived in that state?

564
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:50,090
Why she arrived? Because she was too sensitive. Oh, I'm a spook.

565
01:01:51,650 --> 01:02:04,740
But she became a spook and then life went away and now I give her some space to

566
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:12,290
breathe and as soon as I do that, she will volunteer the information.

567
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:19,120
Let's see what happened.

568
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:40,890
-In these last few days I felt like overwhelming burdens that have just been crashing me.

569
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:46,920
I have this problem with my car insurance, they don't want to renew my car insurance and

570
01:02:47,020 --> 01:03:00,140
I don't know where else to go and it's nothing that I did wrong. My driving is perfect and

571
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:05,800
they don't tell me why they don't do and I felt that is completely unjustly.

572
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:14,990
This is happening to me and it's like a blow and it's knocking me down.

573
01:03:15,090 --> 01:03:22,490
I don't feel like this all the time even when I'm in pain but when I feel it,

574
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:26,030
I can't fight things anymore,

575
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:32,070
I feel that arrows are running down on me from everywhere.

576
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:44,530
And often the pain feels like a burden on my head and on my shoulders, crashing.

577
01:03:44,630 --> 01:03:50,070
-Why do you think the insurance people did that?

578
01:03:52,510 --> 01:04:09,410
-I went to an agent and I was on a sign risk because I never had car insurance before and

579
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:17,940
he said a sign risk, why you are on a sign risk like you have a criminal record?

580
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:25,420
Then he said I don't know if I can set you an insurance, I have to submit an enquiry.

581
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:34,930
But I can't wait very long. Then he submitted an enquiry and it didn't go through and

582
01:04:35,030 --> 01:04:38,430
 I had to go elsewhere but

583
01:04:42,230 --> 01:04:45,420
apparently he put the information into the system that

584
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:57,080
he did not sell me an insurance, he said that I was denied an insurance.

585
01:04:57,180 --> 01:05:06,830
I don't know why they don't want to, maybe because I told him I was disable and

586
01:05:06,930 --> 01:05:09,830
I get a pension.

587
01:05:09,930 --> 01:05:12,360
-Did you tell them why you were disabled?

588
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:25,460
-Yes and I told them that it doesn't affect my driving but maybe they didn't believe that.

589
01:05:34,930 --> 01:05:39,330
When I think about it, it's not that terrible because the worse it can happen is to go back

590
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:45,070
to the high risk and it will be more expensive, even if I have the stance I must progress in

591
01:05:45,170 --> 01:05:52,080
my life, the worse it can happen is that I have to pay a couple of 100 more per year.

592
01:05:52,180 --> 01:06:03,410
And it's only money but I feel bad when money have been taken from me and

593
01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:08,910
I feel the injustice, I feel it like an injury to me,

594
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:13,170
they are doing something to me that is not right

595
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:18,160
and I feel almost the compulsion to take them to court.

596
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:23,940
I feel that I have to do something to stand up for myself and I don't know whether

597
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:29,750
I'm up to the task.

598
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:37,490
Do you see while she is talking now about something more intimate how

599
01:06:37,590 --> 01:06:41,820
her voice has changed and it has some color,

600
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:48,070
some intonation showing that things are coming now from the heart.

601
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:53,410
There is more deep information which is coming from her speaking about her private

602
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:57,660
problem which they don't want to renew the assurance and what shall I do and

603
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,500
it was terrible, I feel the burden,

604
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:03,990
I feel they are sending me arrows from all over the world.

605
01:07:07,350 --> 01:07:10,490
Now it is coming up on a different level.

606
01:07:10,590 --> 01:07:15,500
Now maybe she will give the information, now the information may be true,

607
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:17,750
what she is giving.

608
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:26,360
I let her talk about herself, about the intimate things and she is prepared to talk.

609
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:32,100
Maybe I will get some information which is valuable.

610
01:07:32,850 --> 01:07:37,750
-I worry about them and I cry.

611
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:49,440
-Do you cry frequently?

612
01:07:50,190 --> 01:07:56,530
-I have been crying more since I took the remedy. I don't think I cry frequently.

613
01:07:56,780 --> 01:08:00,260
-But you have been crying more, letting the emotions out.

614
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:06,860
-Yes and it was a time that I had a kind of religious...

615
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:24,510
I just now perceive that maybe the remedy is correct, from what she said I have been

616
01:08:24,610 --> 01:08:34,260
crying more. I have not been crying before. For her case it becomes very important.

617
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:40,350
Whatever she has said before, I may disregard but this I cannot disregard.

618
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:48,590
Why she is crying more now? She is opening up to the pain, she feels the pain more now.

619
01:08:48,690 --> 01:08:58,840
That's why she is crying more and you will hear now the experience she had.

620
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:09,420
-I have been praying a lot and reading the Bible a lot and one night I got an Irish song in

621
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:16,840
the television, picked it up and played it and it was so beautiful and I started to

622
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:20,590
cry and I felt...

623
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:30,420
Did you hear her voice breaking down?

624
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:40,350
She wants to cry, her voice is breaking down, now emotions are coming out.

625
01:09:40,450 --> 01:09:56,190
She is opening now, in front of the camera, it doesn't matter. It is big emotional.

626
01:09:56,660 --> 01:10:03,300
Like somebody has stayed in prison for years and first time goes out and

627
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:07,790
does not even believe it she is out.

628
01:10:16,390 --> 01:10:39,590
-...I felt that feeling was god and I just felt so grateful and I felt close to god and

629
01:10:39,690 --> 01:10:49,440
I felt grateful for that and I cried for a long time.

630
01:11:02,610 --> 01:11:08,760
After the remedy she started crying, she cried and cried and

631
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:15,250
one day she had the song and that song reminded her of beauty,

632
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:17,080
she had an opening.

633
01:11:17,180 --> 01:11:24,120
I said this is fantastic what is coming and she felt the presence of god.

634
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:34,880
She felt this connection, she cannot have a human connection but

635
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:40,840
she can have now connection with that which she calls god.

636
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:49,890
The urge to have some contact is breaking up and the contact is established.

637
01:11:49,990 --> 01:11:58,890
She is crying, she is becoming again a human being with emotions, with feelings.

638
01:11:58,990 --> 01:12:02,670
What has happened actually, this is what took place.

639
01:12:02,770 --> 01:12:07,750
This is the important part after the remedy that was given but she broke down she had

640
01:12:07,850 --> 01:12:15,000
emotions and she had the opening up and the religious experience.

641
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:19,840
That is the deep part that we expect in a cure.

642
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:22,670
Never mind the pains now, who cares about the pains.

643
01:12:24,310 --> 01:12:27,000
I want to know whether my remedy is acting on a deep level.

644
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:30,260
Yes it is acting on a deeper level because of that.

645
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:34,870
Now I can be sure, I can go to the class and say don't worry after

646
01:12:34,970 --> 01:12:44,920
20 days the pains will be gone. That is Homeopathy.

647
01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:49,170
You see the struggle, you see what happens in this particular case?

648
01:12:49,270 --> 01:12:55,010
How can you be sure from the beginning?

649
01:12:55,110 --> 01:13:00,710
I showed this case to anybody until that point and they said we don't know,

650
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:05,200
the remedy maybe it is acting, maybe it is not acting.

651
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:10,290
Here I know the remedy is acting.

652
01:13:10,390 --> 01:13:15,290
That opening up is what I expect from the remedy and it has happened and

653
01:13:15,390 --> 01:13:19,510
she kept it secret, all these things,

654
01:13:19,610 --> 01:13:24,750
until I pressed her and I found out what is really going on.

655
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:37,890
Now she understands, now I can talk and then she talks and said all that.

656
01:13:53,970 --> 01:14:01,370
Further than that it's not important anymore. The remedy has acted.

657
01:14:03,690 --> 01:14:10,170
The problem is now because she took some remedy...

658
01:14:10,270 --> 01:14:23,660
As I told you, that is November and she got the remedy end of October and

659
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:30,160
in the beginning of May I received a telephone call from the practitioner saying,

660
01:14:30,260 --> 01:14:36,650
she has been well with the pains and there seems to be a kind of relapse.

661
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:48,940
Seven months later she had a relapse. That's not a good sign.

662
01:14:49,040 --> 01:15:01,240
With a remedy which you give and acts in deeper level, you expect this remedy to act

663
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:07,240
for a longer period of time, for one year, for two years before she has a relapse.

664
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:12,270
Now why she has a relapse? There are two possibilities for me.

665
01:15:12,370 --> 01:15:19,740
I could not discuss all this in the telephone but this is what I think.

666
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:24,990
In this particular case the stresses of her life are too strong and

667
01:15:25,090 --> 01:15:28,320
might have brought about a kind of relapse.

668
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:34,150
The second thing is that she took the remedy,

669
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:41,160
she has agreed now to cooperate with the treatment.

670
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:46,400
Actually this resistance after all these episodes has broken down.

671
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,660
In the end she will agree to cooperate and

672
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:52,860
she will agree not to take further the allopathic drugs.

673
01:15:52,960 --> 01:16:00,910
By taking the allopathic drugs it might have hindered the action of the remedy and

674
01:16:01,010 --> 01:16:08,010
I said to the class the relapse is going to be more soon that

675
01:16:08,110 --> 01:16:12,050
what we expected from high potency.

676
01:16:12,150 --> 01:16:19,300
Also there is a third possibility that the remedies were not properly potentised.

677
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:28,800
I gave her 1M, 10M, say 10M was the highest potency she took.

678
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:35,930
But I'm not sure any more about the real potentization of the remedies.

679
01:16:36,030 --> 01:16:41,930
I have examples where again and again I've given a high potency where I expect for

680
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:53,450
this potency to act for a longer period of time and it acts like a small potency.

681
01:16:53,550 --> 01:16:59,440
Before we have absolutely reliable medicines and medicines which are done in

682
01:16:59,540 --> 01:17:08,430
a proper way, we cannot predict very much the time of relapse.

683
01:17:08,530 --> 01:17:13,940
But I expect with a 10M potency in this case one and a half year to go without pains and

684
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:17,770
perhaps after one and a half year by stresses that

685
01:17:17,870 --> 01:17:22,260
will be affecting her life to have a kind of relapse.

686
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:31,020
But seven months with such potency is not usual, the remedy should have hold longer.

687
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:37,490
So they are either too many stresses in her life or the Tylenol and the antihistamine she

688
01:17:37,590 --> 01:17:45,460
took hindered the action or the potency was not really potentised.

689
01:17:50,180 --> 01:17:55,830
The practitioner said the pains are exactly the same, she persuaded me that

690
01:17:55,930 --> 01:18:02,980
it was a relapse. So we will see what happens.

691
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:04,320
-You repeated the remedy?

692
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:10,160
-Yes I repeated it now in May.

693
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:17,430
-Are you not afraid that she would commit suicide after the first remedy?

694
01:18:19,030 --> 01:18:28,760
-No, I've never seen it happening.

695
01:18:30,410 --> 01:18:38,380
I believe that with the right remedy they don't commit suicide.

696
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:45,210
It never happened to me. I've heard some stories.

697
01:18:45,310 --> 01:18:52,490
It was in 1976 where Ortega gave a case.

698
01:18:52,590 --> 01:18:58,810
He said I had a case, he was mentally ill and I prescribed Sulphur and

699
01:19:00,390 --> 01:19:06,490
3 or 10 days after the Sulphur, I can't remember now, this man committed suicide.

700
01:19:06,590 --> 01:19:09,000
So most probably I should not give him Sulphur,

701
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:13,240
I should give him some other remedy because Sulphur acted too deeply on the psoric element...

702
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:16,710
Different theorizing about this idea.

703
01:19:16,810 --> 01:19:31,710
This is the only case that I've heard but can you be sure that

704
01:19:31,810 --> 01:19:34,210
this was the action of Sulphur?

705
01:19:34,310 --> 01:19:38,700
First of all Sulphur was indicated?

706
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:47,820
Maybe Sulphur was given without being indicated and the person accidentally committed

707
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:52,540
suicide after taking Sulphur but Sulphur was not indicated, maybe Arsenicum was

708
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:59,790
indicated or another remedy, how I'm sure that it was the really indicated remedy and

709
01:19:59,890 --> 01:20:05,800
that remedy stirred that thing and made him commit suicide? How do I know that?

710
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:13,290
I had to know this case beforehand myself and to agree that this is a Sulphur case and

711
01:20:13,390 --> 01:20:16,050
everybody agrees this is a typical Sulphur, we give Sulphur and

712
01:20:16,150 --> 01:20:18,300
then he commits suicide, to be sure about it.

713
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:23,040
Who tells me he did not give the wrong remedy?

714
01:20:23,140 --> 01:20:24,040
So it doesn't mean anything.

715
01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:31,230
That was the only incident I had in my life about the question you are asking but

716
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:37,880
as I said I'm not sure it was the right remedy.

717
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:45,120
I've seen it with Aurum during the aggravation in the 24 hours after Aurum,

718
01:20:45,220 --> 01:20:51,380
where the impulses for committing suicide can become very strong.

719
01:20:51,480 --> 01:21:01,130
But in a real Aurum case, I have seen recovery after

720
01:21:01,230 --> 01:21:07,880
the first 24 hours without any further depression.

721
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:13,080
During that time we usually say you have to be careful, we say to the other people,

722
01:21:13,180 --> 01:21:14,580
just be careful for the first days.

723
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:21,330
Usually the person reports I have strong impulses for committing suicide but

724
01:21:21,430 --> 01:21:27,440
they never do.

725
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:34,980
But if you give Aurum to a case where it is not Aurum, it is Arsenicum and

726
01:21:35,980 --> 01:21:40,460
you give Aurum and after Aurum he commits suicide,

727
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:48,960
you cannot say you gave the right remedy and committed the suicide.

728
01:21:49,060 --> 01:21:54,460
The right remedy will free the person into a deep level to the extent that

729
01:21:54,560 --> 01:22:00,550
the desire to live is the first to come back, the desire to be alive.

730
01:22:00,650 --> 01:22:06,120
It is the joy of life.

731
01:22:06,220 --> 01:22:13,630
What she felt is a big relief from that experience. It is so joyful the experience,

732
01:22:13,730 --> 01:22:20,880
it is a religious experience the feeling of the presence of god in her life.

733
01:22:20,980 --> 01:22:21,870
It is so fulfilling.

734
01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:28,960
She said I felt very well for a few days afterwards.

735
01:22:51,000 --> 01:23:04,660
-I thought a religious, I felt much less anxiety about my situation to come and

736
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:08,420
it didn't last completely. I have had moments since then but

737
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:24,360
a lot of good feeling lasted.

738
01:23:26,910 --> 01:23:31,150
-Would you be able to resist the Tylenol? This is a big issue.

739
01:23:31,250 --> 01:23:33,640
-Yes.

740
01:23:35,490 --> 01:23:48,640
-You don't have to work, even if you feel well. Only if you can't do otherwise or

741
01:23:48,740 --> 01:23:51,260
you feel pleasure doing that.

742
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:59,220
Don't put yourself into a situation to say if I have to go to work...

743
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:01,310
Forget that issue.

744
01:24:01,410 --> 01:24:12,350
Say that you will work, if you find real pleasure in doing something.

745
01:24:12,450 --> 01:24:19,840
Not to put yourself into that conflict inside you. Forget about it completely. Let yourself.

746
01:24:19,940 --> 01:24:26,840
Because you are such a nice person inside and

747
01:24:35,950 --> 01:24:38,340
you have this spiritual relationship with god.

748
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:47,180
Even that is crowded by different fears and anxieties that are inside you,

749
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:57,260
they don't allow the freedom to connect and let your feelings acting.

750
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:03,010
If you want to cry, cry. It is a natural thing. If you want to pray, pray,

751
01:25:03,110 --> 01:25:12,630
you want to talk to a friend, talk, if you don't want, don't.

752
01:25:12,730 --> 01:25:24,100
But the big issue for us is not to take drugs. I'm sure the remedy underneath will act,

753
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:30,100
we will give some support.

754
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:32,340
-I will try harder.

755
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:36,600
-Thank you for coming.

756
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:43,940
-Thank you.

757
01:25:46,190 --> 01:25:51,950
