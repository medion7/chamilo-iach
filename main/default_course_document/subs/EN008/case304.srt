1
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:26,550
-Where you will start? I see you've been through a lot.

2
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:38,230
-Maybe I will start with the physical problems

3
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:45,330
but then I think the emotional problem is the main problem.

4
00:00:50,520 --> 00:01:07,640
I have dermoi cyst in my right ovary, it's a kind of tumor which is there for a long time.

5
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:17,240
I know about it for 8 years already and the doctors want to operate it

6
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:36,000
but I had two children since I know about it and I don't want to operate,

7
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:42,750
especially not before I finish with the children and I'm pregnant now.

8
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:52,410
That's one thing that wasn't change by Homeopathy until now.

9
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,150
-What remedies did you have so far?

10
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:04,890
-When I first got to know for Homeopathy, it was French Homeopathy

11
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:15,390
and it was in my second pregnancy, I had severe headaches and I got few remedies,

12
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:23,390
I don't know exactly what. I know that one of them was Sepia and it helped with the headaches.

13
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:30,650
But then I got a lot of Sepia, every time I had a headache and then I was depressed,

14
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:38,470
so I got a lot of Platina from the French homeopath and I don't know if this didn't complicate

15
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:49,560
because I had a lot. I got Apis for the tumor for few months, very low potencies.

16
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,050
-6X?

17
00:02:51,150 --> 00:03:00,480
-About and then 2 years ago I started with classical Homeopathy,

18
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:12,300
so the first remedy was Stramonium and I got this for the impression of the homeopath

19
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:28,390
that I was very inside death and she found me in the middle between life and death.

20
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:35,790
I felt that this did something; I'm not in the same situation that I was before,

21
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:39,540
I will just tell you the occasions.

22
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:49,910
When I was 22 I had a boyfriend, we were living together like a couple for 4 years already

23
00:03:50,010 --> 00:04:00,670
and he had cancer in his bones and for 2 years he was very difficult sick

24
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:14,580
and I was with him all the time. Mainly me, I was with him all over the world with operations.

25
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:27,420
He died when we were 24 and it was a big trauma for me. Then I got married

26
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:34,770
and I had children but it was still very much inside me, still now I feel it.

27
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:42,760
-Did you cry after his death or you kept it inside?

28
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:53,670
-I think I cried and I was talking about it but it was a drama that I didn't finish with it

29
00:04:53,770 --> 00:05:01,080
because it was like a surprise for me when he died; I was not prepared,

30
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:07,600
he was sick for so much time and I was in the hospital and everybody was talking about it

31
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:12,330
and I couldn't realize that, that would happen.

32
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:26,100
It was a shock and I feel that still I'm trying to understand what it is that somebody is dead.

33
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,430
-You are afraid of death now?
-About myself no.

34
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,780
-About your children?

35
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:39,090
-Yes, I feel anxious about my children's health.

36
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:43,930
-Very anxious?
-I think so, yes.

37
00:05:52,690 --> 00:06:01,430
It's like I feel that I'm not sure that life will keep going.

38
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:13,830
But I don't feel afraid of death myself, I think this is part of my depression

39
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:18,180
that if I die, I die.

40
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:21,330
-Tell me except from Stramonium you took something else?

41
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:32,250
-Yes, afterwards I got twice Sepia, once with 200 and the second with 1000

42
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,050
but I'm not sure about the potency.

43
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:37,060
-And then after Sepia? Sepia had an effect?

44
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,070
-I don't feel that it had an effect.

45
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:42,420
-After Sepia?
-That's it.

46
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,050
-You remember receiving Nat. mur.?

47
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:56,530
-I think that the French gave me Nat. mur. maybe it was one day Sepia, one day Natrum..

48
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:02,280
-After the death of your friend, did you get any Nat. mur?

49
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:08,140
-No, I wasn't involved with Homeopathy at all.

50
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:14,040
-So it was years after when you went to Homeopathy.

51
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:20,120
Now your physical problem except of the tumor in the cyst...

52
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:40,120
-I have a kind of allergy, it was very strong, I had it every spring from many things

53
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:51,370
and I feel it's better, Homeopathy did a bit good with it but it's still going on.

54
00:07:51,470 --> 00:08:04,620
Before I came here I touched some clothe with dust, things that I kept for long time

55
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:17,620
they make me sneeze a lot and maybe after one hour of sneezing, I feel it like a flu.

56
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:24,790
All the mucus membranes become inflamed and I feel a bit fever.

57
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:29,210
-And your nose is running like water?

58
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:39,970
-Mostly it's blocked but also it's running and I'm always with a tissue in my pocket,

59
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,940
it's always a bit running.

60
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,790
-Like water or mucus?

61
00:08:46,890 --> 00:09:00,380
-More like water but at the same time it's blocked, it's never open completely.

62
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:18,450
Also I have yeast infection in the vagina, itching.

63
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,940
-With leucorrhea?

64
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:32,180
-It's not so much coming out but it's inside, white and it tastes sour

65
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:45,940
and it makes me have problems with the sexual intercourse because it feels pain

66
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,940
and it's not comfortable.

67
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:56,440
It's not so common but it comes from time to time and mainly it comes

68
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:03,190
when I'm tensed and also the allergy.

69
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:10,290
If I'm calm, I can touch things and I won't have it but if I'm tensed

70
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:14,830
I will have it and also the infection.

71
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:25,110
I remember having it very strong before I had my first child.

72
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:32,870
I was trying to get pregnant for 3 years and it didn't go easily,

73
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:42,870
so the doctors gave me hormones and I had to make sex at certain day.

74
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:48,870
So I had it all the time because I was under stress.

75
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:58,090
-During that time did you have discharge, like leucorrhea?

76
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,010
-Not so much.

77
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:09,850
Only itching and there is white discharge but it's not coming out.

78
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:18,730
It feels dry but it's not dry.

79
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:24,380
-When you have sexual intercourse, you feel dryness in the vagina?

80
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:38,130
-Not always, only when I have stress. I have headaches since I was teenager,

81
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:49,630
it was very strong and also I told you in the second pregnancy I couldn't do anything

82
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:56,630
for few days or two weeks and now I have it from time to time

83
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:01,990
and always at the beginning of the menses.

84
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:17,710
Sometimes it starts here above the teeth and I feel it like congestion here and it goes up,

85
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:30,140
above the eyes, especially the right eye and then it covers the head around.

86
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:36,550
And also at the same time I feel very much tense here.

87
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:42,290
-And it starts before menses?
-About one day.

88
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:47,470
When I have the headache, I know tomorrow I'll have it.

89
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:54,630
-And the headache is so strong that you have to lie down in bed or you function?

90
00:12:54,730 --> 00:13:00,880
-Sometimes I function but I had times in my life that I couldn't function at all

91
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:12,390
and what aggravates the headache is when I sneeze. If I sneeze, it's so strong...

92
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:40,530
I have pains in my legs, especially the soles, it feels dry and burning

93
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:53,790
and when it gets worse, then it goes up to the leg. Of course it was in pregnancy

94
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:56,640
and during menses.

95
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:11,490
I wanted to say that I don't have any nausea while I'm pregnant.

96
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:23,860
I was in the flying dolphin, nothing. That's it about the physical.

97
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,870
-Now what are your real problems?

98
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:39,620
-There are a few things. I don't know how to start.

99
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:47,780
-I'll tell you how to start. Was any time where you felt good, normal

100
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:55,270
or there was no time that you felt that? Age wise.

101
00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:04,520
When you are 10,11, 7,8 was a time that you felt good no problems

102
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:10,860
and then problems started? Or you can't remember?

103
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:18,610
-It's hard to say, I don't really remember a very good time.

104
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:22,760
-You were born where?
-In Jerusalem.

105
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,020
-By Jewish parents?
-Yes.

106
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:31,450
-You had a hard time?
-No, no.

107
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:40,100
I think my childhood was OK but I was not happy.

108
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:50,330
-Why? You wanted to do things that your parents did not allow?

109
00:15:50,430 --> 00:16:01,330
-No, I think I was very serious and I was trying to be good and to do the things

110
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:09,830
that were accepted and I have this problem now which is one of the problems

111
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:13,820
that I want to talk about.

112
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:20,580
I have two children and I feel that I can not be very happy with them,

113
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,580
I can not play with them and I think that maybe I didn't play,

114
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:32,680
I can not be like a child with them, I can not feel alive...

115
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:40,430
It makes me very sad.

116
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:49,830
-That you can not feel joy. What you say is I don't feel joy.

117
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:58,160
-The joy is coming from outside, from them, from my husband.

118
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:04,910
When you asked me before when it was good time, I had good times

119
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:22,320
when I got in love with my husband or friends before. This time was very good.

120
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:28,830
-That means when you had sexual and emotional relationship,

121
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:39,240
that moment you were getting some joy and then you were falling back into indifference

122
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:49,090
or apathy or depression?
-It's not indifference I think.

123
00:17:51,090 --> 00:18:06,670
There is a kind of sadness inside and I feel like the vitality the liveness,

124
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:11,490
the joy is coming from other people, they can give it to me

125
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:17,490
and I can not give it to myself and not to others.

126
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,850
-You are crying easily?

127
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:29,320
-I was crying easily when I was young and last years I'm not crying easily

128
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:34,890
but if I'm excited like now ...

129
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:46,970
Very small things, my voice is trembling like crying, it's not real crying.

130
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:53,220
If I read books for the children and it's emotional.

131
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:59,150
-Do you get a chock here in the throat like constriction?

132
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:06,380
-I did have an Ignatia experience. It was not with Homeopathy

133
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:14,570
but it was very strong much before I get to know Homeopathy.

134
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:34,410
I don't know exactly what it was, it was the death of my friend or problems with my husband;

135
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:47,290
at the beginning it was difficult, I was jealous and I started art therapy

136
00:19:47,390 --> 00:20:02,030
and I had an experience like something was here and I had to take it out in visualization

137
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:06,540
and then I got pregnant. I couldn't get pregnant before.

138
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,280
-After you felt these emotions coming out.
-Yes.

139
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:21,720
-Do you remember yourself suppressing your emotions when you were a child?

140
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:36,390
Consciously? That means you liked somebody and there is a friend of yours

141
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:43,480
who got him and you tried to close your heart, things like that.

142
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:59,320
-I remember two things. Once I remember I was about 8 years

143
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:06,540
and I had to go to an operation to take out my tonsils because in my childhood

144
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,540
I had many times tonsillitis.

145
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:19,790
I remember I was in the hospital and my father was walking outside

146
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:35,540
and I remember myself worried about him that he is outside worrying about me

147
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:46,940
and also when I was a teenager, the man who is my husband now we were friends,

148
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:58,950
in the same neighborhood and I was in love with him and he had other friends

149
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:03,190
and I had to live with it.

150
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:14,190
It's not a suppression but I have to live with it and when we were together

151
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:23,540
and I was older I felt like I won. Something that I couldn't gain when I was a child.

152
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:31,040
-What year was that? When you were 18 or 19 or 20?

153
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:40,210
-After the death of my other friend, it was when I was 24-25.

154
00:22:43,950 --> 00:23:00,210
-You told him that you liked him?
-This time no, it just happened.

155
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:04,780
-But you said then I decided I won him and...

156
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:14,440
-No, no it just happened. I was so depressed after what happened to me with the death.

157
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:19,940
It's not that I wanted something, we just came together.

158
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:27,050
-And then you were crying for the other man and he tried to console you?

159
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,540
-We were trying to console each other.

160
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,530
-Because he lost his girlfriend also.
-Yes.

161
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:38,030
-What about consolation? Do you like being consoled?

162
00:23:38,130 --> 00:24:03,520
-It's not easy for me when I'm consoled. I think I want the affection,

163
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:16,620
I think I can not be consoled, it doesn't help. It's like it does the opposite.

164
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,120
I wanted to say another thing.

165
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:35,780
With my husband I always had the feeling that he may leave me sometime

166
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:44,040
and it combined with the feeling that I don't have inside something to give.

167
00:24:49,810 --> 00:25:01,430
Generally and with the children at home I feel so not available,

168
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:11,280
it's not only that I don't play with them but I don't have the patience,

169
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:23,270
I'm in something else and I'm very much duty conscious, I have to do this...

170
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:26,520
-You work at the same time or you look after your children only?

171
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,270
-I work yes.

172
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:29,770
-What is your work?

173
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:41,110
-Now I work like a teacher. I teach computers and movement.

174
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,850
-Alexander technique?
-No.

175
00:25:55,340 --> 00:26:02,580
And sometimes I'm also angry with them and that makes me feel very guilty

176
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,540
when I'm angry with the children.

177
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:16,830
I'm angry and I can shout at them and if I have to do something and they are in the middle,

178
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:23,580
I don't have time for them and I feel very guilty about it, I want to be ...

179
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,090
-Loving and affectionate and you can not.

180
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:30,090
-It's never enough.

181
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:34,580
-But tell me your children are with you now or you left them in Israel?

182
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:38,590
-I left them, it was very difficult.

183
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:43,830
-The first time you left them?
-No, it's the third time.

184
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:53,170
-When you leave them do you fell home sick immediately after a day or two?

185
00:26:53,270 --> 00:27:00,020
-This time I feel it very strong, I think it's also because of the pregnancy.

186
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:10,660
I feel that my place is there now but other times it's very difficult to leave them

187
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,000
and then I'm OK.

188
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,950
I'm here and OK.

189
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:31,710
-But this time what do you feel in this respect? Strong home sickness?

190
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:40,050
-No I don't think that it's home sickness.

191
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:43,560
-It's worrying about?

192
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:57,810
-Worrying, guilt feelings and worrying if something happens to me or to them

193
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:05,410
and now I just heard that my child has fever, so I feel anxious.

194
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:21,810
-How is your memory?
-Very bad.

195
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:26,150
-What do you forget, can you give us examples?

196
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:32,160
-Sometimes I forget something that I was about to do.

197
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:41,060
So I feel that I can not be trusted, I don't feel responsible

198
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:49,060
because if I have to call... you will tell me call me at 4 and now it's 2

199
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:55,310
and I will forget to call you at 4, it's gone and I make lists

200
00:28:55,410 --> 00:29:02,060
but I forget to look at the lists and I forget names. It's very difficult

201
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:11,310
with the students in school, I don't remember names and I completely forget the past,

202
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:22,220
I don't remember my childhood I don't remember my teenage, I have hints but not...

203
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:30,780
-Not real live experiences of memory, like you are empty.

204
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:42,640
-Yes, I feel sometimes maybe its' something that I'm doing to start every time from the beginning.

205
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:50,780
Because if I get to remember, I don't like myself like it was,

206
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:59,630
so maybe it's better for me to forget and to be someone else all the time.

207
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:05,130
-Medically have you checked your blood pressure?

208
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:12,120
-I checked my blood pressure when I'm pregnant and they say it's OK.

209
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:22,130
My mother has very high blood pressure, she takes medication.

210
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:35,530
-You are sighing. Do you know it?
-I know yes, sometimes it's a lot.

211
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:45,290
-And sometimes you go... as if you don't have enough and you make a noise like this

212
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:48,540
or it is not with noise.

213
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,130
-It's not with noise, it's to feel.

214
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:57,790
-But not that you have to do like this.

215
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:08,460
-No and one thing very important is that I can not decide, it's very strong.

216
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,950
It's not that I can not decide, I don't know what I want.

217
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:19,960
-Even small things?

218
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:27,970
-Even small things, in big and in small things. Like I had to decide to come here or not

219
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:33,700
it was very big, very difficult and I had to decide if to take this sweater or not,

220
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:42,480
it was very difficult. And when I have to decide, I have to sigh a lot.

221
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:46,890
In shopping it is so difficult for me.

222
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:52,290
-Do you eat fruits?
-Yes, I like fruits.

223
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:55,080
-All kinds of fruits?
-All kinds of fruits.

224
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:03,420
-You feel you don't have enough energy or you have enough energy?

225
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,620
-Not enough.

226
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:10,470
-You feel physically tired? Your physical body?

227
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:43,830
Do you feel that you need a lot of protection from your husband, your parents

228
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:50,770
or you can manage or you feel I can not, I can not?

229
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:53,350
-It's both.

230
00:32:53,450 --> 00:33:01,020
I feel that I can not but also I think that there is a big difference in what I feel

231
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:09,610
and what people see from outside. People think that I'm very strong

232
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:15,770
and that I don't need protection and I have it also. I know that I can manage, I know it,

233
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:25,340
I know that I'm talented and that I can do things but inside I feel very low.

234
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,840
-Very weak.

235
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:50,600
-Yes and sometimes I feel that I'm tight, like I don't have the energy to do things that I want.

236
00:33:51,940 --> 00:34:01,900
It takes so much time to move and to get out and I'm always late.

237
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:14,340
It's both also that the energy is not working very well to move

238
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:21,610
and also that I don't have time because all the time I have to do things

239
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:27,830
and I don't have time to get from one place to another.

240
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:35,200
I go out of home and the minute that I have to be there and I am in a hurry all the time.

241
00:34:54,690 --> 00:35:06,340
-Do you feel that you are in a constant state like that or you feel ups and downs?

242
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:14,340
One moment you are very happy, the other .. or you are in a steady state like this?

243
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,840
-Yes steady.

244
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:25,380
-Mostly how would you describe your inner state? As sadness, as indifference,

245
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:40,940
apathy, depression, anxiety, fear, guilt, which is the main, if you can...?

246
00:35:46,930 --> 00:36:04,690
-It's very hard to say. I have strong guilt feelings and also I think strong sadness.

247
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:19,240
-But this sadness is like you don't want to live, you want to die?

248
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:27,680
-No, it's like something that covers everything.

249
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:35,860
-Your real emotions are covered by that sadness and nothing can come out.

250
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:54,950
-Yes. I'm not sure because maybe what covers everything is maybe a depression.

251
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:11,000
-You have anxiety you said about your children. What about your husband.

252
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,850
Do you have anxiety about your husband also?

253
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,780
-No, mostly is my children.

254
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:42,110
-Do you have any fears, are you afraid of anything? Dark, thunderstorms, bombs, wars.

255
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:49,760
-Everybody is afraid of wars. Yes maybe that something very terrible will happen

256
00:37:52,450 --> 00:38:00,750
and that people will suffer a lot and I will have to see it.

257
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:07,500
Sometimes they have the pictures but in our reality...

258
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,780
-Yes you have that reality.

259
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:23,340
-But sometimes also when I see in television earthquakes that people suffer so much.

260
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:30,850
-That makes you what? Anxious or sympathetic?

261
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:39,340
If somebody is suffering and you look at somebody who has pains and you are sympathetic,

262
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:46,020
you suffer together or you can face it normally?

263
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:56,740
-I can face it unless it's a relative, with my children, a relative or someone

264
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:15,420
that I have to take care about him, then I become very anxious and I'm very much involved

265
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:21,350
and I want to help and to do.

266
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:29,080
It's all the time in my mind, like my life stops and I'm into this situation.

267
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:35,020
If somebody dies, then I have to be with the relatives.

268
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:43,340
-But then you have feelings or still that sadness, that cover is there or the feelings

269
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,610
then start coming out during that time?

270
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:01,600
-I think in myself it's all the time.

271
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:17,730
-When you had this first relationship with the boy, 4 years, you were in love with him?

272
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,560
-Yes.

273
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:23,060
-So you had emotions?
-Very strong.

274
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:30,810
-And erotic emotions, sexual and you were in love with him?

275
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:33,420
-Yes.

276
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:48,060
-When is the time that these emotions were lost, immediately after his death, after a month,

277
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:57,810
after 5 months, after 5 years or slowly?

278
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:08,170
-He was sick for a long time?
-Two years.

279
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:15,660
We were four years before he had the cancer and then we were two years with the cancer.

280
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:20,760
So during these two years things happened.

281
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:31,240
I think that my feelings instead of being like a lover with him,

282
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:46,330
I became like a mother with him, something like this and my feelings then were complicated already.

283
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:53,000
-And there you lost your feelings during that period?

284
00:41:54,510 --> 00:42:01,660
-It's hard to say because I think so that it is so but also I remember times

285
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,660
when I was teenager that I had this kind of depression also.

286
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:15,990
It was not something completely new. It was very strong then.

287
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:27,150
-But when you met him your feelings opened up and you enjoyed being with him.

288
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:30,910
You were living in the same house?
-Yes.

289
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:35,410
-But no children with him.
-No.

290
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:43,810
-Why? Because he could not have a child?
-We were still young, we were in the army.

291
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:47,590
-You were protecting yourselves.
-Yes.

292
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:56,410
-He was faithful to you this first boy?

293
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:15,560
-I think he was faithful, I'm not sure. I'm very faithful and while he already had the cancer

294
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:24,900
at this time of course he was faithful but he told me that one girl that he met in the hospital,

295
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,900
she fall in love with him and it was so strange for me that he is sick

296
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:38,900
and he got involved with things, I'm so much faithful all the time.

297
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,990
-So it was a shock for you?

298
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:48,490
-No, it wasn't a sock because he didn't love her, he didn't leave me, he told me about it.

299
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,080
-It was not his feeling, it was her feeling.

300
00:43:56,330 --> 00:44:01,480
-But this affected your feelings? You felt jealous?

301
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:15,320
-No. I think I was already in this stage. It didn't matter so much.

302
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:24,290
-Did you feel jealous while you were with him? When he was looking at another girl,

303
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:26,980
he was speaking?
-Yes.

304
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:30,390
-What you were saying? You were saying something

305
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:36,640
or you just suppressed this jealousy you said, it's not good to talk about it.

306
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:45,900
-Mainly I suppressed these feelings. Also now with my husband I have this fear...

307
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,630
-That he may leave you but...

308
00:44:48,970 --> 00:45:02,620
-But we have very good relationship, we love each other but still I have this fear.

309
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:14,110
I have the jealousy and I won't talk about it unless I feel that I have to talk about it.

310
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:20,300
-To make sure, you want to clear the ground and to clarify.

311
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,250
-Yes.

312
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:28,070
-When you talk, you talk very strongly?
-I can talk strongly.

313
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:38,960
-And then he tells you what? You are crazy, nothing happens.

314
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:46,460
-What's difficult with my husband is that he is not like this, that he will say it's nothing

315
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:56,140
and you are crazy, he says this is life, I can not promise you anything,

316
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,390
I don't know what will happen.

317
00:45:57,490 --> 00:46:03,710
-He leaves you in the air as something may happen.

318
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:13,810
-Yes. He is very anxious as well for me. I don't why but he is.

319
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:26,720
-Because he has his experience. Can you close your clothes around your neck?

320
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:29,400
-I can but I don't like it.

321
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:33,900
-You always want open your neck?

322
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:47,280
If you have to wear a turtleneck, can you wear it or you have to pull it all the time?

323
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:50,870
-I don't like it, I will pull it.

324
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:58,280
-In bed, what side do you sleep?
-On the right side.

325
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:04,620
-You don't like to sleep on your left side?
-It's much less comfortable.

326
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:13,670
-And if you turn for a while, then you feel palpitation?

327
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:15,350
-No.

328
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:20,460
-Just it doesn't feel comfortable.
-Yes.

329
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:27,120
-Is there any time happened that while you fall asleep,

330
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:36,110
during that time you feel your breathing has stopped and you wake up to take some breath?

331
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:37,960
-No.

332
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:49,350
-When you wake up in the morning you feel good, relaxed from sleep?

333
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:54,070
-No, it takes time.

334
00:47:54,170 --> 00:48:06,840
-How much? One hour or five minutes.
-Not five minutes. Two hours maybe.

335
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:13,470
-Before you are really awake. So you wake up unrefreshed.

336
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:19,570
-I'm not a morning person, I can not wake very early.

337
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:22,890
-What is your best time for you?

338
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:33,020
-It was always the evening and the nights but now with the children, I'm very tired.

339
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:39,840
I can not enjoy this time but this is a good time for me.

340
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:57,730
-Is there any time where you feel, because you forget so easily, oh I'm going crazy

341
00:48:57,830 --> 00:49:04,980
I may go crazy and you have the fear I may go crazy?

342
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:19,240
-No, I don't feel that I will become crazy but I feel that I may become useless,

343
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:24,980
that I may not succeed.

344
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:31,000
It's also difficult for me to read for a long time, I become tired.

345
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:40,990
This feeling makes me feel that I'm not useful.

346
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:49,740
-You have dreams?
-Yes.

347
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:54,590
-You remember your dreams?
-Yes sometimes.

348
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:44,900
The last months I got some dreams. Regularly I don't remember my dreams

349
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:52,230
but I tried to write them so I saw something that is coming again and again

350
00:50:52,330 --> 00:51:07,920
and it's something like irresponsibility that I forget to go to take my children.

351
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:18,320
-Or you forget to go to work.

352
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:34,330
-Or I become very late, I hesitate about something and I forget the time of the flight.

353
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:39,060
Suddenly I realized that it's coming and I'm not prepared.

354
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:51,840
-Do you tolerate more easily cold weather? Do you like cold, fresh weather or you like warm weather?

355
00:51:56,590 --> 00:52:05,980
-When I was young I liked warm weather and I suffered from the winter

356
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:13,760
and now it's too difficult for me to tolerate both and it's also difficult to tolerate heat and warm.

357
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:24,820
-Do you ever get any flashes of heat?
-I used to have but now not.

358
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:30,960
-Your menses are regular?
-Yes it is regular.

359
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:38,800
-And you have any premenstrual syndrome? Any depression, irritability?

360
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:47,890
-I had very strong, I think about this it did improve by Homeopathy.

361
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:55,060
Now I have it but not so strong.

362
00:52:55,160 --> 00:53:03,540
I can be more depressed and irritable for two days but it's not very strong.

363
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:13,270
-If you remember by the time it was too strong, this depression or the situation it was before

364
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:19,280
would go away by the flow, when the flow started then you felt released

365
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:24,520
or it kept going on during menses?

366
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:31,870
-The hard time is before and at the beginning and then it goes away.

367
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:42,020
-The flow of blood in the beginning is little and then next day is full flow?

368
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:51,780
-It doesn't take a whole day. In the beginning it's a little but then in a few hours the flow.

369
00:53:56,530 --> 00:54:05,110
-But not that as soon as the flow becomes full, this premenstrual syndrome is going.

370
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:18,480
-No, when the flow comes, I feel the pains, I'm still not recovering.

371
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:47,590
I also wanted to say that I feel very not easy with communication with other people.

372
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:54,740
It's difficult for me to express, to talk, to find what about to talk.

373
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:59,850
I don't have anything to talk about, also with my children.

374
00:54:59,950 --> 00:55:00,910
-There is no ideas coming.

375
00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:11,510
-No ideas, with the children I'm trying to find stories to tell them and nothing comes in.

376
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:23,760
And with other people I' m also embarrassed to start talking, I never start talking.

377
00:55:24,290 --> 00:55:29,140
-When you go to bed and try to sleep, sleep comes easily?

378
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:35,750
-Easily. Sleep is something very easy for me.

379
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:44,350
-But in the morning you are not rejuvenated.
-No.

380
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:52,740
-In the afternoon do you sleep?
-I like to sleep in the afternoon.

381
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:56,240
-When you wake up from the afternoon sleep?
-It takes time.

382
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:59,090
-Again takes time to recover.

383
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:09,910
-I'm very tired at noon, I have to sleep even for 5 minutes. Then it takes time to recover.

384
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:19,750
-In sleep do you see any saliva running?
-Very seldom.

385
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:23,350
-Your nails are strong?
-Yes.

386
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:28,230
-You perspire a lot?
-No.

387
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:33,400
-Do you take normal salt or more?

388
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:39,260
-I take more salt, I always add salt.

389
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:49,410
-The salt you add is in any place? You go to a restaurant, they bring you the food,

390
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:54,750
you take the salt and you put?
-No. I first taste and then.

391
00:56:57,250 --> 00:57:05,160
-Water how much you drink?
-I'm thirsty.

392
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:07,160
-Cold or room temperature?

393
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:14,710
-I don't care. Also at night, if I wake up at night, I have to drink water.

394
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:28,410
And the water helps me with the headache and if I'm very hungry I feel that I have to eat something

395
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:32,090
or to drink. So I drink water.

396
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:45,660
-Do you like ice cream?
-Not so much. I don't like sweets.

397
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:50,490
-You prefer the salty?
-Yes.

398
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:58,850
-If there is no salt, you will leave the food?

399
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:01,900
-If I'm very hungry I have to eat it.

400
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:07,000
-But you don't enjoy it.
-Yes, I don't enjoy it.

401
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:28,230
-In the sea do you go swimming, you like the sea very much, you feel good in the sea

402
00:58:28,330 --> 00:58:33,590
or you feel tired or more tired near the sea?

403
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:35,650
-I feel good.

404
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:43,760
-And you would say, if you have a headache and you go to the sea and swim with the heasache

405
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:48,010
your headache goes?

406
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:54,850
-I don't know, I didn't try but it feels good to swim.

407
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:12,250
I don't take very cold water because if I take very cold water, it makes the headache.

408
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:20,650
-Can you lie in the sun?
-Not anymore.

409
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:27,320
-What do you feel? That the sun will give you a headache?

410
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:34,880
-Yes and I can not tolerate the heat.

411
00:59:44,570 --> 00:59:52,040
-You eat meat or you are vegetarian?
-I eat it but I don't like it so much.

412
00:59:52,140 --> 01:00:05,560
-If the meat has some fat, you like it better to have some fat or you take it out the fat?

413
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:14,550
-If I take it out is because I know it's not healthy but I can eat it.

414
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:15,540
-You like it as a taste?

415
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:20,220
-Yes, maybe to take it with the bread, if it's salty yes.

416
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,720
-Fish you like?

417
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:30,130
-Now in pregnancy I don't like the smell but I don't care.

418
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:36,470
-Is any food that you don't like at all?
-No.

419
01:00:38,970 --> 01:00:44,830
-Is any food which makes you sick?
-No.

420
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:51,790
-You eat tomatoes, onions, raw onions in the salad?

421
01:00:51,890 --> 01:01:08,530
-I can eat, no problem. If I drink orange juice, I feel in the abdomen distention.

422
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:14,970
-Fresh orange juice gives you gas.
-Yes.

423
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:20,340
-Milk you take?

424
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:28,630
-We don't take so much milk because of health reasons but I like milk.

425
01:02:04,810 --> 01:02:15,040
Also in your notes put that she got Ignatia 30, she felt no effect from Ignatia 30.

426
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:17,050
Put it in your notes.

427
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:51,800
Here, in this case, we have to consider Phosphoric acid, Nat. mur., Ignatia,

428
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:59,660
Lachesis, Medorrhinum.

429
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:10,140
-Aurum?

430
01:03:14,640 --> 01:04:00,470
-Baryta carb., show the analysis, Graphites, Sepia, Platina...

431
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:25,150
In this case the remedy on which we will decide must be an uppermost layer, I would say.

432
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:26,820
Why?

433
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:31,590
-Totality of symptoms is not covered by one remedy.

434
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:35,570
-That's one reason. Another reason?

435
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:46,500
She said she had sadness before, after, so it was there all the time.

436
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:55,550
I said with a difference. Big difference. Who can say what is this difference?

437
01:04:55,650 --> 01:04:58,560
-Emotions are the difference. Less emotions now.

438
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:12,240
-Yes but she said before I used to be also sad. I said yes before but with a difference.

439
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:14,330
What is the difference?

440
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:22,630
If you find this, then you find the remedy.

441
01:05:24,330 --> 01:05:31,230
-Before in the past she was getting into relationships and feel close and feel comfortable

442
01:05:31,330 --> 01:05:35,050
within those relationships from an external outside source

443
01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:38,890
and now that she has additional outside sources like husband and children,

444
01:05:38,990 --> 01:05:43,550
she doesn't have the capacity and it's that lack of capacity that prevents her

445
01:05:43,650 --> 01:05:45,290
from being more complete.

446
01:05:45,390 --> 01:05:51,650
-Correct. The sadness was maybe there.

447
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:57,320
-I could not understand what he said.

448
01:05:58,140 --> 01:06:04,500
-OK, he said before she had sadness but once she had a relationship,

449
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:10,870
this sadness was breaking down and the feelings were coming up.

450
01:06:10,970 --> 01:06:21,550
Now feelings do not come, in spite of the fact that she has husband, she has children,

451
01:06:21,650 --> 01:06:24,650
where is the joy? She says, I have no joy.

452
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:33,210
That means there is a sadness but the intensity of the sadness during these times

453
01:06:33,310 --> 01:06:44,720
is much less than this type of sadness. This type of sadness now is deeper

454
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:54,060
and can not break through joyful things, like having a husband, children, she feels no joy at all.

455
01:06:54,310 --> 01:07:02,980
Before she could break this sadness. She was a sad child yes but she could break this.

456
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:08,380
Therefore that is one point. The other point on which we are thinking

457
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:30,780
that this is an upper layer we have to prescribe, what is it? Can anybody tell me?

458
01:07:46,290 --> 01:07:56,410
All the remedies have sadness. In the past she might had a remedy indicated that had sadness.

459
01:07:56,510 --> 01:08:07,740
Now she may have another remedy indicated for that sadness. It doesn't mean that this remedy

460
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:15,910
has to be right through and I say that the remedy which is indicated now most probably

461
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:22,790
is a different one that the one which was indicated 10-15 years ago.

462
01:08:23,950 --> 01:08:31,060
In spite of the fact she says, I also had sadness back there. Now the remedy is different.

463
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:36,670
Why do I say that? Can anybody tell me why do I say that?

464
01:08:37,330 --> 01:08:42,170
-She now can't tolerate the sun and the warmth.

465
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:50,820
-She used to be a cold person. Now she says I can not tolerate warmth and the sun.

466
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:56,200
That alone means she has changed because it's a general symptom

467
01:08:56,300 --> 01:09:06,750
and when we have a general symptom, like this, we are thinking of the remedy must have changed

468
01:09:06,850 --> 01:09:14,250
and it has become a warm remedy now and the intolerance of the sun can not stand in heat

469
01:09:16,180 --> 01:09:24,690
and when we do the repertorisation, we take into consideration that factor.

470
01:09:25,190 --> 01:09:35,300
We prefer a remedy that has intolerance to sun together with the other symptoms.

471
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:46,450
Therefore Sepia may have been indicated in the past, because Sepia is a remedy

472
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:55,890
which is worse cold but maybe not anymore now. Sepia will not do anything for her now.

473
01:09:59,650 --> 01:10:32,850
So we go to the repertorisation and you see... explain Nat. mur. 21 out of 30.

474
01:10:37,590 --> 01:10:57,320
Irresolution, weakness on memory for proper names, consolation aggravates, sadness,

475
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:04,830
desire for salt have you put?
-Yes it's here.

476
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:28,220
-There was a time where the case looked as if she was going towards Lachesis.

477
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:35,860
The reason for Lachesis was not only the jealousy but also Lachesis

478
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:48,700
in its state of indifference or sadness, the emotions are killed in the way that she describes

479
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:59,590
but the sexual area is quite powerful and it remains alive.

480
01:12:03,290 --> 01:12:12,380
So sexually she is alive but she has...

481
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:22,810
What has happened to her? We start to analyze what has happened to her.

482
01:12:23,790 --> 01:12:31,780
She had this boyfriend whom she loved, she was enjoying and she suddenly felt I'm losing him

483
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:40,600
and he is gone. She said during that time the emotions changed.

484
01:12:42,450 --> 01:12:59,880
She felt a deep sense of helplessness that in front of facts of life, you are helpless,

485
01:12:59,980 --> 01:13:09,640
you can do nothing and that gave her a protection.

486
01:13:12,620 --> 01:13:23,470
The indifference is a way of protecting the emotional part.

487
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:32,970
You become indifferent, you close up, you have no feelings and you don't suffer

488
01:13:36,790 --> 01:13:46,990
and Nat. mur. has that strongly the same way that has it in Lachesis, in Phosphoric acid.

489
01:13:47,450 --> 01:14:06,440
Why not Phosp. acid? Desires fruits, Phosp. acid is there, she is tired Phos. acid,

490
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:12,730
she forgets Phos. acid, she is quite indifferent Phos. acid.

491
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:29,060
What is that you don't like about Phos. acid?

492
01:14:34,210 --> 01:14:37,110
-The strong desire for salt.

493
01:14:37,210 --> 01:14:42,950
-And also?
-The feeling of guilt.

494
01:14:43,450 --> 01:14:46,850
-Feeling of guilt and also?

495
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:51,270
-The remaining emotions and the home sickness which she is totally feeling,

496
01:14:51,370 --> 01:14:56,120
that's the character of Phosphoric.

497
01:14:56,620 --> 01:15:02,940
-Yes, Phos. acid. You remember I asked her about home sickness,

498
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:11,110
she said it's not home sickness, I'm just worrying maybe they are having fever,

499
01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:14,370
it's not real home sickness.

500
01:15:17,550 --> 01:15:22,210
Therefore Phos. acid does not have.

501
01:15:24,710 --> 01:15:28,380
Let's see Phos. acid how many of her symptoms has?

502
01:15:29,370 --> 01:15:32,050
-11 symptoms.

503
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:39,280
-Ailments from grief, anxiety...

504
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:10,130
But if in this case we had a strong case of home sickness, that would be a case of Phos. acid.

505
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:34,360
Now what about the potency? What potency you will chose for this case?

506
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:53,700
Who wants to speak about the potency? Who would prescribe 200?

507
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:12,440
Who would prescribe 1M? 10M? 50M? CM?

508
01:17:14,490 --> 01:17:19,280
This is a case for very high potency.

509
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,930
-But the child?

510
01:17:26,030 --> 01:17:46,590
-No problem. The child will be much more healthy. This case is not easy to move

511
01:17:46,690 --> 01:17:54,190
because she has taken a lot of other remedies and it's not easy to move.

512
01:17:54,940 --> 01:18:00,350
So this case let us she was coming to me for first time in Homeopathy,

513
01:18:00,450 --> 01:18:05,680
I would prescribe 50M, CM one dose.

514
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:22,010
Now I would like to give a lower potency but repeatedly to move this organism.

515
01:18:24,930 --> 01:18:31,680
These cases end up in deep depression.

516
01:18:33,190 --> 01:18:37,660
They are quite serious cases though it doesn't look very serious.

517
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:48,650
When the memory is dropping so much, the inability to express any emotions is so strong,

518
01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:55,170
she describes ... she is not here.

519
01:18:58,820 --> 01:19:12,800
It can go into deeper things. Therefore I would like to start with 200 and give for a few days

520
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:21,480
and watch what is happening every day and then if there is a reaction, we stop.

521
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:29,230
If that does not give any effect, then we go to 10M, just give one dose,

522
01:19:29,330 --> 01:19:36,650
if this does not have an effect we give 50M. With the next possibility

523
01:19:36,750 --> 01:19:46,490
being Lachesis and Phos. acid., Lachesis first.

524
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:59,830
If this does not work. I will stick with Nat. mur. in different potencies.

525
01:20:00,870 --> 01:20:09,480
Nat. mur. 200, 10M, 50M in case there is no effect.

526
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:16,420
And in case there is no effect at all, then you go back to Lachesis 200.

527
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:31,140
-Nat. mur. is a slowly acting remedy. How long would you wait?

528
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:39,660
-Who told you it's a slow acting? No. It can act immediately in depressions.

529
01:20:48,330 --> 01:20:57,400
There are no slow acting remedies. There are slow acting organisms, not remedies.

530
01:21:03,250 --> 01:21:08,390
-I want once again to ask for Phos. acid.

531
01:21:08,490 --> 01:21:13,800
Is it against Phos. acid that she does not want to be alone?

532
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:22,000
That she misses her children because Phosp. acid has this tendency to want to be alone.

533
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:33,890
-It's not against Phos. acid. If she had home sickness that case would be

534
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:42,310
a Phos. acid case but home sickness had to be strong, because she is tired, no emotions,

535
01:21:42,410 --> 01:21:51,330
memory weak, then you go to Phos. acid, you go to the basics.

536
01:21:52,870 --> 01:22:00,480
She is leaving the children and she is alone.

537
01:22:00,580 --> 01:22:03,260
-Yes, so it suits Phos. acid.

538
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:05,230
-That's what I said also.

539
01:22:05,330 --> 01:22:07,980
-So why doesn't she get Phos. acid?

540
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:14,120
-Because her symptoms are not enough, she has symptoms on the other hand

541
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:18,400
of Nat. mur. much stronger.

542
01:22:19,150 --> 01:22:24,310
-I'm talking about Lachesis, why not Phos. acid before Lachesis.

543
01:22:29,730 --> 01:22:37,310
-Because I think that this is a case of a volcano, she does not really realize

544
01:22:37,410 --> 01:22:40,040
the intensity of her emotions.

545
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:44,310
I don't want to say more because she is in the class and you are gossiping

546
01:22:44,410 --> 01:22:58,890
and you are going to tell. Leave things like that, it's OK.

547
01:22:59,810 --> 01:23:02,300
We don't have to know everything.

548
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:19,150
Very strong emotions that are inside. This is not the idea of Phosp. acid.

549
01:23:19,250 --> 01:23:27,630
Of course in a extreme case you can take it but this is not typical Phos. acid.

550
01:23:27,730 --> 01:23:34,380
Phos. acid is dead, is finished, no emotions really. She says no emotions

551
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:42,480
but I can tell you there are so many emotions that she is afraid of her own emotions herself.

552
01:23:44,230 --> 01:23:45,810
So it is different.

553
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:55,380
-I realized liveliness while she was talking about this business with the first boy,

554
01:23:55,480 --> 01:24:01,790
having something in the hospital. Then she was very lively, then I thought it must be

555
01:24:01,890 --> 01:24:06,080
a lot of jealousy inside her, was that right?

556
01:24:06,180 --> 01:24:14,360
-Yes, most probably there was and she admits even today she is jealous of her husband.

557
01:24:14,850 --> 01:24:23,070
She says, I'm today jealous so I could see emotions, no emotions, emotions, no emotions.

558
01:24:36,310 --> 01:24:51,770
Phos. acid I have told you, I'm tired, just leave me alone, tired, tired, it cannot give

559
01:24:51,870 --> 01:25:01,870
and she described I have nothing to give, this is Phos. acid but there are stages of that.

560
01:25:02,580 --> 01:25:09,690
One person says, I can not give and is really dead emotionally, the other one says

561
01:25:09,790 --> 01:25:17,940
I can not give because all emotions are covered and she said, my emotions are covered,

562
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:30,380
I feel my emotions are underneath and there is a kind of cover. This is not typical Phos. acid.

563
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:42,770
-I think we could see her emotions but she couldn't feel them in a way

564
01:25:42,870 --> 01:25:49,030
because she didn't look emotionless at all to me. There were emotions hidden.

565
01:25:49,130 --> 01:25:58,520
-Yes, if I pushed her a little bit she would break out crying, just a little bit and then she...

566
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:14,900
But Phos. acid? Phos. acid says I forget words, I didn't feel ...

567
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:21,660
The problem with the memory of Phos. acid is, it wants to say something,

568
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:31,340
it wants to say glasses, he looks at the glasses and says.... glasses,

569
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:34,220
it takes so long to find the word.

570
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:42,140
I didn't see that. Still the expression on a superficial level it looks like

571
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:52,220
because she says I have no emotions, I express no emotions, I have nothing to give.

572
01:26:53,330 --> 01:26:57,240
The eyes are lifeless also in Phos. acid.
