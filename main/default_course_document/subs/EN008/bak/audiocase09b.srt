1
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:29,390
As we said this is a picture of Stramonium.

2
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:36,840
The boy is disturbed quite deeply.

3
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:53,000
What is interesting for us to see is the contradiction between what he appears to be and

4
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,980
what he becomes when he is mad.

5
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:04,240
Ánd that is a characteristic of Stramonium, as we said before.

6
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:19,950
What I will mention in this case is that the boy seems to be a kind of a genius.

7
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:29,180
This boy you may see becoming very famous one day by bringing out an invention or

8
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,760
bringing out something new.

9
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:46,010
If that prediction comes true, then we may understand how close is a genius with a

10
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:52,000
hyper activity of the brain. Perhaps the hyper activity goes too far. With the Veratrum this

11
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:59,500
is the same thing, hyper activity of the mind that makes the person perceiving things that

12
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:06,330
others will not perceive.

13
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:12,580
Showing the potentialities of the brain also and the potentialities we have to involve further

14
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,320
as a human race.

15
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:22,520
And how much important it is to keep the mind intact.

16
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:30,510
This boy seen by psychiatrists, neurologists, later on when he will break things, he will be

17
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:39,710
put under sedatives and this boy that perhaps is going to become a genius, it is going to

18
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,970
be lost for ever.

19
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:49,660
Unless we realize, unless we see things like that, unless we perceive the whole situation

20
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:57,480
with Homeopathy, we will never appreciate what Homeopathy can do.

21
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,980
And this is very important.

22
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:07,420
In these cases when you see a boy with a pathology which is mental so much, you dont

23
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:13,570
have a problem going high. You can go 50M, you can go CM if you want.

24
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:20,300
It is best, when you start the highest, to start with 10M. Why?

25
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,320
Because you do not know yet how many times you will need to repeat and whether you

26
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,060
have to go higher and higher.

27
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:35,850
Perhaps starting with CM, if we suppose that we have remedies that are really done

28
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:45,480
100.000 times, then it would be very difficult to find higher potencies that have a gap.

29
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:58,920
To find 200.000 times, 1.000.000 times. So it is better you start with 10M and highest

30
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:02,680
50M.

31
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:14,700
This is the follow up now John? OK, let us see.

32
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,200
-He took the medicine on February?

33
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,950
-Yes.

34
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,690
-Do you remember the date exactly?

35
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:05,720
-13th of February.

36
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:15,360
-Could you tell me what you have observed?

37
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:27,970
-Initially, in our first week just before he had it, he was very angry. I went back from

38
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:37,180
London, he wanted all the attention, he could not cope with not getting it and during the

39
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:48,890
first week after he had the pill, he was oscillating between being much more relaxed and

40
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,880
suddenly exploding.

41
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:58,870
By Wednesday evening I spoke to his teacher on the phone and he said, he is doing

42
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:07,980
marvelous and he was astounded, he was waiting to see how long it would last and he

43
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:22,960
said he really has improved enormously. He is doing excellent work and he said that

44
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:31,730
he realized he was one of the brightest children of the class. About a month after we saw you,

45
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:35,850
he said he realized this.

46
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:42,570
This is a very objective report from the teacher and what the teacher that he realized now

47
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:47,760
he is one of the brightest children in class.

48
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:56,950
He saw the potentials of the boy with one dose, Stramonium.

49
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:04,940
It is unbelievable how the balance comes and then a human being becomes a whole.

50
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,460
What Homeopathy does is it brings the pieces together.

51
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:17,880
Many times it has been described as if I become a whole, the action of the remedy.

52
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:25,190
The idea of unity, of one, it is the same idea and the idea of pieces breaking up together.

53
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:31,700
If we were united all of us on a cause and we said OK we spread Homeopathy all over

54
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:39,230
the world, within one year Homeopathy would be.

55
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:47,960
Not only we are not united, not only each one is individualistic but we fight between us.

56
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:54,440
There is a lot of fight, disunity and breaking up into pieces.

57
00:07:54,540 --> 00:08:01,430
We cannot come into consensus and understand that our strength is only because we

58
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:07,820
are very weak at the point by being united; it  doesnt matter what.

59
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:15,760
And then we become a healthy whole and we have to manifest that as a homeopathic

60
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:22,260
community at least from a level before Homeopathy. This is prediction, Im telling you.

61
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:29,660
Unless there is a consensus, there is a unity, Homeopathy is going to go into very slow

62
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:39,160
pace. As soon as we feel all together, Homeopathy will go

63
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:44,140
It is the same thing as a cure. Pieces come together.

64
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,880
My mind was scattered, my heart was scattered, my body was scattered and they seem to

65
00:08:48,980 --> 00:09:12,590
have come together, now they work to another level of existence all together.

66
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:18,200
-About a month after we saw you, he said he realized this. Because this particular teacher

67
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:24,080
has been teaching him since last September.

68
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:39,500
In the look of the child do you see something else now?

69
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:46,080
-Not so dreamy.

70
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,310
-Yes but what is more now?

71
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,790
-He is listening more.

72
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:56,140
-He is listening more but what is his inner state?

73
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:09,330
-He didnt fall asleep.

74
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:15,610
-What is his look?

75
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:25,620
Serious but what I can see is anger. You could not see anger before in his eyes.

76
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:38,690
There is a little bit of anger now, it is coming in his eyes.

77
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:51,180
In these cases I have to tell you how it is going.

78
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:56,140
The progress is not always going like that, in a straight line.

79
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:08,510
You will see progress, regression, progress, regression and if you are observant and you

80
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:14,600
wait, you will see the regressions and you will not immediately jump and give another

81
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,910
remedy but you will wait and it will come up again.

82
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:25,470
It will go like that until you have a real relapse.

83
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:33,490
He may have a relapse at a certain point but its going to be after a year or two years or

84
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:36,970
 after three years the relapse; its not going to be the next month.

85
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:44,710
The next month he tells you he was doing so well but one day he was very angry, it

86
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:50,100
doesnt matter; two days he was angry, it doesnt matter.

87
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:59,260
You will see the upwards and you wait.

88
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,480
-He was angry but not so much.

89
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:08,730
-What are your observations?

90
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:20,200
-He seems to be less frightened. About six weeks ago its probably the last time hes got

91
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:29,620
so angry I didnt know quite what to do. It was a kind of anger that was bitter.

92
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:35,310
And I was getting that quite a bit before. About six weeks

93
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:39,310
-Thats good.

94
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:44,940
-There were changes in my circumstances too which I know affected him because

95
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:54,920
I broke up with my last boyfriend not long ago before I saw you and Ive got very close to

96
00:12:55,020 --> 00:13:03,080
someone Ive known for some years who used to baby sit the children.

97
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:08,270
And we intend to get married but it will take two years because I respect hes got three

98
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:15,660
sons living with him. And that I think its done two things.

99
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:22,550
Its given a security in the fact that the man who was coming to his life quite a lot,

100
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:29,540
 he is more open and hes very unworried by Thomas anger.

101
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:34,560
He can take it and he can a sort of brick wall against which he gets angry and

102
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:39,540
its getting strength.

103
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:51,720
So I can cope and I think he knows and he can unwind.

104
00:13:51,820 --> 00:14:01,670
What do you think? The amelioration of the child has anything to do with the new love

105
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:06,720
affair that his mother has?

106
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,970
-No.

107
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:15,180
-Who says yes? Who says no?

108
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,140
Both hesitating.

109
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:31,650
If it has, then we are not going to see a relapse.

110
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:38,970
When you see the relapse, then what do you say?

111
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:44,770
Continue the relationship with your lover and he will be all right?

112
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:47,100
It doesnt matter who is the lover.

113
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:52,520
When the child is in the state, he will kick, never mind the lover.

114
00:14:52,620 --> 00:15:04,190
Its in a state in which he cannot resist doing certain things.

115
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:11,140
She explains away all that because it suits her, not the boy.

116
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:20,090
From what I perceive the boy is listening with great concern what its said about him,

117
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:23,350
which he does not agree according to my understanding.

118
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:27,240
I dont think he is agreeing about all that,

119
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:30,210
I do not see a sign of consent of what his mother

120
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:38,170
said. I perceive no sign that he agrees at all.

121
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:47,100
A new lover for his mother but she likes of course the man and she wants to present it

122
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:54,580
in this way and suits her that the child is more calm and she is better in her conscience,

123
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:59,130
so we dont argue with that. Its all right.

124
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:07,830
Though we should argue, though we should say OK, next time he is in relapse, just bring

125
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:17,800
your lover and calm him down or next time you are in relapse drink the water that you said

126
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:25,500
to me you are drinking a particular water, thats why you are better.

127
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,450
And better because my mother is bringing more chocolate.

128
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:36,690
OK when you relapse eat more chocolate and see what happens.

129
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:43,620
Things for me are very clear and I have seen it again and again and again.

130
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:50,000
Ive heard these stories again and again. When I see the relapse I say now what?

131
00:16:50,100 --> 00:17:03,710
The environment is perfect; why he is kicking again?

132
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:15,200
-I can remember it happened on a Friday night. I knew something in him had changed and

133
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,460
I was actually able to present the fact that he wanted to stay at school because he was

134
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:25,430
not making noises about him leaving. Then he was to choose and he couldnt cope, that

135
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:32,390
was fine and he could show them that he could stay.

136
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:38,100
I couldnt have done that a couple of weeks before, he just couldnt handle it and he

137
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:45,610
breaks into tears so I cant do it but I said its all right, it doesnt matter,

138
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,330
if you cant handle

139
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:50,860
it, thats fine.

140
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,850
You see the reaction? Why he didnt react when she says I found a new father who is so

141
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:03,300
nice? Why he doesnt do that when his mother said?

142
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:10,540
This is the story of the mother, not of the child and there is no child that can be attached

143
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:17,360
to a new father after a week. After a week he becomes calm. Well

144
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:23,300
Within a day when he saw him he is in love affair with him, with the lover of his mother.

145
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,100
We dont buy those stories.

146
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:34,100
Unless we understand what is going on...

147
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:46,870
-So how is it now? The teacher said that you are one of the brightest in the class.

148
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:47,950
Do you like it?

149
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:50,210
-Yes.

150
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:58,680
-Are you encouraged by that or it makes no difference to you?

151
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:03,120
-It doesnt make a lot of difference.

152
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,550
You see another intellectualization.

153
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:13,740
Before, the practicionner said, the child needs encouragement and he does not get

154
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,280
enough encouragement and therefore he is like bad and he is behaving like that.

155
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:24,520
Here it is with the best encouragement he can get and the child says, it doesnt matter,

156
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:37,720
it is not so important. You see the intellectualization of things?

157
00:19:51,580 --> 00:20:00,160
Its a phlegmatic kind of reaction. I understand that but the boy that really needs

158
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:08,510
encouragement he will show some reaction. He cannot hold it back.

159
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:15,950
If it is a Pulsatilla boy that needs encouragement, he will not hold it back.

160
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:22,430
You will see the reactions in the child to tell you, yes he really needs encouragement.

161
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:33,010
Here we have a peculiar case, according to me its a unique child with specific qualities.

162
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:42,010
The qualities he has is a kind of wisdom which is much beyond his age.

163
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:52,040
I cannot admit that the remarks of the practitioner in the beginning, the boy needs

164
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:56,970
encouragement, he does not get encouragement and therefore that is why he is behaving

165
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,010
like that

166
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:10,490
This is what Im stating now, I state this was an intellectualization, not the reality.

167
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:16,300
Tell me something else that you notice.

168
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,790
You see how much more frequently he is making that?

169
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:24,530
When I spoke about Stramonium, didnt I tell you?

170
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:32,540
It comes on the periphery and you will see it as a tick.

171
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:43,930
What you see there it can become a strong tick and then come up to that extend.

172
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:46,740
-Are there others?

173
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:58,950
-Yes there are, it is Zinc, Cuprum, Agaricus, different but sort of that kind.

174
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:04,940
It is very little still. There is a small tick. What is this tick?

175
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:15,420
It is a signal which comes from the brain because of some thought.

176
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:23,320
The thought passes and there is a reaction and the reaction does not stay inside.

177
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:29,550
It goes to the peripheral nervous system and makes the tick, that is how more or less we

178
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:32,170
can explain.

179
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:45,260
-He does underplay the praises he gets.

180
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,750
The week weve seen he did a piece of work. We had a strange week because he did a

181
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:58,980
piece of work and he really exploded, he didnt want to do his homework.

182
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:04,720
You see how he listens? With what attention he is listening to what his mother is saying

183
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:10,060
now? She is going to say something which I dont like.

184
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:23,670
He does not have this cut off look, dreamy state; he is more in reality now, here.

185
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:28,640
-He had no supper, he refused to eat, spreading out everything.

186
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:33,620
He sat on the table and started doing his work  without asking of any help at all and

187
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,820
 it was so good

188
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:43,820
If you watch his facial expression

189
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:48,030
The facial expression says, what my mother is going to say now?

190
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:52,520
When he realizes that what she is going to say is not something bad, he relaxes.

191
00:23:52,620 --> 00:24:10,950
He changes. Do you see that? Who sees it? Who does not see it?

192
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:16,900
-The work was very good and when I asked him what the teacher thought of it, he said

193
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:34,240
What the teacher said to me was didnt I tell you how marvelous this work was?

194
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:42,950
-How do you feel in yourself? Can you tell us?

195
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:50,930
Why you dont get angry now? Do you feel that you try to restrain yourself or anger does

196
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:54,780
not come as easily as it used to?

197
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,250
-It does not come as easily as it used to.

198
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:01,150
-You dont want to explode now.

199
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:06,080
-Not always.

200
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:11,070
-Do you restrain yourself at all if anger comes?

201
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:15,570
-Sometimes yes.

202
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:23,790
-The last time you exploded, you couldnt restrain, six weeks ago?

203
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:33,030
-He was exploding regularly; he cant handle the change, so coming to London.

204
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:39,220
It used to leave two hours later and sometimes more because he would do everything to

205
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:45,670
stop this going. This time we were about three quarters late and this was partly because

206
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:49,980
my back was been diseased and I was kind of slow.

207
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:56,810
You did get angry, you said you didnt want to go and you kicked the door and you

208
00:25:56,910 --> 00:26:03,050
threw a few things but it isnt as bad as it was.

209
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:22,300
Its still much more anger than his brother, I think its more anger than a normal child.

210
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,510
-The migraines that he used to have did not return? He did not complain of any

211
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:28,770
headaches.

212
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:33,580
-No.

213
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:38,130
-And neither he will wake up in terror or something

214
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:54,190
-No.

215
00:26:55,450 --> 00:27:01,110
I think its enough. What is important is from the state where the teachers called the

216
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:07,820
mother and father and say the child has to leave the school, cannot stay in the school, to

217
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:12,320
another statement which says this is one of the brightest students.

218
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:27,510
That is a difference within a space of two months.

219
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:30,260
A year later he had a relapse.

220
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:43,870
He got again Stramonium and well see now how he is going.

221
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:58,840
The mother knows very well the situation and when she will see the situation coming

222
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:06,550
back, then she will tell.

223
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:21,270
-between the mother and the child sensation of isolation?

224
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:27,440
-I cant see that very clearly. Maybe what you are saying is correct but what I see is the

225
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:34,100
child is also cut off from everyone, not only from his mother.

226
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:40,940
There is a cut off feeling in the child that he lives in his own world.

227
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:47,780
Therefore what you say is correct but it applies also to others, therefore I cannot really say

228
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:53,600
at this stage, whether there is a cut off feeling with the mother and taking it into

229
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:57,330
consideration very seriously.

230
00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:07,120
In such cases we will see the real results in 3-4 years after the remedy.

231
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:12,800
When this child will have become a child that will go into another rhythm of working, all

232
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:30,510
together. Its a matter of adjusting to new situations which come from the inside and

233
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:42,510
undertaking responsibilities, undertaking ambitions to be realized, undertaking emotional

234
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:51,510
contracts we have with each other. The mother wants me to do this and I have to do that.

235
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:56,210
When you are in a state of Stramonium, you dont care about these things, you dont think

236
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,190
about responsibility.

237
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:04,210
What you think is, your energy has increased, your mind is going completely bizarre and

238
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,300
you just hit.

239
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:15,430
From that state to go into all other conditions where we have a human being which is very

240
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:27,180
creative within the society, it takes long time.

241
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:35,930
This interview is I think on February and the original was on October?

242
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:38,930
Do we have the dates?

243
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:47,030
-Five months.

244
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:04,890
-Do we have another follow up?

245
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:21,160
-This is eight months after the original case. There is another one.

246
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:26,140
-Lets see it.

247
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:31,610
-We just happened to meet at the station.

248
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:43,070
-Can you tell me what happened since that time?

249
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:49,740
-Its a big change. A lot of different things happened to his life, he changed school.

250
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,740
-He has?

251
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:59,480
-He has. And he likes it. At the beginning of the autumn I knew that I was getting ready to

252
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:14,640
change and he suddenly was ready to do it, moving from a school of 200 to a school of

253
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:19,940
500 children and he is much more confident.

254
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:25,000
In fact he is taking the change easier than his little brother.

255
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:33,200
This school now is a regular school where there is no special at all methods.

256
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:44,900
-No problems apart from homework because he still finds difficult to face stuff which he

257
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:58,080
hasnt met before. He doesnt feel confident about. He was initially getting angry about it

258
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:03,810
-The work is different from the work he was doing?

259
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:09,050
-It is different yes and some of it he is so frightened about that he put up the rest.

260
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:15,550
He stated it quite clearly last week that

261
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:19,480
he was not feeling very well but not on the school

262
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:24,730
 He wouldnt miss the slightest opportunity.

263
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:30,460
Usually in the autumn he gets very tired

264
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,440
What is important here, Im not going to miss school. A child like saying Im not going to

265
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:39,350
miss school in spite of the fact Im not prepared, its great.

266
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:54,910
Once he will go to Stramonium state, forget it, he will just say, Im not going.

267
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:59,160
-and by this time he is like I cant cope and

268
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:04,490
this is the first autumn for many years that he is not going down.

269
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:06,500
- Is he actually doing his homework?

270
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:12,750
- Yes. He has been kept a couple of times because he hasnt done things.

271
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:15,720
I think he chooses to forget, occasionally.

272
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:21,460
Hes still not feeling to get hit on but much less so.

273
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:26,200
-How does he react if he has to stay at home?

274
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,960
-Not bothered, which is surprising.

275
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:33,000
-And what about leaving his own school, how does he feel about that?

276
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:37,760
-Very relieved because by the end the relationship with his teacher

277
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:40,600
was getting very difficult.

278
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:48,340
 His teacher began more and more and its a man who had a huge ego and

279
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:55,320
its very exciting to be with but you had to love him and we didnt love him.

280
00:34:55,420 --> 00:35:05,790
When he went to a school camp, he still couldnt handle be expected to be part of the

281
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:08,770
group all the time and

282
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:24,270
He became very tired and he went to bed which offended his teacher enormously

283
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:31,250
because his teacher did a story telling every night and he was going to miss it.

284
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:36,410
By the time the teacher said about this at the end of the report, I was so angry because it

285
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:41,900
was trying to make him improve his behavior by making him guilty and

286
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,920
I knew thought it very hard to get him away from that school because it was very important to

287
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:50,620
get him away from that teacher.

288
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,780
-So it was the right time. How is he settled with his new class?

289
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:59,540
-He seems to be fine. Initially he didnt get new friends but in fact today when I pick him

290
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:07,780
up from school, he was friend with another child from the class and hes been hit and

291
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:16,270
the boy get to me and apologized; he said I want to make it clear. It was wonderful to see and

292
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:22,240
the boys get contact and they are good friends now.

293
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:39,400
-How is his behavior at school? Have you spoken to anybody?

294
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,370
Lets talk about something which is not in the case.

295
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:55,240
Why do you think the boy had a clash with his teacher?

296
00:36:55,340 --> 00:37:05,360
The teacher seemed to have some kind of dislike for the boy and the boy had some kind

297
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:12,130
of dislike for the teacher. Can you imagine why is that?

298
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:17,860
-He is more intelligent.

299
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:23,530
-You can say he is more intelligent but the fact remains. The teacher if he really is an

300
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:31,560
egotistical person full of himself, he perceives that that child is a challenge.

301
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:38,370
Especially when the child will sit back and very quietly make a remark, which is very

302
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:46,130
acute, very sharp. He does not like it.

303
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:55,080
How the human element enters into a relationship and a misunderstanding comes and

304
00:37:55,180 --> 00:38:04,800
there comes the fighting; it is just misunderstanding.

305
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:15,200
The teacher is not threatened, the teacher is responsible for bringing out more of his

306
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:25,180
genius, whatever it is. Yes, continue. You have a genius, he cannot say that and the child

307
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,270
leaves.

308
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:36,930
- And his behavior at the school?

309
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:44,600
-I spoke to a special needs school and they said they keep an eye on him and having

310
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:56,080
read what the school report and things about the fact and they considered to give him an

311
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:01,030
extra lesson, painting and major stuff like that.

312
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:07,740
They talked him and said no I didnt want to get behind and he is doing fine and

313
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:13,740
 although all the teachers are aware...

314
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:25,240
-He seems to be more tight. Its got more order to it but its still very tight writing.

315
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:31,500
-What about at home? How is his behavior at home?

316
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:38,680
- It also occurs to me. Also I should give you an idea that

317
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:43,430
the hand writing it may depict to different remedies.

318
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:52,890
Perhaps for those who understand graphology, we may have an idea of the remedies by

319
00:39:52,990 --> 00:40:00,870
different ways. One of the way it might be a sampling of finding the common features

320
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:06,610
between Calcarea carbonicas or Nux vomicas or Stramonium but especially among those

321
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:12,190
people who are mentally disturbed.

322
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:18,200
So she describes a kind of writing for him, which is interesting to have in mind and try to

323
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:29,450
see whether other Stramonium children have the same type of writing.

324
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:38,430
-He is growing up, he definitely is and Im engaged to someone who I first got involved

325
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:48,640
shortly after we came here, that was in February. And he somehow helped me with the children

326
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:58,590
 it was Christmas in fact and he has been looking for a father figure and

327
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:13,090
he has found one. They do have rows but this was fine because within minutes its all forgiven

328
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:16,590
-And so the relationship between you and him?

329
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:24,590
-It is much more relaxed. Hes being more responsible. He still cant be generous except

330
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:29,340
when he is feeling very confident.

331
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:35,340
He still only point out that, you know I have back problem, if my back is bad,

332
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:42,840
suggest him to do but he will eventually do it, while before he wouldnt.

333
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:48,430
He would create such a scene if I went down. Now I can go down and he is OK.

334
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:54,160
- Has he been violent towards you? Because a lot times he has been hurting you

335
00:41:54,260 --> 00:42:05,890
-Hardly at all. He does little things and I explain thats really hurts and would you like

336
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:11,130
me to do it to you and thats it. He finishes it.

337
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:21,050
-What about the kicks? How does he behave afterwards? Is he sorry?

338
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:27,520
-He hasnt come to that yet.

339
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:31,220
It was a day that he was very angry and I told him something to do, he forgotten, he

340
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:37,200
didnt want to do it, he went upstairs and he kicks the door very hard.

341
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:46,670
And  when he came down, I said put the books back and he did it,

342
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:53,680
which again it wouldnt have done it six months ago.

343
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:57,650
-Good. What about his sleep? How is that?

344
00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:04,860
-That is better and it seems that he is not waking up every morning. He is tired but its not

345
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:13,090
that very heavy I cant face it. In fact sometimes he is up already before I go to wake him.

346
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:15,940
-Really and he stays in bed?

347
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:19,640
-Yes he just lies there.

348
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:25,880
-And you have to go and touch him to get him up

349
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:34,210
-He got the point when I said

350
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:40,460
-And that worked. Generally he sleeps without disturbing at night?

351
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,210
-He is not anymore.

352
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:50,470
There is one symptom, the way that the mother describes that the boy wakes up in the

353
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:55,810
morning, which says unrefreshed, you will find it...

354
00:43:55,910 --> 00:44:10,540
It is not recorded with the Stramonium, unrefreshed sleep.

355
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:17,870
But Stramonium has it. So you will see many times it does not have that symptom.

356
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:21,340
It is not recorded, it does not mean that the remedy does not have that symptom.

357
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:26,520
It has not been recorded.

358
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:41,250
The child used to be very unrefreshed. I cant This kind of description.

359
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:46,740
-And he goes to bed early?

360
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:53,240
-In fact when he goes to bed at night I read and while I read hisis on the

361
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:59,500
floor but he is so brilliant, he is doing something.

362
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:07,240
Eventually when I finish the story I want him to be in bed but its not very big resistance,

363
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:10,210
its like more like the average child.

364
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:13,780
-What about the relationship with the other children?

365
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:20,730
-There are times where he has been difficult and Matthew felt that he couldnt

366
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:25,950
take anymore. Certainly last year I was having to have Matthew in one side, I was

367
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:37,600
saying you must give him space, I try to keep them separately

368
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:26,870
-Perhaps, I do not know if that eventually will go away or will change.

369
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:39,690
We may say this is a strict of Stramonium.

370
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:52,030
-Do you think this child will grow up and be a Stramonium all of his life?

371
00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:57,770
-Thats a good question. Whether this is what we call constitutional Stramonium or

372
00:46:57,870 --> 00:47:04,500
whether Stramonium was printed upon him, as a second remedy.

373
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:09,930
I believe that Stramonium in this case is quite deep.

374
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:23,840
I believe that maybe for years he will be under the influence of Stramonium and perhaps

375
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:32,630
he will develop another remedy but quite later. It is not just one time Stramonium.

376
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:37,610
-The other remedy was present in both and we just remove it away once again?

377
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:41,840
-Right but Im not sure whether he was born Stramonium really, the first remedy was

378
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:48,660
Stramonium or with the first fright he became Stramonium.

379
00:47:52,940 --> 00:48:00,820
What is very interesting in this case, the most interesting part for me was the fact that for

380
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:06,900
a certain period of years, he was a Stramonium with different symptomatology than after

381
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,240
these years.

382
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:16,020
In the beginning you remember fear of the dark, waking in fright, shouting, dreaming,

383
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:26,760
having all these night things happening to him, these they subsided and the violence

384
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:34,210
started and the child started kicking and doing violent things.

385
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:40,690
So we see how the remedy develops in stages.

386
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:46,430
We do not always find the violence in Stramonium, as I have said, but you may see it in a

387
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:48,590
night terror.

388
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:55,650
If the child was brought to me at the age of 1,5 I would have prescribed Stramonium.

389
00:48:55,750 --> 00:49:01,120
And the child definitely would have been spared everything of what is going on, the child

390
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:04,000
would be a normal child.

391
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:12,890
It is much more easy to cure a small child than curing somebody who is 14 years in that

392
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:14,230
state.

393
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:25,650
Dont forget; you remember I asked him a question and I said, how do you feel in the first

394
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:27,640
interview?

395
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:34,610
He said Im feeling calm. I said to him is this a good feeling or a bad feeling?

396
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:38,090
And he says in between.

397
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:45,630
What the child is living, he is living a hell.

398
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:53,850
When you will have lifted him, its like taking him from hell, out.

399
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:58,820
Dont get the idea that he is calm but what is calm?

400
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:10,930
It is like a lake which you have fire underneath, great fire and at a certain point its going

401
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:15,420
to boil and its going to be like a volcano.

402
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:21,160
Its like this surface calmness, which feeds underneath the volcano.

403
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:25,890
The volcano is there all the time, the possibility of explosion is there all the time.

404
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:32,470
That is a feeling and thats why he says good feeling being calm? No.

405
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:41,120
I remember a case of Ignatia, a severe chorea case since childhood.

406
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:49,330
She came and we prescribed Ignatia and after 1-2 months she rushed unexpectedly into

407
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:55,060
the office, she says I must talk to you.

408
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:59,310
All the rooms were filled, so I take her to the kitchen.

409
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:05,550
The kitchen was for special consultation. Roger knows.

410
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:11,310
Special consultations where ministers were coming and I would say do you mind if I take

411
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:15,830
your case in the kitchen? No, we dont mind.

412
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:20,570
That was the spare room, where I used to do my consultations.

413
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:25,830
Otherwise I was inside the other rooms but no room for me.

414
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:34,680
She comes into the kitchen and she tells me there is something Im frightened about and

415
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:37,070
I said what it is?

416
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:48,550
She says I feel calm.

417
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:54,140
I couldnt understand in the beginning.

418
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,870
I said is this a good feeling or a bad feeling?

419
00:51:56,970 --> 00:51:59,140
She says its a good feeling.

420
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:05,090
So why you are afraid? Because I never felt like that again before.

421
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:11,880
She has never in her life felt what is to be calm.

422
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:16,640
That experience Im calm again the next day Im calm...

423
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:26,130
What is this? It must be something which is unhealthy.

424
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:31,640
This boy has lived from the age of one into that state. It s not going to come out from one

425
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:35,890
day to the other, out.

426
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:48,240
It should have been one more follow up one and a half year later where his mother will

427
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:54,650
describe a kind of relapse.

428
00:52:54,750 --> 00:53:15,930
This is the last follow up which I have so far. The last follow up from Stramonium.

429
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:04,890
-What happened since then?

430
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:11,750
-About March-April I think the pressure of what was expected from the school started to

431
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:18,210
come into surface; he couldnt keep up the pressure of work, he didnt want to take

432
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:21,430
responsibility for homework.

433
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:31,390
We were having battles at home and there was particular weekends and its got very

434
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:41,170
difficult. He was getting more angry at home and when I went to a parents meeting

435
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:51,440
You see what is happening? First he doesnt want to take responsibility.

436
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:58,100
You see where he breaks down, he does not want to take responsibility anymore.

437
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:01,870
Then the second thing he becomes more angry in the house.

438
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:10,890
But in the house he was so nice. Now why?

439
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:17,920
-I realized that he wasnt asking for help at school, he was hiding

440
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:23,140
a back roll, trying to avoid the problem to a certain extend and

441
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:28,140
the teacher said it wasnt that he was lacking intelligence,

442
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:33,220
it was that somewhere on the line he wasnt connecting it

443
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:38,240
-So he found it very difficult?

444
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:39,830
-Yes.

445
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:43,490
-You were not doing the work because it was difficult?

446
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:44,990
-Yes.

447
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:47,720
-And you had changed schools, havent you?

448
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:48,970
-Yes.

449
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:58,420
-How long by this time? Are you enjoying the school?

450
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:01,360
-Yes.

451
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:12,190
-I decided I will do call a social work and I described what was happening and it took 3-4

452
00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:16,600
weeks because people had gone away, it was Easter.

453
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:20,860
Finally they put me in touch with the child-psychiatrist,

454
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,110
he is specialized in adolescence and he said he wanted to see him.

455
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:27,610
That was in April. Has been seeing him once a month since.

456
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:32,320
-What was happening at home then with the anger?

457
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:44,160
-I found [?] He was resisting any obligations that he didnt want to face.

458
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:53,090
He was resisting any obligations. You see how the relapse starts?

459
00:56:58,670 --> 00:57:04,310
They have a report from previous school and they say this is a problematic child and in

460
00:57:04,410 --> 00:57:06,050
the school they know this is a problematic child.

461
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:13,000
So they advise the parents to find a social worker.

462
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:26,420
Is the social worker going to work with the Stramonium? Good luck.

463
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:33,250
-He was doing anything, door slamming... Everything required a lot of work just to make

464
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:38,000
him face getting on with a task that he had to get on with.

465
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:40,970
-You were aware of this behavior?

466
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:42,490
-Yes.

467
00:57:42,590 --> 00:57:49,170
-What spark was for that behavior? Why you are doing it?

468
00:57:49,270 --> 00:58:01,920
-Things are that I cant do them. I want to do something else.

469
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:06,720
-So you are not being allowed to do what you wanted to. Its only that?

470
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:08,960
-I dont know.

471
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:12,470
-What are the things that you are not allowed to do?

472
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:22,540
-Use computer and my electromagnetics.

473
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:27,770
-When you were prevented from doing something that you feel you should be able to do,

474
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:35,260
how do you feel? How does it make you feel like?

475
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:40,290
-I feel like hitting.

476
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:42,830
-Does this make you feel better?

477
00:58:42,930 --> 00:58:45,580
-Yes.

478
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:50,270
-And afterwards how do you feel if you have done this?

479
00:58:50,370 --> 00:58:53,540
-I cant remember.

480
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:58,100
-You dont remember how you feel or you dont remember what you have done?

481
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:01,580
-I dont remember how I feel.

482
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:11,340
-There has been changed since I phoned you and I wondered about whether to come because

483
00:59:12,270 --> 00:59:13,170
 I see the progression but the psychiatrist thought it would be a good idea if we came.

484
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:20,290
- What sort of ground has he been covering

485
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:31,500
- Certainly when we were talking together he was talking about complete

486
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:38,900
dependence on me and his total inability to take it on himself.

487
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:45,740
You see once the relapse starts, you see the chaos, the intellectualization, the

488
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:48,750
explanations that are going to be given?

489
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:55,720
Everything was fine from September until April he goes to school, he takes responsibility,

490
00:59:55,820 --> 01:00:01,800
he even says even Im not prepared I go and suddenly now he does not take

491
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:09,560
responsibility, he becomes more angry, his teachers are annoyed and the psychiatrist

492
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:17,630
says there is a big dependence of the child to the mother.

493
01:00:17,730 --> 01:00:20,980
What shall we do about that and blah, blah, blah.

494
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:23,990
All right the blah, blah, blah but I would like to see the effect.

495
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:31,700
Eventually give him Aloperidin to sedate him finally.

496
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:40,750
This is the usual story with such children.

497
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:48,330
Why now he is in relapse? Why the lover of the mother cannot balance the child?

498
01:00:48,430 --> 01:00:52,600
He is still there, he still loves the child very much.

499
01:00:52,700 --> 01:01:02,320
It doesnt matter. These stages are not so superficial; there are other stages that are

500
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:09,650
superficial stages but not these conditions.

501
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:20,890
-This is going to be a slow process to get him to take responsibility.

502
01:01:20,990 --> 01:01:26,130
This is going to be a slow process to make him again take responsibility.

503
01:01:26,230 --> 01:01:34,050
It was not slow when he was given the homeopathic remedy, he took it immediately.

504
01:01:34,150 --> 01:01:39,290
He is going into a kind of relapse. Am I going to give him a remedy or not?

505
01:01:39,390 --> 01:01:45,770
That is the main question.

506
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:50,520
Definitely the child is going to a kind of relapse.

507
01:01:50,620 --> 01:02:05,270
The best policy will be to wait, as much as possible, to see whether this relapse by itself

508
01:02:05,370 --> 01:02:11,880
is going to correct itself and may come up.

509
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:16,590
How long you will wait? What you do?

510
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:27,810
You ask how much is the same as the original state? Definitely if its the same as the

511
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:32,750
original state a month, you give it, no question.

512
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:38,760
If the mother hesitates at different points, its better to wait until you have

513
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:41,760
 a full relapse.

514
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:46,510
The best thing to wait, is he going definitely towards Stramonium?

515
01:02:46,610 --> 01:02:54,280
Most probably there is no question, the anger but maybe the anger is so much and there

516
01:02:54,380 --> 01:03:03,470
are other changes in the boy that may indicate another remedy, not in this case.

517
01:03:03,570 --> 01:03:09,990
But in another case you may still see the anger but there are other changes that will be

518
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:18,730
indicated but now the case is going into Hyoscyamus or to Belladonna or to Pulsatilla, it

519
01:03:18,830 --> 01:03:19,870
doesnt matter.

520
01:03:24,170 --> 01:03:30,320
But this boy is going towards Stramonium, you will not perceive changes.

521
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:40,070
My suggestion at that point to the practicionner who takes the case is wait a little bit

522
01:03:40,170 --> 01:03:45,790
further and then repeat the initial remedy.

523
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:50,790
He is going to be in that kind of relapse I believe before he goes out of Stramonium, he is

524
01:03:50,890 --> 01:04:02,290
going to be 2 or 3 times more and this can be within a period of 4 to 5 years and then

525
01:04:02,390 --> 01:04:09,000
eventually he is steady on that remedy and then perhaps the next remedy may appear,

526
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:12,750
which will be great.

527
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:16,530
-How many weeks would you wait in this state?

528
01:04:16,630 --> 01:04:27,720
-I would still wait another month.

529
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:31,220
-There is a danger here.

530
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:39,210
-Yes you are correct. The psychiatrists will say whatever. If people do not understand

531
01:04:39,310 --> 01:04:48,570
what we are trying to do, they are deserving their fate but to change your principles

532
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:52,790
and your understanding because you will lose the patient, this is the wrong way of thinking

533
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:59,540
and you should never do it for this reason.

534
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:03,290
You may do it also because you are concerned about the child, its is going to be lost.

535
01:05:03,390 --> 01:05:06,280
Then you explain.

536
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:16,050
You say this is my understanding that if the child takes sedatives, it will go into much

537
01:05:16,150 --> 01:05:23,800
worse state. This child after six months of sedatives, he will go to tremendous

538
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:32,020
 aggravation. It will go crazy.

539
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:34,530
-The initial potency?

540
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:40,740
-The initial potency 10M you repeat it and then you go higher.

541
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:48,980
-What would happen if you give the remedy too early?

542
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:54,980
-Most probably it would aggravate the situation, the child would keep on in Stramonium

543
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:59,730
and perhaps one day the mother will come and say he has broken all the glasses in the

544
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:09,600
house. He will be facing all the situation quite violent.

545
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:12,340
-For a long period?

546
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:18,850
-Not for a long period perhaps but it will aggravate for one month, two, three months even

547
01:06:18,950 --> 01:06:21,680
it will aggravate the situation.

548
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:27,180
Then you will have to pass judgment to know whether you should again give another

549
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:30,430
potency, which is higher than the previous.

550
01:06:30,530 --> 01:06:36,750
We gave two times 10M, we go to 50M now, during the aggravation, when the picture is

551
01:06:36,850 --> 01:06:41,590
really very strong.

552
01:06:41,690 --> 01:06:46,340
You gave by mistake and you relapsed your case completely. Now that is the time you

553
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:54,330
can go on a higher potency and give it again and this will antidote the whole situation.

554
01:06:54,430 --> 01:07:00,260
So far what we used to do is wrong remedy, go to another remedy.

555
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:03,750
You gave Stramonium, it was worse with Stramonium.

556
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:08,010
And you never think of giving Stramonium again at this situation.

557
01:07:08,110 --> 01:07:13,230
Its not the case of Tuberculinum that. Do you see the difference?

558
01:07:13,330 --> 01:07:17,980
Here you know that this is the remedy that has acted and this is the remedy which

559
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:22,240
aggravated and brought about a relapse.

560
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:27,220
Then you go higher and you give it. Do you understand?

561
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:32,700
Is anybody who does not understand? Please tell me I did not understand.

562
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:36,690
Otherwise you just wasted your time, effort, money.

563
01:07:36,790 --> 01:07:41,700
-I think

564
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:55,710
-Im talking about if Phosphorus was your right remedy; it was not your right remedy.

565
01:07:55,810 --> 01:08:01,820
Therefore its not going to act, its not going to do anything.

566
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:10,540
If the remedy is the correct, Stramonium and you repeat it untimely, too early, you

567
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:15,770
aggravate the case because still it is Stramonium.

568
01:08:15,870 --> 01:08:21,490
When the case is aggravated then you give it in higher potency, then you have results.

569
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:28,970
If the remedy was the wrong remedy and you repeat it, you have an aggravation, you

570
01:08:29,070 --> 01:08:33,680
augment the aggravation.

571
01:08:33,780 --> 01:08:36,760
-You might do the repetition during the aggravation?

572
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:43,260
-Even during the aggravation. You wait to see first if its going to act the remedy, maybe

573
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:47,750
its an aggravation and after a week the child is going to be better.

574
01:08:47,850 --> 01:08:54,240
You wait for a week, two, three weeks, no effect, four, five weeks its doing worse, worse,

575
01:08:54,340 --> 01:09:00,490
then you give it.

576
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:12,010
These cases I hope if we had a hospital, we could show this kind of severe cases where

577
01:09:12,110 --> 01:09:18,990
there is life threatening and we could demonstrate what we have to do.

578
01:09:19,090 --> 01:09:28,960
-When you give Stramonium too early and you have an aggravation, then you give

579
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:31,710
Stramonium once more?

580
01:09:31,810 --> 01:09:36,920
-During the aggravation of the second repetition.

581
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:39,170
-The third time?

582
01:09:39,270 --> 01:09:47,410
-On higher potency, as long as you wait enough on the second remedy to see whether

583
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:50,280
its going to be curative.

584
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:56,380
You know, you have the experience already. We gave a remedy, he was a little bit

585
01:09:57,130 --> 01:10:02,030
disturbed for one week; after the week he started settling down. So you have this

586
01:10:02,130 --> 01:10:03,540
experience.

587
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:08,260
The second time you do not expect that he will have an aggravation on one month.

588
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:15,220
If you see the aggravation is continuing, that means you brought about full relapse.

589
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:23,020
Then give a higher potency.

590
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:26,020
-Do you think it will be any  for repeating in a low potency?

591
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:28,530
-In a low potency we try sometimes.

592
01:10:28,630 --> 01:10:33,990
There is another possibility, if the relapse is not really great and still you feel it is quite

593
01:10:34,090 --> 01:10:38,070
strong the relapse, you may repeat instead of high potency,

594
01:10:38,170 --> 01:10:42,070
you may repeat a few doses of low potency.

595
01:10:42,170 --> 01:10:48,560
Let us say Stramonium 12C. You give it for 10-15 days and see what happens, whether

596
01:10:48,660 --> 01:11:03,320
this low stimulation, brings about a balance.

597
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:13,310
More or less, we cannot judge exactly what is happening because we do not have the

598
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:14,410
measures.

599
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:32,960
You may. Most of the times the aggravation is less than the first time.

600
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:42,720
When you repeat it timely, the aggravation is less than the first time because definitely the

601
01:11:42,820 --> 01:11:54,070
first remedy has lifted some of the heaviness of the case.

602
01:11:54,840 --> 01:12:03,510
I would like to make a remark now concerning Stramonium.

603
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:14,450
I would say that I find Stramonium in late years much more indicated than my first years of

604
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:17,720
practice.

605
01:12:17,820 --> 01:12:29,440
I dont know whether I learned to recognize it more easily or whether there is really a

606
01:12:29,540 --> 01:12:42,200
development of aggressiveness in our societies and we have the appearance of more and

607
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:49,180
more of such remedies as Stramonium, Hyoscyamus, Nux vomicas.

608
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,930
You see the Nux vomicas were always very prominent.

609
01:12:52,030 --> 01:13:03,600
The aggression that creates problems in the human body were taken away mostly by

610
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:05,090
Nux vomica.

611
01:13:05,190 --> 01:13:13,080
Today we have much more aggressive remedies being indicated and also we have

612
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:33,730
remedies which cover pictures of drug abuse.

613
01:13:46,710 --> 01:13:55,010
Also what I want to show you again is the time that you have to wait.

614
01:13:55,110 --> 01:14:02,230
Remember, Bill Gray left his cases for two years, he returned and found all of them cured.

615
01:14:02,330 --> 01:14:07,970
Maybe its a little bit of exaggeration in that but just stick that into your mind.

616
01:14:08,070 --> 01:14:12,970
You gave a good remedy, there was a good reaction, leave it alone.

617
01:14:13,070 --> 01:14:18,930
Dont repeat it, dont give other remedies. This is the idea.
