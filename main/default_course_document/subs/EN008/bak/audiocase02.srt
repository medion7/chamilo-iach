1
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:30,240
This seems to be a quite deep, there is a hard mass very painful?

2
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,260
-Yes.

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:51,590
-Quite big, about 3 cm big.
-It became worse by the evening.

4
00:00:52,720 --> 00:01:01,170
-When did she develop this?
-She had it for about 8 years.

5
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:20,910
-What you see there it is for 8 years, this tremendous boil inside.

6
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,000
Did you see the color?

7
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:40,890
The color now it's not blackish but it is towards that.

8
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:58,320
What happens is that he squeezed it and aggravated it and created a lot of pain.

9
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:06,120
That's why he brings the case, he is an American practitioner and this is his wife

10
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,960
and he brought the case because of tremendous pain.

11
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:15,810
The woman can not sleep because of tremendous pain. Burning pain.

12
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:24,730
And we are called now to treat this boil.

13
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:36,460
In such a case if you do not find the remedy, what might happen is a little bit you

14
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,080
ameliorate the pain.

15
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:48,320
You can give Sulphur in this case or you can give Lachesis, what she will say is that

16
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,800
the pain for 1-2 days was less and then it came back and then you give Sulphur.

17
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,310
But nothing substantial.

18
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:09,800
The thing is not something that came 8 months ago, it's 8 years.

19
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,560
Did you find the follow up?

20
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:34,460
What happened is that I stayed in the United States for 5 weeks.

21
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:43,610
This case I have seen it the second week, so there are several follow ups, 2 days later on,

22
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:47,610
7 days later on by her husband.

23
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:58,220
He gives the follow up and eventually she comes herself about 3 weeks, after 18 or 20 days.

24
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:22,530
It's a pity, it's a pity, I hope he will find the 3 week follow up

25
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,550
and you will see where this boil is.

26
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,700
Let us hear a little bit the story because through this story,

27
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,300
you are learning a new remedy, Anthracinum.

28
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:59,710
-I squeezed out quite a bit offensive smelling, white sebaceous matter.

29
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:01,980
-What smell?

30
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:08,390
-It smelled like very strong cheese, offensive.

31
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:18,380
You see it smelled like strong cheese, listen now why I did not give Hepar sulphur.

32
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:27,800
This is the smell of Hepar sulphur, why not giving Hepar sulphur?

33
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,870
It is very important.

34
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:49,460
And also the fact that it smells very badly, it shows perhaps a process which is quite severe.

35
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:08,170
- It smelled like very strong cheese, offensive.

36
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:14,370
But from what I've seen in other sebaceous cases it's exactly the same smell.

37
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:20,620
Then the next day again it was still... always it would be something oozing,

38
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:28,200
so I squeezed it and it became about 30% of the size that ordinarily is.

39
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,540
This is roughly the size than ordinarily is.

40
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:37,720
-Like that all the time for the last 8 years?
-Yes.

41
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:45,450
-And this redness was always there?
-No, never discoloration, never pain.

42
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,210
-Now there is an information.

43
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:58,360
-So it was painful the second day, so we decided to leave it alone but it was small.

44
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,450
I could feel all the context of the cyst.

45
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:10,420
Then we didn't touch it and slowly over the next 3 days, she was not feeling well.

46
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,720
-It was still oozing then.

47
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:27,450
-Then what happened was by Wednesday morning, she was having a headache,

48
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:35,700
she couldn't make any decisions, she was dying for open air and had a feeling that

49
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,630
she wanted to go outside in the cold.

50
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:49,620
-At 7 in the morning when it was really cold and I felt the cold great, wanting to cry.

51
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,960
-Emotional, so I gave a dose of Pulsatilla 1M.

52
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:03,200
What this case will be teaching us eventually will be that Anthracinum

53
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:15,620
in its mental picture it is quite like Pulsatilla. That's one lesson. What is Pulsatilla?

54
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:24,420
It wants to cry, it wants window open but she will feel more the cold.

55
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:31,620
In the reaction she was having eventually, you will see other symptoms coming up

56
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:37,800
which are very interesting and which look like symptoms of Natrum muriaticum.

57
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:55,050
But you see the dullness of the mind, the difficulty to make decisions?

58
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:14,950
-I gave one dose of Pulsatilla has done good work for her in the past

59
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:19,800
and within a half hour she was...

60
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:27,960
-I didn't have a headache or stomach ache, I was in charge, I wasn't emotionally dispersed.

61
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,450
Another lesson we have to learn.

62
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:38,110
What he says is, Pulsatilla has been working for her all these years.

63
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:43,720
He is giving Pulsatilla and something was happening. She was feeling better all the time.

64
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:56,110
It brings about some kind of amelioration with a remedy which is similar

65
00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:03,550
but not the Similimum, which is the exact remedy that we need to give.

66
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:15,870
And why this case was treated for 10 years with Homeopathy and no deep changes

67
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:19,890
but still she kept on with her life?

68
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:26,720
Because we don't know enough of the picture of Anthracinum.

69
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:40,450
The heart mass, the picture of Pulsatilla, the desire for open air,

70
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:46,150
the headaches that are associated with this and also the indecision

71
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:50,960
come to form a picture of another remedy.

72
00:10:51,060 --> 00:11:17,550
And you will see other symptoms as well.
-It started getting red, painful, hot.

73
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:28,130
It reminds me of an animal, here I am.

74
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:38,070
Did you hear the intensity? She said it feels like being in a fire, like an animal.

75
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:49,450
The animals they stand, to make a mark on the animals and she feels that feeling.

76
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,470
Both they described the pain.

77
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:03,200
The intensity of the pain will become also characteristic of this case in order

78
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,300
to decide one remedy or another.

79
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:15,620
If she was Hepar sulphur, would she say desire open air? No.

80
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,140
Hepar sulphur likes to be warm.

81
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:29,120
The burning pain is it characteristic of Hepar sulphur? Not so much.

82
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:34,550
It is Arsenicum, it's Anthracinum but not so much Hepar sulphur.

83
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:46,210
It was a difficult case, don't think that this case is easy.

84
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,070
George saw the case and gave her Anthracinum?

85
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:54,710
No, it took a long process of thinking before I concluded on this remedy

86
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:01,380
but because the remedy was correct, you will see the effect.

87
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:20,000
-She is not sleeping well, anybody who touches it...

88
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,290
-Do you feel cold?
-No.

89
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:29,040
-It still feels warm?
-It feels warm, no other way.

90
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:34,700
-Emotionally I feel much better than when this was draining.

91
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:43,950
By evening it hurts all the way and down and there and then when I lay down

92
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:50,460
for the night it feels the best, when I lay down for hours it feels the best.

93
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,810
-Although the sleep is not really good.

94
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:22,890
-Any other symptom?
-Just it's always hot and burning.

95
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:31,220
It comes in waves, sometimes it feels really hot and then others it just aches.

96
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:38,390
She says it comes in waves, that points out to another remedy which is...

97
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:58,640
Pain comes in waves and with this color which is bluish black and bluish red

98
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,550
the remedy is Lachesis.

99
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:24,300
-Just it's always hot and burning.

100
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:32,000
It comes in waves, sometimes it feels really hot and then others it just aches.

101
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:07,700
-Do you have any anemia?
-Yes, she is pregnant now.

102
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:14,040
-She is always anemic?
-No.

103
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:29,280
-But actually this is her third pregnancy and it's the best pregnancy by far.

104
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,800
With good homeopathic treatment.

105
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:44,540
-I did go to India recently, came down with hepatitis, not yellow eyes

106
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:53,890
but itching all over, terrible itching.

107
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,890
And that was 80%.

108
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:18,290
-She has a new remedy between Dolichos and the Pulsatilla, that was 2 months ago.

109
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:30,940
She was more anemic in the last pregnancies her hematocrit is 34,

110
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:41,880
she would be around 29 or 30 in prior pregnancies, so for her it's probably reasoned.

111
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,800
Do you have the analysis?

112
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:09,790
There was a discussion in the class and I would like to show you the discussion that took

113
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:17,630
place and I decided on Anthracinum.

114
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:24,880
Do you have the fist follow up?

115
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:31,130
It is her husband talking about the case 2 days later after Anthracinum.

116
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:50,200
With Pulsatilla she says it's stopped discharging but the pain was much greater.

117
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:56,280
When she came the pain was excruciating. The husband told me she is very patient,

118
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:00,030
she can stand a lot of pain and because she is not shouting,

119
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:05,050
do not think that she is not in very great pain. She is in very great pain.

120
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:12,460
That is now the follow up 2 days later.

121
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:25,780
-She took the remedy on 14.00. Anthracinum 200 and she felt dizzy very soon

122
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:31,050
after she took the remedy and she was about to get a headache.

123
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:36,920
The infected area became very, very hot after the remedy.

124
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:44,620
And she felt...  contractions when she was walking around.

125
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,220
That persisted pretty much till today.

126
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:55,110
One hour after she took it, she went to sit in the park and she said she had

127
00:19:55,210 --> 00:20:01,200
more peaceful concentration than in days and she realized that something was right.

128
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:07,300
She said she didn't realize that she had lost that until the peace returned.

129
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:11,290
By two and a half hours after the remedy, she was exhausted but she had

130
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:14,170
more pain free movement of the neck.

131
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:26,450
Suddenly by 7 in the evening, 5 hours after the remedy the muscles that were very painful

132
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:30,970
involved with the ulcer were much better.

133
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:36,370
And she had an aggravating feeling of peace and sleepiness.

134
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:42,120
She said I'm a walking zombie where the previous night in the same time

135
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,950
she was worse with pain and restlessness.

136
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,540
She said I feel like I'll sleep forever.

137
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:54,620
The first night she looked forward to the nighttime because she had very bad nights.

138
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:01,860
And she was confident that she would have a restless sleep and she had very improved sleep.

139
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:13,970
Then the next day there was definite improvement in the sense of the pain being lessened

140
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:17,470
but you couldn't really see any difference.

141
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:33,230
Now yesterday it's spread out, it involved more area especially extending to the neck.

142
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:39,890
It was more painful again though not like before the remedy, it was worse than the

143
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:47,990
preceding day and she experienced throbbing pain but not that burning that she had.

144
00:21:50,230 --> 00:22:02,140
Today it was down in size, yesterday it was purple and she didn't want to touch it at all

145
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,230
and then today it was down in size, softer and more flat and after an hour

146
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:20,660
it began exuding small amounts of the same infected discharge.

147
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:27,560
It's harder and more painful while she is up and moving and definitely better

148
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:30,470
while she is sitting.

149
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:37,750
She had some headaches today but it is much less painful than yesterday still.

150
00:22:54,680 --> 00:23:02,980
This actually is the fourth day that he talks about the case and about every day progress.

151
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,110
He says actually some interesting things.

152
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:13,140
What is interesting to hear in this case is that she became sleepy.

153
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:21,000
Sleepiness after a remedy, desire to sleep and sleep for days perhaps is a good sign and

154
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:29,080
you have to understand that this shows that the remedy is acting deeply.

155
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:36,260
Another point that was good is the sense of peace that she felt.

156
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:51,440
She had a sense of peace inside her and also you see that the actual mass becomes bigger.

157
00:23:53,940 --> 00:24:00,350
Don't worry about that, as long as the other signs are present.

158
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:10,670
The actual size became bigger, that is no problem as long as there is a sense of peace,

159
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:22,590
there is sleepiness, there is a sense of well-being or mental-emotional amelioration,

160
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:26,100
a regression of the tumor.

161
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:36,840
As long the general state of the patient is getting better,

162
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:40,270
both of these actions are acceptable.

163
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:47,270
In this case it followed the first course.

164
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,760
-3 days after the remedy was given...

165
00:24:56,350 --> 00:25:01,610
-For how long it was there the cyst?
-For 8 years.

166
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:15,000
She is much better, every day better, there is ups and down but today she is doing

167
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:18,520
extremely well, yesterday it opened up.

168
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:23,750
Friday she felt... actually there was an evolution...

169
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:31,940
After the remedy the pain were dramatically and there were immediate effects that were felt.

170
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:45,420
But to be brief the actual thing became large, it became really large, it was 5-6 inc.

171
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:52,340
across and people would look at and they didn't believe.

172
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,930
But she was comfortable in comparison.

173
00:25:56,030 --> 00:26:05,530
-It's very strange that the size is bigger but the actual pain is reduced.

174
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:14,090
-Now what happened was that by Friday, 2 days ago, there were a lot of sensations,

175
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:21,840
not hot burning that was there but prickle sensations and a lot of pressure and you could see

176
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:25,920
at certain points where it was beginning to get right, in different areas

177
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:30,860
where little white areas were forming and you could see underneath.

178
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:38,340
Yesterday after she got out of the bath it was starting to discharge.

179
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:49,000
Maybe she lost a teaspoon of pus and today maybe a table spoon.

180
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:59,830
It's way down compared to what it was, there is no pain whatsoever or very mild

181
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:07,170
and the skin coloration started to come in around the edges.

182
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:15,090
She is a prover, she always has that with the remedies, she has proving symptoms

183
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:21,830
all of which are very strongly representing Anthracinum.

184
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:31,420
She had some dizziness all the week, headaches and in the afternoon very irresponsive

185
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:38,920
to work which is strong to Anthracinum actually and if anything she is a workaholic type.

186
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:45,180
Then she gets restless at night and at 3 in the morning she sleeps better.

187
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:49,010
Her appetite has been decreased, she lost a couple of pounds

188
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:55,520
but overall she is feeling very well.
-Great.

189
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:13,420
That must be the 7th day, already it has started discharging.

190
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:19,420
It discharged for another 10 days. It discharged quite a lot of matter.

191
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:25,500
In the beginning the matter was offensive, eventually there was no smell from discharge,

192
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:33,590
it was discharged without smell but the most important thing is that this lady

193
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:37,420
had a tremendous amelioration.

194
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:43,520
If you can find the follow up, there are some more follow ups I think in paper.

195
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:02,350
I hope you will find it because it is very impressive.

196
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:10,410
This is completely gone but this is not important.

197
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:19,860
What is important is that this woman had gone through grief 18 years ago.

198
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:28,510
15 or 18 years ago, long years ago she had gone through grief and because of that grief

199
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:34,170
and after that grief she was never able to have her feelings back.

200
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:39,930
Her feelings were cut off in a big manner.

201
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:50,400
She was not able to really enjoy life and not only that but she had

202
00:29:50,500 --> 00:30:01,810
not exactly an aversion to sex but she had really not enjoyed sex ever since that incident

203
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:05,250
where she had that big grief.

204
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:12,000
Nat. mur. was given, Pulsatilla was given and several other remedies were given without

205
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,170
ever touching the case.

206
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:22,980
After Anthracinum she felt everything was coming back and for several days

207
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:35,750
she was crying and crying and she would have pictures of the past coming back.

208
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:44,960
Pictures of the past would come up and her husband would call me and say,

209
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:54,850
she is crying all the time, she wants the window open and what shall I do?

210
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,850
I said console her.

211
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:15,640
He said that's very strange because yesterday, I was in the class and he was coming and

212
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:22,300
she was crying so much that he telephoned her and tried to talk to her.

213
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:27,550
After talking to her he said I was a little bit upset.

214
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:34,970
In the night I would go back to the house to see how she was because I felt

215
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:39,320
she was really bad crying all the time.

216
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,220
He had spoken in the middle of the noon, in the middle of the course

217
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,900
and then the course was finished and he went back home.

218
00:31:54,590 --> 00:32:00,970
He said I was amazed to hear that she said that after talking to me, consoling,

219
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:03,570
I was much better.

220
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:14,890
Now you will think that this is a case of Pulsatilla and you go and prescribe Pulsatilla.

221
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:17,320
No, this is wrong.

222
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:28,150
When you see all this upheaval happening inside the patient, wait and you will see miracles.

223
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:35,230
If you give Pulsatilla in order to stop her crying, you may spoil the case.

224
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:40,550
In this case I doubt if one dose of Pulsatilla would have really spoil the case

225
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:43,750
but you may spoil the case.

226
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:51,650
She went on crying for 7-8 days.

227
00:32:54,490 --> 00:33:01,230
She cried and cried and cried exactly the way that Pulsatilla does and Pulsatilla

228
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:09,240
was helping the case according to her husband but never touching the case in a deeper level.

229
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:20,890
What was interesting is that what I have been teaching all these years that sometimes

230
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:23,230
it does this work.

231
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:50,660
In my teachings several times I have said that you have a case with different layers.

232
00:33:55,570 --> 00:34:00,390
That's very interesting phenomena which I have seen many times.

233
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:14,380
Here we have Anthracinum, maybe Pulsatilla, Silica, Calcarea carbonica.

234
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:22,800
This is actually the real state of the patient, that means the patient will need

235
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:26,230
first Anthracinum, then Pulsatilla, then Silica, then Calcarea carbonica

236
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:32,190
in a course of 2-3 years before this person is really cured.

237
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:41,800
Now you never discover Anthracinum because it is a small remedy, a difficult remedy and

238
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:46,060
you prescribed different other remedies.

239
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:58,470
That is every time she has something severe or a cold or something in disposition or

240
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:07,480
a general symptomatology or acute symptomatology, a picture is here formed.

241
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:14,390
The one time is Pulsatilla, the other time is Lachesis, the third time is Gelsemium

242
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:20,700
and every time you give the remedy this goes away.

243
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:34,800
This layer upon the layers goes away with a particular remedy and you have the impression...

244
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,720
What she says it's absolutely here.

245
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:45,820
He feels that this woman had good homeopathic treatment because every time she was treated,

246
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,640
she was treated successfully.

247
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:52,900
I had this and I was treated, I had that and I was treated.

248
00:35:53,000 --> 00:36:04,990
But the actual peeling off layers had actually never started.

249
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:13,820
It is now with Anthracinum that he has the first deep remedy that takes away that first layer.

250
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:19,240
Everything else that happens upon that layer, it was taken care.

251
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:25,810
This woman could have upon that chronic state, could have lumbago.

252
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:30,220
Rush tox and lumbago away. She could have headache, Pulsatilla.

253
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,340
Pulsatilla takes headache away.

254
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,310
She has a common cold, Gelsemium. Gelsemium takes the cold away.

255
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:39,660
Everything happens from Anthracinum upwards.

256
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,990
But never from Anthracinum downwards.

257
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:54,810
Once you see this kind of deep reaction, don't be in a hurry to give a remedy.

258
00:36:54,910 --> 00:37:02,910
You would be surprised the way he describes the case how close she was to Pulsatilla.

259
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:08,800
Everybody would say she is crying so much, she is suffering so much, why don't you give

260
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,910
a Pulsatilla to relieve her? Wrong.

261
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:16,660
You should never give Pulsatilla in this case.

262
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:23,750
Console her, yes. You can give all these measures but don't give a remedy.

263
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:49,220
As it progresses the energy is strong, the mental clarity became very acute,

264
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,900
she never had that clarity before.

265
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:59,050
The emotions became alive, the sexual sphere was open.

266
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:04,410
She says I'm enjoying life as I've never enjoying before.

267
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:13,060
That is the action that you expect from the right, what we call, constitutional remedy.

268
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:18,740
Whatever you call it. Here it is a confusion of terms.

269
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:25,470
Let us say that this person really needs Anthracinum, Silica, Pulsatilla and Calcarea.

270
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:30,490
What can be said would be the constitutional remedy out of the four?

271
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:36,650
But we call it a constitutional remedy once it affects the whole organism

272
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:39,080
and takes away a layer.

273
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:46,080
The next time that we shall have a Pulsatilla situation and Pulsatilla will go deeper,

274
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:52,580
then we can also say that we are treating this person constitutionally.

275
00:38:53,500 --> 00:39:01,310
It happens sometimes that the person from the beginning of his life till the end of his life

276
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:06,060
will need one remedy, it will be a Calcarea carbonica case.

277
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,660
Every time he has a relapse, it goes to Calc. carbonica.

278
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:14,460
But these cases are very few.

279
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,000
Usually the cases are of that type.

280
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:25,970
Our generation is too ill, too sick to be treated with one remedy.

281
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:34,560
One remedy on a whole life of a person means that the person is really very healthy and

282
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:38,390
they are the cases where you treat and you are happy, you are satisfied,

283
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:42,720
your patient is satisfied, yourself is satisfied, you say you are god,

284
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:45,740
you make a miracle and things like that.

285
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:50,910
It doesn't happen every time, it doesn't happen every day.

286
00:39:55,420 --> 00:40:01,060
-I had the impression from what you were saying that had Anthracinum being given

287
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:06,890
before the sebaceous system became inflamed at the time when she became emotional and

288
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:13,570
she was given a Pulsatilla but you were referred that Anthracinum would have acted at that state.

289
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:25,310
-No I said that about 15 years ago when this woman had an emotional trauma,

290
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:30,650
after this trauma she went into an Anthracinum state.

291
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:35,470
So she was in an Anthracinum state for the last 15 years in her life.

292
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:43,410
And if Anthracinum was given by that time, the cyst would not have developed

293
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:48,390
and she would have been spare of all the suffering.

294
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:55,310
She said I was not living before, she could not even remember how life was.

295
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:58,910
When she came back into life it was another experience all together.
