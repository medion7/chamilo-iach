1
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,770
-Tell us what happened.

2
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:37,520
-When I left last time I didn't take the remedy yet and I really felt bad, I went to Skiathos

3
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,100
for 1 day and people in the shop...

4
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,100
-What was the remedy?

5
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:49,970
-Pulsatilla 12C every day and go up. I didn't get the remedy in time,

6
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:57,180
only when I took the boat Costas got it from Athens, so I didn't want to start taking

7
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,680
it and I stayed in Skiathos 1 day and I thought I'm collapsing.

8
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,930
I was crying all day, I was sweating, people in the shops told me to sit down

9
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,930
because they thought I would die.

10
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:21,780
Just water was coming out of my head. When I arrived it was a kind of weakness

11
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,430
and when I came home I took it.

12
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:36,180
It was in the 6th of October and within a day or two it stopped, all the sweating but

13
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:45,030
I started having within a few days very strong weakness which I couldn't even eat.

14
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:52,680
I was eating and all my energy was coming out of my mouth. I don't know how to explain it

15
00:01:52,780 --> 00:02:02,030
but I couldn't eat, I couldn't talk. I used to start talking and... vanish.

16
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:11,850
So I moved to 13 and it became worse. Then I thought maybe it's from the Pulsatilla

17
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:17,100
and I stopped it altogether and I felt OK. I came to myself,

18
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:24,400
I had more energy, I didn't have sweating, it was fine till about end of November.

19
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:31,870
I can't say that I was fabulous but comparing to what I was before, it was good.

20
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:43,870
Then in November I tasted something and within an hour or so I developed food poisoning

21
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,660
and I was in such a pain that I didn't know what to do anymore.

22
00:02:49,450 --> 00:03:00,100
I went to diarrhea and pain in the upper stomach like knives. I took the case

23
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:07,130
and I took Arsenicum 30 and immediately the pain stopped, it was cramps.

24
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:10,140
-Was food from the restaurant?

25
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:15,430
-No, my husband brought some chopped liver and he left it out and it's enough if it was

26
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:22,980
half an hour out in the minute I eat something which is not fresh, I can even smell in a restaurant

27
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:29,570
if it's not fresh and immediately I get it. It doesn't even take time, it goes into my mouth and

28
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:40,470
always like this. I don't if it has enough time to go down as I start feel it.

29
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:50,630
I had to take it about 3 times on Friday and on Saturday afternoon my husband

30
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:57,870
had to go to work from Saturday noon and usually he goes to the football, basketball,

31
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,220
he works on the Israeli television.

32
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:07,620
In the beginning a friend was in my and left and I really felt so alone

33
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:16,620
and I start calling and looking. It was a kind of suspicious mind with loneliness, it was terrible

34
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:23,390
and I made a scene because I told my children and friends and everybody was mixed in it

35
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,470
and it was a scene, it was something unbelievable.

36
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:34,130
-About this possibility of your husband going somewhere suspicious?

37
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:39,460
-No, he normally goes at 12 but they go to eat to a restaurant and the game starts

38
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,740
only at 9 o'clock in the evening. So I was cross because I didn't feel good and he knew

39
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:50,560
that I didn't feel good and he didn't even call to see how I am. That was what annoyed me.

40
00:04:51,840 --> 00:05:01,290
Probably I did proving on Arsenicum or whatever. Then when he came home at 12 o'clock I told him

41
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:04,790
it's good that you come and he says, what do you think I'm doing? I'm working,

42
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:10,670
I'm not cheating on you, he put the word cheating, well it comes from your mouth not mine.

43
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:15,160
-He prevented the worse.

44
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,910
-That was the story for a few days and since then he doesn't forget the scene that I gave him.

45
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:22,310
I didn't make any scene, I was quite but he...

46
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:27,540
-But still it was out of your habit or you have done such things?

47
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:35,830
-No, I never care, I don't. He goes to work all the time like this but because I didn't feel good,

48
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:44,540
I'm a jealous person if there is a reason, it can be also imaginary but something has to be there,

49
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:53,790
I'm not completely blind but I think it was the Arsenicum working because I felt alone

50
00:05:53,890 --> 00:06:01,550
and I felt neglected and sick and why he didn't call? I was sick and he didn't mind,

51
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,640
he didn't care, he didn't have work anyway until 9.

52
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,470
-Did you have some friends coming to you?

53
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:15,720
-I had Mary, she came to me and stayed until 2 o'clock that it happened. Then she went away.

54
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,810
-In the morning?

55
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,990
-After he has gone, she came for about 2 hours and then she left and then I started

56
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:31,630
developing loneliness and pity and how come that he didn't call when I don't feel good.

57
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:36,390
Because normally he goes every time and I don't care. I thought maybe it's the

58
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:45,840
Arsenicum proving because I took 3 doses which are a lot for me, one after the other.

59
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:54,480
But it helped the stomach, it was beautiful. Then in January I developed flu.

60
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:04,170
It started with throat pain and I lost my voice and then it went down to bronchitis

61
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:11,860
and then I felt that it went into my lungs and I felt it was a kind of Pulsatilla symptoms.

62
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:19,030
I was better outside in the fresh air but actually Pulsatilla when she has a flu

63
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:24,860
she is not better outside. It doesn't matter, I took it and it did pass within 2 hours

64
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,220
like I never had anything.

65
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:37,950
Then at the beginning of February, middle of January already, I felt very down mentally,

66
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:46,300
depressed and no energy, I didn't want to go to work. Every little thing irritated me,

67
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:53,700
I shouted at work I was on the edge, every little thing, I was crying, it was terrible.

68
00:07:54,580 --> 00:08:00,780
Then they had a Reiki course at the beginning of February, so I decided that I'll go and do it,

69
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,830
maybe I can help myself, put myself back to energy.

70
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:11,700
There was a woman there coming to help and she had a very strong flu and coughing on everybody

71
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:17,950
and I remember telling myself be aware because you are going to catch the flu

72
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:25,700
and I never catch any flu. I never catch from people and I had a feeling that I'm going to get it

73
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,300
and within a few days I had it.

74
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:37,800
It started a very strong flu and I was in a seminar then and it was giving oscillo

75
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:44,720
and I had pain in my whole body and he said take that it's good, it's the same and I took one.

76
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:51,120
I think that was my mistake because then for a month and a half I was so sick.

77
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:57,900
I've been so sick in my whole life. Because afterwards Pulsatilla didn't work anymore.

78
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,860
I tried it and it didn't help, it was too late. I remember what you said, it's good to have acutes.

79
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:11,120
At the beginning I was very happy but it developed so bad that after 1 month

80
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:18,210
I had to stay in bed, I was so weak I couldn't go to work and for me it's the end of the world.

81
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:21,370
I never stay in bed, I prefer to go to work.

82
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,950
-Did you have fever?

83
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:37,230
-I never have fever, if I had I had 37, very low fever. It was as the same as when I had Mercury.

84
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:44,730
When I received Mercury a few years ago I developed this kind of flu, this kind of sensations,

85
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:54,200
burn throat, you can't swallow and I don't have tonsils. And I thought if it's the picture that

86
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,950
I develop proving on Mercury maybe I should take Mercury but I remembered what it did to me

87
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:02,380
and I said, I'm not touching nothing, I had enough.

88
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:14,030
After about a month the lungs started, I was coughing, I felt it's a pneumonia and

89
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:21,780
everybody in Israel was in the hospital and dying from pneumonia this time and I went to the doctor

90
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:27,280
and she wanted me out quickly before she would catch it. She said you should take antibiotics,

91
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:34,280
you have pneumonia and she gave me Zinnat. I took the pills, it take me another day

92
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:40,700
to take it from the pharmacy and another 2 days to hold at home to see maybe I don't have to take it

93
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:48,530
and then on Saturday afternoon I took 1 because it was really impossible and I lied down.

94
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:54,360
Normally I don't sleep in the afternoon, I can't sleep I feel bad when I wake up

95
00:10:54,460 --> 00:11:00,700
and I lied on my left ear and within 10 minutes I woke up with a terrible pain

96
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,880
in the left ear and stooped the face, half of the face was paralyzed.

97
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,610
-After you took this antibiotic?
-About 1 hour after.

98
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,860
-What was the antibiotic?

99
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:22,210
-Zinat. It's called Zinnat, you take 1 in the morning, 1 the evening, a strong one.

100
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:31,960
I heard that afterwards it gives all kind of side effects and I put some ear drops.

101
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,710
-Did you take a second dose?

102
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:40,620
-Then they told me now you have a problem in your ear, you should take more.

103
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,610
Otherwise you will be with this and with that and you shouldn't stop.

104
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:52,860
So I took a few more doses, I didn't take the whole of it and it was getting worse and worse.

105
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:58,710
The whole situation was worse and worse, so I stopped the antibiotics.

106
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:11,800
First of all before the antibiotics I lost my smell, then after the antibiotics I couldn't see

107
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:23,700
and I couldn't hear and it was like in a bubble. I couldn't see the people from 1 m,

108
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:29,950
I couldn't see television, I couldn't see in a movie. Normally I sit on the 17th row,

109
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:37,400
I sat in the 5th row and I took my daughter's glasses and to read I could, which before I needed

110
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:47,860
glasses before of the age. It was funny, everything changed and people told me it's the flu,

111
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:58,700
that's the symptoms of the flu, many people have it but I don't know. Then my mouth started getting

112
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:06,800
so dry at night and in the day time I used to pour myself 20 cups of tea.

113
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:15,200
I used to put them in a line. I usually don't drink more than 1 or 2 cups the day and

114
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:25,700
that if you remind me or I force myself and then I was putting the big cups in a row and

115
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:35,330
pouring like this and drinking them like this. At night my mouth was so dry that I couldn't move it

116
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:42,800
and I had to wet my mouth, I didn't want to drink and I used to go every 15 min to the toilet.

117
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,030
It was unbelievable and then I thought something is wrong and I was so weak

118
00:13:52,130 --> 00:14:02,280
and I couldn't see nothing. I don't how I lived. When I looked backwards I don't know how I coped,

119
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:07,780
I was in seminars, I was working and I was shouting at everybody.

120
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,380
My daughter told me not to come to work anymore because I'm offending the people.

121
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:25,780
You better stay at home because you make us nervous and I had enough, so I put my computer

122
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:32,630
and I said that's it, I'm going to find the solution for that. I put all the symptoms

123
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:43,980
I'll tell you which ones, I put dryness mouth at night, frequent urination, stopped ears, lying

124
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:53,020
ameliorates. When I lied down it was funny. At night if I lied down on the right side in the

125
00:14:53,120 --> 00:15:00,520
morning I woke up and the left ear was fine and then when I just sit like this or make this

126
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,320
movement it used to get stopped again.

127
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,470
-What remedy did you take?

128
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:19,050
-At the beginning I took Sepia because of the pain in the throat and I took Sepia

129
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:24,850
and the next morning I woke up with no pain in the throat at all, clean and it was really a very

130
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:30,600
strong pain. Very happy I went out, I didn't go to work, I left 60 people there,

131
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:39,600
beautiful time but other things didn't stop so next day I took Phosphorus again

132
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:46,600
because there are more, depending over, throat, pain left, post nasal drip, it was the most

133
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:51,130
horrible thing and then it was even worse the Phosphorus.

134
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:55,450
It became terrible and then it started like normal.

135
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:59,520
Acid coming out and burning my throat.

136
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:03,520
-You still had this intense thirst?

137
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:14,950
-Yes. I still had, that's why I took it. I thought it might help and then I started vomiting acid,

138
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:24,210
acid came out and I said that's it, I'm going back to Nux vomica. It helps always.

139
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:40,630
So I took 2 or 3 globules of 30 Nux vomica in water and I had a spoon and then within 1 hour

140
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:48,630
the burning went away. Then I took another time, in the evening-night and within 1 hour

141
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:53,990
I felt a different person and the next morning it was fabulous.

142
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:06,310
I just could forget but the ear was still another 2 days like this. My well-being was different.

143
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:17,380
I felt good, I was not nervous and the urination dropped every 1 hour and then 3 times the night

144
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:25,160
and the mouth was less dry and after 1 week I had the guts to go and check my blood.

145
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:34,710
At the beginning I knew it's high, I thought it was 170, 200 maybe that means high for me

146
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:41,200
and then I went to my neighbor because she has the thing that checks and I said do me a favor

147
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,780
can you check my blood?

148
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,200
She said come tomorrow 6.45 in the morning before I go to work and I'll do it.

149
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:54,450
So it was about 1 week after I took Nux vomica and I really felt good already and she took it

150
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:59,750
and I looked at it and she looked at it and I was in a shock. It was 462.

151
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,210
-What? Sugar?

152
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:10,130
-Glucose in my blood, that was when I felt good and I didn't run so much and I didn't drink so much.

153
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:18,320
So I looked at her, I thought the end of the world is coming.

154
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:24,640
I said it's not enough the blood pressure, I have diabetes also. It was a real shock.

155
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:34,450
In the same day my friend died from cancer and the whole time that I was sick she was

156
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:42,160
also suffering and because I was sick I was not in touch so much and whenever I called

157
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:46,920
they said she is sleeping, I didn't think that she is in morphine because before we talked

158
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:53,010
and everything was fine. And only the last few days I found out that she is really dying.

159
00:18:53,510 --> 00:19:00,260
I didn't believe in it but at the day that I went to the clinic, I went also to the funeral.

160
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:15,910
Since then I decided that I'm not going to take any insulin or any pills at all and if diet will help,

161
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:22,510
I had in my mind that as it comes it will go. I'll be on a diet.

162
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:26,250
-Before you had high sugar?

163
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:35,330
-I had 2 years ago 116 the most, a year ago after the Sulphur it went up to 140 but then the doctor

164
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:44,760
told me that I have to do a diet, the triglyceride went up and the sugar and the heart is OK.

165
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,110
-Did you check your heart when you went back?

166
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:58,000
-Yes she said everything is fine and I checked the eyes and everything is fine.

167
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:08,100
There was nothing in the back of the eye, no organ is getting real damage, it's like the function

168
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:20,080
is damaged, that's my feeling. When I had the ulcerative colitis I was in one of the worse states

169
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:26,430
that people ever being, I used to fill about 60 times a day buckets of blood.

170
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:33,180
And I came out of it and I don't look like one with ulcerative colitis.

171
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:39,160
So I don't know maybe my organism is going back.

172
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:49,310
-Wait a moment. When you saw this woman, this woman she has this instrument

173
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:50,560
and she measures it.

174
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:54,390
-We checked it again and again.
-You didn't go to a laboratory?

175
00:20:54,490 --> 00:21:00,650
-Of course I did, 2 days later because I had to wait in a line.

176
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:07,240
-So what was the measurement.
-318 after 2 days of strong diet.

177
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:14,390
-And then you checked it again?

178
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:23,140
-Then I checked it again, I can give you the whole measurements. 15th of March it was 462,

179
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:29,890
that was 6.45 in the morning. At 4 o'clock in the afternoon it was 275 already

180
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:43,310
because I didn't dare eating anything. 16th at 9 o'clock it was 303, 17th it was 318,

181
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:53,310
19th it was 275, 21st in the evening at 7 o'clock was 384 and then I started Nux vomica

182
00:21:53,410 --> 00:22:02,060
because I ordered LM, I was afraid to take anything but LM. I took LM2 once every

183
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:12,900
second day in the evening and the sugar started going down and it starts 256, 267.

184
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:25,140
It really went down, on 24th of March it was 283, 30 it was 256 and then after eating an hour

185
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:31,990
and a half was 272, which was good, and on the 31st of March was already 185.

186
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,390
But that was very strong diet, hardly any protein.

187
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,430
-Now how it is?

188
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:49,640
-Yesterday it was 159, now I checked it was 187 but I had lunch.

189
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,640
-You checked it after lunch?

190
00:22:52,740 --> 00:23:02,100
-No. We took the blood pressure and we also took the blood, so I can tell you

191
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:13,650
but in the morning it was 187. It's exactly like now after lunch and yesterday it was 168.

192
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,900
-Your blood pressure?

193
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:22,900
-150 over 95 yesterday night and this morning but when I had a very high blood sugar

194
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:31,510
the blood pressure was 110 over 70. It's ridiculous.

195
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:39,660
When the sugar was high, the blood pressure was down, now they are getting even.

196
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:54,410
After few days, after about 2 weeks taking every second day, I developed a very strong eruption

197
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:05,810
and all kind of pimples and then eczema on my face. That was terrible. It was

198
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:14,290
dry and itching, I couldn't put nothing, so I stopped the LM too and within 2 days it went on,

199
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:25,970
off and then I had an abscess here which started like a little pimple and grew up to this size.

200
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:32,620
Then there was nothing I could do, I had to cut it off or find a solution.

201
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,980
So I called a pharmacy and asked to make me some mixture of cream to take it out.

202
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:46,160
-Who put it out, yourself? You cut it?

203
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:57,440
-No, I didn't. I just put cream on it and it came out, a mixture of Myristica and Hepar sulphur.

204
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:02,520
I didn't know what to do or take a remedy or just put a cream because it went like this,

205
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:10,360
the ear was standing like this, my face was red. It was a year ago exactly that

206
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:21,460
I had it and a surgeon cut it. He didn't do a good job probably and it came back after the Nux.

207
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:41,110
She mixed in 3X Echinacea, Belladonna, Silica, Hepar sulph and Myristica in a cream

208
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:44,460
and it works fabulous. In the morning it was out.

209
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:54,210
-Opened and discharged?
-Opened, discharged, it came out a lot.

210
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,610
-How are you feeling now?

211
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:22,290
-I feel now still very irritable, I cry very easily, everything bothers me, every little thing.

212
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:34,290
It was before and it still does. Physically I feel much better but mentally I get very angry

213
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,370
and it comes like this into my ears.

214
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,470
-The anger?

215
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:55,710
-Yes the anger comes from the diaphragm into my ears and my head.

216
00:26:56,630 --> 00:27:00,370
-You become red?
-I don't know, I don't go to the mirror.

217
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:08,810
-Somebody must have told you, if he had seen you are very red. And then you explode?

218
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:14,060
-I explode yes.
-You don't retain, you don't hold it.

219
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:21,870
-I explode. I had last week a Shankaran seminar and I exploded there on him.

220
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:28,520
Quickly I stopped the LM because I started the LM again, not on him, I told everybody

221
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:34,710
what I think of them. That's my nature, I usually tell.

222
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:43,790
-But this aggression that you feel, this anger is something that you know about or it is new?

223
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:46,640
-No, it's not new, the last year.

224
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:52,570
-It's the last year which the anger has come?

225
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:57,900
-I always say what I have to say, I explode sometimes people look at me.

226
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:05,890
-To say something is different than to say it with anger. What I'm asking is the anger...

227
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:12,360
-I always did. Now it's with anger. Before it used to be with anger and

228
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:19,610
sometimes I think it's also anger because I say what I have to say. If something I don't like,

229
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,710
I say it, I don't care.

230
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:29,210
-So this is not something new.
-It's not new but now it's more intense.

231
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:35,140
-But why you complain? I asked you what is your complain and you say...

232
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:41,110
-Because it bothers me, it's intense.
-It's too much.

233
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:43,110
-Of course it's too much.

234
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:47,270
-Before there was a time where you had this anger?

235
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:51,970
-Of course.
-No, this intensity of the anger.

236
00:28:52,070 --> 00:29:04,220
-Usually before menses it was very intense and I knew I'm going to have my period.

237
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:07,020
That's my nature.

238
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,770
-But now you have it whether you have menses or not.

239
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:15,020
-No, I stopped my menses a few months ago but I still have the signs

240
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,920
and after the Nux vomica I got my menses again.

241
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:30,040
-What I say is that you don't have anger before menses. You have anger every day.

242
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:34,790
How is your sleep?
-Good. I go to sleep very late.

243
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:39,370
-Why? You have a lot of energy and you want to stay up?

244
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:47,620
-I have energy and even, it's many years already, I read a book for instance and

245
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:54,950
then I feel that I'm falling asleep and then I wake myself up and I continue reading.

246
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:58,810
I go and have - well not now- but I used to go and have chocolate.

247
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:04,810
I used to go and have some kind of stimulant to wake myself. I don't why, it's stupid,

248
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:10,560
I don't know why, I should sleep because I love sleeping, I love being in my bed.

249
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:16,560
-How many pills of antibiotics you took? Twice the day for how many days, 5-6 days?

250
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:28,910
-Something like that. I stopped before the end.
-And was no trouble with your intestines?

251
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:38,250
-I always have trouble with my intestines but after the Nux suddenly I stopped having diarrhea.

252
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:44,950
Normally I wake up, I go to the toilet, sometimes up to 5 times in the morning

253
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:54,420
but when I took the Nux I hardly went once. I felt quite good.

254
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:10,420
When I started taking the Nux vomica it was much better and I feel good with it, I'm less tense.

255
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:14,500
-You let the anger out.

256
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,500
-I always let the anger out.
-No.

257
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:28,250
-Not enough because you have kept a lot of anger inside and in spite of the fact you let

258
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:34,430
some anger, not all, now you are letting it out, that's why you feel better.

259
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:44,670
-Sometimes I say things that people look at me like this, I say well I'm Bovista.

260
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:50,370
I say everything, I don't care I just say everything that comes out of my mouth,

261
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:53,250
so we always laugh with friends.

262
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:58,190
-Do you feel the heat still or you feel more cool?

263
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:06,490
-Here in Alonissos I started to sweat again, maybe because I was carrying the whole day suitcases

264
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:13,460
and another thing which is strong is the pain and heaviness of my legs.

265
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:20,930
I always had problems ascending, always. Even when I was a runner.

266
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:26,910
-Did you bring any cardiogram with you?

267
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:30,410
-I brought it last time, you have it, I didn't do since then.

268
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,440
-No, this time.

269
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:40,040
-They didn't want to do it. They said you are OK. That's what she said the doctor.

270
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:43,140
I did all the checks, you are OK, go away from here.

271
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:51,590
-She did not want to make a cardiogram?
-Because she checked me in August.

272
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:55,310
-Wait a moment. This is a private doctor or this is the insurance.

273
00:32:55,410 --> 00:33:00,890
-It's the insurance, the government.
-So you don't do whatever you like.

274
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:06,440
-No, I have to wait a few days, I have to know 10 days before that I'm going to be sick

275
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,710
in order to make an appointment.

276
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:14,190
-You have a very good government. You better change it.

277
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:19,560
-Today we are changing it.
-Have Mr (?)

278
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:27,770
-Let's hope we are changing but still the anticipation is very strong.

279
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:31,300
I always have to be in time.

280
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,940
-Which is the highest that you have taken from Nux vomica?

281
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,190
-LM 3 twice the day now.

282
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:52,000
-The highest?
-30 in acute. It always worked.

283
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:52,750
-Not higher?

284
00:33:52,850 --> 00:34:01,840
-Never higher. You did like this when I told you last time that I took Nux vomica, no good.

285
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,270
-It depends what you told me. If it was good, I would say it's good.

286
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:14,370
-It was the same thing, the burning and I found out that Nux vomica works. It's funny.

287
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:23,520
So far it did work but maybe the potency is not the right one. I just want to ask you

288
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:31,520
something else. I have something which is very prominent with my eyes like

289
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:40,550
if I'm in a movie or watching television. But if I'm going to a show like theater

290
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:46,120
and it doesn't matter which one, it can be a happy one, a music.

291
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:59,780
If I sit in the audience and there is a show and all the lights going to the stage my eyes

292
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:07,020
immediately become heavy and I fall asleep and I start snoring which is very embarrassing

293
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:18,870
to my husband. It's like this since I remember myself, in flamenco, in cats, in starlight express,

294
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:23,120
it doesn't matter my eyes become heavy and I'm somewhere else.

295
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:32,700
In a minute and I'm gone. I hear it, I know, I'm here, I'm not sleeping.

296
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:45,110
It seems that the strong lights... even here. I felt it today also

297
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:52,960
and from the light outside of the windows, it's not that I'm tired.

298
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:13,950
And this problem with my feet in ascending, it's really painful also.

299
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:18,950
-The thighs.
-Yes. I can't even walk.

300
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:24,500
-You feel weak?
-Pain and heavy.

301
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,450
-On going upstairs.

302
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:36,750
-Also if I'm going on the hill, if it's a little bit. Normally I can walk a lot.

303
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:47,610
-OK before we do anything, I would like to have a cardiogram made, we'll ask again our friend

304
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:56,630
to make a cardiogram for you. So we have this record on record and to be sure.

305
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,630
Then we shall decide.

306
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:11,030
-Another thing, the liver enzymes were very high and after the Nux went to normal

307
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:12,460
because I did check.

308
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:23,700
-Can you give me the numbers?
-It was in the 15th of March GGT was 35, the...

309
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,950
-That's normal.
-No, that's not normal in our scale.

310
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:29,450
-What is the normal in that scale?

311
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:34,680
-I have the whole list and I'll give it to you to see what is normal and not normal.

312
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:41,260
It went down from 25 to 23 and from 31 to 20 which is the normal.

313
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,910
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

314
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:48,660
-You have a different scale in Israel?

315
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:59,660
-I don't know. She said there is hemoglobin, it's also the check-up that they do 3 months

316
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:08,010
backwards, after sugar, it was also 10,9 when the scale is 4,5 up to 6.

317
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:18,660
That means that I had much more than 500 the last 3 months, so I don't know if I have to do it again.

318
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:24,240
They checked albumin, my albumin was OK.

319
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:33,410
-Did they find albumin and urine?
-No, that was OK.

320
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,910
-What else was found?

321
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:44,340
-Everything is fine except the glucose now. It was not fine 1 month and a half ago, a lot of things

322
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:50,380
-Did you have your glucose check back? Let us say 5 years back?

323
00:38:50,600 --> 00:39:06,000
-Yes, it always was 100, 110. I had a little bit of diabetes when I was pregnant, 120,130

324
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:17,920
not much but it considered as diabetes in pregnancy and my daughter was born 3750 in

325
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:20,770
8 months which shows it a lot.

326
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:34,420
-You have a very strange organism, reacting very aggressive with any stimulation but

327
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:44,770
as we have said the fact that you had some acutes is a good thing.

328
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:47,420
-As long it doesn't kill you.

329
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:56,620
-Of course and it seems that Nux vomica was correct, when you took Nux vomica.

330
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:01,720
For Sepia the way you said it, I would have thought of Bryonia.

331
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:04,360
-Yes, Bryonia came out also.

332
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:17,530
-Sepia and Nux vomica work complementary. Sepia and Nux vomica most probably did the work.

333
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:27,630
Now the fact that you are still very aggressive we'll discuss it in the class but

334
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,600
after I see your cardiogram.

335
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:38,170
-Things bother me like what is going in Israel. I'm so happy that

336
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:42,800
I'm here because I was sure if I would be there, I would get a heart attack. I'm so angry.

337
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,700
-With the government?

338
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:55,420
-The cheating that is going on, about the non-fair, I don't understand how people do things like this.

339
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,920
That bothers me, if somebody does something wrong, it makes me crazy.

340
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:10,850
I can fight to death if something like this happens and it annoys me, if things are not correct

341
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:18,750
but I shouldn't, I should leave it, it's not my problem. I should learn.

342
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:20,600
-The politicians.

343
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:27,750
-It's not only the politicians, it's also with your friends, if people that you know don't behave

344
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:41,330
correct and if people are rude especially. If somebody is rude, or I shout or I just blow up

345
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:47,690
and tell them in the face and sometimes it's not so nice but I do it.

346
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:31,640
This is a typical case of what happens in the practice. We give remedies, sometimes they are

347
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:39,250
right, wrong, right, wrong, maybe they come up right. So she came up right most probably.

348
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:48,660
The problem of course is here, what I have said many times so far.

349
00:42:49,410 --> 00:43:00,030
When you have an acute and the acute is strong, that is the critical time whether you

350
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:11,430
better find the correct remedy. It will be much better picture if she had been treated

351
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:25,060
during the time of pneumonia but what can you do? She never contacted me of course

352
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:36,730
but she could have found by chance even the right remedy and then you could have seen

353
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:48,020
a much better situation and you would not have these imbalances which her organism presents.

354
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:56,120
Her organism seems to be very sensitive to any kind of stimulation.

355
00:43:56,820 --> 00:44:05,770
It's very unusual to see such reactions as she describes, maybe she exaggerates of course,

356
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:13,040
when this is there, she makes it there, it's a little bit of exaggeration but still OK.

357
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:22,200
You get an idea, you say is that true now, it came up to here?

358
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:37,700
But the reactions that she gets this organism is really peculiar and very strong

359
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:48,460
and with her imagination she blows them up as well, so she doubles them in size and in severity

360
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:58,390
and you get tremblings. But when she says sugar 4... this is not her imagination.

361
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:06,360
Most probably that's why I asked what about having a laboratory examination and if the

362
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:16,140
laboratory says the next day, after 2 days it's 380 that means the sugar shoot up very suddenly

363
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:29,600
and not in a constant state. Something happened and your sugar levels shoot up.

364
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:40,940
I don't know what it was. What is important for her is of course to have a better diet.

365
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:47,120
You remember last time we strongly advised her to have a better diet.

366
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:51,850
-I lost 12 kilos.

367
00:45:51,950 --> 00:46:02,980
-That's good but unless you were frightened by the sugar level you most have probably

368
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,240
lost only 2 instead of 12.

369
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:15,080
-No, I promised Hannah.
-This is my experience.

370
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:38,000
But what is interesting, as you see also, is the anger which is coming out.

371
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:54,400
By taking the case, by getting all the information, you know quite a lot about the person how she reacts.

372
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:58,690
She has kept anger inside, there is no question about it.

373
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:06,970
This anger does not come out of the blue. If she has kept sadness, sadness would come up.

374
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:14,270
If she had kept anger, anger came up and anger has to be expressed.

375
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:23,040
This is a problem for her husband and children most probably and her friends.

376
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:34,210
But still as a homeopath you have to say, when you feel this, don't hold it back.

377
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:43,660
She says, I have expressed anger all my life but not enough.

378
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:54,020
You see, each one of us has kept a certain portion and if what is kept inside

379
00:47:54,120 --> 00:48:00,370
then we see this physical symptomatology arising.

380
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:11,360
Then of course treatment by chemical drugs can put you on a vicious circle and then

381
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:12,960
going down, down, down.

382
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:23,710
At this moment what is the remedy for her?

383
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:46,350
Graphites? You put some symptoms. I was thinking of Chamomilla and I said, show me

384
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:50,950
and Chamomilla was coming up by certain things you put.

385
00:48:52,450 --> 00:49:01,100
It's very interesting the way that she describes it can be a kind of Chamomilla

386
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:13,190
where she cannot really retain the anger at all. You put too much anger.

387
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:36,990
But if she says that I feel good with Nux vomica at this stage and not only that but she says

388
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:41,080
I had an eruption with Nux vomica...

389
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:53,030
-I started the Nux vomica again because I had the tooth fixed and the sugar went up,

390
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:59,980
so I started the LM again and then after 2 weeks I had this anger

391
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:07,830
and an attack of ulcerative colitis with blood which I didn't have for years.

392
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:12,980
-But when I asked you with the antibiotics did you have anything?

393
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,480
-No, just a week ago.

394
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:19,980
-Later, it doesn't matter.
-Then I changed to LM.

395
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:26,580
-That means 1 month later but...
-I think it was from the Nux vomica.

396
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,230
-Forget it.
-No.

397
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:35,060
-No.
-What, from the antibiotics?

398
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:40,410
-Yes sure.
-But it was for half an hour and it was gone.

399
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:50,060
-It doesn't matter. The disturbance was not so much but why did I ask you did you have

400
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:59,020
a repercussion on your stomach? You are a person who has been suffering with ulcerative colitis

401
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:10,000
and you took antibiotics, so it starts spoiling the flora.

402
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:20,230
-No, I took acidophilus. I take all the time acidophilus, I'm pouring in acidophilus.

403
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:29,980
-What I know is that antibiotics will irritate the guts and most probably you will have symptoms

404
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:38,810
of colitis and Nux vomica took it away. Therefore Nux vomica is good for you

405
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:46,310
and I would suggest that you continue with LM every second day and if there is an

406
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:52,820
eruption coming, you have to continue. The eruption has to come out.

407
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:55,250
You can not say oh my god.

408
00:51:56,260 --> 00:52:00,140
-I continue the LM even if there an eruption.

409
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:07,800
-You continue and then the eruption may become even worse, as much as the organism needs

410
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:10,660
in order to get out of the situation.

411
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:16,650
-Because it says that with LM if there is something like this, you stop it, so I stopped it.

412
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:32,150
-Since LM has reacted so well as to bring out the eruption, keep the LM, don't change to 200, no.

413
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:46,320
-Couldn't it be that this colitis is an old symptom coming up again under Nux vomica?

414
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:49,400
-No, I don't think.

415
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:14,900
-From last time we saw some changes in the ECG and the posterior wall of the heart and on the side.

416
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:32,590
These changes represent the ECG in the following leads that is in II and III.

417
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:39,650
Then we saw an inversion of the T-wave, so that this wave is negative instead of positive

418
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:49,360
a slight impression of the T-segment. Now we don't see this at all, we see a normal examination,

419
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:56,810
the posterior wall will have the following lines. This is a bit disturbed by her trembling

420
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:01,200
but nevertheless we can't find any negative changes.

421
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:11,100
What is very impressive I registered it with higher speed and you can see one part of

422
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,780
the ECG especially clear.

423
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:21,480
We can find absolutely normal examination. That's all.

424
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:50,780
-So the Israeli cardiologist was correct not to give you a ECG. Now you consider yourself normal.

425
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:11,590
-After I took the Pulsatilla a year ago, it started a rheumatic pain in my joints,

426
00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:16,200
especially in the left hand, coming and going.

427
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:26,180
Sometimes it was really hard to work with it and also in the bones that lead to the fingers

428
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:37,930
and also in the left foot. After the Pulsatilla the cramps in the calves stopped

429
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:40,940
even though I was stretching.

430
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:51,180
I used to have it in stretching and it came back with the Nux vomica these cramps again and

431
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:59,260
after the Pulsatilla all this feeling with the numbness on the feet came back which went away

432
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:06,650
with the Phosphorus in the morning.

433
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:27,440
When I wrote this was when I was here during the seminar. I had little pimples in my mouth

434
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:38,950
and I was still feeling bad if I slept in the afternoon, I checked that.

435
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:46,030
This is a symptom since I remember myself, I feel like a headache and vomiting, nausea.

436
00:56:46,530 --> 00:57:02,180
If I go, which I never do but if something happens and I do go to sleep, I wake up very nauseated and

437
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:15,060
with a headache. The last time I had that was last week, even if I sleep 5 minutes I wake up like this.

438
00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:28,430
I don't sleep anymore only on the right side, I used to sleep only on the right, I don't.

439
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:39,280
-The last time you took Nux vomica LM for how long?

440
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:47,430
-I'm coming into it because usually I don't pay attention to what is going on with me.

441
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:55,180
I just wrote a few things and I'll come to it later. The only thing which I saw after the Pulsatilla

442
00:57:55,280 --> 00:58:03,610
with the Nux vomica was that I didn't sleep anymore the same way. I sleep like this with the

443
00:58:03,710 --> 00:58:14,200
hands up and the legs are like this, one is up but that's how I slept always.

444
00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:27,340
I found myself too busy, too much involved with everything that is going on and very upset

445
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:36,930
of what is going on in Israel, people cheating on the back of other people.

446
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:49,180
More like a Causticum, everything bothers me and I used to go very mad.

447
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:57,060
It annoys me in a minute and it's like it goes straight in my head and blowing it, it was terrible.

448
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:06,010
The only thing that I had amelioration was shaken a little bit, which then I remembered that

449
00:59:06,110 --> 00:59:12,290
I used to do it as a kid when I had asthma, the only thing that ameliorated was sitting like this

450
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:15,820
and doing like this all the time, slight movement.

451
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:36,990
I start everything from May. Memory, since May and before and now one of the worse things

452
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:38,390
is the memory.

453
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,500
-What happened?

454
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:48,960
-I lose words, I want to tell you something and the word doesn't come. I have to look through a draw,

455
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:58,620
you know, to think, think, think till the word comes and I don't remember the names of people

456
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:07,120
that I know very well. I want to do something and then if I don't do it or immediately

457
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:10,800
don't write it down within 1 minute I forget what I had to do.

458
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:21,720
Another funny thing is when I see a cut, like my husband cut his finger, I get like a...

459
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,470
it goes through here to my buttocks.

460
01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:31,870
-It's almost fainting.

461
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:42,470
-It's not fainting, it's like ticklish that moves from my feet up to my buttocks which it's funny.

462
01:00:43,470 --> 01:00:48,980
I could see people in the hospital dying and nothing moved me this way.

463
01:00:50,470 --> 01:00:53,400
-Is this something which is lately?

464
01:00:53,500 --> 01:01:02,720
-No, it's not lately, it's the last 10-20 years but it's quite strong now.

465
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:18,620
From the 14th of May while we were here, my left eye was all the time I had tears all the time

466
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:32,620
and it was red like an eruption. On the 20th of May all these little blisters on my tongue came,

467
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:42,120
especially at the end of the tongue, big one burning and then I had a kind of herpes inside my nose,

468
01:01:45,470 --> 01:01:49,670
but it's an old symptom. It's something that came back.

469
01:01:52,470 --> 01:02:05,450
Then I had like flu. Now I know what it is. The last 6 months when I get my period, if I do get it at all,

470
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:14,530
I have feeling like a flu, my back aches, my head aches, really like a flu and then 2 days later

471
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:28,640
I get my period. It happened already in the last 4 periods. I was not thirsty at all.

472
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:40,470
The levels of the sugar were quite high. If I look at it on the 22 of May it was 199 and

473
01:02:40,570 --> 01:02:44,660
after eating 248, that was high.

474
01:02:46,410 --> 01:02:50,300
-How did you examine? When you examine the blood?

475
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:56,310
-14 hours with no eating.
-How much it was then?

476
01:02:56,410 --> 01:03:06,470
-Then it was 199, that's why you told me to take one dose of 30 and then one dose of 200 and

477
01:03:06,570 --> 01:03:13,240
I tried to do that and it didn't help. So I went back to the LM and I continued with LM.

478
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:20,890
-You had only once sugar level check?
-All the time. I used to check it every day.

479
01:03:20,990 --> 01:03:24,890
-Yourself.
-Yes, I have the machine.

480
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:27,390
-And what are the readings?

481
01:03:27,490 --> 01:03:36,240
-The readings then in May were very high, 171 up to 248 two hours after eating.

482
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:44,140
What I'm telling you, I'm telling you the low one, the low one is without eating,

483
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:47,490
it's from the evening, about 14 hours without eating.

484
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,940
-Yes but how many times?

485
01:03:52,690 --> 01:04:21,110
-It was the average. The lowest one was 171. It was quite high, then I went back to the LM

486
01:04:21,210 --> 01:04:30,060
and it went down a little bit but still it was 154, it didn't go much down anymore

487
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:33,740
and I went up to LM 7.

488
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:50,240
Then I had very strong gas and the stomach was very bloated and in the afternoon I got my period.

489
01:04:50,670 --> 01:05:00,580
It was when I was here. Then at 9 o'clock I took Nux vomica 30 and 10 o'clock at night

490
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:05,140
I had diarrhea and really strong pains in my stomach.

491
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:15,830
It was like old symptom and the diarrhea smelled like a vomit and I slept very good at

492
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:24,180
night and in the morning the gas were gone. The sugar in the morning was 167.

493
01:05:25,930 --> 01:05:33,330
All the time I had a desire for lemon, something sour, something refreshing.

494
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:42,530
I usually drink water of soda with lemon and I found out that I don't take my feet anymore

495
01:05:42,630 --> 01:05:49,600
out of the covers and I sleep good and I didn't come in a messy bed in the morning.

496
01:05:52,770 --> 01:06:00,900
I wrote everything in mistakes like writing 4 instead of 5, April instead of May

497
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:12,500
and at about 3.30 to 4.30 I was breaking into really tired.

498
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:26,150
-Just for 1 hour or continuous?
-Yes like a break into this hour.

499
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:28,900
-You are talking still about the last seminar.

500
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,650
-I'm talking about after I tried Nux vomica the higher one and the low one because

501
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:34,330
we didn't check it afterwards.

502
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:51,230
In June I went back to LM and the sugar stayed from 111 which was the lowest one up to 298

503
01:06:51,330 --> 01:06:52,830
which was the highest one.

504
01:06:53,330 --> 01:06:54,570
-Without eating?

505
01:06:54,670 --> 01:07:04,900
-No, the 111 is without eating, the 298 is with eating, 2 hours after eating but it was annoying

506
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:12,730
because I did make a diet and if you eat only cheese and really little and to get up

507
01:07:12,830 --> 01:07:20,470
to such a sugar level it's really annoying. It's terrible. Anyway the pain was very

508
01:07:20,570 --> 01:07:32,720
strong in the joints and the numbness in the feet was strong and I felt when I wake up in

509
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:35,070
the morning, my circulation didn't work.

510
01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:53,550
When I rubbed the fingers was better and the stomach was still very bloated and gas and

511
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:59,640
then I had a new symptom. When I used to eat something, it doesn't matter what,

512
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:02,650
I just fell asleep in the middle of eating.

513
01:08:05,690 --> 01:08:08,550
-You used to have that?
-I never had that before.

514
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:11,340
-While eating?

515
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:19,730
-It started while eating and after eating I wanted to sleep. I couldn't hold my eyes open.

516
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:25,130
-During eating?

517
01:08:25,230 --> 01:08:40,070
-While I'm eating after a few bites, they become heavy.

518
01:08:42,070 --> 01:08:44,250
-Not that you have been sleeping really.

519
01:08:44,350 --> 01:08:50,320
-They become heavy and they close, they just fade away. It's very funny.

520
01:08:50,820 --> 01:09:01,720
I used to have this when I see a theater for instance, when I'm in a theater and it could be

521
01:09:01,820 --> 01:09:08,370
even a flamenco dance which is noisy or something very funny that everybody laughs

522
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:17,220
my eyes go down and I fall asleep and I start snoring. My husband does like this to me.

523
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:29,950
I think it's the light because usually the stage is lighted and I'm in the dark

524
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:41,420
and that bothers my eyes and they become heavy and I just go. My kids and husband hate that.

525
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:53,630
They make sure that I stay awake but not in a cinema, just in a real stage.

526
01:09:55,170 --> 01:10:04,280
For instance in Cats I slept the whole show, even in Star light express where they go on top of you

527
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:06,170
with all the sketch and the noise.

528
01:10:08,670 --> 01:10:15,570
-What is cats?
-Cats is a famous musical.

529
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:20,380
-It's a musical.
-Yes and I slept very good.

530
01:10:22,130 --> 01:10:25,740
-If you want to sleep, you go to a musical and have a deep sleep.

531
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:29,800
-Did you sleep in a flamenco show? I slept in a flamenco show too.

532
01:10:33,050 --> 01:10:35,140
-It's a good symptom, why should we take it away?

533
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:44,720
-It depends what the play is all about. Anyways I have the same thing while I'm eating.

534
01:10:47,970 --> 01:10:59,120
I had suddenly a wandering pain like the right ankle and then the left knee and then a cramp

535
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:15,060
in my left calp and dry mouth at night, about 11-12 midnight and numbness in the tips of the fingers.

536
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:42,450
Then in August I started having again the sweating thing. I was getting extra sweat,

537
01:11:42,550 --> 01:11:54,700
when I walk outside and it's hot I don't get sweat and then when I go into a room with air condition,

538
01:11:54,800 --> 01:12:03,950
then I start sweating. I found it a bit funny because I should sweat when I do exertion in the heat,

539
01:12:04,050 --> 01:12:10,800
not when it's already cold and nice, it's dripping like a shower.

540
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:20,450
-But if you have not exerted yourself, you are just in a cold room?

541
01:12:20,550 --> 01:12:30,050
-Then I don't sweat. I need a fanning. If I can put some rubric in 4 that's fanning.

542
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:42,800
I need air moving. Even if I have an air condition. And it's also ameliorating everything.

543
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:58,290
The normal stool that I have is usually half an hour after I wake up and when I start moving already.

544
01:12:58,390 --> 01:13:07,030
I wake up, do whatever I need and within half an hour I have to go to the toilet or at about 9 o'clock

545
01:13:07,130 --> 01:13:19,780
in the morning. The stool used to be very smelly. I always try to find the smell, to say how it smells,

546
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:28,040
I don't. It stings, I don't know how to say it. I remember my husband once said,

547
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:31,220
a few years ago, it smells like a dead body sometimes.

548
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:39,500
Now it doesn't smell anymore that much, I took another remedy in the mean time

549
01:13:39,970 --> 01:13:54,620
but it was like force able with urination together, it's like a diarrhea, yellow like a baby

550
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:58,240
and sometimes it's a bit fat and floating, that's the normal one.

551
01:14:00,590 --> 01:14:03,330
-Do you have an excessive thirst with this high blood sugar.

552
01:14:03,430 --> 01:14:08,680
-I don't have thirst at all, I have to force myself to drink twice the day.

553
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:12,080
I could pass the whole day without drinking one glass.

554
01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:18,610
-Do you have any dryness in your mouth?
-Yes in the evening.

555
01:14:18,710 --> 01:14:21,160
-In the evening your mouth becomes very dry?

556
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:27,510
-Yes, very dry. Some days yes, some days not but if I do, usually it is in the evening.

557
01:14:28,510 --> 01:14:33,510
Yesterday I had it but maybe because I was flying over and everything.

558
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:37,210
Usually is around 9, 10 o'clock at night.

559
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:50,180
I was already on LM 7 and I had cramps on my feet and cramps on my back and on the side

560
01:15:06,710 --> 01:15:13,700
and in the morning I had an eruption on the tip of my nose which is a symptom that

561
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:20,160
came many times the few months that I took the Nux vomica.

562
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:22,540
I used to have it, every time I took it.

563
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:25,740
-Real eruption or you just had a little...

564
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:42,840
-No, a little red one on the tip. I started to have crying comes out when I think about something,

565
01:15:46,090 --> 01:16:00,990
anything that makes me feel, grows the feeling up. For instance we have in Israel a show

566
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:07,240
that everybody listens to the radio. She is a woman ,she is a psychiatrist

567
01:16:07,340 --> 01:16:11,490
and people call her and tell their problems. All the time there are problems of children

568
01:16:11,590 --> 01:16:21,330
and people that you can hear the remedy and she tells them, take this pill, take that pill

569
01:16:21,430 --> 01:16:26,830
and makes me so annoyed because I think if they would have taken this kid to a homeopath

570
01:16:26,930 --> 01:16:34,710
within few days it's over. And she sends a kid of 7 or 8 to take psychiatric medications

571
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:42,440
which is crazy and I used to really cry over it, it makes me nervous.

572
01:16:42,540 --> 01:16:45,240
-Just throw a stone on the television.

573
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:48,840
-It's not on the television, it's on the radio, every day for 3 hours.

574
01:16:52,540 --> 01:17:07,160
On the 5th of August I took the 200 Nux and I tried to move it a little bit and in the evening I took 1M

575
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:16,910
and in the morning I went out shopping, I was very happy and I had an urge to clean

576
01:17:17,010 --> 01:17:21,110
and throw everything out of the house, which usually I don't do.

577
01:17:21,210 --> 01:17:27,340
I'm usually a collector, I collect things and I decided to throw things and then on the 8th of August

578
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:35,190
I had so many days which were really intolerable, nightmares.

579
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:40,030
-What do you mean? You had nightmares?

580
01:17:40,130 --> 01:17:48,250
-I had anxiety and stress about coming here to Alonissos, I decided to change the hotel

581
01:17:48,350 --> 01:17:55,000
to go to live here in Melia Bay so I can walk but then I was very upset because I thought that

582
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:59,600
I have to tell Costas that I want to move and I didn't want to offend.

583
01:18:02,850 --> 01:18:06,690
-Just a little thing like that?
-Just a little thing bothers me so much.

584
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:14,190
-You don't have to think twice, if you want to change you just tell them, I don't come.

585
01:18:15,690 --> 01:18:23,010
-It bothers me. Anyway I woke up with very bad mood and I felt that something bothers me

586
01:18:23,110 --> 01:18:34,700
in the background and another new symptom is that normally I don't have hair.

587
01:18:36,950 --> 01:18:44,350
I have little bit on the left side and none on the right side and the last few months with the Nux

588
01:18:44,450 --> 01:18:51,350
I start growing hair. It grew like a normal person.

589
01:18:51,450 --> 01:18:52,600
-Finally.

590
01:18:52,700 --> 01:19:03,480
-And I felt sweat again, now it changed but I felt like I have smelling and sweat more.

591
01:19:07,230 --> 01:19:15,730
Around the 12th of August I just give this report that I gave you.

592
01:19:18,730 --> 01:19:21,730
On the 12th of August I decided to take Causticum.

593
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:26,230
-What potency?

594
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:34,180
-LM. I didn't have the courage to take something else. With LM I can stop it if it's too bad

595
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:45,030
and it was very bad. I took LM 2 and the sugar still went up because I already had 200 sugar

596
01:19:45,530 --> 01:19:52,430
by that time and the sugar continued going up. The next day I took LM 3 and within 2 hours

597
01:19:52,530 --> 01:20:03,260
the sugar went down to 130 and since then I took twice the day LM 3 and the sugar

598
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:09,610
was maximum 147 after eating, which normally went up to 300.

599
01:20:11,860 --> 01:20:21,180
At night I had a very bad dream. It had something to do with jealousy with my husband

600
01:20:22,030 --> 01:20:26,060
and I was very furious and the whole day I walked with this feeling,

601
01:20:26,810 --> 01:20:29,780
very cross with him and it continued.

602
01:20:31,530 --> 01:20:46,010
I had such an uneasiness and stress in a stress the whole day. In the 15th of August at 2.30

603
01:20:46,110 --> 01:20:53,610
in the afternoon I felt very bad, pains in my stomach and diarrhea like I ate something rotten.

604
01:20:55,860 --> 01:21:02,780
It's an old symptom, I had this a few times before and since then I didn't have any diarrhea at all

605
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:05,860
except one wedding in the 2d of September.

606
01:21:06,860 --> 01:21:15,180
The stool stopped being a diarrhea, since the Causticum, which I had diarrhea all my life

607
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:22,730
and it changed that, I have soft stool but formed, not a diarrhea anymore, still the same hours.

608
01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:39,280
Just after I took the Causticum the left eye all the time wet, all the time with tears

609
01:21:39,530 --> 01:21:54,510
and a kind of swelling on the top and underneath a red eruption and then on the 15th started

610
01:21:54,610 --> 01:22:01,360
like a crust on my nose which I took out and it continued all the time for about a month.

611
01:22:03,860 --> 01:22:14,700
The sugar went down from 200 to 150 in the morning. On the 20th of August I went up in LM 4

612
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:24,930
and still the eye is dripping and the joints are still painful and the crust in the nose

613
01:22:25,030 --> 01:22:32,180
on the 22 is still there and then I decided not to take anymore Causticum because

614
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:41,760
I didn't feel good and I thought about calling you and see maybe I go back to Nux vomica

615
01:22:41,860 --> 01:22:46,950
and I decided to leave it, to let the body do whatever it feels like and stop with everything.

616
01:22:48,730 --> 01:22:50,230
-That's the best.

617
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:59,100
-Then within few days the sugar started going down, down and stabilized

618
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:14,100
and from the 22 of August it was 142, 117,126,160 and I had already 2 days without a remedy and

619
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:28,780
the sugar was 140 in the morning and I had a very strong desire for soft boiled eggs

620
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:31,530
with butter and bread.

621
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:41,890
Then I had a lot of problems in my stomach. I had a feeling that there is something

622
01:23:41,990 --> 01:23:51,640
that grows in my stomach and pushes my bladder and I had an urge all the time to go on

623
01:23:51,740 --> 01:23:55,390
the toilet but nothing came out, very little.

624
01:23:55,490 --> 01:24:01,770
It was not like cystitis. It was something different because I had a few times cystitis.

625
01:24:04,990 --> 01:24:06,240
It was not like that.

626
01:24:07,090 --> 01:24:12,560
It was like something big growing and pushing like you are in the beginning of pregnancy.

627
01:24:16,310 --> 01:24:26,460
Then I had also a heart burn like pushing up and pushing down and I thought that maybe

628
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:33,990
it was a stool that didn't come out because I didn't have my diarrhea, I didn't clean up enough

629
01:24:34,090 --> 01:24:42,810
like I'm used to and I had a lot of gas that came out with very nice voice.

630
01:24:55,310 --> 01:25:00,420
Then the whole system of the sugar went differently than it used to be before.

631
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:07,660
Before if I would not eat for 14 hours, it used to got the lowest and then after 2-4 hours after eating

632
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:17,130
it goes higher. In this time it used to go down during the day and go a little bit after eating

633
01:25:17,230 --> 01:25:22,880
but then at night it used to go up and in the morning it used to be very high.

634
01:25:22,980 --> 01:25:40,130
It was with no rules, even if I didn't eat for 14 hours it was going differently, not like it used to be

635
01:25:40,230 --> 01:25:56,480
with the Nux or normal. On the 29th of August I had a very strong pain in my back like a flu and

636
01:25:56,580 --> 01:26:04,060
I got my period. I'm in menopause and every time I take a remedy, I get back my period.

637
01:26:09,810 --> 01:26:21,190
I gave you all. There was one time at the end of August that I got very very angry at work

638
01:26:21,290 --> 01:26:27,110
and I thought I'm going to have a heart attack and then later on I got angry and I thought

639
01:26:27,210 --> 01:26:35,360
I'm going to have a stroke. It went up to my head for a few days and the blood pressure

640
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:42,460
was quite OK and on the 1st of September the sugar started going down, the levels.

641
01:26:43,460 --> 01:26:54,940
I didn't have any Causticum anymore and it went 136, 123, 124.Then after food 196.

642
01:26:55,040 --> 01:27:07,110
Then on the 6th of September was 136, 129, 110, 109, 106 really nice and in the holiday

643
01:27:07,210 --> 01:27:12,720
I had a very good meal and I said, no I'm going to check it. I eat something sweet and

644
01:27:12,820 --> 01:27:20,980
I wanted to see if it went up and it did not go up much. It went up to 164 which previously

645
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:30,180
used to go up to 300 but I felt it's on the good way. I was quite happy with this Causticum thing

646
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:36,780
and mentally I felt better, I just didn't like to go to work anymore.

647
01:27:37,310 --> 01:27:45,320
I wanted time for myself, I wanted to take care of myself more and I didn't want to care for anybody.

648
01:27:45,820 --> 01:27:48,970
I had a wedding coming, my daughter got married last Tuesday.

649
01:27:49,070 --> 01:27:50,270
-Very good.

650
01:27:50,370 --> 01:27:59,770
-And I had a new grand son 2 months ago, so it was... First the grandson and then the wedding

651
01:27:59,870 --> 01:28:01,520
and I was quite happy.

652
01:28:01,620 --> 01:28:05,270
-This is usual today?

653
01:28:06,370 --> 01:28:12,820
-No, the grand son is from the other daughter. She is married 3 years already.

654
01:28:17,570 --> 01:28:26,430
And the sweating comes back after the Causticum and a very nice things happened to me

655
01:28:26,530 --> 01:28:34,180
while I took the Nux vomica. First time in my life I like to walk, I start walking a lot.

656
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:38,030
I had so much energy and I wanted to walk all the time.

657
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:39,930
-Fast or slow?

658
01:28:40,030 --> 01:28:48,430
-Fast, only fast and I love it. I think it's going down now after the Causticum but with the Nux

659
01:28:48,530 --> 01:28:54,220
it was beautiful because I never liked it. I enjoyed walking but not that much.

660
01:28:54,320 --> 01:29:06,280
I really enjoyed it. I think that's all. The memory is terrible.

661
01:29:07,530 --> 01:29:14,280
And a new symptom. I had here in this part of my head scratching.

662
01:29:15,570 --> 01:29:19,870
I asked my husband to look if there is eruption, he said there is no eruption, nothing.

663
01:29:19,970 --> 01:29:39,290
I was scratching like I have lice. Even after washing the hair. On the 12th of September I had here

664
01:29:39,390 --> 01:29:54,050
all red and burning in the left eye and the period was not moving much in the beginning

665
01:29:57,050 --> 01:30:03,800
and I was very nervous. My daughter was nervous because of the wedding and I was nervous.

666
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:12,050
The only thing that calmed me was holding this baby. It's like it moved me to another world.

667
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:21,140
Holding and nothing happened around. It isolated me from all the problems around.

668
01:30:23,140 --> 01:30:26,640
-It was the first time you became grand mother?
-Yes.

669
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:39,390
Now the only thing I can tell about right now, mentally I don't like to work in my office.

670
01:30:40,140 --> 01:30:46,240
I have all these volunteers, there is a lot of problems going with the government towards

671
01:30:46,340 --> 01:30:53,990
volunteering, a lot of problems for me. I just avoid them, I go away because I feel like I'm going

672
01:30:58,140 --> 01:31:07,650
to have a stroke physically. I feel that it makes me so crazy because it's not right, they do things,

673
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:11,420
they throw people out of the country, they don't let them in the country,

674
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:12,720
they do so many things.

675
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:19,120
It's one woman there, a clark, who decides for what has to do with people like she wants,

676
01:31:19,220 --> 01:31:25,300
like it's her private business and it's so much annoying.

677
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:33,950
-Was anybody known to you who wanted to enter the country and they did not allow him?

678
01:31:34,050 --> 01:31:43,790
-Of course, all the people that I work with. It's young people who come to see the country

679
01:31:43,890 --> 01:31:50,840
they stay in kibbutz. She just decided that, it's kind of a plot actually.

680
01:31:53,090 --> 01:31:56,790
You know that they know that they do all kinds of plots when it's the interest of this one

681
01:31:56,890 --> 01:32:01,720
or that one and it's money involved. They like to bring foreign workers.

682
01:32:02,220 --> 01:32:08,370
There is a lot of people who gain money out of foreign workers and the volunteers who come

683
01:32:08,470 --> 01:32:14,290
for little money, just to enjoy time and it helps a lot and they don't want them because

684
01:32:14,390 --> 01:32:18,890
if the farmers didn't have them, they take foreign workers and they gain money.

685
01:32:20,170 --> 01:32:29,040
So what they did, they influenced this woman, just before the election and she took out all kind

686
01:32:29,140 --> 01:32:37,290
of rules and things and she told them in the airport whenever any check of (?) come in,

687
01:32:37,390 --> 01:32:41,140
just report them. Immediately put them on the plane back home.

688
01:32:41,890 --> 01:32:47,540
It's young students who hardly have any money and you don't do these things.

689
01:32:47,640 --> 01:33:00,470
I could not stand that. So I had to be at home, I had to be at work, when this happened

690
01:33:01,970 --> 01:33:10,620
because it was too difficult. They used to call me at 4 o'clock and say listen there is a group of yours,

691
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:14,090
she said not to take them in but I'm letting them in.

692
01:33:15,090 --> 01:33:20,640
So she used to work with me till they caught her and they gave her a lot of problems.

693
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:30,390
I found out that I go crazy at work, it's only problems all the time which I go really mad.

694
01:33:31,670 --> 01:33:44,140
My health is ruined, so I decided to avoid as much as possible and friends of mine started dying.

695
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:50,790
This man doesn't wake up, the other one got suddenly cancer and

696
01:33:50,890 --> 01:33:58,870
too many things happened in the last few months and I decided that in order maybe

697
01:33:58,970 --> 01:34:04,050
to be healthy or in case I wouldn't finish this millennium, just to go out.

698
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:14,040
So I'm coming here and then about a month ago I booked for my husband and me

699
01:34:14,140 --> 01:34:20,140
I had to go but where shall I go, every world is crazy. So I decided in New Zealand.

700
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:28,390
That's far enough and it's still nice, the nature and the people are beautiful.

701
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:34,390
So we go in New Zealand and Australia, I took all my savings.

702
01:34:35,390 --> 01:34:36,890
-You are happy now?

703
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:45,640
-After that I felt a little bit better and I just had this wedding to finish with.

704
01:34:46,390 --> 01:34:50,470
I enjoyed it a lot and it was beautiful, my daughter enjoyed it.

705
01:34:50,970 --> 01:34:54,510
She had it exactly like she wanted it.
-OK.

706
01:35:20,260 --> 01:35:21,760
Can you switch off the lights?

707
01:35:36,510 --> 01:35:50,260
I want to know who prescribed wait? 73. Who prescribed a new remedy?

708
01:35:52,760 --> 01:36:02,860
Who prescribed the same remedy? Who prescribed the same potency? Very good.

709
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:17,750
I'm very happy with the progress of the class, this is the idea. I don't know if for the same reasons

710
01:36:17,850 --> 01:36:32,930
as are my reasons but still the decision is the same. So it doesn't matter, the results matter.

711
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:47,080
She is a sensitive individual with reactions to different potencies, so give time.

712
01:36:47,180 --> 01:36:52,580
She is impatient, she has done it before, she takes other remedies, she interferes

713
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:57,330
with the reactions of the remedies, so you don't know really what is the result of the

714
01:36:57,430 --> 01:37:04,580
previous remedy or the now remedy. I have some result, I stop the remedy, I feel better, I start again,

715
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:13,580
then you have to suspend all remedies and wait to see this organism how he settles down

716
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:17,430
and what kind of a picture eventually produces.

717
01:37:17,930 --> 01:37:25,630
The reason is why? Because we have some easy disturbances.

718
01:37:26,590 --> 01:37:30,570
The pancreas one time is working, one time is not working.

719
01:37:35,510 --> 01:37:45,010
This kind of changing of the organism so easily, it needs some time to settle down.

720
01:37:47,010 --> 01:38:01,180
The advice should be don't take any remedy, take placebo, why not? It makes good.
