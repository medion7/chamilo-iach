1
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:24,200
This is a good teaching case, very good teaching case.

2
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,520
It is teaching us a lot of things.

3
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:36,170
How would you evaluate what is taking place in this man?

4
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:57,790
If this man was given the correct remedy from the very beginning,

5
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:05,310
would he have arrived at that stage?
-No.

6
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:14,560
-So he could have avoided it with the right remedy, he could have avoided all this.

7
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,220
But now humanity understands that, understands Homeopathy it can prevent all this?

8
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,720
It doesn't seem; otherwise we would have schools, we would have Universities,

9
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:35,880
10 years of studying and then after 10 years, you come out and you treat.

10
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:45,620
Now you come to a seminar, 2-4 weeks, you go to another seminar, let me know everything,

11
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:53,540
just tell us more. What to tell more, there is no more to say.

12
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:02,020
There are a few things that we have to understand and to have them in mind

13
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:09,290
when you are treating and then study your Materia Medica and then under supervision

14
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,640
you see what is happening and what is happening with the right treatment

15
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:17,380
and eventually you become a homeopathic physician.

16
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:27,880
And that's why I have all these problems which I have.

17
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,040
What is happening in this man now?

18
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:51,040
Most probably he has not received the right remedy on the right sequence of remedies.

19
00:02:52,200 --> 00:03:00,020
Maybe one remedy would not be enough, maybe a sequence of remedies, maybe 2-3 remedies

20
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,700
he needs but in the right sequence.

21
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,690
Have we started correctly?

22
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:11,040
No, we started incorrectly and unfortunately...

23
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:20,100
Why Tuberculinum? There are some people who they teach first you give Syphilinum,

24
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,450
Medorrhinum and Tuberculinum to clear up the miasms.

25
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:30,020
To everybody first and then you start proceeding with the case.

26
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,370
But before you take the case, give these 3 remedies to clear up.

27
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:43,190
You see how he is clearing? For 5-7 years he is clearing up and still he is not clear.

28
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:51,540
He has 40 bowel movements, it is not clear, 7 years and it's not clear.

29
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:59,520
That's why I get mad, not at people never. I've never spoken against anybody.

30
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,380
I'm speaking about principles, don't misunderstand me.

31
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:11,190
I could have made a mistake like that easily but I would have reasons and I would explain

32
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,190
why I gave Tuberculinum.

33
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,360
And I would like to know the reasons why he gave Tuberculinum.

34
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:24,880
The only remedy that was given with some reason was Phosphorus, as we shall see.

35
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:30,790
But is this a Phosphorus case? That is the question that we have to face eventually.

36
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,540
What is the remedy?

37
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,210
It's a great puzzle.

38
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:50,710
The first question that comes to my mind is why this whole thing started.

39
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:56,950
He says it started at the age of 31, I understand it is 7 years.

40
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:02,520
I want to know what happened at the age of 30, 29 just before.

41
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:10,610
What took place and he prevents my question further and he says, wait a moment

42
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:18,780
the actual pains had started when I was 14, I had the tenderness.

43
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:27,290
Do you understand also another thing? What happened with the peritonitis?

44
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:33,860
He went into peritonitis. What happened?

45
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:41,520
After given Phosphorus repeated doses 1M, 10M, again 10M then he went into peritonitis.

46
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:48,360
He had this flare up, this severe pain on the right side of the abdomen with fever

47
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:53,190
and he went to the hospital with peritonitis.

48
00:05:53,290 --> 00:06:02,540
What happened?
-Perforation.

49
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:07,270
-Why perforation, it has anything to do with Phosphorus?

50
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,350
-Ulceration.

51
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:13,970
-Ulceration has anything to do with Phosphorus?

52
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:22,120
We don't know but we may say it has to do with Phosphorus, repeating Phosphorus

53
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,130
without being needed.

54
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,080
I want to know what happened before that.

55
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:52,700
Why this man is so severely affected in his physical body? Why?

56
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:02,710
Let us hear the story.
-I had a terrible aggravation.

57
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:08,980
My wife thought I was gonna die, I was so weak but I kept working all the time

58
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:16,270
and studying Homeopathy, 30 hours the week just study, study, study and work at the same time.

59
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:23,860
-When did you get involved with the spiritual group, that means when you were 20,

60
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:30,120
can you say what group it was?
-It was transcendental meditation.

61
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:35,020
-In the beginning you felt good with the meditation?

62
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:46,270
-I felt very good, I became a teacher, I devoted my life fully trying to help the world from suffering.

63
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:51,330
-Can you say you were disappointed from that? Disillusioned?

64
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:56,940
Here we have an important information. What is the important information?

65
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,540
-Disillusioned.
-No, it is not.

66
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:20,280
He wants to help the world, the humanity. He got disillusioned yes but he wants to help the humanity.

67
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:27,220
So you start forming an aspect of the personality of the person.

68
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:40,190
He is 20, you can not say he went there because he thought logically it is better...

69
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:45,610
No, I don't want logical explanation. He is 20, he wants to help the humanity

70
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:55,290
and this is the tendency of many young people of today that have been disillusioned

71
00:08:55,390 --> 00:09:06,360
with the situation in which we live in this world and they become either anarchists or guru prone etc.

72
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:12,310
And they want to change the situation, we are in a terrible situation, we are going into pieces,

73
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:18,100
this is my evaluation of the world at the moment. We are going with great speed into pieces.

74
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,050
Now this everybody knows.

75
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:34,000
What he is telling is, he is a young man I can't live in this world, I have to find something

76
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:40,800
and then some guru comes and says here I am, I'm going to give you enlightenment,

77
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:46,150
breathe in and out. This is not...

78
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:53,760
I know everyone here has gone through experiences and I have gone through the experiences,

79
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:59,780
whatever is the experience, one way or another. Why we went?

80
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,500
Because the world is in that state. Why the world is in that state?

81
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:15,690
A crazy world, why? I wrote a book about it, you can read it.

82
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:27,590
It is a very bad state of health. Humanity at the moment, especially the Western civilization

83
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:34,420
is at the worse state of health in general. That's why we see what we see

84
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,480
and not healthy things are happening.

85
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:44,650
So this man wants to help the humanity, it is an aspect of this man.

86
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:53,080
Most probably he was teared into pieces by looking at something that helped him very much,

87
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:58,110
affected him very much. What are these things, we want to know.

88
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,370
We want to understand more of the personality now,

89
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:07,260
what is this person who is having that disease?

90
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:16,180
Can we find the remedy that fits that personality? Is it an Aurum, is Argentum nitricum or what?

91
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:27,920
-In 1978.
-That is 10 years ago.

92
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:34,120
-Disappointed and feeling of great loss because this was my whole life.

93
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:42,670
-The tenderness started really to bother you how long after this disillusionment?

94
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:45,760
-About 2 years after.

95
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:52,340
But what happened was that my wife and I, didn't have any children until 1981

96
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,730
and I was in the labor with my wife and that was devastating for me.

97
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:08,420
I got fright, the suffering upset me so much that I didn't even think,

98
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:13,010
I had no thoughts about sex for a year and a half. Never.

99
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:17,930
I just could even think of inflicting that pain again and being involved in that pain.

100
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:31,670
You see how the information is coming? The information is not coming through question,

101
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:37,170
it is forth coming by his own volition. He gives information which is very important.

102
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:41,760
What he suggests, the first time he says I want to help the humanity,

103
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:51,110
so we see the element of want to help, the sympathetic element, which we call it.

104
00:12:51,910 --> 00:13:01,340
And as a second information comes again that sympathetic element, he is in labor with his wife

105
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,420
and he is devastated, the experience lasted for one and a half year,

106
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:13,470
he can't even think of having sex, inflicting pain.

107
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:29,460
That is an over sensitivity towards certain things, towards pain, pain from others,

108
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:39,100
they can not tolerate. We have another point of the aspect of the personality now.

109
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,210
-Crying?

110
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:49,010
-Crying also yes. The experience is so intense.

111
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,760
He says for one and a half year I didn't have a thought of sex.

112
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:10,170
He is a man who is indifferent to sex. So for one and a half year he has not thoughts of sex.

113
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:18,920
So we would like to know how much indifferent to sex he is eventually, to evaluate that information.

114
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:25,100
If this is a man who has desire for sex, the sex desire is very strong and

115
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:32,100
because of that incident that desire is taken away, that means the effect is pathological.

116
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:46,610
It is not normal that a man will see a labor and behave in this way and have this effect,

117
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:51,960
unless he is over sensitive towards that aspect, the suffering of the human being.

118
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:57,350
It's not normal, otherwise all the gynecologists would not been able to have sex

119
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,690
for the rest of their life.

120
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:09,700
And gynecologists are not famous for that.

121
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:17,930
I don't know if there is any gynecologist here but the information is that

122
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:20,360
they are not famous for that.

123
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:33,680
Therefore this becomes pathology, it is a pathological sensitivity, we write it down,

124
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:37,200
we keep it as information.

125
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:47,370
The sympathetic element, affected by seeing people suffering.

126
00:15:53,050 --> 00:16:01,210
I hope you excuse me for being over sincere.

127
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:12,440
-I've been involved in that pain and all women I would look at them and think, my god,

128
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:20,110
this pain, too much pain and then my daughter wasn't a very well baby.

129
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:23,950
So I slept 2 hours the night and I would be up all night with the baby

130
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:30,860
because my wife would feed her and I would walk on the floor all night long, trying to help.

131
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:35,520
I was completely broken because I didn't know how to help her and that upset me.

132
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:42,020
-Why you went into the labor with your wife? You wanted to help, just of curiosity?

133
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,020
-I wanted to be there to give her support.

134
00:16:53,790 --> 00:17:02,140
You see how I try still to confirm, why you went there, what you wanted to do?

135
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:13,190
It was curiosity perhaps? I just put a question that may minimize the impact

136
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:16,790
of the symptom that he is relating.

137
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,950
I do not jump into conclusions and say this is this remedy.

138
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:27,950
No, I want to test it, is it or it is not?

139
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:34,600
And I'm ready to see the symptomatology and to reevaluate the whole case from

140
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,460
another point of view all together.

141
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,450
Because by that time, as you understand, I know the remedy, I understand the remedy

142
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:50,300
but you will see the questions. You will see what happens.

143
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:17,390
-That she would feel pain and you wanted to support her, hold her hand and things like that.

144
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:27,770
-Yes she almost bite my thumb. She needs support, particularly during pain,

145
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:30,020
she doesn't like pain.

146
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:38,220
-She doesn't like pain and you were there hearing her screaming and you could see

147
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,770
the labor actually.
-Yes and crying.

148
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:48,350
-You were crying and sobbing?
-I wasn't sobbing.

149
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:53,100
-Did you feel at this moment that the doctors were doing something wrong

150
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,700
or they did not handled properly the case or you felt helpless?

151
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,850
-I felt helpless, completely helpless.

152
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:09,000
-That nobody could do anything at this situation, she was just in the hands of the god.

153
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:14,500
-That's right and I decided that I will learn something so this will never happen again.

154
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:24,400
Another point. I will learn something, so this will never happen again.

155
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:36,190
What is important in this? Why do I ask about the doctors?

156
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:09,010
Is he blaming the doctor, does he know better than the doctors or not?

157
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,590
-It's not that.

158
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:26,370
-If there is a kind of indignation.
-Watch people or watch the situation.

159
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,340
-You are close.

160
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:50,300
You see different remedies will react in a different way during the same set up.

161
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:59,630
If he is Nux vomica, he will not cry at this moment most probably.

162
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:08,620
He will give help perhaps to the doctors, can you give something to stop the pain?

163
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,470
He will comment something.

164
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:28,820
If he is Phosphorus, what he will do?
-He goes away.

165
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:38,550
-He may faint Phosphorus under these circumstances, he may try to help the doctors

166
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:46,780
to help his wife, he has to do something to help the doctors. What can we do?

167
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,110
Can we do something? Wait a moment, something has to be done.

168
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:58,720
He stays paralyzed there and he says god I do not want this to happen again.

169
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:04,360
I learn something now, so this will not happen again.

170
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:13,360
That is a reaction which is unique. For every individual, that is his uniqueness.

171
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:18,800
We have to take it and evaluate that symptom.

172
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:30,450
Yes but we do not intellectualize, we do not explain. We say what happened?

173
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:39,310
I stayed there helpless and I said to myself I don't want this to happen again.

174
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:49,700
We have an information that he went into a transcendental meditation

175
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:54,700
because he wanted to help humanity, he can not stand the pain of others

176
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,060
and he wants to help humanity.

177
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:03,310
Most probably this is the explanation, we'll hear more.

178
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:23,790
-Then we had the baby, the baby wasn't well, I said I have to find something,

179
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:26,280
I have to learn something so I can help.

180
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:32,450
-To do something so that this will not happen again. Did she have caesarian?

181
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:35,530
-No. She had very long labor, very painful.

182
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:37,450
-She was teared in the perineum?

183
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:48,370
-Yes and the baby came out pressed down into the coccyx for hours,

184
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:51,150
so it was very painful for her.

185
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:55,370
-This daughter was your daughter?
-Yes.

186
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:58,280
-You said you lost your daughter.

187
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:03,620
-That was my first daughter and then we had another baby in 1984 and the day

188
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:09,210
before she was going to be born, they told us she can't live.

189
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:16,800
And then I learned Homeopathy to try to help the children and I couldn't help her

190
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,910
because she couldn't live.

191
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:30,120
-She couldn't live why?
-She had no brain.

192
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:37,970
-She was missing a piece of brain.
-I can't think of the name.

193
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:54,030
-This incident did not disturb you as much as the labor? The labor was a terrible experience?

194
00:24:54,130 --> 00:25:06,640
-The labor was devastating. The loss of the baby, I cried a lot and still today upsets me.

195
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:25,390
If you are observant, he says I cried a lot and still today upsets me. How much?

196
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:45,300
Very much, medium or very little?
-Upsets him a lot.

197
00:25:46,710 --> 00:26:03,500
-Upsets him a lot. Who says medium? Who says a lot? Who says little?

198
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:13,540
We have some objective things here. First of all he cried.

199
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:21,370
The fact that he cried it means that he brought out his grief by crying and that is a good symptom.

200
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:29,710
It is not a very deep grief which is affecting the organism, it is affecting the eyes

201
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:33,560
and the lacrimal duct and it is getting out.

202
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:38,290
This is a good reaction, natural reaction for a person to cry.

203
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:46,870
The baby is not born, therefore he is not connected with the child, he is not connected really.

204
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:52,710
Therefore from that objective fact, the grief is usually minimized,

205
00:26:52,810 --> 00:27:02,280
unless one does not have any child and he is 44 years old and he can not have another child.

206
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:05,780
That can be a big grief but that's not the situation.

207
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:12,880
This is a situation where he has a child already and they told him it is born dead.

208
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:24,040
The third observation is that in spite of saying it is upsetting me,

209
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:30,950
the actual physical condition is not changing; it remains the same.

210
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:38,470
Therefore we do not have a real grief to treat.

211
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:46,040
Our mind should not go to grief because of that reason, maybe there is grief for another

212
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,640
reason but not for that reason.

213
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:17,970
-Before you said you went to transcendental meditation, what led you there?

214
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:22,710
Can you give me a little bit of the history of your life?

215
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:29,620
-As a child I was very sensitive child, I had a lot of religious feelings,

216
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:38,040
I used to go to church a lot, I felt very close to god, I was going to be a priest

217
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:44,620
and that's all I wanted to do, to be devoted to god and just do that.

218
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:52,370
-Since childhood. You were serious or you were playing with other children?

219
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:59,210
-I had these periods of intense devotional feelings and then I would have periods

220
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:08,790
of great wildness where I would shoplift, steal things, I would break into places

221
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:17,620
and I would do that and then with the religious feelings which overtook me,

222
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,870
I would never do that again.

223
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:26,290
Even today I have very wild tendency, when I have more energy, I'm very wild.

224
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:29,620
-What are you doing?

225
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:36,460
-Doing things that are very exciting that other people might not want to do.

226
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:43,050
I'll dance in public, in a shopping center.

227
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:56,870
So far we have been thinking of a remedy. Which is the remedy?

228
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:04,390
Causticum, very good. I told him the whole class will see the remedy, I promised him.

229
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:22,040
What he is saying now at a certain moment I was praying, I was serious, not exactly.

230
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:30,230
Why I'm thinking that? The possibility of Aurum. Was it an Aurum child?

231
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:39,530
He said he was praying though the feelings of praying were not the feelings of Aurum

232
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:46,120
because Aurum does not go so easily into ecstasy.

233
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:52,120
It is first the deep depression and then the relief through praying.

234
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:59,980
He says he is a character who is mixed, he goes to extremes.

235
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:08,570
I would say an extreme character, he goes and steals and then he prays and then he goes

236
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:16,170
and begs into places and then he prays. He goes to extremes, an extremist.

237
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:35,660
But what he says is when I have a lot of energy, I do things. What do you do?

238
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:43,410
I get up and dance. A lot of energy, you get up and dance...

239
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:49,230
Which is the remedy that your mind goes to?
-Tarentula.

240
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:53,560
-Why Tarentula? Because he has done the other naughty things, mischievous things.

241
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:02,300
Is this a case of Tarentula?
-No.

242
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,640
-Don't say no. I could not say no.

243
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:13,050
I want to know, I want to find out, is this a case of Tarentula, yes or no?

244
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:20,570
Maybe I was mislead so far. I did not explain well the situation.

245
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:28,820
-Tarentula dances when it hears music.

246
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:34,650
-Platina.

247
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:50,570
-Sepia likes to dance yes. We will see whether he is Sepia.

248
00:32:52,020 --> 00:33:04,160
-Lilium Tigrinum?
-Sepia is not so extreme.

249
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:11,630
-I do not know whether I have given you wrong impression about Sepia or other teachers

250
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:20,550
or the books but you have the impression that Sepia is a very dull individual,

251
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,820
without love, without affection.

252
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:35,240
We know that, it is like that and sometimes the mind is very foggy, very slow.

253
00:33:49,500 --> 00:34:02,550
This idea is completely wrong especially young Sepias, children of Sepia, 10, 20

254
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:11,560
that they have not been affected on this hormonal level and the mental-emotional level,

255
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:16,150
they are very excitable children.

256
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:32,300
They can do things, they can feel very happy, they can be the center of attention of friends

257
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:42,220
and they can reach a place where they will get up and dance and will be very vivid

258
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:51,650
and when the emotional level is not affected, you see a lot of love.

259
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:05,690
-I'll dance in public in shopping center, if I feel like it, that's what I will do.

260
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:12,640
Now if have 4 hours of sleep, now I wake 5 times a night,

261
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:18,130
but if for some reason I don't wake up for 4 hours and I get 4 hours unbroken sleep,

262
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:26,990
I wake up I feel more energy, I dance around. Wild energy.  I dance around.

263
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:33,330
My wife says this is god's way of stopping me from hanging off the chandeliers, Crohn's disease.

264
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:36,590
When I'm well, I'm like a bulldoze.

265
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:47,580
-What do you like to do? Mostly dancing or breaking in shops?

266
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:57,990
-I go into places and steal ice cream or I steal cigarettes and go and have a smoke.

267
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:00,740
-Do you smoke normally?

268
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:06,760
-Not now, this was when I was a child, I smoked until age 19, then I stopped.

269
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,570
-Now can you steal now, can you enter a shop?

270
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:12,410
-No, no.

271
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:15,990
-What actions can you do? You become violent at all?

272
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,990
-No.

273
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:24,170
-When you have the energy therefore, you have a lot of sexual energy?

274
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:28,990
-I asked my wife, tell me objectively because I have to tell George.

275
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:34,410
She said, right now you are not well. When you were well before,

276
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:41,530
you were Rambo, a lot of sexual energy.

277
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:47,930
Girlfriends that I used to have would tell me, you have just so much sexual energy.

278
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:57,080
-Now you do not because you are tired.
-Yes.

279
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:03,330
-When you have a lot of energy in general how do you spend this energy,

280
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:07,680
what mostly you will do to spend your energy?

281
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:20,490
These questions are for what? My mind has gone to the possibility of Tarentula.

282
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:27,510
From Causticum it has gone to the possibility of Tarentula and I'm trying to confirm Tarentula.

283
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:35,990
If this man is Tarentula, a lot of sexual energy, we know how much energy it has Tarentula,

284
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:45,910
how much sexual energy and excitement and loud music and vibrant music,

285
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:53,510
where they vibrate the doors and then they feel excited, happy and they can dance.

286
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,760
Also Tarentula is mischievous.

287
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,130
Tell me something, is he telling the truth?

288
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:31,180
Is he honest?
-Yes.

289
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:34,670
-Very honest, how do we know it?

290
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:43,340
Because he has mentioned things that somebody else would not dare to mention.

291
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,760
These countries like America and Canada they don't keep secrets.

292
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:54,160
They will give out the whole story.

293
00:38:54,260 --> 00:39:04,910
It is a healthy attitude to be able to balance with the craziness

294
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,940
which is going on in this part of the world.

295
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:18,840
Canada not so much as much as Berkley, Los Angeles, San Francisco...

296
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:54,690
Let us see if he is Tarentula.

297
00:39:56,180 --> 00:40:01,320
-What mostly you will do to spend your energy?

298
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:08,330
-I will organize things for Homeopathy because that is one of big loves of my life,

299
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:19,910
I'm involved with another meditation group, I work very hard on that, I have a project

300
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:30,940
where I raise money for deaf children, I work on that, things like that.

301
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:39,080
-What about dancing that you said before? This happens very seldom?

302
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:47,990
-Let's put it this way. The organization that I become involved does chanting

303
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:52,840
and I get a great feeling of ecstasy, joy, joy.

304
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:59,750
I have to get up and dance. Nobody in this group does this except me.

305
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:06,100
I dance, I just can't sit there, it's too much joy, excitement.

306
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:09,250
-Are you enjoying that?
-Yes.

307
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:14,070
-You don't feel any timidity because you do that?

308
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:20,490
-Initially I felt a little bit because nobody else did it, everybody was just sitting and chanting,

309
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:25,180
I was the only one who was dancing, I felt a little bit strange but now I don't care.

310
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:30,170
-Music brings you into a state of...

311
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:39,420
-The music I listen to is melancholic religious music and it gives me feelings of joyfulness

312
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,940
and devotional feelings.

313
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:51,900
If I'm not feeling so happy inside I put on George Harisson and he sings melancholic music,

314
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:59,330
how much he loves the Lord etc. and I just become overwhelmed with the feeling.

315
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:19,060
-The sound is too strong, too high or you want it normal?

316
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:25,830
-Normal, I don't like strong music, I find it agitating.

317
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:31,100
-Were you ever violent with somebody?

318
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:41,390
We were talking about Tarentula because of the getting up and the hearing of music and

319
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:49,310
the dancing on music but the kind of music is not the kind which Tarentula would like to.

320
00:42:49,410 --> 00:43:02,110
It is the opposite; so we can not confirm Tarentula but still I want another question.

321
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:08,250
I want further to find out and that's why I ask this.

322
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:17,850
-I don't have a tendency to violence, to attack people.

323
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:22,740
When I was young 18-19 I would get into fights but then where I come from,

324
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,410
everybody gets drunk and gets into fights.

325
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:38,490
-Tell me some more about yourself.

326
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:44,480
When you were a child you had this different kind of reactions?

327
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,400
-Yes I was alternating between the two.

328
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,600
-Too devotional and too...

329
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:55,260
-I would have devotional and I would have the other. There was periods when I was 9,10,11

330
00:43:55,360 --> 00:44:03,310
where I had sexual thoughts before going to sleep and that's the only way I would go to sleep.

331
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:08,990
I didn't know what sex was but I would just think about the sexual parts.

332
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:10,610
-What age?

333
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:22,420
-Starting about age 9, 10. That continued to about age 25, I suppose.

334
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:33,570
In which remedy do we see these sexual thoughts before going to bed in order

335
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:39,820
to be able to calm down and sleep, we see it, they have it a few remedies.

336
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,160
Mostly we see it in Staphysagria.

337
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:59,900
Is this then a Staphysagria case?
-No.

338
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:08,680
-Wait a moment, you didn't hear the whole story. Is this a Staphysagria case?

339
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:18,400
This is an idea, don't say no beforehand. Let us find out what is happening really.

340
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:26,130
We are trying to understand, the human being is so complex. Never mind how well we

341
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:34,700
may describe the picture, still we can have loose points which we don't know yet and we

342
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:41,370
have to be aware and not to lose important points and lose the thread.

343
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:47,450
Because the thread in this case is three remedies, in order to cure him.

344
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:51,730
If you lose the thread, you start with the wrong remedy, the wrong time.

345
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:59,540
You lose time, you lose energy, you have a lot of suffering and that's why we are asking

346
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,960
whether this is a Staphysagria case. Let's see.

347
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:11,970
-25 I suppose. It doesn't enter my mind anymore.

348
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:19,790
-Sexual thoughts do not come?
-Not very much really since age 25.

349
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:24,940
-What else about your character?

350
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:35,030
-I'm sympathetic, if I see somebody who is hurt and I can't do anything about it,

351
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:41,030
I  immediately go and help them, especially a child or if I see suffering.

352
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:48,490
Just before I came here I was watching a program of what happens in Burundi in Africa,

353
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:56,280
I saw people in the hospital with their hands chopped, it haunted me for days and days,

354
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:59,380
the thought would come back.

355
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:08,620
When I was watching that case of the little boy, inside oh no, no, it's going to be cured

356
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:17,710
and 5 billion other people, there is so much suffering and it bothers me so much.

357
00:47:19,390 --> 00:47:26,040
You see again and again he turns to the point of sympathetic.

358
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:37,360
And it comes out and he does not present this point because he wants Causticum

359
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:40,790
because he would have taken it himself.

360
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:45,280
Neither he has presented the case in such a way he thinks it's Causticum,

361
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:49,540
presents the case in a Causticum manner because he would have done it before

362
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,990
with the other homeopaths.

363
00:47:52,090 --> 00:48:00,780
What comes out therefore, it is genuine information, because he knows Homeopathy,

364
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:07,940
all these doctors with a lot of questions but from time to time,

365
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:15,730
his own initiative brings out information which is very important.

366
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:30,130
-It hurts your feelings and you cry?
-I cry.

367
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:33,700
-When you see injustice?

368
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:40,790
-Injustice really bothers me. That's one of the things that bothered me in the Organization

369
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:45,950
I was involved in. In 1975 I was working in the printing press

370
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:52,210
and there was some injustice went on and I got furiously angry,

371
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:56,890
I've never been so angry in my life. A week later I had asthma.

372
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:03,360
And it was only later that I realized it was from the anger.

373
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:14,300
-Did you express the anger? Did you voice it?
-Oh yes. Strongly, I curse a lot, I do now too.

374
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:26,470
-The people that you curse you were dependent upon?

375
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:35,110
You see again it comes strongly the case of Causticum, injustice but I put a question

376
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:40,460
straight forwardly to him, though the answer comes so strongly.

377
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,530
I have never been so angry in my life.

378
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:46,700
He says when I saw this injustice going on, I told them and all that.

379
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:52,110
I still want to see the degree of the intensity.

380
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:56,370
How much he risked when he did that?

381
00:49:56,470 --> 00:50:01,140
Did he risk his position in the Organization?

382
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:08,110
He saw an injustice, he couldn't hold himself, he knew if he would tell what he thought,

383
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:16,450
he had to leave. Did he go so far as that? That is a strong point.

384
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:19,390
So I'm going to ask about that now.

385
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:30,400
-The people that you cursed you were dependent upon financially?

386
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:35,190
-Yes, I depended upon them financially, that bothered me.

387
00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:37,780
I don't like to be in a position of dependence.

388
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:42,150
-But in spite of being dependent, you still curse them, you couldn't retain.

389
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:49,380
You felt that if I speak badly to them, then I will lose my work?

390
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:54,690
-I was too angry. In this Organization I was considered quite radical

391
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:56,390
because I would always speak my mind.

392
00:50:56,490 --> 00:51:03,450
That isn't right, you shouldn't be doing that, that is wrong, that person is too weak,

393
00:51:03,550 --> 00:51:05,520
you are taking advantage of them.

394
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:10,360
Never mind how much I can describe Causticum.

395
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:16,030
Whether we give Causticum or not it doesn't matter,

396
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:23,690
this is what I'm trying to describe in the lecture. The government, down the government,

397
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:28,790
I'm an extremist, throw a bomb, finish with them.

398
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:51,120
-Would you physically almost want to attack the person?

399
00:51:51,220 --> 00:52:00,770
-Almost, I don't physically attack people but I'm very irritable.

400
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:07,860
-I see that you had an incident where you most probably you became...

401
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:16,860
-This time if I saw somebody hitting a woman, a man hitting a woman,

402
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:26,620
I will physically intervene or a child, very upsetting.

403
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:39,040
Here what you see is the sympathetic element because he is Phosphorus

404
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:42,440
but there is another element which is much harder here.

405
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:51,050
Do you see the hardness? If you hit somebody who is weak, now I'm going to kill you.

406
00:52:51,150 --> 00:53:00,460
This is the attitude of Causticum. Phosphorus will try to love both.

407
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:06,460
It's different, most soft attitude, most soft approach though he is suffering.

408
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:34,940
-Did you read religious books when you were young or was just the religious feelings?

409
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:45,140
-I would go to church a lot, sitting in front of the statues and I would go to communion every day.

410
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:52,520
-You felt relieved by that? What you felt? Why you did it so frequently?

411
00:53:52,620 --> 00:54:02,880
-I felt that that was what I had to do. I didn't feel that this makes me feel good.

412
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:07,360
-Tell me about your family? How you lived?

413
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:14,030
-My father was very mentally unstable, a lot of depression,

414
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:21,520
he was in a mental hospital several times, very physically abusive of all of the children,

415
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:25,770
never my mother. She said she would kill him in his sleep.

416
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:29,610
He never was abusive to her but he was very abusive of us physically.

417
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:31,780
-He hit you?
-Yes.

418
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:39,940
Kicked us , punched us and I was so afraid of him. I didn't speak until I was 3 years old

419
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,790
and they thought I was dumb.

420
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:54,620
-He didn't speak till he was 3 and they thought he was dumb.

421
00:54:56,630 --> 00:55:07,620
Why? Because he got great fright from his father. What is this?

422
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:23,710
Does a Causticum stop talking or he talks?
-Talks.

423
00:55:24,870 --> 00:55:32,530
-He talks rather than keep his mouth shut, difficult to suppress the Causticum.

424
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:37,120
The Causticum also can be suppressed and then he goes into stuttering.

425
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:46,200
Which is the remedy which is suppressed?
-Staphysagria.

426
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:54,020
-We see signs of Staphysagria from the very early age.

427
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:01,790
Let's see a little bit more.

428
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:13,600
-I was so afraid of him. I didn't speak till I was 3 years old. They took me to a doctor,

429
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:17,270
he did all the tests and he said, there is nothing wrong with this boy.

430
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:23,760
The doctor said do you have a husband who is very angry man? He said he is afraid of him.

431
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:33,090
He won't talk because he is afraid of getting trouble. Then I was very dreadful at his presence.

432
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:35,010
-Do you remember this consultation yourself?

433
00:56:35,110 --> 00:56:42,610
-No, my mother told me and I wet the bed until I was 13.

434
00:56:44,190 --> 00:56:48,430
During one period for months and months I can remember, he would come in,

435
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:56,680
feel the bed if it was wet, he would pull me out of bed, bit me, throw me back in the bed, curse me,

436
00:56:56,780 --> 00:57:05,770
bit me and always when I was wetting the bed, I had a dream of falling.

437
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:14,630
And every time I was falling, I was wetting the bed, it happened every night.

438
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:27,390
That was till about age 13, then at age 14 I started getting this tenderness in the abdomen.

439
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:31,950
-Do you have other brothers, sisters?

440
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:37,950
-An older brother and two sisters and a younger brother.

441
00:57:38,050 --> 00:57:41,870
-The others are suffering with any serious disease?

442
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:50,790
-My sister next to me had ulcerative colitis, when she was 20, my other sister has psoriasis

443
00:57:50,890 --> 00:57:56,100
and my older brother has very sensitive abdomen.

444
00:57:57,470 --> 00:58:08,280
-Your mother had any problems with intestines, digestive track, duodenal ulcer?

445
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:19,890
-I don't think so but her brother was operated recently. She thinks it is Chron's disease.

446
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:25,110
-Her brother who is how old? 60?
-About 60.

447
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:38,110
-Your father you said he was in a mental hospital?
-2-3 times.

448
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:41,490
-What was the diagnosis?

449
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:44,990
-I never learned what the diagnosis was but to me it seemed like a paranoiac

450
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:50,530
schizophrenia. He sees people, watching him all the time. Do you see that person?

451
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:55,620
He is watching me. Ever since I was young, he is watching me

452
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:58,250
and I had a lot of conflict with my father.

453
00:58:58,350 --> 00:59:02,740
About age 15 I never talked to him anymore.

454
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:06,950
I'd been in the same room and never talk to him, as if he didn't exist.

455
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:13,040
Till about age 19. I would talk to my mother.

456
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:18,130
-You had very strong feelings against him.
-Very strong.

457
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:32,050
Can anybody give me the indication, what took place in him? In his organism?

458
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:41,870
At the age of 13 he started having the tenderness and he did not speak to his father

459
00:59:41,970 --> 00:59:47,300
from the age of 13 and for 5 years.

460
00:59:54,780 --> 01:00:10,090
He is living in the house but he rebels now. He has been hit, beaten by his father,

461
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:23,100
he was really badly molested and only when he is 13 he stops speaks to him and the pain appears.

462
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:26,020
What it means?

463
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:31,760
-Suppressed anger, it went into the liver.

464
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:37,050
-Yes but from another point of view, from the remedy point of view,

465
01:00:37,150 --> 01:00:48,340
how could we explain the transition? We see a picture of Staphysagria in the beginning

466
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:56,360
and then he rebels.

467
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:04,780
The picture Staphysagria subsides and the Causticum picture starts to come up.

468
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:12,020
Why in our books we say Causticum and Staphysagria are complementaries?

469
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:20,860
That means you give the one and the action of the other is complementing the cure.

470
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:25,840
They are complementary remedies, they complement the cure.

471
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:30,040
We call it complement each other, that is the wrong expression.

472
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:37,200
What we mean is that they complete the cure. This is the idea.

473
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:42,590
You give one remedy, brings the organism up to a certain extend and then another remedy

474
01:01:42,690 --> 01:01:48,840
which completes the cure. That is the idea.

475
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:54,270
With this boy we see a Staphysagria picture, underlined the trembling from 3 years old,

476
01:01:54,370 --> 01:02:01,170
he can not even open his mouth and talk because he is terrified.

477
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:09,260
Inside this boy's mind is how can I get out of that situation? How can I get out?

478
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:16,850
And then eventually there is a battle on his organism and the organism finds a way

479
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:19,930
on the mental level to find a solution.

480
01:02:20,030 --> 01:02:26,680
Once this mental level is not confused anymore and it is clear, I'm going not to speak

481
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:31,000
again to my father and it's clear, it takes the decision, then the disease

482
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:41,280
is going to another level and it is somatised, going to another remedy.

483
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:46,440
Which remedy? The rebel remedy now.

484
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:53,010
How is it possible that we have complementary action between Staphysagria and Causticum.

485
01:02:53,110 --> 01:03:04,860
That is how it is possible. Many times I have explained in lectures this story,

486
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:07,050
now we see that story.

487
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:12,210
Staphysagria picture turning into Causticum picture.

488
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:19,130
Now we are almost sure. Let us see a little bit more.

489
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:29,920
-Anger, a lot of anger.
-Yes.

490
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:56,780
-Today I'm quite irritable, I find I'm quite irritable. My wife and daughter don't take any notice.

491
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:01,070
I just say why the hell you put a knife in my bag, you gonna cut your hands if you reach

492
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:04,220
that knife. My wife goes...

493
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:12,740
I tell my daughter, clean your room up. She blows at me, they don't take me seriously.

494
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:23,090
I know that they don't. And I say to my daughter I'm so irritable, no, no you are not irritable.

495
01:04:29,330 --> 01:04:35,070
Fear of criticism, I have it quite strongly.

496
01:04:35,170 --> 01:04:39,650
If I'm criticized it feels like if I have an ulcer inside my emotional body

497
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:41,830
and somebody stuck his finger.

498
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:47,750
What is he describing?

499
01:04:54,250 --> 01:05:12,180
Causticum, we have a grand symptom, keynote which says pain feels like raw, the skin is out

500
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:18,840
and then you are touching a wound and that is how the pains of Causticum are felt.

501
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:28,000
Now what is he saying? On the emotional body I have an ulcer which somebody is touching,

502
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:35,490
it's raw, he doesn't mention the word raw but it is as if raw.

503
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:42,690
This is exactly the description on an emotional level. It is painful and somebody is touching,

504
01:05:42,790 --> 01:05:44,920
it is an open wound.

505
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:50,830
It feels like an open wound, I can't touch it, it says the Causticum.

506
01:05:55,420 --> 01:06:00,510
I told him the whole class is going to find the remedy. You will hear that now.

507
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:14,750
-An ulcer inside my emotional body and somebody is stuck his finger on it. It hurts.

508
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:23,830
If I do something emotionally stupid, it hurts. I don't like to do that.

509
01:06:24,950 --> 01:06:33,320
-And the pain, this tenderness what kind of pain?

510
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:41,070
-It is a clumping pain, twisting my stomach and when it is really bad,

511
01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:47,820
it feels like my intestines are all stuck together and if I move, even if I don't move,

512
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:50,510
it feels like being ripped apart.

513
01:06:54,420 --> 01:07:03,240
-Now you have described the physical state, you have frequent stools that you can not retain.

514
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:08,820
-That's right, I get these collics before the stools and I rush to the toilet,

515
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:15,170
this colic goes away but I always have discomfort in my abdomen.

516
01:07:16,050 --> 01:07:19,240
-Before the stool you have a pain and as soon as you have the stool, the pain goes away.

517
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:25,670
-It goes away. The cramping pain but I've always, there is always pain down here.

518
01:07:27,430 --> 01:07:29,990
-How many stools the day you may have?

519
01:07:30,090 --> 01:07:35,740
-At least 20. I took account before I left Canada but that's good.

520
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:37,750
-That's the best.

521
01:07:37,850 --> 01:07:46,840
-Yes, sometimes it can be up to 40 and I don't know what causes it. It is just water.

522
01:07:49,010 --> 01:07:53,240
-Does it come out with a lot of gas?

523
01:07:53,340 --> 01:08:03,080
-No, I just sit down and psss... a little bit and then 5 min. later back I go again

524
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:08,070
and a little bit and 5 min. later back I have to go again.

525
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:10,750
-If you retain it, you may lose it.

526
01:08:10,850 --> 01:08:18,490
-I can't retain it, it is not physically possible. I have to keep paper in my underwear

527
01:08:18,590 --> 01:08:24,510
and I have to hold my hand on my anus. I can't control my anus.

528
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:43,490
-What kind of diet do you follow? Do you follow a diet?

529
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:52,260
-I don't eat high fibers food because it makes stools.

530
01:08:57,850 --> 01:09:07,160
So I try to eat massy foods, my food desires very strong, salt, 4 underlines,

531
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:14,570
I salt everything before I eat it. Potatoes, my wife said when I'm in Greece

532
01:09:14,670 --> 01:09:20,090
they want one potato because I eat potatoes every day.

533
01:09:21,310 --> 01:09:28,490
Season foods, I cant' stand blald foods, just can't stand them. It has to be season.

534
01:09:28,590 --> 01:09:35,510
Milk, I love milk but I can't drink because if I drink it my anus is even worse.

535
01:09:36,220 --> 01:09:44,660
Cold water, icy water, I don't like room temperature, it's terrible, I won't drink it

536
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:51,180
and I drink about 3-4 lit the day of water or juice.

537
01:09:55,180 --> 01:10:06,600
Why do I ask? I ask about desires and aversions because the Causticum picture is very strong

538
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:14,930
and therefore I expect to find in the Causticum picture desire for salt,

539
01:10:15,030 --> 01:10:19,950
aversion to sweets, to confirm.

540
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:27,430
Causticum does not like sweets, usually in 98% of the cases do not like sweets

541
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:56,300
and of course Causticum likes smoked things but here we have very strong thirst for cold.

542
01:10:59,710 --> 01:11:05,050
Have we been mistaking a Phosphorus for Causticum?

543
01:11:17,710 --> 01:11:33,450
If the symptom thirst for cold water was a symptom without a reason,

544
01:11:33,550 --> 01:11:36,150
we would have to think twice.

545
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:57,200
We have loss of fluids very much, 20 stools have to be replaced and it is water,

546
01:11:57,300 --> 01:12:01,950
water which comes out, a lot of water has to be replaced.

547
01:12:02,050 --> 01:12:10,550
Still it's important but not so important as to overturn all our prescription.

548
01:12:11,330 --> 01:12:16,120
That is how one is mislead to Phosphorus.

549
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:23,710
Thirsty, desire salt, thirsty for cold water, Phosphorus.

550
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:37,300
Steals ice cream yes? Why not? That is Phosphorus.

551
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:44,620
But we say in our teaching that Phosphorus and Causticum are inimical remedies, why?

552
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:51,220
Because they look alike. Is that what everybody knows?

553
01:12:56,130 --> 01:13:10,970
You see how close the sympathetic element, the thirst, the salt?

554
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:20,050
-Highly seasoned.

555
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:33,900
-That's why it is important to know the essences, what we call the essence.

556
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,050
They say Vithoulkas is speaking about the essences, he talks about his own phantasies.

557
01:13:38,150 --> 01:13:43,450
These are the phantasies, if you don't have the phantasies, you have the results.

558
01:13:43,550 --> 01:13:46,880
You chose either the phantasies or the results.

559
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:58,530
And when this man will be better, we'll say oh yes he reached an age now

560
01:13:58,630 --> 01:14:02,800
where he had to be better. I know this also.

561
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:14,190
And Colocynthis may come into the picture eventually because again it falls

562
01:14:14,290 --> 01:14:20,280
into the picture of Causticum, Staphysagria, Colocynthins.

563
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:26,900
It is a kind of circle that these three remedies they follow each other.

564
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:48,300
We thought of Medorrhinum, he said oranges? He didn't say that.

565
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:06,950
We have the possibility of Medorrhinum also because he shows some elements of Medorrhinum

566
01:15:07,050 --> 01:15:13,950
and later on he will say that at a specific period in his life,

567
01:15:14,050 --> 01:15:20,800
he used to eat 15 oranges the day. You will hear it now.

568
01:15:23,550 --> 01:15:25,690
-What about Veratrum?

569
01:15:25,790 --> 01:15:37,900
-Veratrum, that's why probably he was given Veratrum with the same thinking without an effect.

570
01:15:58,630 --> 01:16:05,440
-Aversions, I'm aversed to coffee, never drink coffee, I just can't stand the taste of coffee,

571
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:09,790
I'm aversed to alcohol, beer, whisky, liqueur, wine.

572
01:16:09,890 --> 01:16:22,190
I cant' stand the taste, it's too bitter for me. I can't drink it. I like fat, not a lot.

573
01:16:22,290 --> 01:16:27,790
I was vegetarian for a long time and then I just got fed up with everything and I decided

574
01:16:27,890 --> 01:16:37,540
that I will eat meat and I eat it. I'm going back more or less being a vegetarian

575
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:40,150
because I found I don't like meat very much.

576
01:16:42,250 --> 01:16:50,800
And after I have this severe flare up, I always get craving for fish, oysters.

577
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:57,210
I get two tins of oysters and just eat them. Smoked oysters, just there.

578
01:17:01,010 --> 01:17:07,550
-It's very interesting, you hear desire for fish is Phosphorus.

579
01:17:07,650 --> 01:17:16,810
Oysters, Phosphorus has an aversion to oysters but then he continues smoked...

580
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:42,210
-Smoked oysters and salted herrings. I will eat tin after tin, salted herrings, fish,

581
01:17:42,310 --> 01:17:49,130
I will crave fish very much, smoked fish. My wife is saying it's fish time,

582
01:17:49,230 --> 01:17:51,480
now you are getting better.

583
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:54,880
-As soon as you feel better, you go to fish?

584
01:17:54,980 --> 01:17:59,960
-When the pain is very intense I couldn't eat anything because it would make it much

585
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:05,380
worse and I would have 4 days of intense pain where I would be just riving around.

586
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:12,300
I can't do anything, I can't sleep, just very irritable, exceedingly  irritable

587
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:16,730
and then it goes down by 40% in intensity.

588
01:18:19,150 --> 01:18:29,380
Then irritability becomes a kind of weepy. This is always happening to me.

589
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:32,400
My wife says you sound like a Pulsatilla.

590
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:44,250
And I get weepy and then I go to a depressive state and then I start craving fish,

591
01:18:44,350 --> 01:18:46,600
that's the fish time.

592
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:54,980
-What about sweets?
-Not so much.

593
01:18:56,170 --> 01:18:58,050
-What about cheese?

594
01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:09,660
You see I don't want to hear desire sweets, so I let him talk, talk

595
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:13,740
and say what happened with the sweets, he didn't even mention desire of aversion.

596
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:18,650
I'm curious, I want to know that's why I put a straight question

597
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:22,910
because it's another confirmatory symptom for Causticum again.

598
01:19:23,010 --> 01:19:26,090
Strong aversion for sweets the Causticum.

599
01:19:27,010 --> 01:19:33,800
So he gives not an aversion really but still he doesn't like very much.

600
01:19:50,950 --> 01:19:58,090
-Strong cheese, I like strong cheese and ice-cream a lot, strawberry ice-cream.

601
01:20:01,180 --> 01:20:02,770
But I can't eat very much.

602
01:20:02,870 --> 01:20:06,400
-Do you eat ice cubes?

603
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:13,500
-I would suck ice cubes, it makes my mouth cool.

604
01:20:14,790 --> 01:20:17,760
We have the possibility of Medorrhinum.

605
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:31,830
-When I was up to about age 24-25, I would eat 15 oranges at one time.

606
01:20:35,670 --> 01:20:42,920
-What age?
-From being a child up to age 25.

607
01:20:47,590 --> 01:20:52,670
-I want to ask a question. Did you ever have gonorrhea?

608
01:20:52,970 --> 01:20:56,880
-Not that I know.

609
01:20:56,980 --> 01:21:00,960
-You would know if you had it.

610
01:21:01,060 --> 01:21:02,330
-The sexual thoughts stopped?

611
01:21:02,430 --> 01:21:06,130
-The sexual thoughts stopped at 25 why? Can anybody tell me?

612
01:21:07,730 --> 01:21:10,720
-It's the oranges.

613
01:21:28,230 --> 01:21:29,710
-No it's not the oranges, it's very simple.

614
01:21:29,810 --> 01:21:33,990
I have not discussed with him and he can say yes or no.

615
01:21:34,990 --> 01:21:37,640
-He got married.

616
01:21:37,740 --> 01:21:45,550
-No, the sexual thoughts in Staphysagria and other remedies they come

617
01:21:45,650 --> 01:21:52,490
when there is not satisfaction, actual satisfaction.

618
01:21:53,820 --> 01:22:01,890
If the real physical satisfaction is not there, then we have sexual phantasies

619
01:22:01,990 --> 01:22:05,240
and this also leads to masturbation.

620
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:13,410
Once sexual function starts being satisfying, the thoughts vanish.

621
01:22:14,250 --> 01:22:26,910
So it is the time when sexually he is satisfied, he does not need a substitute.

622
01:22:30,330 --> 01:22:33,560
What do you think about?
-Right.

623
01:22:33,660 --> 01:22:41,630
-He said it's right. Did we speak about this before? It's obvious.

624
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:49,800
Why I forgot to ask about whether he had gonorrhea?

625
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:55,740
Because I saw through questioning that there is no Medorrhinum.

626
01:22:56,660 --> 01:22:58,870
So it went out of my mind even to ask.

627
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:18,300
His state of health together with his brother, sisters is not a very good state of health.

628
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:30,470
His father is very sick, mentally quite disturbed but his mother saves the situation.

629
01:23:30,570 --> 01:23:36,230
The mixture of the two and they do not go towards mental derangement the children.

630
01:23:36,330 --> 01:23:45,140
If the mother was also with a severe chronic disease, the children would have gone

631
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:51,990
on the mental problems.

632
01:23:53,650 --> 01:23:56,580
So the mother saves the situation here.

633
01:23:58,670 --> 01:24:04,180
We didn't discuss about that also about his mother but I would consider his mother quite sane,

634
01:24:04,970 --> 01:24:07,090
quite down to earth.

635
01:24:08,450 --> 01:24:17,820
In order to have this kind of results, colitis, where the disease is able to somatise

636
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:27,260
his mother must have been down to earth woman, strong woman with strong mental-emotional body.

637
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:38,090
-She is very strong, she lives with me.

638
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:46,000
-Let us see.

639
01:24:46,950 --> 01:24:57,160
-Up to about age 25 I will just eat oranges all the time.

640
01:25:02,510 --> 01:25:07,760
This is a hint for Medorrhinum, we have to explore the possibility.

641
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:26,020
-For amusement when I was young I was very bright, at school I got very high marks,

642
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:30,190
I  used to read an encyclopedia and I would come home and take the encyclopedia

643
01:25:30,290 --> 01:25:38,360
and sit for hours reading, just all that knowledge interested me so much.

644
01:25:42,450 --> 01:25:46,350
-Do you have a time where you always feel better or worse?

645
01:25:46,450 --> 01:25:50,930
When you wake up in the morning or the afternoon?

646
01:25:51,030 --> 01:25:58,940
-Not a time. If I do physical activity, if I move all the chairs in this room,

647
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:04,430
I would be suck for two weeks, I would not be able to get to the lectures.

648
01:26:04,530 --> 01:26:09,120
-Worse from physical activity?
-Much worse in energy level.

649
01:26:12,450 --> 01:26:18,010
You see the question was for Medorrhinum. If he was Medorrhinum,

650
01:26:18,110 --> 01:26:22,690
he would give straight amelioration in the evening.

651
01:26:25,370 --> 01:26:33,850
After sunset I feel better and all that. Then we have to restructure all of our thinking

652
01:26:33,950 --> 01:26:39,850
and go further to see what is aggravation, amelioration from the sea etc.

653
01:26:39,950 --> 01:26:42,040
Let's see.

654
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:47,770
-How you react to climate?

655
01:26:47,870 --> 01:26:52,560
-I hate the cold, I'm very chilly, I catch colds very easily.

656
01:26:52,660 --> 01:26:58,800
If I go to sleep in a draft for sure I wake up with a sore throat, then I get a cold,

657
01:26:58,900 --> 01:27:04,050
then it's on my chest. I don't like the damp.

658
01:27:04,150 --> 01:27:06,780
When I was in England I hated the damp weather.

659
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:21,600
-This is not a good keynote for Causticum. It is the opposite.

660
01:27:21,700 --> 01:27:29,210
Causticum likes damp weather. Let's see.

661
01:27:37,370 --> 01:27:46,110
-But I also don't like being in a sun, I never sit in the sun but I like hot baths.

662
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:51,440
I never go to sea. We were in Greece for six weeks, I went swimming once.

663
01:27:51,540 --> 01:27:52,840
I can't stand going swimming.

664
01:27:52,940 --> 01:27:56,680
-You can't stand going swimming.
-No, no.

665
01:27:56,780 --> 01:28:00,090
-In the sea in general you don't feel better?
-No.

666
01:28:00,190 --> 01:28:00,970
-Worse from the sea?
