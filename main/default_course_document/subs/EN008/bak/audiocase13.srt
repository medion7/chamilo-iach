1
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,890
-What is the problem?

2
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,750
-I start with the physical.

3
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:52,980
Two months ago I started backache, I didnt have it before,

4
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,230
in the low part of the back and

5
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:06,660
it was always in the morning.

6
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:15,950
When I wake up and walk 2-3 steps, it goes away. Suddenly it comes with pain,

7
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:31,350
it came 14 days after and when I get up in the morning and walk, it goes away.

8
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:43,900
I feel its something wrong in my life now. I lose my energy when Im not working.

9
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,860
I sit there and something is away, I have to lie down and sleep.

10
00:01:52,960 --> 00:02:03,300
I try some healing now and that makes me total caput.

11
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:16,800
I know there is something wrong with my spleen because my tongue is too brown now.

12
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,630
From too much drinking.

13
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:33,020
-Do you eat a lot of drinks? Any type?

14
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,520
-Yes any type?

15
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,020
-You drink tea and coffee?

16
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:56,850
-Not coffee, not coca-cola. I drink beer and water mostly and wine.

17
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:03,110
-So tomorrow you have here last chance.

18
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:07,360
-The wine here is not doing me well.

19
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:19,100
I have a reaction by that. My colon stuck with constipation and at the same time

20
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,590
depressed. It comes together.

21
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:33,450
It comes and goes. I got diarrhea like yesterday and then energy comes up again and

22
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:37,350
always when Im coming to a new place like this,

23
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:43,170
I have constipation always the first 3-4 days and that is always the same

24
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,920
with my mother.

25
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,420
-Characteristic of your mother also?

26
00:03:48,520 --> 00:04:04,080
-Yes. When I was about 6 years old I got asthma that lasted for 3-4 years,

27
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:13,930
then it was got away without treatment.

28
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:22,150
I know in my life there was when I was one year old my mother tried always to take me

29
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:27,570
from the breast and every time I got a cold.

30
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:34,520
When I come to the breast it was OK. There is a part in me that I want to go back in that

31
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:46,010
breast again. There is something regretting inside me. I want something with love, safe

32
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:51,040
-Affection and security.

33
00:04:51,140 --> 00:05:02,000
-Yes, I was in India and I met a man whom was clairvoyant and I was talking to him and

34
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:08,220
suddenly lied down on the floor and cries to me mother, mother!

35
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,460
He has seen that part of me.

36
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,700
-Who lied down?

37
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,480
-Him, I asked him something... Let me lie down and say mother, mother in a way that it

38
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:30,680
really came to me. I feel there is something with my mother.

39
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:42,960
Im divorced. Now I live together with a girl. I have a child who is two years old and in one

40
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:48,330
year she got asthma, a real heavy asthma.

41
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:56,540
We cured the asthma with Nat sulphuricum but not the mucus, so when gets a cold, it

42
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,830
takes about 2-3 days when the asthma comes. Then the Nat sulphuricum,

43
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:09,380
the asthma goes away but still she is with mucus.

44
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:15,620
-This girl you have it with your second wife?

45
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:23,610
-Yes. My two first children are very healthy

46
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:34,580
Im very afraid to start with a new remedy after new remedy and then end up after 50

47
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,060
remediesbecause Ive tried only 5 in my life.

48
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,780
-What did you try?

49
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:47,740
-I tried Medorrhinum, I had gonorrhea two times and

50
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:55,060
that was when I was brought in Thailand and I got a sycotic strong

51
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,810
I was sitting in the room in China, I had to run and talk with people,

52
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:08,810
the first time in my life and there was something itching in my penis.

53
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:14,030
Both of these gonorrhea was treated

54
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:18,530
-With penicillin?
-Yes.

55
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:22,260
-You got it after the gonorrhea was treated?

56
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:32,230
-It was years after. Gonorrhea I got in 1979 and this was in 1981.

57
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:37,390
I got Medorrhinum for that. It took about 7 days when I got that reaction.

58
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,680
-Did you have a discharge from the urethra?

59
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:49,150
-No, only a little mucus and then I had tried Medorrhinum afterwards and no reaction but

60
00:07:49,250 --> 00:08:03,590
then I got Sulphur and I got a little bit change, then it goes a little up but then its not coming.

61
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:18,500
I feel Im going towards disease now. I feel it really.

62
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,590
-Can you show your tongue?

63
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:37,290
There is yellowness in base and white.

64
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:59,040
There are marks from the teeth.

65
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:12,400
You got Medorrhinum first. Did you have a good reaction?

66
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,910
-It was this reaction, nothing else.

67
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:23,900
-You didnt feel any better in your health? More energy?

68
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:32,350
-Nothing. Then I took Sulphur and then I got diarrhea.

69
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:35,140
-You got diarrhea from the first time?

70
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,170
-Yes.

71
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:40,390
-With the diarrhea you felt better?

72
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:56,360
-Yes, a little better and Ive tried so far 10M and 50M without reaction.

73
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:04,160
It was one year ago and I wake up one night about 3-4 with pain and I cant find a

74
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:11,610
situation to lie. Then I took Nux vomica and it went away.

75
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,360
-In the thoracic area?

76
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,650
-Yes.

77
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:30,280
-The thoracic area is the area of Sulphur, pain on the thoracic region is characteristic of

78
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:35,040
Sulphur very much.

79
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,600
So you took Nux vomica what potency?

80
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,020
-1M.

81
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:13,700
I tried Tuberculinum because my grandfather died when my father was 3 years from

82
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:31,090
tuberculosis and I had no reaction in vaccination. That was strange. And no reaction from Tuberculinum.

83
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:39,680
-Now you have diarrhea?

84
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:50,660
-Yesterday. The pain was from here down the back a little upwards but today when I got

85
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,400
constipation it was down.

86
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,930
-Sacral region?

87
00:11:55,030 --> 00:12:01,360
-Sacral region and I feel something in my achilles tendon.

88
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:09,110
-The symptom as it is said in the beginning pain in the lower back, worse in the morning,

89
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:18,190
better on walking, pain in the achilles again worse in the morning, better in walking

90
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:21,480
What is the remedy?

91
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,960
-Rhus tox.

92
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:39,690
-Rhus tox and its not only Rhus tox. The first remedy that he needs is Rhus tox.

93
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:43,700
We have sudden weakness.

94
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:50,830
-Sudden weakness complete and no energy.

95
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:54,060
-Especially when you are not busy?

96
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:00,720
-No, when I work in the clinic I can start 8 oclock and continue till 6 oclock in the

97
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:07,940
afternoon but I have 3 days free in the week and then

98
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,940
-You are exhausted.

99
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:23,610
-Yes but its better towards the evening, about 2-3 oclock...

100
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,240
-At 8-9 oclock better?

101
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:44,190
-Better then but its a general feeling of something stuck in there, something not moving

102
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:50,240
and sadness is coming, the constipation is coming, I dont have energy to train again, not

103
00:13:50,340 --> 00:14:01,960
doing meditation or yoga, my relationship with the girl is not stimulated.

104
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:10,880
I know that I should change my diet. I always

105
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:21,070
I took something from [name] that is a clairvoyant person in Denmark and

106
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:33,330
I took something in Norway and I know its coming but I dont have the energy.

107
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,820
-You dont have the energy to take the decision.

108
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:51,980
-Yes... Its quite hard. I need too much energy for that but Im grown in that areas,

109
00:14:52,080 --> 00:15:03,960
 so I feel I can take it, I need it but it takes a lot of energy.

110
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:27,120
I never get a cold. I havent been sick for 10-15 years not a single cold, very good health.

111
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,670
 And suddenly this situation comes.

112
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,920
I smoke for 3 years now.

113
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:38,730
-How old are you?
-39.

114
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:45,460
-Do you drink a lot of beer now?
-Yes.

115
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:56,890
-Are you aware that there is yellowness the conjunctiva?

116
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:03,610
-I have some pressure and I was sitting with a patient,

117
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:23,270
 I was involved emotionally and something like

118
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:27,730
-Like a spasm?
-Yes.

119
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:32,490
-Have you examined for that?

120
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:38,710
-No X-rays, nothing.

121
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:48,900
-When you go to the diarrhea, you have normal stool and when the diarrhea started?

122
00:16:49,000 --> 00:17:04,910
-I was on Saturday, Sunday constipated, Monday constipated and yesterday diarrhea came

123
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:05,390


124
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:06,640
-Before that?

125
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,880
-I was constipated.

126
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,720
-In Norway?

127
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:25,180
-The tendency is constipated and then I take some laxative, some natural and I feel better

128
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:34,150
but it is unstable. Im going back to a little depressed, the colon stuck again.

129
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:46,600
My mother had that problem always, she is 60. My father never.

130
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:55,220
It is something happened, I think I was 2 years old, and there was a horrible thing from my

131
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:09,720
father. I make stool on the street and then he took me here and put my nose in it and

132
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:17,730
suddenly I was finished with it, no more stool.

133
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:23,580
I always have a lot of trouble with stool, I remember sitting on the toilet pressing and

134
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:40,820
pressing, with pain quite young.

135
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:50,800
-How was your other life? It was without big problems?

136
00:18:50,900 --> 00:19:00,890
-It has been an easy life in one way. I studied Medicine in Germany, easy life but Im

137
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:04,230
divorced, that was hard time. Then I got angry.

138
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:09,730
When I get angry I dont get a distance.

139
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:20,660
Then I sit down with my ex- affair and takes and writes that I was an idiot and things like that.

140
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:25,860
When Im angry, I sit down and I write and I put it in a red box an envelope and send it to

141
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:30,600
her and then its coming back in

142
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:43,080
When I was to Boston I divorced, I found my ex-wife with another man and I got letters.

143
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:54,310
I live very much in my phantasy.

144
00:19:54,410 --> 00:20:03,370
When I was young I dreamed about struggling, it was always somebody following me and

145
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:24,580
there was a lot of nightmares. But since I was 10 I cant remember a dream.

146
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:30,550
Now I can have a dream that Im saving the world, its good dreams, half awake, half

147
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:43,540
asleep and Im doing good to humanity and things like that. But I dream very little now.

148
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,800
-Daydreaming?

149
00:20:45,900 --> 00:21:00,610
-Daydreaming yes, I jump into my phantasy, a lot of phantasy, not in the night, in the day.

150
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:05,330
-The phantasy is around what?

151
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:14,220
-Around to be with the right girl or to be in a safe place and to get a lot of love because I

152
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:24,690
cure patients. In one way Im weeping for love in this world and things like that in my

153
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:40,690
phantasy. Its not to be the best in Medicine, not that.

154
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:47,910
-When did you divorce first time?

155
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:58,930
-It was in 1979. For a period before we separated, we stayed together.

156
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:12,910
When we came to the divorce it wasnt planned. In our relation, it was more struggling or

157
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:22,620
fighting but that consequence I wasnt prepare for that.

158
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,620
-Did you overcome this?

159
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:41,840
-I went into Nux vomica state, I buy new things and I change my job and I train and run

160
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:48,570
All the spiritual side of my life to help.

161
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:52,290
-When did you meet the other girl that you are now with?

162
00:22:52,390 --> 00:23:03,700
-I met her when I was so lonely after I got divorced. I worked as a psychiatrist and I

163
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:12,940
started a relation to get my loneliness away.

164
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:19,660
-And you got involved?

165
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:32,100
-I tried.

166
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,970
-Do you feel trapped in that situation now?

167
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:49,660
-I feel trapped, Im not getting that money and things away as long as these things I had to

168
00:23:49,760 --> 00:24:01,810
stay in the house because I cant tell my old address and I had to stay there.

169
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:11,970
I cant make my own house now for living. Of course I love my third child.

170
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:20,690
The first two I see them some times the year and that is a tragedy.

171
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:40,980
2-3 days in the week, I play, that is the only thing.

172
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:58,770
-When did you start drinking?

173
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:14,940
-The last 2-3 years I feel I must relax in a way. After 8 hours to the clinic I go to some

174
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:27,450
place and take one beer and its OK. But Im never drunk. Its coming to my life to relax.

175
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:53,740
They told me that you must drink cold drinks and I continued and I easy get flatulence

176
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:12,870
now and if I drink much alcohol I get a horrible smell, its the same with my father.

177
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:17,520
-Do you feel distended?

178
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:32,160
-I feel distended. I feel like 90 kilos when Im 78 or something like that.

179
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:40,290
-This distention is always there or sometimes it is more?

180
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:52,600
-If I put myself together and say I have to eat vegetarian but

181
00:26:52,700 --> 00:27:08,810
if I eat some beef then it grows but especially with alcohol,

182
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:22,800
I get a lot of flatulence and it smells horrible.

183
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:25,550
-Your sleep is good?

184
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:35,770
-My sleep is quite good. I got some energy and I wake up 4 oclock in the morning but

185
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:42,310
 it was for only 2-3 days.

186
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:52,070
I got Hyoscyamus then I took Medorrhinum again, that was with an interval of one week and

187
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,910
then everything was gone.

188
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:06,250
-When you sleep you have salivation?

189
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:17,930
-No, its more dry. I smoke 15 cigarettes the day.

190
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:24,620
-Do you have great thirst? You are a thirsty person?

191
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:31,810
-No, I dont have thirst at all.

192
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:38,450
I dont eat breakfast and Im not drinking, then I can work until 6 in the afternoon without

193
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:44,430
drinking, without eating. Then I feel some thirst and thats natural but

194
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:48,980
its not the thirst, its a general thing.

195
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,450
-How you sleep, in what position?

196
00:28:52,550 --> 00:29:07,690
-On the back, on the sides, on both sides, never on the stomach.

197
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:13,940
-What is your reaction to weather?

198
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:27,940
-Im grown up in front of the sea and I love the sea and now Im better by the sea but

199
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:35,180
when the weather is changing, I dont feel anything.

200
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:39,690
-When it is very warm like here?

201
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:47,190
-Lets say here 4 years ago it was marvelous to come here but now I feel more sensitive

202
00:29:47,290 --> 00:30:07,930
to the heat. I will sit more in the shadow than to go in the sun.

203
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:20,020
I must say that in 1980 I took Lycopodium CM because I did some research, they were

204
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:30,270
some students that say you look so old comparing your age and I had some flatulence at

205
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:43,340
that time and I took Lycopodium CM. I didnt know Homeopathy at that time how is working

206
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,750


207
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:49,440
-How is your sexual drive now?

208
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:55,830
-It is out, its nothing.

209
00:30:55,930 --> 00:31:06,280
I never had very strong sexual drive. I have not the feeling. I can make sex every day and

210
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:17,710
no problem with potency but there is no feeling, it is flat. There is no fun, no enjoyment.

211
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:31,930
Ive always been a little reserved about that, especially when I was about 19 years old.

212
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:41,200
I was reserved, I was playing football

213
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:58,070
But if I get alcohol I can be extrovert but at the same time not extrovert.

214
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:27,120
-During sex do you have easy ejaculation?

215
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:30,410
-No.

216
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:42,880
-During sleep do you have night emissions?

217
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:50,990
-No, never.

218
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:58,980
-During sleep do you have night flowing?

219
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,320
-Never.

220
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:14,900
Its a same my sexual life, its a distance. I can have some closeness but I must have

221
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:25,880
some distance. And the girl I stay with, she is quite distant, thats good for me.

222
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:30,880
She doesnt bother me.

223
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:46,600
we talked about contact or intimacy and then I faint, that was too hot for me.

224
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:55,350
She did something like that and I fainted.

225
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:59,550
-What age?

226
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:21,230
-At the end of 20, about 1975. It was too strong.

227
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:24,210
-Can you urinate in front of others?

228
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:28,210
-Yes no problem.

229
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,200
-How much salt do you take?

230
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,410
-I dont like salt.

231
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:36,910
-Because of logical reasons or because the taste is not good?

232
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:40,100
-No, Ive never been for salt.

233
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:47,600
-What do you like?

234
00:34:47,700 --> 00:35:06,200
-I can eat a lot of tomato, green fruit, green apples

235
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:16,120
-Unripe, sour.

236
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:19,650
-Yes.

237
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,110
-Fish?

238
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:22,920
-No.

239
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,000
-You are a fisherman.

240
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:42,470
-Yes but I dont like it. It makes me heavy. I dont like the bones in the fish. All my life I

241
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:49,940
dont like.

242
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:55,410
-The fish that we caught the other time? Do you like?

243
00:35:55,510 --> 00:36:01,290
-That was small. But its not a desire for me.

244
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:04,070
-What about sweets?

245
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:16,270
-I can get periods, that means one day that I can buy chocolate but that makes me sick.

246
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:22,210
Then I can for half a year without.

247
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:25,430
-This half the year you have aversion?

248
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:35,390
-Not aversion but its not a desire. I can eat chocolate but I feel its something with my

249
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:36,850
energy

250
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:45,290
Then I can eat one day a lot of chocolate but it makes me at the same time sick.

251
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:55,000
Then I tend to be constipated and depressed.

252
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,760
-Did you take Nat mur?

253
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:00,590
-I never took.

254
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:26,180
I feel that my psychotherapy I have to provoke it.

255
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:41,220
To be in action, to sit there listening and analyzing thats no good.

256
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:59,370
If I work, I can go home 10 hours then its OK, then Im stimulated.

257
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:08,990
-This crisis of weakness is coming the last 3-4 years or it was all your life?

258
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:23,220
-No, the last 3-4 years but especially the last half year but I dont get anxiety about my

259
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:29,060
health, its more like I feel I have to put some will power.

260
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,480
-To do something for your health?

261
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:38,480
-Yes, I dont have the energy, I need something else to push me.

262
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:59,980
I cant take it in front of me and use it.

263
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:07,130
-What about your feet, are cold, warm?

264
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:10,880
-Very warm.

265
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:14,580
-You stick them out of covers?

266
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:23,600
-Yes and I put all my cover away. All my life I have soles with thick skin and

267
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:37,430
I got some heel cracks and I think it was 9 years ago that I took Antim-crudum and

268
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:49,910
these cracks went away.

269
00:39:50,010 --> 00:40:02,100
-Ive not decided yet. Different thoughts.

270
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:16,320
Do you feel that there is a big disappointment inside you?

271
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:23,550
-Its a disappointment.

272
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:29,660
-In which area? Or it is in all areas?

273
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,820
-No, when I work not. Im not disappointed.

274
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:39,210
-Can you say the disappointment is from the emotional life?

275
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:48,140
-From the emotional life Im disappointed, with my father-mother Im disappointed, there

276
00:40:48,240 --> 00:41:05,700
are people like bingo players, there is nothing in their life there is nothing there.

277
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:15,120
In a way I feel alone. If I come to a course, Acupuncture for example, and I feel that

278
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:19,870
something is suppressing me, not giving the right knowledge or something like that makes

279
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:24,180
me angry and sad.

280
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:30,880
There has been something in my life that I want to put my hand and be involved because

281
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:41,050
you dont feel usually that feeling. It has been there but there is no force, its not very

282
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:56,900
strong. It has been but its in my phantasy.

283
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:17,500
When I dance and flirt and things like that, then Im higher. But thats an ego trip at the

284
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:28,490
same time. That makes me very good. I like music.

285
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:42,460
-What kind of music?

286
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:56,720
-Elvis Presley or Beatles more romantic, I like that, not the heavy ones from Elvis but the

287
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:12,880
slow ones. Popular music I cannot stand that.I would say romantic.

288
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:16,590
-You can weep in music?

289
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:30,240
-Very difficult. I cant remember.

290
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:36,750
-To the school you have been good student or medium?

291
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:44,700
-I would say medium. I came to gymnasium because I jumped a class because of my

292
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:57,640
athletic part in it.

293
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:03,620
I learn very easily languages.

294
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:11,780
Then I went to Germany and studied Medicine and afterwards...

295
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:22,480
Very little force behind to come to the place I am now.

296
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:28,650
But the other things and I know my horoscope says that if I dont take [?] it will come a

297
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:39,130
disease, very much resistance.

298
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:47,100
-You said something about spiritual practices. When did you come in contact with some

299
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,840
spiritual person or guru?

300
00:44:49,940 --> 00:45:03,300
-In 1982 É went in Himalaya and then I met with Matthias Thomsen who has written a book

301
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:16,520
of life, he is very clearly speaking, I have been with Rudolf Steiner.

302
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:24,070
-Since when?

303
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:45,570
-Everything came after 1980. In 1979 I was in shock and then I went into that spiritual

304
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:49,580
-When you wake up in the morning you are refreshed?

305
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:57,000
-Not now.

306
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:24,640
-Did you have a lot of love affairs? Do you change easily or you prefer one?

307
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:44,490
-No, my first sexual experience was when I was 20. I had only 2 girls in my life.

308
00:46:44,590 --> 00:46:55,440
-The first one you were in love, you married her? Because you were in love with her or

309
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:57,920
you just got used to her?

310
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:07,130
-We met at the hospital, then we made sex and it was a guilty kind of sex, it was too easy.

311
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:14,850
It was more a moral question for me. Then I make a car accident and the wife from the

312
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:24,260
other car came in front of me and I broke my sternum and then I got this feeling

313
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:35,440
again of being alone and I wrote to her. She was older than me and no future plans

314
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:49,760
We came together again, she was a little hysteric, funny and then she got pregnant.

315
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:58,100
That was the second time.

316
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:27,480
I thought about that when I was asthmatic period must have been some

317
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:38,630
Im fastidious, I must take control of the right things in the right time but at the same time

318
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:43,260
it doesnt matter. There is polarity there.

319
00:48:43,360 --> 00:49:03,380
I feel a lot of Sulphur but at the same time Im not sure. Medorrhinum is not working.

320
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:18,560
-Is there any peculiarity that you have in your system? Fear? High places?

321
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:22,020
-Not fear.

322
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:26,840
-Are you afraid about death?

323
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:41,120
-I can have some but its not a strong fear. I would say from high places when I look down

324
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:47,500
its not such a good feeling but its not very strong.

325
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:52,150
-Did you feel any time when looking down that you want to jump?

326
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:54,230
-No.

327
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:07,930
-This relationship with your mother has suppressed you?

328
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:20,420
-The first remedy it was Sepia but she is always negative thinking, very suspicious and its

329
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:27,680
only the family and the people around are dangerous. My father is quite opposite.

330
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:33,660
He is extrovert and he wants to make speeches and I can think he is a Sulphur but

331
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:38,380
he does not stand contact.

332
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:47,220
 When he does something with his children or grandchildren he must do it with movements,

333
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:51,620
 to get some activity around, he never sits and tells stories.

334
00:50:51,720 --> 00:51:00,860
When there is this activity, then he can take it but never in a quiet position.

335
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,780
-You also want physical activity?

336
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:06,290
-Yes I like it.

337
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:07,280
-You feel better with that?

338
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:25,270
-I feel better with that. When I get some energy I start training.

339
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:29,810
-You give us problems.

340
00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:44,640
-I have tried only 5 remedies.

341
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:14,910
-OK. Lets hear more.

342
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:55,920
-Very difficult to take affection. He comes to a point where he cant take it. He is scared.

343
00:52:56,020 --> 00:53:05,780
-He cannot take affection.

344
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:18,010
-Its not easy for me to give things away.

345
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:31,000
I first give some gifts when someone is marrying and its terrible. I always avoid that.

346
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:34,490
-Why?

347
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:47,430
-Im not clear, I dont know. When I was 9 years old, I was sitting in my room and saying

348
00:53:47,530 --> 00:54:02,190
this is mine, this is mineIts coming from that period.

349
00:54:02,290 --> 00:54:05,650
-Do you have any problem in wearing a tie?

350
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:15,990
-I cant wear a tie, I cant wear it!

351
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:48,250
-Is anybody who wants to ask a question?

352
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:54,720
-Is he eating in the morning? Is he feeling better after eating.

353
00:54:54,820 --> 00:55:08,880
-Im not eating in the morning. I go to work at 6 oclock and Im not eating before I go to work

354
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:40,620
-Im satisfied with my life, my profession. The divorce

355
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:56,390
It is something to get close contact, to feel emotion, the affection and I chose two girls in

356
00:55:56,490 --> 00:56:09,880
my life and they are that way. So there is something missing there.

357
00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:25,070
-If you treat patients how do you feel then?

358
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:37,760
-It was difficult before but today I have trained myself not to take it. I feel good by that, I

359
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:45,560
can be a little tensed but I can take it and then I have to produce some negative thoughts,

360
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:53,080
some negative feelings, I can take it.

361
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:57,020
-If somebody gives you a gift?

362
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:13,480
-I feel that he wants to have more in one way, he wants the next step.

363
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:19,220
What is the next step? When the next step is coming, it makes me a little frozen,

364
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:21,210
unsecure.

365
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:28,840
-If they give you something, they wonna ask more?

366
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:44,020
-Im not trustful enough. Im a little suspicious, what is the next step, to lose my freedom?

367
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:51,730
-In your free days, if you start doing something then do you feel better?

368
00:57:51,830 --> 00:58:09,640
-Then its OK, when I sit down and nothing goes, its too little activity, then its terrible.

369
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:21,840
-Is it hard to get start?

370
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:26,710
-Yes the first step, I dont have the energy or the will power to take the first step. I know

371
00:58:26,810 --> 00:58:34,380
what to do, to stand up and make some meditation, some walk

372
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:43,530
But the first step? Its better to sit down with a beer and think that the world is going

373
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:51,490
against me, its easier.

374
00:58:51,590 --> 00:58:55,480
-What about your feelings? Do you have strong feelings inside?

375
00:58:55,580 --> 00:59:06,410
-No, its not strong. When I get in love, then its really strong.

376
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:15,360
But it must be a situation like that, mostly its flat, I dont have strong feelings.

377
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:26,010
Its something closed up here. Im very tense in this part.

378
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:39,140
-Emotional tension.

379
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:53,680
-About the bowel, do you ever have like any other day or is it constipated?

380
00:59:53,780 --> 01:00:03,580
-I cant remember that.

381
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:11,590
The tendency is to get constipation, then I can fix it up and I get to diarrhea but then its

382
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:13,230
back again.

383
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:22,520
-Do you like to talk or do you like to stay silent?

384
01:00:22,620 --> 01:01:00,360
-I like to talk, to be alone thats OK but if Im in a situation like its OK to talk a lot.

385
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:04,870
-...or its more a way to avoid?

386
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:15,660
-To avoid. If Im in affection or have stimulated then its OK.

387
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:36,100
If Im sitting alone, a day off, then its there and its complete nothing to go.

388
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:41,570
I had to work and bum like that with the same feeling.

389
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:43,330
-Sudden weakness?

390
01:01:43,430 --> 01:01:52,010
-Sudden weakness, I cant stand it.

391
01:01:52,110 --> 01:01:58,700
-Do you quarrel at all with your wife?

392
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:01,680
-Not as general tendency.

393
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:08,840
-Does she say words that can hurt you?

394
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:13,390
-She can say that.

395
01:02:13,490 --> 01:02:17,170
-You pay her back?

396
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:26,930
-If Im all right, I can pay back. She says Im lazy or things like that. Im a little lazy but

397
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:32,680
thats not so

398
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:43,190
Something which affects me and be angry, I can shout.

399
01:02:43,290 --> 01:02:50,650
Its heavy for me to take an affection or to take closeness or to take a gift but to be angry

400
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:54,040
thats OK.

401
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:58,280
-You can smash her?

402
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:14,680
-Yes I can be really angry.

403
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:58,290
-The homeopathic remedy gives a non clear picture concerning the remedy.

404
01:03:58,390 --> 01:04:05,560
Neither his pathology is clear cut.

405
01:04:05,660 --> 01:04:16,220
We suspect something is going on, I wont have in that stage any laborative test to show

406
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:23,880
some changes but definitely what he feels is right, something is going on with his health

407
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:30,360
which will end up into something.

408
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:50,210
Why this has happened? This is interesting in his case because it starts with a shock.

409
01:04:50,310 --> 01:05:02,960
And now he is in a crisis where he reevaluates values of life, consciously and

410
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:12,200
unconsciously he reevaluates and he finds out certain things about himself and about the

411
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:28,680
world that he does not like and that realization has immobilized his defenses, his reaction

412
01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:36,410
and will power.

413
01:05:36,510 --> 01:05:45,880
He is going through I would call it a spiritual crisis at the moment, trying to find out what is

414
01:05:45,980 --> 01:06:03,130
true and valuable, trying to sort out the truth As a result there is immobilization.

415
01:06:08,730 --> 01:06:16,880
Otherwise you would have enough power to take action.

416
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:27,970
He enjoys life in a way, he is successful but he is disappointed. That means he was

417
01:06:28,070 --> 01:06:35,480
thinking other things and other things happened.

418
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:50,680
This is the result of a grief or spiritual crisis and the question that we have would be

419
01:06:50,780 --> 01:07:01,630
whether we shall be treating this which comes about through the crisis or shall we go

420
01:07:01,730 --> 01:07:19,460
deeper and find out what is the constitutional-let us say- remedy?

421
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:29,430
Practically we are thinking of remedies that will come, which is Nat mur, Ignatia,

422
01:07:29,530 --> 01:07:49,770
Staphysagria that will treat the grief or remedies like Graphites, Mercury, Sulphur,

423
01:07:49,870 --> 01:07:52,860
which they seem to be deeper.
