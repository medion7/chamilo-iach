1
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,270
-What is the problem?

2
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:30,940
-I'm here now because I'm completely exhausted. Exhaustion is not because I'm pregnant,

3
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:38,450
I'm in 5th month now but it also was before already and it has got worse.

4
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:45,450
-During pregnancy?
 -Yes.

5
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:50,770
-Exhaustion is mental, emotional, physical, all three?

6
00:00:50,870 --> 00:01:01,220
-In the first 3,5 months I was so tired all three levels and since many, many years I have

7
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,690
strong tension here in the back of my neck and in my shoulders and I wake with

8
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,290
headaches almost every morning.

9
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:20,190
-This is a feeling of stiffness or real pain?

10
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:28,940
-It's as if the muscles contract, go into a spasm and it is so strong that it dislocates

11
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,450
the vertebrae.

12
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,350
-Why does she think this happens?

13
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:45,450
-The tension? Because I've been under a lot of tension for many years quite intense.

14
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:55,850
Just alone to ensure my existence, so to speak financially every month is an adventure

15
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,200
because I'm alone.

16
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,440
-She means the husband is not with her?

17
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:12,690
-No, I don't have a husband and my monthly payments which I due every month

18
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:18,290
are quite high, so just alone this factor already is a lot of stress.

19
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,540
I work every day, including Saturday and Sunday.

20
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:29,940
On the weekends I go to flea markets to make sure some income is coming to pay

21
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,210
for all the necessary expenses.

22
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:37,950
Besides that I have my practice and also other jobs.

23
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,870
-She works too much all these years.

24
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:58,270
-Yes but I have to. In my heart I have a feeling as if it is torn apart or if a knife

25
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:03,520
was in there. This happens every time my emotions come up, most of the time

26
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:08,520
I try to keep them down, to suppress them but if I can't manage and they come up,

27
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,870
this is the feeling, I have a strong pain in my heart.

28
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:19,020
-Strong pain emotional or real physical pain?

29
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,350
-I feel it physically but it's an emotional pain and it's coming from my soul.

30
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,640
There is a lot of sadness.

31
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:54,060
-Shit I intended so much not to cry.

32
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:07,810
The fact is since years I've been looking for a way out of this emotional load.

33
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:15,490
I have progressed during these years but still I didn't reach the point where

34
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:21,640
I can say now I have my full energy, now I can work, things are moving.

35
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,950
-What remedies she has taken so far?

36
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:33,700
-I started homeopathic treatment 3 years ago, I received Ignatia in 1M and this brought me

37
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,220
many suicidal thoughts and depression but no amelioration.

38
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:48,510
Then I received Carcinosin with hardly any effect, Baryta carb., Sepia and Nat. mur.

39
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,460
-No effect?
-Not much.

40
00:04:53,560 --> 00:05:01,390
The next homeopath again gave me Sepia and a colleague here in Alonissos gave me

41
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:05,240
Nat. Carbonicum 1,5 years ago.

42
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:11,390
I don't remember exactly the potency but it was quite high and the reaction to it

43
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,240
was that my ankles were swollen greatly.

44
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,140
-No amelioration?

45
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:25,470
-I got memory back to the time when I was 4 years old. It was a very clear memory.

46
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:31,470
I was at the beach close to the sea, a small child playing in the sun and there was a man

47
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:36,070
next to me who with his fingers was playing around me.

48
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,640
-She got back this memory?

49
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,300
-Yes, with Nat. carb. and so I asked this man what are you doing there with me?

50
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:52,180
And he said, you've got sand there and it has to be taken away, otherwise you get ill.

51
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:58,130
Today I think that's one of the most stupid answers you can give because if a child is dirty

52
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:02,130
all it has to do is go into the water and it's finished, there is no need to play

53
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:07,180
around with your fingers. So today I assume something must have been there.

54
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,630
I can't remember who it was. The good thing about it was that this memory came back without

55
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,760
injuring me, without hurting me.

56
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:20,480
It came up, it was like it was always have been there but it was no pain.

57
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:27,570
-Then after Nat. carb. you got another remedy?

58
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:31,570
-I then started a treatment and I received Nat. mur.

59
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:32,820
-Was an effect?

60
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:39,570
-I took the remedy briefly before I came to Alonissos, it was last year and you know

61
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,820
when I'm here I always feel better.

62
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:46,570
It has nothing to do with the sea because I can be in the sea side other times too.

63
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:50,070
It's really Alonissos, so maybe we will have to make an addition at the Repertory

64
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,100
Alonissos ameliorates.

65
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:59,240
When I came back to Germany this inner amelioration slowly faded it, then I had

66
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:05,160
a strong argument with my father and he made me so angry that I took the kitchen chair

67
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:09,510
and smashed it onto the ground, breaking it into pieces.

68
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,410
And after that I received Staphysagria. And after that I didn't break things anymore but

69
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:22,090
also I didn't feel any amelioration concerning this inner pressure I have.

70
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:30,440
In January I was cleaning up my desk in my practice and I found a paper bag that

71
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:37,410
I had contained the Nat. mur. 1M and without even thinking, as if I was unwrapping a chocolate,

72
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:43,990
I just opened the paper back and licked it and gave myself another dose of Nat. mur.

73
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:50,740
without really wanting it or knowing it and the effect was, after being single for 5 years

74
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,090
and not even having one night stand in between, I fell in love.

75
00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:04,570
I was so sure and so happy and love makes you blind and we were together, we had a good time

76
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:11,280
and I got pregnant. During this pregnancy my feelings started to fade also because I always was

77
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:16,080
so tired and exhausted and nauseous and things got less.

78
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:24,740
We separated 3 weeks ago, he went to Israel to work in a kibbutz and I don't know how

79
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,230
it's going to be when he comes back. He is going to be gone for half a year.

80
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,990
-This was happening in Israel?

81
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:38,040
-No, he is a German but he wanted to make the experience to be abroad and especially to be in Israel.

82
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,400
-So she was disappointed from that departure?

83
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:51,330
-Yes I was disappointed but I buried it all within myself.

84
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,740
And my situation in the pregnancy now is that I have to work because I have to earn money,

85
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,980
I'm getting no support from the father of the child, neither financially or physically in any way

86
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,150
because he is not here.

87
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:08,900
-From the social security?
-I just have to.

88
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,650
It's all too much for me, it's beyond my capability.

89
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:21,910
I don't want to go on socially, I don't want to be dependent and I have enormous difficulty to go

90
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:26,010
anywhere and say, please help me, it's terrible.

91
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:31,990
When I was pregnant in the 4th month, my father had another discussion with me and tried

92
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:36,490
to convince me to have an abortion because he sees my situation and he is afraid

93
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,340
he will have to help me.

94
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,750
Sorry.

95
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:07,090
-It's OK don't stop. No problem.

96
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:18,990
-And my mother told me it would be better if I would have a miscarriage because

97
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:26,740
I wouldn't be able to manage alone anyway. That's the situation how it is up to today.

98
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:34,320
When I prepared for this talk, I also thought that I might say some things about my childhood,

99
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,820
how the family situation was then but I don't know if it's important

100
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,420
and I don't want too much time of you.

101
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:50,670
Usually at home I can't cry, I can only cry when I'm very excited.

102
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:01,920
-Before I start asking questions, she can tell me what ever she likes to say.

103
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:08,400
-When I was a small child already, I always had problems with my mother.

104
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:15,150
I always felt unloved by her. I did strange things when I was small.

105
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:21,400
When I was 2 years old, I stopped eating, I didn't eat anymore and I did this for such a long time

106
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:27,250
that my parents brought me to a hospital, so that I would learn how to eat again.

107
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:35,310
In the meantime I have learned to eat again, unfortunately.

108
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:44,040
And there was also times when I was a small child that I purposefully vomited into my bed,

109
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,230
just that my mother would come once more and take me into her arms.

110
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,390
I can't explain what really happened between her and me, this is just how it was.

111
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:03,990
She always told me I was a desired child, they wanted to have me but I never was able to feel it.

112
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:09,560
-She is the only one?
-No, I have one brother.

113
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:21,210
He is younger two years. I had a grandfather who was very good to me, very kind

114
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:25,650
and I loved him a lot and we had very good understanding.

115
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:31,240
My grand father died when I was 4. My parents didn't tell me that he was dead, they didn't tell me

116
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:36,230
for weeks and months and even though I was such a small kid, I kept asking every day what's wrong

117
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:39,090
with grandpa, where is grandpa?

118
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:44,900
When they told that he had died, I developed such a high fever that I almost died.

119
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,250
It was way above 40 degrees Celsius.

120
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:56,150
-Does it ever happen again this, that after bad news she developed such fever?

121
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:08,240
-Besides this I'd like to mention that my father was very dictatorial father.

122
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:14,730
He did not tolerate any contradiction, any opposition within the family and in spite

123
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:21,500
I dared repeatedly to contradict him because I just had different opinion.

124
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:28,500
And I was beaten repeatedly, very often during my childhood, especially every time I contradicted him.

125
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,850
They always only beat me, my brother was never beaten.

126
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:45,200
-Why does she think was this? Because she was very obstinate?

127
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:59,100
What was the difference between her and her brother? What does she think?

128
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,350
Because she was obstinate or because they loved her less?

129
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:07,860
-I'm not sure. I think maybe because my brother would not endure as much as I was able to endure

130
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,450
in my childhood.

131
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:19,350
And within our family we had constant conflicts about tiny little things, nothing important really;

132
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:24,300
there was a constant conflict between my parents, between my parents and my grand parents,

133
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:32,350
in the entire family and today I'm very, very sensitive to any kind of conflict, arguments,

134
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:33,950
I can not bear it.

135
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:40,760
When I had different opinion from my father, there were two possibilities for him to react;

136
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:48,010
either he beat me or he told me you are twisted in your thinking, you have strange thinking.

137
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:50,610
And I heard that almost every day.

138
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:55,510
My father terrorized us as children psychologically.

139
00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:02,110
For example he would repeatedly tell during the day to eat fruit.

140
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:07,760
-Do you like fruit?
-My brother and I, we don't eat any fruit.

141
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,610
-She hates fruit.

142
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:16,950
-I think fruit is very beautiful and very healthy but I just can't eat it very often.

143
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:23,930
-And like every day he told me, you are not supposed to put butter on your bread

144
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:28,180
otherwise you will become as much fat as your mother.

145
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:35,030
-Does she like butter?
-Very much.

146
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,260
I enjoy it really but I don't have to have it every day.

147
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,180
-Is she feeling hot or cold in general?

148
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:49,430
-In general I'm sensitive to any kind of temperature. I'm sensitive to cold, I'm also sensitive to heat

149
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:53,280
but I can endure cold better than I can endure heat.

150
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,180
-Is she having any salivation during sleep?

151
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:04,280
-I don't know but I think not because probably I would realize if the pillow was wet.

152
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:12,680
-She is grinding her teeth?
-Yes very much, during sleep very strongly.

153
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:19,110
So strong that I've already broken some outer parts of my teeth.

154
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:24,360
-Is she afraid of the dark?
-No.

155
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:35,180
-She has any fears?
-Very large fear of spiders.

156
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,430
-Only.

157
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:41,280
-Besides that of course fear of the war but who doesn't have this?

158
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:53,930
-Another fear, of thunderstorms, dogs?
-No, I love animals.

159
00:16:55,030 --> 00:17:08,180
Animals are my big love. And always when I'm here there is some animal that comes to me

160
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,030
and wants to stay with me and I keep while I'm here.

161
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:17,280
-Perspiring a lot?
-No.

162
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,680
-Does she have any headaches?

163
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:27,710
-Yes, I frequently have headaches, strong headaches and when I was a child

164
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:32,560
I had headaches that were so strong that I was weeping from pain, as a child.

165
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:44,480
-Where they were?
-I can only describe how it's now.

166
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:52,380
Within the last 8 weeks the headaches were mostly there when I awoke in the morning

167
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,980
and it was a dull pain.

168
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,710
-The whole head?
-Yes.

169
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:07,710
-This headache can become worse from the sun or from any movement?

170
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:20,970
-Yes, heat aggravates. And it's ameliorated if I press with my fingers in the hollow of my eye.

171
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:27,210
-Does she have any feelings or ideas about committing suicide?

172
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:35,810
-Not anymore, not since Nat. mur. I think. Before I had many and often but not anymore.

173
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:42,010
-Did she take Aurum?
-No.

174
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:46,630
-Is she sighing a lot?
-Yes, very much.

175
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:54,630
Not now because I'm excited but during lessons very often and also in my free time,

176
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:57,060
only not now because I'm excited.

177
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,840
-Is she jealous? A lot?
-Oh yes, I think so.

178
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:10,410
-She can wear clothes tight around her neck?

179
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:16,410
-It's uncomfortable. What I wanted to tell you, I have problems with my thyroid.

180
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,220
-It's hypo?

181
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:27,560
-Function wise it's border line to hypothyroidism but I mainly have nodes and cysts in there.

182
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:33,210
-How is her thinking? Is it clear or is it clouded?

183
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:38,680
-I can think clear but I have problems of concentrating over a long period of time.

184
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,580
-The desire for butter is strong?

185
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:53,910
-It's not that strong, I can go without for weeks, it's not that strong.

186
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,910
-What about fat in the meat?

187
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:01,110
-If it's soft and slimy I can't eat it. But a little bit it's OK.

188
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,360
-Salt?

189
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:07,420
-I like taking salt, I always add salt to my meals.

190
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:18,030
-And this adding of the salt came after Nat. mur. or it was there before?

191
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:21,830
It was before already.

192
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:26,420
I realized here I have enormous problems climbing stairs, ascending.

193
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,270
It's so exhausting, it just takes my breath.

194
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:36,520
-Feet cold or hot in bed?
-At the moment warm.

195
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:44,520
-What about her thirst?
-2,5-3 lit per day.

196
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:50,500
-Not for cold?

197
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:55,490
-It doesn't have to be ice cold, it actually doesn't matter.

198
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:08,150
I really have to tell you one thing. A colleague advised me to take Palladium.

199
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:14,650
I took Palladium two weeks ago because with all the other grief remedy,

200
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:22,830
more or less I've been through and I just don't want to experience this pain anymore.

201
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:28,410
-The pain in the heart?
-Yes.

202
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:49,280
-Phosphoric acid she has taken?
-I'm not sure, it's possible.

203
00:21:53,010 --> 00:22:00,400
I wanted to say that I have very strong desire for tobacco meaning to smoke and I'm really angry

204
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,960
at myself because I cant' stop it.

205
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:11,580
I don't want to harm my child but I tried to stop smoking twice and it's just really impossible.

206
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:15,210
When I stop smoking, I can't think anymore, I'm so nervous.

207
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:17,060
It's unbearable.

208
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,490
-She drinks coffee also?

209
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:26,960
-I don't drink any coffee anymore but I used to enjoy it very much, I like the taste of coffee

210
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:31,310
and also this feeling that gives you of being a bit more awake.

211
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:39,560
-The exhaustion is very great?
-Yes.

212
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,210
-Eggs she takes?

213
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:54,460
-No, I dislike eggs, very seldom I take but I don't like them. I also don't like to drinkmilk,

214
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,170
milk for me is slimy.

215
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:09,420
-Her character is to be quite or to be aggressive?

216
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:18,040
-It's hard to say, in general I'm quite calm but if I'm under stress, I become highly irritable,

217
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:24,290
very easily and I have to invest a lot of strength not to explode and minor

218
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:27,390
explosions can happen repeatedly.

219
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:35,640
-Does she have any fear from high places?
-No.

220
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:53,300
I have very swollen ankles, especially the right one is very swollen.

221
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,010
-During pregnancy?

222
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:08,050
-I've always had the tendency to swollen ankles, even before the pregnancy but it really got worse.

223
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,810
-Bathing in the sea has she found out if it gives any amelioration?

224
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:21,940
-Yes, it does give some amelioration.
-Certain.

225
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,810
-Did she ever have gonorrhea?
-No.

226
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:29,060
-Any discharge from vagina?

227
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:36,160
-As a child I had some kind of infection of the lower abdomen with leucorrhea but not in the past years.

228
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,460
-When she sleeps which side she keeps?

229
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:50,040
-I can not sleep on my abdomen, not just because of the pregnancy but in general.

230
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:58,640
I mostly sleep on my side, even before pregnancy.

231
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:04,730
I never was able to sleep on the abdomen, even before the pregnancy.

232
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:09,480
-She likes ice-cream?

233
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:20,130
-No, except salt I don't have any pronounced desire or aversion.

234
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:23,140
-She is very sympathetic to pain for others?

235
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:30,390
-Yes, I'm often noticed this especially with patients who are sitting up in front of me

236
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:33,140
and describe their pains, I could feel their pains.

237
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,640
Or I brought a friend who have had a knee operation, I brought him to the doctor and for

238
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:44,240
the rest of the day I couldn't walk anymore because I then had such strong pains at the same spot.

239
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:53,390
-Nails are strong?
-Yes.

240
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:03,750
-She has an anxiety about her health?
-No.

241
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,640
-She wakes up refreshed or unrefreshed?

242
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:17,530
-Completely unrefreshed. It's even worse than when I go to bed at night.

243
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:26,330
-She said the water drinks it cold?
-I prefer to be a little bit cold than too warm.

244
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:34,080
-And she takes 3 lit?
-Yes, two bottles of this is very possible.

245
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,730
-She was always very thirsty?
-No.

246
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:46,980
During the last 4-5 years I've developed this thirst. And what I wanted to say my symptoms in general

247
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,280
haven't changed in this entire time period.

248
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:52,280
Basically they stayed the same.

249
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:03,050
-She said about eggs but exactly is aversion to eggs?

250
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:08,790
-No, it's no aversion, I can eat them but I don't need them.

251
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,300
-She can or she can not eat fruits?

252
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:19,400
-I can eat some pieces of fruit but not more than one piece per week.

253
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:29,030
-She has taken Pulsatilla ever?
-Yes, I took it once in my life.

254
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:34,510
That was the end of practitioner school, I had been the class speaker and I was very close

255
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:40,630
to the people, I liked them very much, so when one after the other left, this hurt me so much

256
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:43,980
and then I took Pulsatilla and it helped me.

257
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:57,540
And I have a desire for fresh air. In class I have to go outside in between because I can't stand it

258
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,090
and if I may add, when the two of us entered the room here, the first thing she  said was,

259
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:09,220
this is bad air in here and we opened the window to get fresh air.

260
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:12,320
-She eats pork?

261
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:17,670
-I can eat it but I'm not crazy about it. In general I don't eat much meat at all.

262
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:24,510
A little piece of meat once every two weeks, that's sufficient, maybe even less.

263
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,760
-Fish?
-I like to eat fish.

264
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:38,520
-Her menstruation was anything particular?

265
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:44,520
-When I'm under stress the irritability before menses was clear often

266
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:48,020
but otherwise no problem whatsoever.

267
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,370
-The blood is how many days?
-3 days.

268
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,510
-Clear blood or clotted?

269
00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:02,270
-I think it's difficult to tell if you use tampons. I don't know if it's normal because blood coagulates

270
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:07,460
a little bit, if you use tampons, sorry to say. Otherwise I didn't see any clots.

271
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,520
-Does she have any important symptom she did not tell?

272
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:17,270
-When I'm under stress and when I'm nervous, I bite my fingers.

273
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:28,520
And I would like to add that I'm very unhappy with my figure, with my weight.

274
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:36,930
I don't eat very much but it's incredible difficult for me to lose any weight and in general I like to fast,

275
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:42,610
when I'm fasting I feel better overall and this helps me to control my weight.

276
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:50,260
In the beginning of the pregnancy, within 3 weeks I gained 8 kilos, just like that.

277
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,970
And I hate it.

278
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:05,870
-The thirst is the same big or it is only during heat?

279
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:12,110
-Of course the heat increases the thirst but in general I'm always quite thirsty.

280
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:14,710
I like to drink and I feel it does me good.

281
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:21,820
-She likes to be with the company of the people or she likes to be alone?

282
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:26,320
-With dear people yes I like to be but I wouldn't want to be with anybody.

283
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:30,320
There are certain people I don't feel I'd like to be with and in general

284
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,920
the desire for company has decreased.

285
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:41,560
I just realized also that I'm so sensitive right now like a raw egg and I have a great fear to be hurt.

286
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:54,740
-In general looking back in her character, would she say she is obstinate and

287
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,300
if she wants something she would do it?
-Not at all.

288
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:02,940
As a child also and as a young woman I had hardly any self-confidence.

289
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:08,840
I mean over the years, I've gained some, thinking of the fact that I started from scratch

290
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:15,340
I did accomplish some things but in general I'm not very strong and I have rather problems

291
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,190
with the power of my will and I'm not very well organized.

292
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,090
-If somebody is hurting her, does she forget or she remembers it always?

293
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,690
-I remember.

294
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:35,940
-And she wants to retaliate?
-No.

295
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:49,310
-Was any tuberculosis in the family?
-Not that I know of.

296
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:03,560
-She eats bananas?
-Once in a while.

297
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:14,010
I don't know if this is of any help and maybe it's the same for everybody but the mosquitoes

298
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,020
are feeding from me here.

299
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:21,960
On my lower left arm alone I have 7 mosquitoes bites and they go on me everywhere,

300
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,570
on the face and in every free spot.

301
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,940
-The only thing she is afraid is spiders?

302
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:37,690
-It's not real claustrophobia but for example here in class I have a very narrow sitting place,

303
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:42,690
right between the window, the wall and somebody else and every day it's a real challenge

304
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:46,440
for me again to go in there and sit there and endure this.

305
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:50,700
But I can't just start screaming and say, hey somebody else come on and trade places.

306
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:56,040
So I try to endure but it's very uncomfortable, I don't like it.

307
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:04,540
-She is taking Belladonna?
-Yes.

308
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:19,190
-How much she would underline the desire for salt?
-Twice.

309
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:27,110
-Lemon she likes?
-Not so much.

310
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:43,340
I don't know if this is of any help, years ago I tried to kill myself with an overdose of tablets

311
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,490
after a broken relationship.

312
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:53,180
It is just that I think I have to do something for myself now and not only for myself

313
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,030
but also for this child.

314
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:04,230
-The grinding of the teeth is very old symptom? As a child she remembers it?

315
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:10,530
-I don't know if I had it as a child but definitely when I was a young woman, I already had it.

316
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:23,240
I definitely had it when I was 23 and whether I had it all along I can't tell you

317
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:26,260
because if I sleep alone, how shall I know?

318
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:35,160
But I realized it 3 weeks ago because I woke due to the fact that I have broken a part of my tooth.

319
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,410
The pain in the neck is quite strong right now.

320
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:47,160
-This pain is affected at all by draft?
-No.

321
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,610
-She likes the draft of air?

322
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:55,340
-No, I don't like draft so much and I try to avoid draft by covering my neck and my shoulders

323
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,920
but I like fresh air.

324
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:07,740
-She has no other pains or other problems?

325
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:16,690
-Last year in May I had a severe pyelonephritis and this was caused by a kidney stone

326
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:22,940
which has gotten loose and it went to the urethra and I had very high fever

327
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,370
and I had a septic condition.

328
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:30,830
-And she took antibiotics?
-Yes I had to.

329
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:35,920
I was in hospital, it was a life threatening situation and I had to take.

330
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:40,490
-How many times she took Pulsatilla?
-Only once in a C200.

331
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:43,990
-And what was the effect exactly? When it was?

332
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:52,570
-It was in December 1995 at the final celebration of our school and before I was just

333
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:57,740
watching the people of my class living one after the other, I had the feeling that is breaking

334
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:05,740
my heart and I felt the pain and I felt that I can't endure it any longer and I took Pulsatilla

335
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,620
and afterwards I felt better.

336
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:12,580
-Just for that pain only, not in general.

337
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:18,070
-I didn't feel any other changes but I have to say I drunk coffee immediately the next day again

338
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:20,170
because I wasn't real homeopath yet.

339
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:08,080
This was the most difficult case so far.

340
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:15,850
I could not make a decision for this case.

341
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:30,730
I don't understand the reason, maybe she is too timid to say things deeper or maybe because

342
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:33,740
of the remedies she has taken already.

343
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:40,580
They have confused the case but this definitely is a confused case and I can not make a decision.

344
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:54,080
I have to work now again in my house and see if I can come down to some kind of logical conclusion.

345
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:07,830
Either some information is missing or the case is really confused.

346
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:17,480
It doesn't look like any remedy, you don't put together the main things, the strong grinding of the teeth,

347
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:26,920
the desire for salt and sighing and this here.

348
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:40,560
This is another contradiction that on one hand she seems dependent, on the other hand she says

349
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:47,320
I don't want to be dependent from anything, even from the social security from my father or from anybody.

350
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:53,500
She goes ahead and she keeps the pregnancy while the problem is there whatever it is.

351
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:01,400
So there are contradictions in my, not being able to put things together for one remedy or at least for

352
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:09,400
the first remedy, which has to be a remedy which is exhausted. I didn't feel she was so exhausted

353
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:13,900
when she talked, that's another contradiction.

354
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:22,320
She said I'm exhausted mentally, emotionally, physically and she cried very much but she has

355
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,510
strong emotions, I felt.

356
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:28,830
Then she said, no emotions, I don't have emotions, my emotions are quite low.

357
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:47,730
-I was thinking on Causticum and maybe we should ask some questions because she said

358
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:57,080
she was always contradicted on father in childhood and she has a very big love for animals.

359
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:08,160
-Causticum don't love animals. It is afraid of animals, all animals, typical Causticum.

360
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:19,670
Love of animals is Aethusa, because she loves animals and because she has aversion to milk.

361
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:34,820
-My feeling the whole time was for Pulsatilla. If you remember how she opened her case

362
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,500
and how she closed it with the last example, when she took Pulsatilla.

363
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,900
She gave the example of the feeling that it's breaking her heart and that is what she also said

364
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,150
in the beginning.

365
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:52,930
Something is tearing her heart apart, a knife in her heart, a strong pain and it was relieved

366
00:40:53,030 --> 00:41:00,980
with Pulsatilla. Pulsatilla can be very controlled, very strong outward, if she has to cope alone.

367
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:08,570
They can not at all look like the classic Pulsatilla we know but I felt it before and I talked

368
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,200
to her again just now.

369
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:31,400
The deepest inner longing actually would be to be able to let go and to receive some help

370
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:40,390
but since there is no help around, the only possibility to clench your teeth, not to become soft,

371
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:47,810
not to be overwhelmed but to continue alone. And that can be Pulsatilla in this stage if the situation

372
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:54,810
is like this. When we came here, I forgot the cause of the incident, I think it was when she was selling

373
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:57,810
the T-shirts downstairs.

374
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:02,810
The break was over and I said, come on let me carry your suitcase upstairs,

375
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:05,640
you are pregnant and everything, you can use some help.

376
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:10,650
And she said, no, no I always have to do everything alone, I can do this on my own.

377
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:15,650
I said sure you can, everybody knows you can, you have to prove it again and again

378
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:21,560
but now there is a situation, accept some help you don't get it every day and she said, no,

379
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:26,810
no please if you tell me this, it makes me cry almost immediately, don't, don't.

380
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:34,820
It was almost overflowing and she just managed to hold herself together.

381
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:41,310
No matter if general symptoms or if anything fits or not, from how I understand Pulsatilla

382
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:45,160
can be very well be the other side of the matter.

383
00:42:52,910 --> 00:43:05,310
-I don't think that she wants pity. I don't agree. She is too proud to accept some help for

384
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:08,410
which she thinks, she has not done anything.

385
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:17,660
If she has worked and has produced this and she wants to sell, you want to buy, OK.

386
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:24,260
But you can not give it back, she doesn't want it.

387
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:37,490
She has been vaccinated for rabies?
-Yes, twice.

388
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,360
-Twice with the injection in the abdomen?
-Yes.

389
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:53,860
Because I was in the practice of a veterinarian doctor and when the second

390
00:43:53,960 --> 00:44:01,210
injection set of injections was done, I had very strong reaction swelling of lymph nodes.

391
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:05,960
-We have several possibilities. Tell me a possibility.

392
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:54,540
Ignatia, Pulsatilla, Nat. mur., Staphysagria, Carcinosin, Lyssinum, Phosp. acid Medorrhinum.

393
00:44:55,290 --> 00:45:25,790
We vote. Pulsatilla, who votes for Pulsatilla? Ignatia, Nat. mur.Staphysagria, Carcinosin,

394
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:45,790
Lyssinum, Phos. acid, Medorrhinum?

395
00:45:54,540 --> 00:46:04,040
Can we use the rubric sympathy aggravates? Show me this rubric.

396
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:26,390
This rubric says Ignatia capital, Belladonna, Calcarea, Platina and Silica, Arsenicum,

397
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:34,040
Helleborus, Kali sulph., Nat. mur, Sepia, Sulphur and Syphilinum.

398
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:54,680
I have chosen for her a very dynamic remedy, in spite of what she said,

399
00:46:54,780 --> 00:47:08,280
in spite of what she showed, I've chosen a very dynamic remedy with great presence.

400
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:33,450
A remedy which grinds her teeth very badly. Grinding Apis, Belladonna.

401
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:47,200
During sleep? Tuberculinum has to be very strong here, it's not this the right rubric.

402
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:54,950
Now it is. Tuberculinum, Cina.

403
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:10,180
She is a difficult character. Not only she challenged her father several times, as she said

404
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:17,790
but she also took the chair and broke it.

405
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:24,180
-I did that because he lied right into my face. He told me I never beat you.

406
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:32,780
-You did very well, nobody said you didn't. You did very well and according to your remedy,

407
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:44,560
expressing anger. It's a volcano.

408
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:54,310
You remember what he said? I like his observation, my observation is also the same.

409
00:48:54,410 --> 00:49:05,260
She is a volcano, suddenly exploding but Belladonna has so much weakness?

410
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,770
Let's see.

411
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:23,530
Underline once.

412
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:43,930
Belladonna has quite strong weakness and restlessness, at the same time.

413
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:47,530
Belladonna is very restless and very weak.

414
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:07,930
Stramonium also can be an idea because she has received the injections but don't forget that

415
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:16,010
Belladonna and Stramonium look alike but the difference is that Stramonium almost invariably

416
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:20,260
has fear of dark, which she does not have.

417
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:28,730
So I chose Belladonna because she does not have fear of dark.

418
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:34,760
Stramonium also has strong fear of dogs, Belladonna also, they are similar remedies,

419
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:39,600
similar in their explosions.

420
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:57,850
Belladonna is more explosive and Stramonium is more violent. In their explosion they hit, they strike.

421
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:08,110
-I forgot something to mention. Pyelonephritis. That's a strong indication for Apis.

422
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:25,350
-Apis is not a bad idea and I have thought about it and the repertorization shows ...

423
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:57,600
Good bye. Show me Belladonna.

424
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:15,850
Thirst for large quantity is also a symptom which made me take out...

425
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:28,100
mind, aggravation from sympathy, thirst large quantities, desire for open air, unrefreshing sleep.

426
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:34,100
Also there are some symptoms of Phosphorus with her.

427
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:44,350
Milk aversion, cold drinks desire, grinding teeth in sleep.

428
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:54,350
-I'm stick to the idea of Staphysagria because of this tremendous anger and this ...

429
00:52:56,350 --> 00:53:01,250
-Suppressed anger.
-And because she is throwing things.

430
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:07,330
-I can tell you she is not suppressing her anger now when the students are talking.

431
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:15,620
She immediately reacts, she says, no, no... nonsense, I'm not like this, there is no suppression.

432
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:27,100
Suppression to Staphysagria acts totally different. Staphysagria is subdued, she is not reacting.

433
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:43,950
She is reacting. Good luck, Belladonna 10M with a possibility that she will go to Calcarea carbonica,

434
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:52,590
as a deeper remedy later, because she had exhausted herself and these are

435
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:57,690
signs of exhaustion but I can not give her Calcarea carbonica.

436
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:09,180
She is not, she is too strong while she complains she is not feeling her energy but

437
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:19,280
maybe what she says for her, feeling tired is not like others who really feel tired and exhausted.
