1
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:36,180
This is a case of a child, it is a male child four years old

2
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:52,100
which came on October 1977, he comes for the first time.

3
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:06,100
His mother said that he is suffering with a skin eruption for the last two years.

4
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:21,840
Dryness of skin is underlined twice, there are white areas of skin which are wrinkled

5
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:35,350
and the skin is worse on the inner surfaces of the joint, here and back.

6
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:49,200
Worse in general in lower extremities and in the lower hands.

7
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:11,450
Certain points are more swelled up and more red, the skin is dry and rough.

8
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:18,680
The itching is quite strong, underlined twice.

9
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:27,430
The dryness of the skin is also underlined twice in the whole body but mostly in the places

10
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:35,270
where I told you. The itching is worse before he goes to sleep.

11
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:42,680
Many times it's bleeding because of scratching.

12
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:53,690
He has used different ointments, cortisone as well, without any effect.

13
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:06,770
The mother says that he is a quiet boy, he has no problem, he is fastidious

14
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:15,280
and especially in his dressing, he likes to dress well.

15
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:28,670
The fear of dogs underlined once, fear of dark, it is a sensitive child

16
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:38,870
and he is easily hurt, if somebody hurts him. He is shy.

17
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:52,570
There are no aversions and there is only one desire which is underlined, it is ice-cream,

18
00:03:52,670 --> 00:04:06,060
underlined once. Fish, milk, omelet, no underlines in these.

19
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:13,730
His thirst is normal, nothing special with temperatures.

20
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:30,580
Five months old he had a generalized staphylococcus.

21
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:43,830
-Skin infection?
-Yes. He sleeps well and wakes up well.

22
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,100
Do you like this case?

23
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:13,350
What it appears to be wrong with that case?

24
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,970
-It's very difficult to get the sense of the child.
-That's one.

25
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:41,970
-We don't know the causation.

26
00:05:53,720 --> 00:06:05,470
-You see a case like that which has no real, vivid symptomatology, a generalized skin eruption

27
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:15,800
which is also not strong appears that something is lacking in vitality in that boy.

28
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:37,210
Which shows that the condition is quite serious and the fact that is not suppressed

29
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:44,050
it's perhaps because it is too generalized, too much in the whole body.

30
00:06:49,310 --> 00:07:00,630
Whether it is the boy's defenses or the doctor who is taking the case, we don't know.

31
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:08,530
Actually this taking of the case shows a poor rapport between the doctor

32
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:13,030
and the mother most probably because it is not the child, it is the mother

33
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,780
who gives the information.

34
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:22,360
And a mother who is not very much observant and you have this case to work with

35
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,460
and you will see how many mistakes we have made in that case.

36
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:36,410
I would like to see whether you will make the same mistakes.

37
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,880
You want to analyze such a case.

38
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:10,040
You look in your Repertory if you want some information, the most logical...

39
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:14,880
but you don't like the logical now, you say George is prescribing.

40
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:24,630
But the remedy which covers the totality, if you take it, it's Phosphorus.

41
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:39,730
-Because of the fear of the dark?
-Yes but this is what it's written there.

42
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:49,860
Anyhow all these prescriptions that you made are wrong and mine was wrong also.

43
00:08:52,360 --> 00:09:02,280
But mine always when I prescribe unfortunately is quite close.

44
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:12,690
I shall give you the report after Phosphorus 1M I prescribed.

45
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:20,440
Most probably that was a poor rapport of the mother and the doctor

46
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:27,670
because the next visit they make, they decided to change the doctor

47
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:31,360
and to go to another doctor of the Center.

48
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,610
They have the possibility to change over, the patients.

49
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:47,860
-What's the date?
-The date is the 24/11/77.

50
00:09:54,110 --> 00:10:04,860
The report says up to the 20th day the child was quite well. I don't like to hear that.

51
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:20,370
See the continuation. From the 20th day onwards the skin cleared up completely.

52
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:33,290
Until the 20th he was quite better but after the 20th he was completely well.

53
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:45,690
You don't like to hear this reaction in a child who is suffering for two years

54
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:48,780
with such severe eruption. You don't like it.

55
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:55,770
You want first the eruption to come out and then you are happy and satisfied.

56
00:10:55,870 --> 00:11:00,520
Otherwise you have to wait.

57
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:09,020
There is only left some itching only on the hands but it's scratching quite a lot in the hands,

58
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,210
especially in the night and he may wake up in the night and scratch.

59
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:24,470
General psychological state quite good. That's very strange.

60
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:33,830
Appetite is better and pick up some weight and generally he is in good condition.

61
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:39,520
Desires and aversions the same. Sleeps well.

62
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:51,010
In the place where the skin was worse, it starts the color of the skin to be the natural type

63
00:11:54,110 --> 00:12:04,600
and it has a dry eczema on the back of the hand. This is the report.

64
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,770
Now what did I do?

65
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:36,480
I said to you because I know what has happened later on that this is not a good reaction

66
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:42,630
but when you really fist see it, you may be proud of your prescription.

67
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:48,810
You think it may be not so severe as I thought and it maybe has just gone away

68
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:55,670
and different things like that but I don't like this.

69
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:02,920
Being aware of that, is it possible that you prescribe any other remedy?

70
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:06,570
Do you have any information to prescribe anything else?

71
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,480
-No.

72
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:12,950
-Do you have any information to change the remedy or to repeat the remedy?

73
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,380
Never in such a case.

74
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:21,890
You have to wait, you have to give placebo and see what happens.

75
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:29,460
So that was done, placebo.

76
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:45,780
The interesting thing is that in the first report you see the eruption, what you expect

77
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:53,640
it might be a suppression and you don't see any irritation inside, that is peculiar.

78
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:10,790
He comes on 4th of January 1978, two months and a half later and he says

79
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:16,630
that the condition of the skin has remained steady.

80
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:22,210
That means that the back of the head and the itching and the skin is better.

81
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:30,130
10 days ago he had a staphylococcus infection.

82
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:40,630
-Of the skin?
-Of the mouth.

83
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:54,370
The doctor asks of an X-ray of the lower jaw to see if there was any effect of that

84
00:14:55,630 --> 00:15:05,890
but the report says about the child that he is more demanding now and more capricious.

85
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,870
Actually very capricious.

86
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:25,930
He says I want my milk now, the mother brings the milk and he says now you brought it

87
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:30,040
I don't want it. That kind of things.

88
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:39,290
I feel cold, the mother brings something to warm him, he says now I feel hot, take it out.

89
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:45,430
He cries much more and complains much more than before.

90
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:56,220
He has become more aggressive.

91
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:09,280
Itching is quite strong and especially when he does not direct his attention somewhere else.

92
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,620
In his sleep he scratches.

93
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:36,510
He scratches his hand and the back of the knees quite strongly to the extent

94
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:46,760
that he bleeds them, no changes in desires and aversions but it says

95
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:54,790
that now he desires pastry and fried liver.

96
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:16,530
Thirst is normal and he is not anymore so much timid and not as affectionate as he used to be.

97
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,200
So you see the changes.

98
00:17:52,350 --> 00:18:00,010
-The infection is around the mouth?
-Inside the mouth.

99
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:07,370
-Did he take something?
-No, it went by itself.

100
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:17,620
Now he starts having a picture, a symptomatology

101
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,530
and he has some mental-emotional symptomatology now.

102
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,290
Especially this capriciousness is very strong.

103
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:45,780
Tell me if you can find the remedy now.

104
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:57,780
Evaluation so far of the case, what has happened?

105
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:06,530
Most probably here we have a case of suppression.

106
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:23,380
Next evaluation we have to make is whether we should give a remedy or not at that stage.

107
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:30,870
We have a suppression but during the suppression we have noticed many times that the

108
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:42,540
remedy becomes more clear and there are some symptoms to help you, to guide you.

109
00:19:47,550 --> 00:20:02,640
The tendency is that now the remedy is more clear according to my understanding.

110
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:08,470
For you is it more clear the remedy now?
-Yes.

111
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,680
-What is the remedy?
-Sulphur.

112
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:23,170
-Another one?
-Chamomilla.

113
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:43,670
-Very good. No, I prescribed Cina 200 one dose because of the makeup of the child

114
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:49,020
that he became from quite child, he became so much capricious and all that.

115
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,260
-How do you distinguish?

116
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:05,320
-Chamomilla would be more shouting and screaming, this child is more give me that,

117
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:11,170
no I don't want, give me that, no I don't want, the description is more Cina.

118
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:31,170
We don't know, we don't trust. Now we are taking chances.

119
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:53,490
It says that 10 days before taking Cina the skin eruptions started breaking out already.

120
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:59,740
That means after having been suppressed then it starts the organism by itself

121
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:11,740
to throw out again the eruption and in spite of that it has a time between going to the office

122
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,490
and taking the remedy.

123
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:21,500
The remedy is prescribed a few days later because I had to see the case and go back

124
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,740
and take the prescription.

125
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:33,660
That is the time lapse of 10 days where it says now that an aggravation of the skin

126
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:39,510
has started before taking the last medicine already.

127
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:57,900
He had a great aggravation of the skin condition before taking the remedy

128
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,650
and that continued also 10 days after taking Cina.

129
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:05,540
-This is the follow up after Cina?

130
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:11,540
-Yes, I'm reading to you the follow up after Cina.

131
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,560
-What date?
-That is 78.

132
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:30,780
The itching was very strong and now it's gone.

133
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:39,540
The whole situation now on the skin is settled down.

134
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:50,290
The capriciousness became much worse during the skin aggravation.

135
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,780
Now it's less.

136
00:23:55,460 --> 00:24:04,450
Yes, before the remedy the aggravation of the skin became much worse and then it came down.

137
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:23,950
This month the child was crying quite a lot and he became quite violent in his behavior.

138
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:33,100
It sleeps well and sleeps on the abdomen, desires ice-cream and cold water,

139
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:41,780
desires rice underlined twice, pasta and sweets,

140
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:55,380
he is not very timid anymore, cries very easily, he is very demanding and he is cursing.

141
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:59,130
He starts cursing.

142
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,880
You look up in your Repertory.

143
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:46,080
You see the illusion that keeps him coming, it is that he is doing better.

144
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:50,830
You gave him a remedy in the beginning for two months, then you give another remedy,

145
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:58,920
there is an aggravation, it's better now, the child keeps coming but have made the mistake.

146
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:09,660
They may feel that something has been done but actually nothing has been done

147
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,100
so far for that child.

148
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,510
What is your evaluation?

149
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:57,270
Anybody wants to evaluate what is happening and tell me what to do?

150
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:10,240
-I think it's suppression because in personality it's going worse and worse, more violent,

151
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:19,430
more cursing...
-Yes, there is a further suppression.

152
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:30,910
The eruption is better but not entirely.

153
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:38,010
Still there is some skin eruption outside, it's not the whole thing suppressed now.

154
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:44,410
So what is the evaluation? What we have done?

155
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:48,170
I gave Cina the second time, there is an aggravation of the skin

156
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:53,240
and it appears to be the right action.

157
00:27:53,340 --> 00:28:02,330
Then after 10 days of big aggravation, there is sedation, he does not anymore

158
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:06,330
become so much capricious but he has this violence.

159
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:12,920
That means the eruption is inside. Great part of the eruption is inside.

160
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:33,930
Here I've made a mistake. Let's hear what you will do.

161
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:44,440
-Anacardium.
-I would give him Stramonium.

162
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:57,180
-What do you expect if you wait? Now we have made quite a lot of mistakes already.

163
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:02,850
But anyhow it's a good answer.

164
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:09,860
-You wait...

165
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:17,010
-This is a solution. What you will do?

166
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:33,850
-I go back to the original case and see if something is coming up.

167
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,600
-Difficult.

168
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:47,350
-Chamomilla.
-Hyoscyamus.

169
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,090
-Medorrhinum.

170
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:03,770
-I'll tell you what I have given. I prescribed Anacardium 30.

171
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:15,850
I go down the potencies and as I told you I'm a bad prescriber when I prescribe wrongly.

172
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:23,160
Taking Anacardium he says great amelioration on the skin.

173
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:27,910
-How long?

174
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:36,100
-For many days and eventually for two weeks the skin became like velvet he said.

175
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:51,260
-What is the date?
-17th of March 78, like velvet!

176
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:09,420
After these two weeks of velvet skin a terrible aggravation, the whole thing came out

177
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:13,260
and now it's in a terrible state the skin.

178
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:23,910
The itching is three times, the child is scratching all the time, the whole 24 hours

179
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:34,340
it's scratching, worse in heat, redness on his face and redness on his legs.

180
00:31:46,350 --> 00:32:03,850
The sleep is good, he still says bad words, he doesn't cry so much.

181
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,770
What we will do now?

182
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:23,700
-The rest of the emotional state?

183
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:28,160
-The rest of the emotional state he says, he is not so timid anymore

184
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:33,930
and he does not cry easily. There is no information.

185
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,930
Now the skin is bad.

186
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:11,830
Less aggravated, the emotional state is better of course because the eruption is out

187
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:16,660
and the emotional state has been relieved quite a lot, he is not violent,

188
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:22,760
he just uses bad words but not stressed so much.

189
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:33,860
Skin is on a worse condition that it has started.

190
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:40,750
-Has Anacardium antidoted the process?

191
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:46,490
-No, what happened here is that with the homeopathic remedy you

192
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:57,010
pushed the eruption inside and the organism is angry with that.

193
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:59,760
This is exactly what happened.

194
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:04,160
There is enough vitality and it brings it out.

195
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:11,180
That's why we say there is no problem if you wait. You give the wrong remedy, you wait.

196
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:17,180
Sometimes it is 1,2,3 months at the most and the thing will come back.

197
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,500
-He may actually be proving Anacardium.

198
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:25,500
-No, because he has the cursing and all that before Anacardium.

199
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:30,440
Now he does not have so much the violence. He had violence.

200
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:35,990
We did it in the wrong order.

201
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:44,280
First ameliorated the skin, that's why I do not consider that Anacardium had really acted.

202
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:51,650
What it has been done here is that the doctor who was taking the case

203
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:55,510
was not very conversant with the Theory.

204
00:34:55,920 --> 00:35:03,560
So by himself thinking that Anacardium has helped the velvet skin, he prescribed

205
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:14,640
by himself a 200 because 30 is lasting only one month and he prescribed 200

206
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:24,320
and here is what happened one month later, 21 of April 78.

207
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,410
You see how much useful is that Theory?

208
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:41,250
You see when they say better, better, forget it. I want to see first the reaction.

209
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:48,650
-What you have seen?

210
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:58,890
-First the aggravation of the skin, immediately the skin, amelioration of this

211
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:04,820
aggressiveness and then better, better, better.

212
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:13,720
What I saw here is better first and then the aggravation. Wrong remedy.

213
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:16,830
That observation is standard.

214
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:31,730
It ameliorated the skin, made it clear, it is a definite action of the remedy

215
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:34,580
and it is definitely wrong action.

216
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:55,210
Now he takes Anacardium 200 for 23 days. He says the 23rd day the redness

217
00:36:55,310 --> 00:37:17,720
and the roughness of the skin started going down but the itching did not withdraw

218
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:27,410
and finally they had to use Phenergan, this is an antihistamine drug.

219
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:39,450
He wakes up many times in the night and scratches,

220
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:54,490
scratching worse in the night before going to bed, scratches and bleeds,

221
00:37:54,590 --> 00:38:02,590
psychologically he is better, he continues to use bad words,

222
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:21,230
he has no capriciousness and if they make a remark, he won't talk or if he talks

223
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:23,730
he will complain about it.

224
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:37,830
He sleeps well, fear of the dark is there, he does not want egg as he used to want,

225
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:51,090
he has some boils on his fingers, he has no reaction from weather cold or hot.

226
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:07,410
You see how we spoiled the case eventually?

227
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:22,820
Now you have a case where - and this happens many times - you don't have any

228
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:37,900
symptomatology to go by, the condition remains rotten and the best course of action is placebo.

229
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:51,900
So placebo was given and he comes on 10th of June 78...

230
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:17,540
We left about two months of observation and he says that this month was very bad,

231
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:24,400
the whole situation was quite bad, especially the last 15-20 days.

232
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:39,240
He had an inflammation under his nail and the nail came out.

233
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:17,640
Also a boil in the chest with itching and pain, general dermatitis with severe itching,

234
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:26,460
scratches until it bleeds, worse during night in sleep, he doesn't want to wear long punches,

235
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:44,650
he wears short punches, skin is quite dry, also great itching on the genitalia.

236
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:56,810
They bleed with scratching. He behaves like a grown up person,

237
00:41:57,310 --> 00:42:05,810
he wants to put everything in order, he is quite fastidious.

238
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:15,970
For instance he wears his pyjamas to drink his milk, he dresses with his night dress

239
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:25,300
to drink his milk, if he sees a button missing it is a big deal.

240
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:35,560
He wants to be dressed properly, his shoes...

241
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:52,650
He wants his bed very nicely and tidily made,

242
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:08,640
has great patience, he takes a lot into consideration the restrictions

243
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:18,130
that the doctor tells about his treatment not to drink coffee, not to take camphor,

244
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:20,630
he is very serious about this.

245
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:33,480
He doesn't use any more bad words, he has an aversion to eggs now and to fish,

246
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:45,260
desires rice twice, desires ice cream twice and wants cold water, underlined twice.

247
00:43:49,270 --> 00:44:00,260
He perspires on occiput during sleep and here I've made again another mistake.

248
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:10,810
I went back to the original case, I looked again, I looked here

249
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:13,420
and I said this is again Phosphorus.

250
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:22,850
So the first Phosphorus has not acted, maybe something has happened,

251
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:26,750
let me give it again but now in 200.

252
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:32,590
So I gave Phosphorus 200.

253
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:44,980
The remedy has become clear now but something put me off the remedy.

254
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:52,590
Already I should have spotted the remedy at this moment and the remedy is not Arsenicum.

255
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:16,570
He comes in 8th of August 78 and he says that as long as he was in the sea, he had no problem,

256
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:19,160
the skin had cleared.

257
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:29,650
The moment he comes back from the sea, the whole situation starts all over again.

258
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:34,150
-At the sea?

259
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:41,990
-At the sea and in the sea. He goes and swim in the sea.

260
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:57,140
Since he stopped taking sea baths he has again the same condition, his skin became dry again,

261
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:08,400
redness in certain places, itching worse when he becomes warm, psychologically the same,

262
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:24,150
desires the same and the doctor writes here in my question he says, he does not answer me

263
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:35,070
but he goes to the mother, he says the answer and that's how he communicates.

264
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:53,990
The doctor writes that his sister had a lot of warts, perspires a little bit on the occiput.

265
00:46:56,740 --> 00:47:00,640
What did I prescribe?
-Medorrhinum.

266
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:07,330
-I made a mistake again. I prescribed Medorrhinum.

267
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:22,330
The previous interview I read it to you and you will see the remedy.

268
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:46,830
-What potency?
-Medorrhinum 200.

269
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:06,820
He comes 28 of May 79, he disappeared after Medorrhinum.

270
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:20,570
He decided to come back, he said no amelioration at all during that whole period.

271
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:30,820
He has constant itching, dryness and becomes red.

272
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:51,240
One day he was scratching with that hard thing, he is scratching around his head now.

273
00:48:54,990 --> 00:49:02,720
The scratching is voluptuous, the child now is six years,

274
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:07,580
he has grown up with this eruption and with good Homeopathy...

275
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:15,820
He scratches all the time.

276
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:30,310
Worse lying in bed until he goes to sleep he scratches, he is stood first in the class,

277
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:51,820
he is obstinate, he wants to do what everybody says, he is feeling the heat more now.

278
00:49:52,810 --> 00:50:00,310
Desire for sweets is underlined twice and desire for ice-cream underlined twice,

279
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:04,070
desire cold drinks underlined once,

280
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:19,210
sleeps on the abdomen, there is a slight constipation if he does not eat much green stuff,

281
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:34,310
perspires a lot in the cervical region and on the forehead, the sweat is offensive,

282
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:44,070
at school he is perfect, he is very fastidious doing his job.

283
00:50:53,730 --> 00:51:08,230
His nose, he cannot breathe because of growing of adenoids and his tonsils are swollen.

284
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:14,510
Finally I gave him the right remedy.

285
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:33,100
Going back especially the previous report where I gave Phosphorus 200.

286
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:43,850
That report I should have started with Sulphur.

287
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:51,930
I just decided not to think of Sulphur the other time but that time?

288
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:58,420
Because there is an aversion to eggs and aversion to fish, both are in Phosphorus.

289
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:11,160
And the child looked to me more as a Phosphorus child but I know the fastidiousness of Sulphur

290
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:26,760
and I told you many times Sulphur is very fastidious and it did not click.

291
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:45,760
Finally on the 28th of May 79 it was Sulphur 200.

292
00:52:56,770 --> 00:53:09,670
The child did not come back until September 81, one and a half year later where he says

293
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:20,660
he has been well all this time but he had an acute situation for which he took antibiotics

294
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,100
and the whole thing relapsed.

295
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:38,830
He has now again flare up of the dermatitis, with intense itching, scratches a lot,

296
00:53:38,930 --> 00:53:52,770
worse in warm, he went in the sea, it was summer, he was not better in the sea.

297
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:59,520
He was not ameliorated by the sea this time.

298
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:08,840
So I give him again Sulphur 200.

299
00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:41,670
Then he comes on 15th of July of 82, one year later and he says the skin eruption

300
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:52,510
was very well until one month ago where he was on an island where he got a bronchitis

301
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:58,270
and he took again antibiotics and again flare up.

302
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:14,350
There is a relapse and I've given a dose of Sulphur 1M and that is the last report of that child.

303
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:20,350
Somebody has spotted the remedy from the beginning.

304
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:34,840
He has developed a boil which is painful and itching, this is Sulphur,

305
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:48,990
great itching, scratches until it bleeds, worse in the night, underlined three times also,

306
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:53,850
that is Sulphur.

307
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:10,090
Kent may have not have noticed but it is one of the very common characteristics

308
00:56:10,190 --> 00:56:23,080
of Sulphur because Sulphur has great itching and by the effort to scratch it will bleed.

309
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:44,080
Then he is so fastidious, the child is very fastidious.

310
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:50,830
I know that Sulphur is fastidious and I should have thought of Sulphur already in that case

311
00:56:50,930 --> 00:57:00,830
because there is the itching, the boils, even the inflammation on the fingers,

312
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:12,180
great inflammation with fever which sometimes is threatening, many times it's covered by Sulphur.

313
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:33,400
Then he has developed an aversion to eggs, see aversion to eggs and aversion to fish.

314
00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:46,500
Aversion to eggs is Phosphorus, Kali sulphuricum, Ferrum, Sulphur and Nitric acid.

315
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:59,750
Aversion to fish you will see again Sulphur.

316
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:14,500
Perspires on the occiput. At this point I should have given Sulphur already.

317
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:23,100
When I made the mistake of Phosphorus then most probably I went to look back,

318
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:32,830
so I could see the trace of Sulphur going through the case which I did not notice.

319
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:36,080
Then finally I prescribed Sulphur.

320
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:50,730
The sea, that was a characteristic that most probably went away with Medorrhinum

321
00:58:50,830 --> 00:58:55,080
because it was not there when I prescribed Sulphur.

322
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:06,990
It's very difficult here to say whether any of these remedies have done something to produce,

323
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:13,470
because there is an aversion to eggs, an aversion to fish,

324
00:59:13,570 --> 00:59:17,360
the amelioration in the sea which is gone...

325
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:24,460
There are changes which are pointing towards Sulphur more clearly.

326
00:59:25,210 --> 00:59:33,340
So it must have been some of these remedies, one of them or two that have produced

327
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:40,610
the picture of Sulphur more clearly than definitely was in the beginning.

328
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:48,750
-If you look at the first case and you leave out the ice-cream, you have dry skin,

329
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:52,760
 itching worse at night and fastidious.

330
00:59:53,870 --> 00:59:57,360
-You can say but you have the information there, it's written.

331
00:59:58,110 --> 01:00:05,860
Every case that you will repertories, it will come Sulphur and that's another fact.

332
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:10,270
And you are aware of that and you don't see any characteristic of Sulphur

333
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:23,350
in the beginning except of the fastidiousness, without having anything to support that.

334
01:00:26,350 --> 01:00:31,180
-Where did you go in the first remedy?

335
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:39,100
-They seem typical of what remedy?

336
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:46,350
-You said the child liked ice-cream and then fear of the dark.

337
01:00:48,350 --> 01:00:52,430
-Because I had nothing else to do, I had no information.

338
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:57,340
You use that information, it's written there after all, you say you are justified

339
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:04,160
to give that remedy. All the other it is conjecture.

340
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:08,290
You cannot go completely away from the information that you have

341
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:10,140
when you prescribed the remedy.
