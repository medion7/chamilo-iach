1
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:28,060
Today I'm going to show you a case which nobody has seen before

2
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,990
because I took it yesterday night.

3
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:55,840
The hero is a member of the class and I would like you to think together,

4
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,940
we are searching for his remedy.

5
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:08,210
So everybody is going to participate in finding his remedy.

6
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:20,530
Then you will see the results of your decision next year.

7
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:39,850
It is a very interesting case, that's why I'm eager to present it and to analyze it

8
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,030
as it's fresh in my mind.

9
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,770
-You have been treated...

10
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,610
-When I first have been treated I didn't know what it was.

11
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:56,290
I was having tenderness and some pain. So I started from there and then I went to homeopath.

12
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:10,180
It was on May 1981 when I started having a lot of tenderness and pain in the epigrasic area

13
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,760
and underneath in the liver area.

14
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,780
And I was admitted to the hospital in July of 1981 in emergency.

15
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,110
After having me for a week they couldn't find what was wrong with me,

16
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,450
so they told me that probably there is anything wrong with me.

17
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:37,860
They told me just go away, they gave me pain killers.

18
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,610
They didn't know what was wrong, it must be something very rare.

19
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:50,280
So I just had the pain until January of 1982, then I heard about Homeopathy.

20
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,020
I decided before any treatment I would find more about it.

21
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,760
So I started taking homeopathic course by somebody in England and decided that

22
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,270
I would go for treatment.

23
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:08,620
This was about 2 months after starting the course. He gave me Carcinosin 30

24
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:18,220
which had no effect on this pain at all. In February 1982 he gave me Thuja 30, still no effect.

25
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:25,790
On March of 1982 he gave me Tuberculinum 10M and the next day I started having severe cramping.

26
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:32,630
I would turn white, sweat would pour down my body and I start having constant diarrhea.

27
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,030
-For the first time?

28
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,210
-For the first time, I never had diarrhea in my life.

29
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,290
I can eat all kinds of food and I never get diarrhea. All of a sudden I started having diarrhea.

30
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:50,470
I was told that this was homeopathic aggravation and just go through it. That's all right.

31
00:03:52,560 --> 00:04:00,280
Then for about 2 months I was having this diarrhea and pain and then gradually it cleared up,

32
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:05,450
it went back to normal and I went back again. He said that was great aggravation,

33
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,950
tremendous results.

34
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:12,210
Now what we need to do is to tap it up and just clear the rest of the miasm.

35
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:21,560
Then I was given Tuberculinum CM. Next day the diarrhea came back, pain.

36
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,970
Two months later.

37
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,710
This man had a symptomatology and he was given different remedies and finally

38
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:49,860
he did not have any action and finally he was given a remedy that had tremendous aggravation,

39
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,800
tremendous reaction.

40
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:57,710
He complained for pain in the epigastrium and pain in the liver region, he was given a remedy

41
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:01,870
and then diarrhea started, severe diarrhea for the first time of his life.

42
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:10,040
For 2 months he had diarrhea, the diarrhea cleared up and the practitioner said

43
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:16,300
we must boost this reaction by another dose of Tuberculinum.

44
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:27,370
Let's understand that because if you don't understand the Theory you will see the story

45
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,630
which is coming.

46
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:34,810
When do you have a homeopathic aggravation?

47
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:04,310
-When the symptoms for which a person is complaining are aggravated.

48
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:17,230
Then you have an aggravation and the symptoms must take the right direction.

49
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:40,210
-In this case do we have an old diarrhea coming back?

50
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,620
-No.

51
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,170
-He said I never had diarrhea in my life.

52
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:54,280
There is a deep effect upon the organism but you have to understand one thing,

53
00:06:54,380 --> 00:07:00,780
in order to have a homeopathic aggravation you have to have eventually an amelioration.

54
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,960
This is a rule.

55
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:11,820
If the aggravation is homeopathic, then you have a cure after the aggravation.

56
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:19,320
If you have an aggravation, especially if the aggravation continues for a long period of time,

57
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:26,870
without a final amelioration, then you don't have a homeopathic aggravation.

58
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:33,720
It is an aggravation which comes if you give a remedy, which is close to the case but not exact.

59
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:41,890
This remedy was close, a kind of layer for him.

60
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:48,620
But which layer? Not the first layer, not the first remedy that should have been given

61
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:56,570
because otherwise he would have felt very well after the aggravation,

62
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:05,820
the aggravation would not have lasted for so long and the aggravation also is taking

63
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:17,220
where the intestines were inflamed, now they ulcerate. From inflammation goes to ulceration.

64
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,630
This is not a homeopathic aggravation.

65
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,540
Therefore not knowing the Theory, what is the logic?

66
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:42,390
He says that was the right remedy, take another dose now, take another dose.

67
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:47,060
If he knew the Theory, he would never have done it.

68
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:55,870
He would say I made a mistake, don't touch again Tuberculinum in this case.

69
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:02,570
Instead of saying don't use Tuberculinum under no circumstance in this case,

70
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:11,050
he says let us take another dose, not only that but we are going to take it from 10M to 100.000.

71
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:17,120
What is going to happen? What do you expect to happen if you have a sensitive person

72
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:22,190
to Tuberculinum and you give Tuberculinum constantly, you give CM every day?

73
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:26,880
He didn't give every day but one dose was enough to produce what you will hear.

74
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:53,110
-Diarrhea came back, intense pains in the abdomen and he said this is an aggravation.

75
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:56,130
I thought it lasts very long, that's fine, that's OK.

76
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:00,030
Then the idea was that probably it is a proving of Tuberculinum.

77
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:06,940
So I thought this is interesting, I will find what Tuberculinum is, so I started taking notes

78
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,880
of Tuberculinum proving, I thought after this I'll try Syphilinum proving.

79
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:22,780
But what happened was that it just stayed until I started wondering this is wrong,

80
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:29,790
I'm getting weaker and weaker, I started having hemorrhaging from the bowels.

81
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:38,960
-At what time?
-Probably in 1983, I started having hemorrhaging.

82
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:50,690
I went back to him not knowing what to do. At one point he told me Natrum Sulphuricum,

83
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:54,690
It looks like the remedy, Natrum Sulphuricum came no effect.

84
00:10:54,790 --> 00:11:06,790
Then in July I saw another homeopath, much more experienced and in July I was given Rhus tox 1M.

85
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:15,950
I had an aggravation but inside aggravation, I was very irritable and depressed

86
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:22,450
and that lasted for a week, then it cleared up. The stools became normal.

87
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,270
-For how long?

88
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:28,210
-For about 2 weeks and then it all started up again.

89
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:41,450
After a remedy you may have an aggravation, mental-emotional aggravation.

90
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:45,700
Can you have and still the remedy can be correct?

91
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,850
-Sometimes.
-No.

92
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,540
-Sometimes they say yes, sometimes no.

93
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:57,100
It could be, in which case you may have a mental aggravation?

94
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,260
-In psychological.

95
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,520
-In case we have mental problems. These mental problems can be aggravated for a time.

96
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:14,950
You are treating a person for a mental condition and he is aggravated, he is mad or he is...

97
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,460
This is OK the aggravation.

98
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:25,690
His own symptoms are aggravated, his fears are aggravated for a few days, his mental

99
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:30,270
-emotional symptoms are aggravated and you treating him for mental-emotional symptoms.

100
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:36,850
But if you are treating him for a colitis and the colitis gets better

101
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:41,110
while the mental symptoms are aggravated.

102
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:49,700
By the time he is aggravated, then colitis is better. Wrong prescription again.

103
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:07,680
I have to note that the first homeopath and the second homeopath, the first I do not know

104
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:11,530
but the second I know very well, they are good homeopaths.

105
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,690
The first one I do not know because he should know that he should not touch Tuberculinum

106
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:22,270
but still he does not give a lot of remedies.

107
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:29,190
He waited until the aggravation was cleared up, until the proving was cleared up

108
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:38,400
but left an effect. The second is knowing what he is doing.

109
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:47,800
Still you will see after we finish the case, how careful we must be in analyzing a case,

110
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:54,720
understanding the case and taking the right course of action because of that condition.

111
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:04,440
-It all started up again but I wasn't in a position where I could contact, I was travelling in Europe.

112
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:12,600
So I saw him again and it went back at about 20-30 bowel movements the day.

113
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:17,490
-Some of them were with blood, mucus?

114
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:23,190
-No mucus, just blood, not all the time but quite often blood.

115
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:27,660
Then in November I saw him again the second homeopath

116
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,940
and he prescribed me Natrum muriaticum 10M.

117
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:40,660
I had lost a baby in February, my daughter died and I was quite upset about that.

118
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:50,510
But I was exhibiting signs of Nat-m. and...

119
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,080
I want to point out another point here.

120
00:14:54,180 --> 00:15:03,370
When you have a condition going on and while the condition is going on there is a grief.

121
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:12,250
Unless there are drastic changes on that condition, grief is not considered.

122
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:16,020
He lost a child, it doesn't matter. It did nothing to him.

123
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:22,700
It doesn't mean that anybody who loses a child needs Ignatia or Natrum muriaticum.

124
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:26,870
Some people they just go over it without an effect.

125
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:35,610
In order to give here Natrum muriaticum, you have to have a drastic change in the picture

126
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:40,890
after the loss of the child and you have a new picture and you see a picture before

127
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,430
and a new picture now.

128
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:46,280
Yes you are justified to give Nat mur.

129
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:52,770
But if you give Nat mur while the picture is continuing and of course it is not covering

130
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:56,530
the whole picture, the remedy is not going to act.

131
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:01,680
These points you have to have in mind.

132
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:06,250
You ask me Materia Medica and I will give you Materia Medica but the Theory

133
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:10,340
is much more important and nobody understands the Theory I can tell you.

134
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,990
Because when I see even my best students doing such mistakes, that means

135
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:21,520
they have not understood the Theory. And I said so many times these things.

136
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:43,340
-I had an aggravation inside once again, depression, crying, sadness and I didn't know

137
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,990
what was wrong with me and my bowels.

138
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:54,000
I was back in Canada at that time and I started drinking, brandy and I would go into

139
00:16:54,100 --> 00:17:01,940
melancholic states, crying...
-That happened after Nat mur?

140
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:21,920
Do you see this is not immaterial with the remedy because Nat mur makes the people closed,

141
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:27,770
they close up and how do they open? By drinking.

142
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:36,330
Nat mur will open up if you drink a few glasses of wine and then you become loquacious.

143
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,270
You can't stop talking then.

144
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:48,270
What he says during the proving in Nat mur? He becomes melancholic and he needs to drink.

145
00:17:49,180 --> 00:18:03,430
It is a proving of Nat mur. If he goes out of the phase of Nat mur he will stop drinking.

146
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:40,500
Be very careful with high potencies and with low potencies and learn to take seriously

147
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,420
what the person is saying.

148
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:51,920
Take the case seriously and before you give a remedy, understand that this remedy...

149
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,770
I'm quite happy now.

150
00:18:55,180 --> 00:19:00,780
First of course learn the Materia Medica to match because to be quite happy

151
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:06,100
if you know 10 remedies, it's dangerous.

152
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:14,410
-Take brandy, gin, I hated the taste of alcohol but I just felt like being drunk all the time.

153
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:34,500
So I did that about March of 1985 and then I got tremendous hemorrhagic,

154
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,680
40-50 bowel movements the day.

155
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:44,520
I was trembling all the time and I saw a friend who is a medical doctor

156
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:47,600
and he said something very wrong is with you.

157
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:53,100
I knew that I was sick this time, I haven't told anybody except my wife of course

158
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,450
but not family, my friends, nobody knew that I was sick.

159
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,350
-Did you work?
-Yes.

160
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:06,200
I was seeing patients at the same time, making excuses to run out of the room all the time.

161
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:12,350
Then he admitted me to the hospital, they took blood, my hemoglobin was 60

162
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:20,740
and he said you have to have some blood transfusions and then sent me to a specialist

163
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,370
who diagnosed Chron's disease.

164
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:28,440
He suggested I would take cortisone, I told him I will not take cortisone.

165
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:36,110
I phoned my homeopath once again who prescribed Mercurius, the hemorrhage stop.

166
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:42,950
I was having mass of hemorrhage like a bottle of blood just dropped out of my hands.

167
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:49,700
Mercury stopped the hemorrhage at that point.

168
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:02,950
Then in July I got a very severe cystitis.

169
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:11,270
-The effect of Mercury lasted?

170
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:17,040
-Diarrheas kept on, cramping kept on but the hemorrhage stopped.

171
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:24,270
-Did you have a general effect?
-No, no effect inside.

172
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:31,190
Then I got Nux vomica 10M because I had the cystitis and very strong symptoms.

173
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:38,020
Giving Nux vomica 10M cystitis got better but not changing in the bowel.

174
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,030
It stayed the same.

175
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:50,020
Inside I felt increase of energy, joyfulness came up but I was so weak that if I did anything,

176
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,360
just climb many stairs I was exhausted.

177
00:21:53,460 --> 00:22:00,190
So what happened very soon the effect of Nux vomica was gone, the cystitis didn't come back,

178
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:04,110
I didn't feel good feelings inside, anymore.

179
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:10,780
Then I had Phosphorus prescribed, good feelings inside but again something happened,

180
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:17,210
I must had lifter a chair, exhausted, good feelings went away.

181
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:28,770
I was given Calcium carbonicum 200 no effect, Sulphur 200 no effect, Arsenicum 1M.

182
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:32,120
At this time what happened was that the weakness improved.

183
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:40,290
I would walk around and everything would be dark and I couldn't hardly see where I was going.

184
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,780
But no effect in the bowels, the weakness got better.

185
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:53,870
Prescribed Veratrum album no effect, Carbo vegetabilis the bowels firmed up slightly.

186
00:22:53,970 --> 00:23:01,110
Slightly felt but there wasn't much good feeling, nothing much but then after about a week

187
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,780
the bowels once again.

188
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:14,790
They were about 20 bowel movements the day I was prescribed Crotun tiglium no effect from that.

189
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:27,190
Then in July of 1986 Natrum arsenicum was prescribed.

190
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:32,110
There was some increase in energy, no change in the bowels.

191
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:39,360
Then I was prescribed Phosphorus and then what happened was the next day the bowel

192
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:45,770
movements, I would have 2 bowel movements where I had to rush to the toilet all costs.

193
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:50,790
I was just losing my stool in my pants. That happened to me before.

194
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:54,860
-You lost stool unnoticeable or you could not retain?

195
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,770
-Not retain, I have no retain in my bowels at all.

196
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:01,020
-No power of retention.
-None.

197
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,620
-As soon as it comes you have to run.

198
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,870
-I have to be in the toilet or I have to hold my anus.

199
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:11,420
I have to close it physically with my hand or it comes out.

200
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:16,950
So what happened was the bowel movements, then I had about 8 the day,

201
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:21,190
I could just slowly go to the toilet, 2 would be rush to the toilet.

202
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:29,530
Normally I would wake up from getting the Tuberculinum up to this time,

203
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:34,440
I would wake up 6-7 times the night to go to the toilet.

204
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:39,110
Sometimes I would be up for 4 hours in the night, so forget about 3 hours of sleep.

205
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:45,230
So I started having 1 bowel movement in the night, 2 rush bowel movements in the day,

206
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:49,830
6 bowel movements where I could calmly go.

207
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:57,360
Inside what happened I experienced overwhelming feelings of devotion, pray fullness.

208
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:05,540
This lasted for 2 months. All day I would walk around feeling ecstasy of a feeling inside myself.

209
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:09,610
-Pray fullness?

210
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:19,110
-A kind of feeling of adoration for the universe. It's not mental, it's from my heart.

211
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:23,520
-Were you involved with some kind of spiritual movement at the time?

212
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:32,130
-I had been up to 1978, I was still meditating but very disillusioned.

213
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,440
-You went to different gurus?

214
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:42,780
-No, I went to a guru in 1970, I became a teacher to his meditations and then at 1970

215
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,920
I became quite disillusioned.

216
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:54,560
I just started again having these strong feelings, I had them as a child always inside.

217
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:58,610
-You had feelings of adoration?

218
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:08,190
-Feelings of joyfulness, feelings of praying it would be like god I love you so much.

219
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:12,710
This feeling inside. No words but feeling.

220
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,190
-How long it lasted this period?

221
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:23,360
-Two months and what happened was I drove down to southern interior to see my sister,

222
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:27,450
the feelings went away and I knew that I'm in trouble.

223
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:30,610
About 2 days later the bowel movement started again.

224
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:33,030
-What was the remedy before?

225
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:39,790
-Before Phosphorus? This feeling was after Phosphorus 1M.

226
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:47,450
Another effect that it had was that at 1975 I had asthma.

227
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:53,310
There was worse in the winter or I would get a cold or if I would get upset stomach,

228
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:59,800
I would have wheezing and was able to walk around in the winter.

229
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:06,950
I still have it but the asthma got better.

230
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:11,710
So Phosphorus 1M was prescribed again no effect.

231
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:17,790
March 1987 Phosphorus 10M no effect.

232
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:23,360
-This repetition of Phosphorus did not aggravate the whole situation?

233
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:33,810
-What happened was that I started developing a large mass in my lower right quadrant

234
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:42,780
and I woke up one morning in such pain, I thought I must have appendicitis.

235
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:49,950
It was so intense, I thought this is it, I'm dying, I couldn't think so my friends

236
00:27:50,050 --> 00:28:00,960
rushed me to the hospital. I got there, they thought you have probably a peritonitis.

237
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:05,780
So they said if you don't accept that treatment, there is nothing we can do.

238
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:14,610
So I said fine I can't take that pain right now. So they put me into antibiotics treatment

239
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:20,440
and cortisone 16mg and kept me in the hospital for 2 weeks, no food and they had

240
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:27,710
a surgeon check me every day but that cleared up.

241
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:36,690
Then I phoned my homeopath again because I was still hemorrhaging, cortisone didn't do anything

242
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:39,120
for my bowels, no effect.

243
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:44,860
They put me on Asacol hd which is related to aspirin

244
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,200
and that was supposed to replace the cortisone.

245
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:54,450
So I'm taking that and it doubled the bowel movements, I got tremendous aggravation from it

246
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:58,200
and back to the hospital, big swelling in the lower abdomen.

247
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:10,100
Then they said you should go on chemotherapy.

248
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:16,680
I said you keep that, keep the cortisone, keep everything and I took myself off.

249
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:23,510
-You walked out of the hospital?
-I couldn't walk because of the pain.

250
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:27,080
-During the week they gave you cortisone and all this?

251
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:35,200
-I was in cortisone anyway because I wasn't able to come out, I was on 60 mg

252
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:43,450
and they took me down to about 30 mg...

253
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:59,990
-Then it subsided quite a lot, the pain, the swelling?

254
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:05,160
-Yes but I've had it since, I didn't go to the hospital.

255
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:12,660
I just decided I won't go back there. So I just have it for about a week now.

256
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,660
-So you got periodical crisis now?

257
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:23,080
-Very bad, swells up, this under here becomes very painful, painful to touch,

258
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:29,990
I can't sleep because of the pain, I curse, I pray, nothing works.

259
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:37,580
It's very painful, I have to stop eating, I become very weak during these flare ups.

260
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:45,600
After I got at the hospital the second time we prescribed Mercurius corrosivus

261
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:52,160
because I was hemorrhaging again but I was still in cortisone. Hemorrhage stopped.

262
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:58,160
Then I lost contact with the homeopath because I had to phone him and I couldn't move,

263
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,910
I couldn't find his phone number anymore.

264
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:07,670
So I went to another homeopath in Canada whom I considered better than the one I had

265
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:14,240
and he prescribed Nux vomica 12C to try to come off the cortisone.

266
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:19,740
Coming off the cortisone was horrendous. Now I just laid in the bed,

267
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:26,080
I couldn't move my arms, I couldn't move my legs, I was freezing cold, shaking

268
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:29,270
and I went through that for about 2 weeks.

269
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:38,240
He prescribed the 12C, no change in my bowels, still 20 movements the day,

270
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:44,640
then Silica 200 was prescribed with a slight increase of energy.

271
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:50,540
-What was the remedy?
-Silica 200 with not much results.

272
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:57,640
Then I was prescribed Magnesium muriaticum with no results, Phosphorus 1M which he didn't prescribed

273
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:01,090
but I got a very bad bronchitis.

274
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:08,460
I have a tendency to get cold to my chest, so I went back in the Repertory,

275
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:13,590
it looked like Phosphorus. I took Phosphorus, a day and a half later it was better.

276
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:18,550
It lasted 2 weeks and then I phoned and he said wait, maybe the Phosphorus will affect

277
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:20,470
your bowels as well.

278
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:23,900
No effect on my bowels at all.

279
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:30,340
Then prescribed Rumex crispus no effect, Colocynthis no effect.

280
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:38,140
I had Sulphur about 3 months ago and what happened was 3 days after taking the Sulphur

281
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:50,720
I had passed 2 bowel movements formed, because I don't have formed bowel movements

282
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:57,050
and I got an eruption on my left forearm, which also had come out

283
00:32:57,150 --> 00:33:00,650
with the Natrum muriaticum some time ago.

284
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:11,390
-Other than these 2 stools, one normal and then back again?

285
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:17,640
-It had 20 bowel movements and during the day with these 20, one of them was formed.

286
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:20,060
-How old are you now?
-38.

287
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,050
-And the whole thing started 7 years ago at the age of 31?

288
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:25,400
-31-32.
