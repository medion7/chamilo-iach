1
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:07,570
-I hear you had some acute problems. What happened exactly?

2
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,150
-I strained my left leg.

3
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:20,550
-Then what happened? What did you feel?
-It hurts when I walk.

4
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:28,800
-It hurts when you walk. Where? The whole muscle there or in the joint?

5
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,040
-Yes.

6
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:34,650
-There is any swelling of the glands there?
-No, it's a strain.

7
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:43,320
I know how I did it. I did it doing some exercises to improve my knees

8
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:51,390
which were strengthened and it started then but it just got worse and worse.

9
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:03,550
-And now you have to walk with a cane?

10
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:11,030
-Well this is just today because my dear lady who runs the hotel she just borrowed that

11
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:17,790
from her father in law. It just can't take any weight or any force now.

12
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:23,030
I can stand but if I want to put the muscles on effort, they complain

13
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:31,040
and they become very painful and then all the walking muscles just cease up

14
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,890
and I' m just exhausted.

15
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:39,790
-I heard you were taking pain killers? What kind?

16
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:43,810
-Anti-inflammatory drugs because it's something that helped.

17
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,530
-That means you have done it before?

18
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:55,040
-As far as I can see or experience this is an acute problem of a chronic problem

19
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,680
that I have and this is a rather vicious attack.

20
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:03,360
Something that is been going on for quite some years and one way or another,

21
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,870
a lot of the time I feel quite lame.

22
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:14,140
-A lot of the time?
-Yes, increasingly the last 10 years.

23
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,870
-In the same place?
-No, this is new.

24
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:25,340
I've had exactly the same thing here, about 8 years ago, not as aggressive or acute

25
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,600
but lasted about 2 years , the same thing on the back of my thigh and the same thing here.

26
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,580
This has compromised my walking muscles severely.

27
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,180
It's a like a myalgia.

28
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,580
-Have you taken remedies for that?
-Yes.

29
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,340
-What remedies?

30
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:54,110
-If I think back starting the very first one, I worked at the London Homeopathic Hospital

31
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:59,600
and I saw Peter Fisher and I think the first remedy I ever had from Homeopathy

32
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,330
was Rhus Tox because we thought this is a fibromyalgia.

33
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:10,090
Then the next one was Natrum muriaticum.

34
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,080
-You are a medical doctor?
-Yes.

35
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,160
-And you have a specialty?

36
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,750
-I come from a long time in general practice and in the last few years

37
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:24,090
I've taken a different direction, one of which is Homeopathy.

38
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:26,770
-Very good.

39
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:33,340
-Starting with Rhus tox that was the first time I ever took a homeopathic remedy and

40
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,930
I was very excited; nothing really happened. This is several years back.

41
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,240
Then Natrum muriaticum, because they were thinking there was a background to this

42
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:02,910
which we may not go to hear and after that it was the time of my menopause,

43
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:10,390
so some Lachesis and then I think I gave up from Homeopathy.

44
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:18,050
This was a lot of aggressive pain which prevented me cycling, prevented me walking

45
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:22,810
and restricted my mobility a great deal.

46
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:28,400
It comes and goes. I have an acute episode and I think it's getting better.

47
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:36,890
I had acupuncture from time to time and manipulation and a range of things

48
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:46,390
and short of various resolving this, which is a strange thing

49
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:51,530
because apart from this I'm a very active, healthy...

50
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:03,900
I think other remedies I've had...

51
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:10,060
The next homeopathic remedies when I got involved with Homeopathy on a course

52
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:19,130
in London and we were all looking for remedies for each other and I had some Ignatia.

53
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:26,280
Then I went to see doctor [name] who is Director of the hospital

54
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:31,860
who is very elderly and then I had a sequence of things.

55
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:38,770
When it was very, very bad, aggressive in the buttocks, in my gluteal,

56
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:45,930
on my walking muscles, I had a sequence of Sulphur and then Dulcamara

57
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:55,950
and then Cimicifuga without any lasting effect.

58
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,680
-None of these remedies had any effect on you?

59
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:05,440
-The only remedy that I thought helped me and that's by looking back was the Lachesis.

60
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:10,790
That was before I went away on a year's sabbatical.

61
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:21,110
It's very difficult and more recently I've been using much more locals.

62
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:27,540
Myself I always thought that this was more a ligament problem.

63
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,610
-Did you even have rupture of a ligament?

64
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:38,940
-No. I used Ruta quite a lot in Arnica as local.

65
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:46,210
-Ruta and Arnica you use a lot?

66
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:56,050
-Regularly. Sometimes I thought Ruta helped a bit, I'm never quite sure.

67
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:06,550
I have to say, when I'm like this I have found the most helpful has been the balsam fir

68
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:10,790
but that only lasts for a short time and then it ceases to act.

69
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:11,880
-It ceases suddenly.

70
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:15,380
-Ceases to act, then I have a break and then I can take it for a few days.

71
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:20,870
-So pains start usually suddenly or gradually?

72
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:28,370
-It always seems to be the result of a strain. I had a lot of trouble with the attachments

73
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:34,540
on the country here, which I think it was brought by cycling but I always cycle

74
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,790
and I think some time I over did it.

75
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:39,050
-Did you ever take Calcarea Carbonica?

76
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:50,390
-No. This is a very acute and a very aggressive one.

77
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,650
-It looks as if you have broken some muscular fibers.

78
00:08:54,750 --> 00:09:06,890
-Probably yes and strain the tendon. To me it feels like where the tendon attaches

79
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:11,980
to the bone, that's an inflammatory process.

80
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:17,750
I feel as if I have been moving around with chronic tendonitis on my pelvis.

81
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:23,020
That's what it feels like to me but there isn't a diagnosis for that.

82
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:39,880
-Most probably you have a sensitivity on your muscular system which is a little bit loose

83
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,630
and maybe strain.

84
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:46,380
-I have tender spots, so tender I can't bear to be touched.

85
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,880
-In your muscles?

86
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:55,720
-Generally here and I had extremely excruciating tendons so much that I can't lie or

87
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,960
let anything to touch me.

88
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:06,220
You know you have the seats in cars and I can't bear it, I have to hold it

89
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,220
and I haven't been able to lie on my side at night for a long time, it hurts.

90
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,460
-So there are sensitive spots on your thighs and buttocks actually.

91
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,230
-Yes.

92
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,370
-You are a more complicated case than we thought. Did you ever get Bryonia?

93
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,980
-No.

94
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:02,980
-Your general state is good you say or you have some general symptoms?

95
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:13,120
-This is my thing, this is my ailment. It actually limits my life. It has limited my life.

96
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,870
Apart from that I would say the rest of me is pretty well OK.

97
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:24,870
One thing that has changed about acute illnesses which we were talking about

98
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:32,040
and as well this is related because it comes much later, is that all the time I was

99
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:37,280
a general practitioner and I had my own family, I never got cold.

100
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,210
I was sick perhaps once every two years.

101
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:48,040
And then I had a little epidemic of grand children and since the last three years

102
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:52,540
I have had upper respiratory tract infection, one after another

103
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,450
and occasionally they are really so severe.

104
00:11:55,550 --> 00:12:02,220
I had to take some time off work and one homeopathy medicine that really helped,

105
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:09,800
I had a very nasty tracheitis to one of these infections and Hepar Sulphur helped a great deal.

106
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:17,210
But this has been very unusual for me although to have infection after infection...

107
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:20,960
-What was the year that you had the infections?

108
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:27,710
-The last 3 years since I had grand children. I catch them immediately from them.

109
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,450
-But the pains?

110
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:37,310
-Much longer. But that's a change in my health. Something different.

111
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:47,210
-From A group you went to B group. You were A group, you were in good health and

112
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:50,450
most probably you took some antibiotics...

113
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:55,270
-Never I took antibiotics. Antibiotics is not been my style.

114
00:12:55,370 --> 00:13:02,030
Pain killers sometimes when I have bad headaches but not antibiotics.

115
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:06,280
-When you had the first acute that was serious you didn't take?

116
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,600
-No, I wouldn't dream of taking antibiotics.

117
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,210
-Not even once?
-No.

118
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:20,610
-How you treated the first serious infection,  tracheitis or bronchitis?

119
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:28,110
How did you treat it?
-Probable a few lemon sips and hot lemon.

120
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:36,970
It doesn't make me ill, it is uncomfortable but it doesn't make me ill; this makes me ill.

121
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:42,770
Except one hormonic case that it did but I just had a few days in bed,

122
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:45,620
took a few codeine I think.

123
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,250
-Do you perspire in sleep?
-Not much.

124
00:13:52,350 --> 00:14:00,600
-If you do perspire, where it will be?
-Yes I do actually. Head.

125
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:05,930
And there is one thing I have noticed recently, which we look for changes.

126
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:15,160
It is that I perspire very, very much if I do any physical activity

127
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:25,670
and I've always perspired here, not much on my body but now if I was to do the housework,

128
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,420
I pour here.

129
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:42,010
-Your feet are usually cold?
-Very cold.

130
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:47,640
-In bed do you have to wear socks sometimes?

131
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:55,730
-I don't wear shocks because I think make me more like granny but I have to use electric blanket.

132
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,580
I get very cold feet.

133
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,310
-Sometimes can be cold and sweaty?

134
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:09,760
-No, never sweat feet. Sweating very much on head, here.

135
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,650
-Do you take a healthy diet? You are healthy conscious?

136
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:25,650
-I think so. I believe in home cook, lots of fruits.

137
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,150
-What about sweets?

138
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:38,900
-Here it might be a keynote. I adore sweets, not chocolate, children sweets.

139
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,740
-Sugar sweets.

140
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:47,500
-Do you ever crave of anything? I would crave, I would go out at night and get myself

141
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,240
some sweets and I always put this down to not having any sweets during the war

142
00:15:53,340 --> 00:16:07,340
but I do. I can crave for something more than chocolate and more than cakes.

143
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:16,830
-These Greek sweets like 'baklava' with a lot of syrup, you can take these?

144
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:25,770
-Yes I like them but I wouldn't crave them. It's actually sweets that children have in paper.

145
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:32,000
-What about eggs?
-I like eggs.

146
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:39,580
-In what form you prefer them? Soft, hard?

147
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:48,980
-I love hard boiled eggs, I like soft boiled eggs, hard eggs, I like omelets, scrambled eggs.

148
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:54,230
-All forms.
-Yes, I like them.

149
00:16:54,330 --> 00:17:00,840
-Tell me there is any aversion for food?

150
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:08,330
-I often think about that and I don't think there is.

151
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:17,490
-How much salt you use in your food?
-Just a bit but I do like salt.

152
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:18,990
-Not excessively.

153
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:25,840
-I would very unhappy to eat some chips without a bit of salt on but not a lot.

154
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:37,980
-Your nails are strong or they are a bit weak?
-I think they are strong but they are ridged.

155
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:45,330
My father had very ridged nails but they grow very quickly and they are strong.

156
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:57,480
-Do you have any of your toe nails going in growing, inside?

157
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,090
-The big toe a bit but not much.

158
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:04,670
-Do you have any fear?

159
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:20,170
-I fear of someone jump in the dark like most people do.

160
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:35,570
The fears I have would be deeper fears of being unloved, alone, those sorts of fears.

161
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:36,600
-Fear of poverty?

162
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:43,670
-Not poverty. I'm quite happy. It's not being loved.

163
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:51,820
-What about fear of dark? Are you afraid to sleep in dark room?

164
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,420
-No.

165
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:58,480
-Are you afraid of a high place to look down?
-No.

166
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:05,240
-Are you afraid when others are close to a cliff? Do you say, come in?

167
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,920
-No, just normally.

168
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:17,160
-Neither you are fearful of thunderstorms?
-No. I love it.

169
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:24,820
-You are not fearful of cancer? Developing this or that?

170
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:33,880
-I have a great fear about the family illness which is arthritis.

171
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:44,780
-But do you have a hereditary history like this?
-Yes.

172
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,450
-Your father?
-My father and my grand mother very much.

173
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:57,860
-Your weight is a little bit over. You try to keep it down?

174
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,110
-Well it's difficult. When you start exercising, every time you exercise something,

175
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:09,140
you strain something. The last few years my weight is more than it has ever been

176
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:17,350
and I can swim but I can't walk as much, I can't cycle now.

177
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:26,380
I'm very limited in the amount of physical exercise I can do, I'm very frustrated by that.

178
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,200
If I was normally, I would normally have walk up here and enjoy it.

179
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:39,390
I used to mount and rock climbing and here I am having to be brought up with the car and a stick.

180
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:43,480
-Have you find that your muscle becoming flabby?

181
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:51,980
-It seems to work all right. I can swim, my arms are strong.

182
00:20:54,230 --> 00:21:04,020
One of the things that happened I think, is that when I had a pregnancy,

183
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:15,950
my rectus muscles sometimes they really split, which I think compromised my abdominal muscles

184
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,450
which compromised my back muscles.

185
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:27,690
At the time when you ligaments are slackering and eventually I had about 12 years ago,

186
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:34,540
a horrible operation to stitch up my back again. Really horrible.

187
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:46,530
-How many years ago, the operation?
-About 15 years ago.

188
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:52,930
-And how long is that this condition with the fibromyalgia?

189
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:55,110
-About 11.

190
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,100
-That means 4 years after the operation.

191
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,610
-I don't think I recovered totally well from that operation.

192
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:13,360
-And after the operation you had some antibiotics?
-No.

193
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,270
-You refused to take?

194
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:20,870
-I didn't need them. You only take antibiotics to bacteria.

195
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,070
-Yes but here they give it after the operation, it is just routine.

196
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:28,880
They give in case you develop.
-Not all doctors do.

197
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:35,130
-There are some wise doctors left over. Very good.

198
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,880
Do you have any constipation, diarrhea?
-No.

199
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:55,530
One thing that happened that is when you begin to make connection is...

200
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:08,560
When I had all tummy fell apart with pregnancies and then I did have trouble with the bowels.

201
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:15,270
When they put the two rectus muscles back together again, my bowel started to

202
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:17,820
work about 4 o 'clock in the morning.

203
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:26,040
I think that's possibly why I wake up at 4 o'clock in the morning.

204
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:30,680
I'm not sure that is because my metabolism changes all the time now.

205
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,690
So I have a lot of that.

206
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:40,690
-Did you pick up weight after a certain period or your weight was always like this?

207
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:50,120
-No, I was very slim. In the last 10 years.

208
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:09,430
-Would you say that you suffer more in a climate which is cold and wet or hot and wet?

209
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:11,690
What is the worse climate for you?

210
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:22,020
-Cold and wet. I like cold, I can tolerate cold, I can tolerate heat, as much as I can

211
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:32,350
tolerate cold but if I get cold and wet here, I cease up and I have a sense of going rusty.

212
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:39,660
That's how I feel. That's what it does to me and I feel very stiff.

213
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:47,370
-How much water do you drink?
-Normal.

214
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:58,620
-Did you have any problems with your glands?
-No.

215
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:02,620
-As a child you were healthy child?

216
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:11,280
-Perhaps with all these things, the scarlet fever, I had.

217
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:23,780
-That's why you are healthy because you had them. Now they don't allow them.

218
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,050
-I had all the exanthemata.

219
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:32,720
-Did you ever have any skin eruption?
-I had eczema as a child.

220
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:37,300
-Where?
-Here.

221
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:44,550
-Back of your knee?
-Mostly all the way up here.

222
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,030
-What age?

223
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:57,130
-From four and I know I had this when I was in secondary school.

224
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:03,280
Perhaps until 15 or 16 and then it just disappeared.

225
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,400
-Do you remember how it went away?

226
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:19,860
-We used to live in Lynch and then we moved back to the seaside and swimming in the sea

227
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:33,440
this would clear up.  Steroid didn't help much but going in the sea I could come out

228
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:37,690
and see that my arm looked nearly healed.

229
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:42,290
-Always the sea was good for you?
-Always.

230
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,310
-Your father is still alive?
-No.

231
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:50,450
-What age he died?
-82.

232
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,440
-From?

233
00:26:55,060 --> 00:27:01,450
-I think that this was his natural life spam and for a year before his death, he just ...

234
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,700
-Went down.

235
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:08,710
-It was his kidneys but it was one thing after the other.

236
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:11,910
I felt that it was his natural life spam.

237
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,280
-What position do you sleep in bed?

238
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:29,380
-I sleep on my back now because it's the only way I'm comfortable.

239
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:58,700
-Your menses did not give you any problems?
-Only very painful.

240
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,610
-In the lower abdomen?

241
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:08,950
-Yes it's like when I had labor pains it was identical to the period pains.

242
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:15,300
-Every month you had a labor.
-Yes, it was quite bad.

243
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:20,600
-After the menopause did you have any flashes?

244
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,550
-Not much.

245
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:34,700
-Your temperature of the body has changed after the menopause?

246
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:45,300
-Not particularly. A little flash is quite pleasant, it wasn't a bad one.

247
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:52,290
I didn't have anything that was particularly unpleasant.

248
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:24,030
-Do you have your luggages now?
-Yes.

249
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:37,360
I could say what I feel about where I am with this pain. I have a chain of results.

250
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:43,270
It was more what I did before I left the train 8 or 10 o'clock from Heathrow

251
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:48,010
that perhaps is important.
-What?

252
00:30:48,110 --> 00:31:02,010
-I packed up my home and put it into a container because my next home is not ready

253
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:13,280
and I think all of this started when I packed up the family home 12 years ago.

254
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:16,280
That's when it started.

255
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:28,890
-When you say you packed, that means you worked yourself quite a lot physically,

256
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,870
to understand that?
-Yes.

257
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:40,920
-And also what you mean is emotionally you were traumatized in a way or in a big way?

258
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,770
-Pretty big.

259
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:50,170
-So it was a traumatic experience plus a physical exertion.

260
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:55,750
That means you had to do a lot of physical work, at the same time feeling sad

261
00:31:55,850 --> 00:32:01,830
because you were leaving your home but you were going to another home

262
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:07,350
that was not as nice as before? Or that is what you thought?

263
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:13,490
-The first time is packing up, what I call my family. The whole thing.

264
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:20,750
-You separated with your husband?
-Yes. So the big family home...

265
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:22,750
-Different.

266
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:36,740
-And I did it all on my own. And this is like a re-run, doing the same thing all over again.

267
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,080
-Now you separated again?

268
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:53,830
-No, this is very good. It's not the same. But it has special qualities.

269
00:32:53,930 --> 00:33:02,830
Now I live on the water. I don't live in a house and it has a special quality to it.

270
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,840
-You live in the water, you mean on a boat?

271
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:11,770
-Yes on a boat. And I'm going from that size boat to that size boat.

272
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:19,600
-The water is salt water?
-No, it's the Thames.

273
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:29,490
-It's a lot of wetness there?

274
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:35,830
-I didn't think is any more wet than anywhere else. Not unless you fall in.

275
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:44,590
-The weather in England is sort of falling into the water.

276
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:55,820
-I often wonder if it has to do with being at the river but I get a lot of relief from the sauna;

277
00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:08,040
it makes me feel like I have been oiled. It's hot, dry heat.

278
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:21,940
-And you separated from your husband because you wanted or

279
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:29,770
because you caught your husband with another woman and this kind of things?

280
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:40,710
-It had become an unhappy relationship and the children had grown up and two had left home.

281
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:47,370
I remember the next thing that happened quite soon was that my parents died.

282
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:57,610
In one year it was a puff... like this. One minute was all and then next minute...

283
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:02,730
-Nothing was left.
-It was a big, big thing.

284
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,950
-Still affects you?
-Yes.

285
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:20,700
And the noise of these crickets reminds me of family holiday in France.

286
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:33,190
The flowers, the whole thing reminds me of all this.

287
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:36,700
-Which were happy times for you?
-Yes.

288
00:35:53,670 --> 00:36:02,120
-Your first husband ...
-I only had one. That's enough.

289
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,760
-With the husband you separated, you do not live together now.

290
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,760
-No.

291
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,760
-Is he alive?
-Yes.

292
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:14,760
-He remarried?
-Yes.

293
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,870
-He has other children?
-No.

294
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:33,110
-Your first husband was a playboy?
-Not at all. An unusual man.

295
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:41,630
-But not going out with women easily.
-No.

296
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:52,210
When I began to study Homeopathy I thought he was like a Lycopodium person,

297
00:36:52,310 --> 00:37:01,870
he was very much a distance person with people and with the children.

298
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:12,250
In a way, since the separation and the divorce I think I've been mother

299
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:17,340
and father for the children, although they have grown up.

300
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:21,870
-He doesn't pay attention?
-Not much.

301
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:26,600
-So not responsibility for him?

302
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:35,100
-I don't see it. Very important is his work.

303
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:56,500
-And you were the type of the person you will not confront him in case he would

304
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:00,680
speak badly to you or you will confront him?

305
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:11,590
-Probably not confront him because if I did, he would just move away.

306
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:15,030
We wouldn't have an argument.

307
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:31,190
-Silence.
-Yes. And a lot of drink.

308
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:39,760
-To release the anger or whatever.

309
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:45,410
-When he was drunk he would hit you, he would do cruel things?

310
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:49,520
-No, he just wasn't there.

311
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:56,770
-Did you ever take Staphysagria?
-No.

312
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:06,350
I thought about it but after reading Catherine Coulter lovely description of indignation  that's it.

313
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:11,480
That's the trouble with studying Homeopathy.

314
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:14,230
-You read a remedy, you find yourself in the remedy.

315
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:24,840
-Yes but you can't do that, ah it's that one. I thought of Staphysagria.

316
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:30,690
I think I go into Staphysagria mood and then I come out of this.

317
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:43,910
-The eczema went away in the sea, not swimming in sweet water?

318
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:53,750
-Definitely by the sea. I was brought up by the sea side and we swam on holidays.

319
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:57,370
It was the Irish sea, it was very cold.

320
00:39:57,470 --> 00:40:00,250
-Not in a river?
-No.

321
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:11,130
-Do you take fruits a lot?
-Yes a lot of fruits.

322
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:16,720
-What fruits do you love most?
-Difficult.

323
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:37,290
Apples, bananas, all of them. Apples is the one but they have to be crisp and sour, not too sweet.

324
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:43,460
-Unripe?
-Not unripe, just nice.

325
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:47,120
-Oranges you like?
-I like oranges.

326
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:53,540
-Sour oranges?
-No, sweet oranges.

327
00:40:55,290 --> 00:41:06,800
-But oranges is not your favorite fruit?
-I would squeeze them and drink the juice.

328
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,050
-OK, thank you.

329
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:46,800
-... with the prescriptions, homeopathic prescriptions. You can be treating a person,

330
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:56,170
3,4,5 years, nothing happens unless of course you find the correct remedy.

331
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:05,400
In this case she said Hepar Sulphur has helped her in a trancheitis condition.

332
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:11,900
And that was the only remedy perhaps that really showed an effect except of Lachesis

333
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,920
which showed a little bit of an effect.

334
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:28,330
The main symptoms that she has are symptoms of?

335
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:36,410
Calc. carbonica.

336
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:46,730
So how is that most of you see Calc. carbonica and the homeopaths who were treating for years

337
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:54,080
they could not see the Calcarea element? How is it possible?

338
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:10,060
Definitely we have a Calc. carbonica which is after a period.

339
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:16,920
Which is the period on which Calc. carbonica starts being appearing?

340
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:22,920
-Going out of home.

341
00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:34,170
-You may have a grief, show me the grief remedies, ailments from grief.

342
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:47,240
Usually when somebody has grief, we don't think of Calc. carbonica.

343
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,310
The last remedy we think is Calc. carbonica.

344
00:43:51,410 --> 00:44:01,660
I say what was the symptom that pointed that now a Calc. carbonica is established?

345
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:12,170
Ailments from grief. You see the Calcarea is there but in small letters.

346
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:23,750
We have Aurum, Ignatia, Natrum muriaticum, Phosphoric acid, Staphysagria, Lachesis,

347
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:29,880
Ambrea grisea, Causticum and then we have the other remedies which are italics

348
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:37,150
and lastly we have the ordinary letters, Calc. carbonica is there.

349
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:43,890
But you see the idea is, she was given Natrum muriaticum so much grief, no effect.

350
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:47,640
She was given Ignatia, so much grief, no effect.

351
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:53,650
She could have said, after a few days, if you have given Ignatia to her and you ask her

352
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:58,630
after a few days she comes back for a consultation and you say, how are you?

353
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:01,640
She will say, I think I'm better.

354
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:08,140
But in the long run after a few months she is the same. Actually there is no change.

355
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,780
The same with Natrum muriaticum. I think I'm better.

356
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:17,630
Better in this, psychologically, this, that, why?

357
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:25,990
Because in her case in spite of being in grief not one of the main remedies is indicated.

358
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:33,480
So therefore if you don't see the symptoms of Natrum muriaticum, putting salt,

359
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:46,240
the symptoms of Ignatia, sighing, you know how you do when you lose your boyfriend.

360
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:54,760
He has lost his girlfriend, he knows. Nobody else knows here, you see.

361
00:45:56,730 --> 00:46:01,740
Therefore you search for general symptoms.

362
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:13,490
My question to you is when, at what time in history, she started being Calcarea carbonica?

363
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:25,150
-After the operation?
-Yes but not because of the operation.

364
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:28,220
If you have an operation, you don't need Calcarea carbonica.

365
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:36,970
-The strain from the physical exertion.

366
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:44,210
-Physical exertion is a symptom of Calcarea carbonica definitely but I don't mean that.

367
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:54,360
-When she became the head of the home in the family, a parent in the family.

368
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:58,720
-No, this is not Calc. carbonica.

369
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:03,960
-When she left her first home from her husband.

370
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:12,960
-I understand she had that grief but because of the grief, she would have other remedies,

371
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:14,700
not Cal. carbonica.

372
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:23,300
What she said that it tells us that this now starts to be a Calcarea carbonica case?

373
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:34,280
-I think she had a hormonal disturbance on the pregnancy.

374
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:46,890
-Like? What hormonal?
-She became more flabby.

375
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:54,470
-Since the recurrent infection.
-No.

376
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:07,720
-When her feet became cold.
-No.

377
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:20,960
-When she started to perspire? Because she was not perspiring before and at the time

378
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:23,950
she started to perspire a lot with exercise.

379
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:26,300
-When did you start perspiring?

380
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:33,950
-Well in my head always but not much. Only more recently.

381
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:39,280
-How recently?
-The last two years.

382
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:44,290
-You perspire the whole body?
-No, I'm just worse on my head.

383
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:50,040
I've always only really perspired on my head with exertion, like playing tennis

384
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:57,290
and so on but more recently it's got much, much worse and at night time.

385
00:48:57,390 --> 00:48:59,780
-At night time you perspire there?
-Yes.

386
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,620
-Since when?
-Many years.

387
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:12,720
-How many?
-Let me think, 10 to 12.

388
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:22,710
-You see there are two things which make the case Calc. carbonica. When she starts

389
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:30,870
putting on weight. She said I was a thin girl. I said, when did you start putting on weight?

390
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:34,620
About 12 years ago she started.

391
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,450
By that time most probably the perspiration has started slowly.

392
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:45,450
So you see putting more weight, more perspiration, worse cold, cold feet,

393
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:54,050
the case is Calcarea carbonica. Now before Calcarea carbonica what was the case?

394
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:01,970
You take a chance.

395
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:06,330
-Medorrhinum?
-Yes.

396
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:12,770
Most probably the second remedy she will need is Medorrhinum.

397
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:21,190
After Calc. carbonica she most probably, we are not sure, she will need a Medorrhinum

398
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:24,940
because of this amelioration by the sea.

399
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:32,440
But now she does not have other symptoms of Medorrhinum to say, first remedy Medorrhinum,

400
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:35,790
then we go to Calc. carbonica.

401
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:47,190
Another thing also you have to remember here, in these groups we have all the remedies.

402
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:53,770
All the remedies can be indicated in each group. There is no group here you say that

403
00:50:56,890 --> 00:51:01,860
the remedy is not indicated. It is indicated only to that group.

404
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:13,540
The same way all kinds of nosological entities can belong to one of these levels,

405
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:16,560
you have cancer, cancer, cancer.

406
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:24,130
The more you go down, the more difficult it is, the more easy to spread the cancer.

407
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:31,130
Here, when you have cancer in these cases, the cancer just explodes, you can not hold it.

408
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:35,320
So to which group she belongs?

409
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:51,050
She belongs to A group, perhaps she has come down because of the acutes,

410
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:58,640
to the third level where frequent acute starts with B level.

411
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:04,290
That means the defenses are going down and then they start frequent acutes.

412
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:07,390
Most probably she's still on A level.

413
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:14,040
On A level, on third here. Most probably she needs Calc. carbonica

414
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:22,890
and then perhaps Medorrhinum but her health in general is quite good.

415
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:36,650
Mentally, emotionally also quite good, in spite of having been through such tremendous grief.

416
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:42,620
As she says, she packed her house, she lived with a man whom she loved and she has to leave

417
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:47,310
and pack and take the children, this is very traumatic experience.

418
00:52:47,810 --> 00:52:54,660
In spite of that, not much has been left, still there is of course,

419
00:52:54,760 --> 00:53:03,050
you can not give the remedy of total forgetfulness.

420
00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:08,050
It would be nice if we had that remedy.

421
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:13,210
Each one would take, forget the past, we live in the now and the future.

422
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:27,670
So she has a good constitution, she needs Calc. carbonica and we are going to give

423
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:46,220
the Calc. carbonica and by the day after tomorrow...

424
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:58,810
Unless it's a rupture, if this is a rupture on the fibers, it's not going to go away

425
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:05,700
but what is going to go away is the general sensitivity.

426
00:54:07,130 --> 00:54:15,670
But if it is really a rupture of fibers, it will take a few months before it goes totally.

427
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:24,460
If it's only a strain, it will fix itself quite fast.

428
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:33,320
I did not give you this case for study because everybody would come back and say this is

429
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:37,880
Calcarea carbonica. It's not a good case for study.

430
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:52,690
-In the repertorisation Arsenicum came close. Is that a possibility?

431
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:55,540
-No.

432
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:06,700
-I have a question.

433
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:19,690
If we had met this lady a couple of years ago, because of the tremendous grief,

434
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:25,780
would it still be Calc. carbonica or might had start with a grief remedy?

435
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:51,940
-I would have given still Calcarea carbonica. The reason is that I don't have enough symptoms

436
00:55:52,040 --> 00:56:01,690
for a grief remedy and I have strong symptoms for a deeper constitutional remedy,

437
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:04,130
which was coming all along.

438
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:16,940
That means in the last grief, which she had, is not changing the symptomatology

439
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:22,110
drastically in order to go to another remedy all together.

440
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:32,820
The basic symptomatology continues. It's this sensitivity, this weakness in the muscular system,

441
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:44,020
the muscular system is quite weak and this we know that Calcarea carbonica is doing

442
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:54,360
and it is a specific remedy. To give a remedy for grief in this case will not do anything.

443
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:17,880
-We can start. Tell me what happened because you had some big reaction.

444
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:30,350
-I think so. One never knows with this Homeopathy. You never know quite where you are.

445
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:33,700
Stick with the medicine.
-Stick with the facts.

446
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:36,850
-I took the medicine and that was very good.

447
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:43,610
I have taken nothing else at all and no coffee and it really was 100%.

448
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:44,550
-Very good girl.

449
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:52,520
-However I have suffered considerably yesterday. Not particularly immediately after the medicine

450
00:57:52,620 --> 00:58:03,210
but the next day I knew I didn't feel right. I felt awful, no energy, ill inside.

451
00:58:05,450 --> 00:58:17,030
But I came up to the Center and I thought I was going to faint so I rang for the lady

452
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:22,770
in the hotel who has been so kind and she came and rescued me and I went home.

453
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:25,580
And I laid on bed and just collapsed.

454
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:34,110
With the most extreme exhaustion I think I've ever experienced in my life.

455
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:43,110
The medicine gave me permission to do this perhaps.

456
00:58:44,610 --> 00:58:49,260
-What else? Some other things are happening?

457
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:56,030
-I had terrible headache. One of my very serious headaches but I just laid

458
00:58:56,130 --> 00:59:08,100
and stopped a bit and slept. All I wanted is a little fruit and to drink .

459
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:11,920
-You said excruciating pain?

460
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:17,670
-Yes I get headaches, very bad quite frequently, not infrequently

461
00:59:17,770 --> 00:59:22,170
and this was one of my headaches. It doesn't really bother me.

462
00:59:22,270 --> 00:59:25,420
-But somebody was telling me that you are crying.

463
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:33,990
-I had this desire to cry; what I felt pretty choked, the whole week I felt choked.

464
00:59:34,090 --> 00:59:38,500
-But did you cry?
-Only a bit.

465
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:44,760
I really wanted to have what I would call a good cry but my head was so painful,

466
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:51,270
I couldn't bear the thought of it. It's a pity.

467
00:59:51,770 --> 00:59:55,420
-So crying would make your headache much worse?

468
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,910
-Yes and speaking.

469
00:59:58,010 --> 01:00:03,740
-You held yourself back not to cry. You don't allow yourself...

470
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:09,260
-Yes, I've got enough suffering. I felt like having a good cry when yesterday

471
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:17,000
and when I left here the day before, I wanted just to cry and cry and cry.

472
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:21,750
-Why you did not cry? Because of the headache?
-Yes.

473
01:00:21,850 --> 01:00:31,370
And because of people, because it upsets people and the lady at the hotel is sweet

474
01:00:31,470 --> 01:00:37,970
but she is a bit mystified of what's the matter with me. I don't want to explain.

475
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:44,700
-How are you today?
-I feel better today.

476
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:55,050
I feel, not full of energy, but a bit better but far from well.

477
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:08,700
This pain is the same and I'm sure it's a tear It feels like I had an operation yesterday

478
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:13,040
and every step is like this.

479
01:01:13,550 --> 01:01:25,210
That's very tiring, it takes my energy and very worrying and if I'm honest I'm anxious

480
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:31,450
that it isn't an acute onset of the family disease, which is arthritic hips.

481
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:36,950
I don't think it is but I fear and I should have to go and have it addressed when I get back

482
01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:39,550
because I think it's silly, not to.

483
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:49,950
-You should be checking the degree of osteoporosis in your bones.

484
01:01:50,050 --> 01:01:51,950
-I might be.

485
01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:55,530
-You will have to be checking when you are back.

486
01:01:55,630 --> 01:02:01,280
-I'm not osteoporotic person. I think it's the joints.

487
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:13,300
-Calcarea carbonica maybe but psychologically you feel good today?

488
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:21,890
-No. The week has been very difficult for me.

489
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,280
-I'm talking about today.

490
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:30,860
-Today I feel better than yesterday. I feel better sitting here talking to you.

491
01:02:31,310 --> 01:02:37,680
Over all I feel a sense of failure being here and walking around with the stick.

492
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:43,090
I feel somewhere humiliated and not at all myself.

493
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:52,840
-But this is not your fault, if you did some exercises and there are some tears,

494
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:58,460
anybody could have an accident, it's not to be feeling like that.

495
01:03:01,030 --> 01:03:07,180
How was your sleep last night?
-Not bad.

496
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:14,430
Two hours at the time and then wake up, two hours at the time and a lot of heat.

497
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:16,350
-Did you perspire last night?

498
01:03:16,450 --> 01:03:24,590
-Finally there is something I remembered. I perspire tremendously up about midnight and

499
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:36,760
then not after that. Yesterday while I was resting, I was pouring with perspiration on my face.

500
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:37,760
-The whole night?

501
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:46,360
-No, just the beginning of the night. And a lot today but then again it' s hot.

502
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:50,590
-Do you feel more the heat today than other days?

503
01:03:50,690 --> 01:03:52,530
-No.

504
01:03:54,280 --> 01:04:00,440
-This kind of heat is bothering you or it is tolerable?

505
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:07,430
-No, it's all right providing you don't have to do anything. If you had to work,

506
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:18,520
if I had to get dressed properly, put my proper clothes on, I would find it very uncomfortable.

507
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:22,680
-What about this sensitivity on the buttocks? How is today?

508
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:31,170
-Not so bad. Up until the last two days I've taken an anti-inflammatory and I stopped.

509
01:04:31,270 --> 01:04:36,340
I haven't taken any for two days and this is not bad at all.

510
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:39,900
In fact I've been lying on my side.

511
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:45,780
In fact I've got a preference tonight on my side and as the mattress is considerably hard,

512
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:48,830
comparing with the one I have at home, it's not bad.

513
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,130
-Very good, thank you very much.

514
01:04:56,140 --> 01:05:02,280
-What I wanted to ask you George, is it all right to take any anti-inflammatory or not at all?

515
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:11,700
-Nothing. Don't touch coffee, no pain killers, nothing.

516
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:15,280
-Do I repeat the medicine at any time?

517
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:20,530
-Only in case you feel a relapse is coming.

518
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:26,030
That means you will check it by the sensitivity on your buttocks and by...

519
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:30,030
You see the perspiration will stop eventually.

520
01:05:30,130 --> 01:05:39,780
After you go back to England you will have no perspiration and then the sensitivity

521
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:42,030
also will subside.

522
01:05:42,130 --> 01:05:51,530
As long as the sensitivity is within limits, that means 20%-30% has remained, don't take.

523
01:05:51,630 --> 01:05:57,870
If the sensitivity goes over 85-90%, then you can repeat.

524
01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:07,270
-It doesn't come if I do everything correct. If I was to walk up here would be in agony...

525
01:06:07,370 --> 01:06:13,280
-You try for a while not to exert yourself, let us say for two weeks.

526
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:16,030
After that you can exert as much as you like.

527
01:06:16,130 --> 01:06:25,780
-So minimal exertion for two weeks and no medicine. Right, you are on.

528
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:26,620
-Very good.
