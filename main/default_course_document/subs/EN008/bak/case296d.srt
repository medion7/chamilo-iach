1
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,280
-And you told me to continue in this way, every time I needed

2
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,130
I should repeat Phosphorus.

3
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,490
When I returned to Berlin the first days I took Phosphorus regularly

4
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:45,230
on a daily basis, so that I had the feeling I'm not really in my full strength

5
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:50,530
and Phosphorus helped me to gain my strength.

6
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:58,530
For the first 3-4 weeks I woke up very early between 4-5 a.m. and it was really fresh

7
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:04,880
and relaxed but then I walked through my apartment and kept talking to myself.

8
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,880
I talked with myself wandering around in the apartment.

9
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:16,030
And many odd things came up, the main issue was that I had difficulties in saying

10
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:21,960
what I need or what I want and that I can't say no, I can't refuse anything.

11
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,860
The more I did this the more I had the feeling that from now on people you gonna have

12
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,460
to count on me, I'm going to show myself.

13
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:38,840
Then I changed my behavior and dared to say no a couple of times and it was really amazing

14
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:44,840
how much rejoice came up on me, how much strength I got out of it

15
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,040
and see how different I could react.

16
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:59,430
I took Phosphorus all the way up to LM15, every time I realized that the lower potency

17
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:05,670
is not acting anymore, I went up one potency higher and also during this time I noticed

18
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,930
that I hardly every had to drink black tea.

19
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:14,590
I have a low blood pressure and during this time with Phosphorus, I was hardly ever needed

20
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,840
to drink black tea. Then everything reduced again.

21
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:23,510
I noticed I need more black tea, I noticed Phosphorus isn't acting very well anymore

22
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,110
and things came back.

23
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:32,760
According to my feeling that would be the time to take a high potency but I decided to wait

24
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:37,010
because it was only 8 weeks until I would come back here for the course and I knew I was going

25
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:42,270
to have a follow up, so I thought OK I can hold these 8 weeks and wait to see what happens.

26
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:51,930
Another thing on the emotional level, I don't have enough self-confidence.

27
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:55,680
People when looking at me from the outside will never realize that but it's true

28
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:01,420
and also when I'm doing my practice I, myself, always have the feeling I don't know enough,

29
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:09,180
although according to the feedback I get, I do know enough but I always have the feeling

30
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,480
I'm not good enough.

31
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:16,830
Also we had this issue this morning with Hanna already, in my entire life I never let

32
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:23,930
my anger come out, I never yelled at anybody or showed my anger, it never came out.

33
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,180
Now I'd like to give you some physical symptoms I have.

34
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:37,830
What I still have is that if I jump or if I run, my bladder still is incontinent

35
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:44,110
but I still like to jump very much. For example if I see some place where I can climb up

36
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:47,460
and jump from there, I really enjoy doing it and do it often.

37
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:55,830
What came back is the Chlamydia I had, I was in the gynecologist and he did an examination

38
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,680
and there they came back but they are not in the blood.

39
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:04,830
When she diagnosed that, I also felt that again I have pains in my finger joints

40
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:10,580
and in my toe joints and these pains lasted until 3 weeks ago.

41
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,720
Since then they are gone but I didn't have any time to go to the gynecologist

42
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,320
and have another check.

43
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,270
-When she says the Chlamydia came back, she means a kind of leucorrhea?

44
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:40,640
-No, I have no leucorrhea whatsoever. I once told you that I use to have Chlamydia

45
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:46,640
they were diagnosed and it was treated with antibiotics, after which they disappeared and

46
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,440
now they returned.

47
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:10,650
-I don't remember this. What exactly was the original situation?

48
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,050
-That was at the time when I took Phosphorus 10M, I went to see my gynecologist,

49
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:32,840
just to have a regular check up, as I do and during this check up he diagnosed Chlamydia

50
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:39,840
and you had said, when I reported that to you that it's possible that maybe I had them some time

51
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,890
in the past and that the symptom was reappearing.

52
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:51,150
At that time, when I took Phosphorus 10M, I did not had a partner, so there was actually

53
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,740
no intercourse, no place where I could had contracted it.

54
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:02,720
-But that was with the original Phosphorus?
-Yes.

55
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,570
-And then disappeared and then they came back again?

56
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:23,470
-At that time they did not go away, I waited for 1 year and then I took antibiotics after which

57
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:27,470
they disappeared and I have reported this in May, when I was here.

58
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:34,230
-Yes, when she had the relapse and she was not feeling so well and then she started again

59
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:41,570
with Phosphorus.
-Exactly and now the Chlamydia came back.

60
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:53,070
My stool is formed partially but more of it is soft.

61
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:04,470
After Phosphorus for a couple of weeks I always had the sensation, as if somebody very tenderly

62
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:11,740
touching my liver and my gallbladder, not strong, it was just a very tender touch and the stool

63
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,730
always looked as if a lot of bile was coming out with it and I always felt well after it,

64
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,820
I always had the feeling of getting rid of something through it.

65
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:30,570
-She feels good now after stool? What do you mean?

66
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:36,970
-No, it was just at that time that I had the feeling that my gallbladder is emptying and that

67
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:42,220
my body is getting rid of it with the stool and it was a good feeling, as if the body was

68
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,820
getting rid of something old.

69
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,570
-During that time.

70
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:54,720
-My first menstruation after Phosphorus was very strong and I also felt very well with that.

71
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,070
I had a good flow.

72
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,320
-Now she continues to have a lot of blood in the menstruation.

73
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:13,470
-No, it's not very much blood at all, only in the first day and the next days is not a lot at all

74
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:21,990
but I have a premenstrual syndrome; the day of my ovulation I start having pains in my joints

75
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:28,720
similar with some kind of rheumatism and it lasts until the second day of menstruation

76
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,220
and then it ends.

77
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,570
The only thing which ameliorates me during this time is hot bath.

78
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:43,140
This bothers me a lot because it inhibits me in my emotions, in my activity.

79
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:48,810
I'm a person who likes to move a lot but when I have this I cant' move very well, it's like

80
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:55,650
I have stiff joints and I can't move the way I like to.

81
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:01,900
I'm still sensitive to cold and very easily chilly.

82
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:11,400
-As much as before or less? She used to have ice cold feet.

83
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:22,220
-It's a bit less and people ask me but you don't wear so much clothing, it's hard to believe

84
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,900
but I just don't like to wear many things.

85
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:35,750
When I'm cold my fingers turn white and numb. What has got a lot better is my strength.

86
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:41,970
I can swim in deep water now, I can swim long distances and I do it every day and I really enjoy it,

87
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,900
it's a lot of fun.

88
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:50,890
Right now I need a lot of sleep still, I really need to take a nap in the afternoon and

89
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:58,420
usually is in such a way that I lie down, mostly on my abdomen, for 1-2 hours I just remain

90
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:03,390
exactly the way I lied down and have a very deep sleep without moving.

91
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:07,240
Also at night I have long and deep sleep and don't wake up.

92
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,600
Every once in a while I feel the pressure on my thyroid, if you remember I had an operation

93
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:21,900
on my thyroid, years ago because I had a cold nod but the thyroid values are OK.

94
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:35,020
What I noticed, I very rarely eat meat but what I like a lot is cartilage, especially from the bones

95
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,520
of chicken, the pieces that other people would throw away, I really enjoy eating that

96
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:55,450
and I want to say that my nails have corrugated.

97
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:08,600
I still have my psoriasis but it did not get any worse, I still have in my belly button,

98
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:14,050
behind my ear and for a while I had it below both eyes but it's got a lot better here

99
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,700
due to the sun.

100
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:23,360
One week before we came here I twisted my ankle and after a couple of hours the pain got so intense

101
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:30,690
that I could not walk on it anymore and then I took Arnica in a C200

102
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:34,690
and Hypericum in a C30 alternating, for 5 hours all together.

103
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,940
Then on the next day everything was fine.

104
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:45,070
Here on the island I have several mosquito bites which were quite swollen

105
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:47,920
and I put some Apis cream on them.

106
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:57,070
During the time I was taking Phosphorus on different LM potencies, I had pains in my sinuses

107
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:04,320
and I always had a constant dripping of mucus down the back of my throat and my throat was

108
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:10,420
a bit red but there was no real inflammation. It was just a subacute state of it.

109
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:18,320
I don't like to stay in the sun for a longer period of time, I enjoy it but I can't stay any long

110
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:23,570
because I develop a strong inner restlessness and my whole temperature in my body turns

111
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:27,260
upside down and then I really have to get out of the sun.

112
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:38,660
-I want to ask some questions. The first symptoms that she has given was a pressing pain in the heart

113
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:45,090
and a very superficial respiration. How is that?

114
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:53,740
-It's gone, at that time it was an acute situation. It still comes back every now and then

115
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,090
if I'm very excited.

116
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,840
-Also she had nausea.

117
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:06,090
-When I'm excited I quickly react with nausea.

118
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:18,240
-She also reported of being very sympathetic, is still there this element as much as before

119
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,670
and the anxiety for others?

120
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:29,820
-Yes, this has still remained the same. The only difference is that now from my mind I try

121
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,070
to hold back a little bit more.

122
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:35,660
For example when I came to the island one of the very first days, I walked

123
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:41,320
and passed a house and inside woman was crying and sobbing really strong.

124
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:47,050
For me it was very difficult to just walk by the house and to get my mind out of it.

125
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,650
For hours I was still thinking about this incident.

126
00:13:54,400 --> 00:14:05,650
-Also in the first interview she was quite depressed and she had thoughts of suicide...

127
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:13,800
-I've been in therapy since then, in several different ones and took a long while for me to get out

128
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,400
of that depression but therapy has helped me.

129
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,980
-What kind of therapy? Psychotherapy?

130
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:27,720
-Yes and the last kind of therapy I did was something where I went into trans

131
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:42,470
and looked at all my beliefs, my structures and I looked in there and told anything I found.

132
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:46,470
My therapist was noting everything down and afterwards we looked at it together.

133
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:50,250
It was very interesting for me to find out what was inside me.

134
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,830
-When it was that in time?

135
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:04,820
-The last phase was shortly before I came here, in the island.

136
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,020
-What about the aversion to eggs she had?

137
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:25,260
-I haven't eaten any since. Every now and then I think you might eat one now and if I would eat,

138
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,270
it would be soft boiled but I still can not imagine eating them.

139
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:39,660
-And salt?
-I take more salt definitely.

140
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:44,880
I remember that I hardly put any spice on my food but that already changed after the first dose

141
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:50,010
of Phosphorus that I started putting more spices on and now I like salt very much.

142
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:56,160
-How is her thirst now?
-Very strong still.

143
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,660
-Cold?

144
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:05,660
-Here I drink cold drinks but home in Berlin I like warm, I make a big pot of tea and I drink this tea

145
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,760
during the entire day, it just cools off during the day.

146
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:15,010
-Does she have any fear of thunderstorms, of the dark?

147
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,260
-No.

148
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:36,600
-Also she was complaining that she felt she is not appreciated very much.

149
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:43,200
-I don't know if it's solved but I feel a lot better with this issue. I have a lot more self confidence

150
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:47,660
and if I'm in my strength, its' not really a big problem for me.

151
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,260
Only if I feel weak, then it starts to be a big problem.

152
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:58,010
-How much is her blood pressure now?
-It's mostly 95 over 55.

153
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:07,410
-Still is low?
-Still low even if I drink a lot of black tea.

154
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:16,260
-But before it was lower?
-No, it wasn't any lower.

155
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:25,660
-But I thought she said, she doesn't need to drink the tea and she has more high blood pressure,

156
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,260
in the beginning. Is that what she said?

157
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:41,160
-Yes, during the time with Phosphorus it was so, the blood pressure was higher around 110 to 60

158
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:46,430
and then I didn't drink the black tea but afterwards when the Phosphorus stopped acting and I felt

159
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:53,760
I would need a high potency, the blood pressure went down again and I needed more the black tea.

160
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:35,720
In this case again we have the question whether she is still in the Phosphorus state or

161
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,080
we must change the remedy.

162
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:51,730
Phosphorus definitely has helped her, mostly because, who can say?

163
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:15,380
How do we know? There are certain things that you have to be aware, immediately as you hear them

164
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,230
you know what is going on with the patient.

165
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:28,720
The reason why I say it is acted it is because both times when a high potency was given

166
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:41,970
and also low potency, both times brought back the Chlamydia, brought back a suppressed situation

167
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:48,820
which is affecting very much cases like this.

168
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:55,820
Especially the Phosphorus cases are tipped over quite easily.

169
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:07,970
It is a sensitive micro element which seems to be disturbed very easily.

170
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:16,220
Therefore, if you give a remedy and brings back a discharge, that remedy is correct.

171
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,420
It doesn't matter what the patient will say.

172
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:27,130
You stick with this remedy. Both times she says it happened the same thing.

173
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:40,880
But yet you can see she is better in general but now she is in a kind of a relapse.

174
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:47,080
She knows more or less the relapse. Is she still in the state of Phosphorus, yes or no?

175
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:05,570
Do we have any change in her symptomatology? This is the first thing you ask.

176
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:14,170
If the general symptomatology, yes we have one, what is this change?

177
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:21,320
The change is that from aversion salt, she now has desire salt.

178
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:36,560
Then you are asking, is this change pointing to another direction?

179
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:52,220
Why? Because Phosphorus is one of the main remedies that they really need the salt.

180
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:59,620
So therefore in spite of the fact there is one change, that change falls within the range

181
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:06,230
of Phosphorus and you don't change the remedy. It's as simple as that.

182
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:19,130
Here we investigate the cases quite thoroughly, so we make as little mistakes as possible.

183
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:25,480
Homeopathy can not be practiced on a mass production level.

184
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:36,870
You have to take care every time because you are battling not with the symptoms, you are battling

185
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:47,640
with forces which suppress life, which are coming from different departments.

186
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:58,790
It's the pollution, it is the stress of life, it is the every day clashes, interpersonal clashes.

187
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:11,540
It's a lot of things which can over turn an organism, a lot. And you are watching all this

188
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:24,640
play between life, which is the organism going on, and death which is this pollution and the stresses.

189
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:35,030
There is a battle so always to keep the organism in a state where it can face all these pollutions,

190
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:44,530
internal and external. That is why it's so difficult, it's not a matter you have a pain,

191
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:53,550
take a pain killer, you have an inflammation, you just give an anti-inflammatory drug.

192
00:23:54,550 --> 00:24:03,220
You see how much difficulty we have in keeping up the balance of a person and how easily

193
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,550
is that balance over turned?

194
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:25,610
What is the potency? Now since she has gone in the low potency LM and seems to be affecting

195
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:33,370
the case, then we have to keep on going higher and higher and every time she can go higher,

196
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:36,960
in case she feels a relapse.

197
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:46,890
These are cases that go like this and then at a certain moment you lose these cases and

198
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:54,140
then you see them after 10-15 years, they are quite well, they stay well.

199
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,650
Oh you remember me? No, I don't remember you, who are you?

200
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:07,250
You gave me this, you have treated this person for 1-2 years and then he remains well.

201
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,690
It's the beauty of Homeopathy.

202
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:26,160
Question? You have 5 minutes to ask a question.

203
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:35,300
-I didn't understand the potency.
-8LM she takes now.

204
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:52,300
-No, she went up to LM15 at home, as far as I understood. She raised up her potency

205
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:59,150
from LM8 to LM 15 by herself.
-Now 16.

206
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:05,050
-Although she thinks the LM potencies don't work any longer, she needs a high potency?

207
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:12,300
-No she thinks that the last potency which she took, it exhausted its action.

208
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:21,400
Now she will go higher. What is higher? Between 15 and higher is 16.

209
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:31,660
-She said that she has got the feeling that LM potencies don't work all together anymore.

210
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:59,550
-Where is she? Who understood what I understood?

211
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:17,280
I understood that the last remedy she took LM15 has exhausted its action,

212
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:22,630
this is what I understood, is this correct?
-Yes.

213
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:31,640
-OK. Now another question, did you say that LM potencies do not work anymore?

214
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,070
You said that?

215
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:39,570
-In the beginning they had an effect and then I had to give higher and higher and then

216
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,380
they didn't work anymore.

217
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:52,030
-The last remedy which you took did not work, the LM15 or it worked for 1-2 weeks?

218
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:57,630
-I had this impression that something worked but after now this was gone.

219
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:09,380
-Then you will go higher like 16,17,18 and if necessary you can take one every day.

220
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:17,200
You take every day, 15. If it acts for one day, then next day you take it again

221
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:23,820
until it doesn't act. You go one higher than the last one that you took.

222
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:29,780
-I had the impression that with LM8 and 9 they really worked the whole day

223
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,380
and this was not the same with LM15.

224
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:44,630
-LM8 was better than 15.

225
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:50,030
-She, herself went back to 8 but she felt it didn't work.

226
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:56,880
She took it in her mouth and she felt wasn't the same reaction as before when she took the 8.

227
00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:02,020
-The main thing is that the remedy has been potentized properly

228
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:07,370
because Phosphorus is spoiled in the potencies, is spoiled easily.

229
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:15,510
So you have to make sure that the remedy is really acting.

230
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:26,360
Therefore what you can do is try a C30 from the pharmacy and then use this instead of LM.

231
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:50,760
-How long would you expect the Chlamydia infection to last? I think it's a bit dangerous

232
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:55,690
if it lasts so much time it can lead to dramatic pains and so on.

233
00:29:56,690 --> 00:30:04,690
-It's more dangerous when you suppress it. I don't know.

234
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:14,340
First of all we have to wait and to give the remedy which is indicated, that's the number 1.

235
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:18,840
As long as Phosphorus is indicated, she will repeat.

236
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:30,860
If the Chlamydia now become more and more, then most probably the remedy may change,

237
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:41,760
in which case we will see but I can not say how long may last this situation.

238
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:55,760
She spoiled the action of the remedy. Once it was given the 1M or 10M whatever we gave

239
00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:01,260
in the beginning, she spoiled the action by taking all these antibiotics of course in order

240
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:12,610
to suppress the Chlamydia which came back and now we try to go more slowly to see what happens.

241
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:25,850
If it doesn't work, then we go higher and higher until we reach 10M or 50M whatever.

242
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:39,500
-Last time did you receive a remedy?

243
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:51,130
-I was recommended to continue to take Phosphorus Q8.

244
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,110
-What happened?

245
00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:04,880
-First of all before I start with my story I want to tell that I feel great, I feel excellent,

246
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:11,330
I have a lot more of self-confidence. Many people approached me here during the course and

247
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:19,680
said that I had changed so much concerning the atmosphere that is around me, that me myself I

248
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:23,020
already recognized it about 7 months ago.

249
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:34,920
-So the interview is over. I don't need anything else. Does she still continue to take the

250
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:38,550
Phosphorus or did she stop?

251
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:53,060
-I had Chlamydia already for 1,5 years and the last time that I was here for the follow up

252
00:32:53,160 --> 00:33:01,440
and I too had these pains in my hands and in my joints, my bones and I had the impression

253
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:07,200
Phosphorus doesn't help me anymore because as I always realized immediately that Phosphorus

254
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:11,790
was doing something for me, I realized that it has no effect for me anymore;

255
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:22,970
so I took Sepia in a Q8 for 14 days and then I spoke again with another homeopath

256
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:35,740
because I still had these burning pain with urination and I had this grief.

257
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:43,440
I was feeling sad but I couldn't cry and during the talking with this homeopath, he said

258
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:54,960
you still talk about this old grief which you can't dissolve and then I got Nat. mur. 10M

259
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:02,790
and then I had a very severe aggravation of my psoriasis.

260
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:19,020
That was going on for 12 weeks and that was very bad, I mostly had it in my anal region

261
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,620
and in my groins.

262
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:34,270
I couldn't walk anymore, I was just handling the whole thing with ice cubes day and night,

263
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:46,100
it was really horrible and at night too I would scratch, it was open,

264
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,290
they were fissures everywhere.

265
00:34:52,800 --> 00:35:05,440
-When this was happening?
-After Nat. mur 14 days later.

266
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:14,540
-I understand that but when it was?
-November, December and January.

267
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:18,540
-From Sepia was any reaction?

268
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:30,290
-A lot of dreams which I would say I can't connect them to my being female.

269
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:38,520
-Nothing else.
-No.

270
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:46,120
-The psoriasis was there before Nat. mur. and to what extend?

271
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:57,620
-I have it since I'm 17 and before taking Nat. mur. I had it in navel and

272
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,370
small spots over my head.

273
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:11,120
-I see. She can continue. Then she had these fissures...

274
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:15,650
-I couldn't tolerate them anymore, I couldn't endure it anymore after these weeks.

275
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:39,750
I couldn't work either. So I took Sulphur Q5 and I took it for 6,7 weeks and gradually went away.

276
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:46,490
On the emotional side, things were not quite settled. I was still having problems with my parents

277
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:55,580
and problems with my divorced husband, divorced for 5 years, I couldn't really handle this.

278
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:03,740
I felt really guilty still and then the psoriasis was so bad and I had to lie in bed for weeks,

279
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:10,980
I was really dealing with this subject. I was really going into it again and I feel very free now,

280
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,170
very deliberate.

281
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:24,500
-For how long she took the Sulphur?
-For 6 weeks.

282
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:34,230
-But now she feels quite well.
-Yes.

283
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:37,070
Another thing is I took another remedy.

284
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:46,070
I moved to NY and I was putting things in order in the house and suddenly I found a nest of mice,

285
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:54,450
little mouse and they built a nest.

286
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:12,320
Nothing was in it but I had the anticipation that definitely has to be something.

287
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:19,570
It must be the mouse and I was under tension and suddenly this mouse was right across the room

288
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:25,070
and I don't know how I jumped onto the bed, which was really physical exercise,

289
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:32,900
I don't know how I managed this because I needed a lot of energy and I was screaming right

290
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:40,650
from my abdomen, it wouldn't come from up here, it was really coming from down and

291
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:51,400
everybody being in the house was frightened and I was all white, I felt nauseated, I was trembling

292
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:55,900
all over and then immediately I run into the bathroom because I didn't know do I have to

293
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:02,150
vomit first or go to diarrhea first. Nothing would come out but I was just sitting

294
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:05,340
on the toilet and I was just trembling over.

295
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:12,890
All day long I was in a shock, I was wearing boots up to here and then a symptom came up that

296
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:18,240
I know but I had completely forgotten about it and that is the feeling of being attacked.

297
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:25,390
And it flashes through my head about 10 times the day but it's just in my head.

298
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:31,070
I'm sitting on the toilet and suddenly I have the impression I've been stamped from behind.

299
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:37,970
It's just an idea and has no connection to reality. Maybe I'm sitting there and suddenly I see

300
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:47,510
a shadow and I would startle and after being in that shock at the evening I got Opium 10M

301
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:52,600
and immediately afterwards I could breathe again and got calmer.

302
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:59,470
I have the impression I would have never guess needs to be Opium in my case

303
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,070
but it really helped me a lot.

304
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:11,810
-Very good. Now how is the psoriasis.

305
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:26,430
-It never really went away totally. I still have it, mostly in the anal region but I can manage.

306
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,140
-Do you remember the remedies that you took before the treatment?

307
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:11,840
-No. I was seeing another homeopath and he gave me Calc. carb. and that didn't do anything,

308
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:27,460
Tuberculinum, Silica and Carcinosin. Carc. was the only remedy that I had the impression that

309
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,340
some action was following.

310
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,810
-Nat. mur. she had not taken before?

311
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:50,310
-I once took it in a C200 but then I wasn't very much affected.

312
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:56,480
-What about Sepia before?
-No.

313
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:05,820
-So Calc., Silica, Nat. mur. had no effect. Carc. had an effect before, correct?

314
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,620
-Yes.

315
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:31,520
-My evaluation is that Sepia did nothing. Nat. mur. acted very well because of this aggravation,

316
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:40,870
it was good and I don't know Sulphur maybe also has acted good.

317
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:53,520
About Opium maybe but at this moment as she said from the beginning she does not need to take

318
00:42:53,620 --> 00:43:00,370
any remedy because she can continue like this. How are her fears?

319
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:06,620
-Which fear? This fear of being attacked?
-Yes.

320
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:12,910
-They got less but still I'm a sort of an anxious type, I get frightened easily.

321
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,120
I think all together I'm just a cautious person.

322
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:31,120
-The feeling of fainting?
-No, I don't have this.

323
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:42,120
-Nausea in the stomach?
-I would have this as a child for years.

324
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:49,860
-I forgot to ask her, she had taken before, Ignatia?
-Yes, I think so.

325
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:04,040
I think I took it in a C200, I'm not sure.

326
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:13,290
-Yes because the first thing she was telling it was the respiration very superficial.

327
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:26,290
Do you remember and difficult breathing?
-Yes.

328
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:34,290
-She had an anxiety during the night.

329
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:40,540
-True as a child, every night I would wake up screaming.

330
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,790
-Still she has it.

331
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:51,110
-No, I used to have it as a grown up too. Every 3 months I would wake up at night with a nightmare

332
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:55,710
and I would lie in my bed not daring to move like nailed down.

333
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:07,290
-I know but now she has that at all?
-No, it hasn't been there for a long time.

334
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:11,790
-The clairvoyance aspect?

335
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:17,940
_There are moments that I have it, I can't make it, it happens to me.

336
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:25,290
-But before she had it all the time?
-More yes.

337
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:43,290
-And the icy coldness of feet?
-Yes at night and hands. I always had cold hands.

338
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:52,710
-She did not think of suicide again because she was thinking a lot of this?

339
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,790
-God thanks, no more.

340
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:13,180
-And she mentioned this fear of being killed, of being murdered, that fear now she says

341
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,030
is still there but it's less.
-Yes.

342
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:18,530
-Very good.

343
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,780
-I would like to say something in the end.

344
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:40,530
I would really thank you very much for the treatment and I think thank you is just not enough.

345
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:47,190
When I started here I was really in a deep depression and I thought nothing

346
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:53,530
could have helped me and I'm so thankful that I got help, that Homeopathy helped me

347
00:46:54,280 --> 00:47:00,530
and this four years here contributed incredibly much to my personal development.

348
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:03,030
Thank you very much.
