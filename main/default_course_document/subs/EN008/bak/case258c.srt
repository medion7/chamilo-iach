1
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,420
-You got Phosphorus.

2
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:37,540
-30C on 24th of June at 02:00 o'clock in the morning after I came home.

3
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,300
-1996, 15 months ago.

4
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,780
-I had quite a lot of aggravations during the next weeks.

5
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:08,040
-For how long all together was the aggravation period, 3 weeks?

6
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,540
-Till beginning of August.

7
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:34,100
-Actually 5 weeks different aggravations. Can you mentioned some of them?

8
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,600
-The first thing was I was very confused. I couldn't even find my keys that I put it in a

9
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,100
certain place, it took me 2 days to find them and I looked there.

10
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:52,500
And I had urine in my blood the next day.

11
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,080
-You had blood in urine.

12
00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:03,730
-Yes, I was very tired, I had stomach ache, gas, constipation, which is funny. I couldn't

13
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:10,650
hold myself awake till 6 o'clock in the evening, I actually fall asleep. For 2 days I slept

14
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:16,400
most of the day. I had to go to work but immediately as I came I went to sleep which

15
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:24,250
normally I'm awake until 2 o'clock in the morning, I was so tired.

16
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:33,990
Very confused, I felt very bad like nauseated like in a pregnancy, headaches,

17
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:47,480
constipation, gas like big stomach, it was like blocked. Mainly tired, no appetite, dizzy.

18
00:02:47,580 --> 00:03:00,990
I didn't get my period for 2 months. When I was here in June I had it on the 14th of June

19
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:11,440
and it didn't come, while it was the seminar and then I didn't have until the first of July.

20
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:19,950
I had a pain in the neck, a pain that comes from the hip, I woke up in the morning, it was

21
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:26,450
a pain from the hip up to the neck into the head. It was exactly the same pain as I had

22
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:33,700
4 years ago when I had Whiplash and I suffered for a month and a half till I had bioenergy

23
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:42,210
treatment and I got rid of it for 4 years. That was the first time it came again but it took

24
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:55,050
1 day and it went. It's gone when I took a pain killer. It was so severe.

25
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:05,300
-What pain killer you took, aspirin?

26
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:21,800
-Maybe aspirin or... or Ibrufen,  one of them. It was for 3 days and then I took a pain killer.

27
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:30,950
After I got the period I lost 2 kilos, I was so bloated and on the middle of July was the

28
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:39,450
first time that I managed to sleep in the afternoon without having a nausea. For me it was

29
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:44,720
beautiful because since I was a child I couldn't sleep in the afternoon without having it.

30
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:53,120
Then something else started, in the middle of July was one of the biggest aggravations

31
00:04:53,220 --> 00:05:02,950
I had, it was pain in the jaws, up right side, top and bottom one but it's not a certain tooth

32
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:15,450
that hurts, it's both of them, half the face. It was more the jaws, underneath the tooth

33
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:22,200
like rheumatic, like toothache, very strong which took quite a long time. It came and go,

34
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,450
came and go for about 2 weeks.

35
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:35,200
Together with this it was at 8.30 in the evening when I was in the middle of a dinner

36
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:41,700
it was my in-laws my daughter supposed to get married and then an hour after the tooth

37
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:47,950
pain started the pain in the chest. It was in the left side, like I used to have in the right

38
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:58,040
side. It was in the left side and very strong and the tooth together and then at 10 o'clock

39
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:04,540
I went home, it was so severe that I took a painkiller, then it reduced. In the morning it

40
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:12,790
continued and at noon the next day, it moved to the right. Stops in the left, starts in the

41
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:18,540
right and stays there for 3 days, again like it used to be before.

42
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,340
Funny enough I spoke with somebody in the bus, she asked me about the atelectasis

43
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,680
that I used to have when I was 11 and she asked where it was and

44
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:35,280
then I remembered it's the same place, the same pain, the same cut, it was like a knife.

45
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:40,280
And now when I think about it, it's the same thing.

46
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:51,930
Anyway the pain was by movement, when I sleep I couldn't move a cm, even not thinking

47
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:59,930
about moving. It was so severe and it unabled me to stand up, to move, to function.

48
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:07,810
Normally it took 3 days. Till then I used to have it only after flights, maybe after exhaustion.

49
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:16,650
After that it started a few more times during the period, till now. I had it in August,

50
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:23,310
I had on the 10th of September after my daughter's wedding. At night it was the wedding,

51
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:31,420
in the morning I woke up with the pain and on the flight here in September 9 days after.

52
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:44,890
 Since then I didn't have it in the right anymore. That's the aggravation. After that I felt good,

53
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:54,370
the ears and the stress on my head gone all together, the well-being was beautiful,

54
00:07:54,470 --> 00:08:00,620
my memory came back, I was more clear on studying, it was more easy for me to study

55
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,450
and to remember what I studied because normally I used to read the Materia Medica,

56
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:12,050
understand it beautifully, after 2 hours I completely mixed it with others.

57
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:26,290
It was very disturbing this. It was fine and then about October we studied at home with friends

58
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:35,120
and suddenly one of them told me that I look bad, that I'm very red and she was very worried,

59
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:42,450
I felt good, I didn't feel bad, I run from the kitchen to the study room and I

60
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:47,700
checked my blood pressure and it was very high. She was very concerned, she took

61
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:55,700
some symptoms and a few days later she gave me a remedy. I asked her what it is, she

62
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:05,550
didn't want to tell me. I took it and then within a week or something I started feeling bad

63
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:13,450
really bad, lack of the well-being, I saw really a big difference.

64
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,210
-Still today you don't know what it was the remedy?

65
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:21,200
-I thought that it was Sulphur because of the things it gave me and another homeopath

66
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:26,200
when I explained, he told me it was Sulphur and she was talking about all the time that

67
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:34,700
she thinks that I'm Sulphur and not Phosphorus and I'm sure it was Sulphur. After I asked

68
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,700
her I felt bad and I asked her, please tell, I need to know, she said I gave you a placebo

69
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:49,870
because I wanted to see how autosuggestive you are, to prove it. I don't think it's right

70
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:55,120
because she was quite concerned about my health and I don't think if somebody is that

71
00:09:55,220 --> 00:10:01,870
concerned will give you a placebo, just to check you. It's stupid but that's what she says

72
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,720
and she keeps saying till now.

73
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:16,870
Anyway I had burns after I took it, all my body was burning and then I had underneath

74
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:26,120
the breast really itching and burning and red and then in the end of December I went to

75
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,380
the Dead Sea and I went to the swimming pool in the hotel, have the water of the Dead

76
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:39,870
Sea, for a few minutes. I came out and it was like a burn, which held on for 4 months

77
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:52,370
really suffering like a real open burn, very liquid, very scratchy and nothing helped.

78
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:59,870
It didn't go away, that's why I think maybe it was Sulphur. I don't know but it gave me the

79
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:09,110
idea. And there is a lot of Sulphur in the water of the Dead Sea. That's why I thought, it

80
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:21,040
smelled like Sulphur. In April I went to Ireland to a seminar and I met Vega again.

81
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:25,440
He gave me the Argentum nitricum last time and he said, maybe you need another

82
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:34,440
remedy, you should take another remedy because I owe you one, come on, let's do your

83
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:42,940
case. I really had high blood pressure and I really was worried, I tried to call here and I

84
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:51,020
was stuck because everything started going down again. So he took my case and he told

85
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:58,890
me, listen I think you are the princess on the pea. I looked at him and said, what do you mean

86
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:17,010
princess on the pea. He said because you are princess on the pea I'll give you a very noble herb,

87
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:25,680
I'll give Colchicum, it's a safran and it's suitable for you. I asked him to explain why,

88
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:38,930
what he sees and he said that I'm very sensitive to everything, all external and especially to rudeness,

89
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:44,840
that's what he said and a few other symptoms. He took the asthma and the colitis

90
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:52,590
and a few other things and he gave me the Cochicum. I took the Colchicum just when I came

91
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:56,840
and he said don't take a lap because you are very sensitive,

92
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:06,090
take one globule. So I took one globule and then 10 days after I came to the seminar

93
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:14,110
here in May, I was so irritable, I've never been so irritable in my life. Everything bothered

94
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:23,590
me, everything, every smell, every movement, everything that everybody did. It was such

95
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:30,590
a strong irritability, worse than ever and I was before my period again which combined

96
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:36,260
the both and it was a real mess.

97
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:45,760
Normally I need my sleep. I need to sleep at least 5 hours and I had a problem with the

98
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:52,590
room mate that used to wake up very early like 4 o'clock in the morning and I couldn't

99
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:59,600
sleep and it made me more edgy, more edgy every day it went more and more and then

100
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:16,340
after 4 days suddenly I had like the acid of my stomach came up, real acid up and burned

101
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:23,850
the whole trachea, everything. I felt like acid was poured in and I was sure that it's

102
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:31,840
burning holes. I started taking water and water, it didn't help, then I took one globule of

103
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:41,590
Nux vomica 30, diluted in water and took one spoon out of it, everything gone away plus

104
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:51,430
the irritability, everything cut off, then I was much more calmer. But later on irritability

105
00:14:51,530 --> 00:15:01,180
came again and again, my head wasn't clear anymore and in some ways I felt good but

106
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:07,430
in some ways I didn't feel good, I was too irritable for the people around me, for me it

107
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:14,930
wasn't so bad but everybody complained. I called Vega and I said listen it's impossible

108
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:21,430
I'm losing my friends, he said forget it, it's good for you, what do you care about them, in

109
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:26,680
the end it will help you, probably you didn't take the right potency, we'll try higher.

110
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,010
-What potency it was?

111
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:38,430
-He gave me 12C one globule, so I said forget it and in the middle of July I took

112
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:50,430
Phosphorus again 200, no beginning of August, I said that's it I'm going back to Phos

113
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:58,460
forget everything else, I felt good, I'm going back to it and I took Phos 200. I had a

114
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:07,160
horrible aggravation, I thought I'm having a heart attack, it's exactly what the girl with

115
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:18,490
Phosphorus said about. I had real strong pressure and pain in my left chest and very

116
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:25,240
strong pain in the hand that I couldn't even move, it was paralyzed and I told myself relax,

117
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:33,240
relax, it's OK it's the Phos, don't go to the hospital, it's OK you are not going to die and I

118
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:38,490
begged him and said, don't do it to me. It was my daughter's birthday and we had to fly to

119
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:46,400
Switzerland 5 days later and I said please god don't do it to me, don't let my daughter

120
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:53,660
remember every time in her birthday this way. And it passed in the evening and the next

121
00:16:53,760 --> 00:17:01,910
morning another thing started, again it was pressure in the hand but it went like a needle

122
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:12,990
inside my throat like pulsating, like a needle is pulsating, it's not the blood that you feel.

123
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:23,820
It was like a sharp instrument pulsating here, it was very funny feeling and I cope with this

124
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:31,570
till the afternoon, then I was fed up, I was really worried then and I asked a friend of mine

125
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:38,330
and she told me go to the hospital now, don't leave it. I said OK, I went to bed, I fall

126
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:48,320
asleep, I woke up an hour later, fabulous I felt really good, no nausea, no vomiting, no

127
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:59,930
bad feeling and... and I studied till 12 o'clock at night in another city and then we went

128
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:05,680
out till 3 o'clock in the morning. And I came home happy and since then I have any

129
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:12,180
problem at all, I just feel better and better every day. The most important for me my head

130
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:22,440
is clear and the ears are clear, I can study better, the main thing that changed since a

131
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:31,430
year ago is my inner feeling. It's my well being and the way I look at things, I'm not that

132
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:40,440
obsessed anymore, I had the irritability after the Colchicum but it's not the same kind that

133
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:49,690
I had before. Before everything that happened around touched me, everything. If I saw

134
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:54,440
somebody in the street needing help, he didn't have to open his mouth, I was on him.

135
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,540
Sometimes it's too much.

136
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:00,520
-I remember you were describing this before.

137
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:11,210
-Some people don't like that, don't like to owe you anything, they don't need your help.

138
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:15,190
-Yes, it's better if somebody wants your help to ask always.

139
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:23,140
-And that's what I learned, I had a good lesson and another thing I learned the last two weeks

140
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:32,490
which changed me a lot, I got somebody very clever told me that my soul is driven

141
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:39,220
by two energies. One is red which is the feeling and one is blue which is the logic but

142
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:46,220
they all stand in one line waiting for the referee to ring with a whistle and then the both

143
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:52,470
running at the same time, none of them letting the other one to go first and it makes me

144
00:19:52,570 --> 00:20:05,560
stand on the same spot all the time, I don't go forward. So he said, let the wise one

145
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:14,440
retreat back and then you will do whatever you need. I think the wise one is the feelings.

146
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,940
-I don't know.

147
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:23,800
-They are more wiser than the logic, so the feeling will go back and the logic will go front.

148
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,750
-These are theories.
-All kind of theories.

149
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:39,710
I just wanted to tell you I have new symptoms. By the way after the Colchicum the urine

150
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:49,380
was bright yellow like the color of the Colchicum, it's very funny. I still don't drink enough.

151
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:58,130
I hardly drink 2-3 glasses the day, I still am thirsty at night, dry and the urine has a smell

152
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:09,080
lately of turpentine like oil colors, remind me when I used to paint, the same kind of smell and a funny

153
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:20,750
feeling on my feet for a few months now. I wake up in the morning, the feet is cold but it's burning.

154
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,900
-It's cold outside?

155
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:32,400
-Yes if you touch it it's cold but it's a few things. Sometimes I feel it like burning from the

156
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:40,960
inside but it's usually that the toe and the little fingers, this part but in the legs but

157
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:53,190
sometimes it's feel like from chilblain, like from ice, if you step on ice. Sometimes it's like

158
00:21:53,290 --> 00:22:06,190
needles and sometimes is tickling, tickling also here, not only up but all the time when it's

159
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:16,440
happened, the feet feel like an edema, like half-numbed. If I touch it it's like I'm touching a

160
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:27,800
part which is covering it. It's funny and it's every day, usually when I'm resting, not when I'm walking.

161
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,950
-How long you have this symptom?

162
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:43,130
-Since the beginning of the year or something like this.

163
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:53,210
I had it already before she gave me the remedy and that's why I think of Sulphur. I don't know.

164
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:07,710
My last 2 periods were a disaster.

165
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,630
-A lot of blood?

166
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:20,530
-In bed at night, even here in Alonissos, very embarrassing. Maybe it's from Phosphorus.

167
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:24,030
-Maybe it's approaching the end.

168
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:45,320
-I wish to get rid of it. And I have like a little here only when I'm ovulating but not every

169
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:54,320
month, twice the year or something. Now it came here. It left a mark, it never comes out

170
00:23:54,420 --> 00:24:01,070
 it stays in, it hurts it gets red, it hurts and then 2 days it goes down and it leaves a blue mark

171
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:09,070
like this. until the next time if it decides to come in the same place or on my buttocks or somewhere.

172
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,070
-No other eruption?

173
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:21,550
-I had a little bit in the beginning of the year, I had a little bit eczema in the hands and

174
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:28,050
scratching here and there but that's all. I used to have an eczema here when I was

175
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:39,550
younger and after giving birth but I don't wash dishes anymore. My kids and my husband

176
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,730
are doing it, so I don't have eczema anymore.

177
00:24:55,370 --> 00:25:01,320
The last time I had this pain in the right chest was after the Colchicum.

178
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:12,850
In the left I had after the Colchicum, a very strong pain in the left, like I had after the last

179
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:16,450
Phosphorus and now it comes in the left, not in the right anymore.

180
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,950
-Anything else?

181
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:38,100
-I'm trying to think what I had before and I don't have now. I think that's the only things that I have.

182
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:44,280
-OK, it's easy prescription, they will get only 5 points for your case.

183
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:20,630
She is sensitive, she is very sensitive and she is a good prover. She could be in a proving

184
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:27,730
group and she could give most probably a lot of information about wrong medicines.

185
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:45,040
The problem of course is that, as you see, the remedy which is touching the case,

186
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:53,540
of course she would be touched most probably by most of the remedies because of her sensitivity

187
00:26:53,640 --> 00:27:00,570
but let us say it is a stronger organism. You give the wrong remedy,

188
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:10,760
then an aggravation is produced without real amelioration and as a result...

189
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:19,240
You know after Colchicum she was having this big reaction, then she had to take Nux vomica,

190
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:30,350
she took Nux vomica. What happened? If we want to analyze her case, she is Phosphorus

191
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:38,990
and she takes Phos and then most probably she will need another remedy.

192
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,340
Who prescribed Phos for her case?

193
00:27:49,090 --> 00:28:01,910
You knew it that's why because it was not a clear Phos and we debated very much for 1 hour

194
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:08,910
and then I said Phos, nobody was happy. Everybody wanted to give another remedy

195
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:16,680
but anyhow it doesn't matter. Now she takes Phos and Phos layer goes away and then

196
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:22,420
there is another layer, whatever it might be, a milder one and somebody gives her a remedy

197
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:30,180
and aggravates this layer and then another remedy and it's further aggravation

198
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:42,530
and then eventually you see the layer which is formed is not the Phos, it is the Nux vomica layer.

199
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:52,030
Let us say she took Phos in that stage where she took Nux vomica, Phos won't work.

200
00:28:53,530 --> 00:29:05,610
Phos will not work. She needed Nux vomica to reduce. It's like an acute.

201
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:18,760
Let us say you are needing Lycopodium and you get an acute, a bronchitis, in which you need

202
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:26,010
Nux vomica or Sulphur. You can not take Lycopodium and by the time you are needing

203
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:35,750
Nux vomica. It's not going to work and if she had made a mistake,

204
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:44,720
she says OK let me go back to Phos, by the time she was producing a picture of Nux vomica,

205
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,270
Phos will not act.

206
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:59,290
Now she takes Nux vomica and this goes away and then the layer is back because the pressure,

207
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:08,290
the nausea, all the symptomatology that was Phosphorus symptomatology eventually

208
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:14,790
came back. What would have happened in case she had not.

209
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:24,540
Let us she had continued without taking any further medication. We can not know of course

210
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:39,200
but my idea would be that she would, eventually because it was a low potency 30,

211
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:46,790
though for her being so sensitive 30, you remember we had an argument in the class

212
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:52,290
that because she is sensitive we didn't want to give a high potency, we only gave 30.

213
00:30:52,390 --> 00:31:03,040
So 30 would keep her for say 9 months and then eventually out of a stress, she may had a relapse

214
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:12,790
and then she would need again Phosphorus. So actually she took Phosphorus 1 year again later,

215
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:19,290
almost exactly 1 year you repeated Phosphorus 200.

216
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:29,300
So that means now Phosphorus is going to act longer and you have to be careful not to take

217
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:39,640
easily medication because your system will be upset very soon. Let it strengthen, be strong.

218
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:52,790
This element which she described that went away it is very important for Phosphorus element

219
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:58,640
because she jumped into a situation to help.

220
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:11,790
But this is beyond the natural thing and she realizes it now, she says maybe I was interfering

221
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:26,710
too much out of my anxiety, which is a sign showing that a balance is coming from a deeper level,

222
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:28,800
 which is the most important.

223
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:52,400
What is the blood pressure now? After 5 minutes take it again, it will be different. Don't worry.

224
00:32:55,150 --> 00:33:03,550
-How important is thirst?
-You see how important it is, she has no thirst.

225
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:04,810
-It doesn't matter?

226
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:11,300
-Of course it doesn't matter. If all the other symptoms are Phosphorus where is the thirst?

227
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,800
-How many percent of the patients do they have thirst?

228
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:22,090
-I don't know, I can not say but definitely there are cases where there is no thirst.

229
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:41,440
The high blood pressure now it shows the suggestibility that there is with the Phosphorus.

230
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:51,140
Something very interesting also she said about this numbness on the toes.

231
00:33:51,240 --> 00:34:07,190
Phosphorus has, I want to show a rubric. I want to show you the tendency of Phosphorus to produce

232
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:22,770
numbness on the tips of the fingers or of the toes. I want to show you in the Repertory so

233
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:35,530
you can remember. This is a keynote for Phosphorus. For those who have the Repertories,

234
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:44,370
if you open, numbness on tips of fingers. Open your Repertories on numbness on tips of fingers.

235
00:34:46,620 --> 00:35:15,040
There is only one capital. Go now to numbness on toes. Phosphorus is with italics.

236
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:32,990
Can you make a comment on this? She pointed out on the toes that are the tips of the toes.

237
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:38,750
She showed you. You go there, you see the toes. You go on the other,

238
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:49,330
you see the tips of the fingers are numbed, so that means Phos has a tendency to produce

239
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:59,680
numbness on the tips. So therefore that symptom is a symptom that belongs to Phosphorus.

240
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:12,940
-We started with the findings here. You came here and you just found them?

241
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:19,440
-No, I started feeling bad lately, I didn't even want to come.

242
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:23,560
-How lately? 1 month, 20 days?

243
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:36,130
-It comes and goes. Actually all this started at the beginning of May after I took Phos again

244
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:43,630
on the 26th of April, I took 30C again and then the feeling this stooped

245
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:49,590
ears started so I presume it was again the high blood pressure going up.

246
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:51,090
-Did you check it by that time?

247
00:36:51,190 --> 00:37:02,330
-I checked it and it was 149 over 110, 135 over 100 or 111. It didn't go up to 120 the

248
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:11,580
lowest and now it starts getting worse and worse. Yesterday especially I started feeling

249
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:22,550
bad, so at night I felt, when we left here I felt really bad and I asked Costas to bring the

250
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:31,340
blood pressure from the pharmacy to check and Sylvia checked it and it was 220 over 140.

251
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,690
-Yesterday evening?
-Yesterday at 9.30.

252
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:41,250
-I see. Before that did you check the previous day?

253
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:43,250
-No, I didn't check.

254
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:48,810
-Only last night. Because somebody was telling me that you have a very high blood

255
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:54,630
pressure but not today, it was telling me this before.

256
00:37:54,730 --> 00:38:02,960
-Yes I had, I knew that I had but not that high.
-I see.

257
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:06,210
-Only when I gave birth I was very high.

258
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:15,580
-I see also that you put on some weight. You've put about 6 kilos, you know that?

259
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,560
-I don't get my period that's the main problem.

260
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:24,880
-No, the main problem is the eating. You try to find an excuse.

261
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:36,450
-Yes I stopped my diet, I couldn't do it the last 2 months, I stopped. I didn't watch.

262
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,550
Before I was watching.

263
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:44,870
-What is happening inside your psychology?
-A lot of problems.

264
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:45,730
-I can see.

265
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:55,650
-It started last November, December and I started having questions. I always put them

266
00:38:55,750 --> 00:39:05,060
aside, I was too busy doing things and I never went inside and ask things and I started

267
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:16,340
getting really worried about Homeopathy, about taking cases, I got cold feet and it really

268
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:23,340
troubled me because normally when I do something I like to know that I know what I'm

269
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:31,420
doing and I found myself in a way that I'm afraid that I wouldn't know what I'm doing.

270
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:41,860
Like OK I can take a case and good I'll get the remedy, that's not a big deal, I hope I will

271
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:46,730
not make any damage. Even in taking the remedy I was worried if I give another potency

272
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:53,060
but this wasn't the biggest problem. The biggest problem will be in handling the case

273
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:59,540
which I got the answer now. I feel a little bit more comfortable but it bothers me a lot that

274
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:06,290
I can take a case and then what happens. If something like this happens, what I do?

275
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:14,580
I don't like that. I like to be prepared especially if I'm dealing with somebody's health

276
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:19,610
because in my experience I had a lot of problems with people's remedies before and I

277
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:27,860
don't like to hurt anybody. That was my biggest problem actually. Then there was a group

278
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:34,960
arranging to go to India. In December they told us that in January they are taking 20

279
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:44,210
people to go to India, whoever first, will go. So sure I went, I did decide to go, I thought

280
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:49,980
maybe it will give me some more answers and then I'll decide what I'm going to do.

281
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:54,900
Because I was in the middle of opening a clinic, I have my own office which I'm

282
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,820
running, I have enough things to do, many things to do and if I'm going into Homeopathy

283
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:10,270
if I want to do, I want to do it full time but then I have to give up the other. So I was in a lot

284
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:24,250
of stress, here, there. So I went to India and I felt quite OK, I felt very fine there, relieved.

285
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:32,550
It's funny energy, it's very special energy, I didn't care, it wasn't me. My friend said, look

286
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:36,210
how Phos works on you, you have so changed.

287
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:41,460
-It's not Phosphorus, it's the fact that you went away from responsibilities. Your high

288
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:46,310
blood pressure is the responsibility blood pressure.

289
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,210
-It could be.

290
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:54,210
-You went away and you felt now I don't have anymore responsibility, I can relax and you

291
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:57,560
relaxed, not Phosphorus.

292
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:05,090
-It could be, anyway everybody had this case taking there and we discussed and

293
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:10,070
everything and somebody told me, now you are not Phos, you are something else.

294
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:14,860
You have mixed with some things and I said OK, let's see you take it differently because

295
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:22,670
you take it in a different way, dreams and like this. And this thing really worried me.

296
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:30,320
-Yes but can you give me the symptoms, you give me all the stories. Just give me your symptoms.

297
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:33,270
-Then or now?
-Now.

298
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:42,860
-Now I just wanted to tell you that I took Magnesia phosphorica.

299
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:48,260
-Why? How you came to that? By dreams?

300
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:55,260
-By dreams, everything that came out from childhood and things like this that I always

301
00:42:55,360 --> 00:43:02,760
manage by myself because nobody was there for me. Anyway I took it and it didn't

302
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:08,510
accept that I cried the whole case taking and I came out with a headache and I took

303
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:12,510
immediately the remedy and the headache continued until the morning. I didn't have any

304
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:20,420
aggravation symptom or any special symptom that I can say but 2 weeks later we had

305
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:28,170
Jurgen Becker came back in Israel in a seminar and during the seminar he gave people to do

306
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:34,430
proving. He said if a lot of people doing the proving, the others who sit next to them

307
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:40,450
maybe they can get affected because too many people taking the remedy.

308
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:44,950
-If you sit next to the man who takes the remedy?
-Yes, you get affected.

309
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:50,700
-It must be a man or a woman?
-Ask Ortega.

310
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:55,700
-Because by a woman you can be affected, I don't think by a man who takes the remedy.

311
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:03,450
-I laughed at it and I didn't believe in it and the next day I came to the seminar after 100

312
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:13,700
people took it, it was something made of tar, the tar remedy.

313
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,940
-It doesn't matter. You felt you were affected?

314
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:22,690
-It doesn't matter; the first day nothing, the second day I don't know I thought about it 2

315
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:27,690
weeks later and I don't know maybe it's from that, maybe it's from the Mag phos but I was

316
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:32,680
very depressed. I fell into a very deep depression that I never had in my life.

317
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:33,690
-Yes?

318
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:39,090
-Never, in my life I was so depressed, I felt like I don't know what I'm doing here, what

319
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:44,170
I'm living, what I'm going to do, I don't care about nothing, I don't want to go to work,

320
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:49,670
I don't want to do nothing, I just want to die. That was the feeling.

321
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:53,420
-How long it lasted?
-10 days.

322
00:44:53,520 --> 00:45:00,200
-10 days in depression and you were sitting next to the same man all the time?

323
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:10,420
-No. It happened after the seminar, I'm trying to find answers, so it could be either this or

324
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:16,100
not. I don't know really. I never had depression like this in my past, I don't know.

325
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:24,500
Then I started having this burning sensation that I have in the acute, like acid comes up

326
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:29,130
and burning, even at night suddenly I wake up like a vomit.

327
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:35,380
-But that was in India with the food?
-No, that was in Israel after I came back.

328
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,460
-With the same food that you usually eat.

329
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:44,250
-Yes, it's nothing to do with the food. That was together with this depression and I said

330
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:52,460
that's it, enough. I took Nux vomica, like I do when I have this. I took Nux vomica diluted

331
00:45:52,560 --> 00:46:00,580
in water, I tried 5C it didn't help, I took 30C, I took a few sips in the morning I was a new

332
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:08,250
person, no burning, no depression, no nothing. It went away.

333
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:15,250
-So I see you can cure yourself better than the Professors.

334
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:20,180
-I don't know. Nux vomica helps when I have this kind of feeling, I take it and I did it

335
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:28,930
already 3 times and it works. Maybe it cleans up also the bad force and everything else.

336
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:40,180
-I see you are sighing, why you don't realize this? You feel a heaviness on the chest or what?

337
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:50,430
-Yes I feel heavy and 2 weeks after I took the Nux vomica I start having hot flashes. It's

338
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:58,240
not hot flashes, it's like burning from here up to here suddenly like an oven opens,

339
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:03,340
burning so strong, real fire that you look for air.

340
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:10,500
-How long you have this burning?
-I have this burning since April.

341
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:19,990
-And you don't get your menses for how long?
-I didn't get it since then. I had last time in March.

342
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:22,110
-So it's climacteric with much...

343
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:29,240
-Yes but the funny thing that I get the symptoms which I get before menses, the

344
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:36,340
symptoms that I get in ovulating, which is also certain ones which I'd like to tell you.

345
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:48,250
I used to get the last 2 years in ovulating an abscess, not each month but quite

346
00:47:48,350 --> 00:48:00,490
frequently. Like a round red ball between the legs, once here or here, sometimes on my

347
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:04,430
buttocks and one I had here.

348
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,330
-This abscess opens?

349
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:15,830
-No, it could get very hard, very red, it could come to this size and really painful and then

350
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:25,360
it leaves a purple mark, when it calms down. The last one I had was on the 26th of the

351
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:31,860
same day as I took the Phosphorus, I got one here and at night it was so painful.

352
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:35,610
-But you never mentioned that. That is such a strong symptom, as you describe it.

353
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:44,780
-Because it went away, 2 years ago. I didn't have it anymore. I think it went away after

354
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:53,580
Calcarea Sulphurica and then I had it once or twice but very little. Now I got it again.

355
00:48:55,800 --> 00:49:01,900
I have new symptom before menses which I never had the last 6 months, I feel like I

356
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:09,050
have a flu, pain here, in all my bones.

357
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:11,950
-As if you have a flu but no real flu.

358
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:22,280
-And then the next day no flu, menses come. The body aches and the back aches and I

359
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:24,280
feel hot like I have a fever.

360
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:29,780
-That's a symptom of Magnesia. It came after Magnesia?

361
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:37,030
-No, I had it before, already 6 periods and I had only 1 period after the Magnesia.

362
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:38,780
-When did you get that?

363
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:48,980
-End of January, I got the Magnesia around the 7th of February. Maybe that's why she

364
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:58,360
gave it to me because I told her all this and this is at least 6 periods that I had. Otherwise

365
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:03,860
I wouldn't have paid attention to it that it comes. Only after a few times I found out that it's

366
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,620
just before the menses.

367
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,950
-Then?

368
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:23,200
-Another symptom after I took the Phosphorus the numbness in the feet came back

369
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:34,950
which I didn't have anymore the last few months and the nails are breaking. The last year

370
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:46,360
are breaking to pieces and still ascending is very hard for me and very strong ailments

371
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:49,960
from bad news I have, very strong.

372
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:53,110
-How you came to that conclusion?

373
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:59,700
-I found out that every time I hear something about somebody's health...

374
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:04,300
-Anxiety about others, this is not ailments from bad news.

375
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:13,050
-No, if I hear something bad that happened.
-Bad news is when you see in television.

376
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:27,800
-Also, I really feel sick afterwards. Things like this but especially if somebody is sick or

377
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:34,380
dead, I feel very sorry when I hear that somebody got very sick.

378
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:46,280
I still have this feeling, it came back, when/if I go to sleep in the afternoon, when I wake

379
00:51:46,380 --> 00:52:01,530
up I feel very heavy and nauseated like heavy headache. I have again this thing in the

380
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:07,270
back, like somebody is putting his hand here in the scapula. The pain didn't come back

381
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:12,630
in the last 8 months but the hand is back.

382
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:17,780
-As if somebody is touching?
-Yes, as if somebody is put a hand.

383
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,030
-Touching or pushing?

384
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:26,780
-No, touching. I feel the warmth of a hand, so funny. For years I have it.

385
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:31,530
-You can create any symptom under the earth by your mind.

386
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:34,790
-No.
-This is what I think.

387
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:44,020
-No, I didn't have much symptoms left. I just had it now, so I remembered and I wrote it.

388
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:47,530
-The feeling of a touch of a hand, you will not find it.

389
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:59,950
-And a very dry in the evening. I don't drink in the day at all, nearly nothing. Only if people

390
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:10,290
remind me to drink. But in the evening and at night my mouth is really dry, so I drink more.

391
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:26,700
-With these flashes that you get, you get a feeling of anxiety at the same time?

392
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:36,180
-No, just horrible. I can't stand it, it's burning but since I took the Phosphorus at the end

393
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:41,930
of April, I don't have it anymore at night. I used to have it the whole month at night I couldn't sleep.

394
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:49,930
 I went for vacation for 1 week to Hungary. I though I'll rest there. I didn't sleep 1 night.

395
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:51,520
-From flashes?

396
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:58,420
-It was like a central heating, suddenly burning you and then I had clammy...

397
00:53:58,520 --> 00:53:59,920
-It was from the waist?

398
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:09,170
-It's here, it's not coming up, it just comes like this and it burns you. Right now and it

399
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:17,170
comes off very easily, very light and not that often but then I used to have it 15 times the

400
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:28,180
day and non stop at night. I used to wake up wet, clammy and in the morning I had a smell like...

401
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,670
-Now you don't have that flashing?

402
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:39,660
-Not in the night, only in the day, 2-3 times the day after I took the Phos, really less.

403
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:52,210
I still have it for 1-2 min, before it was really strong, impossible and it was very cold in Hungary.

404
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:56,630
-Next tell me.

405
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:11,210
-I don't think I have anything. I still sleep on the right side.

406
00:55:15,710 --> 00:55:21,280
Memory.
-It's down?

407
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:33,040
-Down. What I found out is I desire company, I can't stay alone. It really aggravates my situations.

408
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:34,780
-Next?

409
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:44,880
-I desire sweets before menses, I still desire the menses didn't arrive but still desire and  a smell acute.

410
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:50,030
-Your smell has become acute?

411
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:57,190
-Yes, the last 2 months crazy, it bothers me. Now a little bit less the last weeks but it's

412
00:55:57,290 --> 00:56:05,800
difficult, over sensitive to smell, I can smell every little thing and ...

413
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:24,030
That's the most important things and the feeling that I have.

414
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:33,280
-Feeling?
-Yes, I lost the joy of life.

415
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:38,880
-You feel?
-Not happy.

416
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:51,880
-And you cry much more.
-Yes, when I think about it  I cry.

417
00:56:53,130 --> 00:57:03,470
-In general your temperature of the body has become warmer or stays the same or even more cold?

418
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:13,110
-When I feel bad it's cold. I feel cold, when I don't feel good I suddenly have a chill but

419
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:23,220
normally in comparison to others I'm still hot but not that hot, as I used to be.

420
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:53,460
-You eat a lot of sweets? Why you put on weight?

421
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:59,860
-I stopped the diet. I did a diet and I lost weight and I went to Hungary and I decided

422
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:07,610
that's it, enough. I can't stand it any longer, watching all the time, not eating what I like.

423
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:19,720
I lost my joy of life, be on diet all the time. You become a not happy person, what do you

424
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:26,550
need to live for? You don't do this, you don't do this. I prefer to live shorter life and a  happy one.

425
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:32,700
-Not with the blood pressure 220.

426
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:38,200
-I never went up to this high. Maybe I was upset yesterday.

427
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:44,450
-Anybody will tell you a remedy, you will just take it. That is a problem with Homeopathy.

428
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:50,950
-No. I didn't want to take it but I didn't want to offend the person, so I took it. That's

429
00:58:51,050 --> 00:59:02,200
another problem I have. I don't like to offend, to hurt people and anyway it was such a

430
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:08,200
long time and blood pressure was still high and I thought may be because you touched

431
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:19,300
little things that happened when I was a child. Really what she explained to me sounds really...

432
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:27,000
-But this suppose to be a release, when the sub-conscious comes to conscious, this is

433
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:32,500
a treatment actually in psychotherapy, it releases the organism. It doesn't load the  organism.

434
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:41,750
-I felt good, with the remedy or without the remedy. I cried and cried and cried.

435
00:59:41,850 --> 00:59:50,750
-If you cried... but then the organism if the remedy is correct, has to be a release.

436
00:59:50,850 --> 00:59:58,820
If the psychotherapy brings out something which is there underlined on the sub- conscious,

437
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:08,770
brings it up, then it's good for the organism, not putting pressure.

438
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:22,120
-Pressure is now after 3 months already. It was 3 months ago. Something happened

439
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:27,270
maybe he was right with this horrible drug that he gave everybody, I don't know.

440
01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:34,960
-You see the organism does not keep order. If you take remedies which you don't  need...

441
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:51,780
-When I took Phos now I start getting all my old symptoms, one by one again the 30.

442
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:58,770
Little cramps, little this, little that. Now I got high blood pressure, last time I nearly had

443
01:00:58,870 --> 01:01:06,870
heart attack when I took it. I felt like I'm going to have a heart attack.

444
01:01:10,620 --> 01:01:21,790
Not coryza, the nose is not running, it's just like a fever and pain here and in the back

445
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:28,390
it's like a flu with no coryza. I never have coryza unless I cry.

446
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:38,620
-You don't get acutes?
-The last one was 2 years ago, a very strong one.

447
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:41,370
-What was? Bronchitis?
-Yes.

448
01:01:41,470 --> 01:01:43,380
-And you took antibiotics?

449
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:53,120
-Yes, after a while I had to because it became pneumonia and problems. A homeopath

450
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:54,970
gave me antibiotics.

451
01:01:58,220 --> 01:01:59,120
-What he can do?

452
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:08,480
-After we waited nearly a month, it was very strong, very problematic.

453
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:17,310
-Flashes on chest did you find?
-On sternum?

454
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:24,300
-No, this is different. This is internal.
-I have that also.

455
01:02:26,650 --> 01:02:52,800
-Heat flashes on chest, can you find this?
-Rising to chest?

456
01:02:52,900 --> 01:03:04,800
-No.
-You have strong aversion sex?

457
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:10,640
-Not aversion but I don't feel like. I don't desire it at all.

458
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:18,900
-No desire. When did you lose this desire? 10 years ago?

459
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,740
-Not 10 years ago but at least the last year.

460
01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:37,090
-Your feet in bed are warm?
-Yes.

461
01:03:37,190 --> 01:03:39,550
-You stick them out always?

462
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:48,490
-Today not, the last 2 days but when it's hot yes for sure. Even in winter I like to put my

463
01:03:48,590 --> 01:04:01,230
feet out. Tickling, the feet are tickling...

464
01:04:01,330 --> 01:04:08,830
-Cracking of your feet?
-No, it's tickling.

465
01:04:09,330 --> 01:04:20,580
-Itching?
-Like needles it tickles sometimes.

466
01:04:43,910 --> 01:04:49,730
-When we took your case you had this vertigo from high places?

467
01:04:49,830 --> 01:05:00,250
-I still have. I don't like high places. I imagine myself falling down.

468
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:25,400
-Do you remember having any skin eruption in young age?

469
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:31,150
-Yes a lot. I used to have a lot of eczema.

470
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:33,150
-And you took cortisone or things like that?

471
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:42,580
-Yes. I had this what the other lady mentioned, that she had here, I used to have it a lot.

472
01:06:02,330 --> 01:06:05,670
I had asthma, I had eczema...

473
01:06:16,570 --> 01:06:23,220
-Do you say you are better with company, you feel better?

474
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:34,470
-Much better, even a male. Even if I don't feel good and I have company, I feel different a different person.

475
01:06:34,570 --> 01:06:36,470
-It's not only that you desire, you feel better.

476
01:06:36,570 --> 01:06:46,570
-I feel better. It's more feel better than desire.

477
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:56,530
-Worse alone.

478
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:09,110
-I have to tell you that I took Mercury and I had 1 year symptoms, I wouldn't like to pass this again.

479
01:07:09,610 --> 01:07:20,100
-You see the idea is to find a series of remedies, once you mix up now, you will have a problem.

480
01:07:22,530 --> 01:07:26,930
-It's the same symptoms that I always had except this heat.

481
01:07:27,030 --> 01:07:29,010
-No.

482
01:07:29,110 --> 01:07:32,590
-The heat I had when I was 42.

483
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:47,240
-Do you eat fruits?
-No.

484
01:07:47,340 --> 01:07:50,600
-You don't like fruits?
-Not so much.

485
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:57,970
-Do you like motion?

486
01:08:00,050 --> 01:08:05,330
-I like to be busy, I don't like exertion.

487
01:08:05,430 --> 01:08:14,420
-You sigh a lot?
-I take a deep breath, it's not sighing.

488
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:18,020
-Need for deep breath.

489
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:48,990
-Sulphur.

490
01:08:50,290 --> 01:08:54,130
-Next remedy which comes after Sulphur?
-Nothing.

491
01:08:54,230 --> 01:09:03,730
-Nothing? Only Sulphur. What symptoms did you put, it's interesting.

492
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:17,130
-What caught my attention was that I have the impression that she has a thyroid and I 'd

493
01:09:17,230 --> 01:09:23,230
like to know if she takes a medicament for this or if she has been examined before.

494
01:09:24,990 --> 01:09:27,980
-It was examined and everything is normal.

495
01:09:37,230 --> 01:09:45,460
-Sometimes when the thyroid is misfunctioning it has a repercussion on blood pressure.

496
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:52,010
So that's correct, what you thought is correct from your studies in medicine.

497
01:09:53,810 --> 01:09:59,210
Remedies which I was thinking also is Phosphorus, Ignatia and Sulphur and most

498
01:09:59,310 --> 01:10:08,460
probably many of you have been thinking of these remedies as well. Whether we are

499
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:14,710
going to repeat now Phosphorus on high potency, whether we are going to give Ignatia

500
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:22,060
first or whether to go to Sulphur is the main issue that occupied my mind.

501
01:10:29,730 --> 01:10:35,630
To my understanding, we left it here, I said when we finished, you didn't tell the whole

502
01:10:35,730 --> 01:10:44,140
story. She said yes. You see this loading inside which is quite strong, you see the blood

503
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:53,130
pressure going so high, it's not for nothing, that means things are inside the organism

504
01:10:53,230 --> 01:10:57,880
which are pressurizing though she has a tendency to high blood pressure, the blood

505
01:10:57,980 --> 01:10:59,980
pressure is now too high.

506
01:11:04,730 --> 01:11:18,130
And therefore my reasoning is, is it because of some malignant stenosis or kidney

507
01:11:18,230 --> 01:11:25,230
problem or is it purely because of psychological reasons?

508
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:37,540
I see she is loaded, she cries quite easily, there is a possibility also for Amyl nitrate

509
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:45,540
because of that particular way she has these heat flashes. Amyl nitrate has this in the

510
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:56,870
upper part of the body; and high blood pressure and flashes can bring from that point of

511
01:11:56,970 --> 01:12:06,870
view Amyl nitrate. The same, we can have the idea of Pulsatilla because she seems to

512
01:12:06,970 --> 01:12:19,950
be changing symptoms or the crying which is quite prominent but her character is very

513
01:12:20,050 --> 01:12:32,820
sympathetic. She maintains that and she insists when others have problems, she takes

514
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:44,910
her and that is again very strong symptom of Phosphorus of course.

515
01:12:46,390 --> 01:12:50,140
She says also that she does not take much...

516
01:12:58,470 --> 01:13:05,470
-If I eat fruit, I eat pineapple when I'm in India or hardly I eat any fruit.

517
01:13:05,970 --> 01:13:11,370
-Why? Because you don't like or you don't have the opportunity?

518
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:22,620
-No, it is there. If I eat an apple, it gives me heart burn and if I eat fruit, I eat hard and

519
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:28,370
sour, not ripe but I hardly eat any fruit. So in the beginning of the season I eat a little bit

520
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:30,470
and then when they are ripe, I don't touch it.

521
01:13:51,250 --> 01:13:56,970
-Feet out of covers as she says, it is a characteristic of both Pulsatilla and Sulphur.

522
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:08,040
The desire for sweets is quite strong, she puts on weight. What other symptoms of

523
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:17,890
Sulphur you have there except of desire for sweets and feet out of covers?

524
01:14:20,420 --> 01:14:21,640
-Acute smell.

525
01:14:28,170 --> 01:14:40,140
-Chest, breast heat flashes.

526
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:51,640
-Which she says it's quite prominent.

527
01:14:57,140 --> 01:15:16,140
-Skin eruptions, mind sadness, mind sighing, mind desire company when alone.

528
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:34,140
Stomach thirst less, extremities peeling off of nails, mind ailments from bad news.

529
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:47,290
-Itching of course of the sole of the feet you have there, sexual desire diminished,

530
01:15:47,390 --> 01:16:02,040
desire for company, abscesses, sighing, sadness, hypertension. There is also one

531
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:16,540
strong element, let's put there sympathetic or anxiety for others and also sympathetic

532
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,400
and see what happens.

533
01:16:21,060 --> 01:16:38,960
Underline the sympathetic 3 times and anxiety about others put 2, there you'll find

534
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:41,140
Phosphorus quite strong.

535
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:44,440
-80% less.

536
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:50,190
-80% less after Phosphorus. So we don't nee that symptom, we can take it out. What

537
01:16:50,290 --> 01:16:55,940
about the symptom sympathetic, you still maintain 3?

538
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:57,290
-Yes.

539
01:16:59,130 --> 01:17:07,060
-OK. After Phos what did you take?

540
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:16,290
-Nothing. I just took Phos in April 30C.

541
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,450
-After Phos you took any other remedy?

542
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:37,200
-After Phos I took Mag phos in the beginning of February and I took back the Phos in the

543
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:38,300
end of April.

544
01:17:39,550 --> 01:17:44,050
-So the last remedy was Phos.

545
01:17:45,050 --> 01:17:50,420
-And I think maybe it brings up things like last time when I took Phos, I though I'm going

546
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:54,840
to have a heart attack. Every time I take Phos I have problem with my heart.

547
01:17:54,940 --> 01:18:01,170
-Do you drink a lot of water?
-No, I never drink a lot of water.

548
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:13,660
-So you see how easily it can upset because she has a sensitive organism and she is suggestible.

549
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:22,820
This case we call suggestible, she suggests that somebody is sitting next to me,

550
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:27,470
he is taking a remedy, I may be affected. Definitely she can develop symptoms

551
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:38,260
because of that, it's not objective but the belief system is so strong that she can develop.

552
01:18:40,510 --> 01:18:46,160
-One of the things that Phos and Sulphur came up strong in my repertorization, one of

553
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:54,410
the things that I feel is causing her stress, is her irresolution regarding to become more

554
01:18:54,510 --> 01:18:59,260
involved with Homeopathy, in professional level and she mentioned that and so

555
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:06,540
I used the rubric delusions fear giving medicine that would harm others.

556
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:14,290
-Where is such a rubric? Where did you find it?
-Who put that?

557
01:19:29,290 --> 01:19:33,790
-I'll find the source.
-It doesn't matter.

558
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:46,480
-I think the rubric was originally by Kent, I have to look that up to find the source.

559
01:19:53,420 --> 01:19:59,170
-What are the remedies?
-The only remedy is Sulphur.

560
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:06,540
-But this is not true, Baryta carbonica has that, Anacardium has that, Silica has that,

561
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:20,460
Pulsatilla has that. Especially Anacardium, I have seen doctors who even try to take

562
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:29,290
blood and they feel they may harm the patient. They give a little remedy, aspirin maybe

563
01:20:29,310 --> 01:20:37,960
and it was an Anacardium case but this goes to the section of lack of self-confidence.

564
01:20:38,060 --> 01:20:46,440
This is the section which contains this rubric. If you have rubrics like that, you don't rely.

565
01:20:54,960 --> 01:21:03,280
Therefore her case is not clear, as you see, first of all. Secondly we see Phos has taken

566
01:21:03,380 --> 01:20:32,630
as the last remedy, the blood pressure is not controlled, second point.

567
01:21:08,870 --> 01:21:17,800
Third point is that she has developed lately some symptoms more of the Sulphur type

568
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:27,300
and the possibility of Ignatia is always there but as she is sensitive I would not give

569
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:37,110
Ignatia for her at that moment, though she says I' m not interested to live. It's not a matter

570
01:21:37,210 --> 01:21:46,940
of depression yet, it is the beginning, this is more the Sulphur type when we say, with

571
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:53,040
Sulphur indolent, she doesn't want to do anything.

572
01:21:55,040 --> 01:22:04,350
Delusion, gives people something wrong from which they may die.

573
01:22:11,010 --> 01:22:23,180
Therefore we have one more point for Sulphur and she takes a dose of Sulphur quickly

574
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:30,380
now, tonight then see, tomorrow the blood pressure... Who checks the blood pressure?

575
01:22:35,990 --> 01:22:43,920
Now you take it, you have lower blood pressure because Sulphur causes high blood

576
01:22:44,020 --> 01:22:51,500
pressure, then it brings it down as well. When you took it, it was wrong, so you had a

577
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:56,500
proving. Now you need Sulphur you'll see how you will feel.

578
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:59,150
Now finish with this case.
