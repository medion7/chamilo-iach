1
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:38,140
-Very sensitive to cold air, aversion to water, cannot bear to touch it.

2
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:24,040
So if one had prescribed that remedy that syndrome here it looks like this one.

3
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:37,770
A cold remedy, that has vomiting and diarrhea before menses, Ammonium carbonicum, this is.

4
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:47,010
Nobody has mentioned it and neither I gave it.

5
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:54,510
-Why did you give (?)
-I did not.

6
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:14,650
Which is the remedy which is so cold?
-Veratrum album.

7
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:28,820
-Veratrum album. It is a case on which we prescribe on pathology, not on symptomatology

8
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:40,490
but which is so strong that indicates the heart of the remedy which is Veratrum album.

9
00:02:55,330 --> 00:03:04,820
It is not that we went through repertorization but knowing the remedy, not the essence

10
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:11,920
but only local symptoms and general symptoms of the remedy.

11
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:20,570
So where are we now here? We just have the general symptoms of the remedy

12
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:25,720
and local symptoms general, we put these together

13
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:31,080
and see no other remedy except  Ammonium carbo that comes closer.

14
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:37,880
So in my prescription Veratrum album with possibility of Ammonium carbonicum.

15
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:46,280
Dysmenorrhea for how many years?
-19.

16
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:54,130
-Within one month, no other remedy.

17
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,120
(?) we do not prescribe.

18
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:17,950
Sometimes you will see me prescribing on one keynote but before I do that,

19
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:29,950
l have exhausted the whole Materia Medica and see that no other remedy fits. Then I do it.

20
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:39,940
That is the idea, a completely different way of thinking here.

21
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:48,790
We don't have the essence, we don't have enough general symptoms.

22
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:51,150
We don't have local symptoms to indicate.

23
00:04:51,250 --> 00:05:00,080
We do a combination of local and general symptoms and Veratrum album.

24
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:10,900
You look disappointed. These are difficult cases.

25
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:32,060
We have some cases later which are very difficult to find

26
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,920
but these cases are not difficult cases.

27
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:43,820
And if you struggle with such cases then when you go back home,

28
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:50,070
you will see that your cases become much more easy. Do not get disappointed.

29
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,420
There is also one point...

30
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:11,730
I can forgive for not finding the remedy because you do not have real responsibility

31
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,800
at the moment, you are very safe.

32
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:26,260
So it's a different feeling from when you really have the responsibility, it's a different thing.

33
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:32,510
It's much more the mind, much more to the point.

34
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:42,190
That's why most of the people have difficulties of these cases but you are learning quite a lot.

35
00:06:51,120 --> 00:07:09,070
You can read so many cases that are not of that level.

36
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:17,670
So we have learned aspects of Argentum nitricum and Veratrum album and you will not forget this.

37
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:54,320
It says about the heart here, a heart remedy, (?) sensation of heart beating,

38
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:44,910
palpitation from the least exertion. Especially when you (?)

39
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:58,660
Has anybody found that remedy?

40
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:31,330
You suggested Ignatia? Who suggested Ignatia?

41
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:43,840
Who was in favor of Natrum muriaticum? Who suggested other remedies?

42
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,230
-Bryonia.

43
00:09:47,330 --> 00:10:00,990
-Bryonia was good but something was lacking, here it says palpitation tremendous

44
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:05,990
and a heart which affected by cigarette (?)

45
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:10,410
-(?)
-The remedy is (?)

46
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:42,570
What (?) did in that case is that it took away the effect of tobacco

47
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:53,060
which had rearranged the whole system in such a way that it didn't go back.

48
00:10:53,160 --> 00:11:02,340
What we observe is a nosological influence.

49
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:22,410
We have on top of a Natrum muriaticum (?) and understand what is going on.

50
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:37,930
So this person was a Nat mur case (?) with palpitations and all these symptomatology.

51
00:11:45,590 --> 00:12:00,830
There is a stimulation and grief and tobacco and there is a further disorganization

52
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:07,430
of the system and with Nat muriaticum...

53
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,170
The woman that had the problem had to decide.

54
00:12:49,160 --> 00:13:04,160
She is a Nat mur, that's the person and then he still (?) and then here comes (?)

55
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:23,900
It's a different (?) competition is too strong, it aggravates.

56
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:30,820
It's a new state on top of Nat mur.

57
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:41,410
In my experience I found that it is not going to act

58
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,230
You have to find the new layer.

59
00:13:49,570 --> 00:14:01,230
A new layer has come about, a new remedy and you have to face that remedy (?)

60
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:11,340
and then go back in Nat mur condition; then you may repeat Nat mur.

61
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:25,560
So what (?) did, it took away (?) it's a good function, after 3-4 days I repeated Nat mur

62
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:38,310
because what was happening is that she had already antidoted the remedy.

63
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:46,560
So the Nat mur state was already back and on top of that it was created another state.

64
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:54,400
If the Nat mur was not back, if she had not antidote the Nat mur

65
00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:06,510
and it was a bit different in modalities, then most probably the Nat mur would be indicated.

66
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:16,340
I will tell you more to understand.

67
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,580
Here we have a case of Nat mur on top.

68
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:26,660
Underneath it was another layer which is Sepia

69
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:35,810
and perhaps we have another layer Sulphur which will not show so much disturbances.

70
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:41,570
So when you give Nat mur, this layer goes away and we have the possibility

71
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:45,570
to see the Sepia layer manifesting.

72
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:50,810
But if you wait too long or we don't have contact with the patient, the patient feels

73
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:58,150
that he is quite all right and doesn't come back, what happens is he antidotes the treatment.

74
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:03,320
In Nat mur state, that layer which went away first, will come back.

75
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:10,070
That means this layer is the result of the underline predisposition layer.

76
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:16,570
All these underline layers they may be so that Nat mur is the uppermost.

77
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:19,570
You give the remedy, you take it away.

78
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:27,560
If you don't give the Sepia the next remedy, then every time it will have a relapse,

79
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:32,570
most probably you'll have a Nat mur layer.

80
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:41,320
But if you have given Nat mur and Sepia, the Nat mur layer will go away,

81
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:46,660
the Sepia layer will be there and the (?) layer will be here.

82
00:16:47,370 --> 00:17:00,480
You give (?) and Sepia. Here it was state Nat mur antidoted, a new situation.

83
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:10,080
You took away the (?) and Nat mur is there, take Nat mur and you see normal.

84
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:17,230
-What potency you use for (?) ?
-200.

85
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:24,020
-Why you chose (?) ?
-Because this is the Similimum in this case.

86
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:33,680
If you read (?) you will see that the whole picture of the remedy comes very much,

87
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:46,900
a hard remedy and there is a great palpitation and very much aggravated by exertion.

88
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:56,320
What is more important here, what is a keynote, it says a tobacco heart,

89
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:04,660
what this person has said to me, it says I have been smoking a lot yesterday...

90
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,070
-Did you get it from the analysis of the remedy or did you use the Repertory at all?

91
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,080
-No I didn't use the Repertory.

92
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:26,770
-Not even there? In palpitations on tobacco? You have to know the remedies.

93
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:30,460
-Yes you have to know the small remedies.

94
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:45,700
You see the Repertory is better but many times we need to have the information

95
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,950
which is beyond the Repertory and apply it,

96
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:53,700
otherwise if we try to apply the Repertory every time...

97
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,950
Did you give Bryonia in that case? I'm sure.

98
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:04,950
A little bit of change but still a whole syndrome will be there.

99
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:12,050
You may have a little bit of change but the person still (?)

100
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:24,950
The keynote was for me from tobacco poison but it has stimulated through tobacco.

101
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:30,450
(?) has exactly that sensitivity.

102
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:36,190
These persons that are (?) they are affected by tobacco, by smoking cigarettes,

103
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,370
their heart is affected.

104
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:50,610
When you have somebody who claims that if I smoke my heart will be affected,

105
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:53,860
then it's (?).

106
00:19:53,960 --> 00:20:03,960
If he tells you that if I smoke just a little then my head is affected, then what is there?

107
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,880
-Spigelia.

108
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:24,290
-If a person will tell you that if I'm exposed to gases to downtown where there is pollution,

109
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:36,780
then I feel weak with a headache, with hemicrania, with anxiety, all these symptoms come

110
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,620
when they go down town, where there is a lot of exhaust gazes which is the remedy?

111
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:48,140
-Phosphorus?
-No.

112
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:08,530
-You have to remember that because you may find it.

113
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:15,040
You have people being exposed to pollution, again and again

114
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:19,900
and they develop that symptom where there is tremendous hurry feeling inside...
