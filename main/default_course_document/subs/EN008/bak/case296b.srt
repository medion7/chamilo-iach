1
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:29,460
-I was having very deep depression and was thinking whether I want to continue living or not.

2
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:35,210
-Do you want to live now?
-Yes.

3
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:49,630
I want to start with a normal follow up before I tell you my acute symptoms.

4
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:57,780
I received Phosphorus and after taking Phosphorus at home for about 3 weeks

5
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:05,380
I repeatedly had the feeling that I was going to faint any minute but it was only very brief.

6
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:14,530
And also after taking the remedy for some days I had swelling of my eye lids, my upper

7
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:22,630
and lower, it looked a bit like a quick edema but not so strong, it disappeared again.

8
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:31,810
After taking the remedy I had the feeling as if my entire life was running in slow motion.

9
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:38,110
Everything was going on a lot slower than normally, I can not express it any other way

10
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,460
than that everything was in slow motion.

11
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:51,320
-Before, she was in a state of hurriedness?
-Yes always.

12
00:01:51,420 --> 00:02:05,460
-And suddenly this calmed down, slowed down.
-Before I always felt a kind of pressure.

13
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:17,110
For a couple of months I developed an old symptom again, I had my premenstrual syndrome

14
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:23,710
again with pains in the breasts from the ovulation but that also eased off again.

15
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:34,110
What I probably didn't mention last time was that when I jump, I lose urine and

16
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:38,710
that also has ameliorated and I love to jump.

17
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:01,860
My blood pressure also ameliorated, normally I always had a low blood pressure 90-50

18
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:07,300
and for a while I was like 110-60 but now is down again.

19
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:16,940
My psoriasis also aggravated for a while, I had it in places like my scalp, in my ears,

20
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:24,480
around my belly, in the genital area, meaning concealed areas and it had aggravated

21
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:31,190
and in my bellybutton there was a kind of exudation which looked like crystallized honey

22
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:40,530
and when I removed it I could see beneath the exudation in the skin, it had cracks,

23
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:45,970
also in the other areas of the skin was very dry and cracked.

24
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:52,320
In general I became warmer, I always used to be very chilly and that has become better.

25
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:11,570
I developed a wart in my middle finger which stayed for 3 months and then it disappeared again.

26
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:21,710
My energy has ameliorated, when I wake up in the mornings are not that depressive anymore

27
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:26,710
but I also really worked through a lot of things with myself, this time.

28
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:31,060
I also had one dream which I also want to tell you.

29
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,460
One dream I had pretty soon after taking the remedy and I had written to you about it;

30
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:53,230
that was a dream where a voice very clearly told me that I should not be so yielding, submissive.

31
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:02,380
The other dream was a situation where I was lying in a room on a chair similar to the one

32
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,980
I had in the college.

33
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:11,080
I was lying there naked and across for me was a door and on the side was a door.

34
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:15,800
While I was lying there the door opened and in came a girl.

35
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:22,800
I used to go to school with her and in the class she was the most tender, the most shy,

36
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:32,060
the most fragile people and she came and she was just just talking with people and

37
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:40,800
then turn around and left the room again. While awakening I had the feeling, she made it,

38
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,650
she was able to make it.

39
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:52,150
-Actually she, because both is the same, her friend and herself.

40
00:05:54,650 --> 00:06:07,550
Most probably there is an inner feeling of confidence that she went out of depression.

41
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,800
-But it was not her.

42
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:15,580
-Yes but the dream represents the same person, this is a projection of her own image.

43
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:24,830
If you look at the girl with so sensitive and yielding, this girl represented her,

44
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:28,050
it was very similar with her.

45
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:35,400
That which is similar, she said, oh she made it. Is it clear what I say?

46
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:41,500
-After this dream I had to cry for some weeks very often because only after this dream

47
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:48,000
I realized how many things I had suppressed in myself, how many things I have never dared

48
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:55,460
to speak out, how many things never came up and I had to realize that I had to start doing this,

49
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,310
to start speaking out to do this.

50
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:07,710
Many days after the dream, I was walking in my apartment talking to myself in different voices,

51
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:13,160
one part of me said this and this and the other part said no look at it in this way and for many days

52
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,010
I just kept on going.

53
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:23,630
-She had an inner discussion.
-Loud.

54
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,060
-Very good.

55
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:36,300
-And after that I started to write poetry again, I start doing collages, painting and I nearly needed

56
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,800
to do this to express what was going on inside.

57
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,810
-Feelings came back.

58
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:49,460
-Yes and also I gained more self-confidence. It's not so much as I would like it to be

59
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,500
but definitely noticed.

60
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:57,460
People used to say why do you look so self-confident, you are self-confident and I know I made

61
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,720
this impression but I never had the feeling going along with it.

62
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,310
Now I can feel that something happened.

63
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:19,500
And I'm very happy about that. I put more spices in my food again now and I go out to theater,

64
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:29,750
to concerts and so on, I really took up life again but I still have not regained my complete energy,

65
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:33,310
I still feel that I'm easily exhausted.

66
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:41,650
And I sleep very much still, even during the day, all I have to do is lie down and boum...

67
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:57,430
-Now she feels good after sleep?
-Yes, sleep is refreshing.

68
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,900
Now I will have the acute symptoms.
-Yes.

69
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:15,150
-Since last Thursday I developed headaches and also some throat pains.

70
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:41,810
Saturday evening I had quite strong pains and Sunday I barely managed to have breakfast with

71
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,650
a lot of pain in swallowing already.

72
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:54,130
Since Sunday was our free day I thought never mind I just go back to bed, it will do me good

73
00:09:54,230 --> 00:10:02,880
but then within only a few hours, the development on my throat got so intense got so swollen that

74
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,680
I felt I was going to suffocate.

75
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:14,850
It was like a strong pharyngitis, my tongue was burning and I felt that I'm going to suffocate,

76
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:20,650
I felt real fear and as nobody else was around.

77
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:28,880
-Had she ever had a similar condition in the past, so strong?

78
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:40,280
-I can remember having pharyngitis in my life but I can't remember having it ever so acute developing

79
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:44,380
but already in the evening it was ameliorating again.

80
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:53,630
-What I want to know is when it was the last previous pharyngitis of that type?

81
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:10,810
-Long time ago, about 15 years ago. During the day I also noticed rambling development

82
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:20,030
on the abdomen and in the evening I had diarrhea and so I hardly ate anything since then.

83
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:25,530
The only thing I ate this morning was a half banana and I usually drink very much but

84
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:33,710
I can not drink anything, the moment I drink I feel nauseous, so I haven't' taken anything since then.

85
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:38,710
-Yesterday she did not or today?

86
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:50,110
-Hardly anything on both days, yesterday because I couldn't swallow and today because

87
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,710
it makes me feel nauseous.

88
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,740
-Not only nauseous but she has diarrhea.

89
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:04,210
-Diarrhea was only last night, it has gone now.

90
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:24,670
The secretions of the diarrhea were burning and I've been sleeping very much.

91
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:30,590
Yesterday I slept the whole day, I slept the whole night, I came here this morning after one hour

92
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:38,440
I felt so tired and I went back and continued sleeping and I feel very weak.

93
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,090
And I cried a couple of times yesterday just out of desperation because of this weakness

94
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:57,090
coming so suddenly and so intensely; usually I'm the type that props myself up again and continue

95
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:00,390
and now I just couldn't, very weak.

96
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:06,190
-The thirst is not there or she is afraid to drink?

97
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,340
-Thirst is less than usual, I would like to drink because my mouth is dry but the minute

98
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,940
I take one sip and it reaches my stomach, I get nauseous.

99
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:29,190
-And she doesn't have much flesh to lose.

100
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:40,590
-I definitely lost about 2 kilos in this 1,5 days and also my urine has a certain smell.

101
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:51,690
It smells like I have ketone I'm pretty sure I have that in my urine right now, that's the smell.

102
00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:02,840
-I asked her about her menses because they were scanty, as I have seen here and that was a point

103
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:08,450
of argument with Phosphorus most probably, with the class.

104
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:23,340
I was saying it doesn't matter, the class was saying it matters, so therefore I asked her how are

105
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:31,190
the menses now and then she remembered something changed and that's why we came back.

106
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:38,780
-My menstruation remained exactly as it was, always very little.

107
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,780
Once I had a bleeding in between my menses in February and so immediately I went

108
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:52,040
to see the gynecologist and she then discovered that I have Chlamydia, which I don't know

109
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:56,970
where they are coming from  because I haven't infected myself within the last months.

110
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:03,370
-She took antibiotics?

111
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:08,160
-No, the doctor recommended antibiotics but I didn't want to take them and up to now

112
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,230
I haven't done nothing at all.

113
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:17,470
-There are any symptoms concerning that? More itching, discharge, leucorrhea?

114
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:27,050
-About one month after she diagnosed the Chlamydia, I had a little bit of leucorrhea not much.

115
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:33,710
Sometimes I go jogging in the morning and afterwards there is some but otherwise no.

116
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:40,710
Sometimes but that's only due to the fact that I'm really paying attention that sometimes I feel

117
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:44,310
some pain in my joints.

118
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:49,460
-Did she have Chlamydia in the past where she had been treated

119
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,750
and she has ever been treated for leucorrhea?

120
00:15:53,510 --> 00:16:00,220
-I only had leucorrhea once after my pregnancy but that was not treated, it disappeared.

121
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:03,720
-Thank you.

122
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:30,320
It's very simple now, we don't have to say many things about this case.

123
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:48,320
Again it is interesting to see whether this was a case with really deep depression and why?

124
00:16:51,570 --> 00:17:01,070
In which level you would place this situation?

125
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:16,570
-Top 3 going to 2?
-Somebody else. Middle 3, he said.

126
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:29,250
-Originally the case was very deep because there was loss of will to live, that was border suicide

127
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:37,300
or tendencies so I would classify it 3 going to 4, prior to a deeper physical pathology probably.

128
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:45,220
Now since the Phosphorus, it's middle 3 and she is having acutes moving to the 2,

129
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,020
where she can have acutes.

130
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:59,990
-That's correct. What he says is when the person does not want to live, we have a deep depression.

131
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:17,230
Yet a very deep depression with no will to live could be actually 3 level and almost 4,

132
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:35,130
yet if we see that the remedy is quite clear, we suspect, as I was suspecting when I was

133
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:44,730
analyzing the case, that this case was actually uppermost 3 level going to 2.

134
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:50,730
In spite of the fact that she said also I don't have the will to live.

135
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:59,920
She didn't exactly say I want to commit suicide, I want to die, there was not that deep depression

136
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,670
that we see the darkness of the depression.

137
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:10,220
So though the words are the same, I don't want to live the intensity of the depression is different,

138
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:19,820
the depth of the depression is different and that's why also everybody says, you don't look...

139
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:28,470
This is very important for you, for observation. The deep depressed people,

140
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,670
they look also depressed.

141
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:40,630
They can not hide it. You see little subtle signs that we have to evaluate a depression and to say,

142
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:45,490
well you will see with the right remedy.

143
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:57,380
Subtle things like this where anybody else would not take care but what I was interested very much

144
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,730
with her, it was her dreams.

145
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:13,290
The dreams which came show actually a psychotherapeutic process going on without

146
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:20,040
the interference of any psychotherapist of course, a total psychotherapeutic process

147
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:32,870
which she did herself and the dream was showing that she was projecting this girl who was having all

148
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:42,230
the qualities of her, she saw her coming and she said, she made it.

149
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:51,370
That was herself actually and the deeper feeling finally after all this self-psychotherapy,

150
00:20:51,470 --> 00:21:03,720
you did a self-psychotherapy actually, it is the seal that she is out of the depression.

151
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:10,870
She made it and now the interesting thing is that we start with the acutes.

152
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:17,620
How deep is the acute? I told you the acutes when they come at this level,

153
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,870
in number 2 level the acutes

154
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:30,220
will be very strong and most probably you will have to treat because they are quite life threatening.

155
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:34,880
She is not in life threatening situation but she is suffering.

156
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:40,720
And the problem we have at this moment is what shall we do in this case?

157
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:48,980
Where is she going? What is happening in this organism under the acute?

158
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,690
You remember we have certain rules and certain principles which guide us.

159
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:07,680
As we said, the main rule is, if the case if life threatening you treat no matter what.

160
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:15,160
That's rule number 1. Rule number 2, if it is on first level, you treat or you don't treat it

161
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,660
depends on the intensity etc.

162
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:28,330
When you come to group 3, after you get out of the group 3, the acutes are going to be strong.

163
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,930
And she is going through a strong acute.

164
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:40,330
So the decisions that we have to pass is, shall we give a remedy for her acute

165
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:44,430
or shall we repeat the Phosphorus?

166
00:22:47,180 --> 00:23:03,000
If we have clear picture of an acute remedy, Mercury clear, Arsenicum clear, then we give the acute

167
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:11,500
and we say another rule, if you don't have a clear picture and there is a serious situation,

168
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,850
we repeat the chronic remedy.

169
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:28,600
In which case is she? Is she developing a clear picture of another remedy?

170
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:36,300
Margaret was putting also the repertorisation.

171
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:47,410
-I believe there isn't enough information to get a really clear picture but I have a question.

172
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:52,410
If the constitution of the chronic remedy, Phosphorus was repeated, would then she get

173
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:58,160
another acute with stronger symptoms so that a more clear picture would come out

174
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,760
of another remedy?

175
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,240
-I didn't understand your question.

176
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,990
If now we give Phosphorus, she is treated and she is better...

177
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:11,520
-She is treated and she is better and then she develops another...

178
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:18,340
-You are asking me and whoever...

179
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:30,320
-For myself I don't see enough to give an acute, Arsenicum or Mercury, not enough

180
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:33,420
and so for myself I would repeat the Phosphorus.

181
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:46,180
-But there is a need for repeating or we say carry on, because we saw in previous cases

182
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,030
they went through.

183
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,680
He went 3 times in bronchitis and he pushed it without any medication.

184
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:58,100
In this case, if we push what is going to happen?

185
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:05,950
If we tell her, no medicine at all because we have 3 possibilities, 1 acute, 2 the chronic

186
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:16,950
and 3 no medication, can we suspect what is going to happen to her with no medication?

187
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:25,860
Can we suspect what is going to happen after repeating the chronic or here in this case

188
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:32,390
I will tell you, this is one of the worse cases to make a mistake.

189
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:40,610
To make a mistake especially giving another remedy, you suspect this is an Arsenicum case

190
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:46,010
or Sulphur, Mercury, whatever and you start giving and she will go worse and

191
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:52,540
then you give Stannum and she goes worse and you give Muriatic acid and she goes worse

192
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,890
and by the end of your treatment she is back into depression.

193
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:05,960
You see for those who have some experience, they can appreciate what I'm saying.

194
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,710
Those who do not, they have to keep in mind and remember it.

195
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,400
-We definitely continue to give Phosphorus in this case but if I wouldn't be sure,

196
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,960
I would give Phosphorus in a low potency to be on the safe side.

197
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:31,210
-Phosphorus on a low potency, that is a good idea.

198
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:42,360
-George I think Phosphorus has most of her acute symptoms, if you look at the Phosphorus,

199
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,240
only the... is not there.

200
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:06,960
-I would like to hear who would give another remedy? Nobody.

201
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:17,460
Who would give the same potency Phosphorus 1M?

202
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,160
Who would give the same remedy in low potency?

203
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:33,880
Who would say, let's wait one more day?

204
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:47,710
I play jokes with you, don't forget.

205
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:53,610
I say one day so some people will raise their hands, one day she is not going to die,

206
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:59,710
so we can wait but what I'm gong to say is opposite.

207
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:14,360
The question that you had to ask to yourself is, is she by the force of the acute, is she going to

208
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,460
a state of relapse?

209
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:24,860
Do you suspect that this case is going into a state of relapse that means the organism is

210
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:37,960
pushing down more and more, is losing energy, in which case you prevent it by giving the remedy

211
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:46,710
or do you feel that she can make it, we let her.

212
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:57,360
She will not relapse. In this case, as she is now , it is very doubtful if we leave her she will recover,

213
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:06,210
she may recover in 4,5,6 days but she will go slowly in her energy.

214
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:16,690
After reaching bottom she will come little, little after 5, 6 days. If she picks up OK but

215
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:19,940
there is a probability that it will stay long.

216
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:29,690
It will stay low energy, perhaps not with the deep depression, where she wants to die but

217
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:31,440
a kind of a depression.

218
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:38,550
When you don't have energy, you have either depression or irritability.

219
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,710
What shall we do?

220
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:55,350
And posing these questions that you have to ask in every case you have to evaluate at this moment

221
00:29:55,450 --> 00:30:03,960
where is she. Her organism is strong or is falling?

222
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:10,600
-Besides that she said she is very weak, I think we have to take into consideration that soon we all

223
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:16,620
fly home and this is a very strong factor from the outside which I think we should keep in mind.

224
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:23,040
-She is always practical in her application.
-Yes.

225
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:44,190
I have said that each remedy acts on different levels of pathology, different levels of pathology

226
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:56,940
and here we have depression. Here also we have depression here also we have depression,

227
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,270
here also we have depression, here also we have depression.

228
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:06,520
We call it depression, all this is depression and the remedy which covers all these depressions

229
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:09,120
is for instance Nat. mur.

230
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:22,620
Another case, we have cancer, here we have cancer, here, here...

231
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:33,270
When we deal with depression of that level, we don't expect such reactions,

232
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:39,270
we expect some amelioration, here and there and other things and developing and little bit this

233
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:48,860
and that and fears are coming and then irritability is coming, there is a process before we bring

234
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:54,860
this depression up to that level, where we finally give either the same remedy...

235
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,460
Maybe in repeating the remedy will raise the state of the depression.

236
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:09,360
She may be depressed after this, you let her and she has a relapse.

237
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:21,790
Here is the Phosphorus and the depression of what she had, it was here.

238
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:36,040
And it will go there. As a relapse it will go, it will not be as deep but quality wise it will be similar,

239
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:43,190
then she needs a repetition here and then again, another push and again.

240
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:52,440
The same way as if you understood with the Ignatia cases, that we said, we wait

241
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:57,790
whenever they need some Ignatia they repeat more.

242
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:08,790
Everything has to be very precise, very clear in order to take a person from here to health.

243
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:14,290
Usually the allopaths take them to eternity.

244
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:27,540
So you have to have in mind, there are cancers that are curable.

245
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:37,960
Calcarea carbonica can cure the uppermost cancer layer.

246
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:42,840
There are types of cancer that we know they are cured.

247
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:47,340
And we say, I gave a dose of Sulphur, Phosphorus can cure.

248
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:55,440
These are few cases which are standing very high but you go to the most aggressive cancer, forget it.

249
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,500
The only thing you can do is a palliation.

250
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:05,420
Calcar. carb. here, Calc. carb. here, it's the same remedy.

251
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:15,670
The remedy does not change but the pathology is underneath so strong that it will go up

252
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:17,020
and back again.

253
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:27,190
Here, in these depressions, you battle, it comes up and down, up and down...

254
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:33,190
it past a level. You don't see this kind.

255
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:50,720
We can have grades of energy and here we have the group. She was here, uppermost level,

256
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:58,260
she goes here, she has much more energy, she reaches very high here, she gets an acute,

257
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,570
she goes down in energy.

258
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:17,320
How far it can go to energy not passing through this level, unless we allow it to happen.

259
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:29,140
Finally she may have a kind of deep depletion of energy, which the organism can not bring it out,

260
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:37,380
it reaches up to there, then here we have the depression again, not perhaps as much

261
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,130
but still quite strong.

262
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:49,810
I believe that she will not reach that state because I hope we'll treat the acute correctly.

263
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:02,310
-As far as I remember she also had myoma and I would like to know what happened to them.

264
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,560
-I can't remember.

265
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:14,560
-I have a very small myoma which is 1,7 cm in diameter and this is still existing.

266
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:29,050
-Let us say it is a question and you want to know what to expect. What to expect in group

267
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:38,880
3 is different than what to expect in group 1. In group 1 the myoma has to be reduced.

268
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:46,980
In group 3 it has to be increased. You understand?

269
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:06,230
It somatises the disease.

270
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:18,460
She gets an infection and she says I do not have any chance of being infected.

271
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:24,240
What happened? The only thing it changed was the organism.

272
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:35,310
Actually in this particular case what changed is the Ph of the uterus.

273
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:51,460
The acid-alkaline environment of the uterus, that is what changed and allowed the development of the

274
00:37:51,560 --> 00:38:04,210
microbes etc. which are already existing in these areas. So she says, I had never the

275
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:09,310
chance to be infected, what is this? This is what it is.

276
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:19,090
-What in her particular case concerns the level of health in this acute?

277
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,840
What is concerning you that she may relapse?

278
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:38,230
-The energy that goes so low, I am afraid she may go into a kind of a relapse.

279
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:46,210
If it was the pain, I wouldn't care. If it is the diarrhea, I don't care. The energy goes so low ...

280
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:53,210
Of course under an acute everybody gets low energy, there is no question but why she gets

281
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:59,060
the low energy in the end? Do you see the difference?

282
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:07,080
You have an acute, if I have an acute I go into coma almost but in the beginning.

283
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:16,560
But if I see after I go into the acute, then I go down, then I better take the remedy.

284
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:25,560
In this case we are allowed and justified to repeat the remedy.

285
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:31,290
-What about the aggravation of the psoriasis?

286
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:44,030
-Very good sign. The aggravation of psoriasis, the myoma if there is, later on it will be

287
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:55,630

294
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:17,380
If you want to become a homeopath, you have to understand fully this theory.
