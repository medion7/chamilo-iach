1
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:37,720
-You have no information, no paper, nothing?

2
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:43,610
-I'll tell you everything. Let me just with the pathology first, I'll give you the whole list.

3
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,680
-Tell us what is the problem now.

4
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:06,930
-It's high blood pressure which I had previously in my pregnancies, I used to have

5
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:20,430
when I gave birth it was 220-190 in the labor and I was each pregnancy 3 months in the hospital

6
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:31,680
as a high risk. Then after the first pregnancy I took pills and the high blood pressure stayed,

7
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:37,680
I'm talking about birth control pills. In the second pregnancy I had the same story again

8
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:43,180
and then I decided that maybe it's from the pills and when I'm pregnant

9
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,680
and when I'm taking pills is the same story and I had an IUD

10
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:54,620
and the blood pressure dropped to 220-80 which was OK all the time.

11
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:06,020
When I didn't take pills it was 120-80 which is normal and last few years I started having

12
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:14,020
problems with my period and the doctor advised me to take pills again and I forgot, it was

13
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:21,510
20 years ago, I forgot and I took it about 6 months, then I didn't feel good, I went to

14
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:26,520
a doctor to do a normal check-up and I found out that I had very high blood pressure

15
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:37,800
like 160,170-120 and he wanted to give me medications and I said, no way, I'm doing that

16
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:47,300
and I took a remedy but the remedy story started before because I started having the problem

17
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:55,370
of the period and gain water, I really felt bad, everything bad, stomach, diarrhea.

18
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,270
-With the pills?

19
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:11,510
-Before the pill. When I was about 42 I started having a lot of problems, everything came back

20
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:19,590
like all my pathology from young age came back and the worse feeling was that

21
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:25,440
I felt sick and I can't stand feeling sick.

22
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,100
-You felt that you were ill, not sick like vomiting?

23
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:37,840
-Like vomiting, I never vomit but I felt nausea all the times and headaches, diarrheas and

24
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:46,090
everything was off. Then I started trying with vitamins, because I study naturopathy,

25
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:52,370
so I have a lot of practitioners around. Everybody gives you something to help you and

26
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:59,220
I was very down on my mental. Everything was completely down.

27
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:24,370
Then about 3,5 years ago I got Lachesis 1M, I didn't know what remedy it was and it was

28
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:30,790
like water, like I didn't do nothing, nothing changed not to bad, not to right.

29
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:51,200
Then about 9 months later I received Argentum nitricum 7C every day, I felt good mentally

30
00:04:51,300 --> 00:05:01,950
but within 2 weeks I start getting paranoid, I could feel what people think from another country

31
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:10,200
and so sensitive that it made crazy and crying, I felt that I'm going off the edge

32
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,550
and I took lots of chocolates and coffee to antidote it.

33
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,200
-How long it lasted this feeling of being sensitive.

34
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:33,450
-About 3 weeks till I stopped it, I just told the homeopath I can't stand it and he saw it.

35
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,700
It was in a seminar we went to Ireland.

36
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,950
-First you felt good with Argentum nitricum?

37
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:46,200
-Yes, not bad, I didn't feel bad, I was happy to take it every day, I enjoy it.

38
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:54,450
It wasn't really that it changed the symptoms, at the beginning when I started I had more diarrhea

39
00:05:54,550 --> 00:06:01,830
and problems and a headache and then I took it every day, every day 7C and

40
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:12,830
then I felt OK it dropped a little bit diarrhea and everything. It's still been 5 times the day

41
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:20,580
but then when I start feeling quite good, then I became crazy, people didn't recognize me,

42
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:26,870
my eyes when I looked at myself in the mirror, I didn't recognize me, you know the way you look,

43
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:33,110
you look crazy, it was really a mental case. I really felt that I'm going off the edge

44
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:40,450
and I was crying for everything, I felt like people talking, really paranoia.

45
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:51,190
People talking about me, doing things against me, a paranoia case, I have a paranoia case at home,

46
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:58,290
so I know it, my brother has schizophrenic paranoia, I have the picture.

47
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,540
So I stopped it.

48
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,520
-It was the fear maybe.

49
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:13,520
-Of course there is a fear when you behave like this, I behaved obsessive, talking all the time

50
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:19,850
and the worse thing was the feeling inside. In the end I found out that it was true

51
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:27,100
but I exaggerated, it was exaggerating the things that happened, the things were true,

52
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:33,680
no imagination but you can make from a little mouse a big elephant

53
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:38,900
and normally I don't care about these things, I just pass through it and I don't care.

54
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,990
-When it was this incident?

55
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:49,730
-2 years ago exactly in June. Then immediately I stopped it, I stopped taking it,

56
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:56,230
I took coffee, chocolate, I just packed chocolates and coffee, which I hate coffee, I don't drink

57
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:01,330
I have aggravation from coffee, I never drink coffee and it's stopped.

58
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:13,980
Then I still felt bad, not as before, that was in June and in December I went to a homeopath

59
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:27,980
to see what happened to me in June and he gave me Mercury and I didn't feel ease

60
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:34,230
about the Mercury because all the symptoms are opposite to me and I told him

61
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:40,330
I don't think it's me but whatever, I didn't read the Mercury, only what I knew from Mercury

62
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:48,920
from before. And as I took it within half an hour I had hot flashes and

63
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:58,330
I felt like somebody is watching me, like penetrating me from the back, I had to put a scarf

64
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:05,080
on my shoulders and then I felt good. It was very funny and I asked him, is it possible when

65
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:11,580
you take a remedy you open like this, like you don't have covers, like everybody can penetrate you

66
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:21,750
and he said, yes it could be. Next morning I had very inner sore here and here in

67
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:31,170
the tender places, like burning and it was half a day I remember lying in bed reading a book

68
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:40,420
and suddenly I start choking, I felt like I had a lump behind my throat, burning as if something

69
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:47,520
you have to take out and within less than a hour I had a flu, high fever.

70
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:58,920
It came so sudden and I felt so bad like very strong bronchitis and nightmares the whole night,

71
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:06,420
nightmares and choking and sweating, I was wet and normally I don't get fever at all,

72
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:20,520
for me 37 years I never get fever at all and I felt so sick for about a month and a half.

73
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:27,420
I've never been so sick in my life and if I tell you my pathology you will understand what I passed before

74
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:37,420
I was diarrheas and the worse was the lung area, every night I was choking

75
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:43,180
and coughing, it's like shocking yourself and the nightmares.

76
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:50,750
Normally for me the night is the best time, I sleep good, I dream, I just put my head on the pillow,

77
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:55,200
I'm not there. I can wake up for a second, my husband talks to me and

78
00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:02,000
I answer him and I'm gone and it was very bad for me because it ruined my life, I couldn't

79
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:13,080
function during the day. I don't like to lie sick, normally when I'm sick even if I have flu

80
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:21,830
I always go to work, I don't stay in bed, so with this thing happened I stayed maybe 2-3 days in bed

81
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,680
and I just continued my life.

82
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:40,620
I had decongestion in my head and deaf, I was completely deaf and that stays till today.

83
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:52,100
I feel like in the airplane, the ears are blocked. Now I got used to it, it's already a year and a half

84
00:11:54,430 --> 00:12:01,420
but all the time you feel the things going around you and you blurt, that's crazy.

85
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:08,170
That's left and after a month and a half, two months I started sleeping again normal

86
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:16,180
with normal dreams, not crazy dreams and actually that's what happened.

87
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:38,580
The pathology from a kid, since I was a child I had quite severe illness, as a child

88
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:48,830
I was a very nice kid, eating good, no bottle with the glass and what I asked from my mother what

89
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:56,330
did I do, she said, you played with newspapers, you ate them and the only problem I had

90
00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:00,300
was with the ears, I had infections to my ears.

91
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:07,210
Two and a half years old I had mastoiditis they took out on the right ear the bone,

92
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:15,050
when I was 7 everybody in the house had Asiatic flu and I had asthma attack.

93
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:26,550
They gave me (?) and I had a shock with urticaria on the body and I was in a hospital for 3 weeks,

94
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:32,800
I came out with scarlatina and since then I had very severe asthma attack,

95
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,050
I couldn't do nothing, I couldn't even walk to the toilet.

96
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,070
-Since then you mean till today?

97
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:48,800
-No, after giving birth it finished, I don't have it anymore, I used to call myself doing like this,

98
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:54,800
getting inside myself, calming myself, otherwise I would have completely chocked

99
00:13:54,900 --> 00:14:05,080
but always came and started with some kind of allergy, if somebody shaked a blanket the

100
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:12,580
house dust and I started (?) immediately or if I laughed too much I started (?) and

101
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:19,500
from this (?) nose running and then asthma and then pneumonia and then sequence.

102
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:26,050
And when I was 11 this pneumonia turned to atelectasis

103
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:36,480
 when the lungs stuck to each other collapsed lungs

104
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,730
-Atelectasis.

105
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:49,050
-And I was quite a long time in the hospital with very strong antibiotics and physiotherapy

106
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:56,050
they wanted to cut a piece of the lung but my mother didn't let them, so it went like this.

107
00:14:56,150 --> 00:15:05,050
When I was 15 I started bleeding from the colon, I still have very severe colds, asthma and

108
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:15,550
pneumonias and then I had bleeding in the stool and diarrheas. It started with diarrheas

109
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:27,800
then bleeding by the time I was 17,5 I had very strong attacks of ulcerative colitis,

110
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:36,800
I'm talking about 16 times the day buckets of blood, getting blood and taking out blood,

111
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:51,340
5 hemoglobin and I dropped to 42 kilos, which today I'm 90, less than half from now.

112
00:15:54,140 --> 00:16:06,510
They tried for a year, I was in a hospital for a year, at the beginning they gave me cortisone,

113
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:16,500
injections intravenously then because I got urticaria from the injections, then pills,

114
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:23,110
then I moved to another hospital because it was getting down and down and they gave me Imuran.

115
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:29,050
Afterwards I heard that I was the first in the world who tried it.

116
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:43,170
So I took 1 year only cortisone and then I left home.

117
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,170
-What year was that?

118
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:56,420
-1968,67. I was 17,5 and when I left the hospital I went to study in Jerusalem,

119
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:02,170
 I went out of the house and study in Jerusalem for 1 year and slowly...

120
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,500
-What did you study?

121
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:14,260
-Art, painting. I studied since I was 14,15, I studied in the high school 4 years and

122
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:24,270
I did Academy and slowly, slowly it finished the colitis. I still have diarrheas a little bit

123
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:33,510
3-5 times the day but it didn't disturb me and then I studied in Jerusalem and next year I

124
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:40,750
then went to London to study and I still had very severe asthma attacks in London.

125
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,170
-What you were taking during this time for medication?

126
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:51,080
-Nothing, I just finished with the cortisone and Imuran everything stabilized.

127
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:54,910
-When the asthma started?
-Nothing, I never took nothing.

128
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:00,670
-You were rocked like this.

129
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:07,160
-And get calm, just not to be hysterical because in the minute that you get frightened,

130
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:11,180
I don't know I used to take care of myself instinctively;

131
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:18,820
I didn't like this gas and inhalers and all this.

132
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:25,780
-You mean that never during the asthma period you took any drugs?

133
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:36,610
-Nothing. They used to give me some kind of aminophylline but I hated it, antibiotics yes,

134
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:41,970
a lot of antibiotics because it used to go through the lungs.

135
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:16,570
I think what changed the ulcerative colitis was my understanding because I used to sit with doctors

136
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:21,700
 the they used to explain me what's wrong because I wanted to know why I have it,

137
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:27,940
explain me how does it work and they said that usually it's a psychomatic problem,

138
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:39,610
you take everything inside, I was very quiet, I used to take care of animals, I liked animals and books,

139
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:52,210
I was busy raising little birds catching from everywhere and cats, dogs, that's all and nature.

140
00:19:53,960 --> 00:20:02,860
I was living like intuitively, naturally, I didn't mind what's going on around

141
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:09,920
I had my books later on where I can read and was inside very romantic books.

142
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:19,170
-Until what age did you live this way?
-Till I went to high school.

143
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,670
-That means 12?

144
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:28,180
-Yes, afterwards I also collected every dog in the street, till now I do, my kids do,

145
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:35,770
it's the whole family problem now, to pick up every poor thing, people also.

146
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:44,920
-And you say you were closed to yourself until the age of 12?

147
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:55,920
-Till I had the ulcerative colitis, then I found out that I take everything in, I was a kid that

148
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:04,750
when somebody looked at me a little bit funny and I thought they are thinking a bad thought about me,

149
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:14,750
I start crying. Even if they didn't say, the feeling, I cry till now for every beautiful thing

150
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:25,000
that I see, every story that is moving, music, mainly my husband always laughed at me,

151
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:33,850
he said you cry also in Buffy and Jody, this story, everything that moves me.

152
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:37,920
-Easily cry.

153
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:44,250
-The tears come out, it's nothing I can do, it's something that moves with me.

154
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:47,250
-That's crying started when?

155
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:54,480
-Always, as a child yes, I would get offended very easily and

156
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:58,200
especially if something wrong was done to me.

157
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:06,170
-Tell me from homeopathic remedies, what remedies you took and what effect they had?

158
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:13,620
-I took this Mercury which gave me a horrible thing, afterwards I wrote everything down

159
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:22,200
a month and a half, then I went to Boericke to look, it was like a golden proving, it was so funny.

160
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:37,950
Then I didn't take anything, that was 3 years ago, then a year ago I started having cramps,

161
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:47,140
I started having cramp in my throat like chocking, suddenly.

162
00:22:53,220 --> 00:23:10,700
I think left side, it looks like it goes through the neck into the head, I had one incident a year before

163
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:17,900
that my kids or my husband made me crazy with an argument, normally I don't argue at all,

164
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:27,040
I like harmony around, I give them what they want and my husband is more,

165
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:31,040
they are afraid of him, not from, from me they can get everything.

166
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:41,320
I don't know what happened, I was before my period, I was very angry and I had like a knife

167
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:49,740
going through all my right side of the body to the brain and then I didn't feel half of the face,

168
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:57,240
I went to the hospital and they told me that it's nothing, I was afraid that it's a stroke,

169
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:03,740
they said it's because I was angry, they gave me some tranquilizer and it passed.

170
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:11,740
A year later this cramp started but nothing to do with anything, out of the blue, if I was dressing

171
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:19,740
or in the class if I write something, it started actually when I was studying and

172
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:33,900
then cramps in my legs, then cramps in my calves, it started like a cramp but I can sit, I can walk,

173
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:43,150
I can go downstairs, it starts and then the whole leg I can't stand on it, it's very painful

174
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:53,900
and paralyzed. Then I started taking Magnesium and Zinc and Vitamin B6 and it stopped,

175
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,400
I never had that again till I stopped taking this every day, then I started having it again.

176
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:04,040
Then I used to have in my bag few of those, I used to take them half an hour later.

177
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:08,040
-Made from homeopathic or allopathic?
-No, vitamins.

178
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,790
-Where they contain Magnesium?

179
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:22,040
-Magnesium, Zinc and B6. Somebody told me try it, so I tried it and it worked, I took it every day

180
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:27,790
for a few months and I never had cramps again. Then I fed up, I said how long

181
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:34,290
I'm going to take these vitamins and then occasionally when I had, it used to come here

182
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:44,800
and then another leg and then here and here. All kind of funny places.

183
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:58,040
Then I took Calcarea phosphorica and I was so scared of having again proving or anything,

184
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:10,540
I took C30, it didn't do nothing but I thought it's OK for me and then 4 months later

185
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:19,640
I had courage and I took 200, sorry Calcarea sulphurica, I always mix them.

186
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:23,560
When I have to say Sulphur, I say Phosphorus.

187
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:45,960
Then a few months later still I didn't feel good, I took 200, again it didn't do much good

188
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:55,710
then a very good friend of mine had very high blood pressure and she went into coma

189
00:26:55,810 --> 00:27:20,210
she had brain damage and died. Then I was really scared, it was really shock for me.

190
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:27,960
Till then I didn't care about the high blood pressure, I will go over it, I'll go along with it

191
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:33,240
but when she died, we were sitting with her in the hospital and I couldn't do nothing

192
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:38,220
because I found out only a week after, because at the beginning we could give her some

193
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:47,560
homeopathic remedy to save her, I felt really bad, really depressed and my blood pressure went up.

194
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:53,400
I checked it, after this incident I start checking, then I had the guts

195
00:27:53,500 --> 00:28:03,650
and I ordered myself Calcarea sulph 1M and I took it and since then I start feeling better.

196
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,600
-You order Calc sulph and finally it worked on what?

197
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:16,150
-It worked on some things, on some pathologies I had.

198
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:17,710
-Have you taken Calc carbonica?

199
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:28,220
-No, only Calc sulp I forgot to tell you that after the second birth I had the caesarian cut

200
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,710
which they didn't give me antibiotics, they didn't cover me with antibiotics,

201
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:41,980
they put me on special group and I had really big infection and they had to cut the stomach again

202
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:52,880
and I had to stay a month in the hospital and they found all kind of germs inside, they gave me

203
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:59,210
antibiotics and after a month I went home with open stomach, pouring in all kind of stuff

204
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:09,960
and since then I had a problem in my right lower, a special spot.

205
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,500
-Your appendicitis is out?

206
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:21,800
-No, it was not the appendicitis, it was more up, like a cramp, like a hot knife and

207
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:29,300
whenever I just move, I can't do exercise for instance, it's like a nerve stuck inside a muscle,

208
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:36,880
that kind of feeling. Whenever you do a movement that you are not used to suddenly it's like a knife.

209
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:50,150
The worse was when I was in my period, the days after it starts it starts hurting

210
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:59,220
and continue for 10 days and it was unbearable, some months I couldn't move from lying to sitting.

211
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:12,980
The problem was when I used the muscles of the stomach from lying to sitting,

212
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:22,270
from sitting to standing. That, the last 3 months has gone. If I do like this,

213
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:30,230
I feel something because I always felt something till it came, it used to be like having something there

214
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,660
but bearable but then in the period...

215
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,660
-You never had been examined by some doctor?

216
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:47,410
-They did ultrasound, once they saw something white many years ago, so they said it's

217
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:55,910
probably a myoma hanging out, then they didn't see nothing, then when it was really...

218
00:30:56,010 --> 00:31:02,780
it was unbearable, I couldn't stand it any longer about 6 months ago, they wanted to do

219
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:09,280
laparoscopy, then I said no thank you and I ran out, I'm not going to touch anything.

220
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:19,810
Like for instance for the colon I had to do checks ups all the years because it's already 27 years

221
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:23,810
and all the time they are sending me letters to go and check. I said no way, as long as it's OK

222
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:32,110
I'm not putting anything in me, forget about it. So they said you can get cancer,

223
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:39,870
leave me in my cancer alone and I'll do whatever I feel like and I never checked it again.

224
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:49,110
Only in the pregnancy, the first pregnancy I had a little bit bleeding, my stomach is very sensitive,

225
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:54,360
if I'm in stress but my work is very stressful.

226
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,630
-What is your work?

227
00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:03,530
-I'm self-employed, I have my own office, we send volunteers to Israel to work to kibbutz with people

228
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:11,780
and their problems but always you have the stress.

229
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:17,030
-Like a social work.
-Yes.

230
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:22,330
-And you do well with people?
-I'm the best in Israel.

231
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:25,480
-No problem?
-No problem at all.

232
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:32,280
-Since childhood or after 12...
-No, when my had the ulcerative colitis.

233
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:43,480
-After the age of 19 about? When this change took place? From being introverted to be extroverted?

234
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,760
-Yes, I decided.

235
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:50,910
-You decided yourself that you have to bring out your emotions, otherwise you will be very sick

236
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,900
and then you did it.

237
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,420
-Yes, I did it and I don't care and even now when people look at me sometimes because I tell

238
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:07,520
everything, I don't like hurting people, I wouldn't do anything to hurt somebody's feelings,

239
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:15,780
sometimes it puts me in a very awkward position because people hurt me

240
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:23,000
and I wouldn't give it back, I wouldn't insult. That's what my father told me, don't do bad things

241
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:31,250
to people that you don't want them to do it to you. So I don't hurt people intentionally

242
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:39,760
even if somebody did something bad to me, I always go to this side.

243
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:47,840
-But here is a kind of controversy because you said that in your family you like peace

244
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:58,590
you will not go into a conflict and you pointed out that your husband is more aggressive.

245
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:04,090
-No, he is not aggressive at all, he is the softest person you ever met, if somebody will

246
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:14,040
rape his daughter wouldn't do anything to him. He is even more peacemakers than I am.

247
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,540
-But you said that the children are afraid of him.

248
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:25,540
-Yes because he gives them everything and he knows where the limit is and they know it.

249
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,000
-So he will be angry?

250
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:32,340
-Sometimes he did things that they made me crazy like if they go against him,

251
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:36,540
he said if you don't like it, you can leave the house and they take their things and they go.

252
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:41,750
I start crying and running after them and he knows that he made a mistake because

253
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:48,450
these things you don't say to kids, sometimes you have the impulse to say things but...

254
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:55,250
-What I want to understand is you don't suppress your anger anymore or your feelings?

255
00:34:55,350 --> 00:35:09,110
-No, I don't suppress, I'm not impulsive as I used to be, I'm still very emotional

256
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:19,790
but the logic thing is together. Even if I let myself I wouldn't be here at all because

257
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:33,290
as I grew up as a child, it pushed up more than the ground could go to my dreams, to my paintings,

258
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:40,500
I used to do things with animals but that was my love, being in nature, animals, reading books

259
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:45,980
living in a different world and if I would have let it... I think my husband is the one

260
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:52,980
who put me on the ground because he is very logical, he laughed to things like this.

261
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,280
Even Homeopathy he is now OK.

262
00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:00,730
-What is your husband profession?

263
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:08,310
-He works in the Israeli TV, he does all the things for electronic.

264
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:09,310
-He is not a doctor?

265
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:15,990
-No, he is not, he wanted to be a film director but he also compromised.

266
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,230
-Can you drink milk?

267
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:26,150
-I like milk, I don't do it because it's no good for my...All these I put on the last 4 years

268
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:37,650
since I start studying I put 20 kilos and it annoys me a lot, I feel so ugly.

269
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:41,900
-You put easily weight?

270
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:52,170
-I put it slowly, very slowly during these years but I can't get rid of it, I retain water.

271
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:58,630
Now I start the diet which I think it's good for me and I lost 5 kilos, it's the first time I lost

272
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:05,890
something, it's the addict to hydrocarbons and it works fabulously for me, slowly, slowly

273
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:23,220
but it works and I felt very bad about it. Before I took the Calc sulp, I was a nice girl

274
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:32,470
I felt good, I like beautiful things, the harmony and beauty played a lot and I felt so ugly,

275
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:38,970
so horrible. Till now I feel it disturbs me, otherwise I wouldn't talk about diets and things,

276
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,150
it bothers me.

277
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:48,970
-Do you feel more the cold, the heat?

278
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:58,720
-I'm very hot. If I look back, I was sensitive to cold and sensitive to heat but to cold more.

279
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:05,720
The last few years maybe it's because of the menopause and things like this, I'm dying

280
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:15,470
not from the heat, from the humidity plus heat. Normally I'm very dry and I never sweat

281
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:19,400
and I never drink, I hate drinking.

282
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,550
-Drinking water?

283
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:28,800
-I hate it, I can't drink water like this, I always have to put some lemon or something but I hate it.

284
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:35,800
If you don't remind me I can drink maybe 1 glass the day because I know that you need to drink.

285
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:45,050
On the other hand, the last few months I'm very dried from 9 o'clock at night in bed very dry,

286
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:52,150
not thirsty but dry, so I have to drink something to wet my mouth.

287
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:04,800
The only thing I hate, it makes me completely crazy is when I sweat in a sticky way.

288
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:14,640
In Israel, in Tel Aviv is very humid and the minute it starts getting hot, you sweat and I feel so...

289
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:24,740
my sweat is funny. It goes from the head, like this, like a shower of freezing cold sweat,

290
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:30,090
it could be the hottest day and the stickiest day but the sweat will be very cold

291
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:38,130
the same when I have bronchitis, what comes out the mucus is freezing cold.

292
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:46,240
It's very funny because normally you would think what comes from inside is hot, it's cold.

293
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:54,890
Now another thing that bothers me now, the last 9 months, I didn't pay attention to it

294
00:39:54,990 --> 00:40:10,140
 till I flew the last flight and then I flew here, a few hours like 3-4 hours after I start

295
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:20,390
having pain in the right lung, like a knife, very severe pain because I'm used to pain,

296
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:28,610
I'm not sensitive to pain at a certain point.

297
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:32,740
-Which point, can you show me your lumbar region?

298
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:41,740
-Here, exactly here.
-On the lower scapula?

299
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:57,240
-No, it's under the scapula, here. For many years I have sometimes a feeling like a hand

300
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:12,070
to the same place, I thought that maybe is the blood vessels, like in sleeping, when a part

301
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:18,830
is sleeping you feel a numbness. It comes and goes and in the same place now I have

302
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:26,770
this pain but it's inside the lung, it's completely inside. When you deep breathe is like a

303
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:38,990
knife but every step which I do with the right leg is a knife. It started in October, we went

304
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:48,670
to a seminar in Germany and I had very severe flu before that. So I thought it's from that.

305
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:53,820
The thing is not the suspiciousness, I'm naive and I believe everybody, they signed my life away

306
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,820
a few years ago, I signed to somebody and they nearly took my house and I didn't know

307
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:05,570
I'm signing a collateral, they told me something else, just to help somebody, I couldn't say no,

308
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:13,040
I'm very naive. At work for instance, people come and they don't have money,

309
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:20,210
I always give the money, I never see the money back but I keep giving, so I'm not that suspicious.

310
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:27,460
I'm cautious sometimes but not enough but always when something happens, I can tell you

311
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:33,080
what is going to happen and that's what my husband says, I'm suspicious. If he does

312
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:38,840
something and I see the coincidence, what is going to be after, I say don't do that

313
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:42,620
because you lose your money, don't do that because something like this will happen.

314
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:50,420
And he says, you see the black thing about it but in the end it happens as I said

315
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:56,580
and he laughs but I don't think as suspicious because I can see also the good thing out of it.

316
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:05,170
It's just that I'm thinking ahead, I'm a very good organizer, I found out after start working

317
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:11,670
that I can organize everything, everything I do, I do it and I close it with all the little details

318
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:18,670
and it's very important for me that it will be closed with all the little details, nothing will fall.

319
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:23,520
So I think it has to do with that, not suspicious, just be prepared.

320
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,170
-What other remedies you have taken?

321
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:38,180
-That's all, the Calc sulp for that, now the cramps coming but after a few minutes going by

322
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:47,380
themselves, the last month but the high blood pressure still on and this pain here

323
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:52,200
bothers me a lot, it stays for about 3 days, I can't move.

324
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:26,200
I'm sensitive to lots of things.

325
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:42,350
-Two times you went crazy, it's a matter of expression or it's a matter of facts?

326
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:50,100
-When I have before my period and in my period a very... Normally I talk quite a lot

327
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:59,600
but before menses and in my senses I just can't stop, I find myself talking too much and

328
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:11,850
I feel that people, it's also my imagination, my husband tells me and I can see it.

329
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:13,800
-So you are very talkative before?

330
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:24,270
-Very talkative, very excited, about 1 day before and during.

331
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:35,770
This happened during this period, when I was like this, it was the normal situation

332
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:51,010
which went 100 times more and very sensitive like you've seen yesterday but that's only before

333
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:54,610
menses, 1-2 days.

334
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:13,360
I have another thing which bothers me, since I remember myself I can't sleep in the afternoon.

335
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:21,760
If I go to sleep from 1-2 o'clock fine but if I go to sleep and wake up around evening

336
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:24,370
I'm so nauseated and a headache.

337
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:31,540
-You are sick from a nap in the afternoon.

338
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:43,510
-So sick from a nap in the afternoon, since I was a kid. Very, very strong. I just hold myself

339
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:50,450
not to go to sleep, I just hold myself. Anyway I don't do it, only Friday or Saturday

340
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:56,930
when everybody does it, I like cooking, I like entertaining people, I like to give them food,

341
00:47:57,030 --> 00:48:01,530
I find a lot of things to do and I like to be busy all the time.

342
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,760
I can go on till 1-2 o'clock at night.

343
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:10,510
-Which is the best time for you?
-Morning is bad, I can't t wake up in the morning.

344
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:19,030
-The worst? When you feel tired, depressed?

345
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:26,010
-I don't feel depressed normally, I don't, I just don't think about bad things, I take a book

346
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:32,510
and go over it but I found out that in the morning it's hard for me to wake up.

347
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:38,760
I wake up and then I give myself another hour, I am lazy, I have two workers in my office,

348
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:46,260
so I give myself morning time, I like to be relaxed in the morning, I like to sleep longer but

349
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:52,760
at night I can stay up 2-3 o'clock, sometimes when I reach 4 o'clock I can't fall asleep.

350
00:48:52,860 --> 00:49:06,270
Since I took this Calc sulph I can't sleep at night. I found out that I'm reading a book and

351
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:14,250
a kind of wake myself, when I sit like this, I wake myself not to sleep, I don't know why

352
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:20,500
and then I force myself to sleep at 4 o'clock because I know that I can't go to work in the morning.

353
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:27,250
If I don't sleep proper for 7 hours, I'm just like this in the day time.

354
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:32,340
-Can you tell me about the diseases of your parents?

355
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:47,830
-My father died from... when he was 57 he had diabetes which ended with insulin in the end

356
00:49:47,930 --> 00:50:04,830
and he had angina, then he had high blood pressure, then prostate, then 2 heart attacks

357
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:17,850
which they brought him to life twice, then he had a stroke and another stroke.

358
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:28,500
He died from heart attack because the day before he had a lot of retaining water in his lungs,

359
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:34,580
so he died from heart attack. He was 71 and he was a very strong person,

360
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:40,580
he'd never been sick till he had this diabetes, he was a very strong person and all the doctors

361
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:45,580
that with the pathology he had now, he should have died long ago.

362
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:53,410
One of the heart attacks he had was 12 minutes dead and then suddenly he came back to life

363
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:57,910
and the next day he ate sandwich and the doctor said to check his heart because

364
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:06,020
it was funny that it was functioning normal, it should be a brain damage or something.

365
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:16,310
My mother was a very strong woman, now she is 73, she had colitis, not ulcerative colitis

366
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:27,160
she is very strong person, now she starts having funny blood pressure, sometimes it's up.

367
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:48,390
And she has arthritis now. My grandmother from my mother side had also heart problems.

368
00:51:48,490 --> 00:51:54,890
My grand father from my mother side also heart problems and my grand father from my father side

369
00:51:54,990 --> 00:52:01,240
died when he was 42, I think also from heart problems or stroke.

370
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:16,530
-Do you have any fears?

371
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:28,260
-That something will happen to my kids. If just a thought coming into my mind that they are sick

372
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:37,060
or heights or I used to have dreams about waves coming, covering us and the kids,

373
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:47,580
my heart would just stop. Just a stupid thought for a minute. That's the worse fear I have.

374
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:57,760
Other fears? I wouldn't like to stay without any money, I like to be secure.

375
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:04,140
I always go back to my house, I have a house where I have a little bit savings but

376
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:10,810
I can also spend without thinking, I'm a big spender, if I know that I have the money to spend

377
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:18,310
I spend and I don't care, I don't count anything, I give, I spend on others, I don't care but

378
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:24,810
I always need the security. For instance I wouldn't stop my office before I have another

379
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:31,560
practice to have money coming, even if I'm fed up with something, I always run it.

380
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:41,060
Because it's a source of security. Fears from heights you mean?

381
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,590
-Yes, heights, dark.

382
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:51,890
-Dark no, animals no, I love them all except snakes, I don't like to be bitten by one but

383
00:53:51,990 --> 00:54:01,770
I won't run away, I will go around. They disgust me but when I was a kid I had snakes and frogs,

384
00:54:01,870 --> 00:54:03,710
they are even more disgusting.

385
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:06,940
-Mice?

386
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:17,940
-Mice not, I'm not afraid of them, if they are whites no problem. The big mice I think they

387
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:27,730
can bite you, so I wouldn't touch them. Heights? Sometimes I look from high down and it

388
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:34,230
makes me a little bit dizzy and I wouldn't cross a rocking bridge, if there is a bridge too

389
00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:44,200
high, I wouldn't cross it. Not when I was a kid, not because it's more logical.

390
00:54:56,310 --> 00:55:01,460
-With the time that the sun sets?
-It's beautiful.

391
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:03,210
-You like this time?

392
00:55:03,310 --> 00:55:10,710
-Yes, I like it especially when you are on the beach, I love open air, I'm craving for open air,

393
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:18,540
in a room that is stuffy I'm going nuts. I like to feel the breeze, even the draft when I'm sweat

394
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:22,800
I go to the air condition and do like this and everybody say, you will be sick,

395
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:25,140
you will be sick, no way I love it.

396
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:28,710
-Your nails are strong?

397
00:55:28,810 --> 00:55:40,560
-They are breaking a little bit. I never broke any bone.

398
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:46,210
-Do you have special kind of food that you like, dislike?

399
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:58,210
-Yes, I like meat with fat but only if it's on the fire, I'm not that crazy about meat otherwise

400
00:55:58,310 --> 00:56:06,540
I'm crazy about sea food, if it's lobster, shrimps, everything just name it. Meat I like only if

401
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,140
there is fat in the steak.

402
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:11,570
-Do you eat pork?

403
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:23,630
-Yes with fat. The pork itself I don't like, I like its fat better than the pork. But when I took

404
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:35,380
the Argen nitric I felt disgusted from the fat. I couldn't touch it, that's good for my diet,

405
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:44,070
not meat, not butter, it really kept me off. I like butter, I put quite a nice portion of butter

406
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:58,290
on the bread, I like fruits only if it's unripe, sour, I don't like sweet food. I go usually more

407
00:56:58,390 --> 00:57:08,030
to the sour side of food, if I eat meat I like it sweet and sour, this way.

408
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:11,320
-But unripe fruits like green?

409
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:17,430
-If I can pick an apple which is green or tomatoes if they are still green a little bit.

410
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:22,280
-You like it?
-Yes, I like the sour taste, that's nice.

411
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:29,930
-Do you bath in the sea here in Alonissos.

412
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:37,270
-No, usually the last two years I don't go into the sea. I just lie in the beach to get

413
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:46,620
sun but also with an umbrella on top, I don't like to stay to direct sun. I suffer from that.

414
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:51,100
-And you don't go inside? Why?

415
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:56,850
-You have stones and it's very cold, if not I would have gone in. I like it, I love it, I feel so

416
00:57:56,950 --> 00:58:14,530
good inside, fantastic and when I'm singing I also feel happy inside. A lot of happiness.

417
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:29,680
What do I hate? Raw onions make me belch and apples, I found out that apples give me

418
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:36,840
heartburn normally I like every food. I'm very good eater but I wouldn't

419
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:47,940
eat in the sake of eating everything, I like good food, cooked good.

420
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:05,170
Sweets I eat only before my menses. I can eat the whole pack of chocolate, just before

421
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:08,600
menses, normally I'm not a sweet eater.

422
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:17,150
-What position do you sleep in bed?

423
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:31,600
-Only on the right side. When I turn to the left I feel awkward, if I'm on my stomach I choke.

424
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:36,380
-In abdomen, do you ever sleep on abdomen?
-I feel choked.

425
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:41,330
-But if you didn't feel choked, do you prefer?

426
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:50,080
-Only when I had stomach aches, I used to put a pillow and lie on it but normally like this

427
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:54,900
like a baby on the right side with the hand underneath the pillow.

428
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:08,260
-Have you ever been hurt emotionally?
-Many times.

429
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:13,660
-In your relations?

430
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:19,240
-When I was very sick, I had a boyfriend and his parents took him away?

431
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:24,080
-You were born in Israel?
-Yes.

432
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:26,330
-How do you speak so well English?

433
01:00:26,430 --> 01:00:34,070
-I studied in England, arts. So these 3 years gave me the base and after 11 years I start

434
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:44,570
working with people from all over the world, so it came back. I remember a situation from

435
01:00:44,670 --> 01:00:52,170
my childhood when I was very hurt, I still remember it, when I was in the first class.

436
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:56,430
-Because you were not first in the class?

437
01:00:57,210 --> 01:01:09,330
-No, I tell you the story. I have my grand mother in the USA and she sent me water colors

438
01:01:09,430 --> 01:01:13,570
and there was another girl who had this one in the class and one day I came to the class

439
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:22,340
and she said that her purple color is missing and I had mine and the teacher told me to

440
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:31,830
give her the little pen and I said no, it's mine, maybe she forgot hers at home, I didn't

441
01:01:31,930 --> 01:01:39,320
steal. And she said, no you took it away from her, so she took it away from me and I went

442
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:47,820
home crying and my mother came the next day and the next day she brought the pencil

443
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:55,570
it was at home and then they said, OK sorry but it doesn't work this way, I was 5,5 or 6

444
01:01:55,670 --> 01:02:01,830
years old. I never came into this class, I moved class. That I remember, the whole story

445
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:08,910
even the table, the color. I don't remember many things from my childhood. I remember

446
01:02:09,010 --> 01:02:14,610
another incident when I was 2,5 years old because I remember the house, that's the age

447
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:30,080
that we left the house, my father found a porcupine and he brought it to the terrace and

448
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:36,830
he gave him milk, I even remember which glass it was. That I remember and another

449
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:44,330
incidence, a happy one, when my uncle came from Switzerland and they brought some

450
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:49,940
chocolate, I remember it was waffle with liqueur inside the same age as this and

451
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:57,570
it was singing to me ... I remember even the song that she was singing and another incidence,

452
01:02:58,870 --> 01:03:11,270
I remember screaming like hell. When they had to take the stitches out, they decided that it's not

453
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:18,020
nice, so they cut it alive again, they just cut the whole place and stitch it again when I

454
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:25,270
was without any anesthesia. That I checked with my mother because I said, listen I

455
01:03:25,370 --> 01:03:34,770
remember a scene like this, me screaming. And she explained me that it could be this

456
01:03:34,870 --> 01:03:41,520
incidence, then I remember me running after dogs and cats and collecting birds...

457
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:49,550
-What I mean do you remember having being hurt by a relationship?

458
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:50,370
-Of course.

459
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:53,610
-Like boyfriend who left you?

460
01:03:55,700 --> 01:04:01,360
-That was already when I had ulcerative colitis, when I was very sick at the hospital.

461
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:09,270
His parents bought him a car and sent him abroad because they decided that I have

462
01:04:09,370 --> 01:04:16,950
cancer and I'm going to die, then he came back and he brought me all kind of art books

463
01:04:17,050 --> 01:04:24,440
and presents, it was beautiful to see him back but I found out that in the book he cut the

464
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:32,770
first page, so I looked and I saw in love and everything. They made him cut even what he

465
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:42,020
wrote on the book for me and then the next day came and said, listen while I was abroad

466
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:47,300
you went with somebody else, you were unfaithful to me. I was only 5 days of the

467
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:54,770
hospital. I knew it's not true, in the beginning he was so convinced he said, maybe I didn't

468
01:04:54,870 --> 01:05:02,110
know what I'm doing, that's crazy and then I told him that it's because of his parents.

469
01:05:02,210 --> 01:05:09,110
I just broke up, he wanted me to meet him in the street, I'm not a married woman to go

470
01:05:09,210 --> 01:05:19,140
and hide, unless you want me, go away. It hurts me and it relapses for 2 months my

471
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:27,140
colitis but in the end I was strong, I said that's it, enough. Then I decided to change, not

472
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:36,890
to get hurt so much. Of course every girl has a boyfriend that they break but the

473
01:05:36,990 --> 01:05:45,040
relationship was not that deep then, not involved with sex, just emotions.

474
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:58,190
-Any other incident? You met your husband and you married? You have 2 children?

475
01:05:58,290 --> 01:06:01,440
-I had before a boyfriend that I loved very much.

476
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:03,520
-And what happened? He died?

477
01:06:03,620 --> 01:06:12,720
-No, he continued studying, I met my husband and I decided, my mother decided that it's

478
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:18,270
better to marry somebody who loves you more than you love him.

479
01:06:22,370 --> 01:06:28,620
-How is your sexual desire? High, low, medium?

480
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:41,370
-I think medium. It depends, sometimes more, I found out that after 40 I was more

481
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:49,030
feeling sexy than I was after having the children. After having the children, I didn't like it.

482
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:50,540
Well I never said no.

483
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:55,150
-You became aware of sex at the age of?

484
01:06:55,250 --> 01:07:03,620
-21? I had a boyfriend since I was 15 but 21. They told me in England that they are going

485
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:12,500
to make a show, the only virgin 13 upwards, in London, in hippy times.

486
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:22,380
-But you became aware of sexual matters at what age?

487
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:31,120
-15. When I had a boyfriend and things like this. I never wanted to sleep with anybody.

488
01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:44,200
It was important for me, the romantic way. That what always matters more, even today

489
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:51,200
I wouldn't have a love affair, just to sleep with somebody, I have to have the emotions

490
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:54,300
involved very deeply before I do that.

491
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:14,530
-Would you say till now that in the evening you are more or less energetic?

492
01:08:14,630 --> 01:08:26,780
-More, from about 10-11 o'clock I'm OK, I can work full, I don't feel that time passes when

493
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:33,280
I'm working, if I don't do nothing I would be like this the whole day long. I need to do

494
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:40,970
things, I have to have something that interests me, I feel asleep if something bores me.

495
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:42,550
I just drop.

496
01:08:43,970 --> 01:08:53,140
-But when you feel more energy?
-I think in the evening, night.

497
01:08:53,560 --> 01:09:09,390
-Evening onwards you feel better.
-Yes much better. Thank you.
