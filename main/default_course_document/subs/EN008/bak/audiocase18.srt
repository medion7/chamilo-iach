1
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:38,570
I wanted to show you a case, I'll make the introduction.

2
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:43,080
I will not show the whole case because we don't have time.

3
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,580
I will make only the introduction, you are not going to show anything,

4
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,410
only the pictures maybe.

5
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:56,910
I will tell you only the introduction of the case I'm going to

6
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,670
 present to you tomorrow morning.

7
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:09,420
Two years ago when I went to give a seminar in Germany,

8
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,170
 as soon as I arrived in Germany,

9
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,410
one of the doctors of the Center that organized the seminars,

10
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:21,360
 said George I have a big problem with my mother.

11
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,340
I said what it is?

12
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,330
She said she is in the hospital and

13
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:38,830
they are preparing to cut both her legs from high up the thighs.

14
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:49,410
I said why? Because there is gangrene, there is no flow of blood.

15
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:55,910
When are they going to cut the legs? She said on Tuesday.

16
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:01,420
It was, if I remember well, Thursday or Friday.

17
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:14,160
So from Thursday or Friday till Tuesday we had to show some effect on legs that

18
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:24,920
they were black and gangrenous.

19
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:37,660
Because she was in the Center, I knew her, I said OK we'll go to the hospital.

20
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:44,160
We went to the hospital and we got some pictures,

21
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,370
not a video but some pictures of her legs.

22
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:55,580
Of course she could not walk anymore, there was no flow of blood,

23
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:04,330
the legs were dead...

24
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:10,870
Can you show some pictures?

25
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:27,170
You don't have the pictures. OK, show the report.

26
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:33,000
I gave the report to the class and I gave the symptomatology in the class and

27
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:53,500
you will hear that and then you will see the legs.

28
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:59,250
This is a good example of usually what they say about Homeopathy.

29
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:03,500
"Homeopathy is good for common colds".

30
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:09,990
Yes little things, if you have a pimple here it's good.

31
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:18,740
I want to inform you of what I saw yesterday.

32
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:34,750
We enter the room and we see this lady lying in bed, covered from the waist downwards

33
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:52,000
with quite heavy blankets.

34
00:04:52,100 --> 00:05:04,080
From the waist upwards she only wears something for her breast. She is uncovered.

35
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:18,400
Immediately as I enter the room, I see she is doing like that with her fingers.

36
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:25,900
There is a great restlessness in the fingers.

37
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:34,600
In the meantime her daughter has told me that she has flashes of heat.

38
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:39,320
I said where? In the upper part.

39
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:52,570
Then I uncover the blanket to see the situation in the legs and it is within one week that

40
00:05:52,670 --> 00:06:06,320
this condition is developed. Can you show the pictures?

41
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:17,510
You see the black spots?

42
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:26,690
The right side is more affected, the right leg is more affected than the left.

43
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:43,490
Can you give the next picture?

44
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:51,740
The tissues are there totally destroyed, totally black, as you see.

45
00:06:51,840 --> 00:07:03,250
No signs of real alive inflammation, just dead tissues that become black.

46
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:11,000
There is no pain, she does not complain. She says she feels nothing in the legs.

47
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:23,750
She has no feeling in the legs.

48
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:55,150
The idea is that they have to amputate her from higher up in the thighs, very soon.

49
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:59,100
-When she walked last time?

50
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:08,100
-That condition has come about the last week as I have been told, very fast.

51
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,150
-No pain?

52
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:13,400
-At this moment no pain at all.

53
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,240
-How old is she?

54
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:19,240
-She is 70 years old.

55
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,240
-She has diabetes?

56
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:40,040
-No diabetes. It is a case of severe arteritis.

57
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,890
-She is smoker?

58
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,190
-Never said her daughter.

59
00:08:53,870 --> 00:09:06,100
She loved her family, loved her house and her husband,

60
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,110
 this is information I get from the daughter.

61
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:21,110
She was rather a chilly person, constipated all her life almost.

62
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:46,120
-Constipated all the time, cold feet all the time.

63
00:09:47,620 --> 00:10:01,510
This case I have brought to show you in order to show you that

64
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:24,270
there are certain emergency cases, certain emergency states in which you may be...

65
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:46,470
There are certain emergency cases, very urgent for which you may be justified sometimes

66
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:51,050
to give more than one remedy.

67
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:57,020
I want to show you such cases as well.

68
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:09,370
In such cases you cannot really make out the exact remedy, if you can it's OK.

69
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:14,770
So if the woman yesterday was an emergency case and it's a matter of life and

70
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:27,520
death like this, it's a matter of losing both her legs from higher up...

71
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,770
It's a very, very urgent case.

72
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,110
And you are not certain about the remedy,

73
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:53,350
 you may be justified to give a second one at the same time.

74
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:59,600
But always of course not just give 2-3 remedies just like that,

75
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:06,860
always after great study and consideration of the case.

76
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:19,850
In this case I give to the class in Germany and you also listen to what I had observed

77
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:22,890
in order to prescribe.

78
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:32,210
I hope you studied this case yesterday and today you will be able to prescribe.

79
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:36,360
Can you give a little bit more information?

80
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:40,600
-Four years ago it started with an inflammation of the right ankle and

81
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:48,610
 it was treated by antibiotics. The situation got worse and worse back then.

82
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:54,360
She had to go to the hospital and they detected an occlusion of the arterior

83
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:59,690
in the popliteal.

84
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:10,590
 And when they did a chest X-ray by accident they found a carcinoma and

85
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:14,590
 cancer of the left lower lung.

86
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:22,140
There was an operation three months later which she overcame quite well.

87
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,870
The situation of the right leg was quite well, she had to take aspirin daily,

88
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:34,830
she could walk but she had some pains in the right leg.

89
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:40,400
About four weeks ago she had mycosis of the right toe nail and

90
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:50,540
 the practitioner doctor extracted the nail.

91
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,800
Then she developed an inflammation beginning from the

92
00:13:54,900 --> 00:14:05,630
 right ankle up to the right lower leg to the knee. Half of the lower leg.

93
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:11,880
She was again treated by antibiotics and reacted with an allergic reaction of the

94
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:22,370
antibiotics. After that there was a total occlusion of the arterior tibialis.

95
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:33,900
So they first tried the lysis therapy with drugs and also tried surgically to get the artery

96
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,650
reopened but this didn't succeed and then they implanted a bypass from

97
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:44,140
the femoral to the tibialis arterior.

98
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:52,890
She also received infusions of certain drugs, Prostavasin, which opens the arteries but

99
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:57,890
that lasted only for four days.

100
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:05,900
After that her leg turned white, pale and sweaty.

101
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,390
At the same time the situation on the left leg got worse,

102
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:15,890
the tips of the toes turned blue and black.

103
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:19,400
 I saw her in that situation about one week ago.

104
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:25,840
She was very sensitive to pain and to touch, she sometimes took off the cover and

105
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:29,590
then put it on again, put it off again...

106
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:38,560
I gave her the remedy Secale in a potency D4 three times daily.

107
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:47,030
After that she got reduced the pain medications, the pain killers, the blood flow got better,

108
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:52,930
the toes became warmer on the left side. The only thing that stayed was the discoloration

109
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:57,430
of the left second toe.

110
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:04,430
A couple of days later again I came to her and I gave her Secale in 200 and 1M,

111
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:13,760
 a potency mixed in water. There was a good development for about one and a half days.

112
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:18,270
At the same time she tried to find a bed in the hospital here in Celle because

113
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:23,430
 before the mother was far away and I could not see her daily.

114
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:30,930
She succeeded, just yesterday she was transferred from the other hospital to here,

115
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:37,510
so I can see her daily and watch the development.

116
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:48,100
-When I see her, I see the leg but that leg is totally dry, there is no perspiration at all

117
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,600
and it is cold.

118
00:16:51,700 --> 00:17:07,340
I ask the doctor to open the Repertory and to see the first symptoms.

119
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:17,420
I asked her to see discoloration black.

120
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:25,950
The next symptom I asked her to see what was?

121
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:39,030
It was impressive for me that her cheeks were very red, exceptionally red.

122
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:46,390
I asked her whether she has always that type of redness in the cheeks and

123
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:50,550
she said yes, it was not an accidental thing at that moment.

124
00:17:50,650 --> 00:18:05,800
So I asked her to see this symptom as well and then she said that she was having

125
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:12,000
flashes of heat. She showed from here upwards.

126
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:20,010
So I asked her to look flashes of heat in chest.

127
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:34,010
Then I asked whether she is thirsty and if you look at your Repertory you will know why

128
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:41,800
I ask whether she is thirsty and she said she is thirst less.

129
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:53,550
Then of course I put it constitutional, I used the constipation, as she was constipated all

130
00:18:53,650 --> 00:19:11,800
along and I take it into consideration and cold feet as well.

131
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:16,290
I asked her whether she is eating the fat and she said no, she is not eating the fat,

132
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:20,090
she has an aversion to fat.

133
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:25,840
As you could hear, everything possible was done from the allopathic point of view.

134
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:35,340
They tried everything, to open the arteries through surgery and Medicine and through

135
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:44,960
different other things and also some homeopathic medicines were given.

136
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:56,700
The end result of all that is that on Tuesday, it is Thursday,

137
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:07,950
she is going to be amputated on Tuesday.

138
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:11,700
I have to act in three days.

139
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:18,200
In three days we must show to the hospital, to everybody, to her also,

140
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:29,210
she is also a medical doctor the daughter but especially to the hospital people to hold back.

141
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:33,450
So until Monday evening we have the possibility.

142
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:42,340
Fri-Sat-Sun and Mon are 4 days that we have to show some effect in this lady.

143
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,330
In the meantime of course the arteries are completely...

144
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:54,090
It's a specific case where we see a great development.

145
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:58,830
This state has developed in the last 10 days.

146
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:03,590
The arteries tend to close and they do everything not to close.

147
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:13,840
They inject, they try to open the arteries. The arteries close.

148
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:17,590
This is the tendency of the organism.

149
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:25,840
So I consider her suffering from a genetic kind of

150
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:34,420
 predisposition towards this kind of element.

151
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:42,170
I know it is a very serious case.

152
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:53,170
I have treated similar cases, even older women, with great success, not as severe,

153
00:21:53,270 --> 00:22:06,920
because she had gangrene spots higher from the knee.

154
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:16,920
It is a quite severe case, so what shall we do?

155
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:27,270
Somebody came to me and said I put together three symptoms that you gave yesterday

156
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:34,920
and this is the remedy I found. I said yes this is correct.

157
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,670
This is the idea with Homeopathy.

158
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:44,680
Take essential things, rely on essential things.

159
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:55,420
Do not distract the information, do not interfere with the information.

160
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:15,670
Essential things are very important where you know you can rely upon.

161
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:20,670
You can go on and ask question and questions and finally give the wrong remedy and

162
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:29,850
of course she will be amputated.

163
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:43,510
So what were the three essentials things that you heard in the beginning yesterday?

164
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:56,500
Restlessness of fingers, it was impressive. What it shows?

165
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:07,260
Is it natural that we'll do like that?

166
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,750
-No.

167
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:18,760
-Watch this. She was sitting immovable but doing like this, she was talking to me, giving

168
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:22,340
answers but she would go on like that.

169
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,840
-Numbness.

170
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:47,890
-If it was numbness what she would do? She would do like this. This is numbness.

171
00:24:47,990 --> 00:25:04,640
This is restlessness coming from most probably inner anxiety.

172
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:21,300
This is an interpretation but I do not even need that.

173
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:28,550
You can go and look restlessness of the fingers, look in the Repertory.

174
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:41,700
Restlessness of fingers, of hands. Kali bromatum and Tarentula and then Hyoscyamus,

175
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,940
Alumina, Arsenicum italics.

176
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:49,190
Show me now gangrene. Arsenicum, Tarentula and Vipera.

177
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:53,030
You don't have gangrene in extremities?

178
00:25:56,870 --> 00:26:08,300
-We have lower limbs gangrene, capital Arsenicum, Lachesis and Secale.

179
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,770
Secale had been given, Veratrum, Vipera, Plumbum.

180
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:22,010
Now you have looked these two things in your Repertory and what you have seen is a

181
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:33,010
lady who is hot in the upper and cold in the lower, what is the remedy?

182
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:48,010
There are remedies that have different temperature in different parts of the body

183
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:51,850
like the Belladonna.

184
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:58,020
Belladonna is burning heat here and very cold in the extremities.

185
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,270
Is this a Belladonna case?

186
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:06,010
-No.

187
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:09,160
-OK, another remedy?

188
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:19,150
-Arsenicum.

189
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:26,700
-Arsenicum has a hot head and wants to be fanned.

190
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:36,530
In the classic books also Arsenicum is appearing as a remedy which is while it is

191
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:45,790
covered in the body, the upper part and especially the head wants to be fanned.

192
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:51,280
This is typical of Arsenicum.

193
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:58,540
Another remedy that wants to be fanned in all kinds of elements is Carbo vegetabilis,

194
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:08,530
it wants to be fanned. But Carbo vegetabilis will not be covered with five blankets.

195
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:15,200
And then the restlessness in the hands...

196
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:18,900
Why the restlessness in this case?

197
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,400
-Fear.

198
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:28,980
-Because of anxiety, of fear, she is going to be amputated.

199
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:35,950
She is in the hospital waiting for the operation and she is immovable.

200
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:42,450
You cannot say restlessness, moving all the time but you have to be observant,

201
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:47,950
very observant before you can prescribe correctly.

202
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:56,400
In one of the seminars I had in Alonissos, one of the doctors, an elder one,

203
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,950
 they call me at 12 o'clock in the night,

204
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:07,450
 he is on the island and they say he has a heart emphract.

205
00:29:07,550 --> 02:00:30,540
He has severe pain, he had recurrent angina pain but this time...
