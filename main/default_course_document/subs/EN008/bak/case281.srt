1
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:30,180
-Tell us what are your problems?
-I had a cough for many years, very hard cough.

2
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:42,760
-Many years?
-Yes, 25 years but not all the time but very often.

3
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,660
-Are you now on crisis?

4
00:00:49,960 --> 00:01:06,160
-Maybe in a way but I have all of a sudden colds, I take colds very easily since my childhood.

5
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:13,910
-And the cold starts from the nose, eyes?
-Yes from the nose to the chest.

6
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:21,910
-And travels fast to the chest, one day, two days?

7
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:30,110
-Fast. This time actually two days. Other times it could start a week before

8
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:38,840
and then calms down. But when I was a child it was not a cough, it was a cold.

9
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,830
The cough started when I was in my first pregnancy.

10
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:51,830
I coughed 2-3 first months, I was quite afraid to lose the baby but I didn't.

11
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,080
I coughed and coughed.

12
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:03,330
-You were in danger of losing the baby because of the cough and the pressure but you did not.

13
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:09,080
This was the first time when the cough started?
-I think so.

14
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:16,080
-But before you used to get colds very easily.
-Yes very easily and a lot of coryza.

15
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,280
-Did you have tuberculosis in young age?

16
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:29,090
-My mother had before I was born. And I was positive.

17
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,840
-What remedies have you taken?

18
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:50,250
-The first one was 15 years ago, Pulsatilla and it helps my stomach for 1 year.

19
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,740
I think the next was Tuberculinum.

20
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,250
-What potency?
-I think from 200 to 10M.

21
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,240
-Do you have any effect from that?

22
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:11,490
-I'm looking [doctor's name] for homeopath, I could [doctor's name] he give it to me

23
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,940
but I read it 2 years ago.

24
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:20,420
I think it was some effect but he changed the remedy, I think I got Sulphur,

25
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,300
I don't know why.

26
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,550
-This is the remedy after Tuberculinum, Sulphur. What other remedies he gave you?

27
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:42,630
-Then he gave me Thuja 1M and Medorrhinum 1M and he waited for 2 months

28
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,300
and then I got Pulsatilla again.

29
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:49,240
-The second time did you have any effect from Pulsatilla?

30
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,080
-No.

31
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:55,450
-What was the potency the first time?
-200.

32
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:59,470
-Second time?
-1M.

33
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:07,470
-No other remedies? During the colds what do you take?

34
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:18,710
-In autumn here I tried Hepar Sulphur. I had it with me, it was D30.

35
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,360
-What happened?
-Nothing.

36
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:29,860
-By that time you have another cold?
-Yes, immediately when I came here it started.

37
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:37,110
-But let me understand, give me an idea. You have a cold and a cough.

38
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:45,110
You have cold and then cough. The cough is all the time, you get a cold, the cough becomes worse.

39
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:48,360
Is that the situation?
-Yes, that is the situation.

40
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:55,610
-Coughing, coughing, coughing, you get cold then it becomes very much worse and then

41
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:03,110
you can not breathe? You have dyspnea? I see you difficult in breathing.

42
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:12,610
-Yes and I have pain here but maybe it's the muscles because of all the attacks,

43
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:24,860
they are quite hard and before it was always dry. Now it's loose.

44
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:35,110
I took Lycopodium in January and maybe something changed, the cough.

45
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:40,610
My stomach is a little bit better because I have constipation since I was 2 years old.

46
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,610
-When you say stomach, you mean constipation?

47
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:53,960
-Yes bloatedness very much but much more before.

48
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:04,860
4 years ago I stopped taking milk products and it helps.

49
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:18,110
-Because the distention was worse, flatulence with milk. If you take milk do you have

50
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:27,710
more easy stool or still you are constipated?
-No, still I am. Not that bad.

51
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:35,620
Many years ago it was a week, 10 days.

52
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:48,370
-10 days no stool. Afterwards you will have normal stool without taking laxatives or you will take

53
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:55,360
laxatives and then you will have stool?
-I just take some herbs.

54
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:03,120
-Every day you take herbs?
-No, I wait, always wait to see.

55
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,520
-How is your energy in general?

56
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:17,770
-In general I think it's quite good but I have this for so long time, the stomach problem,

57
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:25,620
the colds, I got pain in joints but it has disappeared.

58
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,620
It disappeared after I eat very healthy.

59
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:45,770
I was 5-6 years old that I get urticaria here and here and when I was 8 I got high fever

60
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:57,770
and when I was in the first pregnancy I was 19, the cough started

61
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:04,790
and I was one time in the hospital to check and they called allergic asthma.

62
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:14,940
They wanted to treat me but I didn't want with the usual medicine.

63
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,250
-And you didn't want?
-No, never.

64
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:37,240
-You knew about Homeopathy already?
-No.

65
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,190
-But still you didn't want to treat you?

66
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:48,990
-Yes I knew this homeopath 15 years ago, I'm now 45, so I was 30.

67
00:08:49,090 --> 00:09:06,340
Yes it was after that I go to the hospital and I checked. But I don't use Homeopathy at that time.

68
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:10,740
-But still on the school medicine you said no, I don't want.

69
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,930
-Yes, I don't want.

70
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:27,720
-The cough was certain hour, when you wake up, when you lie down, before eating, after eating?

71
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:40,070
-Yes, in the evening is worse, night, when I lie down in bed.

72
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,720
-Then cough starts.
-Better to sit up.

73
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:56,220
-Then you have to take out some mucus before you can stop? How it stops?

74
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:03,460
-I think actually only this time I had mucus. I never had it before.

75
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,960
-Only here in Alonissos?

76
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:19,540
-Yes, it was always dry but I had always something in the sternum and if I start blow

77
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,290
I could go on for 5 minutes.

78
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,540
-When did you take Lycopodium?

79
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:30,260
-In January and I had to repeat it quite often because I was in a depressed situation

80
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:38,990
and I want to cry, I most work, so I didn't cry and I took Lycopodium because my stomach

81
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:41,000
was bad and it helped.

82
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,390
-It helped your psychology?
-Yes, very much.

83
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:54,040
-And Lycopodium did not help your cough?
-No. But it is loose.

84
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:10,790
-So Lycopodium actually is helping you. We cannot change the remedy because if you say

85
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:19,210
psychologically better and your cough has become loose, you have to wait with Lycopodium

86
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:27,460
and see what Lycopodium can do. You have taken Nat mur also?

87
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:33,230
-Yes one time.

88
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,060
-Ignatia?
-No.

89
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,560
-You take fruits?

90
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:52,060
-I'm quite thirsty so here it's warm, I like fruits but I want food.

91
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:59,310
-Solid food.
-I'm very often hungry, I have to eat very often.

92
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,740
-Otherwise you feel emptiness?

93
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:13,790
-Yes, I feel hungry and I can't think. But I have some suppression in a way because

94
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:23,460
when I was after the pregnancy I got very much perspiration under my arms.

95
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:32,880
It was very strong odor, it stained the linen I had to wash 3 times.

96
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:40,040
The doctor said it's nothing wrong with you and it went on for 5-6 years and I didn't want

97
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:45,230
to have it anymore, so I asked for an operation and took it.

98
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:54,630
-When it was that?
-I think I was 29.

99
00:12:54,730 --> 00:13:01,370
-At the age of 29 and at the age of 30 you started having dyspnea?

100
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,980
-It was worse yes.

101
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:19,730
-Did you use these anti-perspirants?

102
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:33,630
-Yes but I was so sensitive to them, I get eruption, soreness and redness.

103
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:40,730
-The perspiration was offensive?
-Yes it was very strong odor.

104
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:44,660
-You feel cold in general?
-No.

105
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,410
-Very hot?
-Not very hot but hot.

106
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,910
-Feet?
-No.

107
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:56,010
Before it was cold but I think some remedies did something with that.

108
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,870
-You take sweets?
-No.

109
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:02,150
-Salt?

110
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:18,720
-Spicy food but I like the olives and smoked salmon and soft boiled eggs.

111
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,720
But I was not thirsty before.

112
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:35,970
-Now you are thirsty here in Alonissos?
-Yes.

113
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,620
-Because it's very warm?
-Yes and the last years.

114
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,280
-It's very warm for you here? You feel very warm?

115
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:58,030
-Yes, here I drink 6-8 liters. I drink all the time but the last 2 days I have to have it

116
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,870
not so cold because it's irritating so much.

117
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:10,720
I try to drink a little less. Warm drinks help. I got tea yesterday and a little whisky.

118
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:20,470
-You like whisky?
-It disturbs so much, I had to do something.

119
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,470
-The whisky helps your thirst to be less?
-No, the cough.

120
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,220
-That's why you go out to cough?
-Yes.

121
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:59,720
-And so I was 12 years, I have a very bad warts under the soles and they use X-ray treatment, 24.

122
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:04,630
-You mean radiation.
-Yes.

123
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:19,390
-To kill them.
-It's a long time ago.

124
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:40,400
-They are painful.
-I have to use liquid.

125
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,210
-Cratches?
-Yes.

126
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:14,710
-You have any fear?
-Narrow places.

127
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,610
-Like going into a lift?

128
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:29,710
-Yes I can take a lift but if it's stairs and it's just 3-4 floors I take the stairs. If it's 10...

129
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:38,280
-Other fear? Dark?
-No. When I was a child yes very. Ghosts.

130
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:41,880
-You were afraid of ghosts.
-Not now.

131
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:48,360
-The water you drink you prefer it cold?
-Yes, I prefer it cold.

132
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:58,100
-But you don't drink it because it makes it worse. You had fear of thunderstorms?

133
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,950
-Not really.

134
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:09,350
-Did you ever take Calc carbo?
-I think maybe.

135
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:22,850
One person said take it because of the soft boiled eggs but maybe I did not take it, I waited.

136
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:32,950
But Medorrhinum did something. My legs get very heavy and stiffness when I go upstairs.

137
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,980
-After Medorrhinum?
-Yes.

138
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:47,880
-You said that you are a warm person?
-Yes, I need fresh air but fresh air goes here.

139
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,480
-Fresh air is not good for your chest.
-No.

140
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:59,280
-But you are rather warm.
-Yes but with the cold sometimes...

141
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:10,680
-You have problems with your stomach like indigestion?

142
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,320
-Yes.

143
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,020
-Pains in the stomach?
-More the distention.

144
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:41,620
-Not indigestion.
-Yes, heavy and fat food.

145
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:58,110
-You have any dizziness, vertigo?

146
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:05,110
-Not so much, sometimes I feel little weak with all the cough.

147
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:16,760
-The perspiration was mostly in arms or in your head also?

148
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,860
-Only arms.

149
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:58,220
I noticed for the last 2-3 years that after some cough I get palpitation.

150
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:17,990
-How many times you cough? You cough 1-2 times or you cough constantly?

151
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:25,240
-Sometimes just one, a hard one or 2,3,4 after.

152
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:47,990
But the high fever is gone. It's just cigarette smoke and some odors but the last one was the cat.

153
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,640
-You have sensitivity.
-Yes, the grass everything.

154
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:01,990
-Do you grind your teeth at night?
-I don't think so.

155
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:16,740
-And you never had again the eczema?
-No, I don't think so.

156
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,890
-And the perspiration gone totally?

157
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:33,640
-Yes, before the menstrual period is so little but if I exercise I have much perspiration,

158
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,470
I'm all wet.

159
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:37,220
-All the body?

160
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:48,320
-Yes and I noticed after this operation more perspiration when I exercise.

161
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:09,950
It's more easy to go to toilet when menstrual period comes.

162
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,040
-Do you have diarrhea during menstrual period?

163
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:38,780
-Yes, it could be the first day. Before I had lots of swelling in the breast but it's less.

164
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:44,370
-Psychologically you have?
-Lots of stuff?

165
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:50,160
-You become irritable, crying, depressed?

166
00:23:50,260 --> 00:24:02,720
-It's less, more before, little sadness last evening, going down before menses.

167
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:23,970
But my mother after the tuberculosis she had chronic bronchitis.

168
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:31,120
She coughed and coughed every night for years and in the morning...

169
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:35,370
-She is now?
-She died when I was 15.

170
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:39,220
-From what?
-Exhausted.

171
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:53,870
-She was just very weak. She had tuberculosis at the age of?

172
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:59,540
-I think she was 21,22.

173
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:41,130
-Did you take Sepia?
-Yes, he had in the paper.

174
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:44,480
I saw Sepia one time and there was no effect.

175
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,380
-Are you married now or divorced?

176
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:59,310
-I've been married twice and I've lived with a man for 6 years and we ended this January.

177
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:07,510
We tried to end it 2 years before but we got together again.

178
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:26,310
-And then on January you divorced. You did it?
-Yes, actually is both but I asked for it.

179
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:30,210
-Did you suffer because of that?
-Yes.

180
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,660
-Very much?

181
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:40,380
-More 2 years ago, I cried for half a year every day.

182
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:46,630
It's difficult if you are going to work because the lacrimation is swelling like this.

183
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:52,680
So this time I think I can not do that anymore so I have to do something.

184
00:26:54,900 --> 00:27:01,400
But the Lycopodium helped but I had to repeat it quite often.

185
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:07,550
-How often?
-After a week, 2 weeks.

186
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:09,380
-Lycopodium 200?

187
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:18,880
-200 2-3 times, 1M 2-3 times and when I took it the second time I shaked it and then

188
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:25,810
I took 10M 2 times I think. The last one I think it's 3 weeks ago.

189
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:37,710
-I can not see another possibility to advice you. You continue with Lycopodium

190
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:45,560
and see how it develops. You may, after Lycopodium, you may need again Pulsatilla.

191
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:55,560
-Another thing, my father had a heart attack when he was 50 and he has been a seaman.

192
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:03,810
-That's why you took the Medorrhinum.
-Yes.

193
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:17,740
-This cough because it's very long it's not easy to get out and you have to be patient.

194
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,300
Lycopodium seems to be working for you and we can not change it.

195
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,580
-OK.

196
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:29,380
-I don't know if it will stop working then see also Pulsatilla may come back

197
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:36,980
or some other remedy but I can not really tell you at this moment.

198
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:04,240
I don't have to say more about the case.

199
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:09,640
Anybody wants to ask something about this case?

200
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:17,030
The remedy seems to be acting because she says she feels better psychologically

201
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:23,230
and the distention is better, the cough is loose, that means you have to wait

202
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,980
and see how it's going to develop.

203
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:31,910
This kind of cough does not just go away like that. It will take time.

204
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:39,980
Maybe she will need another remedy before the cough really is better but now the remedy is correct,

205
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:47,080
she has to continue. As long as it's acting, she has to continue taking the remedy.

206
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:18,890
-I wish to ask you about this case, I think she is taking very often.

207
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:26,650
I think she doesn't wait maybe enough, maybe she is afraid and don't wait to see what happens

208
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:29,640
after some days or 1 week and so on.

209
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:41,910
Maybe it will be better the next time, I ask you, or now to begin with C12?

210
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:50,650
Because they are so many high potencies and maybe she will go in a proving.

211
00:30:51,900 --> 00:31:00,220
-As long as she follows the rules, that means when symptoms come back, she takes the remedy,

212
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:07,970
there is no problem even high potency. If she takes without reason,

213
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:10,470
of course  she may go into a proving.

214
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:22,720
If the high potency stops acting, she may drop into low potency and try the low potency

215
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:30,730
repeating 3 times the day 12 or even lower, you can go to 6 and start with 6,

216
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:36,820
3 times the day and take for 10-15 days.

217
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:45,220
If it is better yes you can continue but it seems that the remedy is acting.

218
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:50,720
And many times it's acting, maybe the first dose is acting, we take, we repeat,

219
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:58,470
we think the repetition is doing something where actually the first dose is doing something.

220
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:05,820
But if there is a relapse, then you are allowed to take another potency.

221
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:08,000
-No matter?

222
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:19,170
-No matter how long. Some organisms are more weak undermined and they need more

223
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:29,480
frequent repetition, as long as you have the symptoms back. This is clear.
