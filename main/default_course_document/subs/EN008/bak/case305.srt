1

10
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:57,430
Three homeopaths have seen the case. At least you've kept the remedies that you took.

11
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:58,310
-Yes.

12
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,710
-From the remedies you have taken shall I tell you what is your problem?

13
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,890
-If you want to.

14
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:38,940
-I can understand but it's a difficult case. No much physical pathology.

15
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,390
-Not at all.

16
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,320
-What is your biggest problem?

17
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:19,740
-Since I was a child is being extreme shyness. Terrible. As a child was terrible.

18
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,940
Going to school was very painful.

19
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,150
-Do you remember why you were shy?
-No, I remember this is the way I always was.

20
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,150
-But no why?
-Not really.

21
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:37,320
We had a difficult situation at home, in the family was lot of quarrelling,

22
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:51,340
my mother was very unhappy, she cried for days in a row, then she was completely exhausted.

23
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,680
-You come from Norway?
-Yes.

24
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,010
-And you have brothers, sisters?
-I have a younger brother.

25
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,980
-During these problems in the house you felt you had some responsibility?

26
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:18,400
-Yes, I was the preferred child. I was wanted and she came to speak to me about her problems.

27
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,490
-And you knew all the problems from the age of 8,9?

28
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:27,340
-I can't remember. Probably about that time she started confining in me, I'm not sure.

29
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,400
It was a very heavy load.

30
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,160
I love my mother above anything and to see her in that state

31
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:36,650
I just didn't know what to do, I didn't say anything.

32
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:43,330
-But you felt very sad?
-It was great pain to see her like that.

33
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:50,400
-And you did not cry because of that?
-I don't think so. I didn't.

34
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:55,920
-You listened to that silently without any...?
-Yes.

35
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:08,740
-So as a child you became already sad because of the situation.

36
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:23,160
-A kind of alone, it was a very lonely child, that's how I feel it was.

37
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,900
-You did not have contact with your brother?

38
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,150
-I looked at him as some problem. He was just on my way.

39
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:39,330
My father said I was jealous of him. Maybe of him.

40
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,240
-Your father did not like you very much, you think?

41
00:05:53,340 --> 00:06:02,320
-He didn't show any kind of affection, he was cool, he was mild person really.

42
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:16,990
But he was aloof, in his world. School was very painful.

43
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:34,830
-How the shyness came to the school?
-I don't know.

44
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:41,910
-You felt inferior?
-Yes very.

45
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:52,250
-Why? Because you were poor or because you were not having good luggage like the others?

46
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:57,980
-We were not rich. We were under lower but ...

47
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,170
-Not for that reason?

48
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:10,500
-There was nobody really rich where I lived. It wasn't a thing there.

49
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:22,320
-In the meantime you had feelings of sadness and grief?

50
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:35,710
-Yes. They came more as I grew, my mother got more desperate. She felt worse.

51
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:44,760
So I felt worse. I couldn't go to school and forget the situation at home.

52
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:53,820
She tried to leave us. She couldn't stand. Me and my brother was fighting and she said,

53
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:59,260
if you keep on I'm gonna move away and I was afraid when I came home she was gone.

54
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:05,090
I couldn't see a life after that. That was the end of the world.

55
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,910
I just couldn't imagine anything beyond that.

56
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,400
-Your mother is still alive?

57
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:16,000
-She is dead. She's died in 1987. My father died in 1974.

58
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:35,260
-Your mother what was her age when she died?
-She was 67.

59
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:44,600
-Your mother as you look back now she was suffering with some depression?

60
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:51,330
-Yes I would say so but she came out of this state after some days.

61
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:56,990
It took her a while to recuperate and then she was back to normal.

62
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:02,160
She was quite happy, she did the same things, she had no changes.

63
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:10,930
She was back to what it used to be just waiting for the next spell of this.

64
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:20,070
-As you describe now the situation I feel that emotions are coming

65
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:22,570
and you are ready to cry, is that correct?

66
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:32,740
-To a certain degree but not so much because I cried a lot over these things.

67
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:39,620
In connection with a separation from a girlfriend, it just came up very strongly.

68
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:46,240
Quite heavily for a few days actually, many years ago.

69
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:54,970
-Not the last months.
-15 years ago.

70
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:02,880
-You say that the main problem is shyness. You will not be able to stand up

71
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,730
and talk in front of public?

72
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:10,300
-I do sometimes and when I actually do it, it's OK.

73
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:18,820
When I first speak it's all right but preparing for it, before it's gonna happen I'm very ...

74
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,820
-You never received Silica?
-No.

75
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:40,100
-Next problem what would you say?

76
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:48,860
-Lack of concentration and memory. That's actually more of a problem in my every day life.

77
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:57,870
And having to be with people around.

78
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:10,930
If I stay alone for half a day I start feeling irritable and I feel uneasy,

79
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:18,840
especially if I don't have anything to look forward to. It's like it takes me down slowly.

80
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:25,030
-So you are better with company.
-Yes very much.

81
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:33,280
-What is the problems of memory, can you specify?

82
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:50,450
-If I have been out working and I've seen quite a few people, so I go to give a report.

83
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:58,100
What did you see? What happened? It's like I'm blank. What did I see today?

84
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:04,780
I just have to look at the names and then slowly comes back.

85
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:14,860
-Do you remember names?

86
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:20,040
-I have a hard time remembering names. Really hard.

87
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:37,200
And I might go from one room to another room and when I come why did I come here for?

88
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:44,860
And slowly OK, maybe I have to go back to the other room to get back the idea.

89
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:54,010
And if I work with papers is so hard to keep order in papers, it's such a mess.

90
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:01,160
-Especially keeping order with papers or keeping order in general?

91
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,670
-In general but especially with papers.

92
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:09,910
-Why is this? Because you feel it's too much work for you?

93
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:13,490
-Partly and then it's like papers are single things.

94
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:19,840
They are single pieces of paper and I don't see everything as a whole.

95
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:31,160
I just see pieces, so I just put them in wrong orders and try to fix my attention

96
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:40,090
to just one thing and then the next thing and then confusion.

97
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:47,260
-But your desk is organized or it is disorganized.

98
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,670
-Quite disorganized but I try hard to keep it organized.

99
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:03,990
-So you don't know where you put papers.
-No, I put piles...

100
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:10,330
-Piles of papers in one place and then you try to bring order.

101
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,640
-Yes.

102
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,170
-What else?

103
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:42,000
-Concentration like if somebody speaking I always drift off.

104
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:49,100
If he just says 2-3 sentences, I go off somewhere and can not fix my attention on something.

105
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:56,270
It's very hard, try to recall what happened.

106
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,920
-Do you fall asleep easily?
-Yes.

107
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:10,850
-During talk?
-Yes, not here but it can happen.

108
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:17,750
Like in meetings if I've said something when I'm through, I can easily half fall asleep.

109
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:29,490
It's like I'm so excited and then I'm done and am tired and fall asleep.

110
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:35,240
-You feel mentally tired you will say?

111
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:46,400
-Yes but it's very much up and down. Suddenly I'm very alert and then it's the opposite.

112
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,980
-Can you memorize if you want to study something?

113
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,760
-Very difficult.

114
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:58,560
If I read something, I might just look at it and I don't remember what I read.

115
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:03,980
Or I keep reading and my mind is going and I want to go back and reread it

116
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,500
because my mind is drifting.

117
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,090
-You have some notes there?
-Yes.

118
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:23,810
-Why you laugh? You remembered something. What did you remember?

119
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:32,750
-No, because sometimes I feel it's ridiculous. I feel my problems are ridiculous.

120
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:21,210
-You have any fears?
-Fear of the future and some very high places.

121
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:28,010
-Fear of the future?
-Yes like anxious about how I will be.

122
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,530
-About your health?
-Not about my health.

123
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:37,370
-Security, financial?
-Yes maybe financial, general security.

124
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:52,610
I get very cold in the night, towards the morning hours.

125
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:56,940
-While you are in bed?
-Yes, sleeping.

126
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,280
-Your feet mostly or the whole body?
-The whole body.

127
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:14,100
-When did you have that symptom, lately?

128
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:33,100
-I had it for many years, quite a few years. That time in the morning 2-3 o'clock

129
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:47,330
if I wake up, I always felt terribly bad at that time.

130
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,860
-I don't follow.

131
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:57,020
When you are in bed and you are asleep, you suddenly wake up and you feel terribly bad?

132
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:09,510
-Yes, if I have to go to the bathroom. I usually wake up once or twice. I get so worried.

133
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:17,540
I concentrate maybe on a small thing and I feel like it's the end of the world,

134
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,950
I just feel so bad.

135
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:30,450
Even if my dreams are fairly OK but very often my dreams are also at that time, very bad.

136
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:41,290
-You say you wake up from sleep in a state of anxiety or fear?

137
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:52,440
-Anxiety, depression, like the future is black.

138
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:18,940
-Not that you wake up in a fright.
-No.

139
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,440
-Are you homesick?
-No.

140
00:20:56,270 --> 00:21:01,010
-In general you would say you feel more the cold or more the heat?

141
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:05,330
You are more comfortable with the heat?
-With the heat.

142
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:11,600
-So it's a person who need a lot of covering.
-At night definitely.

143
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:16,420
-More than anybody else?
-Yes.

144
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:40,340
Even in summer I have thin [blanket] It's almost like it's worse when I'm at home.

145
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:46,110
When I'm out travelling, living with somebody else it's not so severe.

146
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:52,520
Neither the depression, nor the coldness.

147
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:25,450
-Do you have any notes concerning your desires, aversions for food?

148
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:33,300
-Yes. I like sweets, I like cakes, chocolate.

149
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,320
-Strong?
-Yes it's strong.

150
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:45,860
-Another?
-Fruits I like very much.

151
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:50,650
-What kind of fruits?
-Sweets fruits.

152
00:22:53,650 --> 00:23:00,490
-Another? Salt?
-Yes I take quite a lot of salt.

153
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:06,890
-Have you checked your blood pressure to see whether it's normal?

154
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:10,480
-Yes I have. I think it's fairly normal.

155
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:17,950
-The diastolic, the minima is towards the high side?

156
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:24,360
-I don't know actually. I had checked it a few years ago, they said it was normal.

157
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:28,880
-You are now...?
- 45.

158
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:51,450
-Like now I'm trembling with cold.

159
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:57,770
-But you are not dressed either, it's cool.

160
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:02,620
-Yes but when I'm in a pressed situation I easily tremble of cold, even if it's not very cold.

161
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:11,200
-Salt desire would you underline it?

162
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:38,940
-I'm not very fond of milk and I have aversion. I never liked milk very much.

163
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:50,220
-What about the sun? Can you stand lying under the sun or also the sun affects you?

164
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,870
-No, I like the sun.

165
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,120
-You don't have much in your country either.

166
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:13,880
Do you have anything else in your notes?
-Yes.

167
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:30,530
Those dreams are also like I'm not good enough. When I have these dreams at night

168
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:36,840
are also like I'm not good enough.

169
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,950
-In the dreams?
-Yes.

170
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:57,450
I feel inferior and unable to do whatever I suppose to be doing.

171
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:12,620
In the morning when I wake I feel quite OK, when I sleep enough I feel quite OK

172
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:19,960
but I don't want to talk to anybody. I just want to stay and wake slowly.

173
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,690
-In the morning you don't like company.

174
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:32,710
-No I don't. I want to slowly wake up and not talk to anybody, listen to the radio.

175
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:58,950
Then if I don' t go out working, if there is nothing to do, I get either very anxious

176
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:12,950
about that time 10-11, I need to do something or the other way around I get very sleepy

177
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:16,390
like if I start reading. That 's the worse thing I can do.

178
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:19,050
If I start reading, I get sleepy.

179
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:51,780
It's not that I might so much the company in the morning, it's that I don't want to talk,

180
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,980
I don't want to say something.

181
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:23,210
Sometimes I smile about serious things, I feel I'm expected I will be smiling over serious matters.

182
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,700
-Tell me something else.

183
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:03,310
-When I'm in a very bad state like when we are out eating in a restaurant

184
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:07,720
me and somebody else, I don't want the people of the other tables to hear what

185
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:14,130
I'm saying. Even though it's not important things, I just don't want them.

186
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:19,910
I think I don't want them to hear how weak I am, my weakness.

187
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:39,390
I was very late maturing.

188
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:45,730
-Why you say that?
-I suck my thumb, I was 12 years.

189
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:56,580
-Sexually when you became aware? At what age?
-Quite early I suppose.

190
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:00,660
-10?
-Probably yes.

191
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:16,400
-Have you been married in the meantime?
-Not married.

192
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:22,470
-You just live together, from time to time with different people or just one?

193
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:27,820
-No, I've been with 4.

194
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:05,330
-Do you ever talk about your sexual matters with friends?

195
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:07,410
-Not really.

196
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:27,820
-You never got Pulsatilla?
-No.

197
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,840
-How much water do you drink?

198
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:52,840
-Quite thirsty. I drink mostly when eating. Half a liter during meal.

199
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:59,480
-And you drink a lot during that time?
-Yes.

200
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:05,980
-You say like one liter?
-It could be yes, half a liter or more.

201
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:13,580
-The water has to be cold?
-Yes but not ice cold.

202
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:24,050
At night when I wake up I have to have just a sip of water because it's all dry inside.

203
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:28,830
I can feel the cold water coming down into my stomach it feels very good.

204
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:32,640
-Otherwise you feel dryness in general?

205
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:37,480
-In general the day time, no. At night only.

206
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:48,240
-Do you drink also, except of meal, do you drink tea or cold drinks during the day?

207
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:52,830
Do you need?
-Sometimes.

208
00:33:54,290 --> 00:34:00,600
-How is your digestion?
-Very good, I never had problems.

209
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,930
-No constipation?
-Never.

210
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:08,470
I would say rather on the contrary.

211
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:14,190
-And the stool is not formed?
-Normally formed.

212
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:29,260
Also when I wake up at night, my eyes are agglutinated. I have to pull them apart.

213
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,610
-Every morning?

214
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:37,790
-Not in the morning but in the middle of the night.

215
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:04,830
-Are you restless or you are rather calm?

216
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:10,840
-It depends on the situation. At home I would say I'm quite restless, when I'm alone.

217
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:16,600
When I have company, I don't feel that so strongly.

218
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:44,610
Also when I've been alone for a while and go back to see people, it's like my voice gets very thin.

219
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,460
-As if it's constricted.

220
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:17,890
-And the smiling is maybe involuntary.

221
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:25,890
-Involuntary or you are thinking something when you are by yourself and then you maybe smile?

222
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,620
-Maybe but it's more nervous when I'm with company

223
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,880
or when it's something expected from me.

224
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:41,710
When I go into a room with people and they all look at me then I might smile.

225
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:47,720
It's almost like I can not stop it. It's strong.

226
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:27,210
-Something else have you noticed?
-My tongue is usually white coated.

227
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:36,540
-Can I see it? Yellowish -white especially in the back. Do you have any salivation?

228
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:48,890
-Actually I did have before. I think it was clear but it felt sticky.

229
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:55,890
That was before different remedies.

230
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:03,380
-According to your report the remedy that has helped you most is Aurum.

231
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:08,470
-Yes, undoubtly I would say so.

232
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:17,300
-And it has worked to a certain level. What it took away? The deep depression?

233
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,560
Suicidal depression?

234
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:27,650
-I thought a lot of suicide as a relief but I knew I would never do it.

235
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,900
But I kept thinking, I wish it's over, I wish it's over.

236
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,630
-Would you say you are religious?
-Not particularly.

237
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:44,140
-Praying, did you have that?
-No.

238
00:39:54,890 --> 00:40:05,540
-Always when I get a cold I get swelling of tonsils. A lot of cavities I have.

239
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:13,210
My teeth are really bad, a lot of toothaches I've had since childhood with pain

240
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:18,260
sometimes extending up to temples.

241
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:23,370
-Always your pains extend to temples?

242
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:31,650
-Not always but sometimes it takes a long time, until I go to a dentist, so it starts shooting.

243
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:00,150
-Always your tongue is like that ?
-Yes.

244
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:02,800
-But your digestion has no problem?

245
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:17,400
-Some flatulence, like with company if I feel stressed...but that's not a big problem.

246
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:24,720
-You never took Sulphur?
- I took Sulphur.

247
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:27,800
That's the remedy that had negative effect.

248
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:39,710
I got some headaches afterwards that lasted for quite a while,

249
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:44,650
it was very uncomfortable with Sulphur.

250
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:50,920
-What about acutes? Do you get acutes?
-Sometimes.

251
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:54,800
-How frequently?
-Once a year.

252
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,960
-What type?

253
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:06,980
-Flu quite strong. It doesn't usually last very long.

254
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:13,240
-As a child did you take antibiotics?
-Not much I think.

255
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:27,320
I had some bad back pains when I was 10-12, at night. I couldn't sleep.

256
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:35,070
So I got heavy duty pain killers but then it disappeared. I don't know for how long I got it...

257
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:45,670
-And it was lower back or the whole back?
-Middle back in bed.

258
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:53,570
-While sleeping or even if you lie in bed the day time?

259
00:42:54,100 --> 00:43:00,050
-No, I remember it to be only during the night but I'm not sure.

260
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:03,470
-Otherwise do you remember other remedies, vaccinations?

261
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:12,810
-Vaccinations I've had. I'm naturally positive to tuberculosis.

262
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:20,070
My father had tuberculosis when I was very small.

263
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:26,480
-You were born already.

264
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:41,050
Are you afraid of high places looking down?

265
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:47,150
-Yes very high places. If it's very high, I feel very uneasy.

266
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:57,730
-And some vertigo also?
-I feel it to my guts, not really vertigo.

267
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:03,920
-Do you eat eggs?
-I like eggs.

268
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:07,570
-What type of eggs?
-Soft boiled.

269
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:15,150
-Why you laugh?
-Now I don't know.

270
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:22,560
-Because it's really something which is strong?
-No I like eggs, not very strong.

271
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:29,730
-You thought of Calc. carbonica?
-Yes I thought of Calc. carbonica right now.

272
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:38,140
-Did you think like this?
-I don't think it's my remedy.

273
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:54,390
-I see. How strong you would put this? You can eat every day?

274
00:44:54,490 --> 00:45:01,890
-I don't do it, I could. I eat several times the week.

275
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:16,570
-Two eggs every time?
-Yes. Mostly fried or soft boiled.

276
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:31,820
-Any perspiration during night in your back?
-In the summer I do and it's like cold perspiration.

277
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:42,650
-In your feet do you have any cold perspiration?
-Yes always my feet are cold and perspire a lot.

278
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:49,160
-Is offensive perspiration?
-Not particularly.

279
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:56,080
-The perspiration eats up the socks?
-No it doesn't.

280
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:36,420
In the summer I have big covers and I perspire and I perspire cold.

281
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:41,840
I can put my hand and I feel cold and clammy.

282
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:45,600
-In the summer?
-Yes.

283
00:46:49,090 --> 00:47:02,590
In the back, everywhere. Maybe not every night.

284
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:18,200
-What about onions, if you eat raw onions, do you have any problem?

285
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:19,740
-No problem.

286
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:23,880
-Tomatoes?
-No, it's OK.

287
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:31,030
I'm not very fan of tomatoes though these tomatoes here are good.

288
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:34,500
-Lemon you like?
-Not particularly.

289
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:45,460
-Between salt and sweet which one you put more?
-That's difficult.

290
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,540
-Almost the same? You would underline both two times?

291
00:48:54,800 --> 00:49:02,540
-I always put extra salt on the food. Sweets I like very much, especially chocolate.

292
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:09,220
But then I have times that I don't eat it like now, I don't eat much. But I like sweets.

293
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:40,970
-How is your sexual desire?
-It's very strong.

294
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:53,450
-If you have sexual intercourse, afterwards you feel good or you feel bad, tired?

295
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:55,550
-No, I think it's OK.

296
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:18,970
I had some pain in my right testes. Not serious pain about 22 years ago.

297
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:25,530
Then in a period of some months I had it.

298
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:29,720
-And it reappears now?
-Yes.

299
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:33,130
-Did you ever have any gonorrhea?
-No.

300
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:35,450
-Infections?

301
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:44,880
-Maybe yeast infection with my girlfriend at the time.

302
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:19,120
All my childhood it was very bad;

303
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:28,540
when I got 16 I just felt I had to get away from the family and I went away.

304
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:33,790
-You went to work?
-I went to the sea.

305
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:35,710
-Fishing?

306
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:45,460
-No merchant, was very good for me, I liked it even though I still had some problems.

307
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:50,720
It was still a step forward for me.

308
00:51:55,830 --> 00:52:01,560
-After that you changed professions?
-Yes, I've done different things.

309
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:44,230
I was always very attached to my mother, even if I was far away I felt very strong bonds with her.

310
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:49,390
-When she died did you cry?
-Yes I cried.

311
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:54,880
-For half an hour?
-For some days.

312
00:52:54,980 --> 00:53:05,040
I had some spells quite deeply. I was away then and then I came home

313
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,680
and very soon it became OK.

314
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:17,690
It was all right but I still for years dreamt of her that she was alive, we were together.

315
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:22,690
These dreams I had up to recently.

316
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:45,010
But I also think I never forgave her for threatening to leave.

317
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:51,950
That's part of the reason why I left, like I wanted to punish her for doing that to me.

318
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:05,370
-She made you feel very insecure all these years that you may be abandoned.

319
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:08,360
Do you have fear of being abandoned?

320
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:12,030
-I had very strong fears of being abandoned.

321
00:54:12,730 --> 00:54:24,790
I pick my first girlfriend looking at that thing very much, I knew that she wouldn't leave me.

322
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:31,510
That was one thing but there were other things too.

323
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:36,310
I went in the same pattern, I wanted to help her like I helped my mother.

324
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:43,270
It was her life that was important, so I was there for her. I did everything

325
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:45,780
and then it got just too much.

326
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:49,350
-She drew some energy, too much.

327
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:56,280
-Yes and then at a certain point I said, this is it, I can't give anymore. I got to get out.

328
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:06,550
That's when I cried terribly, deeply and gratefully. I felt good for months afterwards.

329
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:13,620
We separated, we got back together again but it was on different ground.

330
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:17,020
-More on give and take.

331
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:21,650
-Yes more but still it wasn't very good and finally we broke up.

332
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:27,250
But she is actually one of my best friends now, this is a long time ago.

333
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:48,520
Also I couldn't get another girl until she had got another man.

334
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:59,270
As long as I was number 1 I couldn't let go her and I knew she had to get another one

335
00:55:59,370 --> 00:56:03,630
so I had to feel that pain before I could be free.

336
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:10,510
It took a while but it happened, it was very painful, when she got another man.

337
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:16,290
I realized this is serious, she cares more for him than she does for me.

338
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:19,180
-That became painful.

339
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:27,770
-Yes and almost for a week I was awake night and day and then suddenly I could start crying;

340
00:56:27,870 --> 00:56:30,510
so I cried it out.

341
00:56:30,610 --> 00:56:32,020
-And then you felt OK?

342
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:41,450
-It was OK, I cried for some time within a few days and then it was OK.

343
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:58,710
-You like consolation?
-I'm not sure.

344
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:09,770
If there is a problem, if there is something where I'm really hurt I want to fix it myself,

345
00:57:09,870 --> 00:57:12,710
I want to take care with myself.

346
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:24,630
-You don't want interference?
-Yes, I want to show that I master it.

347
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:47,290
-OK.
-Thank you.

348
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:29,130
-He had some peculiar symptoms. You can read from here.

349
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:44,800
Is anybody that wants to insert in this repertorization another symptom?

350
00:58:50,640 --> 00:59:04,640
-I feel that I miss one rubric and this is my feeling that in his childhood, he was...

351
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:08,950
-Given a lot of responsibility?
-Yes and I couldn't find.

352
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:12,700
-I agree. We don't have that symptom.

353
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:16,710
-So when there is an ailment from that what do we do about it?

354
00:59:16,810 --> 00:59:19,380
-We don't have.

355
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:27,120
-I think Carcinosin has.
-No.

356
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:36,710
The rubric we don't have it in the Repertory. Ailments from too much responsibility.

357
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:45,310
As a child, he was given a lot of responsibility, we don't have that.

358
01:00:07,330 --> 01:00:13,150
Taking responsibility too seriously.

359
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:38,390
-Self-confidence, want of.

360
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,060
-Put want of self-confidence.

361
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:46,730
How many times you want to underline it?
-3 times.

362
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:59,240
-Here in Murphy mind responsibility, burden with too young of age, Calcarea and Carcinosin.

363
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:04,480
Could that fit?

364
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:25,640
-There are a couple of rubrics I would like to add; one is untidy, accepting what is performing.

365
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:30,490
He mentioned that he is very untidy throughout.

366
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:34,410
-Do we have such a symptom? Where?

367
01:01:35,490 --> 01:01:39,070
-It says untidy except in what he is performing.

368
01:01:48,670 --> 01:01:51,810
-This rubric is there? What are the remedies?

369
01:01:51,910 --> 01:01:55,000
-There is just one remedy, Carcinosin.

370
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:57,820
-Very good, put that.

371
01:01:59,610 --> 01:02:11,240
-There is also another rubric which is ailments from prolonged and unresolved grief

372
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:19,560
and it seems the thread of this case when even though he left for the sea,

373
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:24,570
maybe it's also an indication of what he left for, but when his mother died,

374
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:29,940
he continued to have dreams for years after her and the dreams were that she was still with him

375
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:32,570
and still having relationship with her.

376
01:02:37,810 --> 01:02:44,060
-If you want pathology wise to characterize this case, what you would say?

377
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:56,160
It is a case of depression? Grief?

378
01:02:58,870 --> 01:03:06,950
-Grief, a lot of grief. Give him Natrum muriaticum, finish.

379
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:21,530
-During the case taking he once said that he hates his mother and that by leaving home

380
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:27,770
he wanted to punish her for her threat that she had given to him in advance.

381
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:32,180
That's something I think we might have to add in the rubrics.

382
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:38,630
-He hated his mother. It is an expression, wait a moment.

383
01:03:39,330 --> 01:03:42,100
We have to go to the real meaning.

384
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:54,690
He was very sad because his mother threatened him to abandon them and he was not hating,

385
01:03:54,790 --> 01:04:01,980
he loved his mother. He was attached to his mother but every time mother is leaving...

386
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:05,700
mother is leaving. This is not hating.

387
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:14,150
And finally he said, OK let me leave, see how you feel. This is not hatred.

388
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:21,790
It's something different. I didn't perceive it as hatred of the mother.

389
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:28,100
-The way I remember that the patient said, he didn't say I hated my mother

390
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:31,470
but he said I couldn't forgive my mother for doing this.

391
01:04:37,470 --> 01:04:49,120
-I think that if he hated his mother, he would not have suffer so much after her death.

392
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:57,020
It's very obvious that he loved, he was attached to his mother very much.

393
01:04:57,120 --> 01:05:00,860
That's why he suffered a lot. These are the facts.

394
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:06,950
Now the fact that he was suffering all these years by the threat of his mother,

395
01:05:07,050 --> 01:05:11,690
threatening him that she will leave, it is a fact.

396
01:05:11,790 --> 01:05:18,970
He was suffering because of that but I didn't perceive that he was hating his mother.

397
01:05:28,970 --> 01:05:39,300
The case, as it was developing, let's see the different remedies that came to the mind.

398
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:48,470
He has received a lot of remedies already.

399
01:06:00,210 --> 01:06:07,950
The remedy that I was thinking in the beginning was Silica

400
01:06:09,870 --> 01:06:20,110
because of this tremendous shyness and Pulsatilla also. These were two of the remedies

401
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:22,380
that they were coming up.

402
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:30,950
Eventually there was another remedy that appeared because of lack of concentration

403
01:06:31,050 --> 01:06:42,960
and the difficulty and the memory and especially because he had a keynote symptom.

404
01:06:43,970 --> 01:06:54,470
In the morning when he wakes up, he doesn't want to talk and that is a symptom of Alumina.

405
01:06:56,050 --> 01:07:05,770
Alumina is having a similar type of mind as is the one that he said.

406
01:07:05,870 --> 01:07:12,610
I can not concentrate, I can not remember, I read and I don't understand what I read,

407
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:14,380
I forget etc.

408
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:29,130
Eventually the idea of Baryta carbonica also was there

409
01:07:36,630 --> 01:07:42,630
and finally the idea of Calcarea carbonica.

410
01:07:49,450 --> 01:07:54,920
As far as I remember these were the remedies that were going through.

411
01:07:55,020 --> 01:08:02,300
The possibility of Lycopodium, smiling etc. you may have been thinking of Lycopodium.

412
01:08:04,030 --> 01:08:23,500
And also in the repertorization Calcarea carbonica is very strong and then Sepia of course.

413
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:31,440
Sepia was another remedy but Baryta carbonica and Sepia, if I remember well were given already.

414
01:08:34,190 --> 01:08:40,110
The possibility of Sulphur also, I was investigating as well.

415
01:08:41,110 --> 01:08:47,900
Especially with agglutinated eyes, ice and things like that.

416
01:08:50,110 --> 01:08:52,260
-He had Sulphur.

417
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:59,110
-He had Sulphur with bad effect. Lycopodium had without any effect,

418
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:02,020
Sepia I don't remember he had Sepia?

419
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:05,530
-A little bit of an effect.

420
01:09:07,020 --> 01:09:12,850
-And the most of the effect was from Aurum, where he felt better.

421
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:22,860
That means that that was a case of depression. Now is the next layer.

422
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:32,510
Say, he would have come originally to us, most probably we would have given Aurum

423
01:09:32,610 --> 01:09:38,920
because the type of depression that he would present during that time,

424
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:44,630
would be much stronger than the depression he is showing now.

425
01:09:44,850 --> 01:09:48,610
Now he is not showing that he is in a deep depression.

426
01:09:51,120 --> 01:10:01,600
That there is some grief the brain is tired, he can not follow, he can not study,

427
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:07,440
he can not remember etc. but you can not say that this is a deep depression.

428
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:15,040
Actually what we're trying now to find out is the underline remedy after Aurum.

429
01:10:16,530 --> 01:10:22,840
It's very interesting and we have said it many times that a similar remedy,

430
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:30,600
a remedy which is close may have some effect and therefore people will say,

431
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:36,690
I felt a bit better in this and a bit better in that.

432
01:10:36,790 --> 01:10:42,720
But actually going right to the center and prescribing for the layer,

433
01:10:42,820 --> 01:10:52,150
the real layers Aurum was prescribing upon the layer.

434
01:10:53,420 --> 01:11:02,650
Aurum was put on his back by the behavior of his mother.

435
01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:13,800
You see, the same behavior in another constitution, it would have made the child Veratrum album.

436
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:21,080
And another, it would have made the child Lycopodium, Ignatia, Nat. muriaticum.

437
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:28,750
You see how each organism gives its own peculiarities.

438
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:38,970
So there seems to be some confusion in the case because of having received so many remedies

439
01:11:39,070 --> 01:11:48,220
and some of them having an effect but still I maintain that the remedy is quite clear

440
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:58,500
and therefore you have to study the case tonight and tell me what is the remedy.

441
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:21,910
I would like to see who prescribed Lycopodium? Who prescribed Baryta carbonica?

442
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:37,650
One. Who prescribed Calcarea carbonica? Who prescribed Alumina?

443
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:46,160
Who prescribed Pulsatilla? Who prescribed Silica?

444
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:54,490
So Calcarea carbonica and then Silica is the choice of the class.

445
01:12:59,510 --> 01:13:01,150
What about me?

446
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:17,320
He does not look like Calcarea carbonica, he looks like Silica more.

447
01:13:18,860 --> 01:13:26,800
He is quite cold, he is perspiring a lot. Both Calcarea carbonica and Silica they feel cold,

448
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:28,760
they perspire a lot.

449
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:38,750
What is the difference between the Calcarea perspiration and the Silica perspiration?

450
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,580
-Silica is more offensive.

451
01:13:47,330 --> 01:13:53,250
-And Calcarea is more clammy.

452
01:13:55,500 --> 01:14:07,500
The Silica has definitely more offensiveness, the perspiration is quite acid

453
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:12,830
and it eats up the socks.

454
01:14:13,570 --> 01:14:17,180
When there is a lot of perspiration with Silica.

455
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:23,350
So here the perspiration it goes in favor with Calcarea carbonica.

456
01:14:24,830 --> 01:14:33,570
He is very shy. What is the difference between the shyness of Silica

457
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:36,670
and the shyness of Calc. carbonica?

458
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:54,890
Silica, as you remember, is shy mostly in front of the public, when she has to perform

459
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:57,030
when she has to give a speech.

460
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:12,410
I can not be Silica. Forget it. Silica will be much more organized.

461
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:22,250
I walk, I do my hands, not very much shyness. I have but not very much.

462
01:15:29,830 --> 01:15:36,480
In the Repertory also, if you open the Repertories, it shows very strongly

463
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:51,220
and there is also a kind of, how can I say? The shyness which contains some intelligencia.

464
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:57,570
Intellectuals with shyness.

465
01:16:01,170 --> 01:16:14,840
Self-conscious, lack of self-confidence and what shall I say?

466
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:24,160
Calcarea carbonica is not known as a remedy for shyness.

467
01:16:25,170 --> 01:16:27,900
You will not of Calcarea carbonica when you have shyness.

468
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,390
You have other remedies to think when the main problem is shyness.

469
01:16:32,490 --> 01:16:35,740
He says my main problem is shyness.

470
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:52,140
So it's less intense and in the end perhaps he brought out an information

471
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:55,570
that was more specific.

472
01:16:56,330 --> 01:17:06,730
I'm not sure, I want to confirm now, whether he was saying that I feel the others

473
01:17:06,830 --> 01:17:10,820
and what they are thinking and to that I am quite shy.

474
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:14,340
Can you specify more?

475
01:17:29,830 --> 01:17:33,810
-If I'm in a bad state I don't want them to see how I feel,

476
01:17:33,910 --> 01:17:40,390
I don't want them to see the weakness of my eyes, I don't want to show my vulnerability.

477
01:17:40,490 --> 01:17:50,070
-Yes but is this what you call shyness or what you call shyness is something else?

478
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:55,740
-This is the shyness I would say.

479
01:17:57,490 --> 01:18:04,330
-So this kind of shyness fits again not with the Silica shyness

480
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:09,350
but with the Calcarea carbonica shyness.

481
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:23,350
We had a symptom for Alumina, he said my mind does not function.

482
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:35,270
Now maybe you have not seen a case of Alumina but does Alumina speaks in this way?

483
01:18:35,850 --> 01:18:37,330
-No.

484
01:18:37,430 --> 01:18:38,250
-No.

485
01:18:38,350 --> 01:18:46,440
As I have performed Alumina or you have seen a case, Alumina speaks much more slow

486
01:18:47,190 --> 01:18:53,930
and the constipation is coming out of words.

487
01:18:58,350 --> 01:19:19,440
It's not stammering, it is an effort to think that is it so, I don't know, maybe.

488
01:19:20,390 --> 01:19:26,270
This type is the Alumina mentality.

489
01:19:28,510 --> 01:19:36,350
He is not. He gave straight answers. Then I asked are you constipated?

490
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:46,420
Let's forget that his mentality is typical, let's see if his digestion is typical.

491
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:56,030
He says no, my stool is lose and normal. Out of the window Alumina.

492
01:20:00,770 --> 01:20:09,360
In this way you differentiate quickly and then you say Alumina is worse heat.

493
01:20:11,180 --> 01:20:14,680
Another question. Are you worse heat or cold?

494
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:24,420
No, I'm worse cold but I'm perspiring. And what is the perspiration?

495
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:25,920
-Clammy.

496
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:29,190
-What is further? Cold.

497
01:20:30,020 --> 01:20:44,520
I take this and my feet are cold and clammy, the case is finished.

498
01:20:45,530 --> 01:20:55,620
Then you ask about eggs. I would have like to show you again this reaction.

499
01:20:55,720 --> 01:21:05,010
Eggs everybody likes but when there is an excess in the liking, there is this spark

500
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:13,600
that comes with the feeling. There is the feeling, well I like eggs. Soft.

501
01:21:15,110 --> 01:21:26,420
On top of all that it was coming the soft eggs and on top of all that came what else?

502
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:34,270
What else is characteristic of Calcarea carbonica?

503
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:44,950
I do it by memory, you have studied the case, I have to do all the work.

504
01:21:45,940 --> 01:21:49,110
-Fear of his condition being observed?

505
01:21:49,210 --> 01:21:56,690
-We said that but one more symptom which confirms again Calcarea carbonica

506
01:21:56,790 --> 01:21:59,870
which he spoke about?

507
01:22:01,620 --> 01:22:09,710
-Sweet and salty and fear in the high places.

508
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:19,960
-This is typical for Calcarea carbonica. Fear or vertigo high places is typical.

509
01:22:21,210 --> 01:22:28,680
It is typical for a few remedies, not only Calcarea carbonica but let us say

510
01:22:28,780 --> 01:22:38,790
how many Calcareas have fear of high places? I can say between 70-80%.

511
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:45,780
It's very high 80%, if a symptom is always there, is very strong

512
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:52,210
and when a person gives you that symptom, which confirms all the others,

513
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:57,050
that makes definitely a case of Calc. carbonica.

514
01:22:58,710 --> 01:23:07,620
What is not typical of Calc. carbonica for his perspiration?

515
01:23:09,290 --> 01:23:12,000
-That it's not at the back of his head, in the neck.

516
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:21,830
-That is not here. You like to see the perspiration on the cervical region mostly.

517
01:23:21,930 --> 01:23:30,710
So when you say where do you perspire, he puts his hands there.

518
01:23:33,210 --> 01:23:34,700
He makes this movement.

519
01:23:35,290 --> 01:23:42,720
He made this movement. This is not typical but still is this.

520
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:48,780
You see how subtle you have to be and at the same time put things together

521
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:52,620
from different angles? Don't leave it only to perspiration.

522
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:56,050
Clammy perspiration, Calc. carb.

523
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:03,270
Not like that. You have to have all the other symptoms.

524
01:24:03,370 --> 01:24:06,710
And then you have the slowness of the mind.

525
01:24:06,810 --> 01:24:13,620
There is definitely a slowness of the mind which he says, Calc. carb. is OK.

526
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:17,690
The shyness is OK.

527
01:24:17,790 --> 01:24:26,060
That is why in the Repertorisation, which I showed you, it came very prominent.

528
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:37,330
So Calc. carb. in this case, what potency? Who says 200?

529
01:24:40,890 --> 01:24:46,710
Who says 1M? Who says 10M?

530
01:24:48,970 --> 01:24:53,120
You are learning. Who says 50M?

531
01:24:53,880 --> 01:25:00,550
You can do 50M. In this case you can easily do 50M, no problem.

532
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:12,460
This is how you learn. Why? Because you know the why also, why you say 10M?

533
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:15,800
You don't just say 10M. You know why?

534
01:25:17,890 --> 01:25:25,990
Because his pathology is mostly on the mental-emotional, there is no physical pathology,

535
01:25:26,090 --> 01:25:33,290
as far as we can understand and therefore 10M or 50M is a potency

536
01:25:33,390 --> 01:25:37,890
that can be given easily in his case.

537
01:25:39,890 --> 01:25:47,640
So you have to take one dose of 10M and one 50M. So all the class is satisfied.

538
01:25:51,470 --> 01:26:00,120
And see when you come next time, you better give a positive follow up.

539
01:26:00,220 --> 01:26:05,380
Otherwise the students will require this to be played back.

540
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:14,780
-A question please. I found typical, instead of Silica, he had fear for the future,

541
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:19,790
for Calcarea, a lot of phobias and instead of Silica...

542
01:26:19,890 --> 01:26:28,630
-Very good. That's another point for Calc. carbon., fear of the future and fear of poverty.

543
01:26:29,390 --> 01:26:35,790
Calcarea is one of the main remedies, with Psorinum, with Sulphur, with Calcarea-flourica etc.

544
01:26:35,890 --> 01:26:44,050
The Calc. carb. is also there and he expressed his fears in future and in financial matters.

545
01:26:46,140 --> 01:26:53,700
We have a typical case of Calc. carb. in which he has been given for 3-5 years

546
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:59,790
all the other remedies except of Calc. carb. Why is that?

547
01:26:59,890 --> 01:27:04,310
That I am very concerned and very disappointed?

548
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:07,810
What happens? They are not my students?
