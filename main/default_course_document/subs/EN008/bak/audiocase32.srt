1
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:32,020
-In looking over the cases that we got in the course I got this idea in my mind...

2
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:39,170
I want to ask you if this is right. (?)

3
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:51,500
It seems to me (?) then you look for some keynotes.

4
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,760
-I cannot say that I have a fixed way of looking in a case.

5
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:25,430
I have seen thousands of cases and I can say that everytime I see a case it's a new case.

6
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:32,080
I might decide of a remedy by just looking at the person, I never did.

7
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:42,590
That's an extreme and then in another case I may go on for two hours with keynotes, essences.

8
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:53,420
I cannot put it down to a process inside which is stabilized.

9
00:01:54,010 --> 00:02:02,340
I try to give you on what I base my prescription, in that analysis I did.

10
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:13,080
You will see with every case and you will see with that case also what is in practice,

11
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,670
what happens really when you take a case.

12
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:37,760
This is a man of 65 years old, 63 years old, sorry.

13
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:46,520
He is 86 kilos and his height is 1,67m.

14
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:58,610
Since four years he complains about severe arthritic condition,

15
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:02,270
which affects mostly the joints,

16
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:11,960
together with an allergic kind of swelling of the hands.

17
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:29,870
The palms become very red, swelled up, they produce little pimples, they itch tremendously.

18
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:52,030
The other thing he complains is bloatedness of the stomach, which is underlined 3 times

19
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:02,350
and gas, which is not offensive.

20
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:12,030
Worse with beens and peas and with tea, underlined both 3 times.

21
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:36,190
The arm, the hands and the allergic condition,

22
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:42,110
which is mostly on the hands but go to all the extremities, it goes on the legs as well,

23
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:47,620
is much better by warm bath, underlined twice.

24
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:55,670
By warm bath also the the pain is ameliorated.

25
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:10,620
Mostly the joints which are affected are the wrist, the knees, the shoulder joints

26
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,650
and the ankles.

27
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:34,980
He complains for sleeplessness, he wakes up at 2.30 and he cannot sleep anymore.

28
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,480
Restlessness during sleep, underlined twice.

29
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:05,740
And jerking of legs during sleep, underlined twice.

30
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:15,320
The last year there are flashes of heat.

31
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:37,080
He is worse in warm weather, underlined 3 times.

32
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,070
Better open air, underlined 3 times.

33
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:52,130
Better in the sea, underlined 3 times but not the allergy.

34
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:56,000
The allergy is not affected in the sea.

35
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:11,140
He is very allergic to the pine trees and he has bought a place near the sea with pine trees

36
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,600
inside, it was a very beautiful place, where he was not able to enjoy.

37
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:21,380
For the last 4 years I heard that I cannot go, I cannot approach the place.

38
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:31,150
As soon as I'm there the itching starts, it's real hell, I just don't go anymore.

39
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:50,000
He is generally worse onions, underlined 3 times and garlic, underlined once.

40
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:01,050
And he has an irritability on wind.

41
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:12,240
Desires. There is one very strong desire for sweets, 3 times.

42
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:35,510
This is the case. We have to find the remedy.

43
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:46,740
Just look a little bit in your Repertory and tell me if you get any idea.

44
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:58,400
Out of the 5 people, whoever said Lycopodium?

45
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:10,460
There is bloatedness of the stomach and gas, which is not offensive, which is Lycopodium.

46
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:16,710
Worse beans and peas and things like that are very much Lycopodium.

47
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:24,900
Bloatedness from tea, very strong, But we don't have it in the Repertory.

48
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,140
We don't have that information.

49
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:40,370
He has bloatedness from the tea, we could have used that information, in case we had it

50
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:48,800
and in case we are desperate, we go to generalities and we make a general idea on there.

51
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,570
In generalities we got this idea.

52
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:04,300
I shall give you now some more information about the person.

53
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:25,710
He said that at the age of 23, he had a collic of the kidney,

54
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:29,790
he cannot remember which one of the two, he had colic of the kidney

55
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:36,290
and staphylococciassis at the age of 26.

56
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:42,230
Staphyylococcus infection, very severe, he was hospitalized.

57
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:55,140
At the age of 17 he had gonorrhea.

58
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:21,210
If you have the better in the sea, which is very strong, underlined 3 times

59
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:28,080
but his allergy is not ameliorated in the sea.

60
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:43,590
What I wanted to say is that you would prescribe Medorrhinum, if the information stops here.

61
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:49,160
Most of you, you would have prescribed Medorrhinum.

62
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:59,510
He had been operated for hernia and he had an eczema on the penis.

63
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:16,800
He had a slight swelling of the heart, he is a very solid man, solidly built, intelligent,

64
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:22,720
realistic and all that...

65
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:49,490
The position, which he sleeps now. Where, in which position he sleeps?

66
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:54,830
If he was Lycopodium, he would sleep on his right side.

67
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:59,600
It is characteristic of the Lycopodium, he wants to lie on the right side

68
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,490
because on the left side he is aggravated.

69
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:08,500
He does not like to lie on the left side, he is aggravated lying on the left side.

70
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:15,170
Lycopodium likes to lie on the right side.

71
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:23,010
The Medorrhinum likes to lie on his abdomen. He is ameliorated by lying on the abdomen

72
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,860
and he likes lying on the abdomen.

73
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:34,820
Now, which position this man sleeps? He sleeps on abdomen, underlined twice.

74
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:47,400
Now you make your decision.

75
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:58,460
I was thinking the same line as you are thinking about Medorrhinum.

76
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,040
I said, my god, I have a case of Medorrhinum.

77
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:07,640
This gonorrhea, better in the sea, sleeps on the abdomen, desire for sweets

78
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:14,410
and a man who is sexually quite good.

79
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:31,580
Something is missing, not enough information to really bring it down to Medorrhinum.

80
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:46,520
Therefore I continued the investigation in this case to find out a few more things about him.

81
00:14:50,060 --> 00:15:04,050
He is warm from the waist downwards, he said I'm quite warm and I stick my feet out of covers.

82
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:11,970
Sticking feet out of covers, if you look on the Repertory, heat in the extremities,

83
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:22,000
feet uncovers them, see which are the remedies there?

84
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:35,240
Uncovers them and then there is another one which says soles, burning on the soles.

85
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:43,450
When it's only down on the soles, it has another rubric further down,

86
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:47,210
which is Lycopodium and Sulphur and then it says uncovers the soles.

87
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:50,650
Not this one, uncovering the feet.

88
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:11,290
In this case you have two keynotes symptoms of Medorrhinum and uncovering the feet...

89
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:19,550
There is another keynote of Medorrhinum. You have 3 keynotes of Medorrhinum now.

90
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:25,380
But the third keynote is a keynote also for Pulsatilla, for Sulphur

91
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,730
and for several other remedies.

92
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:39,410
I told you that he is thirsty, did you write that?

93
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:43,070
The person is thirsty, underlined 3 times.

94
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:55,480
The irritability from wind... Did you find it?

95
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:17,330
You go to the 1422. We see no Medorrhinum.

96
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:29,050
Be careful now. With the information I'll give you further you will see,

97
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:32,470
everybody will say this is the remedy.

98
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:41,050
I was thinking of Medorrhinum all the time and Lycopodium.

99
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:50,320
And then he is very thirsty and then there is a strong desire for alcohol, beer and wine.

100
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:56,570
Then I asked what about fears? He does not have any fear.

101
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:06,080
He says I'm a man of... He works for the intelligent service and it's a fact.

102
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:20,130
No fears really but he says I have one fear only and that's fear of high places.

103
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:24,810
It's impossible that I look down from a high place and vertigo also.

104
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:42,920
Look vertigo high places, look in your Repertory, those who do not know.

105
00:18:54,660 --> 00:19:01,000
A warm person which sticks his feet out, he is afraid of the high places

106
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:06,600
and at 11 o'clock he has an empty feeling...

107
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:19,230
This is a fact, this is how a case develops.

108
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:24,680
You try more and more to get the totality, I could not get the essence.

109
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:30,250
The person had more fears, he was very matter of fact man,

110
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:35,880
he didn't seem to have aberrations concerning his psyche or his mental abilities,

111
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:42,420
he is very acute, his psychological condition was quite good.

112
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:51,500
And then I said to myself, Ok there is a fear in this case, a keynote

113
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:57,250
which is against Sulphur. Which is it?
-He is warm.

114
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:05,640
-Very warm, itching but better warm and something that puts out of your mind Suphur

115
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:13,450
because Sulphur usually gets worse when it gets warm and the itching gets

116
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:18,150
tremendously aggravated, especially with water.

117
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:22,900
We had here a keynote, which is against Sulphur,

118
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,380
which is the opposite of what Sulphur has.

119
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:35,450
And yet we had strong argument eventually and we have the totality of the symptoms here

120
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:43,240
to base a prescription on the totality of the symptoms, which is Sulphur.

121
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:48,100
One or two of his symptoms are not covered by the totality.

122
00:20:48,200 --> 00:21:00,590
Worse onions and aggravated by onions is Lycopodium, Nux vomica, Pulsatilla and Thuja.

123
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:07,720
It's not Sulphur, so the aggravation from onions could have taken away from us

124
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:13,560
and the thinking could have been this man perhaps is Medorrhinum or Thuja case.

125
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:17,630
Because the worse onions could go to another layer,

126
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:25,740
where Thuja would appear after Medorrhinum and that was a line of thinking I was doing.

127
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:32,830
But when you put together everything, all the information finally,

128
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:38,830
you come to a totality of a symptom where you say this totality is Suphur.

129
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:47,350
You don't have essesnce but you have the totality with some keynotes to back it.

130
00:21:52,350 --> 00:22:01,260
-If it was a Medorrhinum case would you see the emotional symptoms of Medorrhinum?

131
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:07,410
-You cannot say that. If you have Medorrhinum symptoms yes.

132
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,750
Aversion to vinegar and garlic, did I give you that?

133
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:21,750
-No.

134
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:26,850
-There is also strong aversion to vinegar and garlic.

135
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:39,760
Aversion to vinegar, there is no rubric. You will find aversion to acids.

136
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:47,190
Sulphur is there too.

137
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:57,160
Medorrhinum likes acids or has an aversion to acids?

138
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,840
-Likes.

139
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:06,910
-Likes acids and why? How do we know that he likes acids?

140
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,950
-Sour fruits.
-Sour fruits.

141
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:20,580
Medorrhinum has a desire on unripe foods, the green foods desires them very much.

142
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:29,420
Unless you have a knowledge of Materia Medica, you cannot very much appreciate

143
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:35,250
what I'm talking about but I hope you understand and we communicate.

144
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:40,510
This is a case finally where you have to prescribe Sulphur,

145
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:42,830
you cannot prescribe another remedy,

146
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:50,190
yet the whole totality of that person is not covered by Sulphur.

147
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:56,850
So we have a partial totality of the prescription here.

148
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:13,750
I expected that some time or another he would get Medorrhinum.

149
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:22,040
In his process of development, it's going to be a stage where he would need Medorrhinum.

150
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:40,740
There was also another information, better open air I did not give it to you?

151
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,690
-Yes.

152
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:45,280
-Did I give it to you? Underlined 3 times?
-Yes.

153
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:58,510
-Is Sulphur worse with the wind?

154
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:03,190
-Not characteristic of Sulphur, it's characteristic of other remedies like Lycopodium,

155
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:09,580
Podophyllum, Camomilla, Nux vomica, much more than Sulphur.

156
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:15,310
You go to wind aggrevates in the generalities

157
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:19,490
and you will see there Sulphur is perhaps ordinary.

158
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:39,830
I prescribed Sulphur 200 for him one dose.

159
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:52,880
When I say he had a severe arthritis, it was really severe, he was limping from pain

160
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,480
or he would stay in bed.

161
00:25:55,580 --> 00:26:01,560
The arthrosis were swelled up and red and very painful

162
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:06,830
and also the allergic condition quite strong.

163
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:16,800
He says that the first 3, 4 first days he had very severe pain on the left side

164
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,890
and then on the right.

165
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:40,750
The itching went down to the legs and then came up to the head again.

166
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:57,410
He had the itching in different parts of the body, it went down and then it came up severe.

167
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:08,480
And great weakness, weariness the first 10 days

168
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:17,890
but the sleep became better immediately and the stool became better.

169
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:22,970
He was having most probably a constipation, which he did not mention on the first time.

170
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:27,290
Now the constipation went away and the sleep became normal.

171
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:29,300
You remember he had a great problem.

172
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:34,800
2- 2.30 he would wake up and could not sleep anymore and he would get up and read

173
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:41,890
and walk and do anything until the morning where he would leave the house.

174
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:46,240
Now his sleep became better.

175
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:14,830
He said he had such a bloatedness the 12th day that reminded him a situation around 1959

176
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:37,480
that it was found in his intestines lamblias, it's a parasite.

177
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,590
There was a period in his life where he did not mention

178
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:55,190
when I was taking his past history but now that the bloatedness became so severe,

179
00:28:55,290 --> 00:29:02,610
he said it reminded me of the state of 1959...

180
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:30,040
This case was taken around 1979, 59 was 20 years before that he had the same situation.

181
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:36,780
Desire for sweet, less.

182
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:50,770
He has a hunger during night and if he wakes up he eats something,

183
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:53,530
which is a characteristic of Sulphur.

184
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:05,210
In the beginning also he said I had more irritability than usual.

185
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:23,800
He went to his country house and there was no problem.

186
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:34,040
Perspiration is less, desire for alcohol and stimulant is less.

187
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,370
Lately he had developed a desire to eat eggs.

188
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:49,950
Now he sleeps at 8.30 in the morning. He sleeps even afternoon.

189
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:55,770
In Greece we take naps in the afternoon and he was never able to sleep in the afternoon.

190
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:58,260
Now he takes a nap.

191
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:04,950
During the last days he says, he wakes up frequently.

192
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,680
He sleeps and wakes up frequently, he sleeps again

193
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:13,710
which is a characteristic of Sulphur as well.

194
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:31,620
Anyhow he remains well for at least a year.

195
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:40,270
The third time he comes is after a year where a dentist has given him injections

196
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:58,290
and put some oil of cloves inside and he starts having a relapse.

197
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:18,930
He starts having a relapse with one difference now. There is a desire for oranges.

198
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:26,590
You know the desire for oranges is Medorrhinum characteristic.

199
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:41,240
Now what you will do?
-All the other (?)

200
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:51,840
-Not to this severity but there was a relapse definitely.

201
00:32:52,800 --> 00:33:00,420
So you have a relapse of the case with the same symptomatology plus a symptom

202
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:10,020
which indicates Medorrhinum. What you will do?

203
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:22,680
I repeated Sulphur. I prefer to be on the sure side.

204
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:32,340
You see Sulphur definitely worked beautifully for him and I was waiting for Medorrhinum

205
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:41,330
and here was my chance but we don't go according to our desire

206
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:48,100
but according to what the person's organism tells us.

207
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:55,260
Taking the fact that it was a full relapse and Sulphur had helped him,

208
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:02,970
inspite of the new symptom, I would not go and give Medorrhinum but I should wait

209
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:11,170
when symptoms have changed more and they go towards Medorrhinum.

210
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:14,380
That will be the time where I shall give Medorrhinum.

211
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:22,870
Still that was the last time on 30 of April 1980 that I saw him, still he is well

212
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:26,970
and I have not given him any other remedy.

213
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:32,050
Sulphur 200 again.

214
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:50,730
The second visit was one month after the first.

215
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,750
Not a full relapse as far as his intensity is concerned

216
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:48,040
that means he did not have so much severe pain and he did not have that severe itching.

217
00:35:53,970 --> 00:36:10,290
He had been for one a half or two months to the dentist and he had all this.

218
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:17,040
He waited because I said to him, you've been to the dentist,

219
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:21,150
we don't know if it's going to be a relapse.

220
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:28,450
He didn't come to the office immediately. He telephoned and I told him wait.

221
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:37,550
And then he was going worse and worse and then eventually he came to the office.

222
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:49,470
If we say 100 for the beginning, that was 65 or 70%

223
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:59,800
but the main thing is that the main constitutional symptoms

224
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:06,790
on which we prescribed Sulphur are back and then we were justified to give it.

225
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:23,770
If the relapse is total full and it's because of chemical interference,

226
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:33,380
I follow the law which is I repeat the same remedy, the same potency.

227
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:44,050
So this was a case where he had chemicals but if the relapse was full I could have given

228
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:48,300
and you could have gone a step higher in potency.

229
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:05,620
In case we have a relapse because of an interference with a chemical in the body

230
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:13,700
whatever it is, antibiotics, hormones, coffee etc. and you have a relapse,

231
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,440
you repeat the same remedy at the same potency.

232
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:30,620
If you have a relapse without interference, you step one higher

233
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:41,050
but if the remedy has worked beautifully and the person has a full relapse

234
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:48,780
absolutely as he was in the beginning, you may go in spite of the interference,

235
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:55,540
you may go one higher in case you have not given a high potency, like in this case.

236
00:38:55,640 --> 00:39:04,060
200 is not a very high potency; so you could have given 1M.

237
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:09,820
Usually the law is to repeat the remedy, to repeat the same potency.

238
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:29,290
After dental treatment many times within one week or two weeks or three weeks

239
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:35,290
there is a relapse and there is again a restoration of the health

240
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:40,890
without any interference at all. So you have to wait 3 weeks at least.

241
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:47,190
The more you can wait, the better. Six weeks is very good, if you can wait.

242
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:50,760
To persuade the person to wait, to see what happens

243
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:59,180
because the organism it may come back to the balanced condition.

244
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:21,600
It depends what kind of cheiropractic interference.

245
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:29,380
Strong cheiropractic interference perhaps it may have some effect.

246
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:43,180
The body has intelligence and if you have stimulated the body correctly,

247
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:50,530
supposing you gave the right remedy and the body wants to maintain an inflammation

248
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:57,110
at a certain point, on a joint for three months

249
00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:02,520
it's wrong to interfere with that pain.

250
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:14,750
If you know what you are doing with Homeopathy and the remedy has acted

251
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:28,510
you can say confidently that this pain is going to go away, just be patient or you give some placebo

252
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:34,070
but don't interfere with it.

253
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:39,920
But now you are having a person like that under homeopathic treatment,

254
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:47,920
he is doing well and then he climbs up a stair to fix something and falls down

255
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:55,170
or makes the wrong movement and then his back is hurt. That's another state.

256
00:41:55,270 --> 00:42:06,160
This condition can be interfered by cheiropract without interfering

257
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:11,050
the deeper action of the remedy.

258
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:21,750
Actually many times we would like to have that because in this case

259
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:24,420
this has happened exactly.

260
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:32,840
His daughter is a doctor who attended the classes and she telephoned

261
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:41,410
and said my father was climbing a stair to fix a curtain and he fall down

262
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:55,170
and he is now having severe pain on the back and she described an acute condition of Rhus tox.

263
00:42:56,650 --> 00:43:01,900
So he was in bed and he was very painful and I had to prescribe

264
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,960
and I did prescribe a dose of Rhus tox 200, which relieved him immediately.

265
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:20,460
If I had a cheiropractor, I would say you try to fix him.

266
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:29,110
I would rather have a cheiropractor fix that case than give a remedy if it was not correct.

267
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:37,620
In this case the symptomatology was absolutely clear and I had no doubt

268
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,450
that the remedy was correct.

269
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:42,360
In such a case you can give a remedy without fearing that the remedy

270
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:46,220
maybe interfering wrongly with the organism.

271
00:43:55,960 --> 00:44:01,200
Why not give him Calcarea? But he had symptoms of Rhus tox, not Calcarea.

272
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,610
It was not that.

273
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:24,530
-But you don't want to treat an acute case with a remedy very similar to constitutional remedy.

274
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,020
-Very similar.

275
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:51,240
If he gives me symptoms of Rhus tox clearly, I would give this.

276
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:56,870
We are going to talk about this problem tomorrow.

277
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:08,040
What we do when a person is under constitutional treatment and an acute arises.

278
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:15,120
What are we going to do? When to prescribe, when not to prescribe, when to wait etc?

279
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:28,970
We don't work very much with so low potencies.

280
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:38,550
I used to work with 30, 200, 1M, 10M, 50M. Very seldom I would use 12.

281
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:51,750
In such case I was certain that it was going to work and I gave 200 Rhus tox.

282
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:03,290
No more questions. Thank you.
