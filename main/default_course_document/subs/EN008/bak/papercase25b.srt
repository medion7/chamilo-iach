1
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:31,170
Here in case 14 with a 45 years old man with loss of voice,

2
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,600
partial paralysis of vocal chords.

3
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,900
This man had a very interesting but hard life.

4
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:00,650
At this time he was Director of a School for the hearing impaired and the teacher.

5
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,890
He had come to Athens from his village when he was 12 years old

6
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:08,320
and stayed with an uncle of his who treated him poorly.

7
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:16,310
At 13 his own parents were killed in a car crash and the poor boy was going around

8
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,910
from relative to relative.

9
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:23,730
He was a closed boy, did not show his emotions freely

10
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:28,240
and he was given to bouts of non stop weeping.

11
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:34,230
This continued until he was 18 years old when he finally got into the University.

12
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,730
At that time his life took a turn for the better.

13
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:43,480
He joined certain political functions where anarchist tendency was a leader amongst them.

14
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:49,340
He always stood up for the underdog and was the first to see whether a situation

15
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,410
was justly held or not.

16
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,280
He could not abide seeing suffering in others and was always there for the other person.

17
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:06,920
He was very empathic to other's suffering and he would go out of his way to alleviate the suffering.

18
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:12,850
Desires for fish, ice cream, smoked meat and especially bacon.

19
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:19,600
Here the decision should be between three remedies.

20
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:25,010
The one is Staphysagria, the other is Phosphorus and the other is Causticum.

21
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:40,760
If you wrote any of these you will get some marks.

22
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:49,350
Who wrote Staphysagria? No one.

23
00:02:50,850 --> 00:03:05,100
Who wrote Phosphorus? Who wrote Causticum? Who wrote another remedy?

24
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:18,660
Next case a woman passing 30 years old complaining for pain in the right scapula.

25
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,920
This began approximately three months ago and it bothers her

26
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:29,340
whenever she has to lift something heavy.

27
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,990
She also suffers from distention of the abdomen with much gas and

28
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:38,030
flatulence and she also has pain from varicose veins on her right leg.

29
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:47,430
All these symptoms are worse from 4-8.

30
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:53,520
About 5 months ago she also had problems with her gallbladder.

31
00:03:53,620 --> 00:04:00,750
She has stones in her gallbladder and she must be careful in her diet to avoid fat rich food.

32
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,590
As to her character this woman wants other people to listen to her

33
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,950
and she is angry when they do not.

34
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:13,250
She exerts quite a sphere of influence on her family and wants to run their lives.

35
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:18,100
She has a fear of snakes and sometimes dreams about them.

36
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,760
Desires sweets, hot drinks and aversion to cheese.

37
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:35,430
Between Lycopodium and Chelidonium, that is the choice.

38
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:47,910
You have strong symptoms of Lycopodium, worse 4-8, desires sweets, bloatedness

39
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:52,350
but you also have strong symptoms of Chelidonium.

40
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:16,000
That is what we discuss and aversion to cheese comes in favor for Chelidonium,

41
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:24,740
the pain in the right scapula comes in favor of Chelidonium and both they have

42
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:31,830
gallbladder problems, both desire warm drinks.

43
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:38,510
What will make you decide this way or that way?

44
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:46,510
She has no other fears except fear of snakes.

45
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,930
-I thing the character is very important.

46
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,830
-The character is very important.

47
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:55,660
In this case where you have the balance of physical symptoms,

48
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:03,250
you have the balance of two remedies almost equal but you have a description

49
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:09,250
of a type of a person who fits more this way or that way.

50
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:20,080
Then the balance is shifted towards that which gives weight to the remedy

51
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:26,770
due to the character situation.

52
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,850
Therefore in favor of Lycopodium or Chelidonium?

53
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:41,830
If we listen to what we know is in favor of Chelidonium and here we are prescribing

54
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:49,160
according to the Materia Medica and not according so much to the Repertorization.

55
00:06:50,940 --> 00:07:04,940
Who prescribed in favor of Lycopodium? Who prescribed in favor of Chelidonium?

56
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,250
Who prescribed another remedy, Lac caninum?

57
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:24,900
Because the fear of Lac Caninum is this enough here to balance the symptoms of Lachesis?

58
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,240
We don't have other symptoms of Lac caninum.

59
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:34,480
Therefore the decision should be Chelidonium first, if it does not act,

60
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,420
then you go to Lycopodium.

61
00:07:51,420 --> 00:08:01,650
Here the idea of 4-8 is it possible for another remedy to have 4-8?

62
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,490
Let me explain a little bit more the case.

63
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:11,330
Is it possible that other remedies have worse from 4-8?

64
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:16,830
It is possible. Is it possible that Chelidonium might have that aggravation.

65
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:27,570
It's also possible, it's not recorded but it is possible but there is another thing here

66
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:32,080
in this case, which is very apparent for me.

67
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:41,150
The case says that you will have to give first Chelidonium and then the pain in the right

68
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:51,820
scapula and psychologically she will feel better, still she may continue to have bloatedness

69
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,710
and still may continue to have worse 4-8.

70
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:07,670
In this case Lycopodium has to be given as a complementary to complete the cure of this case.

71
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:19,000
What you have to think is, I give first Chelidonium, if it does not work I'll go to Lycopodium.

72
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:27,340
If it does work and it leaves out Lycopodium symptoms, then OK Lycopodium and

73
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:34,420
Chelidonium are complementary, then I go to Chel. then I complete the picture.

74
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:43,250
I remember a case in Germany. Severe headaches in a woman, tremendous headaches

75
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:48,510
for 15-20 years, her life was ruined.

76
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:53,670
I prescribed Chelidonium and she had a tremendous reaction.

77
00:09:53,770 --> 00:10:04,910
She came after a few months for the follow up and the idea of Lycopodium was developing

78
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:12,850
and then most probably I felt she would go to Lycopodium and then to Pulsatilla.

79
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:22,500
The patient went out, I explained into the class and the practitioner who was treating

80
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,510
this patient a few years back, he was in the class.

81
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:37,580
I said that to the class and it was written of course in the video what I said because the

82
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:45,510
Expert System also had given Lycopodium and then Pulsatilla as the two best

83
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:50,850
prescriptions after six months of Chelidonium.

84
00:10:51,520 --> 00:11:01,590
She was still having pains, she was not cured, I explained to the class that that is developing,

85
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:06,580
Lycopodium is developing and most probably will be followed by Pulsatilla.

86
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:14,410
She is on video, all that I tell you is on video. She comes after again I'm back in Germany,

87
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:27,600
she comes for the follow up. She says I have to tell you that your remedy did not cure me.

88
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:37,590
So I went back to my practitioner who gave me first Lycopodium and then Pulsatilla and

89
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:50,080
now I'm well. I didn't say anything, I said OK, very good practitioner because I meant it,

90
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:55,160
he listened at least to the indications which I had given.

91
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:01,990
The only difference is that he did not tell her that that was explained in the class.

92
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:06,850
It was his decision but it's OK little things like that are totally forgivable,

93
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:10,100
as long as the patient is doing so well.

94
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:15,680
Then I went back to the video and I said to the class, do you remember?

95
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:26,920
Lycopodium and then Pulsatilla, so we do know that these remedies follow each other

96
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,350
and complete the action of each other.

97
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:46,920
-In this case the development of hers is friendly from Chelidonium to Lycopodium.

98
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:57,020
Can you give us some good marks to differentiate when we shall change the remedy?

99
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:06,760
Because differential diagnosis is very difficult. How to decide?

100
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:12,000
-So I come back to his questions when he says what are the indications,

101
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:17,260
when is the time to prescribe Lycopodium?

102
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:23,350
I say in this particular time once you see the changes, that means

103
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:28,920
the person feels better psychologically, the pain on the right scapula is not there

104
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:38,940
and perhaps the bloatedness is even worse or the general worse 4-8 is really established.

105
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:49,440
Even after a month you can give Lycopodium but there are other cases where you have to

106
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,850
wait until the development of Lycopodium.

107
00:13:53,950 --> 00:14:00,180
There is another possibility. You give Chelidonium and then it feels better all around,

108
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:06,260
better the bloatedness, I'm not so much down during 4-8,

109
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:14,020
you think the whole thing is developing, don't touch it by the time it's developing.

110
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:22,950
But now after six months comes back and says, now I feel 4-8...

111
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:30,690
my bloatedness starts again being great, that's the time when you prescribe Lycopodium.

112
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:40,840
-One can possible say that Lycopodium is working deeper, has a deeper action

113
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:46,020
and that one first should take the remedy that does not act deep,

114
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,530
does not hit the personality on such a deep level?

115
00:14:51,280 --> 00:15:03,010
-Yes you can say. Actually the remedy which finally brings about the total person

116
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:07,290
to another level, that remedy is the deepest.

117
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,740
It might be the third or fourth remedy that will do that.

118
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:21,520
Of course third or fourth not because you gave three wrong ones.

119
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:27,370
Because you gave three correct ones and the fourth correct one brings up the change.

120
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,680
-I decided for Lycopodium because you told us that the mental symptoms of Chelidonium

121
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:49,890
are not so sure and Lycopodium too can be a dictator.

122
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:58,680
The second thing is that at the time 4-8 is very important,

123
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:15,840
then there is the warm drinks that Lycopodium has and in case there is only a value of desire

124
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:26,770
for hot drinks second degree, the Lycopodium in the Repertory says that there is a pain

125
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:31,640
from the right hypochondrium to the scapula.

126
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:36,880
And it's a right sided remedy, so that was my decision for Lycopodium.

127
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:49,020
-Yes. You are right in a way because the case is structured in such a way as to confuse.

128
00:16:50,980 --> 00:17:02,490
What I say is that you have to read through the lines in the case.

129
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:14,430
If we said here she is a dictator in the family where outside she is a cowardice,

130
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:19,620
you are absolutely right and there will be no question about Lycopodium.

131
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:28,010
But in this way that it is structured the case, it's expressing the idea of Chelidonium more

132
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:36,520
than Lycopodium. Lycopodium also has some fears, what will be the fears of Lycopodium?

133
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:42,680
You are asking. If this person develops fears, the fears of Lycopodium

134
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:50,440
will take the turn of Lycopodium, not they will take the turn of Lachesis.

135
00:17:51,480 --> 00:18:00,270
So she has some fears but the fears do not belong to Lycopodium, also she runs the family,

136
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:08,510
she has some opinions but it shows a powerful person, not a weak person which

137
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:14,530
shows Lycopodium. Otherwise we would have some indications in the case.

138
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:29,290
-What would have been if we would not have the information about the character?

139
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,680
-Then Lycopodium.

140
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:41,200
-If we had to choose between aversion to cheese and the time, what would be the main?

141
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,430
-If you did not have any information about the character,

142
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:47,870
then the prescription should be Lycopodium.

143
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:05,850
You have more symptoms on the physical level, the balance is in favor of Lycopodium.

144
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:12,600
On the mental symptoms the balance is in favor of Chelidonium.

145
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:20,520
That's why the balance is shifted, without the mental symptoms at all but with desires,

146
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:25,030
you have to prescribe Lycopodium.

147
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,610
-May I say something?

148
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:40,600
-I want to make observation between this case and the case we should do tonight

149
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,920
at Argentum nitricum.

150
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:53,700
Here we have a very special physical pathology and this is the varicose veins in the right leg.

151
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:57,020
They are potentially life threatening.

152
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:05,930
I don't see in the Repertory, Chelidonium under varicose in the legs.

153
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:12,680
So my question is if we have to choose what is to be cured in this case,

154
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:20,280
actually I would say that potentially from those varicose we might have troubles.

155
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:27,030
Like for example pulmonary emboli or something like this.

156
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:36,040
Maybe we should either add as an official addition Chelidonium in the Repertory

157
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:40,050
for the varicose veins of the right leg or give Lycopodium to this case.

158
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:43,980
-No, it's not like this.

159
00:20:48,390 --> 00:21:02,170
When you have some pathology which does not belong to the remedy,

160
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,720
it does not mean that this pathology will not be cured by the remedy.

161
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:12,280
It means that most probably is going to be cured by the remedy.

162
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:27,950
If it is not cured by the remedy, Chelidonium has acted, then Lycopodium has acted and

163
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:36,620
the varicose veins are staying, that means that the next remedy in order to touch that level

164
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,950
it's Pulsatilla which comes as a complementary to Lycopodium and then

165
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:47,720
you have symptoms of Pulsatilla.

166
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,950
Varicose veins do not endanger death, I have not seen that.

167
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:57,500
-I have seen that.

168
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,450
-Excuse me for interrupting but I wanted to clarify something.

169
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:13,120
Before I translated the question of a lady who spoke German.

170
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:19,370
The question was does Lycopodium acts on a deeper level than Chelidonium which you said yes.

171
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:23,910
But I understood her question in such a way that her question was,

172
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:28,950
would you suggest to use as a first remedy the one that does not act

173
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:32,540
as deeply on the psychological level?

174
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,980
Is that the reason why you start with Chelidonium? That I wanted to correct.

175
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,030
-It's good that you make this explanation.

176
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:48,290
I don't suggest that in cases you give a superficial remedy first and then you give a deeper

177
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:51,900
remedy, no. Not at al.

178
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:59,430
I say that you have to choose the uppermost layer, what information you have.

179
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:02,120
This is the uppermost, you use it.

180
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,370
If this uppermost is a polychrest, use it.

181
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:17,110
If the uppermost is a remedy which indicated or a small remedy or superficial, give it.

182
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:23,120
It's the correct remedy and it will act. Don't worry.

183
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:29,760
It will act. It may not act curatively totally but it will take it to the next remedy

184
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:35,350
and then you can say the next remedy took away everything, it is deeper.

185
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:42,270
Yes it is deeper, in a way you can say it is deeper but give always the remedy

186
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:51,280
which comes out of information from the patient at the moment.

187
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:06,680
-I meant my question another way. I wanted to say if there was the same information

188
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:13,930
for both remedies to choose, is it more important to use the chemistry,

189
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:21,980
so to use the aversion or is it more important to use the time, as a deciding factor?

190
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:34,450
-No. It's equal important. Your choice then could be only on intensity.

191
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:41,070
If it is very clear, underlined 3 times worse 4-8, forget it.

192
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:51,750
If on the other hand this is not so clear but the aversion for cheese is very strong,

193
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:59,840
absolutely and then you have the scapula, then the balance will shift towards Chelidonium.

194
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:05,510
So the intensity and the clearness of a symptom will determine your choice.

195
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:21,000
-If we give Chelidonium to this case and then it begins to move towards Lycopodium,

196
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:30,330
should we observe that the person from a powerful one is becoming a coward?

197
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:33,160
And this is a cure or not?
-No.

198
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,860
-I still don't understand.

199
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,910
-You don't have to have mental pathology after that.

200
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:47,500
What I say, some of the pathology which is there, physical pathology is left over,

201
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,740
which is covered by Lycopodium then you can give it.

202
00:25:51,840 --> 00:26:01,170
The question is in all cases do you have to have mental pathology? The answer is no.

203
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:09,910
You don't have to have mental pathology in all cases, not at all.

204
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:14,330
Emotionally and mentally people can be quite balanced

205
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:20,330
and suffering a lot in their physical body. You don't have to have mental pathology.

206
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:26,010
A Lycopodium may not have at all the character that we described.

207
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:32,080
In mental-emotional it might be totally balanced and we have only physical symptoms.

208
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,740
Then you treat the physical symptoms.

209
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:39,080
You don't have to have mental-emotional in every case.

210
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:44,830
That has to be very clear because then that is another misunderstanding coming from my teaching.

211
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:54,490
When I teach like this and my students say, George said prescribe only on essence.

212
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:58,660
What is essence? Mental-emotional picture.

213
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:03,820
When I heard eventually that after 2-3 years I said, no for god's sake don't say that,

214
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,790
I did not say that.

215
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:11,740
I gave some mental-emotional structure of some remedies, it does not mean

216
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,740
that you have to prescribe only on that.

217
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:19,410
Because you will get a Lachesis that has no jealousy, no envy, it will be a very nice person

218
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:24,170
and you will miss it. You will say he is so nice, how can I give Lachesis?

219
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:29,010
Of course because he is balanced in this level.

220
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:34,490
Like somebody who is balanced in his physical body

221
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:39,660
and you say how can I give Lycopodium to a person who does not have bloatedness

222
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,740
and his liver is functioning.

223
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:48,500
No, you can give because the mental-emotional picture is Lycopodium. This is clear.
