1
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,610
-The draft will affect you?

2
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:34,570
-I would prefer not to be in a draft.

3
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:45,270
He says I do not tolerate the cold-wet but I can not sit in the sun as well but

4
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,310
a hot bath I enjoy.

5
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:54,610
So when it is warm-wet maybe he likes it,

6
00:00:54,710 --> 00:01:00,690
when the heat of the sun dries him up maybe he does not like it.

7
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:06,770
So after taking into consideration all the explanation he is giving about the weather

8
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:16,530
we do not see a contra-indication really for Causticum.

9
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,600
-We were down eating dinner and it was a kind of chilly in the afternoon and

10
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:34,630
I found that my fingers were aching from the cold and it's not very cold.

11
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:42,070
In the winter I don't go out very much.

12
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:28,570
Why this pause? What am I thinking?

13
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:40,220
You would have stopped perhaps the consultation. Causticum is all right long time ago.

14
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:48,220
But I still continue to search and my mind pictures that may fit this whole picture.

15
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:57,210
Maybe still I have to ask something else, there is another remedy that may fit that

16
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,830
 picture except of Causticum,

17
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:08,800
if we are completely wrong on Causticum and what is the other remedy?

18
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:17,300
There is a remedy that you don't know very well but it fits somewhat of the case.

19
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,550
It fits the case because I know the remedy somewhat.

20
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,810
You don't know the remedy in the mental-emotional picture but

21
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:35,550
 you may know the remedy in its physical manifestations.

22
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:44,550
That remedy I'm thinking has a lot of suicidal tendencies,

23
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:58,640
strong suicidal which I don't see in him. Let's see, continue.

24
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:12,970
-If I get irritated, agitated, if I have to carry something heavy and it's very hot,

25
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:24,730
my hands get ret and they itch, they swell up and it also seems they have too much sugar.

26
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:29,890
If there is too much sugar, it seems I start to get the swelling.

27
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:34,720
My feet swell and get red. I used to get a lot of hives in my leg,

28
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,720
I don't get them anymore.

29
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,720
Another point for Causticum.

30
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:46,060
Causticum does not like sugar because it has a lot of energy without sugar,

31
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,800
so if he takes sugar, the energy is too much and it burns itself.

32
00:04:52,610 --> 00:05:00,270
It's too high. The same with coffee. The energy is too high.

33
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:05,190
Therefore there is an aversion to sugar.

34
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:09,190
The organism says don't give me a ready made sugar because I'll burn it quickly and

35
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:19,940
 then you have problems.
It says no sugar.

36
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:35,020
If we were in a school, for instance, I would say put down all the symptoms.

37
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:43,270
We have a lot of new symptoms like smoked fish. He likes smoked fish.

38
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:48,510
Smoked meat is for Causticum, what about smoked fish?

39
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:52,520
And we will see it again and again, we will verify it.

40
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:58,270
Put it down as aggravation from sugar, another symptom which Causticum may have.

41
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:06,270
That's why I say if there was a bank where we could put the information,

42
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:09,010
then we give the remedy, then we take the feedback.

43
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,510
What happened to that symptom?

44
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:21,100
Then we complete our Materia Medicas, we make them much more complete and

45
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,600
that's why there is a need for organized education because

46
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,180
if there is a really organized education...

47
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:33,770
I would never sit down myself and note it down and take into consideration and

48
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:44,100
then search it, I cant' do it anymore.
I used to do in the old days.

49
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:53,850
I don't know if I will be ever in old age but anyhow.

50
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:04,050
-Whenever I take a bath, I'll be covered with hives all over my legs after bath.

51
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:09,930
-After any bath whether it is warm or cold?

52
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:18,930
-Usually a bath will make it worse.

53
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,960
-Perspiration?

54
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:26,480
-I don't perspire very much.

55
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:32,980
-Do you lose your voice from time to time? Do you have hoarseness?

56
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,090
-No, I only had hoarseness once.

57
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,090
-Any warts?
-No.

58
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:42,600
-What kind of vaccinations you had?

59
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:52,310
-Small pox vaccination and I don't know if this was the result of

60
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:55,900
what my brother was doing to me but it would never heal up,

61
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,150
he used to walk up and punch it my vaccination

62
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:05,980
and I had vaccination for a very long time, a big swelling.

63
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:12,020
-A big scar that was irritated by your brother punching it.

64
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:19,260
-Yes and I'm sure I had all the other vaccinations like measles.

65
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:31,900
What he says what reminds you about his vaccination?

66
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:50,400
Another thing concerning the remedy?
-Staphysagria.

67
00:08:53,330 --> 00:09:01,150
-It reminds you of Staphysagria. Can you imagine the child with a wound and

68
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,650
the brother punching again and again.

69
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:10,900
He says it wouldn't heal because my brother kept on punching the wound.

70
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,820
-Younger brother?

71
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:26,650
-Younger or older! You perceive the suppression, you perceive the type of person,

72
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,400
 he was not able to defend himself.

73
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:37,620
He would just sit there and being punched.

74
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,400
-You are from Canada?

75
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,180
-Yes.

76
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:08,900
-Your nails they have any problem?

77
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,890
-I did have when I was really sick,

78
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:19,890
they were just breaking all the time and they were thin but now they are quite strong.

79
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:23,900
-How do you sleep? In what position, left, right?

80
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,610
-I used to sleep on my left but that makes my bowels worse.

81
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:34,560
On my left immediately I had bowel movements but I have four bowel movements when

82
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:40,560
I go to bed and then I sleep for an hour, I wake up, go to the toilet,

83
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:44,400
go to sleep for maybe half an hour, wake up.

84
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:52,410
It's really bad, I wake up every 15 min.

85
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:57,150
It's also worse from pressure, if I press my abdomen, if I take something heavy and

86
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:05,680
ghave it on my abdomen, the chances are a couple of minutes later I have to go to the toilet.

87
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:08,760
And eating, worse after eating.

88
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:16,340
If I had some food right now I could probably induce a stool by just eating.

89
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,840
As soon as I start eating I have to run to the toilet.

90
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,600
So everybody at home they are used to when I eat or

91
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,600
I go out with friends I always sit near the toilet because

92
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:32,100
I will have to go three times.

93
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:42,100
-You said the desire for fish; actually the desire is for fresh fish or for smoked fish.

94
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:50,090
-During really the bad time it will be for smoked fish.

95
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:55,590
-And you said smoked oysters.

96
00:11:55,690 --> 00:12:01,040
-Those are the only ones we have in Canada. I've never had fresh oysters,

97
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:08,460
 so I don't know.

98
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:50,280
-Would you say that you have periods of depression?

99
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:55,400
-Not depression but melancholy.

100
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,640
-The melancholy is not very painful.

101
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:07,610
-No, it's kind of enjoyable.

102
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:11,400
-Do you fall in love easily with a woman? Ah, you are married.

103
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:18,370
-I'm married but I was very romantic before I got married.

104
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:23,900
-When you had a relationship you wanted a very romantic relationship?

105
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,900
-Oh yes, every girl I had I would give a ring always,

106
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,120
I could never just go out with a girl and go to bed.

107
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:42,610
It was always romantic, I'm very romantic. She used to love it because

108
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:59,620
I get very romantic and sing and dance with her, she is great.

109
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:10,120
You see how I learn about remedies? This way. And if I speak much more,

110
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,060
I ask more questions, I learn all the aspects,

111
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:23,970
the inside and the outside.

112
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:32,280
Because I'm very attentive, very perceptive, I understand more than what he says.

113
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,860
He says one thing and I perceive where exactly he exaggerates, how much,

114
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:41,370
a little bit exaggeration here, he withholds information there,

115
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:48,860
all these are taken into consideration, not only what he says, whoever is in front of me.

116
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,620
I'm taking into consideration everything that takes place on all levels,

117
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,360
on a sub-conscious level, on a level which is not spoken out.

118
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,360
 I take it into consideration and

119
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:03,330
yes it's different from one remedy to the other and no it's different,

120
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:08,270
just one word, he pronounces it differently.

121
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:12,510
Why I ask the last questions? The possibility of Aurum maybe.

122
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:23,000
But you see the person is not depressed and he says melancholic and all that

123
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,660
 but it is romantic.

124
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:36,670
He enjoys almost the romanticism.

125
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:44,670
How can I describe this when I give a lecture and says give us the Materia Medica.

126
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:55,500
I try my best but never I can describe it in the way you see it actually happening.

127
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,270
It is beautiful.

128
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:03,510
I read you a remedy now and you tell me which is the remedy.

129
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:10,000
It says the use of this drug in Homeopathy has been confined to the action of the

130
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,840
alimentary tract.

131
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:21,080
It produces a diarrhea very similar to Croton, Croton tiglium has been given to him.

132
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,370
-Gambogia.

133
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:36,090
-Very good. Gambogia. From the pathogenesis it is very evident that it has very intense

134
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:44,830
and definite action especially on the gastro-enteric tract.

135
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:50,700
Great irritability of the stomach, burning, smarting and dryness of the tongue and throat,

136
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:59,040
pain in the stomach after food, tenderness in the epigastrium, pain and distention of

137
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:07,530
abdomen, flatulence after stool, rumbling and rolling with pain in sacral region,

138
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:14,120
diarrhea with sudden and forcible ejection of bilious stools,

139
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:19,120
tenesmus after with burning at anus.

140
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:28,120
This is the remedy yes. This might be the remedy but it is not the remedy that

141
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,250
 we should prescribe.

142
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:34,260
Logically we must prescribe Causticum. Why?

143
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,250
Let's go back to the beginning, we have somebody who can not retain his stool.

144
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:42,040
He says I'm holding my anus to run because the anus cannot hold,

145
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:53,000
it is paralyzed on the sphincter, he has to hold the anus to go and have a stool.

146
00:17:53,100 --> 00:18:03,950
It is Causticum. Then he comes up with a story which shows Causticum.

147
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:07,200
Can you go and give Gambogia? No.

148
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:13,660
You have to give Causticum with a possibility of after Causticum developing a picture of

149
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:26,160
Staphysagria and then maybe you have a beautiful cure.

150
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,500
-Gambogia has suicidal tendency?

151
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:41,430
-Yes very strong, depression tremendous. It is not written in the books.

152
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:48,580
The mental picture of Gambogia is one of promiscuity, a lot of aggressive energy inside,

153
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:54,200
like him. Promiscuous and at the same time suicidal, they don't want to live,

154
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:59,700
it's a crazy remedy, very strong. I will describe it to you once in the Materia Medica,

155
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,450
 you will see it.

156
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:09,350
Not today, I just give you a few information.

157
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:19,330
What do you think now of Causticum? Do you understand the analysis?

158
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:31,580
Is anybody who does not understand? Nobody, very good.

159
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:57,430
-After all these remedies he had.... how can you recognize...

160
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:05,120
-Can you be sure? That's why you have to be sure. If you are sure about the remedy,

161
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:10,340
 the remedy is going to do the right thing. There is no question about that.

162
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:19,080
The main thing is are we sure? To my understanding the remedy fortunately it appears

163
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:27,670
still to be there though with special accent on Phosphorus but my question is after having

164
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:35,660
a lot of Phosphorus high potencies, which is close to Causticum, is it possible that

165
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:42,670
the Phosphorus symptoms have been accentuated a bit more? Maybe.

166
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:53,170
Apart from the fact that he has a pathology which requires a lot of water, for instance.

167
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:58,870
I believe that if you analyze a case like that...

168
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:05,620
I have not seen ever in my practice a thing like that.

169
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:12,420
How is it that I have not seen it and I've treated so many cases?

170
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:21,750
Because I knew the Theory quite well. I think I avoided most of the mistakes,

171
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:28,500
which others do because I know the Theory very well.

172
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,000
-What about Ferrum phosphoricum?

173
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,590
-For this case?

174
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:45,680
What about Ferrum Phosphoricum? I said why?

175
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:50,440
Because he has many Phosphorus symptoms and many symptoms of Ferrum phosphoricum.

176
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,470
Which are the symptoms of Ferrum Phosphoricum in him?

177
00:21:56,430 --> 00:22:10,800
-In the beginning weakness and bloody stool, change of mind, alternate moods.

178
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:21,770
-Not enough.

179
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:25,660
-George would you give Stramonium for dancing and cursing?

180
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:36,670
-Stramonium is not going to be alternating.

181
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:43,160
Stramonium is wild, when he had the fights he would have mentioned that

182
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,420
 he hurt many people.

183
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,660
I almost sent somebody to the hospital.

184
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:55,920
I almost killed somebody by punching him.

185
00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:02,920
You will get much more violence. Tremendous fear of the dark.

186
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:07,920
Causticum has fear of the dark but not as strong as Stramonium.

187
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,910
Do you have fear of the dark?

188
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:14,160
-No.

189
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:17,670
-Calcarea phosphorica?

190
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:32,120
-No. If you noticed he has a lot of energy inside and he is intense and

191
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:45,910
the energy is coming up easily, fast. Calcarea phosphorica is tired, tired, tired.

192
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:52,920
He is not all the time tired. He says if I sleep four hours, good sleep, energy.

193
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,540
-Phosphorus?

194
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:00,830
-Phosphorus yes it can be like that.

195
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:15,890
-Do you know why? Do you have any idea why they saw the need to make such a remedy?

196
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:22,750
-I don't know.

197
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:49,160
-There is one possibility. Mixing Sulphur and Calcarea carbonica...

198
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:54,860
-According to his understanding, which is quite logical, he saw mixings of Calcarea and

199
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:03,700
Sulphur with Hepar sulphur and in this same way, in this same frame of mind he saw

200
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:09,800
Causticum by mixing Cal. carb and Sulphate of potassium.

201
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:16,690
In this way we might say that he tried some combination of remedies.

202
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:26,610
He was a mixer, mixopathy!

203
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:31,400
The difference is that he proved this and he gave it according to the proving.

204
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:35,650
We can mix five remedies together and give it according to their proving.

205
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:43,650
There is nothing wrong with that, as long as we do it correctly and scientifically.

206
00:25:43,750 --> 00:26:12,530
-Ammonium carbonicum for the respiratory problems and the bleeding of the anus?

207
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:17,380
-But many remedies have the respiratory troubles and bleeding from the anus and

208
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:23,220
Ammonium carbonicum is a remedy which is indicated mostly when the heart is involved,

209
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:29,160
when the thyroid is involved. We have another symptomatology all together,

210
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:39,920
we don't see the symptomatology of Ammonium carbonicum here.

211
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,420
-Which potency?

212
00:26:43,520 --> 00:27:01,250
-What do you say? Let me hear some of you.

213
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:09,460
-200.

214
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,470
-200.

215
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:15,510
-200.

216
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:18,840
-I have to obey to the majority.

217
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:29,570
-It appears to be sensitive, he may have severe bleeding.

218
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:42,670
-We should be careful but I don't think 200 is too high potency.

219
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:53,160
We could have started with one dose of 30 but I will not go and give 12 here.

220
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:56,420
A dose of 30 is the most sensitive,

221
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:01,890
a dose of 200 is the highest that you can go.

222
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:11,170
We must not go higher until we see the reaction from this remedy.

223
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:22,000
So tell your homeopath to give you a dose of Causticum 200 and observe correctly.

224
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:37,750
Did you like the case?
-Yes.

225
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:51,240
-Do you think that you learned from that case?
-Yes.

226
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:57,670
-Staphysagria?

227
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:06,150
-I would say that this person most probably will need Staphysagria maybe after 9 months

228
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:19,380
or a year or two years even but at some point also he will need Tuberculinum again.

229
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:26,220
But when I will give Tuberculinum, I will have the symptoms to give it. This is different.

230
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:34,220
I would expect that underneath there is a tubercular miasm, most probably that's why

231
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:39,720
he was so sensitive to Tuberculinum and reacted into such a deep manner.

232
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:45,970
We most probably are going to see the tubercular miasm and

233
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:50,710
we may have seen it in the father,

234
00:29:50,810 --> 00:30:00,970
not so much psychosis as tuberculosis that may have brought about the mental derangement.

235
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:12,060
This is only a conjecture. What I can say for sure is how we start. This is a supposition.

236
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:19,300
I suppose that he will need Staphysagria. I suppose, it is not absolutely certain.

237
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:25,800
According to what we see, the logic of that, the analysis will point out that

238
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,310
he will need Staphysagria. That's all.

239
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:32,300
I'm not saying give it anyhow.

240
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:37,570
Because many times Causticum,

241
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:44,300
then with the least thing Staphysagria and then it is a mistake.

242
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:48,560
-Do you give up Medorrhinum all together?

243
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:52,560
-No points of Medorrhinum.

244
00:30:52,660 --> 00:31:03,230
-Is any inimical state with Phosphorus?

245
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:15,330
-An inimical will be if Causticum is acting and during the action of Causticum do not give

246
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:25,090
Phosphorus but it may go to Staphysagria and then to Phosphorus, this can happen.

247
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:31,700
But during the action of Causticum be careful not to give Phosphorus because

248
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,040
it may upset matters.

249
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:41,770
The inimical action has been devised by this fact,

250
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:48,000
by this kind of cases where people would show opposites effects from what they thought.

251
00:31:48,100 --> 00:32:00,670
Phosphorus perforated the guts and brought about the peritonitis.

252
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:06,670
-With 10M what would happen?

253
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:10,670
-Perhaps a very strong reaction.

254
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,760
-Any prognosis?

255
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:37,740
-About the prognosis? I don't like to make prognosis, I don't like prophesies.

256
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:47,990
I will tell you what it says my experience in this case, hoping that the remedy is correct,

257
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:56,740
he will be 50% better within three months. He will still have some loose stool but

258
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:02,980
they will be less, the stool will start forming and

259
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:17,580
he will have an initial aggravation not more than 2-3 days, if he has.

260
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:26,020
So he will get better and better, when he will be completely well in Chron's disease in

261
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:34,230
that severity, two years from now, if we treat correctly,

262
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:38,740
we give one remedy after the other correctly.

263
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:49,540
Maybe I'm totally out, maybe tomorrow well.
I don't know.
