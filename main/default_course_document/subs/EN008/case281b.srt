1
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:28,250
-I just agree that I will go on with Lycopodium.

2
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,750
-Because you took the remedy and you thought the remedy was correct.

3
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:40,580
-Because I had less cough because I had coughing nearly all my life.

4
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:54,580
So it's still very little cough. At home this summer has been very warm, so no cold.

5
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,830
I think cold is worse for me.

6
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:03,580
-When there is cold it aggravates.
-Yes, cold draft.

7
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:13,830
-But still from January until today you have very little cough, the cough has improved.

8
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:23,330
-Yes, I had very much cough 1 year ago here, I had a lot of cough in May here.

9
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,330
-But you took a remedy before coming here...
-Yes in January.

10
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:46,830
-And when you came here we decided that the remedy was acting, you had to let it act.

11
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:55,830
-Yes because I stopped crying with the remedy.

12
00:01:55,930 --> 00:02:01,090
-You stopped crying with the remedy and some other things had improved

13
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:08,930
and we decided not to give you another remedy, to continue with the same.

14
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,680
Now after May how is your chest?

15
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:19,680
-It's very good, just a little bit here when it's cold in the evening

16
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:25,680
and especially yesterday afternoon was lots of people smoking outside and it was

17
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,190
a little draft and I noticed a little bit.

18
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:42,890
-With the draft you feel more coughing?
-Yes, it's always like that but I was very thirsty.

19
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:56,840
-You were but now you are not?
-No, I drink maybe 8 lit of water when it's hot.

20
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,340
-In your country you mean?

21
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:06,090
-No, this summer I drink a little less but I drink a lot when it's hot.

22
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:13,590
But it's more less now this time, here. I drink maybe 3 lt.

23
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:17,340
-And you drink small quantities or big quantities?

24
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,530
-Big yes.

25
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:29,510
-So you are very thirsty still but less thirsty than a year ago or something.

26
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,610
-Yes.

27
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,310
-Thirsty for cold water?

28
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:49,610
-It was but it changed, not so more because I noticed that very cold water aggravates the cough.

29
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,010
-Cold and draft and cold water aggravates the cold.

30
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,610
-And tobacco smoke.

31
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:14,440
-How many years you had the cough?
-Since my first pregnancy and that is 27 years.

32
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,590
-And this is the first time that you feel better?

33
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:30,840
-It's periods all the time, it's not always but for months it could be every day, several months.

34
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:35,590
Before, some years ago it could be for several months. My first pregnancy I thought

35
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:41,440
I will lose the baby because I coughed and coughed and coughed. I had to hold myself to ...

36
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,190
-How do you feel otherwise?

37
00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:03,020
-The last time I was very sad, a lot of sadness, depression because I break up a relationship.

38
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,370
It's better but it's still there.

39
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:14,520
-Do you sigh a lot?
-Yes, I think so.

40
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,660
-A lot?
-Sometimes yes.

41
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:33,120
-Do you cry or you can not?
-Oh yes, I can cry.

42
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,870
-How much you can cry? A lot?

43
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:50,620
-2 years ago when I first broke up, I had break up twice, I cried every day for half year.

44
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:05,520
I asked for this separating, we were not married but when he walked out from the house

45
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:10,120
I started crying. I knew I will do that.

46
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:17,770
-So that means you sent him away but you still loved him?

47
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,120
-Yes.

48
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:26,020
-And when he left, then you started loving him even more.

49
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:34,520
-Yes. The first time and maybe this time too but little less because I tried to work

50
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:40,520
with it all the time but it's still very hard.

51
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:46,520
-Did you take Ignatia before?
-I don't think so.

52
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,360
-You never took Ignatia?
-No.

53
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:55,960
-Nat. mur?
-One time before Lycopodium.

54
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:05,160
It was a clever person saying to me take one dose Nat mur before you start Lycopodium.

55
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:09,910
-What potency was the Nat mur?
-200.

56
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:17,600
And that man said I should take it for 5 days one dose every day but I don't think I took it.

57
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,240
I took 2-3 doses.

58
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,120
-Did you feel any effect from Nat mur?

59
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:43,610
-I just wait so little after it, so I'm not sure but I did a mistake in August. I should take

60
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:51,110
something for my knee, I was walking in the mountain and something happened,

61
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,370
I don't know why.

62
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:56,060
-In your knee?
-Yes, in the left knee.

63
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:04,770
Before if it was something, it was always the right knee. Something starting and I should take Ruta

64
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:16,790
and by mistake I take Causticum and in 2 minutes I feel so sad. Everything was heavy,

65
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:20,780
I lost all my energy, everything was real bad.

66
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:26,370
-Did you know it was a mistake already?
-Yes.

67
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:30,020
-When did you realize it was a mistake?

68
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,870
-Right after because I had some small marks in the acute.

69
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:43,100
-So immediately after taking you say, I made a mistake that I took Caust and then you took Ruta?

70
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,450
-When I came home. I wait.

71
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:52,450
-And then you became sad?
-I was sad. The sadness stayed.

72
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:58,850
-So you are still in that sadness?
-I take Lycopodium again.

73
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:02,520
I had to take it because I couldn't stand the situation.

74
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,550
-And Lycopodium helped you this time?

75
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:12,520
-Yes, it helped me but I feel always I had to repeat it quite often.

76
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,520
-How many times you have to repeat it?

77
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:24,040
-Sometimes it works for 3-4 weeks but sometimes I have to take another one in 1 week.

78
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:28,780
I have done that. I have taken up to 10.

79
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,020
-10M?
-Yes the last one was 200.

80
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,860
-And then down again to 200.
-Yes.

81
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,480
-Except of this sadness is anything else at this moment that is bothering you

82
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,530
and a little bit of cough?

83
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:53,230
-Bad sleep. Sometimes it's quite good. It's periods.

84
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:56,330
-It varies.
-Yes.

85
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:17,990
-Your mood is always sad or it can change?
-It changes very fast.

86
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:22,670
If I have good time, company, everything is OK.

87
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:28,250
-And then back again?
-I don't like to be by myself.

88
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:39,750
I would wish I would like it more because it's a big problem for me to stay in a big house alone.

89
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:43,730
-With children?
-They have grown up.

90
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,320
-They left the house. They don't live in the same house with you?

91
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,420
-No.

92
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:56,820
-So why you sent this man away? Why you tell him to go?

93
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,480
Because he didn't want to marry you officially?
-No, no, no.

94
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:11,230
He is 11 years younger than me and his mental state was different.

95
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:19,730
I want everything and he wants nothing. He just watches television and work, so we can't talk.

96
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:27,230
-He was working this man?
-Oh yes he works very much.

97
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:32,730
-And then comes home and sees television, that's all.

98
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:35,480
-Yes or work in the house.

99
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:48,980
-As well. So? I don't understand still why you ... since you liked him.

100
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:55,230
Did he get another woman, did you find out that he was going with another woman,

101
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:59,980
did you tell you that he wanted to leave?

102
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:05,830
-No, but we were quite agreed that we weren't alike.

103
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:12,330
-Mentally you were different?
-Very different.

104
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:22,080
-He was very untidy?
-No, in a way too tidy.

105
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:31,230
-He seems to be the perfect man, why you ...? I don't understand.

106
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:40,150
Inside you, you were afraid you would get hurt one day because he was younger and then you said

107
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:44,650
it's better to send him away now because I don't suffer later on?

108
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:51,900
-Maybe. Because in the beginning, 10 years ago, he was just 24 and he had no children

109
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:59,150
he had not been married, I had been married twice with children, a small grand child.

110
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:09,400
So 10 years ago I didn't want this but it started and in between I go back with another man.

111
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:16,080
I lived with another man for 10 years and I go back to him and married him.

112
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,260
Nearly 2 years we were married.

113
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,230
-2 years ago you were married?

114
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:29,380
-No, it was 8-9 years ago and this last man, the young one...

115
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,630
-You met this man, you let him one time, you managed to leave him one time,

116
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,880
you got married to another man, then you went back to him?

117
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:44,790
-No. I lived with another man for 10 years.

118
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,970
-Before him or after him?
-Before.

119
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:56,460
And we break up and I met this young man in the mean time and I go back to the other again

120
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,220
and marry him.
-To the first one.

121
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:10,560
-Yes but I liked the young one better but the other was more safe and he was very sad.

122
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:21,710
-Then you left him again and you went back to the young man again, correct?

123
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,810
-Correct.

124
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,460
-And then you stayed with him 2 more years.

125
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:39,990
-No, we lived together 2 years, we started living together after that for 6 years.

126
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:44,490
-And then you decide if I stay with him, he is going to leave me one day

127
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:48,200
and then I'm going to feel very hurt?

128
00:14:48,300 --> 00:15:01,050
-Maybe but we had been so very unlike people, we have the sensitive, we have the love that stuff.

129
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:11,970
-You mean the erotic was good but mentally you felt it's different.

130
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,620
He was irresponsible, he was young, he would have another affair one day and then...

131
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:27,300
-Yes, I feel maybe he needs to have children.

132
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,800
-I see now.

133
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,370
Do you eat fruits?

134
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:46,620
-No, I like it in a way but it aggravates me very much, bloated but after Lycopodium

135
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:55,380
the bloating is much better. Before I had bloating with other food, with milk products

136
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:02,220
I can't take them. Still I cant' take them I can take a little bit.

137
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:13,720
-How much do you need sweets?
-No, I like the spicy.

138
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:33,880
I like the smoked salmon, especially with mustard sauce and I like other smoked things too

139
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,710
but I don't eat pork.

140
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:39,370
-Why?
-I don't eat pork anymore.

141
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:44,370
-Why? For religious reasons?
-It was for health.

142
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:50,620
I had some pain in the joints and somebody told me don't eat pork, so I stopped eating

143
00:16:50,720 --> 00:17:05,300
and my ex-husband was nearly a vegetarian, he didn't eat pork.

144
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:18,950
So it was 2 reasons but I like smokes and I like olives. I love the Greek salad,

145
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:27,800
there are lots of olives and onion. I like all kinds of onions.

146
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:33,700
-Onions do not bother you?
-Yes before but it's better.

147
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,880
-Not so much now.

148
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:50,360
If you wanted to describe yourself now, what would you say, how you would describe yourself?

149
00:17:52,050 --> 00:18:02,270
-I feel I'm quite open person, I like to talk to people but in a way I'm a little timid too.

150
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:14,310
It's better if people start talking to me first but I think I'm quite open and social.

151
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:22,270
I can talk a lot, if we start, I can talk about everything.

152
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:44,100
I had great desire company when I was a child too, I haven't sister and brother

153
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:52,690
and my mother was quite sick and I used to go to the neighbor to eat because there was a lot of children.

154
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,690
-So you always liked being with others.
-Yes being in a big family.

155
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,690
-How much salt do you need now?

156
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:22,200
-Actually I don't think it's just the salt, it's more the spicy.

157
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:29,190
But I like salty things too.

158
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:41,020
-Are you afraid of anything? You have any fears?
-A little bit claustrophobia.

159
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:51,020
-Dark?
-No, not anymore but I'm quite restless in a way.

160
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:58,590
Before when I was sitting in the course

161
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:09,860
I was with the legs... but after Lycopodium it's better and I'm in a way more lazy.

162
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:25,500
-When you have this sleeplessness, it is the whole night that you can not sleep

163
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,360
or you sleep and you wake up, sleep and wake up?

164
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:40,340
-No, sometimes I could not fall asleep but more often is that I fall asleep and I wake up too early,

165
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:47,590
4-5 o'clock but it can be to 2-3.

166
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:55,840
-Your feet in bed can become very hot and you have to stick them out?

167
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:59,130
-No, maybe some years ago.

168
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:11,240
-If you go for high place on 10th floor and you look down, do you have a kind of vertigo?

169
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:17,340
-Yes but not very big.

170
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:33,740
-Are you tidy now in your home or you are too lazy, you just leave things around, you are sloppy.

171
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,840
-No, but I'm not too tidy, I'm normal.

172
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:51,740
My papers can be a little mess, I'm not so strict with the papers. OK the papers for the patients

173
00:21:51,840 --> 00:22:05,490
but my own papers is not. But I have big desire to travel, if that means something.

174
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,490
-You like it very much?

175
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:35,000
-Yes, I would like to travel along for a little while. With few friends, maybe a boat,

176
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,850
here in Greece, Caribbean.

177
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:47,750
-But travelling is a big thing for you? You always wanted to travel?

178
00:22:48,250 --> 00:23:01,650
-Not always but I want to do something. I'm quite active. I don't sit down.

179
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,900
-But why you say you became lazy?

180
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:13,650
-Because it's little less restlessness. It's less.

181
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:20,900
-Restlessness is not laziness. Laziness is you don't want to do. It has nothing to do.

182
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,150
You can be very restless and very lazy.
-OK.

183
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:32,500
-It's not the same thing.
-I don't think I'm lazy.

184
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:46,590
-When you cry now, you can cry in front of others or you need to be by yourself?

185
00:23:49,080 --> 00:24:01,230
-I can cry in front of others but I try to stop it. But I'm much better now than half a year ago.

186
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:08,980
-What about the temperature of your body? You are more cold, more hot?

187
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,330
-More to the hot.

188
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:28,170
I'll be cold if somebody argues with me and then I argue with somebody, I get very cold.

189
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:34,750
-Your nails are strong?
-Yes, normal.

190
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:57,980
I somehow can feel the coolness, I could be very cold, the skin can be very cold in the evening,

191
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:09,730
I take no dress on because I feel warm. Others tell you are so cold, I didn't notice in a way.

192
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:12,480
-The body feels cold but you don't feel cold.

193
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:21,480
-Not much and I always before, I do it still but less, I had to take a cold shower

194
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:31,180
after the usual shower. In the end I had to let the water ice cold.

195
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,430
-And you enjoy this?

196
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:42,330
-Yes because if I don't do that, I feel clammy and warm, not feel refreshed

197
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:47,230
and I could go to sea water in very cold.

198
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:50,230
-You go to the sea water now?
-Yes.

199
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:58,480
-It's good?
-Yes, I can have it less hot, it's OK.

200
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,980
-How you feel in the sea?

201
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:05,580
-I love the sea, I love to be under the water.

202
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:10,830
-But you feel refreshed?
-Yes, very refreshed.

203
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:18,330
-Do you feel better in the morning, evening, night.

204
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:30,480
-If I'm by myself I'm quite tired in the evening, I'm awake in the morning if I have

205
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:38,480
a good night sleep. Usually all the years I've been an early one, early in the morning

206
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:41,170
it's good if I have a good sleep.

207
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:05,590
-So at this moment in general I feel you are quite good, why you should take another remedy?

208
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:12,840
-No? OK? Maybe I am.

209
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:21,840
-You are quite good and you don't have something bothering you at this moment.

210
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:28,260
The bloatedness is better, the coughing is better, you are not crying so much.

211
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:40,150
-The sleep is not so bad but I had to tell you I started a remedy in January and

212
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:49,900
sometimes I take a little coffee too because I was tired in the morning.

213
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,900
-Perhaps that's why you had to repeat the remedy so many time because you should not take coffee,

214
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,410
otherwise you will have to repeat the remedy too much and try not to repeat the remedy.

215
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:10,000
Try to stay away but stay away from coffee also.

216
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:21,400
-What was the problem that you came?

217
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:33,520
-The problem was the cough, the main problem is the cough but I already took Lycopodium by myself,

218
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,620
you didn't tell me.

219
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:44,350
-You had taken by the time you came here and so we said we see what Lycopodium is doing

220
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:47,700
and then we decide. Now I remember.

221
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:55,280
So you took Lycopodium up to 50M but you think it's no effect.

222
00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:06,120
-No and with the 50M the mental state was very bad. I had to take a strong cup of coffee to antidote

223
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:11,400
and I feel ameliorated.

224
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:21,020
-Tell me again the main problem. Coughing and dyspnea?

225
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:30,520
-Coughing and always bad colds. I get it all the time and I have high fever

226
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:38,350
and I feel I have high fever all the year, sneezing, sometimes watery, sometimes mucus,

227
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:45,240
abstraction all the time, hoarseness, everybody asks you had a bad cold?

228
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:53,620
-Without fever or with fever?
-Not very seldom fever, without fever.

229
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,440
-Never you have fever?

230
00:29:56,540 --> 00:30:01,290
-If I get a flu I can have some fever but very seldom.

231
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:10,440
-And you think it is hay fever or you think they are repeated colds one after another.

232
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,620
-Maybe it is hay fever.

233
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:22,620
-And the symptoms are, you wake up in the morning, just describe to me the symptoms.

234
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:28,120
-I go out of bed and then I start coughing.

235
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:37,120
-Not sneezing?
-After a while.

236
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:43,020
-But you go out of bed and you start coughing immediately? Or after 5 minutes?

237
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:57,100
-Sometimes. It's not that always, I'm a little bit better and the cough does not stay so long,

238
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:04,330
some weeks, maybe a little amelioration and then I get a bad cold, it starts

239
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:11,680
in the throat too sometimes and it goes always easily to the chest.

240
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:21,870
Before I came here it was so dry in a way, it changes a little bit, it was so dry that

241
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:31,420
I could hardly breathe during the night but when I get here I got something from a friend with herbs

242
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,250
for the chest and it helps.

243
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:47,100
So I got much mucus now and it speeded up that loosening but I got some mucus when I'm here.

244
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:04,350
-And you have taken Tuberculinum also in the past?

245
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:07,950
-Yes I have and it has done a lot for me.

246
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:15,740
-What potency?
-Up to 10M.

247
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:19,120
-Which was the remedy that helped you most?

248
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:28,770
-I think for the hay fever Tuberculinum helped me most but Lycopodium too and

249
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:37,120
sometimes Phosphorus helped me very much the spring time and I was taking this hay fever again.

250
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:59,520
And I'm very sensitive to all external, odors, painting the house, some bad smoke,

251
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:14,770
tobacco and tobacco and cold draft together is the worse. Warm drinks ameliorate

252
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:19,120
and some liqueur always.

253
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:27,270
-Like sweet alcohol.
-No, coniac.

254
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:36,020
I don't like sweet so much. Sometimes I decide for a chocolate and I can eat the whole plate

255
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,300
but it's not.

256
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:42,800
-Do you desire smoked food?

257
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:52,520
-Smoked fish it's better because I didn't eat pork and ham, bacon.

258
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,050
-Why you did not eat?

259
00:33:54,150 --> 00:34:02,350
-Because 15 years ago I had some pain in my joints and I decided to not eat pork

260
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:04,450
and it's gone away.

261
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:07,350
-The desire is not there?

262
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:13,450
-If I smell the bacon I like it very much and I like the taste but I don't eat it.

263
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:21,610
But smoked fish and salmon yes.
-Onions?

264
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:31,600
-Yes very much. And before it aggravated me, now it's better.

265
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:40,960
-Now if you eat onions you feel better after eating onions?

266
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:47,610
-I like it, I like the Greek salad with the onion.

267
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:52,050
-In general you feel cold or hot?

268
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:59,270
-In general I feel more warm but I can get cold.

269
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:12,190
If I have an argue with somebody I get very chilly, I can't get warm again and sometimes

270
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:23,850
if I have bad cold and this winter I've been little more chilly because I didn't open the window

271
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:36,030
so much at night and I take an extra blanket and during the day time I use some wool shocks.

272
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:43,530
Cough better warm drinks yes. I can't drink any cold with the cough.

273
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,320
-And then you are coughing, coughing in the morning and then what happens?

274
00:36:51,290 --> 00:37:01,440
-It changes very much. I can cough all time but I don't do it all the time. I was just before.

275
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:07,680
-When you will cough? If you run or if you lie down?

276
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:17,540
-Before it was worse to lie down in bed at night and still is but it's not so much. It can be.

277
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:36,770
Cold draft I think is the worse and some odors, perfume or tobacco smoke and the

278
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:48,270
sneezing too, there is sneezing of perfume and smells. If somebody has too much perfume

279
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:53,870
or smoke I sneeze.

280
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:35,620
-Do you have any fears you would say?
-No, very little fears.

281
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:42,270
-Are you bloated? A lot of bloatedness in your stomach?

282
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:49,020
-It's better, having a lot before because I was more constipated before

283
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:57,020
but after trying to not have milk products, I try to avoid that, it's better.

284
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:14,120
-Milk product made you bloated.
-Yes and fruits too and heavy food and sweet.

285
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,790
-And you avoid, so you are...
-I try to avoid.

286
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:51,430
Some days here in Alonissos I have bright red blood in my stool.

287
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,780
-You had blood in your stool?
-Yes.

288
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,680
-Red blood?
-Yes.

289
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:59,680
-You have hemorrhoids?
-No, never.

290
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:16,580
And a little strange because I have something in upper duodenal, some induration or some hernia

291
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:25,430
or something I noticed some weeks ago and I've taken an ultra[sound]...

292
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:37,080
not X-ray the other one where you are looking to... So they want me to take X-ray and

293
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:46,010
I do it 2 days before I come here, so I don't know the results.

294
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:10,760
But I have been very worried about my son because he has been sick for so long time.

295
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:18,160
So maybe it's something that has to do with that, I don't know. And he had the same.

296
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:20,160
-Cough?

297
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:26,330
-It was not main problem but he didn't tell me. He had the same red blood in stool

298
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:33,430
and he had it for half a year and after that I get more worried.

299
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:16,830
I'm quite depressed but I was more 1 year ago but it's still very much and I have sleeplessness,

300
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:22,880
if I wake 3-4 in the morning, the sadness is worse.

301
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:32,380
-What time is the sleeplessness?

302
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:44,990
-For half a year I sleep 3,5-4 hours during the night and it doesn't matter if I go to bed at 11

303
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:55,630
or 12 or 1 it's exactly the same hours. But for 2 months ago it's a little better.

304
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:58,980
 I can sleep 5 hours and sometimes 6.

305
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:06,130
-So your sleeplessness is exactly you go to bed, you sleep 5 hours and then you wake up

306
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:10,660
or you sleep 2 hours, you wake up, then you sleep another 2 hours?

307
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,880
-No.

308
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:20,160
-What happens? Tell me exactly.
-Exactly it's always 3,5 - 4 hours.

309
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:25,710
-That's not what I want. What time do you go to bed?

310
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:28,210
-10 or 11.

311
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:32,460
-So you sleep 3 hours, that means 2 o'clock you wake up.

312
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,710
-3 o'clock.

313
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:38,210
-After 3 can you sleep again?
-No.

314
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:43,710
-So you have sleeplessness after 3. You can not sleep anymore.

315
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:55,570
-No. But it changed a little bit the last 2 months. So I can sleep little longer sometimes.

316
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:29,960
-When you go to bed you sleep straight away or you remain, you think and think

317
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:35,460
for half an hour and then?
-Yes I do that too.

318
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:40,400
-And what do you think when you are in bed?
-Worries?

319
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:45,730
-Only worries or you think something unpleasant.

320
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:51,390
-Yes sometimes, in the morning it's never pleasant.

321
00:44:52,650 --> 00:45:00,390
-In the morning you have depression.
-I have to get up and do something.

322
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:23,100
I feel from beginning of December 1997, I feel the remedy Lycopodium didn't work anymore.

323
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:34,070
I had lots of anticipation before Christmas because I don't like to be alone and Christmas time

324
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:43,070
is the time that you are going to be with family. So I get very depressed I don't like

325
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:52,920
to be alone but if you give me the right remedy, maybe I'll be more independent.

326
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:07,400
-If you are angry you have chill?
-Yes very chilly.

327
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:11,760
-She feels cold.

328
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:19,620
-Chilly all over after I get angry with somebody, quarrels.

329
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:42,030
-Are you irritated easily?

330
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:55,680
-Before I was more irritated easily in a way yes but I have lots of suppressed anger I think

331
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:58,030
and not so good in...

332
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:02,510
-In attacking?

333
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:15,680
-To say what I want, I please too much all the others. So if I live with a man, I always want

334
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:24,680
to please and after some time I get very angry and one time I throw all the stuff in

335
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:29,600
one room on him. He think I was crazy.

336
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:34,850
-But did you hit him or you missed all?

337
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:42,700
-The soft things. And one time a cup of tea but it was not really hot.

338
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:50,200
After I feel very stupid or bad, I think.

339
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:54,700
-You were out of control.

340
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:16,550
-And I always feel very lonely in a way and that thing maybe is because I always had to be alone

341
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:17,950
when I was a child.

342
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:23,600
I had to take care by myself because my mother was always sick and I had to clean the house,

343
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:29,860
I was 6 years old and I had to do a lot of things and my father was busy, he had a shop

344
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:38,860
and he had no time for me. He was that kind of man that if I go and hug him in the evening

345
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:48,350
saying good night, he seemed embarrassed, so I stopped that and my mother tried to take off her life

346
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:54,680
since I was 14 but she didn't make it.

347
00:48:54,780 --> 00:49:00,430
I was 15 and she died from cough because she always coughed and coughed and coughed,

348
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:06,440
sitting up in the night in a chair and after all these years I didn't think she could

349
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:13,530
make it anymore, so she died and after that my father nearly died when I was 16.

350
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:19,680
He was in the hospital for 2 months, I had to take care of the shop alone, I was 16 years old,

351
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:24,030
so I had always a lot of responsibility, too much.

352
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:31,530
So I always feel I have to take care of people and stuff like that.

353
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:59,100
-You have desire to travel you said.
-Yes.

354
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,200
-You like to travel very much?
-Yes very much.

355
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:15,450
But in a way I don't travel so much as I want because I don't want to travel alone.

356
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:36,100
I used to be very hurry but I'm a little less hurry now but I'm still quite restless

357
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:42,190
and it's very sad if I sit down, I have to be occupied in a way.

358
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:54,700
If I'm alone I have to be occupied and I'm quite fast, I walk fast, I write fast.

359
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:14,590
The only fear I have is be in public, I hate that and I'm quite timid person. I don't like

360
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:16,200
to start a conversation.

361
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:24,700
If I know somebody very well it's OK, if somebody sit down and starts talking to me it's OK.

362
00:51:44,110 --> 00:51:47,010
-Do you get headaches at all?
-No.

363
00:51:47,110 --> 00:52:01,510
I can from the sun if I don't wear a hat or if I had to drink quite a lot, if I don't do that

364
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:02,610
I get headache.

365
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:13,110
And I have to take bath all the time in the sea because it's too warm in the sun.

366
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:28,360
I hate driving in a very warm car. I love the heat for the feet but not for the head.

367
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:52,510
So I have to open the window or take off the heat and it's very strange because I can sitting out

368
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:58,460
in a cold evening without clothes but sometimes I'm very cold and I haven't notice,

369
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:02,530
other people notice it. I don't notice it in a way.

370
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:06,950
-You don't notice you are getting cold.

371
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:19,440
-You don't feel it. If you eat fruits you will have a lot of gas?

372
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:20,970
-Yes.

373
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:22,970
-Bloated?
-Yes.

374
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:24,190
-Definitely?
-Yes.

375
00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:27,290
-How much do you underline this?

376
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:42,990
-3 times, especially grapes and sometimes an apple makes me sneezing and sometimes not.

377
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:54,990
I think it's the hay fever, sometimes it's another apple or something stuck on it.

378
00:53:58,490 --> 00:54:10,140
I'm allergic to cats but I have a cat, I had it for 14 years and I'm better than before

379
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:17,140
but I think he is a problem but I hate to take him.

380
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:22,720
-You don't dislike cats?
-No. I love cats very much.

381
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:27,250
-And dogs also?
-Yes, I like them.

382
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:29,900
-You are not afraid of dogs?
-No.

383
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:46,660
It's OK?

384
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:56,800
-It's never OK, we will see the action of ...
-So I don't need to add something?

385
00:54:56,900 --> 00:55:07,910
-Why do you say?
-If I should wait for you.

386
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:14,160
No, I think it's OK, that's the most of it.

387
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:30,150
With the hay fever many years ago I had pain in legs and this pain was back again.

388
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:44,150
It was a little bit strange but I think it's OK.

389
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:14,700
What's your decision in this case? Just tell me the remedy?

390
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:21,700
Tuberculinum, another one? Calcarea carbonica, another one?

391
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:26,280
Tell me some remedies.

392
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:53,030
Bryonia and China, another?
-Lachesis or Tuberculinum.

393
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:09,280
-Nux vomica.
-Pulsatilla.

394
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:19,280
-Staphysagria or Nat mur.
-Phosphorus.

395
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:30,030
-It's not clear. The case is not clear.

396
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:42,950
In such a case where the case is not clear, you will expect to have a series of remedies.

397
00:57:43,730 --> 00:57:46,480
You can't do it with one remedy.

398
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:53,300
You are expecting now to have a series of remedies with careful prescribing,

399
00:57:53,400 --> 00:58:01,770
the first prescription is careful. If it acts, then it will change whatever changes

400
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:06,860
and then you get the second remedy which is better.

401
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:14,360
Who wants to talk?

402
00:58:22,110 --> 00:58:27,770
-If a series of remedies is needed I think the group of health,

403
00:58:27,870 --> 00:58:31,610
vitality can not be very strong.

404
00:58:37,110 --> 00:58:41,310
-In this case I tell you what has happened. The group is not very low.

405
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:49,840
It's the second group here but the problem is too many remedies have confused the case.

406
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:58,810
Therefore we have to deconfuse the case, you are expecting the same condition with Picric acid,

407
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:05,660
we start with Picric acid, then Ignatia, then etc. It is the 4th remedy.

408
00:59:06,830 --> 00:59:19,980
Once you have taken a series of remedies which have not solved the problem, then there is confusion.

409
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:26,980
The side effects of homeopathic remedies is to modify the symptoms.

410
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:34,640
It's not the side effect can cause some kind of damage but they modify the symptoms

411
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:37,660
and nobody can find the right remedy.

412
00:59:38,410 --> 00:59:43,110
This is the side effects of wrong prescription.

413
00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:52,830
So in this case you see it is difficult and therefore we rely heavily on repertorization.

414
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:03,580
Here are 17 symptoms, how many symptoms you put?

415
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:08,330
17 OK.

416
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:22,810
Show me flat repertorization. Nux vomica, Arsenicum, China, Sepia, Bryonia, Aconitum

417
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:27,900
Pulsatilla, Alumina, Sulphur, Calcarea, Phosphorus.

418
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:34,400
All these remedies and then the Expert System says what?

419
01:00:51,230 --> 01:01:03,230
Explain why. China has the dry cough, it has it on 3rd degree, you see? Strong.

420
01:01:04,930 --> 01:01:16,900
The dry cough after rising it has it on 2d degree. Sensitive to odors, tobacco.

421
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:45,570
China is not sensitive to odors. Cough from draft of air, abdomen flatulence from fruit.

422
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:58,320
She is the only one, blood in stool, sleeplessness midnight after 3 a.m. and timidity.

423
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:04,820
These are the symptoms where Nux vomica covers more symptoms definitely.

424
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:22,070
No, Nux vomica does not cover more symptoms. How many symptoms were with China?

425
01:02:22,570 --> 01:02:24,890
-9 also.

426
01:02:29,390 --> 01:02:43,890
-Bryonia is... Where is amelioration with warm?
-Nux vomica has it. Amelioration warm fluids.

427
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:51,260
-In a hurry. She is in a hurry? Very much.

428
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:19,560
Bryonia dry cough, warm fluids ameliorate, sleeplessness night after 3, chill after anger.

429
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:28,560
This is important for Bryonia but what is against Bryonia in her case?

430
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:36,290
She needs company. Bryonia does not need company.

431
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:39,640
She will not stress that point usually, maybe.

432
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:51,060
Did you put all this? Put it desires company, underline it twice.

433
01:03:52,720 --> 01:04:00,470
No change, Nux vomica, Aconitum, Ignatia, Bryonia, Arsenicum...

434
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:12,210
So my first prescription will be China to see if it will move the case and in case not

435
01:04:12,310 --> 01:04:17,310
then the second remedy will be Tuberculinum, again Tuberculinum higher potency.

436
01:04:19,810 --> 01:04:21,810
-What about Pulsatilla?
-Pulsatilla no.

437
01:04:24,770 --> 01:04:29,020
-Carcinosin?
-No, I don't see.
