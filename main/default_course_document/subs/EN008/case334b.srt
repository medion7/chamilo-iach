1
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:26,150
-The baby is due in 5 weeks. At the moment I have some problems.

2
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:32,540
I have very strong edemas in the legs.

3
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,610
This morning I still was wearing stockings for compression but now I have to remove them

4
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:40,210
because of the heat.

5
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:48,960
In the mornings I also have edemas of the hands and feeling numbness, especially in my thumbs.

6
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,960
It's not painful but it's very uncomfortable feeling.

7
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:07,540
My blood pressure was rising since June. The last value was 150 over 80.

8
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,690
And in the last urine examination, I had protein in my urine.

9
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,780
-How much?

10
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:24,160
-It's 2 axes but I don't know, I can't tell you how much exactly it was.

11
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:32,320
The medical assistance in this gynecologist office, where I go, told me that having up to 15

12
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:41,160
leucocytes per site field in the urine was normal and in the last urine check, I had 17 leucocytes.

13
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:50,060
The reason why I'm emphasing this is that I'm a bit worried since in May 1998 I had a severe

14
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:56,160
pyelonephritis with septicemia which was very bad.

15
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,060
One other thing which I personally don't think is that important is that my hemoglobin rate

16
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,660
is going down month by month and in the last check, it was 9.9.

17
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:24,810
-How she feels psychologically?
-I confronted a lot of difficulties.

18
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:31,410
I tried to find a way to deal with the situation and I also have tried to look for help.

19
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:39,330
The first place in the end where I have to go is to go and seek social security

20
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:42,910
and having to do this, for me was really terrible.

21
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:49,060
For me the feeling really was as if they had taken away my dignity because once I get money

22
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,810
from them, they have certain requirements, I have to obey.

23
00:02:53,910 --> 00:03:01,560
I'm not allowed to have a car anymore, I must live in an apartment that has so and so square meters.

24
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:05,810
They told me that I have to close my practice, my office.

25
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,660
I'm not allowed to continue practicing Homeopathy and so on.

26
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:16,010
For me this is really terrible but there is actually no other way around it because my debts

27
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:21,580
have grown so high that the bank just refuses to give me any more money.

28
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,990
-Her boyfriend is not in contact with her?

29
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:31,330
-No, he hasn't contact me anymore since 2nd May  of this year.

30
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:40,310
And what made the whole thing so difficult for me is that I felt into depression which

31
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,900
was so severe that it paralyzed me.

32
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,150
-Is she crying easily?
-In the last weeks yes.

33
00:03:52,910 --> 00:04:02,840
When I'm excited and somebody really turns to me and listens yes; otherwise not.

34
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:10,190
When somebody is really paying attention to me and really going into my situation.

35
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:17,090
This feeling I had during the depression, being paralyzed, the feeling of not being able

36
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:25,260
to do anything anymore, that's not new but it was never so strong as it is now.

37
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:35,010
What I realized over the last time is that being alone really tortures me.

38
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:44,510
It's really painful for me and it's breaking me. And I also had to realize that people

39
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:49,790
on whom I actually counted that something would becoming from them, for example the parents

40
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:54,340
of the child's father, who in the beginning encouraged me, come on, have the child,

41
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:59,100
we'll help you, we'll be there, now when I really need it, there is nothing.

42
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,090
Neither financially, nor emotionally, just nothing.

43
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,850
-The parents of the father?

44
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:15,090
-And right now there is just chaos in my life because I have no urge, no motivation

45
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:21,840
what soever to get my strength together and to get things done. I just let things pass by

46
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:29,840
I postpone things, there is no energy whatsoever and of course surely this leads to consequences

47
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,200
and to difficulties.

48
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:41,840
-Does she cook for herself?
-Every once in a while.

49
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:47,090
-She cleans the house?
-Sometimes but it could be done more often.

50
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:59,740
-And my problem with my kind of orderliness is such that I can part for many things.

51
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:06,740
I keep small memorabilia even small piece of paper because reminds me of some

52
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,990
wonderful situation that I would hate to forget and because of this I have lots of crap

53
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,090
at home that actually isn't necessary.

54
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,760
-How is her thirst?
-Almost unchanged.

55
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,460
I need 2 lit the day water.

56
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:35,920
-For cold?
-I prefer cold. It's more agreeable.

57
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:46,860
-How is her reaction to weather? She needs fresh air?

58
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:54,420
-I can not tolerate heat at all and I'm really happy if it gets cooler because I feel better then.

59
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,570
-She eats fruits now?

60
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:06,130
-I don't like fruits at all, every once in a while I eat some but I have to force myself to do it.

61
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:18,060
-Does she know if she still grinds her teeth?
-I have no idea because I sleep alone.

62
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:34,700
-Is she tolerating is somebody wants to say good words for her? She likes it?

63
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:42,450
-Yes, I like it very much but on the other hand it creates such an upheaval in me that

64
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,080
I can start to cry.

65
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,880
-She is still sighing?
-Yes.

66
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,530
I always have the feeling that I'm going to other people's nerves with my sighing

67
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:58,630
it must be really annoying if somebody is sighing all the time.

68
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:09,530
-She drinks milk?
-A little bit in my tea but otherwise not.

69
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,130
-She still smokes?
-Unfortunately.

70
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:19,890
The desire for cigarettes has been extremely strong in between.

71
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,140
Now it is the way it has been before.

72
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:34,300
-Out of this period, since we saw her, which is the worst?

73
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:46,810
From May until now which is the worst? Is September, August, July?

74
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,810
She said last few weeks was much worse.

75
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:58,550
-I would say the last 4 weeks things have been worse but it also has been bad before

76
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:03,400
these 4 weeks already. But the last 4 weeks, things got even worse.

77
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:09,650
-How much salt she wants?
-I take quite a lot of salt.

78
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,400
I like it a lot, I don't need it but I like it a lot.

79
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:26,050
I want to say something which I noticed frequently.

80
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:32,050
I very frequently swallow the wrong way, for example when I'm drinking I swallow and

81
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:35,650
it goes down the wrong tube and I have to cough a lot.

82
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:45,800
If you would like to know, I could report about the physical reactions I had after taking Belladonna.

83
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,140
-Yes.

84
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:56,300
-I developed tiny little warts in different areas of my body and underneath my arm and other places,

85
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:03,300
then I begun perspiring on my feet again which had not been the case for the last 3-4 years.

86
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:17,240
-She had complained if she remembers, the main complain was tension in here and in

87
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:25,460
the back of the neck and cramping, that was the main complain, how is that?

88
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,230
-That had remained unchanged.

89
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:35,120
-Why is she not mentioning it? She mentions some other symptoms but not the main symptom

90
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,620
which she complained the first time.

91
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,200
-I would report it, I also have written it down, it's just so many things.

92
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:50,710
I've noticed two things about this tension. It aggravates either when I feel insecure

93
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:57,800
or when I do mental exertion. That's the other time when it increases.

94
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:08,950
-What was the blood pressure when we first examined her.

95
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:15,430
-It was 120 over 70 for a long period of time, also 110 over 60.

96
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,430
-Before pregnancy?
-Yes and during pregnancy.

97
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:30,330
I sometimes have some burning in my stomach but I think that's normal in pregnancy.

98
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:45,080
-And physical exertion, I can not take much at all, in the slightest exertion I get

99
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,770
heartbeat very easily, palpitations.

100
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:55,550
I wake up every two hours now and have difficulties falling asleep again.

101
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,630
I have salivation from my mouth at night, I used to have it in former years and this

102
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,310
has come back now.

103
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,440
I had a feeling on numbness in the entire left arm accompanied them

104
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:27,290
and also coordination problem, I had problems forming words, speaking.

105
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:33,820
-She had two episodes like this?
-1 or 2 I can't remember exactly.

106
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,790
-Anything else?

107
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:46,960
-My lymph nodes are swollen in the throat and I often had that in former times also.

108
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,460
Physically that's all.

109
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:57,570
-In the first interview she had complained of headache in the morning, in waking.

110
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:10,920
-Not anymore. After sleeping I'm often more tired than before. Sleep is not refreshing.

111
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,130
-In the morning or afternoon?

112
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,970
-In the morning I need a long period after I'm really clear.

113
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:22,970
And this also happens in the afternoon, if I sleep in the afternoon.

114
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:30,950
Right now I have the feeling that I'm too open, everything can enter me directly and I feel

115
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:44,970
as if I have a lack of immune system on my mental, emotional area.

116
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:54,120
It's already a couple of months back that I saw a movie of a young environmentalist

117
00:13:54,220 --> 00:14:03,870
in the Unites States who are fighting for these huge trees that are cut.

118
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:11,370
So the police started going against them and they smeared a kind of poison stuff into their eyes,

119
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:17,620
some chemical and it's something that shakes me up to today, just the imagination that things

120
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:26,720
like that are possible and anything cruel I see I can not shield myself of, it really goes right into me.

121
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:38,120
One last thing I would really like to mention because it's really important to me and

122
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:45,310
then I think I will stop, even though I have some more points in my list, is that I'm absolutely naive.

123
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:53,370
Whoever comes towards me I always suspect that he has best intention, best motivation

124
00:14:53,470 --> 00:15:01,470
and here in this course I don't get disappointed often but I would say in the "real world" it happens

125
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:05,870
to me quite often. So I'm really deep down naive.

126
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:10,950
-She believes that somebody has something...

127
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:16,950
-Yes I easily believe and I always assume that these people are honest with me and

128
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:23,700
have good intentions and please don't give them a homework that they have to work on my case

129
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:27,050
now during the break because they gonna kill me when I come out.

130
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:38,380
-She was reading my mind actually.
-Maybe.

131
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:46,720
-OK we go inside to the class.

132
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,980
Let's see the rubrics that we can use in this case.

133
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:41,120
17 symptoms food and drinks, aversion milk, sighing underlines 3 times, aversion fruits twice,

134
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:54,880
cold drinks desire, collects many things, sentimental, desire salt, warts upper limbs

135
00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:02,790
perspiration on foot, cervical region, pregnancy during, palpitation of heart,

136
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:11,140
salivation sympathetic.

137
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:16,970
Do you agree with this or you want to add something or take away?

138
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:22,390
-Take away.
-What you want to take away?

139
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:30,360
-George I miss swalling the wrong way and I think point 7, consolation ameliorates,

140
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,750
I think is a problem.

141
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:46,360
-Swallowing the wrong way, put this. We can not find it in the Repertory.

142
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:52,180
-And also the point consolation ameliorates, I think she said I like consolation but it's average,

143
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,180
I'm very deeply touched.

144
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:58,280
-Not aggravate, she is deeply touched.

145
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:06,950
In the previous interview she said, she did not like consolation.

146
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:11,930
In the previous interview it was underlined 3 times that she did not like consolation.

147
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:20,430
This time she did not say that I do nor perceive that but don't stuck in these little things

148
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,780
because we have big things here.

149
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,280
What are the big things?

150
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:34,530
You like this symptomatology?

151
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:46,530
Too many symptoms. So which symptoms you want out? Which symptoms you take out?

152
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:52,780
Swelling of feet.

153
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,810
-Complain during pregnancy.

154
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:06,030
-You want it out?
-Yes.

155
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,680
-But the complains are during pregnancy really.

156
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,530
All, what she has is because of pregnancy.

157
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:29,680
In this case because we don't have much time, we have to differentiate

158
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,780
between the following remedies.

159
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:42,530
Phosphorus, Ignatia, Pulsatilla, Nat. mur.

160
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:50,430
There are symptoms for these 4 remedies.

161
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:57,180
Out of the 4 remedies, which is the one that you will prescribe.

162
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:27,530
I would like to hear who will prescribe Phosphorus? 5 Ignatia? 28. Pulsatilla? 19. Nat. mur. 19.

163
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:49,530
So Ignatia is the preference of the class. You took Ignatia.

164
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:58,780
But after Belladonna did she take Ignatia?
-No.

165
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:02,040
-You took no other remedy.
-No.

166
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:11,360
-What is my problem with Ignatia? I'll tell you.

167
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:25,120
Because she has some sighing and aversion fruits, two strong keynotes both absolutely there.

168
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:38,360
My problem is first that Ignatia will not be presenting her case like she did.

169
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:49,760
She is too expressive, too open and too crying and in front of the camera.

170
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:57,110
I asked her whether she is crying, yes, in front of the camera also she can not hold back.

171
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:04,610
That is one thing that does not give me the impression of Homeopathy.

172
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:25,530
Another problem is that she is too warm for Ignatia.

173
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:45,800
Another problem is, last time if you remember, she was much more painful

174
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,300
and do you like consolation?

175
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:56,810
No, it was underlined 3 times. Now there was a change in that psychology,

176
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:59,160
she would like consolation

177
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:09,800
but she is in a vulnerable state and this consolation, this showing sympathy rises

178
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,400
too much emotions.

179
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:18,900
That does not go with Nat. mur. or Ignatia, it goes with Pulsatilla.

180
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:38,400
Now the first complain she says is I'm swelled up, I kept water.

181
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:51,480
Which is the remedy, out of these 4, that will do that in pregnancy?

182
00:23:54,740 --> 00:24:00,880
Pulsatilla. The remedy will be Pulsatilla for her pathology.

183
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:19,480
Which is the remedy that she would say, I feel better in fresh air? Pulsatilla.

184
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:29,980
So therefore what is the Expert System saying?

185
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:54,630
The Expert System says by far Pulsatilla is the prescription because you see you took away

186
00:24:54,730 --> 00:25:19,720
ailments from pregnancy? You put complains during pregnancy?

187
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:42,890
Phosphorus because there is thirst for cold water. Who likes cold water?

188
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:54,240
Pulsatilla likes cold things, cold water but is not thirsty. Phosphorus is thirsty.

189
00:25:55,990 --> 00:26:04,740
Is Phosphorus sympathetic? Very sympathetic yes. She is sympathetic.

190
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:19,900
If you want to prescribe on pathology, you can prescribe Apis but we try now to prescribe more

191
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,890
on the totality of the symptoms.

192
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:27,240
Do we have a totality? Well, we have.

193
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:44,890
The numbness in the morning is not a rubric that you can base a prescription.

194
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:55,970
For the same reasons that we excluded Ignatia, we must exclude Nat. mur. because

195
00:26:56,070 --> 00:27:06,450
she is not the type at this moment, she is not the type which is close. She would not have cried

196
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:21,800
so much and we have complains from heat, which creates a kind of varicose veins situation.

197
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:30,220
Which is the remedy which in the heat the legs are swollen and we have varicose veins?

198
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:38,720
The remedy is Pulsatilla.

199
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:51,630
Concerning Apis what you would expect more?
-Thirst less.

200
00:27:52,130 --> 00:28:00,450
-Thirst less is one but also the swelling will be appearing primarily under the eyes.

201
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:15,800
Not only that but do you understand her psychological state at the moment?

202
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:20,800
What she does? She does nothing, she just smokes.

203
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:29,460
She sits around and says, I have no initiative, I don't do anything, I sit around, I can

204
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:35,200
imagine her sitting around, looking for hours, doing nothing.

205
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:40,550
Is this correct?
-No.

206
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:57,650
If it's not so that I'm doing nothing but if I do something it's not what I should be doing

207
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:01,370
but what I want to do right now.

208
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:10,550
-But if we come to the last remark which is important for her which says what?

209
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:19,300
I am naive, I believe everybody who comes along and tells me things.

210
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:29,300
This is something you will not hear from Ignatia, Nat. mur. or Apis.

211
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:37,550
You may here it with Phosphorus but in a different manner or with Pulsatilla.

212
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:48,620
Pulsatilla is the remedy that says, I believe everything. Easily persuaded,

213
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,360
you tell her something, she will believe, she will follow etc.

214
00:29:52,460 --> 00:30:08,780
This is what she said but for me what is the most dramatic change is from aversion consolation,

215
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,950
now she says, I would like to have consolation.

216
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:20,050
The only thing is that it touches me so much that brings out a lot of emotion and I start crying.

217
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:28,200
-I hate that it might a translation problem. In German there is another word, which is a bit

218
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,450
different from consolation.

219
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:39,550
What I mean is compassion. I never, in general, had an aversion to consolation.

220
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:44,550
Perhaps it has been a misunderstanding in translation.

221
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:57,700
-OK, ask her if there is any time where she feels worse. What is this time?

222
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:04,950
-In the morning, when I wake up because of unrefreshed sleep.

223
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:17,050
-Psychologically when she feels worse?
-I don't know.

224
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:28,700
If I may add something, I've noticed that I have a craving or I like creamy things.

225
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:32,450
Yogurt with honey or sweets.

226
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:44,950
-Yogurt is creamy? What about fat? Fat in meat.

227
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:49,730
-I haven't' been eating meat in the past years because I don't like it much and also

228
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:56,330
because of ethical reasons, because I feel sorry for the animals.

229
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:04,280
I saw a movie in which animals that had been transported in trucks around Europe

230
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:11,710
to be slaughtered, how they are treated and since then I only eat meat every 2-3 weeks.

231
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:24,710
I can not eat food that is swimming in olive oil but on the other hand butter I like a lot.

232
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:35,960
-Butter you like a lot? Add butter.

233
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:54,760
Now we'll ask another question in which she will say yes. Taken Pulsatilla before, when?

234
00:32:54,860 --> 00:33:01,010
-I took Pulsatilla once at the end of 1995, I was the speaker of the class, that was at the end of

235
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:10,260
our practitioner School and I had to cry so much of each mate that was leaving at the end

236
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,360
of the School.

237
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:24,280
-And she took Pulsatilla during that time?
-One dose C200.

238
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:32,700
-And what was the effect of Pulsatilla C200? Did she feel any effect?

239
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,610
-I didn't have to cry anymore.

240
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:37,100
-That's all.

241
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:48,700
-On that day I didn't cry anymore and I felt better. I felt lighter but I used to be addicted to  coffee.

242
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:54,700
-You still drink coffee now?
-No.

243
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:06,200
-Well, therefore Pulsatilla 200 is the prescription.
