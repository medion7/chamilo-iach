1
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,810
This case, she comes to the doctor and says...

2
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:35,310
The first thing she says is that mostly what I suffer from

3
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,420
is that I have the tendency to commit suicide.

4
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:50,050
What is this remedy?
-Aurum.

5
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,900
-Aurum, very good. But it's not.

6
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:02,830
Why it's wrong?
-It's too open.

7
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,670
-It's too open for an Aurum.

8
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:11,570
Aurum won't come and tell you from the very beginning you know my problem is

9
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,230
I want to commit suicide. Forget it, that's not Aurum.

10
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:21,150
It's a more open remedy, it's a more vital remedy that will say that.

11
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:26,500
Pulsatilla can say it, Sulphur can say it but not Aurum.

12
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:37,900
Because the type that we meet Aurum, it will one with sheer depression.

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,900
Aurum has decided to commit suicide. He may be come for his depression

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,520
but with the back of his mind he says I want to commit suicide.

15
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:55,760
This is not a symptom. It is a logical decision because he suffers so much.

16
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:05,100
He suffers so much, the depression is so...that he does not want to live anymore.

17
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,930
This is the state of Aurum.

18
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:13,690
Therefore he will not come and tell you my problem is that I want to commit suicide.

19
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:23,290
Immediately your mind should go to other remedies which are more open and vital.

20
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:32,940
A Natrum sulphuricum would it say so?
-No.

21
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:41,450
-Which are the remedies in the Repertory? Open the Repertory at suicidal disposition.

22
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:55,100
We have in capitals, Aurum, Aurum muriaticum and Natrum sulphuricum.

23
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:06,750
These are the three remedies. The two Aurums are similar in their way of facing the world.

24
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:13,180
The one is Aurum metallicum and the other is Aurum muriaticum, the underneath.

25
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:19,430
The Aurum muriaticum is not as deep as Aurum metallicum.

26
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,830
It is quite deep but not as deep as Aurum metallicum.

27
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:28,830
Aurum metallicum should be underlined in the Repertory

28
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,570
because it's the remedy that really commits suicide.

29
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:37,420
It's the number one remedy that really commits suicide.

30
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:48,830
It has to be elevated further from the other two.

31
00:03:48,930 --> 00:04:01,070
Aurum muriaticum, the muriatica seems that pose down the tendency of Aurum to stop his life

32
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:09,670
and they will say this, I cannot live anymore etc.

33
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,260
Depression we see with Aurum metallicum.

34
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:22,260
Natrum sulphuricum now. We have what kind of depression?

35
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:32,580
There is a struggle inside in Natrum sulphuricum cases that it's really a struggle

36
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:42,580
that I should not live anymore, I want to die, I just want to go away from this world.

37
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:47,580
But they know that if they do it, their children, their brothers,

38
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,820
their sisters will suffer tremendously.

39
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:57,820
They know that and they want to bring that suffering to their relatives.

40
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:07,980
There is a constant struggle inside them. On the one hand wanted to go away from this world,

41
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:19,590
on the other hand they say if they do it, think of ... I don't know the Indian name...

42
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:46,500
I struggle inside, I must die, I can't live, a constant struggle inside.

43
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:53,490
This is the feeling inside. I want you to understand the real inside, what is going on.

44
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:59,250
Then do you think they will come and tell you I'm struggling inside? No.

45
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:04,500
Then what you get? You get a feeling, yes I want to die.

46
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:13,830
And then you feel something more is inside and you say why don't you die?

47
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,740
They say I'm thinking of my children, I'm thinking of my brothers,

48
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,910
I'm thinking of whomever he is connected. And then what?

49
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:38,160
Then I constantly have that struggle to pick up the information, almost force the information.

50
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:45,400
They are not open people who just tell that I want to commit suicide.

51
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,040
So neither Aurum Muriaticum, nor Natrum sulphuricum

52
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:55,400
or Aurum metallicum will use such an expression.

53
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:04,310
When I was in primary school I was first but when I went to the gymnasium

54
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:09,550
because they were better people than me, I thought of giving up gymnasium.

55
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:15,320
Also I have claustrophobia, intense fear, especially when I'm going through a tunnel.

56
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:20,160
The thought that the train may stop going through a tunnel cause great panic to me.

57
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:28,220
When I was in the primary school I was first but when I went to the gymnasium

58
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,970
because they were better people than me I thought of giving up gymnasium.

59
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,960
Who can say that? Which are the persons?

60
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,560
Can an Aurum say that?
-Yes.

61
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:46,300
-Yes, an Aurum can confess that. But it's not only Aurum.

62
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,640
It might be a remedy which has mental weakness as well.

63
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,910
Which are the remedies that have mental weakness?

64
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:25,310
Argentum nitricum, Phosphorus, Phosphoric acid, Picric acid, Anacardium, Aethusa,

65
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:34,400
Barytta carbonica, Agaricus... and many others.

66
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:40,550
Now I also have claustrophobia and intense fear, especially when I'm going through a tunnel.

67
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:50,730
Which are the remedies that have claustrophobia going through a tunnel, great panic?

68
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,000
How do you find claustrophobia in the Repertory?

69
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,300
-Fear of narrow places.

70
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:09,910
-Fear of narrow places. Find fear of narrow places in the Repertory.

71
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:20,190
Other remedies that have that are Lycopodium, Natrum muriaticum, Calcarea carbonica.

72
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,850
Sometimes she wants to press the heart region and at the same time to take a deep breath

73
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:37,080
because she feels a kind of discomfort there and she is afraid that the heart will burst out.

74
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,940
How do you find this symptom in the Repertory?

75
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:50,190
Has anybody found this symptom? No.

76
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,930
Feeling of bursting in the heart.

77
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:19,330
Suddenly as I'm working I have a sudden tendency to faint.

78
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,190
Where do you find this symptom?

79
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,190
I have a great, sudden weakness.

80
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:44,430
Sudden weakness where do you see? In the generalities, weakness sudden.

81
00:10:55,190 --> 00:11:00,940
This is how you look in the Repertory, how you study a case.

82
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:10,690
You try to see what is the remedy which covers mostly the symptomatology of the patient.

83
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:16,990
You go and look and search in the Repertory and you will always find eitherthe exact symptom

84
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:22,500
or something similar. And then you get some ideas about it.

85
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:33,330
Then the final decision will be made by your knowledge of Materia Medica.

86
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,030
How much knowledge of Materia Medica do you have?

87
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,770
Eventually you will say is this a case of Phosphorus? Is this a case of Sepia?

88
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:44,990
Is this a case of Aconite? Is this a case of Argentum nitricum?

89
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:07,740
Then after you study a case in this way, you have a lot of remedies.

90
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:14,580
You come down with 5 or 6 remedies that they may be possible in such a case.

91
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:22,490
In this particular case, you may be coming with different remedies

92
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:45,860
like Aconite, Argentum nitricum, Phosphorus, Arsenicum, Sepia.

93
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:08,990
And then you have to decide which of these remedies that came through repertorization

94
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,520
is the right one.

95
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:20,260
Let us say that the remedy is within those remedies which is indicated here...

96
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:28,250
Which of these remedies fits mostly this particular case? This is the question.

97
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,410
Out of repertorization we came down...

98
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:39,910
You saw frequently Aconite, Argentum nitricum, Phosphorus, Arsenicum and Sepia.

99
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:46,910
Which of these remedies is mostly fitting to this case

100
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:52,250
and how logically you can say this is the remedy?

101
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,910
Here now comes the knowledge of Materia Medica.

102
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:19,180
How much Materia Medica do you know to be able to differentiate really?

103
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:24,170
If you don't know enough Materia Medica, what you will do?

104
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:56,580
Can anybody tell me what you will do?
-Totality.

105
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,850
-But you worked on the totality and more remedies come through.

106
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:10,420
What are you going to do?
-Find the essence.

107
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:16,410
-Say you don't know the essence of all these remedies to be able to differentiate.

108
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,840
What can you do further?

109
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:49,930
You may try to see the causative factor, it is giving you a clue.

110
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:53,420
What was the causative factor in this case?

111
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:07,910
-There was an earthquake.

112
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:11,170
-There was an earthquake and people were dying.

113
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:25,160
You don't know the remedy. I know the remedy but I try to teach you how to think.

114
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:35,810
This state came after a fright that this man had because of the earthquake

115
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:40,660
and because also of some death that took place next to that.

116
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:08,740
Then what is next? What I'm going to do next?

117
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:17,910
Which are the remedies that they may have symptoms after fright?

118
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,890
Here in Greece that we have a lot of earthquakes, I give you a remedy

119
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:43,900
that has symptomatology after this fright.
-Opium.

120
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:53,990
-Opium, Aconite, Stramonium, Ignatia concerning...

121
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:10,390
and this person has 2-3 symptoms that are very underlined.

122
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,490
What are the symptoms that are 3 times underlined?

123
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:32,030
Great, sudden weakness, I don't want anybody to contradict me, time seems endless if I wait,

124
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:42,750
I cannot hear bad news, I become panicky, claustrophobia, fear of being in a crowd,

125
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:47,190
she cannot go out, then she becomes panicky.

126
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:56,440
There is a day where she cannot go out and then she becomes claustrophobic.

127
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,590
I cannot even think of going in an airplane and fear of being alone in the house

128
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,680
in case there is an earthquake.

129
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:15,270
These are the symptoms that have been intensively underlined.

130
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:31,610
From the Materia Medica we know that after fright from this remedy, Aconite should be one

131
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,860
that is mostly indicated.

132
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:42,220
From this remedy, the one that is mostly indicated after fright is Aconite.

133
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:55,710
Which is the remedy which has fear in a crowd and claustrophobia?

134
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:04,710
Fear of narrow places, we read it before, it was Aconite.

135
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:10,860
See fear in a crowd, see in your Repertory.

136
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,790
You see how strongly is Aconite there?

137
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:31,740
If you go and read now the Materia Medica, especially our Materia Medica on Aconite,

138
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,490
you will see the description of that very much,

139
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:43,720
you will see how the Aconite cannot go in an airplane, how he becomes panicky

140
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,570
and then they faint.

141
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:54,380
You will see all the description of what is happening here and also you will not be mislead

142
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:08,380
to prescribe here Aurum because the Aconite patient is an open patient, vital, strong,

143
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,480
will give this information immediately, I want to commit suicide.

144
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:19,150
It is not a closed person, it is an extrovert.

145
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:36,810
Out of these remedies if you go and study a little bit more,

146
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:41,390
you will see that Aconite is very prominently indicated.

147
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:09,240
Would you like to see what she said when she came? She got Aconite 50M.

148
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:18,130
When she came back after a month, she said that generally and mentally she is much better.

149
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:22,380
From the beginning when the doctor started enquiring about her symtpoms,

150
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:28,380
she says it crossed out all the bad symptomatology which I had.

151
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,480
I have nothing anymore from that.

152
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:43,630
I had an aggravation the seventh day. The seventh day she had a mental aggravation

153
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:49,630
and since that day, since the seventh day, that she was very irritable,

154
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:57,140
she wanted to kill her husband, after the seventh day everything is going well.

155
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:01,290
No tendency to commit suicide, no fear in the tunnel.

156
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:06,640
She has come actually by train, the day she came to consultation.

157
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:17,730
The chest symptoms are not there, no fainting, no weakness.

158
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:27,130
Buzzing in the ears if I'm pressed by some situation but even this is better.

159
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:31,480
She had not given in the beginning this symptom.

160
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:36,470
The feeling that something kicks the heart is better.

161
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:44,480
She wants to do the work in the house. No fear of brain stroke.

162
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:54,630
She managed to go and shop in the town, the claustrophobia is much better.

163
00:23:54,730 --> 00:24:00,610
She can wait now, she goes on like that.

164
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:08,110
We see in the report because of that general amelioration

165
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:14,860
that the remedy has really acted deeply, in spite of being Aconite.

166
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:21,040
Aconite usually in our books, we have it for common colds.

167
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,630
When there is a common cold, we give Aconite.

168
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:30,030
And you see here a case which is quite disturbed mentally

169
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:34,550
and Aconite takes all the symptomatology

170
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:38,880
and gives us a beautiful cure on a chronic condition.
