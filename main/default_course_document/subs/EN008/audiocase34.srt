1
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,650
I would like to give you another case.

2
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:47,980
There is a case of recurrent herpes on the left hand.

3
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:57,450
It's a woman 31 years old.

4
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,710
She was married on 1980, she is happy with the marriage.

5
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:19,380
The date is 14th of April 1982.

6
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,130
She has great irritability, underlined 3 times.

7
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:39,460
If I let this irritability out, then I become calm. It's going away.

8
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:48,460
I'm very inside...

9
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:58,110
I don't take things easily. Everything I don't say never mind.

10
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:04,130
The word never mind does not occurs to me, this type of person.

11
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:16,770
If I have some kind of quarrel in my work, then that problem comes in my mind

12
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,630
and then it stays there all the time that I'm at home.

13
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:25,130
I can forgive but I do not forget.

14
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:42,380
She can forgive but cannot forget, underlined 2-3 times.

15
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,970
Fear of death, underlined 3 times.

16
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:57,520
She has metaphysical agonies, the night especially when she goes to bed.

17
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,380
Metaphysical questions.

18
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,670
Easily offended, underlined 3 times.

19
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,420
Jealous, underlined twice.

20
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:38,420
Wakes up unrefreshed, sleeps in all positions.

21
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,670
Worse in spring time, more irritability.

22
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:55,150
Sometimes I have the tendency to go away but I don't know what whould please me.

23
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:06,730
I like the sea but I'm afraid that I may drown myself.

24
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:18,240
Does not like tight clothes in the body, underlined twice.

25
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:25,060
Desires fish, fruits, underlined once.

26
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:33,820
Sweets normal, thirst normal, sex normal.

27
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:45,820
No reactions to temperature, neither she feels cold nor hot.

28
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:56,570
She has a duodenal ulcer also but at the moment she came she had no symptomatology.

29
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:15,970
That woman had come about 3 years ago and had taken the same remedy she received now

30
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,890
and she did well for 3 years, she took antibiotics.

31
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:25,240
But now the doctor takes a new case, it's as if it is new.

32
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:32,730
Anybody wants to do the analysis of the case?

33
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:50,970
-She has underlined 3 times the fear of death and with that there are several other keynotes.

34
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:55,570
Worse spring, dislikes tight clothing and great irretability.

35
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:08,070
When she discharges the emotions, she feels better ...

36
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:17,980
The metaphysical questions is again Lachesis, the can forgive

37
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,820
but can't forget... of Lachesis.

38
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:32,970
-Who agrees with that analysis?
-With some.

39
00:06:33,070 --> 00:07:10,480
-Anybody else? Any other suggestion?
-The great irritability...and the fear of death...

40
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:33,730
-Nitric acid. Who agrees with that? Another?
-Nux vomica.

41
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:55,500
-Very good. Very well justified, especially the Lachesis is very well justified.

42
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:08,400
Ailments like reaction to temperature that's OK.

43
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:14,890
Now what I want to show you is...

44
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:20,740
Sometimes we prescribe on essence.

45
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:29,400
That's a case we rely mostly on essence because you see if you take it this way,

46
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,900
it comes out that, if you take it the other way, comes out another remedy.

47
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,740
Nux vomica is quite well justified also.

48
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:48,250
So here we are not sure about the essence.

49
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:53,780
If we are going to prescribe on essence here, we shall not be happy so far.

50
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,540
I would not be happy that this is the remedy or that is the remedy.

51
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:10,440
I'm not happy with Lachesis, I'm not happy with Nux vomica, I'm not happy with Nitric acid.

52
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:14,030
I'll give you one more information...

53
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:37,440
You will see what I mean the essence. Now everybody will say yes...

54
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,190
You see how you change your choice?

55
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:47,520
By completing the information how the choice changes

56
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:52,450
and everybody is sure that this the remedy?

57
00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:06,540
She is very anxious about her husband, what is going to happen to him.

58
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,770
Nobody knows that? Don't open the Repertories.

59
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,370
Who knows that rubric?

60
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:38,350
You open the Repertory. Anxiety about her husband.

61
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:41,030
That's what she says, what is going to happen to him?

62
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:48,880
She is afraid about his situation. Health, security, that's general.

63
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:57,280
Has anybody found the rubric? Which page?

64
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:02,460
Page 7 on the right side.

65
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:14,990
Did anybody find page 7, column b, in the middle of that column.

66
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,950
-Anxiety for others?
-No, for husband.

67
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:28,130
-It's under fear.

68
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:43,610
I thought that you knew that but you thought anxiety about others.

69
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:55,350
Did you see now? What page is it?
-45.

70
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:01,100
-Second column in the middle.

71
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:12,350
Now what are you going to prescribe? I may be misleading you.

72
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:30,100
We go further. Look a little bit more fear of death.

73
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,610
Platina is there?

74
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,100
Now, I would want some more information.

75
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:59,000
She says I'm a big egoiste.

76
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:20,490
She has the tendency to put down everyone who doesn't agree with her.

77
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:38,330
She has sometimes the impression that people are very small.

78
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:50,230
You see what I mean prescribe on essence?

79
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,900
This is prescribe on essence.

80
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:58,220
You don't care about the herpes, weather it is on the left side,

81
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,230
whether the tight clothes is very much Platina or not. You don't even look.

82
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:12,330
You go to the essence, you say this is Platina, give 10M and it will be cured.

83
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:21,970
But you see how some lack of information can distort the whole picture

84
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:26,080
and can lead us to different other remedies?

85
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:30,310
You see how the picture develops eventually?

86
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:33,310
It comes out and becomes alive and then you are sure.

87
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:38,140
This is what we mean prescribing on essence.

88
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,890
You forget the totality here and you see the fear of death of course is there

89
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:49,140
and other little things that you will not find in Platina but that does not matter.

90
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,500
You prescribe on essence and it's going to work.

91
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:18,490
We have some more minutes, you can ask questions.

92
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:45,900
What it means in terms of layers the weak vital force?

93
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:56,650
I don't use the weak vital force, the defense mechanism?

94
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:04,420
This is confused sometimes with the vitality.

95
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:15,560
A weak defense mechanism does not imply a weak vitality.

96
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,390
What do I mean by that?

97
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:33,540
I mean that a mental case which is incurable, you may have tremendous vitality,

98
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:40,550
a hyper-activity, vitality that he will never sleep, he goes on for hours and hours

99
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:48,460
and the strength is increased and all this tremendous vitality.

100
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:58,210
But the defense is broken down, it is deteriorated the defense mechanism.

101
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:05,790
So I would like you to differentiate between that.

102
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:14,800
You see somebody with great vitality, it's not always a sign of very good health

103
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:20,050
or he will live to 100 years old.

104
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:22,400
Tremendous vitality...

105
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:37,040
You will see cases of cancer, people dying at the age of 38, 42, 45 with tremendous vitality.

106
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:47,280
He was very vital, full of life, enjoying this, that, the picture of a very healthy man

107
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:52,280
and then they tell you he was looking very healthy, he had nothing.

108
00:17:55,130 --> 00:18:03,360
There is some kind of shock and the whole thing collapses.

109
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:12,890
The defenses behind are not in order and erupts the cancer...

110
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:23,210
And you see the person dies within a few months, no defenses at all.

111
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:34,900
So we must differentiate between the vitality and broken defense mechanism.

112
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,790
A defense, which is not in good order.

113
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,690
I didn't follow the argument.

114
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:25,620
-A person that had hay fever, who normally gets it from April to June, we treat him on April

115
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:35,710
so he had a month before he starts... what would you expect the reaction when the allergic season starts.

116
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:41,700
-If it is the right remedy, not to have the allergy.

117
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,580
-He wouldn't have it anymore?
-No.

118
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:53,530
I was thinking that you were enquiring on the same subject but you were talking on

119
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,140
a completely different thing.

120
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:02,660
He would have no more allergy or he would have very mild.

121
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,710
-What about an aggravation?

122
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:10,460
-She would an aggravation one month before. The aggravation might be a headache

123
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:15,150
or whatever it is after taking the remedy.

124
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:35,300
-...you expect when we give a remedy, if the remedy is correct those symptoms will disappear?

125
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,300
-Yes.

126
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:49,380
-Even if you think that there was amelioration but the herpes continue or skin eruption

127
00:20:49,480 --> 00:21:02,880
or the allergies we would assume that the remedy was correct and ...

128
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:31,710
-Yes, a few symtpoms can be from a deeper layer but talking about allergies

129
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:37,720
and when he comes for his allergy, that is the thing that bothers him,

130
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:41,460
you cannot say that that comes from a deeper layer.

131
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:52,710
From a deeper layer can come a sensitivity to onions, you cannot tolerate onions at all.

132
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:56,890
That may not be covered by the first remedy and it remains

133
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:03,800
together with a few other symptoms perhaps that will develop later with the next remedy.

134
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:11,990
But when he comes for the headache, the headache will be the first to go.

135
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:37,140
What it may happen is that the person may come for something light,

136
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:42,630
where in reality something is very serious with him.

137
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:50,140
So that which is light and which is more external may be aggravated in the process

138
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:55,730
and the others which are deeper problems, they get better.

139
00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:02,390
That may happen that the herpes may break out tremendously

140
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:09,490
by becoming better in her psychology, in her mental state.

141
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:15,390
-Another question about allergy.

142
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:22,640
People come in with acute and what I've been doing is I give them the remedy

143
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:32,140
that covers that and say come back in one month and I take again your case.

144
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:38,630
In the mean while you say that is not the right thing to do, did I understand you?

145
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:42,640
-Yes. It's not the right thing. Sometimes you don't have anything more to do

146
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:47,800
because the person does not give you symtpoms.

147
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:53,130
Even Kent comments on that particular question.

148
00:23:53,230 --> 00:24:00,380
He says if you don't know what to do, you prescribe a remedy...

149
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:08,140
he will come back on each own and then search for a better solution.

150
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:15,490
That is a little portion of the whole thing, what we are talking.

151
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:30,880
-We were discussing acute (?) It seems to me that the discussion on acute (?)

152
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:36,130
could be on some circumstances an acute otitis media on each own

153
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:39,130
and at other circumstances could be an acute exacerbation.

154
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:41,970
-Sure.

155
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:45,980
-So you have to differentiate that in your mind.

156
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:55,840
-What can happen is an acute but I was talking about a case that has been suffering

157
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:08,240
with recurrent otitis. But this can happen, to complete isolate an episode.

158
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:16,230
Like cold that then develops as a complication and goes to the ears.

159
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:22,340
-In case of migraine and headaches where the patient is Natrum Mur and when they have a migraine headache, they produce a picture of Bry

160
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,570
you think you you can give Natrum mur because it is all in one layer?

161
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:41,210
-No. In a case of migraine, you have a layer of Bryonia how? By what process?

162
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:46,220
-Every week they get a headache...

163
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:52,970
-The local symptoms indicate Bryonia and the general symptoms indicate Nat mur?

164
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:57,320
You give Nat mur, don't give Bryonia.

165
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,470
-You don't have to wait for the headache to leave?

166
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:05,730
-No. That belongs to the same pattern. That is what I did.

167
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:16,650
You say this picture is Bryonia? It doesn't mean that it is.

168
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:21,980
When I say you, I mean me or whoever says it.

169
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:32,140
-In the epidermic genital herpes there is (?)

170
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,970
In my experience, which is not so much, it is difficult to treat homeopathically

171
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:40,040
on what seems to be better but it's not really cured

172
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:50,440
and I wonder if the generation makes it difficult?
-Also probably the remedy is not correct.

173
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:57,930
You touch on similar remedy because people have just local symptoms

174
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:04,930
and they don't give you anymore symtpoms and you sometimes touch on a similar remedy

175
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:08,350
but not the similimum, not exactly.

176
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:13,600
And there is an amelioration for a while and then it comes back.

177
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:19,960
-Under more experienced homeopath obviously I thought that I got the wrong remedy.

178
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:29,850
-It's not easy to treat, I accept but the reaction that you are telling me

179
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:36,450
is because of the wrong remedy. But it's difficult to treat.
