1
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:32,700
-I just want you to tell what you want me to do first. How I am now or what happened since?

2
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,200
-What happened since.

3
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:46,550
-So I have to do that very quick. The last remedy was Causticum LM 3 I think

4
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,500
which you told me to stop and wait, so that's what I did.

5
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:58,390
-The Causticum you have taken?
-Yes last time I was on Causticum.

6
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:05,380
-You were on Causticum which you had taken yourself or somebody gave it to you.

7
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,870
-You through the VES gave it to me.

8
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,210
-I gave it to you?

9
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:16,480
-No, I did a repertorization and it was about so many points only Causticum.

10
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,380
-So you took Causticum and then what happened?

11
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:29,630
-Then it was quite OK, the sugar level went down and after I came here you told me

12
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:41,130
to stop the LM, I stopped and I let it run freely and the sugar level was in the morning

13
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:51,370
between 100-140. And 2 hours after food went up to 200, which normally is supposed

14
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,480
to go up to 140 only.

15
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:07,860
The 10th of October I had lot of cramps in my calves and at 14th I had the herpes

16
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:23,030
in my left nostril up, which I know it from before and I had hot flushes and I didn't have

17
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:35,530
my period since July 1999. Around the middle of October I had a nightmares and restless

18
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:47,030
and hot and cold and gas and diarrhea in the morning. I have almost stool in the morning

19
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:52,410
about half an hour after I wake up and start moving.

20
00:02:53,660 --> 00:03:00,310
It's always like gas and with urine together.

21
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:10,560
-With a lot of gas like an explosion?
-Yes, always like an explosion.

22
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:15,280
-Always explosion in the morning?
-Yes.

23
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:28,410
-Can you give me symptoms that are all along, instead of saying one day I had this and

24
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:37,660
one day I had that, give me symptoms you had all along, so I get an idea, a basic idea.

25
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:45,410
-OK, so I'm not going to tell... OK I have a list of them, I wrote them down,

26
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:46,590
so I can tell you.

27
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:58,740
There are a few things that happened during the time which are important I think.

28
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:08,740
Last year after I came back from here I had lot of energy and I opened the clinic attached

29
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,590
to my office, I was very happy about it but all the time I felt that I'm going to die,

30
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:24,340
I'm not going to the New Millennium, like I'm finishing to the end of 99, I had a knowledge.

31
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:35,160
I knew I'm going to die, I'm not going to move on the second Millennium. I didn't fear it at all,

32
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:51,410
I've just been sad to leave the family and my daughter got married, I had a grandson in July,

33
00:04:52,700 --> 00:05:02,570
which made me very happy. Still now, it's like I feel like I fell in love the first time.

34
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:17,910
It's funny but when I hold him there is so much love. Then my other daughter got married

35
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:32,250
and I decided if anyway I'm going to die at the end of the year I better go and do something.

36
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:39,660
I wanted to see New Zealand, the things in the country were very bad for me the last year.

37
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:47,750
There were new rules, so at work I couldn't function as I like.

38
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:59,520
It's like they made me do things which are illegal through these rules, I felt while

39
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:12,360
I'm doing it I'm cheating. Like they sent volunteers before to (?) and they came to work

40
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:21,030
and all kind of tricks, people want them to do other things,

41
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:30,270
some companies wanted to bring them as foreign workers, so they start doing all kind of things,

42
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,870
paying money.

43
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:44,530
They changed the rules and I came to a point that I could send them, it didn't bother to

44
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:52,690
send them, I could send them and continue make a living but I told companies abroad that

45
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:58,770
it's illegal, they won't get a visa, they have to come in as a tourist and lie because

46
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:06,030
the farmers need them and they wanted these jobs, so all the sides wanted and people closed

47
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:11,380
their eyes but still I felt I can't.

48
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:27,280
So I just left the office, I left my daughters doing it, I felt very bad with it and

49
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:45,290
during last year, when I got diabetes, when I got the flu, I had an income tax inquiring.

50
00:07:46,540 --> 00:08:01,670
I think it also came through these people and they wanted to check from 1994  till 1997,

51
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:09,270
then they add 1998 also and they treat me like a thief, they treated me so bad.

52
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:20,250
They said that the income went down and they want to know why, that probably I get money

53
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:27,940
from the companies who send the people and all kind of things which really annoyed me,

54
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,590
I was so angry, I shouted to them. They used to call me, making themselves like

55
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:38,190
they are calling the accountant by mistake and really hussle.

56
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:42,420
They were coming into my office which they are not allowed to, they have to deal with my

57
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:53,520
accountant not with me and then I got the diabetes and I was so angry.

58
00:08:54,530 --> 00:09:00,110
One day I shouted to them, I said if you are a liar and you cheat, that's why you call me that.

59
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,610
So I didn't call you a liar, you behave like this.

60
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:10,260
You put me in a position that I can't do nothing, if these people come to you,

61
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:17,760
you can't do nothing, it doesn't matter what you say, you show them, you take everything out,

62
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:27,340
they go into every little detail of your life and you are helpless, the same with the government,

63
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,670
with these new rules that one clerk decided that because she is afraid of certain people.

64
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,820
So they put you...

65
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:45,920
-All this affected your health and the diabetes went up, what happened?

66
00:09:48,670 --> 00:10:01,430
-I did get sugar, I didn't have before, I got a flu in March, last March 1999

67
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:11,420
and then I took the antibiotics and then within 5 days I had 700 sugar but I was so stressed.

68
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:19,570
After I look back I know that all the things together, these rules and the context and

69
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:27,070
everything was. On one side I wanted to get rid of this office actually.

70
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:34,820
I thought about cutting it, quitting and moving in full Homeopathy but I needed, you can't do it

71
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:41,760
because you owe people things, I had it for 20 years, you can't cut everything in one time.

72
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:46,090
Maybe because of my thinking about finishing what happened.

73
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:56,340
I always think that there is a connection, when you think about things, things come to help you

74
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,600
but not this way.
I wasn't ready.

75
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:07,200
-You decided to continue.

76
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:15,180
-My daughter got married in September and just a week before she got married

77
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:22,680
when the course started and I decided that I had enough from this crazy country and

78
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,130
if I'm not going out,

79
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:31,840
I'm going to have either heart attack or stroke because the pressure was so hard and the anger,

80
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:39,440
I used to go like this, I felt my head is blowing, so strong.

81
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:45,380
So I just went and booked a tour in New Zealand and then I said if it's New Zealand

82
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,730
then I go to Australia also, I took all my savings and ...

83
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,090
-You went for how long?

84
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:58,080
-A month and a half. I left beginning of November.

85
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:02,080
-This helped you health wise?

86
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:12,130
-Mentally great, fantastic. I took with me LM Causticum.

87
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,130
-Emotionally?

88
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:23,380
-Emotionally it was good. I had time to think about things and enjoy myself, really I had

89
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,730
full out of the problems.

90
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:34,230
When I came back I had income tax again and problems again but whatever.

91
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:44,880
-What I want to know is if you can give me some steady symptoms that were going on

92
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:53,380
all the time, for instance pressure was all the time, it's still there?

93
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:59,560
-This pressure is not there anymore, it's gone.

94
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,380
-The investigation has ended finally?

95
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:08,810
-Ended finally, I had to pay them cash some amount of money and get rid of it.

96
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:14,140
And that annoys me a lot because if I don't owe them, I don't owe them.

97
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:23,040
They couldn't find nothing but that's life, that's what is going on, so it's annoying.

98
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:27,040
-And you felt the injustice?

99
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:37,040
-Yes, there is a lot of injustice but now I came to know that I can't fight, I'm helpless,

100
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:43,790
I'm not strong enough to do it. All my life I used to fight, I used to stand, I used to do things.

101
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:47,540
Now the farmers call me why don't you do something to change the rules.

102
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:53,540
I said, that's it enough, 20 years I do the fights for you, now if you don't do it yourself

103
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:58,110
I don't care, I close the office and you get whatever you are supposed to get.

104
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:05,290
That's it, I just retreated, I went home, I'm at home now, I don't go to work,

105
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,300
I give good salaries.

106
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:23,030
The 5th of January we had flood, a lot of rains and the rain came at night into a terrace.

107
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:29,790
I live in the first floor and the water came this high into my clinic and ruined everything.

108
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,440
All the carpets, everything.

109
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,440
-But now you work with Homeopathy?

110
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:40,710
-A little bit, not much, I just had to take the carpets off and wait until they dry.

111
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:46,060
-But can you give me some of the symptoms?

112
00:14:51,330 --> 00:15:06,880
-When the sugar goes up, when I'm eating I feel heavy, eyes are heavy, every time,

113
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:18,010
I feel dizzy.
-After eating you feel dizzy?

114
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:29,920
-While and after but the most important thing was that in Australia I had high blood sugar

115
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:39,920
and I walked around the icy rock, it's 9 km which we did in 2 hours and after the walk,

116
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:47,720
after we rested already suddenly I felt like somebody putting nails in my big toe.

117
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,410
-You could not move your feet.

118
00:15:50,510 --> 00:16:03,580
-No, it was like somebody hit, terrible pain, I put Rescue fluid and then Arnica cream and

119
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,280
it went away.

120
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:15,750
But since then every time I ate, I had stitching pain in my big toe and both of them...

121
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:16,500
-Every time?

122
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:33,330
-Every time I ate, it's very unique. When I came home I did repertorization and Calcarea

123
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:41,250
and Carbo veg came up but I didn't have the cold for the Calcarea and I was not dead

124
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:43,680
enough for the Carbo veg.

125
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:53,990
So I took this symptom, this keynote and I came to Magnesia suplhurica which was the only one,

126
00:16:55,590 --> 00:17:03,940
extremities pain toes first, dinner after. It's Magnesia sulphurica the one,

127
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:11,330
I went first to the Materia Medica, it's very small, very little.

128
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:20,070
I read it and many of those symptoms agreed with what I felt and I took Magnesia Sulphurica.

129
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:31,080
-What potency?
-LM 3. I did it for about 2 months.

130
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:34,080
-That means from March?

131
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:54,910
-From beginning of January to... I stopped it when I had abscess, the 17th of February

132
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:58,910
I had an abscess, you remember that I told you last time that I had one?

133
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:09,910
It grew again, I brought a photo this time. But only for the beginning, and that's when it started

134
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:14,450
and this is also the finger nail that became in brown.

135
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:22,470
-This is in the beginning or this is ...?

136
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:32,120
-This is in the beginning when it just started. My husband wanted to take a photo

137
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,470
when it was bigger, it's disgusting.

138
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,410
-But did you open it?

139
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:43,800
-No, I took the case and I prepared the cream with a few medicines and I put it

140
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,390
and then it went down again.

141
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:50,030
-Why it is brown?

142
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:58,470
-I cleaned it. I had nail polish when it happened and a month later I cleaned it,

143
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:04,370
I was in Hong Kong already and I found out that that's the color. It was brown.

144
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:16,070
Now since March after the Mag sulph it started growing again underneath

145
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,090
and it's coming off now.

146
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:32,620
-So after this tumor that came out, is this tumor opened and discharged?

147
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,120
-Yes it is open and discharged by itself.
-What color?

148
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:55,360
-Very green pus, green, yellowish, grey pus but it did open by itself after I prepared cream

149
00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:00,780
and put it on because I have experience with this one. I already went to surgery

150
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,780
and they opened it twice, it happened before and it grows again.

151
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:11,130
-How many times it has happened?
-3-4 times during the last years.

152
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:25,360
-Continue, just give me the symptoms that are steady.

153
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:31,210
-I tell you what is the symptoms that are steady now.

154
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:38,960
-But can you just forget this, just give me from your memory.

155
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,740
-That's a main symptom.
-Don't look.

156
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,870
-OK.
-Whatever you remember.

157
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:51,110
-First is the memory, it's very bad.
-Forgetting what?

158
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:57,910
-Everything, I forget everything. If I want to go and take something, by the time I go and

159
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:05,900
take it, I forget what I want to take. If I want to say a word, it doesn't come.

160
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,750
I have to think like in the computer and then it comes and my husband starts laughing.

161
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:19,910
-Weak memory for what you have to do and weak memory for words.

162
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:31,590
-What I have done, what I have to do, letters are switching, words are switching,

163
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,340
everything to do with memory, so poor, really poor.

164
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:50,090
-What else?
-Sweating is always in the head.

165
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,270
-And cervical back?

166
00:21:52,370 --> 00:22:02,240
-Cervical and forehead. And groins. That I have for long time. When I sweat,

167
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:15,340
I sweat in the groins and it smells like ammonia, like sperm, it smells funny.

168
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:17,250
-Male sperm?

169
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,580
-Yes like male sperm.

170
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:36,000
But only in the groins not anywhere else.

171
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:19,950
I have strong pains still in my finger joints, especially in the left and in the morning more.

172
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:27,900
I found out that in the morning I have the aggravation usually, like the high blood pressure

173
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:35,250
is in the morning, diarrhea in the morning, the pain in the fingers is in the morning.

174
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:42,750
-When you say morning the moment you wake up or after an hour?

175
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:54,230
-It could be after half an hour. The numbness on my feet, the soles of the feet numbed

176
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:55,730
in the morning.

177
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,230
-Numbness of feet or soles?

178
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:11,480
-Soles, not the feet, it's the soles and finger tips, also this part of the fingers in the feet

179
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,360
and the soles.

180
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,330
Even though they are very sensitive.

181
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:36,080
And my soles are very sensitive, always been.

182
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:51,060
When I was a child I couldn't let my mother to cut the nails and I can't go to pedicure

183
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:54,800
it's too much, I can't walk without shoes.

184
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:08,370
I need fresh air and it's not enough, I need it to be moving, fanning, I have right now eczema

185
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:20,720
between my fingers, which I had when I was young teenager and after pregnancies I had it also.

186
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:30,220
I have a funny thing the last 2 years about sex.

187
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:38,620
First of all my sex desire is gone, it's not there anymore.

188
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,970
-Completely?
-Completely.

189
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,720
-Aversion?

190
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:53,570
-I can't say aversion but it's not there, indifference but there is something

191
00:25:53,670 --> 00:26:00,560
which is embarrassing. I see a movie and a movie doesn't have to be a blue movie.

192
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:07,460
Normal movies today have sex parts in it, people kissing, caressing, I can't see it.

193
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:10,570
-Why?

194
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:24,570
-Embarrasses me. I don't know why. It was not like this, the last 2 years I think.

195
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,280
Blue movies I never could see.
-Blue what do you mean?

196
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,610
-Blue movie I say sex movies, these ones I can't see, I never could.

197
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:41,790
-It's disgusting.
-I feel bad, I don't feel good with it.

198
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:54,040
I'm still sensitive to reprimands, if my husband tells me something I get very offended.

199
00:26:56,790 --> 00:27:06,870
I still can't sleep in the afternoon, I avoided because I feel very bad when I wake up and

200
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:13,470
that's since I was a child, always. My mother says that she has it also.

201
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,590
-What time is this?

202
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:26,320
-If it will be 1 o'clock it's still kind of morning for me but if it goes towards 4 o'clock and

203
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:35,290
go to sleep then, then when I wake up I feel so bad, like vomiting, funny headache.

204
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:41,290
Something is wrong. I prefer to go through and sleep till the morning because

205
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:49,390
when I wake up I feel so bad that I can't stand it. So normally I never go to sleep.

206
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:51,620
-Do you know this symptom to which remedy belongs?

207
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,050
-It belongs to Staphysagria but it belongs to others too.

208
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:06,790
I don't go to sleep and I have a break between 3.30 and 4.30, especially here that

209
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:14,540
I want to go to sleep, I'm so tired but I never go to sleep, I always find something to do.

210
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,540
Everybody goes to sleep and I don't even lie down because I'm afraid that I go to sleep

211
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,720
and I then I wake up bad.

212
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,150
-What position do you sleep?

213
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:35,620
-I sleep first on the right, then I can turn to the back, now I found that I'm sleeping putting

214
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:42,730
my head underneath the pillow and my feet is one up and the other one like this or like that.

215
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:46,120
-One straight and one flexed.

216
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:53,860
-One is like this up, this one is up and this one is down on the bed.

217
00:28:55,610 --> 00:29:03,700
That's how I sleep all my life and I have to be covered the feet outside,

218
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:09,100
everything here outside, I have to be outside.

219
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,260
-The feet must be outside?

220
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:27,960
-In the summer yes and I sleep with feathers in the summer. I put it like this,

221
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:31,060
only in the abdomen.

222
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,810
-So you feel cold in the abdomen?

223
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:41,660
-I don't know, it's like covering it, like taking precautions, I don't know why.

224
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:49,160
Also when I see a movie I found myself always putting my hands like this.

225
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:59,310
-Protecting your heart.

226
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:12,720
-Protecting here, I start looking at little things to give you some more special things.

227
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:20,320
Ascending I can't. I can walk for hours if it is straight, if it is ascending it is impossible.

228
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,610
I love animals.

229
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:49,620
Salt, it went up so high.

230
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,520
-Desire for salt?

231
00:30:52,620 --> 00:31:02,710
-Yes people tell me that I just put thick salt, really a lot of salt and the desire

232
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:10,610
for sweet is up but only before menses. In the period that I didn't have the menses

233
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:20,940
for nearly a year I still had the symptoms but the menses never showed up.

234
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,440
-Premesntrual Without menses?

235
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:34,440
-Yes and in March the sugar was very high and I went to a homeopath that I know and

236
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:42,620
I wanted him to take my case and he decided on Laminitis you know the butterfly.

237
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:53,660
It's some kind of a new remedy made from butterfly. I didn't want to touch anything.

238
00:31:54,410 --> 00:32:01,120
I take a butterfly and I fly like a butterfly, so I asked to be sent from England the proving.

239
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:07,770
It's by Nancy Herrick and I read it, the symptoms that he took were right

240
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:12,530
but when you read the proving it's different. They take the symptoms

241
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:17,870
but they don't correlate so much, it's very general, so it was different.

242
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:26,020
Then we had a seminar and we learned about Folliculinum and the symptoms that he decided to

243
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,530
give me the butterfly were in Folliculinum.

244
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:34,870
It was first timeI saw Folliculinum so clear, so I decided I take Folliculinum.

245
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,770
-What potency?

246
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:49,620
-LM 1 once, it was enough, it nearly killed me. I took the Folliculinum beginning of April one time.

247
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:59,280
Then 2 weeks later I had diarrhea and pain in my stomach, I felt really bad and

248
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:10,630
later I had my period, after I didn't have it for a year. And 28 passed and I had it again,

249
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,380
I still have it already for 10 days.

250
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:22,540
That's what the Folliculinum did I think. I don't know because in the middle I took Nux vomica

251
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:30,020
because I felt so bad, I had heart burn. That's another thing that happens to me a few times

252
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:35,620
but I take always Nux 30 in water and it helps.

253
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:48,940
Through sleep I'm vomiting acid, it's like the stomach contents go up in my sleep and

254
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:57,770
the acid really burns the esophagus from inside, it's terrible and I wake up like this and

255
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:00,120
running to vomit it.

256
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:10,290
So Nux vomica really helps in that. I took it 14th of April.

257
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:12,720
-How many times?

258
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:22,770
-I took twice and I took once, then I took it again in the middle of May that it happened again

259
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:36,460
and that's it. I found out that the main problem which makes me sick, like I can have flu

260
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:40,060
or something, it's conflicts.

261
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:48,660
If I'm in a conflict like I have to do this and if I do this I'll hurt this one and

262
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:51,900
if I do that one, I hurt that one.

263
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,330
I'm in the middle and I can't do nothing, I feel so bad and I just become sick,

264
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,400
all my life was like this.

265
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:07,660
I don't want to hurt this one and I don't want to hurt that one and I'm in the middle.

266
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:13,410
What happened the last few months, I think mentally I'm much better.

267
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:23,060
I went back home I'm happy suddenly after 20 years I'm happy to clean,

268
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:27,060
I'm happy to throw out things from the house, I'm happy to cook,

269
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:31,410
I'm happy to see my grand son but I get tired very easily.

270
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:38,160
It's like I went back home to save myself, to protect myself.

271
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:41,310
-You mean from Australia?

272
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:51,620
-No, from work, from outside. I wake up when I feel like it, I do what I feel, I feel safe.

273
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:57,720
-You feel safe and you feel good. But why you are so sensitive, you cry so much?

274
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,620
-Always.

275
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:07,450
-It's now or lately you became sensitive?
-All my life was like this.

276
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:09,550
-But you are more now.
-Yes.

277
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:18,700
-Do you know why you cry? Is it because you pity yourself?

278
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:26,220
-There is something in my life that I also question why I cry. Because I can cry when I see

279
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:34,300
somebody misfortune, some person who was with Down syndrome in the street I can cry.

280
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:41,400
If I see a mental case I can cry. I can cry with my patients and I can also cry when I see

281
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:50,550
beautiful scenery, a beautiful flower and a baby, it brings my emotions up.

282
00:36:52,300 --> 00:37:05,210
-Yes but the emotions can be happy? They can be happy, this or that but in you it brings tears.

283
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:14,550
-It's like a switch, if I'm angry, I cry very easily when I'm angry, when I'm frustrated.

284
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:19,950
-Can you tell me why you cry now?

285
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:27,710
-I don't know. I try to investigate, that's what I'm doing the last few months and what

286
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:36,450
I'm thinking when I look back in my life is that my emotions are triggered by expressions.

287
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:45,970
By other people. I can feel emotional through something else.

288
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:56,680
When I take a case for instance or I hear a case and somebody is saying something,

289
00:37:56,780 --> 00:38:03,680
it goes through my feelings, it goes immediately inside, only up to here, not more than that.

290
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:12,680
-But it is sympathetic, it's suffering together but now you suffer together with yourself.

291
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:18,930
Can you say that seeing yourself suffering, you cry, can you say that?

292
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:27,430
-Yes, it could be.
-You say why do I suffer, why I have to suffer?

293
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:37,030
-Yes, I don't think I feel pity, I feel angry, I feel helpless, that makes me...

294
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:49,810
Because I used to handle things all my life by myself and I can't handle them anymore.

295
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:56,210
-But now you don't have the responsibilities anymore.

296
00:38:56,310 --> 00:39:01,760
-No but how can I treat patients when I'm sick?

297
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:07,730
-Yes but why do you have to treat patients?

298
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:17,380
Because you like it? Why you want to treat?

299
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:28,130
-I tell you. When I went to Homeopathy I was naive. I saw a way to clear this world from

300
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:35,980
all the sicknesses and now slowly I found out that it's not that easy.

301
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:47,880
It's difficult and it's not for sure and I can harm people also because the way I pass the remedy,

302
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:53,730
I go to hell and back and I'm not always sure that it wouldn't happen to the person I treat.

303
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:59,390
I'm scared. I don't want to make any harm to anybody.

304
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:10,140
-Yes but what I say is, you gave up your main job and why if treating people makes you

305
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,990
feel so uncomfortable?

306
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:21,320
-No, it feels great when I solve somebody's problem it feels good, it's the best thing that

307
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,910
could happen, I feel so happy.

308
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:29,220
-You feel happy?
-When he feels good, when I help them.

309
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:34,610
-When they come back and tell you they feel good, not when they have problems.

310
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:39,010
-When they have problems, I have problems, I can't go into the suffering.

311
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:41,760
It's so hard for me.

312
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:52,410
-It's so hard to go into their suffering. Why is so hard? To listen?

313
00:40:52,510 --> 00:41:00,950
-I take it personally, it touches me, then it takes me away.

314
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:06,850
-But this is not good. To see patients if you feel so...

315
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:13,100
-I know, I stopped doing it. I don't do it.
-If you are so much affected.

316
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:24,340
-I told you I went home, I retreat. At home I feel safe, I do things that I know how to do

317
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,190
and I don't harm anybody.

318
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:39,140
-But do you feel the need for protection?
-Always. I never had it but...

319
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:44,650
-Maybe you had but not so much as you would like to have it.

320
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:47,240
-No, I always took care of myself.

321
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:53,890
-Your husband did not protect you?
-No.

322
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:55,930
-You protected him?

323
00:41:56,030 --> 00:42:15,240
-Usually yes. He is strong but in some ways. He can't press the right buttons.

324
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:18,740
That's our karma together.

325
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,590
-Does he work or he stays at home?

326
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:33,660
-No he works, he told me give up your job, I'll take care of you. I'll take care of the family,

327
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:40,910
I don't need the money that you bring, everything will be fine but always I wanted to be independent.

328
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:55,910
I don't like him to tell me what to do. I was at home about 10 years when I got married,

329
00:42:57,190 --> 00:43:04,810
I nearly went to asylum, I could not. I have to do something and it's the first time in my life

330
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:12,250
that I retreat. I never did it but what can I do?

331
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,910
I don't find any solution.

332
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:30,150
-Do you feel that at this moment you become like a pensioner?

333
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:31,400
-Yes.

334
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:37,650
-You feel that and you don't like it, is that correct? On one hand you don't like it,

335
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:38,980
on the other hand you like it.

336
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:47,980
-I like it a lot now because it's the first time I'm not stressed, I'm not obsessed about things,

337
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:57,060
I don't care. I don't care if I have this kind of sofa or this one and now my daughter bought a house,

338
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:06,800
an apartment and she is choosing the floor and I go crazy, what do you care if it's red or white?

339
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:14,400
It's not important. Really there are so many things that are important and this is not important.

340
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:21,300
I came to a phase in my life where money is not important, nothing is important actually

341
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:25,900
except health, except my little baby.

342
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:32,150
I go crazy if something happens to him or something happens to my daughters.

343
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:40,720
I worry about their health. There is another thing, if I know that they are supposed to come

344
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:46,640
and they are late I go crazy, I think in a minute I see pictures in front of my eyes,

345
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:47,990
like an accident.

346
00:44:54,150 --> 00:45:00,300
I see visions like it was an accident and my husband always say,

347
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,140
why do you see the bad things?

348
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:09,540
Maybe she enjoys herself and she didn't come but she was abroad, she was supposed to call me,

349
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:16,390
she came in the middle of the night and she didn't call. I was scared.

350
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:19,730
-How is your thirst?
-I don't drink at all.

351
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:24,680
-What do you drink?

352
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:32,260
-Anything that have lemon in it, like refreshing. I can't drink water, I hate water.

353
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:40,530
Another story was in the dentist, I can't stand when he does it and there is water, I just choke.

354
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:44,760
He said that he never had a drowning patient before, I always drawn,

355
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:46,760
so he has a special thing for me.

356
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:50,400
He put some kind like a balloon and the water goes out.

357
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:59,520
Another funny incident with the dentist was that he made a filling, he gave me injection

358
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:11,150
without adrenaline and then when the injection finished my half tongue stayed without taste.

359
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,520
-For how long?

360
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:21,260
-A month and a half till I went again to him. Now the second time that I came to him,

361
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:28,010
I asked for the tube, I wanted to make homeopathic remedy from this anesthesia stuff

362
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:35,010
and then he didn't make any injection and then when he made the filling I felt very sour on

363
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:42,500
my tongue and I asked him what is that and he said when it is anaesthetized I couldn't feel it

364
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:49,690
and I asked him what is it and he said, it's Phosphoric acid.

365
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:56,050
He put it inside the tooth to make little holes because there is a new white filling

366
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:57,490
that have to old.

367
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:05,540
I took the tube, I went home, by the time I went home it's gone this thing.

368
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:12,190
I felt the taste again because half of the tongue had no taste. He said he never had anything

369
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:17,290
like this before. I don't know, I think it's the Phosphoric acid maybe.

370
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:30,380
Aversion touch, brittle nails, my nails are broken all the time, always.

371
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:41,380
-You feel better now you cried?
-Yes.

372
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:56,470
-Other times also you have cried but this time you really cried quite a lot.

373
00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:08,300
Do you lately cry a lot would you say?
-Not a lot. I'm embarrassed, I'm not crying.

374
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:12,730
-But do you have tendency to cry?

375
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:20,980
-Yes I have tendency to cry. When I was a child, if somebody just looked at me that I thought that

376
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:29,210
he is thinking bad at me, I used to cry, very easy to cry, when I get angry,

377
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:34,950
when I get frustrated, when I see something beautiful, when I see something sad, movies.

378
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:39,300
My husband always laugh and he says even in the comedies I cry.

379
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:06,710
I can't go into myself. I have a feeling that I can't connect mental, physical and emotional.

380
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:16,120
It's like I stuck here, I hardly remember anything from my childhood.

381
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:25,060
-I don't understand that because you have so many feelings, how is that possible?

382
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,840
You are saying something opposite from what I see.

383
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:37,810
-Yes it's so funny. That's what I want to know. It's amazing because I can't do meditation

384
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:45,220
for instance, I cant' meditate, I get irritable. I think if I do it, I'll be better now,

385
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,550
I'll try to do it again.

386
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:58,910
-Tell me about darkness? You feel good in dark?
-No, it's unknown, I don't like it.

387
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:02,390
-But you are afraid?

388
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:07,390
-At home yes I can go in the dark and put a light but I wouldn't go in the street in the dark.

389
00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:12,890
I didn't go to live in Melia Bay because I thought I will have to walk from here in the evening

390
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:23,890
and I' scared that somebody is there. I also don't dive in the sea which is very dark,

391
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:26,240
it's frightening.

392
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:31,990
It's the unknown. I have to be in control all the time.

393
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:45,490
I feel through other people feelings.

394
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:52,140
-What do you mean? If somebody is happy, you will be happy?

395
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,340
-Yes, I'll be very happy.

396
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:56,390
-If somebody is sad, you will become sad. Is that what you say?

397
00:50:56,490 --> 00:51:07,190
-Yes. When you gave me Phosphorus it was OK, it was much better but now it's again.

398
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:22,810
I have a problem with robbers. I dream.

399
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:29,480
-Maybe they start stealing in Israel more and more.

400
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:40,410
-No, it's the last few years, I have dreams about robbers, they rob me. It has to do with work,

401
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:45,710
2 weeks ago I had a dream that somebody took my credit card and I woke up and

402
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:55,310
I looked in the bag if it is there. Real fear of robbers, it's very strong.

403
00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:05,310
And last time when I was here I left my bag behind and it was...

404
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:26,210
It's like it goes in and out immediately. Everything in my body is like this.

405
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:33,470
If I eat something, it wants to go out immediately. Everything I throw out, the same with the feeling,

406
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:38,560
it goes in and I throw it out. I don't let it be in.

407
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:43,310
-You are affected very much.

408
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:21,510
We noted down, Marguerite noted down 29 symptoms and

409
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:30,010
I would like you to focus your attention, show the symptoms.

410
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:53,600
Every symptoms that she mentioned weeping from anger, weeping easily, sympathetic,

411
00:53:53,700 --> 00:54:00,550
anxiety for others, complain brittle nails, fear of dark, fear of robbers, aversion water,

412
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:06,650
all the symptoms she mentioned is here and you will see something very interesting.

413
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:18,930
I could not believe that this computer could do this. I could not believe.

414
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:20,530
-What?

415
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:33,780
-I will show you just now. I will show you a phenomenon you've never seen before

416
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:35,810
in any case.

417
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:41,030
What, is that the case?

418
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:52,460
I told you not to change anything when I left you there?

419
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:57,050
-I didn't change.
-But it was Phosphorus first. What do you mean?

420
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:08,710
Anyhow, forget it, it doesn't matter. Show me the other.

421
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,910
Just the Expert System where it makes a decision.

422
00:55:51,210 --> 00:56:01,360
It says I can not make a decision. The previous repertorization when I left it was even better,

423
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:05,000
almost all remedies were coming almost the same.

424
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:12,110
All the remedies they have almost the same symptoms, 5 symptoms for each remedy,

425
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:13,300
different symptoms.

426
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,370
This is very interesting, why? Even that repertorization where she changed,

427
00:56:21,470 --> 00:56:23,250
I don't know what she changed.

428
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:34,220
Fear of robbers take it out, these 3 last symptoms.

429
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:44,910
-It's very strong, don't take it out.
-Don't worry, we don't take it out.

430
00:56:51,910 --> 00:57:02,560
When I left I said don't change anything because what I wanted to show you,

431
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:04,220
what happened with her case.

432
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:09,550
We prescribed Phosphorus initially and she was doing better and she took remedies

433
00:57:09,650 --> 00:57:14,650
after remedies after remedies and we arrived back at the Phos state.

434
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:20,550
This is what I have been teaching you all the time. She spoiled the case, it doesn't matter

435
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:23,070
but this was a fact.

436
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:27,800
When I left the room I looked at the repertorization, it was almost all the remedies coming,

437
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:29,150
Phos first.

438
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:32,650
All remedies were coming with the same.

439
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:43,800
This is what I say, don't interfere. You think you are helping yourself but actually after 5,

440
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:52,480
after 10, after 20 months then you will find the effect on the right prescriptions.

441
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:58,630
Don't expect that from one day to the other.

442
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:12,880
You changed something, I don't know what. It was very interesting because the moment I decided

443
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:20,880
she has come back to Phos, I said show me and there it was Phos and then Arsenicum and

444
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:26,400
then this, that, almost the same size of columns.

445
00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:36,050
The computer says I can not make a decision of course. So therefore we don't have to talk

446
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:41,630
very much about it, we start all over again from the beginning.

447
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:52,630
I believe Phosphorus will act again. You see how she is open, she says I have no skin,

448
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:57,480
no protection, I have no protection.

449
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:03,620
Again the same thing. In the beginning she was not as bad as she is now.

450
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:13,970
If you evaluate the first prescription with the prescription today, today state is much worse,

451
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:22,470
it is much more unprotected, much more open to external influences.

452
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:45,120
She could not stop crying, she did not know why she is crying and therefore it is very important

453
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:57,400
to understand that the evaluation of a situation is even more important than the correct remedy.

454
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:03,540
Because you give the right remedy, you evaluate correctly, good.

455
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:11,290
You give the wrong remedy, you evaluate correctly, good. I gave the wrong remedy. I know.

456
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:16,400
Now what do I have to do? I have to give another remedy of course.

457
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:26,040
I gave the right remedy, what do I have to do? Wait until I see really that the remedy

458
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:33,090
has exhausted its action, that a new remedy is coming up, the same remedy, the same thing.

459
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:54,460
Therefore we can not say of course that we gave one remedy and then don't take another one.

460
01:00:55,640 --> 01:01:04,460
No, we don't say that. But if you take another one, you make sure that the other one is correct also

461
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:10,810
and then you will have an evolution which is positive in the end.

462
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:18,560
That's all. You make one mistake, you have to know that this was a mistake.

463
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:31,540
Even that the patient may come and say, I feel better. Feel better it doesn't mean anything,

464
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,390
as you understand.

465
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:43,480
Therefore we have a state of Phosphorus which is not confirmed.

466
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:47,400
I asked her about thirst, she says, no thirst.

467
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:51,400
-The first time I didn't have either.

468
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:58,950
-Also because we were battling between Pulsatilla and Phosphorus because Pulsatilla was thirstless

469
01:01:59,050 --> 01:02:10,150
and should we give Phos? But you see now much more clear the openness of Phos, unprotection,

470
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:14,490
the lack of protection from others towards feelings, thoughts etc.

471
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:22,890
Phos has no protection, they don't know what to do. They say I feel somebody and

472
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:29,910
I live through the other person, it is terrible. It's not a pleasant situation.

473
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:42,690
And then the anxiety comes of course about others and what is going to happen to my child, to my...

474
01:02:49,410 --> 01:02:54,590
-The sensitivity to the menopause or being in that process coming to this?

475
01:02:54,690 --> 01:02:56,390
-To this case?
-Yes.

476
01:02:56,490 --> 01:03:11,570
-This case is not clear. If you look, if you analyze why, why, why, you will see 5 symptoms

477
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:21,810
from this remedy, 5 symptoms from another remedy, 5 from another...

478
01:03:21,910 --> 01:03:29,310
There is no way. If you say where is that symptom, that means out of 29 you can say 24 where

479
01:03:29,410 --> 01:03:30,810
are the symptoms;.

480
01:03:30,910 --> 01:03:38,510
Yet the main, the essence is more towards Phosphorus.

481
01:03:38,610 --> 01:03:48,470
-Going to menopause being more sensitive? Where is that? Weeping?

482
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:55,160
-Normal menopause would be nothing, nobody would understand.

483
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:05,820
it is not because of menopause that you have symptoms. No, you have symptoms

484
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,610
during menopause because you are sick.

485
01:04:10,610 --> 01:04:16,010
She took a remedy for 1 week, for 2 weeks I felt very good, for 1 day I felt very good,

486
01:04:16,110 --> 01:04:23,220
for 2 days I felt very good. This is always with her almost except of a few remedies

487
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:25,390
which aggravated.

488
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:27,890
-With Mercury I was suffering.

489
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:37,890
-But the fact is in the end you have no positive results because you don't allow the

490
01:04:37,990 --> 01:04:44,990
remedy to reach a point where it will show the next possibility.

491
01:04:46,010 --> 01:04:50,990
So this is very important because here we take the cases in order to learn.

492
01:04:51,490 --> 01:05:02,560
It is not only to say bravo to George or she gave a good case, we all learn.

493
01:05:07,060 --> 01:05:14,630
-George, so you never take the rubrics with menopause in consideration?

494
01:05:14,730 --> 01:05:23,130
-Menopause as long as you have symptoms because of menopause but

495
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:26,480
menopause as a rubric is not correct.

496
01:05:26,650 --> 01:05:37,050
Flushes of heat yes, depression during menopause yes and all the symptoms you will take

497
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:42,800
but menopause is not supposed to have symptoms in a  woman.

498
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:49,600
The menopause is supposed to go through without, either with very little changes or not at all.

499
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:57,470
We say, oh yes you have depression because of menopause.

500
01:05:57,570 --> 01:06:02,150
Because of menopause but still it is a depression.

501
01:06:07,070 --> 01:06:19,300
What I want to impress in your mind that if you give homeopathic remedies because many times

502
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:20,550
you have been angry.

503
01:06:20,650 --> 01:06:27,230
You say, why George don't allow us to take a homeopathic remedy and you tell us take aspirin?

504
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:32,730
For this reason, because the homeopathic remedy acts much deeper.

505
01:06:33,230 --> 01:06:40,870
Aspirin will act on a very superficial level and will go over an acute much more milder

506
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:46,300
than if you take the wrong homeopathic remedy because in an acute you may need

507
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:53,290
2-3 homeopathic remedies and then back again, back again, back again.

508
01:06:53,390 --> 01:06:58,300
You may treat 20 years a person and you bring him back again and again and

509
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:03,390
finally is on the same state, as the initial state.

510
01:07:03,890 --> 01:07:11,290
Still this person will say thank you very much, I was good with Causticum, I was good with Arnica,

511
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:17,540
I was good with Phos, I was good with this,I was good with that. It's no good.

512
01:07:18,390 --> 01:07:25,540
And of course I will never impose somebody, I'm teaching theoretically now,

513
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:32,140
what each one wants to do, I will never say, don't do it.

514
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:40,970
If you like to do it, you do it but theoretically you have to understand that this is the truth.

515
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:53,630
-This action in the beginning of this year coming back from the menopause, this is actually

516
01:07:53,730 --> 01:07:59,870
a very strong impulse to the organism and she mentioned that came through

517
01:07:59,970 --> 01:08:02,470
the remedy Folliculinum.

518
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:07,870
Can you comment on this reaction?

519
01:08:07,970 --> 01:08:15,870
-I don't believe. I took Folliculinum 30 and after a week I had this or that. It's just accidental.

520
01:08:15,970 --> 01:08:21,620
I don't believe that Folliculinum actually brought that. It disturbed a little bit

521
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:23,370
the organism and it came.

522
01:08:23,470 --> 01:08:33,380
It's not a matter of Folliculinum. It's a matter of the organism is disturbed

523
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:40,620
when it's given the wrong remedy. Disturbed. Don't try to justify the reaction.

524
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:48,580
When she got Calcarea silicata, she got disturbed, the organism got disturbed. That's it.

525
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:58,720
We have to understand and to admit this, that is a mistake. Then what shall we do next?

526
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:13,630
-My opinion in menopause it's hormonal change and everyone can't stand these changes.

527
01:09:14,730 --> 01:09:22,960
It's a lot of remedies for this pathological change.

528
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:30,720
-Pathological, the change is not pathological. When the organism is not tuned absolutely

529
01:09:30,820 --> 01:09:35,460
in balance, then this change has symptoms.

530
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:40,810
-Everyone has suffered with this.
-No.

531
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:57,220
-There is the hypertension and the osteoporosis after the change of homeopathic?

532
01:09:57,320 --> 01:09:59,390
-No.

533
01:10:04,890 --> 01:10:10,240
-I mentioned you have said when I see a follow up when we have given a wrong remedy

534
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:15,720
perhaps it can be that I have to wait for the action of the remedy but the first idea

535
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:18,960
everybody has I think is to antidote.

536
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:29,450
-To antidote yes and the idea of antidoting is only when you have found the next remedy.

537
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:40,360
It's not an antidote for Calcarea is Bryonia, no. For Phosphorus the antidote is

538
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:41,580
Causticum, no.

539
01:10:43,550 --> 01:10:50,870
You disturb the organism, now the organism makes a picture, that picture it can be

540
01:10:50,970 --> 01:10:54,620
anything, it can be any remedy, that remedy will antidote.

541
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:59,120
-George I think when I have the new remedy, the best antidote is the new remedy, when

542
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:05,110
I have a clear picture but in cases I see not a clear picture, the wrong remedy is acting.

543
01:11:05,210 --> 01:11:11,940
While I wait for the clear picture, is not better to antidote for to see as best as possible

544
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:13,190
the new picture?

545
01:11:13,290 --> 01:11:23,020
-The best is to relieve the case. What she did? She took more pain killers. The best is to

546
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,870
take pain killers.

547
01:11:32,370 --> 01:11:40,120
-I hate my voice.
-She hates her voice? What is the remedy?

548
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:47,940
-I just said that she likes to stay at home, to do things in the house, care for her

549
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:50,320
grandchild and all that.

550
01:11:51,290 --> 01:11:52,940
-That is not a symptom.

551
01:11:53,040 --> 01:12:01,700
-OK, perhaps not but it's Pulsatilla.
-It is the natural quality of a woman.

552
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:18,530
I know the positive reaction to this.

553
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:29,670
Anyhow you believe something, I believe something else. We have difference of opinion.

554
01:12:36,170 --> 01:12:48,540
The American mentality has changed the world into a matriarchic society which is the

555
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:53,840
American society is governed only by women.

556
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:04,570
-So what?

557
01:13:04,670 --> 01:13:24,510
-Yes. I don't say it's governed only as Prime Minister or President, I also say that it's

558
01:13:24,610 --> 01:13:29,360
governed through the bedroom of the governors.

559
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:42,260
-I would just like to say being one of the few representatives of America here that what

560
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:48,460
George says is quite true because we have a very clear and very definite scientific basis for

561
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:54,560
what George said and that simply is that behind every great man, is a greater woman.

562
01:13:58,020 --> 01:14:07,680
-What I know as a fact, when I was in America, my student, the woman student, in parties

563
01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:16,940
they tried to change my wife into becoming American. She said, don't cook for George ever.

564
01:14:19,890 --> 01:14:22,940
Don't prepare anything for him, why you do this?

565
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:37,440
I said, wait a moment and she likes to do that, what about this?

566
01:14:43,190 --> 01:14:52,110
No, no she must not like it. A woman must do nothing, nothing.

567
01:14:53,120 --> 01:15:03,440
I said but she must do something. No, no she must not help you in any case.

568
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:15,950
I said to my wife, is it better we go away from America now? We don't stay any longer?

569
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:29,930
It was a time where we stayed long in America, becoming Americans almost. I'm just

570
01:15:30,030 --> 01:15:40,280
joking. My wife enjoys total freedom, whatever she likes, she does, this is the truth.

571
01:15:49,610 --> 01:15:57,760
I promised you to show you the gold medal which I received from the President

572
01:15:57,860 --> 01:16:04,110
of the Hungarian Democracy. Thank you.

573
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:20,710
And this is the signature of the President who presented to us. I must say we were 3 that

574
01:16:20,810 --> 01:16:30,020
were presented this very high distinction. One was a Hungarian Professor of Pediatrics

575
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:37,860
who did quite a lot for saving children with cancer.

576
01:16:47,810 --> 01:17:04,920
Tamar was... Some they doubt is it possible that the President of the Democracy gave

577
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:11,780
gold medal to George? She was present in the ceremony. I said you have to confirm it.

578
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:18,680
So here is the picture in the Parliament actually.

579
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:24,360
I have to give you the whole story.

580
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:39,740
This also got the same distinction and also Professor Dostchy from Vienna,

581
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:50,590
he is also Hungarian, born in Hungary.

582
01:17:57,090 --> 01:18:02,570
I feel this was the second distinction which I got, after the Alternative Nobel Prize,

583
01:18:02,670 --> 01:18:14,670
which has really has opened a lot of official Schools for Homeopathy.

584
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:22,570
And these things though they don't add anything to my knowledge or to me,

585
01:18:22,670 --> 01:18:34,760
they add a lot to the possibility for Homeopathy to go on to the level that belongs to,

586
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:37,110
which is the level of the Medical Schools.

587
01:18:39,610 --> 01:18:41,860
We go to the next case.

588
01:18:48,110 --> 01:18:57,140
-What potency?
-What potency you got the first time?

589
01:18:57,240 --> 01:19:00,980
-30.
-OK, get 200.
