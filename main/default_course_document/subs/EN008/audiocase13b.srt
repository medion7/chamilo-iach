1
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:28,020
What is the issue that we will dicide for what remedy we will prescribe.

2
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:37,160
It will be, whether we have enough symptomatology to support a prescription clearly.

3
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:44,320
If we have enough symptomatology to support the Graphites prescription, then we know

4
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,780
that the constitutional remedy is needed.

5
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:56,190
But if we have enough evidence to support Ignatia, then we know we're achieving the

6
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:07,420
layer upon which came after the treatment.

7
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:15,070
So the next question in the analysis of the case is, is any constitutional remedy that goes

8
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,790
through his case?

9
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:31,940
Elements of Sulphur, elements of Medorrhinum, elements of Graphites,

10
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:40,270
elements of Natrum sulphuricum they are not strong, they don't have enough information

11
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:50,130
to prescribe with certainty and have an effect on this case.

12
00:01:50,230 --> 00:02:02,760
Furthermore his case is not clear anyhow when we prescribe...

13
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:10,470
But since it is definite that the whole thing started

14
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:20,240
and from now on his health is decreasing.

15
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:37,290
I supposed we had to counteract that kind of shock and the problem is with what remedy?

16
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:41,580
-Natrum muriaticum?

17
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:53,260
-He presents certain symptoms of Natrum muriaticum, especially when he says that when

18
00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:00,840
he drinks, he feels more relaxed

19
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:14,620
Then you communicate better with your wife?

20
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:22,310
That feeling does not present a picture of Natrum muriaticum.

21
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:34,850
He spoke quite in depth, there is a closeness, he does not supposed to be bothered with

22
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:40,530
his emotions, why?

23
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:44,750
Because his emotions are very strong.

24
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:52,160
And that means what? All the lack of energy he experiences now is a repercussion on the

25
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:58,130
suppression of the emotions. Why do I say that?

26
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:12,140
Because going into spiritual questions like impression of egotism, selfishness etc.

27
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:21,290
You remember when he said when he went to Brazil he was happy but it was an ego trip;

28
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:36,780
that means he is what it is to enjoy and to feel important

29
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:46,080
he was flirting with different women he was successful , his love affairs and his

30
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:55,240
ego was stimulated according to his intellectual rhythm.

31
00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:03,620
Even that did not allow an expression of that portion in him suppressed.

32
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:12,270
So I feel that the lack of energy and the sudden lack of energy is because he has not

33
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:18,300
allowed the powerful emotions which are in him to take expression.

34
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:26,610
He will find himself when he will find an expression of these emotions.

35
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:40,480
Our remedy should be one that holds back the emotions.

36
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:55,670
Because of his constitution he is prone to philosophical thinking.

37
00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:01,610
Philosophical thinking is a natural tendency to him. He did not mentioned anything on that,

38
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:07,970
I don't know if he knows that tendency but there are certain signs in his face that show

39
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,850
philosophical thinking.

40
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:17,320
He will be a philosopher. Eventually if he goes on with his life, he will be more and more

41
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:23,130
philosophically inclined.

42
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:44,390
It could be the nose that shows that and also the eyes which are white underneath,

43
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:51,740
together with the Impression that we get when we discussed.

44
00:06:51,840 --> 00:07:02,890
So his energies have been blocked with questions about life that blocked his energy.

45
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:08,380
He is paralyzed, he does not know whether to do this or to do that. He does not know

46
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,120
whether it is right to express the emotions or not to express his emotions and how to do it.

47
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:26,130
Also he does not know how to do it. He has not learnt.

48
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:46,450
Also another point that I would say, he mentioned his liver and his spleen.

49
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:54,800
He feels maybe it's not functioning and the digestive system but here more I see an

50
00:07:54,900 --> 00:08:07,120
affection functional, dysfunction of the suprarenal gland.

51
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:14,300
I feel that this impact has been taken in the suprarenal gland and that's why there is this

52
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:25,450
sudden drop of energy. Not that there is anything there. How is your blood pressure?

53
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:37,320
-It's not too high. It's not low.

54
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:42,990
-160 - 100.

55
00:08:43,090 --> 00:09:00,590
-Oh, wait a moment. Is that what you mean? It's a bit high.

56
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:09,430
-But that's the highest.

57
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:21,940
-Diet should be very careful definitely.

58
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,870
-We are thinking of Staphysagria, is it Staphysagria?

59
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:33,920
Is it Phosphoric acid, is it Ignatia, is it Natrum muriaticum?

60
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:46,360
There are certain symptoms to support this.

61
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:50,530
Do you have a sighing at all?

62
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:56,260
-Yes.

63
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,270
-How many times you can do that in a day?

64
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:06,750
-It depends but I do it.

65
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:09,450
-Frequently?

66
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:18,810
-Once an hour or something like that.

67
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:24,450
-Can he be Sepia because also he has some symptoms of Sepia? He says he likes

68
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:31,170
dancing and he is stimulated by physical activity and also Rhus tox because the

69
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:36,860
symptoms that he presents
are symptoms of Rhus tox

70
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:50,430
-A lot of Sepia.

71
00:10:50,530 --> 00:11:00,310
-You see now the problem? How to start a case because you like to be successful.

72
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:05,270
You don't want to give Sepia and then Ignatia and then Nat mur and then god knows

73
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:16,460
what. Because it may not just do anything finally.

74
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:31,230
So you like to strike the center.

75
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:44,950
-You had some ideas?

76
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:52,870
Who likes Nat mur in this case? Nobody.

77
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:58,080
Who likes Ignatia?

78
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:03,030
Who likes Phosphoric acid?

79
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:15,600
Who likes Thuja?

80
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,650
Fruits do you like? In general?

81
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:25,550
And perspiration mostly? Where do you perspire mostly?

82
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:29,220
-On my face.

83
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,170
-Only the face?

84
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:41,560
-The whole body, it starts with the face.

85
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:59,110
-Who likes Sepia? Who likes Staphysagria?

86
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:11,820
Is anybody that has any other idea? Natrum phosphoricum?

87
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:27,660
-China, because he is over-reserved, closed person, he is sensitive, he can have this

88
00:13:27,760 --> 00:14:13,210
impulsive anger. He has these pains of the... his eyes sore too and he has a yellow

89
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,380
discoloration.

90
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:22,070
-China has a yellow discoloration, is it capital?

91
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:25,200
-No.

92
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,910
-Mercury and Natrum phosphoricum. China is italics?

93
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:31,140
-No.

94
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:51,220
-China is having some symptomatology also.

95
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,620
-Daydreaming.

96
00:14:52,720 --> 00:15:03,620
-Daydreaming yes.

97
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,820
-What is your reason for Mercury?

98
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:14,740
-He is very sensitive, that kind of sensitive that you can see in Mercury.

99
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:22,160
They do not contact others unless they feel really warm, they cannot even talk if there is

100
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:35,940
no contact.

101
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:40,620
-Would you consider Aurum?

102
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:47,310
-Aurum sure.

103
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:57,770
What is the area which you have to treat in this case?

104
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:07,160
You feel this emotional area is very calm. This is your focus of attention now.

105
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:14,730
You have to find the remedy that concentrates, not only that concentrates on the liver or

106
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:22,340
China that concentrates on the gallbladder or Sepia that concentrates on the reproductive

107
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:37,760
system but really you need a remedy to touch the emotional side, to free the flow of

108
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:48,040
energy and then to produce more acute physical symptom.

109
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:56,930
Once you will touch this case emotionally, he will develop more clear, more acute physical

110
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,400
symptomatology.

111
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:11,760
Then is the time for Sepia, for China, for Graphites, for Sulphur, for Natrum sulphuricum.

112
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:18,170
All these possibilities are there but first you have to touch that.

113
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:23,860
-I think if you give the remedy we are talking to, you are touching other symptoms.

114
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:31,420
If for example you give Lycopodium 10M or 50M. It's not only for the liver.

115
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:49,530
-You touch the mind but when I say Lycopodium is mostly given for the digestive system.

116
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:57,810
It acts more on the digestive system but it acts also on mental-emotional.

117
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:06,110
But if the main problem is emotional, you will seldom think of Lycopodium,

118
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,770
if it is purely emotional.

119
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,740
-Nitric acid?

120
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,710
-Nitric acid and Argentum nitricum.

121
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:24,220
He does not have the anxiety of Nitric acid.

122
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:36,110
What are the remedies there? We have Causticum, we have Graphites, we have

123
00:18:36,210 --> 00:19:14,120
Arum triphillum, Nitric acid and Silica.

124
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:35,660
-Can you consider Lachesis here?

125
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:38,400
-There are some points of Lachesis.

126
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,670
-The suppression of emotions.

127
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:45,870
-Yes, sure.

128
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:56,650
-I thought of Ignatia, then Sepia

129
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,120
-Do you take milk?

130
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,290
-Yes.

131
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:07,690
-The sun, how do you tolerate the sun? You can walk in the sun?

132
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:18,330
-Yes. The heat I don't like.

133
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:31,990
-Hot applications are tolerated?

134
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:41,550
-When the bath is too hot, then I think about hell or something like that

135
00:20:41,650 --> 00:21:02,500
That makes me nervous when it's too hot. I don't like when it's too hot.

136
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:25,880
-Where to start? You see how many possibilities with good reasons?

137
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:37,650
He has lost his desire for sex also which is in favor of Sepia.

138
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:48,960
As we discuss we get a clearer understanding of this case.

139
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:54,620
That is what you have to do by yourself, thinking of the case because when we think of

140
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:11,950
the case, we have different ideas. We are concreting the ideas, why this and not that?

141
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:23,560
-What you would give?

142
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:30,480
-I would give Ignatia.

143
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:46,010
-Who would give Ignatia? Who would give Nat mur?

144
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:58,410
Who would give Sepia? Who would give Phosphoric acid?

145
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:05,420
The main feelings are indifference? Can you say indifference?

146
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:24,780
-I thought about it. Something neutral, all this neutrality

147
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:55,320
-Why the crisis came on?

148
00:23:55,420 --> 00:24:05,330
He had a relationship with his wife and at a certain moment they felt that they are not

149
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:13,940
good for each other, they decided to separate but stay on the same house

150
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:19,620
-No, I changed house.

151
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:28,030
-I thought you said you stayed in the same house when you decided to separate.

152
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:34,640
-I said when we decided to divorce. It's a period we stayed together.

153
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:39,740
-For how long?

154
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,920
-One and a half year.

155
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:49,140
-During that one and a half year, she had a love affair with somebody else?

156
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,390
-I haven't seen it, I don't know.

157
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,690
-When you have seen it?

158
00:24:55,790 --> 00:25:01,820
-I don't know, it was with divorce in February and the first time I came home she was with

159
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:11,310
another one and that was a shock to me because it was always like that, periods away

160
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:40,220
and then together again. Suddenly I saw that man and I got a lot of anger that time.

161
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,400
-Was there jealousy with this anger?

162
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:54,780
-Yes jealousy.

163
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:12,560
-There are a lot of problems with a relationship after a divorce.

164
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:40,730
-What are his feelings now for his first wife? At the moment?

165
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:47,380
-I don't have feelings. It's not good. I don't want to face it. The problem is not solved.

166
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:55,060
It's not hatred. There was a lot of problems with the divorce, we had to share what we own.

167
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:18,210
I don't care about my first girls. They come to me once the year. I don't call them and if

168
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:29,720
they don't call me, they don't come. It's something that (?)

169
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:42,990
-With that girl now you have a lot of emotions?

170
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:53,840
-Yes, I really love her.

171
00:27:53,940 --> 00:28:11,350
With the first one I feel it's not working and I have so much anger.

172
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:21,960
-There is a big mortification and grief.

173
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:35,450
-Since he speaks so easily about his personal affair, would he be Nat mur or another

174
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:39,430
close remedy?

175
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:44,200
-He could, not a typical Nat mur.

176
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:51,940
The way he speaks is not a typical Nat mur but he could be.

177
00:28:52,040 --> 00:29:01,660
Also we have to understand that Nat mur of today, especially in the intellectualized

178
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:17,380
countries like America especially, they can speak about anything, they don't feel.

179
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:25,640
They can speak about their feelings, they can speak about their relationships because

180
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:31,900
they train themselves to do it.

181
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:47,080
Here in Greece we get the more pure type of Nat mur, in America you have to understand.

182
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:54,910
He is a psychiatrist also. It's in psychological treatment, psychotherapy and they say

183
00:29:55,010 --> 00:30:12,590
these things several times. So he maybe a Nat mur but sophisticated.

184
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:21,310
You see what I don't like about Nat mur is the condition which is inside, which is cut

185
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:36,030
emotionally, it is emotions strong but cut. That is Nat mur.

186
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:48,690
In his case it is Phosphoric acid and Sepia, he is indifferent.

187
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:58,360
The problem is here behind and affecting the emotions which are here but in a

188
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:04,040
subconscious way and paralyzing the emotions.

189
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:18,530
Paralyzing the emotions but some of the organs are taking the impact.

190
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:35,010
I feel as an example that more and more that this is very big.

191
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:49,720
And there is this state of depression he is in

192
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:59,780
but he is not the type, the depressed type, he is not prone to depression

193
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:07,940
but the problems is so big that has brought about a state of depression.

194
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:30,350
Therefore I would prescribe as the first remedy, Aurum.

195
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:45,990
Aurum until we free him on a certain level and then eventually

196
00:32:46,090 --> 00:33:11,920
he may need some Sepia or Nat mur or Nat sulphuricum.

197
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:17,410
But this is a deep state of depression for him, he does not appear with the tendency to

198
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:24,150
commit suicide because he is not the depressed person, he is not the type that will go into

199
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:31,310
pure depression, that will make tendency for suicide.

200
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:46,650
But it's as serious as the Aurum state.

201
00:33:46,750 --> 00:34:05,360
This deep closeness, this untouchable...The feelings are completely untouchable.

202
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:16,480
I feel that Aurum should be given first. If it does not act, then Sepia he will try.

203
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:26,060
If it does not act, then Nat mur. If it does not act, then Ignatia.

204
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:31,820
This is more or less the series of remedies.

205
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:39,880
Now if Aurum acts, he may still need Sepia as a second remedy or he may need another

206
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:45,000
remedy all together. If Aurum acts, it may change the situation.

207
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:57,290
I believe that the next stage tremendous anger will come out, it will be expressed that

208
00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:04,730
anger that was held back it will be expressed during that period of healing, irritability,

209
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:14,200
tremendous irritability and then one should go through this period and then we will search

210
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:24,080
for the next remedy.

211
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:30,240
I'm sure that the suprarenal glands have been somewhat affected, that's why your blood

212
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:42,450
pressure...This blood pressure is ...

213
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:47,830
-What about Phosphoric acid?

214
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:08,520
-I would say that the weakness is Phosphoric acid.

215
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:21,760
There will be some mind, intellectual weakness and also the state in which he would have

216
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:28,700
been, it would have been is total indifference. But he said it's not indifference.

217
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,970
It is something that does not move. Not real indifference.

218
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:48,800
This state is what we describe in Sepia situations. Sepia is very possible.

219
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:58,660
Actually in the beginning I was more Sepia and then as the case it was developing I was

220
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:09,040
seeing more and more the deepness of depression and then the events that justify this and

221
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:23,520
then I chose Aurum.

222
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:35,840
-Why did you think about Aurum?

223
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:48,170
-A few symptoms, like  better in evening is characteristic of Aurum and mostly the intensity of

224
00:37:48,270 --> 00:38:00,320
the depression and the fact of being his type, he said sometimes he is thinking about the

225
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:14,690
idea of suicide.

226
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:22,610
You were a good case because you gave us a lot of intellectual exercise.

227
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,570
What we are doing in Homeopathy in prescribing?

228
00:38:48,350 --> 00:39:00,450
We have two basic kinds of prescribing.

229
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:11,490
The one is prescribing for a layer

230
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:25,890
and the second type of prescribing is prescribing upon a layer.

231
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:30,630
What do we mean by that?

232
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:43,080
Prescribing for a layer is prescribing deep constitutionally and taking away a chronic

233
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:56,750
condition, a layer that will give the person a sense of well-being and will jump in health.

234
00:39:56,850 --> 00:40:09,830
Prescribing for a layer will have as an effect a jump in the health of an individual,

235
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:23,070
will feel not only better but another level of health.

236
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:37,550
This kind of prescribing for a layer is what we may call also a constitutional prescribing

237
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:51,170
and it is obtained by prescribing either one, two, three or a series of remedies.

238
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:57,830
That means a layer will not go away always with one remedy but maybe with a second

239
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:03,690
and a third remedy and these are cases where you prescribe one remedy constitutionally.

240
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:10,520
It does changes, then you prescribe a second one, you prescribe Apis, then you prescribe

241
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:19,500
Nat mur, where the person feels even better but finally you come with Sepia, Sepia covers

242
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:40,090
the most. So it is Apis, Nat mur, Sepia that has created the lifting of a layer in a person.

243
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:54,210
This is a desirable prescribing that it cannot be done always.

244
00:41:54,310 --> 00:42:01,380
So usually what we do in our prescribing is prescribing upon a layer.

245
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:10,970
That means there is a layer, underline a layer which is Sulphur, Calcarea and we

246
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:19,110
prescribe Rhus tox, Bryonia, Belladonna and all the time we prescribe for that individual

247
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:28,240
without touching his deeper, constitutional tendencies.

248
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:51,780
Prescribing upon a layer would mean several things.

249
00:42:51,880 --> 00:43:02,700
The first is that you cannot touch the deeper layer, unless you prescribe upon the layer.

250
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:16,930
You have a case of Sulphur constitutional but unless you give Ignatia to counteract a state

251
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:26,240
of grief in which he is in or a Staphysagria state of grief or a Causticum state of grief or a

252
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:33,680
Nat mur state of grief that was there for the last 5-6 years, you will not be able to prescribe

253
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,440
for the layer.

254
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:44,570
So you see some elements of Sulphur underneath, you go and give Sulphur but it doesn't

255
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:54,180
do anything unless you prescribe upon a state which has come about after a stress, a

256
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,350
grief or whatever it is.

257
00:43:56,450 --> 00:44:07,790
What happens in this case, this person constitutionally has this kind of graph, which is

258
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:19,340
Graphites. He is basically a Graphites patient with an underlined Sulphur to cover up a

259
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:28,020
psoric layer or you can say Nitric acid and Mercury.

260
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:33,470
This is his basic layer and now this person most of his life he does not find a homeopath,

261
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:40,210
he takes allopathic drugs, sometimes he comes into contact with a big stress and then

262
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:52,640
upon the Graphites layer is grafted an Ignatia layer.

263
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:59,380
So you see some similarities here of Graphites which still looks underneath but taking into

264
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:08,050
consideration this part, you will see Ignatia. Unless you give Ignatia, he will not answer.

265
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:18,240
The underlined Graphites state will not appear.

266
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:26,200
So here it is a remedy not born with, not constitutional but grafted upon certain

267
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:29,130
circumstances.

268
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:34,880
So a remedy can be grafted or the picture of a remedy can be grafted upon a constitution

269
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:46,600
and if that is left for years, a second graft can take place under different stresses.

270
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:57,490
So here you may have Ignatia and upon the Ignatia state it can be grafted a state of

271
00:45:57,590 --> 00:46:05,130
Phosphoric acid or another remedy.

272
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:16,020
You may need two remedies before you reach the real constitutional.

273
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:27,070
What happens is that an individual who needs Graphites, meets with a stress, sleeping on

274
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:39,330
a wet place, he gets up in the morning and he is with a lumbago or a sciatica.

275
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:56,160
He comes to you with symptoms of sciatica, which indicates a perfect case of Bryonia.

276
00:46:56,260 --> 00:47:04,190
You give Bryonia, he goes back, he is very happy, thank you.

277
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:14,080
Or if that is left, this lumbago, sciatica etc. he may develop another remedy, that means

278
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:18,320
Rhus tox and then Bryonia.

279
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:23,730
So you give Rhus tox and then Bryonia and then cure and then he goes away.

280
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:32,990
But what you are not touching the underline at all.

281
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:46,160
But what you are doing and you may be doing it for years with that individual without

282
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:51,850
understanding what really happens, now in such a case prescribing upon a layer,

283
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:58,280
the sense of well-being and jumping a level-as we call it- it will never come.

284
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:03,230
The individual is happy because you are a good prescriber and every time he comes with

285
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:11,120
a stress, he comes with Phosphoric acid because he is in a syndicate and he goes for

286
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:21,720
elections and he is humiliated, he comes back with a Phosphoric acid state.

287
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:34,080
Then you give Phosphoric acid, he is cured, thank you very much, he goes back.

288
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:48,860
Then later on he goes to India and he comes with a diarrhea etc.

289
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:58,710
All these prescribings are prescribings upon a layer, that means you prescribe correctly,

290
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:10,590
this is a correct prescribing but it won't give the chance to go deeper.

291
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:23,900
But maybe he likes to come for a deeper treatment or you may not even explain to him

292
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,850
but you must know what you are doing.

293
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:34,770
You must know that I have touched this individual on a superficial level, which is correct.

294
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:40,960
It is not incorrect, it is correct but you have not touched him deeply.

295
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:45,200
That is a big difference.

296
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:53,620
The person is satisfied, you are satisfied, it won't seem to be (?) of what is going on

297
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:57,820
without any reason.

298
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:04,770
It is this knowledge that made me yesterday going away from remedies that may be

299
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:12,850
constitutional for him and I said this is a big shock, the organism is under that stress,

300
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:22,410
under that grief, then I have to see what is indicated for that state first and then actually

301
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:31,140
thinking about going into constitutional prescribing.

302
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:39,280
What happens in our prescribing actually, that sometimes we do that and it is correct.

303
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:45,740
What you will usually, well not usually, it depends in our experience but many times even

304
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:52,150
an experienced homeopath will do, is to prescribe upon this symptomatology, which is

305
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:53,900
Graphites, which is underneath.

306
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:00,980
That pushes a little bit the case and changes the case without producing real effect.

307
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:08,620
Then because of the change we prescribe another remedy and a little bit more change, a

308
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,590
little bit more change...

309
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:14,810
You remember the case I gave you with Ranunculus bulbosus?

310
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:21,980
You think that you are doing something; actually no remedy was correct except of

311
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:28,290
Ranunculus bulbosus and that was left, was not recognized and other remedies were

312
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:36,680
prescribed further to let the person stay in the Ranunculus bulbosus state.

313
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:42,400
So what we do is we prescribe and we change symptomatology without touching deeper,

314
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:48,320
without bringing out order into the case.

315
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:53,270
Order is a great thing to realize because we have a knowledge.

316
00:51:53,370 --> 00:52:01,400
Order in this case it means that our knowledge is sufficient to recognize the harmonics,

317
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:05,210
which are appearing every time in the individual and to evaluate these harmonics and say

318
00:52:05,310 --> 00:52:14,030
this is important harmonic now, I have to treat that.

319
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:20,470
This comes with experience and cases after cases and mistakes after mistakes.

320
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:25,180
I do not say that I have not made mistakes. I have done a lot of mistakes that's why

321
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,380
But I was very responsible.

322
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:30,200
And you know why I was very responsible? Because I was practicing medicine in a

323
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:33,910
country where you are not allowed to practice Medicine unless you are a medical doctor;

324
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:43,030
So I had to be absolutely correct. I had to be very correct and I was very anxious.

325
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:50,460
That's why most probably led me to the observation and to know more.

326
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:59,420
Other medical doctors say we can kill a few and then a few more.

327
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:08,510
In certain hospitals they call it, you know when they play football and the make a goal, one

328
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:20,080
doctor says to the other who comes on duty, we have two goals, that means we score two

329
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:23,540
points, there are two persons dead.

330
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:30,290
This is the attitude in hospitals. I could not have that attitude, I could not afford it.

331
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:36,960
Therefore I had to be very careful of what I was doing.

332
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:50,730
A clarity eventually comes upon and then you recognize that this is a case where you do

333
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:56,900
not prescribe constitutionally, you have to antidote first the upper layer, what we call the

334
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,130
upper layer.

335
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:05,330
And once this is gone, then you may be dealing with that layer.

336
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:11,990
So prescribing upon a layer can be correct and can be wrong

337
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:17,920
because you may be all your life prescribe upon a layer on an individual

338
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:22,450
when he needs Bryonia, you prescribe Graphites,

339
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:26,080
when he comes to Ranunculus bulbosus, you prescribe Rhus tox,

340
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:35,260
when he comes finally to Dulcamara influenza, you prescribe Dulcamara and he is better

341
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:39,000
but back to the previous layer and you can't find it

342
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:43,690
Another layer is coming because of another epidemic and you give correct, you give

343
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:48,340
correct, you give wrong, you give correct, you give wrong, wrong, wrong, one correct

344
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:54,560
This is more or less what is going on without knowing what you are doing.

345
00:54:54,660 --> 00:55:03,140
When you prescribe a remedy, think it very seriously, decide that this the remedy, give it

346
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:11,640
and don't haphazardly go and change your remedies, give another. This is no good.

347
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:19,200
In his case I would like to comment a little bit more and then later I shall read you from the

348
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:31,550
Materia Medica I'm writing on Aurum to show you why I have decided on Aurum.

349
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:37,150
Why I didn't prescribed Ignatia?

350
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:46,250
Because Ignatia is a state which is much more mild and it is not as deep as I would see

351
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:49,650
that state in which he is.

352
00:55:49,750 --> 00:56:00,060
Ignatia in spite of appearing there somewhat, it will not touch this case.

353
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:05,930
The hysterical element of Ignatia is not there.

354
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:12,140
It is rather a deep, philosophical attitude, thinking deeper.

355
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:18,520
He thinks a lot, he didn't disclose all his thinking of course, but it is not the hysterical

356
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:26,690
element of Ignatia

357
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:34,290
Ignatia is light in spite of her hysterias, in spite of her reactions.

358
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:37,250
You say something, she answers immediately.

359
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:42,560
You do something, immediately she can react.

360
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:46,600
There is a lightness. Here there is not that lightness.

361
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:53,380
There is a deeper, solid state.

362
00:56:55,870 --> 00:57:09,180
I will read you from page 8, from Aurum just to show you.

363
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:16,430
Even Aurum is one of the main remedies with complaints from grief and rejection,

364
00:57:16,530 --> 00:57:26,410
the patient seems almost to invite isolation, by his action he isolates himself.

365
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:36,390
He has a cool, calculating manner in his emotional life.

366
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:42,760
He seems to think, well I said good morning to my wife, that's enough.

367
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:45,730
What else she needs?

368
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:55,210
He feels an intolerable pressure from any sort of emotional demand made on him.

369
00:57:55,310 --> 00:57:57,200
Do you understand?

370
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:05,900
He feels an intolerable pressure inside from demands on emotional level made on him.

371
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:15,540
The demands lead him to fits of anger and then self-reproach.

372
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:25,440
He is full of passions but seems to lack or being incapable of giving affection.

373
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:31,400
Though he has passions inside, he is unable to give affection.

374
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:44,160
On the other hand he requires a great deal of love and appreciation.

375
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:53,040
On a deeper level there is this need for affection and for love and for protection

376
00:58:53,140 --> 00:59:03,850
but it is so deep. Even here he finds it difficulty in accepting affection.

377
00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:12,280
Though in a deeper level he demands affection, he demands what he said about his

378
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:16,570
mother, the love, the breast, he wants to be safe

379
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:25,980
but even in this case he finds difficulty in accepting affection.

380
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:33,290
If his wife becomes over emotional or if her affection becomes too overt, it fills him with a

381
00:59:33,390 --> 00:59:44,670
type of repulsion. An Aurum cannot take it, repulsion.

382
00:59:44,770 --> 01:00:05,210
He seems to need a refined, almost elegant approach from the others.

383
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:11,630
Not over emotional things.

384
01:00:11,730 --> 01:00:21,190
Thus he tends to cut down all warmth from his family and the ridiculous, when that is

385
01:00:21,290 --> 01:00:25,830
expressed. Finally he becomes more and more isolated.

386
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:39,740
He looks at a distance in his relationships and finally he begins to blame himself.

387
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:44,750
He has been generous with his money but not with himself.

388
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:51,290
Then someone in his family criticizes him and calls him cold; he looks deeply into himself

389
01:00:51,390 --> 01:00:54,250
thinking he is right, it's all my fault.

390
01:00:54,350 --> 01:01:11,040
This element of not accepting affection, not being able to accept affection is very strong in

391
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:24,140
his case and depression is there and that is the type that we prescribe upon a layer now.

392
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:33,780
It is not a constitutional Aurum that you will find every little detail of Aurum but you will find

393
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:38,730
the essence of Aurum in his depression.

394
01:01:38,830 --> 01:01:45,410
Though he says I do not want to commit suicide, he says I'm flirting sometimes with the

395
01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:48,640
idea because he is not a constitutional Aurum.

396
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:55,730
I don't prescribe constitutionally Aurum, I prescribe in order to counteract the deep grief

397
01:01:55,830 --> 01:02:03,140
that came upon during that period and also Aurum is philosophical.

398
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:11,560
It is much more deeper thinker than Phosphoric acid, Ignatia, Staphysagria, etc. from

399
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:15,530
these remedies.

400
01:02:15,630 --> 01:02:25,580
So you are thinking not this, not that and then eventually, as the case unfolds, you say

401
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:30,300
that's Aurum.

402
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:53,150
In the constitutional type, when the child is Aurum, we see the high ideals

403
01:02:55,120 --> 01:03:02,030
to be the best, to shine the gold.

404
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:20,150
The Aurum people need that reassurance from others, you are the best,

405
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:23,610
they need that in order to go on.

406
01:03:23,710 --> 01:03:28,550
And as they go on with this reassurance, there comes the shock, the grief, the failure,

407
01:03:28,650 --> 01:03:40,340
whatever it is and everything is lost. Absolute darkness, it cuts down the gold all together.

408
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:51,190
Then you need to eject some gold to be shining again.

409
01:03:51,290 --> 01:04:00,760
Describing with words situations it is very difficult.

410
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:07,770
I've been thinking a lot when we are writing with Roger, you can ask him when you need,

411
01:04:07,870 --> 01:04:13,690
I will give a lecture like this, I will talk about Aurum to him, he will write it down and he will

412
01:04:13,790 --> 01:04:19,470
bring it back and half of what he writes it is misunderstanding, not this, not this, this word

413
01:04:19,570 --> 01:04:20,710
is not right.

414
01:04:20,810 --> 01:04:30,360
I mean to express the right thing is so difficult because you may have been reading

415
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:38,430
Aurum and yet not recognize that state, where he was saying almost the same words that

416
01:04:38,530 --> 01:04:43,790
I was writing.

417
01:04:43,890 --> 01:04:52,050
Here we prescribe mostly on what we call prescribing on essence, in his case.

418
01:04:52,150 --> 01:04:56,970
We have the confirmation better in the evening, open your Repertory in generalities,

419
01:04:57,070 --> 01:05:08,340
evening ameliorates and see which are the remedies that are ameliorated in the evening.

420
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:14,020
We will not go for Medorrhinum in his case.

421
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:25,560
You see how one could go on, desire for sour things, amelioration in the evening makes a

422
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:34,210
Medorrhinum case, where a Medorrhinum may be later on, it will be Sepia-Medorrhinum

423
01:05:34,310 --> 01:05:37,910
or Medorrhinum-Sepia.

424
01:05:38,010 --> 01:05:53,190
Then Medorrhinum is going to act but first this.

425
01:05:53,290 --> 01:06:01,550
There are some people who are teaching today Homeopathy

426
01:06:01,650 --> 01:06:04,050
and then what they have seen?

427
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:10,320
They have seen some cases who need Sulphur and a relapse, again Sulphur and again a

428
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:17,650
relapse and Sulphur does very good to them for almost every situation.

429
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:27,850
So they teach and they say there must be one remedy for every individual that is going to

430
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:29,830
help him right through.

431
01:06:29,930 --> 01:06:38,850
You ask them, have you found this? For how many patients of yours have you found this?

432
01:06:38,950 --> 01:06:44,020
Very few. But since they have seen that, that means every patient should have one

433
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:51,690
remedy that will cover everything...That is nonsense.

434
01:06:51,790 --> 01:07:02,260
If you try for that, you go deeper and deeper, you go to the childhood area and you give

435
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:08,910
Staphysagria, you give Ignatia, you give this and that, nothing.

436
01:07:09,010 --> 01:07:17,310
Unless we use our logic and our experience also.

437
01:07:17,410 --> 01:07:25,480
Go and find deeper in there, yes sometimes you have to do that but in particular situations

438
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:32,640
where what symptomatology appears to be now is on the childhood as well.

439
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:42,310
He is not an Aurum childhood.
Aurum came after a grief.

440
01:07:42,410 --> 01:07:45,540
That's why he is not a typical.

441
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:54,480
He will not have all the typical symptoms of Aurum.
