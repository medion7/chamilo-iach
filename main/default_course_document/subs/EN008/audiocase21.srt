1
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:42,070
-The case is male 36 years old and it concerns his memory.

2
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:50,040
Primary concerns memory, feeling of mental weakness, difficulty in memory,

3
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:56,880
concerns with being a homeopath and learning all these remedies and being able to recall them,

4
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:07,870
studying them, being in stress all my life, I'm a naturopath and the last couple of years I

5
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:17,980
have a lot of stress with finance and work and nothing seems easy,

6
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,460
nothing seems as it should be.

7
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:36,720
I had difficulty to come here, difficulty with memory that I start to write and

8
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:44,710
 I get the letters wrong, peoples names that I should know well enough and

9
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,040
call them on their name and

10
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:56,300
I feel embarrassed about that, I feel stupid about that.

11
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:12,810
The last year some lack of sexual feeling, difficulty becoming aroused and

12
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:21,000
loose erections and things like that.

13
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:37,780
-Just say what you want to say and I will put some questions.

14
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:48,270
-This is observations about myself, claustrophobia.

15
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:53,330
No matter what kind of bedroom I have, I have the sensation that I'm sitting in the floor

16
00:02:53,430 --> 00:03:00,250
and I'm going to disappear from the floor, I'm suffocating a bit.

17
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:04,750
-When do you have this feeling? By the moment you are lying in bed or

18
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:09,750
by the moment you are falling asleep?

19
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,780
-The moment that I'm in bed.

20
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:20,120
-Still while you are awake you have the impression that you are sinking through the bed?

21
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:27,940
-More that I'm attracted, maybe in the morning I can't get up again,

22
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:34,150
the sense of being towards the end.

23
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:42,450
The case we did on Sunday I felt like Sulphur, lack of will power under stress and tension,

24
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:51,780
I smoke with a pipe, the last 3-4 months I try to quit with very little will power.

25
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:57,130
The type of person that even when I'm advising other people about diet,

26
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:01,130
 sometimes I never keep my diet.

27
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:08,470
For the last six months once the day close to where my office is, I go and have black tea

28
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:21,560
and sweet roll and a fish sandwich. I feel I need it to give me a lift.

29
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:41,720
-Is anybody that does not follow with this pronunciation?

30
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:46,210
-The memory thing just keeps coming up...

31
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:24,130
The last years I also have some muscle weakness, feeling lack of muscle tone,

32
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:33,460
at the summer I can take bicycle but I can't run because

33
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,660
I just don't have the strength and the energy.

34
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:43,720
I'm a night person, I rather stay up and work late at night.

35
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:49,470
If I had choice I would study and work at night and sleep in the morning.

36
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:56,930
If I'm doing paper work for instance I get stuck until the evening hours.

37
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:14,040
Some throat weakness, congestion this area, worse in high humid weather.

38
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:20,470
I have difficulty in making changes I need to get my life going. Lack of initiative.

39
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:26,720
 Doing changes in my life.

40
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:33,960
In relationships with women I've been told that I try to remake people too much,

41
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:39,800
I think I've been giving all this helpful advice but it's not always taken that way and

42
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:49,380
generally relationships I don't feel I have a power. I feel women have a power.

43
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:55,880
In the relationships I've been in, it's usually women who left and I feel sometimes

44
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:11,220
confused and weak from that and... also a sense of lack of power.

45
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,010
-The women left you?

46
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:25,470
-Yes. Generally I feel I'm very shy, I feel it's difficult to reach out to people and

47
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:34,300
if it is a situation, maybe a class where I can talk to people and

48
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,800
I have a reason to be with people, I can do it then but in certain situations that

49
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,300
I would like to meet people,

50
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,300
I'm just in the corner, I don't do that.

51
00:07:47,400 --> 00:08:05,800
Physically the sexual energy I have some fits [?] and a little rash...

52
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:16,550
Those are my big concerns.

53
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:28,560
Remedies I had five years ago was Nux vomica high potency, I've been seeing a homeopath and

54
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:40,130
I had Sulphur, Lycopodium which it seemed that it may have working but

55
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:47,640
I had dental appointment two days later and if it was working I wasn't quite sure.

56
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:51,970
 It was repeated in high potency, it didn't do anything.

57
00:08:52,070 --> 00:09:08,070
Since then I have Ignatia and for some reason I had Baryta carbonica.

58
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:16,220
-Did you have any effect from any of these remedies?

59
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,290
-I think I may have had some effect from Lycopodium, it was antidoted,

60
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:25,050
I don't know afterwards and I didn't take it the second time it was given.

61
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,550
-Ignatia?

62
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:43,300
-I had taken Ignatia 30 about a month before that for acute stress...

63
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,550
-You took it on a higher potency as well?

64
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:59,900
-I was given in high potency, I think 1M. No noticeable effect.

65
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:10,800
I have also concern with the sexual energy and I don't know whether this is a stress in

66
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:17,300
my life worrying me down or whether it has to do with the partner relationships I had which

67
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:29,300
 is been hurtful to me and I had the feelings that it was dangerous to be involved.

68
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:40,380
I don't know which one of those it is.

69
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:50,640
-The memory, when did you first notice drop in your memory or it was always there?

70
00:10:50,740 --> 00:11:03,500
-It's been always there and it's been worse the last 3 years.

71
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:10,800
I always had a feeling that I was inefficient computer, I was not stupid but the way I did

72
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:18,550
things was not the most efficient.

73
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:26,530
I also had that suffer tendency to do what I want to do, to study what I want to study,

74
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:35,110
which is maybe the most important at the moment. That is my background.

75
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:46,390
Difficulty in conflict situations, I do not get angry with people.

76
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:53,280
Very seldom, very seldom.

77
00:11:53,380 --> 00:12:01,530
I was taught in so many classed that you have anger towards women and

78
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:13,360
I said yes I think I do but it was intellectualized. It's underneath there.

79
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:31,110
-Can you talk to us a little bit about your childhood?

80
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:45,840
-My parents were together,  my father never expressed his emotions,

81
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:50,730
there was always conflict between me and my father for things how to be done.

82
00:12:50,830 --> 00:13:04,990
He never expressed his emotions unless he blew up, he never got the things out of him.

83
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:16,900
I had some conflict also when I was in my teenage years, I would make suggestions how

84
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:27,910
things should be done and 2-3 times he would try to bit me up.

85
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:43,300
The first time it happened I felt confused and unjustly attacked,

86
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:49,050
I felt I was a good person trying to do a good thing and

87
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:54,300
I've been smashed against the wall and that was confusing

88
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,050
to me and I felt hurt.

89
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,500
-What age it was that?

90
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,460
-12-13.

91
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:16,290
-That was the first time that you had a grief or stress or

92
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:23,800
it was before that you experienced anything?

93
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:30,000
-In the third grade I experienced it when I had difficulty in mathematics and I got moved

94
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,670
from the first group to the second group.

95
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:34,920
-What age was that?

96
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:43,420
-Eight years old.

97
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:55,550
-I remember the experience of going into a state of confusion and embarrassment

98
00:14:55,650 --> 00:15:05,300
about not going properly and making mistakes and that changed me.

99
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:14,300
-Have you had any kind of psychotherapy?

100
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:20,220
-I don't believe so.

101
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:34,900
-What I'm asking is whether you had a psychotherapy session?

102
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:46,650
Or what has happened really is that you had been but for you it was not a session at all?

103
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:55,350
-When I was in the college to NY I went to a therapist trying to get valium from him but

104
00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:06,560
it was not really sessions. Valium was a very good drug for me.

105
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:16,850
They thought it was addicting and they gave me another thing.

106
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:26,810
-Have you been using drugs at all, like marihuana, these light drugs?

107
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:30,190
-No.

108
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:35,690
-Or once, twice or three times all together?

109
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:55,020
-My whole life? I did some many years ago. I did it when I was in sociality program about

110
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:01,110
three weeks and everyone was doing.

111
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,950
-For how long you took it?

112
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,690
-Three weeks.

113
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,640
-Every day?

114
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:16,450
-Yes.

115
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,940
-What you consider as your main symptom?

116
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:27,280
-Two things, the memory problem and the sexual energy.

117
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:35,030
-The sexual energy I can understand there is no much desire for sex or there is desire but

118
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:40,020
when you are in a situation you have problem?

119
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:53,610
-There is mental desire but there is no feeling.

120
00:17:53,710 --> 00:18:02,860
If I was with someone which I was very, very attracted to, it might be some but still I have

121
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:22,110
difficulty having ejaculation and I lose erection. I feel coldness.

122
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:28,790
-Before it was better?
-Yes.

123
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:37,630
-When did you have sex for the first time?
-16.

124
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:50,640
-There was a time when sexual function was good?
-Yes.

125
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:55,360
-And from one point onwards there is this blockage?

126
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,090
-Yes.

127
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:03,840
-Did you define it in your mind what it happened?

128
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,010
-I'm aware of about two years ago.

129
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:14,500
-After a particular relationship that you had?

130
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:25,510
-I can't say one particular, I don't know.

131
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:39,700
-How you are acting in a relationship? Can you describe?

132
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,760
You are over reacting emotionally or more logically?

133
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:49,510
-Too much logically.

134
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:55,020
-Since when did you realize that you are functioning with your mind?

135
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,250
It was always like that?

136
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,090
-It was always like that.

137
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:02,590
-You don't remember yourself functioning from the heart.

138
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:10,180
-I remember myself functioning from the heart but in a structured relationship there is too

139
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:20,670
much mental stuff that goes on, thinking too much and making plans and analyzing.

140
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:30,680
I've always done that but there was an emotional feeling that has been.

141
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:44,680
-There is a coldness inside concerning this area?

142
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:53,420
And sometimes this coldness becomes more?

143
00:20:53,520 --> 00:21:02,170
-Yes, there is a mental desire but there is an emotional lack, when I go close to someone

144
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:23,260
maybe it will come up and maybe I will develop it but no there is coldness.

145
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,800
-Do you have brothers, sisters?

146
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,250
-Yes one brother and two sisters.

147
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:37,500
-Good relationship with them?

148
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:42,760
-Mediocre with my brother, now it's got a little bit better and

149
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:50,760
 my sister is pretty good right now, I'm the oldest.

150
00:21:50,860 --> 00:22:02,590
-What is the opinion of others about you, what they usually tell you?

151
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:12,260
-When I think of others you mean people I have relationship with?

152
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:20,420
-A general idea what you hear about yourself in relationships, from friends?

153
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:37,920
-Too critical, too perfectionistic, loving in some ways...

154
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:58,880
-What the girlfriends have said? That you are very critical or very cold or egotistical?

155
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:06,090
-They said that I'm very critical and very selfish and I try to change them too much and

156
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:10,590
I'm not satisfied the way they are.

157
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:18,090
-Have you been cheating them sometimes?

158
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:39,940
-I don't think so. Sometimes, yes. Yes I think so.

159
00:23:47,190 --> 00:24:06,250
-What is according to your understanding his main, the most prominent as far as his

160
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:13,090
symptomatology is concerned?

161
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:22,580
-He is very hard to express.

162
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:31,670
-Very self-critical, too much.

163
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,320
-Somebody else?

164
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:44,570
-Lack of self-confidence.

165
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:50,310
-Do you think you have lack of self-confidence?

166
00:24:52,250 --> 00:25:15,600
-Yes. I mean I believe in myself deep underneath but I think so.

167
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:23,100
People sometimes tell me that also.

168
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,610
-Somebody else?

169
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:43,690
-A kind of disconnection with life and feelings that is inside.

170
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:50,680
-Too much metalized.

171
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:55,080
-Yes and with people and feelings.

172
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:59,020
-Embarrassment.

173
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:06,930
-How did you understand that? What signs led you to that?

174
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:13,660
-He is blushing too much.

175
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:26,250
-His voice changes a lot.

176
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:39,250
-What did you hear from his voice? He says I have problems with my memory,

177
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:51,080
 my memory is no good and then what I hear is another story.

178
00:26:53,440 --> 00:27:01,910
His memory may be weak, I don't know if this is his natural because somebody has

179
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:11,250
more memory than somebody else.

180
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:19,290
Because he does not remember a time when he lost his memory from that moment

181
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:22,850
onwards which made it a pathological symptom.

182
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:33,330
What correlation with the voice?

183
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:40,340
-He is angry.

184
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,110
-I felt special when he was telling about his father, embarrassment and shame and

185
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:50,930
then the stress.

186
00:27:52,270 --> 00:28:00,420
-The voice that comes out has a lot of embarrassment, distress and almost agony.

187
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:09,340
There is agony, almost anguish.

188
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:19,340
What I hear is anguish about what?

189
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:26,890
About problems that are not solved in his life.

190
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:34,640
Professionally, emotionally, he is not set and all this has created a state of

191
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:41,130
tremendous anguish.

192
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:56,010
The real thing is anguish. The memory maybe is not but the real thing is anguish.

193
00:28:56,110 --> 00:29:10,270
We call it lack of self-confidence, still he has some doubts about himself but all this has

194
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:19,770
created an anguistic thing, an anxiety thing. Too strong anxiety.

195
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:27,260
It is not an anxiety about a job or about a woman or about sex.

196
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:35,090
It is an anguish beyond anxiety.

197
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:54,590
Why there is this anxiety?

198
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:12,090
The question that he is putting, is a question of memory that demands of himself

199
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:22,670
that which is beyond his own capacity and his nature or it is a pathology?

200
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:30,260
That means that at a certain point he lost his memory. This is pathological.

201
00:30:40,800 --> 00:31:20,920
[bad sound]

202
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,930
It is a memory good for certain things. [bad sound]

203
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:36,260
The memory in him is, I believe, a natural state to have that capacity of memory,

204
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:44,520
he has not done this election. He has not decided I will remember all these things and

205
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:55,260
 these I will forger and then the memory is weak.

206
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:00,260
But maybe there is a time where you felt that you lost your memory.

207
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:09,760
-Sensory short circuit things have been going around the last couple of years.

208
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:13,340
I don't know I remember some things and other things I'm not sure.

209
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,260
If I have a patient coming a week before, I feel I should remember who that person is

210
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:28,010
but sometimes I totally forget who they are. And sometimes I make mistakes in writing.

211
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:32,040
-What exactly are the mistakes?

212
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:41,260
-I think and it was...

213
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,840
-You replacing letters?

214
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:56,300
-Yes and it sounds like the nervous system does that.

215
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:04,700
-You lost control. How is your sleep?

216
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,850
-Sleep is generally very good.

217
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:13,100
-And also in day time, in siesta?

218
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,350
-I don't have time for siesta.

219
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:21,590
-Why?
-I work in the day time.

220
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:23,850
-Here you don't have a siesta?

221
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:26,670
-I did the other day.

222
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:30,260
-For how long?
-Two hours.

223
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,770
-Did you wake up refreshed or unrefreshed?

224
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:46,510
-I did from the siesta. I wake up in the morning, I never wake up refreshed the first hour.

225
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:51,010
-In the afternoon? You slept once here?

226
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:56,600
-I think I slept twice.

227
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:00,260
-And you woke up from that sleep refreshed?

228
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:07,110
-Yes I think so.

229
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:12,010
-The position that you sleep is steady?

230
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:16,260
-Right and left sides. Not back.

231
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:22,550
-Not in the abdomen.

232
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:42,060
Give us an idea of what you think about yourself, what kind of person you are?

233
00:34:47,660 --> 00:35:05,330
-It's embarrassing to talk about myself.

234
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:11,250
-Do you have a tendency to cry? Do you cry easily?

235
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:12,730
-No.

236
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:28,230
-Is it that tears may come up to the eyes and they don't just come out or no tears?

237
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:35,560
-It comes seldom and they are repressed when they come.

238
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:46,420
I went through an est training about 4 years ago and

239
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,660
they have something I would get up on stage and I did cry there...

240
00:35:51,090 --> 00:36:05,080
I cried a couple of times when a relationship broke up.

241
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:09,860
-What is your reaction to weather?

242
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:23,010
-I don't like the hot, humid weather. That's the most.

243
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:31,700
-Do you like being in the sun?

244
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:37,180
-Yes I do it here.

245
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:49,520
-For how long, for half an hour, an hour or two hours?

246
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:56,110
-Half an hour, one hour.

247
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:59,850
-Are you bothered by the sun?

248
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:19,690
-No, I don't think I am but when I'm for a couple of hours I get heat exhausted.

249
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:23,180
-...The feet are usually normal or very cold, very hot?

250
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:31,440
-They are normal. That's my feeling.

251
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:40,310
-Excessive perspiration?
-No.

252
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:44,060
-Other perspiration...

253
00:37:44,160 --> 00:38:00,380
-I perspire excessive mostly in the axilla.

254
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:05,110
Thirsty.

255
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:09,900
-Cold water or not very cold?

256
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,230
-Not very cold.

257
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:22,070
-What other do you like? You like alcohol?

258
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:25,150
-I kind of had a problem with alcohol.

259
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:27,230
-You drink in order to relax?

260
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:36,810
-Yes before I came to Greece I've been drinking for years.

261
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:43,310
-You had some problems with drinking before?

262
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:44,650
-Yes.

263
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:47,850
-Beer or wine?

264
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:52,320
-Mostly strong beer.

265
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,400
-That seemed to relax you?

266
00:38:55,500 --> 00:39:22,780
-Yes...[bad sound]

267
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:53,530
And also if I drink a lot I will have hangovers.

268
00:39:53,630 --> 00:40:02,720
-Do you have any craving for food?

269
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:12,300
-No, I don't have craving for food, if I had myself go I would drink coca cola and potato chips...

270
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:19,510
so  salt and sweet. I don't particularly like fat.

271
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:25,970
-Do you have an aversion to fat?

272
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:33,730
-I think so. We have stuff with meat.

273
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:34,970
-You are vegetarian?

274
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:38,980
-I tried to be but no.

275
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:54,720
-How much salt do you take? Did you ever in your life had a craving for salt?

276
00:40:54,820 --> 00:41:02,220
-I like salt but I don't have craving for it.

277
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:06,600
-You like salt when it's more salty than usual, like potato chips.

278
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:10,600
-That kind of stuff.

279
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:15,840
-Did you ever take salt and put extra salt in your food?

280
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:20,590
-If there is no salt I do it, in French fries I put salt on it.

281
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:41,950
-I like spicy food, I like vegetables, carrots, garlic.

282
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:55,530
Also using tobacco to relax stress started to be too much and I started smoking again.

283
00:41:55,630 --> 00:42:12,290
I'm doing it because of habit, not of big desire sometimes. I'm upset about that.

284
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:15,040
-Are you anxious about your future?

285
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:19,040
-Yes.

286
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:23,490
-What is your greatest anxiety at the moment?

287
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:33,290
-My greatest anxiety is my health practice to become successful and work well,

288
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:42,790
which represents a carrier success.

289
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:54,410
Second from that to develop a relationship again. I'd like to marry.

290
00:42:54,510 --> 00:43:05,910
-Do you sigh sometimes?
-Yes.

291
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:13,840
I don't know if it's an emotional fatigue sighing but yes I do.

292
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:27,090
-He has been doing this now?
-Yes.

293
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:34,340
-You have noticed that you have been doing that in the day?

294
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:42,590
-I know it's three times the day and it's a definite sighing.

295
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:50,600
-Do you ever talk to yourself?

296
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:59,950
-No. I'm driving and I talk to the other cars and do funny things but

297
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:02,950
not to myself very much.

298
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:09,940
-Do you have any kind of fear?

299
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:22,780
-Just a claustrophobia, a feeling of suffocation.

300
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:31,790
Fear of lack of memory and fear of lack of money.

301
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:46,120
That's a big issue in my family, they talk about money.

302
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,610
-It's a big fear with you?

303
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:53,860
-Yes, it's also in my family, it's like a sickness almost, we are talking about it too much

304
00:44:53,960 --> 00:45:06,200
we are concerned about it, I also have fear of high places, a cliff on the ocean.

305
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:13,950
I want to jump, it's not committing suicide, it's jumping I want to merge, jumping in the

306
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:23,320
water in the sense of merging.

307
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:40,820
-Do you have any problems with time... growth?

308
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:45,820
-I don't know.

309
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:02,360
I do agree with you, it's anguish.

310
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:08,410
The last couple of years I feel is a good description of my life, yes.

311
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:19,240
-No inner calm.

312
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:26,590
-Very little.

313
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:43,740
-I was given Calcarea and Chilli also.

314
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:07,740
-Do you have anxiety about your health?

315
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:19,880
-About the muscular weakness and about the sexual energy mainly.

316
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:26,380
I know I have a weakness in the throat.

317
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:33,340
-You get colds easily? That's what you mean?

318
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:53,330
-Yes if I smoke a pipe I get irritation in the throat. If I smoke heavily it's not good for me.

319
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:57,090
-How much fish you take?

320
00:47:57,190 --> 00:48:07,090
-I like fish.

321
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:25,580
-If I have weakness in my eyes?

322
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:34,940
-No weakness in the eyelids.

323
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:49,640
-More a feeling that I'm not able to spot things, like the muscles are losing tone or

324
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:53,630
losing capability.

325
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:58,960
-What is the problem with your eyes?

326
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:06,720
-I have stigmatism.

327
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:12,250
-Strong stigmatism?

328
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:21,820
-Yes and strong myopia.

329
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:37,070
I have a tense towards lower back and sciatic problems.

330
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:38,970
-Which side?

331
00:49:39,070 --> 00:50:01,780
-Right. If I do something real strenuous like driving a car for many hours, I can't go out.

332
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:09,620
I also have stiffness in the fixation over the neck which doesn't bother me all the time.

333
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:20,120
I'm not thinking of them right now but when I'm thinking of them they are bothering me.

334
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:24,650
-What was the question?

335
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:34,120
-Has he ever become very angry?

336
00:50:36,550 --> 00:50:41,950
-A kind of lose control?

337
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:59,450
-No, I know when I'm out of control and I want to do something which is inside.

338
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:13,320
Destroy people, buildings.

339
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:21,820
-Do you shout?

340
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:33,540
-I usually shout and I want to hit people, I don't usually.

341
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:52,040
And I still have this feeling of not being able... inside me. I do not throw things.

342
00:51:52,140 --> 00:52:00,870
-Justice is an important issue for you?

343
00:52:07,410 --> 00:52:16,530
-How many times you underline this information?

344
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:32,210
-In my mind it's only... I think so yes.

345
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:44,870
-How do you feel about your patients?

346
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:56,870
-About my patients I really like to get well and I feel that I help them and

347
00:52:56,970 --> 00:53:12,860
it's probably about 20% which I don't appreciate and they don't appreciate me and

348
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:18,190
sometimes I just have difficulty with them.

349
00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:23,780
-And emotionally as a healer?

350
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:41,560
-Emotionally as a healer I can put that aside...

351
00:53:43,670 --> 00:54:07,120
-Do you feel a patient is there to attack you, to challenge your love or confidence?

352
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:12,120
-At a certain percentage yes I do.

353
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:24,370
-With all that is going on, do you feel inside that this is resolvable?

354
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:34,620
-I have my doubts. I'm a doctor two days a week, a farmer two days a week,

355
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:39,610
a businessman two days a week.

356
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:41,540
And that is a symptom of feeling somewhat overwhelmed.
