1
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,740
-The patient adds some information.

2
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,030
-When I tried once to smoke hashish, all the time I didn't want to, everybody did for 3

3
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:43,780
years and I didn't want, I resent it and then when I tried it once I had cramps and vomiting

4
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:50,370
and then I went into coma. And only lemon, after a few hours they put lemon, they give

5
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:55,120
me to drink lemon and lemon on my face and it antidoted it.

6
00:00:55,220 --> 00:01:02,610
-After a few hours? How you take hashish, you chew it or smoke?

7
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,970
-No, one puff.

8
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,760
-Also alcohol aggravates her.

9
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:30,170
Now I want to ask you a question. Do you know why I did not say anything while taking

10
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,260
her case?

11
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:46,910
Second question. If she is good as a prover for homeopathic remedy?

12
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,090
-Yes.

13
00:01:49,600 --> 00:02:10,650
-Yes absolutely. Will you being in charge of a proving, will you put her on the team for provings?

14
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,260
-No.
-Of course.

15
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:26,750
-Who says no? Who says yes? Equal but most of the people can not decide.

16
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,510
-Can you repeat the question?

17
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:39,700
-If you are the chief of a proving, knowing what you know about her because you took

18
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:47,200
her case, will you consider her a prover? Will you take her for proving?

19
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:53,060
-No.
-She is a good prover..

20
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,960
-She is a good prover, would you take her for a proving?

21
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:11,200
Who will take her for a proving? Who will not take her for a proving. Now you understood

22
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:22,980
more the question. You have to take precautions if you take her to the proving. If she says with 1 puff

23
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:33,500
of hashish she went into coma, you better be careful what you are going to give her.

24
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:55,540
They did a proving in Israel and she was regulator of the provings, she did not take the

25
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,330
remedy but she did developed the symptoms.

26
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:21,210
She developed some symptoms, it does not mean she developed the symptoms of a

27
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:33,450
remedy because her mind is so powerful that can play tricks with her. If somebody

28
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:41,210
decides that it is not good for me to be introvert and it is good to be an extrovert and she

29
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:54,210
became an extrovert actually as we see, this is amazing. It says a power of the mind over

30
00:04:54,310 --> 00:05:01,960
the body, she says I'm not going to be sensitive anymore, I'm not going to take

31
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:13,550
everything, can you do it? Who can do the same thing? Let me see your hands? Nobody.

32
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:21,140
The other way around is easy, everybody can do it, without his will of course.

33
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:31,800
So you see how exceptional you are. You are the only one that your mind can influence

34
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:44,010
your body to such a degree. I have seen it a few times. I've seen it in a case of a little girl

35
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:57,540
let us say, 11 when she started developing her breast and men started looking at her,

36
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:12,600
she got such uneasiness that she stopped her development. She stopped the pituitary

37
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:22,360
gland from producing the normal hormones for growing, she stayed small, the breast

38
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:30,520
stayed as when she was 11 but she was much ahead of her class mates in her breast

39
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:36,030
developing. She stopped it right there.

40
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:49,180
And I have seen it again, this was a case of Baryta carbonica, where she was very

41
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:59,180
intelligent. It doesn't matter, still she had Baryta carbonica and she was helped

42
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:13,450
enormously and I saw it once again with a woman who stopped her desire for sex.

43
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:24,350
Stopped completely that, I don't remember the incident and she developed male

44
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:31,350
hormones to the extend that she lost all her hair. The male hormones were very high in

45
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:58,510
her blood, what was the remedy prescribed? Sepia. No. She had sexual desire which

46
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:14,510
she did not like, Sepia does not have that. Platina? Whenever I have treated a Platina

47
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:23,520
and took away the extra desire for sex that Platina usually has, they came back and they

48
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:31,100
complained, where is my desire? I have lost my desire? Has anything to do with your medicine? No.

49
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:50,430
Then of course they decide that, that is life, you can not enjoy all the time and then of

50
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:59,080
course the headaches are also gone and ... In her case will be the opposite.

51
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,410
She will soon have problems.

52
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:26,240
It is a normalization of the hormonal system and as we said in Platina cases you may go

53
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:30,950
to the opposite where you have the opposite and then you have the other symptom.

54
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:43,150
But she will have the normal desire which she is missing at the moment.

55
00:09:46,650 --> 00:10:04,390
Pulsatilla, no. Lachesis, no. I took ailments from suppressed sexual desire. Conium.

56
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:15,400
And then she developed her hair again, her hair started growing.

57
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:28,760
The first thing we have to think about this case after we hear such a story is the potency

58
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:37,760
question. The potency question is very serious when you deal with such a case. So what

59
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:45,010
you do? Whatever is the remedy that you decide, you give rather a low potency that

60
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:56,750
means from 30 downwards, either 12 or 18 or at the most 30 if you are almost sure that

61
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:05,260
this is the remedy. Then see the reaction and then maybe you go higher but such a

62
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:14,760
sensitive individuals, see what we say sensitive individuals, proving every remedy, this is

63
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:27,760
actually a model. Therefore you have to pay attention to such sensitivities very much

64
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,330
otherwise you are going to have some problems.

65
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:54,090
So we settle this and then we go to the idea of the remedy, what is the uppermost remedy for her?

66
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:14,970
When you go to the idea of the miasms, in her case also it is clear that the uppermost

67
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:20,340
miasm which is expressing itself it is what?

68
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,320
-Sycosis.

69
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:29,470
-It is Sycosis. Now whether it's a Medorrhinum or whether it's another remedy, it has no

70
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:46,730
much meaning but the explosive, she is an explosive type, she is full of energy. I believe

71
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:53,330
she reacted much less than naturally, she is even more...

72
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:10,820
What is interested she has a defense mechanism that if it is touched a little bit, it reacts.

73
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:28,220
I can say something and immediately she can cry. Before I was something about you and

74
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:34,320
I couldn't believe, I passed my eyes and she was ready to cry again. What I was saying?

75
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:35,860
-About the mind.

76
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:50,750
-Yes and she got it. The moment I said she is the only one in the class that she can do

77
00:13:50,850 --> 00:14:11,210
that, you see tears. It's OK don't cry. So you have to take into consideration and don't do

78
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:27,880
aggressive things with her, though she looks very strong, solid. It is interesting she looks

79
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:43,630
so solid and yet so sensitive, you think this is a typical Calcarea carbonica and then you

80
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:50,730
start doubting, are you feeling hot or cold? Hot, hot, so bye, bye.

81
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:14,380
And then you are thinking of Pulsatilla, crying and all that, I started with what you like

82
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:26,470
thinking of the idea of Pulsatilla fat but I didn't want to make it clear from the beginning.

83
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:44,410
She said, meat with fat, more fat than meat. And then she went on to the idea of ...

84
00:15:50,580 --> 00:16:01,480
As the interview was progressing she went and talked about, she said certain things

85
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:07,980
which are very characteristic of Lachesis because immediately she came up with sea

86
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:16,640
food, she said desire for sea food so strong, that's why she was given Lachesis one time

87
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:25,900
and sleeping on the right side absolutely clear, sleeping on the right side, eating seafood,

88
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,990
choking. Is the choking of Lachesis?

89
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:40,240
She says, she hates the clothing.

90
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:43,490
-Only like this I go.

91
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:53,010
-Even in the winter she goes like this. She cannot have anything here. In your waist?

92
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:14,250
So strong symptoms for Lachesis and then of course she said, I'm very loquacious during

93
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:22,600
menses and you like that and you say, now this is a case of Lachesis, we go on higher potency.

94
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:42,910
She says correctly, the loquacity is not only the first day, it's during menses. That means

95
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:48,260
she is not relieved with the first flow which is Lachesis, which is correct.

96
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:20,910
He puts all these in the repertorization. You look actually if you want to do proper job, you

97
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:28,660
have actually to work with the symptoms and then as you go along you look in the

98
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:35,150
Repertory for the interesting symptoms or you put them in the computer and let the

99
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:44,400
computer an idea. It's no good to write 24 symptoms and then go and look in the

100
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:52,150
Repertory. This is not good. The good thing is to look in the Repertory as you go along

101
00:18:52,250 --> 00:19:00,000
with the case. Here it says, Nux vomica, Nat mur, Lachesis, Pulsatilla, Lycopodium,

102
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:06,100
Causticum, Nat carbo and Calc carbo, where I cannot make a decision.

103
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:34,020
What other remedy, she was taking about another remedy. Medorrhinum.

104
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:43,670
As she was talking most probably she herself realized that she was talking about

105
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:46,670
Medorrhinum, correct?
-Yes.

106
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:49,560
-When did you perceive the idea that maybe you are Medorrhinum?

107
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:54,420
-When I told you about the Arg-n. and then you asked me about my stomach and I

108
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:59,220
already thought about Med. long time ago.

109
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:10,270
-You thought about Med. long time ago. This is very important because then you have

110
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:17,000
to suspect, is she giving me Med. because she knows what she is giving or she is

111
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:23,290
giving the right information?
-No.

112
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:28,650
-I'm just teaching, I don't say you gave on purpose Medorrhinum.

113
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:39,660
I remember a case in the Center where we had the books outside and people would

114
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:45,350
read, she comes inside one case and she gives a perfect case of Rhus tox.

115
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:55,600
The doctor very happy, Rhus tox go. She comes back after a month, no effect, nothing.

116
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:05,740
What happens? She says, I don't understand because when I read the remedy outside

117
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:15,000
while waiting, I had all the symptoms of Rhus tox. While waiting, read Rhus tox, went into

118
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:20,680
the doctor, gave very clear symptoms of Rhus tox, the doctor prescribed.

119
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:30,980
Why this is happens? This is something very, very interesting. They say I'm not going to be influenced,

120
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:37,990
tell me the remedy or something like that, they get it. The moment that something is written down

121
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:44,330
and the other person reads it, he says I have this, I have that.

122
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:51,080
I've done it as an experiment. I said OK read this, how many people have it? And you

123
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:57,330
see you read Nux vomica half of the class, you read Causticum half of the class, you

124
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:00,850
read Pulsatilla half of the class, but how is that possible?

125
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:11,680
Really I have it and they believe they have it. No, this is not the homeopathic case.

126
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,330
The homeopathic case is really to see whether she comes forward with the symptom, when

127
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:24,440
she gives out a symptom, then you grasp it. You say this is a good symptom, bring it here.

128
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:34,510
What is a good symptom for her? One symptom which no one can dispute?

129
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,520
-Loquacity.
-No.

130
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,230
-Green fruits, unripe fruits.

131
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:06,480
-Even that, no. That she is hot, nobody can dispute that. It's a warm person.

132
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:20,550
She gives examples in winter, I dress like this and you get a symptom which you can

133
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:29,370
not say, maybe this, maybe not, she is hot.
Another?

134
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,210
-Sensitive.
-Yes but sensitive is general.

135
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:46,800
-Weeping?
-Yes sure, she weeps easily, there is no question.

136
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,790
-Ice cold perspiration.

137
00:23:53,290 --> 00:24:19,210
-Ice cold perspiration is a peculiar, too many remedies? Perspiration cold head? Did you find this?

138
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:32,960
-From the head is cold and then it goes all over the body.

139
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:46,110
-It goes all over the body. Calcarea, Hepar, Lobelia, Nux vomica, Phosphorus and

140
00:24:46,210 --> 00:25:00,350
Veratrum. Can you tell me if there are any additions here? 16 remedies. Which are the

141
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:12,460
additions? Calcarea, Tuberculinum...

142
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:22,690
-Only Carbo Vegetabilis is from Materia Medica and Tuberculinum.

143
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,610
-Only these two, Carbo vegetab and Tuberculinum.

144
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,690
-My father had tuberculosis.

145
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:59,780
-Her father had tuberculosis, according to the pathology of her father what is the remedy?

146
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:17,920
-Medorrhinum. Because in young age he started having a lot of heart problems, heart emphracts etc.

147
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:24,670
that points to the idea of sycosis and most probably to the idea of Medorrhinum.

148
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:34,740
So Medorrhinum maybe is running through together with Turbeculosis and maybe she

149
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:46,590
has a peculiar mixture of sycosis with tuberculosis with psora and most probably

150
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:54,850
underneath there is some syphilis. Why do we say that? Because her brother has been

151
00:26:54,950 --> 00:27:08,390
in this. Most probably we have a complex miasmatic condition with her and that is why

152
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:19,130
we have to go step by step and very carefully and we don't jump quickly to one remedy

153
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,740
after another remedy.

154
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:37,190
Another symptom?
-Desires fat.

155
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:42,680
-Yes there is no question about that, she made it very clear.

156
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:55,430
-Aggravation by the afternoon sleep.

157
00:27:56,270 --> 00:28:09,000
-Aggravation by the afternoon sleep also is very strong. So actually when you repertorize

158
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:18,750
her case, you put these symptoms first. We talked about 5 symptoms. These 5 symptoms

159
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:26,350
you go and repertorize them and see what comes through these 5 good symptoms.

160
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:37,360
Can you open another case of repertorization and put these 5 symptoms?

161
00:28:46,850 --> 00:29:27,500
Worse warm, desires fat, perspiration cold head, weeping easily,

162
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:59,550
worse afternoon sleep, sleep right side.

163
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:20,740
-Yes, I will put here 3 times, 4 times, 2 times, between 2 and 3 times, 1 time, between 2

164
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,080
and 3 times.

165
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:30,490
-I have a question about one of the rubrics for perspiration cold on the head.

166
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:35,150
Since it starts on the head and goes over the body, wouldn't be better to use perspiration

167
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:39,390
cold in the generalities than perspiration cold in the head?

168
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:46,900
-You can use that but we saw that they were 300 remedies and too many remedies and

169
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,150
we use the specific symptom which she has.

170
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:55,910
-I would be afraid there that I would miss a remedy because it was...

171
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:58,410
-Too few.
-Yes.

172
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:05,410
-We have been added some more.
-Open air also.

173
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:19,260
-Yes better open air, desire for open air. 2 times.

174
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:32,110
Do you yourself see any other symptom which you would like to see written here?

175
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:49,020
-Sensitive to medicine?
-Not really. No, in this stage of repertorization.

176
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:54,770
-Cold nasal discharge?
-Yes you can take this.

177
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,020
-Aversion water?

178
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:30,860
-Yes and there is another one which is aversion to water 3 times. Her symptoms she

179
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:40,110
present them in a strong way, right? That's why we intend to underline quite a lot in

180
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:41,720
her case the symptoms 3 times.

181
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:54,530
But now what you can decide is, for instance, you look when you take certain symptoms

182
00:32:54,630 --> 00:33:02,030
you take 4-5 symptoms, you look what it comes, you add another one, see what comes

183
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:07,790
next, you add another one, see what comes. Can you do this for the class?

184
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:16,000
This is how you get ideas for the repertorization. When I used to take a case, I did not

185
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:25,200
have computers, there was a big pause, the patient was sitting there and I was looking

186
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:37,700
through and there was always some doctors next to me and sometimes they felt

187
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:45,940
perplexed. There was a big pause there, waiting, what are we doing and we are doctors

188
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:54,050
here doing nothing, looking at the books, studying now in front of the patient, the case?

189
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:11,440
They felt perplexed and some of them told me. I said it is much better if you do this and

190
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:15,800
the patient feels whatever he likes than give him the wrong remedy.

191
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:25,950
Because you don't want to look that you don't know, you say take the remedy.

192
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:34,690
Never do that, never mind what the patient will think about you. If it a patient who does

193
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:41,550
not understand it is better to send him away from Homeopathy. You don't need patients.

194
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:47,440
You need to do your work properly, so it does not matter what he thinks.

195
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:52,690
Many times they will discuss, a patient will say to a friend who sent them, they say he

196
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:59,940
was looking in my case he was looking to learn at the moment I was there. This is very

197
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:08,190
good because I want to do my job properly. Most of the people I will tell, I have to study

198
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:14,690
your case now, I have to study, wait. They felt very happy, why? Because I was

199
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:22,520
straight forward with them. I'm studying your case now, you wait. I open the books

200
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:32,050
take my time, study the case. If I give the right remedy, then they appreciate.

201
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:40,850
He is very good, you go to him. But if you want to present yourself as knowing

202
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:52,610
everything then eventually your clientele will go down, so you have every time a good

203
00:35:52,710 --> 00:36:00,610
symptom looked in the Repertory to get ideas. This is what I'm saying here.

204
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:09,460
Staphysagria, Pulsatilla, you put all 8 symptoms? OK.

205
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:22,690
Staphysagria is interesting, why? Staphysagria has strong aversion to water and also

206
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:32,110
we put strongly the after sleep aggravates which Staphysagria also has very strongly.

207
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:47,090
So the system says, you have put and it gave me two keynotes of this particular remedy

208
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:54,510
strongly; therefore I would suggest Staphysagria and then Pulsatilla comes second.

209
00:36:54,610 --> 00:37:11,570
Pulsatilla has 5 out of 8 and weeping easily, 3-3 and warm aggravates 4-3. Aversion to

210
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:22,650
water etc and then the third remedy, which is the third remedy? Causticum. What about sweets?

211
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:40,140
-She likes sweets, desire for open air and then Nat mur etc. Let me see Opium.

212
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:58,720
I give her Opium. Do you sleep good? Sound sleep, do you snore?

213
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:02,710
-Yes.
-Very loudly?

214
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:05,070
-Yes, she says yes.

215
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:26,060
-If we confirm Opium, we give Opium. Who says no for Opium. I also doubt it.

216
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:38,710
-A lot of sympathy for people, I cry.

217
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:48,960
-You cry if they suffer. Put sympathy, how you will underline this symptom yourself?

218
00:38:49,060 --> 00:39:12,300
-3 or 4. With a cripple in the street I can cry. If somebody is mongol, even with a kid will

219
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:19,710
tell a story that it got offended I cry. With everybody.

220
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:29,150
-You sympathize with everybody who is suffering, so this element is very strong, put 3.

221
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:41,350
As she gives this, our mind goes immediately to Phosphorus. You enter one symptom

222
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:47,100
and you see, previously where was Phosphorus? Down but then suddenly comes with a

223
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:57,600
strong symptom, of course we think of Phos, of Caust, the same. Pulsatilla has gone a

224
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,210
little bit down.

225
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:22,770
Phosphorus is very thirsty yes. Put thirstless, give me this symptom, open your repertories

226
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:27,120
and see this symptom thirst less.

227
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:57,020
We see here what are the remedies, Antimonium, Apis, China... I just want to show you

228
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:08,020
the original thirstless, Phosphorus is there? It must be there. I just want to show you that

229
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:16,690
sometimes you may have a Phosphorus which is thirst less, this does not exclude

230
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:26,250
because other things being in favor, the thirstlessness may not exclude Phosphorus.

231
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:47,740
-What about the block in the ears?
-It's a local symptom which is not important.

232
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:52,350
-I have a question to the patient. Is it OK?
-Yes put the question.

233
00:41:52,450 --> 00:42:00,000
-It's about this peculiar symptom you had, the freezing cold mucus, was it from the nose

234
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,840
or from the throat?
-No from the throat.

235
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:05,340
-If you look throat mucus cool, one remedy.
-Which one?

236
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,700
-Phosphorus.

237
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:29,950
-Can you tell me who has added this? Original Kent? Me?

238
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:46,620
-Vithoulkas!
-Desire company, I can't be alone, I need people.

239
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:55,110
-She is never tired from company, she enjoys company.

240
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:13,190
-Now the fact that she wants company to elucidate and to find out why really she needs company?

241
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:28,850
-Yes I know. I like company when I am with myself I'm thinking too deeply about the

242
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:36,680
problems of the world, I feel I can get depressed, so I don't want to go into it. I prefer to

243
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:46,780
be maybe to the surface of things but it keeps me from going deep into myself.

244
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:53,190
-The rubric offended easily, if you want to have that with, do you want it?

245
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:05,170
-Yes we can have this rubric. Mucus cool, add this.

246
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:16,160
She took us from the idea of Lachesis to Pulsatilla, to Medorrhinum and now she takes

247
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:20,840
us over to the idea of Phosphorus.

248
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:27,590
-I wonder why we don't talk about Carcinosin? Why don't we talk about that?

249
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:33,900
-Why? What symptoms of Carcinosin she has?
-She has a lot.

250
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:36,350
-She likes animals.

251
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:51,960
-Forget it, who likes animals? Look, all the class. Wait a moment, to take it as a symptom

252
00:44:52,060 --> 00:45:02,790
it has to be pathology. The others must say, she collects all the animals, the house is full

253
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:07,650
of dogs, you enter the house and dogs and cats are sitting all over the place.

254
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:11,640
-Maybe she is like that.

255
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:28,770
-Still I doubt. I tell you why I doubt, she needs company and she needs to give her love

256
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:35,060
and affection and if she does not have some human being to do it, then she finds an

257
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,430
animal and then take some also.

258
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:49,890
Since we are in the question of Phosphorus, we have to ask more questions about the

259
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:58,150
Phosphorus. We ask about fear. We said, do you have any fears? She did not mention

260
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:08,150
any fear of Phosphorus. She did not say about thunderstorms especially, she is not afraid
of the dark.

261
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:15,990
-As a kid maybe, when I have to walk on a very dark alley here, I will be afraid.

262
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:23,320
Maybe not in Alonissos but in Athens yes and to walk alone in a dark place, I would think

263
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:27,820
that somebody is behind me and I will be afraid from robbers and from somebody will kill

264
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,170
me, I will be.

265
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:31,870
-Keep this.

266
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:51,340
-Yes I have problem with memory. I search sometimes for a word and it wouldn't come.

267
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:59,490
I have like if I'm studying about a remedy, I remember it very nicely and then the next day

268
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:05,740
it's mixed with the rest of the remedies and it bothers me a lot because I used to have a

269
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:12,910
very good memory. There is a time where I say to my husband can you bring me this?

270
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,970
And he says, say the word and I couldn't get the word.

271
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:25,070
-How many times?
-It was for about 2 years.

272
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:30,660
-Every day you had this problem?
-Yes, all the time.

273
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,150
-And then it went away?

274
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:43,740
-It still is but not often, the words go away, I'm looking for certain word, even a name.

275
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:48,120
-What would you like to ask concerning Phosphorus?

276
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,170
-Anxiety about health?

277
00:47:54,200 --> 00:48:05,320
-Yes very, especially for my kids, mine also but then I take it out of my head not to think

278
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:06,670
about it, if I think about it yes.

279
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:17,900
-You had it. So either she is Pulsatilla with desire fat or she is a Phosphorus with

280
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,910
aversion to water. You chose.

281
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:29,420
-It's more aversion to water than desire fat.
-She likes to be Phosphorus.

282
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:40,320
-I can live without fat but I can't stand water, before I put water in my mouth I feel sick.

283
00:48:40,420 --> 00:49:01,660
-Aversion to water, main remedies? Nux vomica, Staphysagria, Stramonium and the

284
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:14,410
Pulsatilla is on the second degree and then Staphysagria which also we are playing with

285
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:24,510
the idea. He is sure she is a Staphysagria.

286
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:31,240
-I have a question. She mentioned several times in different parts of the body a sharp

287
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:37,900
pain like a hard knife cutting, would you use that, you would be able to use it under a generality?

288
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:47,010
-You have too many symptoms already, so to go and use a local symptom...

289
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:55,770
Like for instance a stitching pain here, this will not because you have very strong general

290
00:49:55,870 --> 00:50:00,510
symptoms on which you have to go by.

291
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:04,260
-But she mentioned several times with different parts of the body. It was the back...

292
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:13,160
-It doesn't matter, what you will say stitching pain or what? If you go to generalities and

293
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:20,450
you see stitching pain in generalities, there are a lot of remedies, you don't differentiate.

294
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:24,790
It is useless for differentiation.

295
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:32,860
-She mentioned early in the interview that she has an aggravation from coffee.

296
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,470
-Aggravation from coffee?

297
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:44,780
-I like coffee but I have aggravation from coffee. Afterwards I feel nausea.

298
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:51,870
-Again that is a symptom you have to take with care because she is sensitive to any

299
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:59,960
stimulants, she was stimulated a little bit with the hashish and she went off.

300
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:09,110
-We're talking about desires and aversions, she mentioned onions, I would like to ask

301
00:51:09,210 --> 00:51:12,360
her how strong is the aversion to onions?

302
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:16,530
-Aversion to onions or worse from onions?

303
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:22,130
-When I eat onions, I like onions, I just feel afterwards it comes up.

304
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:32,780
-A little bit worse from onions, this is in favor of Pulsatilla. Then argue with what she says

305
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:39,780
now. Sometimes there is an expression "I hate it" but she means it makes my stomach so

306
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:45,460
upset but she may like it.

307
00:51:54,470 --> 00:52:05,840
-I was thinking in the realms of Belladonna because she is thirstless and she is plethoric

308
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:11,700
and red and the sudden symptoms and the hemorrhage.

309
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:20,110
-Wait a moment, did you have hemorrhages? This is a good question.

310
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:20,970
-Can you put the underline?
-I like, I'm not craving.

311
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:29,360
Hemorrhage from the nose, a lot of bleeding in your menses?

312
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:40,360
-Yes in the menses and ulcerative colitis I bleed a lot. 16 times the day a bucket.

313
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:50,760
-But otherwise during the period when you were young you did not have.

314
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:57,440
-Not from the nose but when I get hurt I get easily bruises.

315
00:53:03,490 --> 00:53:11,880
-Medorrhinum yes, she says in the sea she has a strong amelioration.

316
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:15,130
-Yes.
-You like the sea?

317
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:19,980
-I like the open air, the water but it's too cold.

318
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:38,740
-This is a controversial being so warm and yet saying that it is very cold for her. In winter

319
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,980
you feel cold?
-I feel cold.

320
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:45,260
-But you said in winter you go out.

321
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:53,330
-Yes I go out like this but if it's a real cold winter, my feet hurt and I have a headache here.

322
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:59,260
-Ice-cream, do you like ice-cream?
-Sometimes before my menses.

323
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:07,410
-It's not important for you.
-No, my husband loves it, he eats it all.

324
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:13,410
-She came here to confuse us.

325
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:29,620
-I wonder if you would add a rubric mind cares full about others. Do you want to take the rubric with the others?

326
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:39,120
-Very good yes. I don't believe the way that she describes the sea is not the amelioration

327
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:40,050
from the sea.

328
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:42,920
-No, it's not amelioration.
-Forget it.

329
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:55,920
Concerning her pathology what you would say?

330
00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:09,690
It is interesting with her organism that suddenly she can go to extreme pathology and

331
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:17,250
then back again to normal. Then extreme pathology, back again to normal.

332
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:29,740
The incident which she relates with Argen nitr, going crazy, is very extreme. That means

333
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:38,760
her organism has easily going off and going back again like Staphysagria.

334
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:47,730
Do you think she is a suppressed person?
-No.

335
00:55:48,480 --> 00:56:00,810
-At this moment she is not suppressed. If you want to describe her character, is the need

336
00:56:00,910 --> 00:56:14,730
to give, maybe underneath you may say she wants to be loved also and that's why etc.

337
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:22,670
but this is apart, the need to give is very. The need to be with people together is another

338
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:33,250
issue that came up and underline her anxiety about her own problems and the problems

339
00:56:33,350 --> 00:56:39,100
of the family, that's another issue that came up.

340
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:52,750
I will tell you, I came to the class with the idea that she was either Pulsatilla or

341
00:56:52,850 --> 00:57:03,510
Medorrhinum. And I wanted to finally to discuss about this and most probably I will go

342
00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:13,260
for the idea of Pulsatilla, in spite of the fact that there is a desire for fat because I have

343
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:21,010
seen it in a case and I have given this information to some seminars.

344
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:32,080
I have found some Pulsatillas which they have strong desire for fat. Nobody remembers

345
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:40,080
this from me? It is there recorded in some of these tapes.

346
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:52,830
So the desire for fat will not take me away, if Pulsatilla symptoms were strong otherwise

347
00:57:52,930 --> 00:58:01,170
and she said desire for butter. Immediately, if you remember in the interview, she said

348
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:10,010
I love butter, which Pulsatilla has aversion to fat but desires butter.

349
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:21,910
As you investigated the case and you asked questions, the idea of Phosphorus came

350
00:58:22,010 --> 00:58:32,260
quite strongly and now my problem is choosing between Phosphorus and Pulsatilla.

351
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:40,690
The idea of Medorrhinum went down but the idea of Phosphorus came quite strongly

352
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:53,580
with some possibility of Causticum but knowing, you see I have seen some Phosphorus

353
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:56,600
being so warm but not Causticum.

354
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:02,470
-It is in the rubric but I have not seen it, it isn't my experience.

355
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:11,890
-There is one keynote with Phosphorus, that's why I thought I'm Phosphorus. That was

356
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:17,480
the only thing I'm sympathetic and this keynote I thought I'm Phosphorus. A lot of times

357
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:31,490
I feel alone in the world, a feeling that I'm alone, I can't explain like I don't have nobody.

358
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:38,930
If you say about depression or something, that's the only closest thing that comes down

359
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:40,290
to being said.

360
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:53,920
-Pulsatilla is not as sympathetic as Phosphorus, not at all. Pulsatilla does not have that

361
00:59:54,020 --> 01:00:09,260
sympathy, a little bit. Phosphorus has it very much and Causticum has it because it

362
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:21,760
feels... There are different reasons why Causticum and Phosphorus are sympathetic for

363
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:42,420
others. The Causticum can not see something which is painful to others and wants

364
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:51,270
immediately to correct it, the idea of Causticum is to correct it, to jump into the picture

365
01:00:51,370 --> 01:00:59,260
and do something and especially the sympathetic element for Causticum came out

366
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:08,760
between this pain and also the injustice. When I see outside the injustice, I feel sympathy

367
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:18,260
for the person to whom is done some injustice, then I have to jump and do it.

368
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:27,850
The Phosphorus is more vulnerable in itself, as if there is no protection and I feel the pain

369
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:40,240
of others because I do not have protection. I go out to them and I feel the...

370
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:51,510
The one has protection and attacks, jumps into the picture. The other is like I'm not

371
01:01:51,610 --> 01:02:02,010
protected, therefore I feel the pain of others. This can go to the extreme, as I have said,

372
01:02:02,110 --> 01:02:09,440
where a Phosphorus can stay inside the house, does not go out in the society where we

373
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:16,680
have insanity with Phosphorus, they don't go outside because they feel the pain with

374
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:22,430
everything which happens around them, so much so, that they can not come in contact

375
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:28,180
with the society and then we have the closed Phosphorus, the sensitive Phosphorus who

376
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:33,430
will not associate. But the reason why he does not associate is because he feels the pain

377
01:02:33,530 --> 01:02:41,780
of others. So it is a matter of non protection, it is different in sense.

378
01:02:55,030 --> 01:03:00,020
Do you know why we are confused in this case?

379
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:12,440
What I think is because she is a homeopath, because she knows the symptoms, she has

380
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:25,190
given us several symptoms, which she says, oh I have this, oh yes I have that and she is

381
01:03:25,290 --> 01:03:38,270
very alive type and perhaps if we go on asking we will discover, she is having a lot of

382
01:03:38,370 --> 01:03:45,520
symptoms. And you see the problem? She has taken not too many remedies but she

383
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:54,770
knows about remedies and that makes it difficult and makes it confusing.

384
01:03:54,870 --> 01:04:03,100
If we took it without her knowing anything, she would highlight the real things which

385
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:09,870
really bother her, now she can confuse us even without her knowing it.

386
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:26,140
I would say what is the intensity for the feelings of others, the sympathy. She said strong, very strong.

387
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:34,440
-It is, it's a problem, too much.

388
01:04:36,930 --> 01:04:38,690
-Let's finish, let's sleep over it.
-No.

389
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:41,780
-You want the solution now?

390
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:50,350
-OK I will give you the solution, quiet.

391
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:04,690
I'll tell you the truth what I think, the absolute truth.

392
01:05:09,930 --> 01:05:11,940
I do not know.

393
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:34,340
We almost forgot her. What shall we do? I thought the matter over this afternoon and I

394
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:38,190
found a very simple solution.

395
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:43,690
-Give both.

396
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:50,270
-No, give first the one and if it does not do anything, give the second.

397
01:05:54,020 --> 01:06:04,280
Which one we give first? My idea eventually was to give first Phosphorus 30.

398
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:15,380
See what happens within a period of 2-3 months, then if she reacts to that, then we can

399
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:24,430
go higher of course. If you have no reaction at all, then you go to Pulsatilla 30.

400
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:31,840
After 2 months, no reaction at all Pulsatilla 30, then from there on you can see.
