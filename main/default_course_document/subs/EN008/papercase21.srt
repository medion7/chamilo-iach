1
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:40,100
In this case, case Nr 23, we have two facts to think.

2
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:57,800
One is 16 years ago, he had some grief and the grief was really very severe

3
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:10,550
and left actually a situation which still is felt today.

4
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:28,940
And later on he had an accident where he remarked that ever since the concussion,

5
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,570
he felt his head was very sensitive, that even the pillow at times seemed too hard.

6
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:46,760
So actually 16 years ago he has a grief, 11 years ago he has an accident.

7
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:57,080
The question that you are going to ask yourself in this case is, has the accident

8
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:07,340
changed the picture and brought out some symptomatology which is characteristic

9
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:14,340
of another remedy than the one Natrum muriaticum, which seems to be indicated

10
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:21,320
due to the fact that he had a grief and also due to the fact that he still desires salty things

11
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,080
and farinaceous food?

12
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:32,330
Both are Natrum muriaticum, aversion to fish also Natrum muriaticum, aversion fat.

13
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:42,060
All his life is a characteristic of Nat. mur. You don't think of Nat. mur.

14
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,170
when you have desire for fat.

15
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:59,230
So what are the symptoms? Since five years he has developed several fears of heart disease,

16
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:03,840
so you have to look in the Repertory fear of heart disease, which is the remedy?

17
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:11,000
Look fear of heart disease?

18
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:24,250
Arnica, Arum, Lachesis, OK.

19
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:33,980
Fear of others approaching him and fear of being touched and fear of sudden death.

20
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,840
So he developed certain fears, which are characteristic of which remedy?

21
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:50,830
Arnica. So your decision here should be between Arnica and Natrum muriaticum.

22
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:54,390
You have symptoms for both these two remedies.

23
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,090
Which is the first remedy that you have to give?

24
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,270
-Arnica.

25
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:05,520
-Arnica, it is the last remedy which developed symptomatology.

26
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:17,370
Therefore the answer to this case is Arnica first and most probably Nat. mur. second.

27
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,510
-A question for the previous case?
-Yes.

28
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:28,360
-How about Ignatia?
-No.

29
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:41,340
Because we don't have aversion to fruits, we don't have the sighing,

30
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:49,200
it doesn't say sighing very much. Brood about her condition.

31
00:04:50,690 --> 00:05:06,190
Nr 24 you have anxiety with panic attacks, with fear of death and palpitations.

32
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:14,610
Also certain recurrent ideas that she could not get out of her mind...

33
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:20,950
after her mother had gone into the hospital for a gall bladder operation.

34
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:30,390
She has fear of narrow or crowded places, of heights, of death, crowds, thunderstorms,

35
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:38,940
earthquake, rats, never goes into a lift, can go up 7 floors by...

36
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:48,940
Never goes into a lift it means she has fear of narrow places, of closed in a narrow places,

37
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,090
desires for company, does not want to be alone, amelioration by consolation,

38
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:59,930
despair of recovery, she wanted reassurance from me that she will get better,

39
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,530
worse from warm weather.

40
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:16,780
Here things are a bit confused between some remedies.

41
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:29,150
As we say, fear of death and anxiety about health and fear of heights and fear of rats,

42
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:37,170
comes to Calcarea carbonica but worse from warm weather does not go with Calcarea carbonica

43
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:47,270
and we have here anxiety about health and panic attacks with fear of death and palpitations.

44
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,170
The main things, the strongest things.

45
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,670
-Argentum nitricum or...?

46
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:58,170
-Also here you could prescribe Phosphorus in this case.

47
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:06,670
-You said Argentum nitricum or Aconitum, what should be the succession? Which first?

48
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:15,170
-Argentum nitricum should be the first and Aconite could be second or third and

49
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:23,350
Phosphorus could be second or third. Phosphorus is justified in case Nr 24.

50
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,600
Who prescribed Phosphorus in case 24?

51
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:40,600
Who prescribed Aconite?

52
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,600
And who prescribed Argentum nitricum?

53
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:53,260
You are getting the idea, this is the idea, because most of the class is getting the idea

54
00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:01,500
how to sort out between several remedies, when several remedies are indicated.

55
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,350
This is most of the cases, you saw it in this case very clearly.

56
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:18,750
-Because you have this keynote of Aconite which is panic attacks with fear of death and palpitation...

57
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:27,650
-You see the panic attacks with fear of death and palpitations is an expression

58
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,250
which you may have an Aconite.

59
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:38,670
The difference is that here should be panic attacks underlined three times,

60
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:46,250
you have Aconite and anxiety about health should be underlined one time.

61
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,890
But there is the other way, anxiety about health with some panic attacks, with fear of death

62
00:08:52,990 --> 00:09:03,040
and palpitation but then you have fear of heights three times where Aconite you don't find.

63
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:11,280
Fear of narrow places underlined three times goes to Aconite and to Argentum nitricum.

64
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:22,870
Desire for company Aconite, do not want to be alone, amelioration by consolation,

65
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:32,100
he wants somebody next to him, worse from warm weather underlined twice,

66
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,850
so the bulk of this symptomatology...

67
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:42,640
You have to choose between Aconite and Arg. nitricum or if you like, Phosphorus.

68
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:51,540
Because Phosphorus has anxiety about health, it can have panic attacks with fear of death

69
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:58,140
but narrow or crowded places we don't see Phosphorus so much.

70
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,560
Fear of heights Phosphorus is there but not so strong.

71
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:13,290
Fear of death Phosphorus is quite strong, fear in crowds, fear of thunderstorms twice,

72
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:21,530
it could be three times, fear of earthquakes you have Aconite, Argentum nitricum and

73
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:27,550
Phosphorus but the most strong are Argentum nitricum and Aconite, three times.

74
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:33,050
That's why the fight is between Aconite and Argentum nitricum.

75
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:37,380
But the Arg. nitr. should be first.

76
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:46,310
Desires sweets, you go there and you see, desires sweets three times,

77
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:52,540
ice cream three times, desires salty things twice, desires sweets and salty it comes

78
00:10:52,640 --> 00:11:00,040
for Argentum nitricum and not for Phosphorus, neither for Aconite because it's strong,

79
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,970
it's very strong.

80
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:15,620
So there are arguments for Aconite but don't try to make it Aconite, forget it.

81
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:21,880
If you give Aconite, it will not act. Aconite will not act here.

82
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:26,720
-How can we search in the Repertory panic attacks?

83
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,730
-I don't think we have a rubric.

84
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:47,040
Fear and panic, which remedy?

85
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:54,940
-Excuse me, can you tell us which are the remedies which we should include

86
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,440
as a rubric of panic in the Repertory?

87
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:04,050
-Which are the remedies? Why should I tell you?

88
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:09,700
-In order to be able to solve better such cases. It should be a rubric.

89
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:20,520
-Why should I tell you? I don't think there is. I give you the Materia Medica of certain...

90
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:25,870
If I give you all the remedies with panic attacks, you will be confused in the end.

91
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,730
Fear of earthquakes, no.

92
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:47,050
It is Stramonium, it is Aconite, Argen. nitricum, Gelsemium, Opium.

93
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:10,860
Panic attacks you have in Arsenicum, Aconite, Argen. nitricum, Platina, Gelsemium,

94
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:27,460
Phosphorus, Hydrophobinum and other remedies.

95
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:39,930
Case 26 in your files. A male patient 35 complaining of pain in the stomach 2-3 hours

96
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:44,190
after eating which feels like if he has a stone in the stomach.

97
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:52,180
Failing memory three times which impairs greatly in his daily life, his dealings and business.

98
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:58,180
Because of this symptom he has felt great inadequacy in his work.

99
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,820
He explained that he remembers a stain in a head injury approximately

100
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,680
one year before his memory loss.

101
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:10,080
Headaches are on the whole head, feels a constriction around his head

102
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,320
as if there is a band around it.

103
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:20,740
He has marked aversion in meeting certain persons and he has been swearing quite a bit.

104
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,650
He likes music and he is very sensitive to music. At the end he told me that

105
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:30,260
because of this loss of memory, he was contemplating suicide.

106
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:43,400
Here we have symptoms of three different remedies, of Anacardium, Arnica

107
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,510
and Natrum carbonicum.

108
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:57,810
The remedy that you should be giving as first, should affect his memory

109
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:04,570
because failing memory three times underlined, which prevents him from doing his work.

110
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:09,560
That means he has a big problem. At the same time he feels inadequate,

111
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,290
that means he feels...

112
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:18,980
It 's a different way of saying I feel that I do not have self-confidence anymore,

113
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:27,730
I have lost my self-confidence. So this is another way of expressing a symptom

114
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:30,170
of Anacardium again.

115
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:41,480
He has marked aversion of meeting certain people. If you go to the Repertory,

116
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:50,260
this is strong, you find it in Natrum carbonicum but it might be

117
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:56,420
because of his failing in the memory, of his complex he has that

118
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,170
he does not like to meet everybody.

119
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:05,710
Therefore this symptom can be explained as a symptom of Anacardium,

120
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:09,530
as a symptom of lack of self-confidence as well.

121
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:19,180
And the swearing also is a symptom of Anacardium, as we said, desire to swear.

122
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:27,180
So the solution is Anacardium and if that does not work, we have the possibility of Arnica,

123
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:33,780
which we give it as a causative factor, because he had an injury, right?

124
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:44,540
One year before this memory loss, he had an injury in his head.

125
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:52,480
It might be that Arnica is indicated, so if you prescribe Arnica in this case you get some marks,

126
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,980
but definitely the first

127
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,560
remedy that you have to prescribe is Anacardium.

128
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:05,980
So who prescribed Anacardium? Very good.

129
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,480
Who prescribed Arnica?

130
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,730
Who prescribed Natrum carbonicum?

131
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,730
We have to sort out, to sort out what?

132
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:25,820
According to these symptoms which are uppermost and are most bothersome

133
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,150
at this moment, right?

134
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:39,970
- I want to put a question about the 26th case. Why it could be Natrum Sulphuricum,

135
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:45,470
because it has an injury to the head, suicidal thoughts, aversion to wet weather

136
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:48,570
and I think also photophobia?
-Yes.

137
00:17:51,060 --> 00:18:01,720
It can not be because the main thing is failing of the memory plus the lack

138
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:06,470
of self confidence, which is expressed in different ways here in the case.

139
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:10,570
So these two elements you can not forget.

140
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:20,720
And also feels a constriction around his head as if there is a band around it.

141
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:31,480
This feeling we said: a band around here and around there and there, is a symptom of Anacardium.

142
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:37,380
So you have enough symptoms to decide on Anacardium

143
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,960
and that's why most of the class decided...

144
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:54,570
Now, who heard the remedy and just wrote it? She is honest. One? Only one?

145
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,820
The Anacardium, I say.

146
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:07,280
No when you read it no, heard by somebody else.

147
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:18,970
Stupid questions I ask, yes.

148
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:39,620
-In the case 26 I took Baryta carbonica, because it doesn't want other people around,

149
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,050
photophobia, worse sun.

150
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:57,210
-That's correct. She says I have written in case 26, I have written down Baryta carbonica,

151
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:06,960
because of the failing of the memory, of the inferiority complex and of the photophobia and

152
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,560
that is correct.

153
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:15,540
What she says is correct because these symptoms belong also to Baryta carb. with one difference.

154
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,300
Where is the difference?

155
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:25,010
It is in a peculiar symptom which belongs absolutely to Anacardium

156
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:30,360
and the peculiar symptom is a band around the head.

157
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:36,290
That they ignore it and that's why they went to Baryta carbonica.

158
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:43,120
I have to give marks for Baryta carbonica.

159
00:20:49,870 --> 00:21:01,260
What I'm interested is that according to the information I'm giving, as I mix the remedies,

160
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:10,020
to be able to sort out the uppermost remedy. This is the most important exercise for me and

161
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,960
for you to go ahead and do it.

162
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:25,470
Do I see every time of half of the time or one third of the time or in no time

163
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:32,830
I found the right remedy? Then something is wrong. I have not got the way of thinking.

164
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:39,730
What we are interested here is to teach you the way of thinking under a circumstance

165
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,320
which is difficult.

166
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:55,140
-I wish to ask you why not Aurum because for example here on case 26.

167
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:02,890
I thought about Aurum because I thought somebody who has suicidal thinking

168
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:10,640
for such a small reason, only that he forgets, we must understand why.

169
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,910
This is the way I thought.

170
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:14,650
-Yes but I will tell you one thing.

171
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:21,650
From reading the case you have to come to conclusion that the failing of memory

172
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:27,150
is a big thing for him because he can not work, he forgets, he is a salesman

173
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,890
and he forgets a lot of things.

174
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:40,060
So this idea of not been able to work anymore leads him as a secondary effect to the idea

175
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:44,900
of I might as well kill myself.

176
00:22:49,900 --> 00:23:01,750
If here was a suicidal tendency underlined 2-3 times without much reason,

177
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:10,710
you had the right to go and think of Aurum. But here under these circumstances,

178
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:20,470
the man has to stop working, he says I have a problem, I can't remember

179
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:24,220
and I have to give up my work and I don't feel confident anymore.

180
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:32,460
I go to people and I forget what I have to say, I lose my memory, what life is this?

181
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,980
I can not continue my life, this is the expression.

182
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:50,170
-It could be also over exertion and in this way you must think also about Aurum

183
00:23:50,270 --> 00:24:05,730
who is working a lot and then he feels I forget, I'm worthless, now my life is away.

184
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,210
-You have to take into consideration everything.

185
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:20,440
He is 35 years old and we did not say he has over exerted himself and because

186
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:25,310
of being absolutely tired, he can not remember. We don't say that.

187
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:33,840
It does not give you the information that you project.

188
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:44,700
On the contrary he gives you failing of the memory without much reason plus the feeling

189
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:55,200
of inadequacy, feeling of losing self confidence, plus a symptom characteristic of Anacardium,

190
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,870
which is a feeling of a band around his head.

191
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:03,390
Therefore the first remedy has to be Anacardium.

192
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:14,030
The cursing, swearing underlined 2-3 times, he gives it as a symptom.

193
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:19,620
He says I was not used, otherwise it won't be written here as a symptom

194
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:24,710
because everybody more or little you swear.

195
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,970
But if you don't swear and suddenly you start swearing, that's a symptom.

196
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:42,110
You won't believe a child 7,8 years old when it's Anacardium or Nitric acid,

197
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:50,440
the parents will say he swears all the time and we don't know where he picks these words

198
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:56,960
because we don't use these words at home and the child swears just like that.

199
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:01,540
It comes to him as a must.

200
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:12,950
-I think the consideration between Baryta carbonica and Anacardium,

201
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:22,730
it says it's failing memory and because of these sudden losses of memory and in Anacardium

202
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:27,690
you have these sudden losses with a blocked of mind

203
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:32,200
but in Bar. carbonica you have a permanent...

204
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:42,840
-Yes and here also you have failing memory, which is strong, you have inadequacy and

205
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:47,950
you have two symptoms of Anacardium, band and swearing.

206
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,830
That takes you straight to Anacardium and this is how you thought most of you

207
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,850
and you wrote Anacardium.

208
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:05,940
Show me again how many? Almost 95%.

209
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:16,940
We have to encounter with the different remedies.

210
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:36,850
The pathology, which is giving in the beginning, with the swelling of the larynx

211
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:48,090
and around the face it gives what? It gives Apis. With insomnia, he wakes up to 2-3 am.

212
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:55,850
and can not sleep again it gives another remedy. It gives Kali Carbonicum which we don't.

213
00:27:55,950 --> 00:28:01,190
She is sexually very alert but every time she has sex, she has sex she feels very tired.

214
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:16,020
Agaricus it might be with some other remedies like Calcarea carbonica, Staphysagria,

215
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:26,520
Medorrhinum. Very conscientious and duty bound, again the idea of Kali Carbonicum comes.

216
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:34,180
Worse from heat underlined three times, forget Kali Carbonicum and go back to Apis.

217
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:40,430
She also suffers from different fears like fear of the dark, heights, rats etc.

218
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:49,570
Fear of dark, heights and rats this combination gives Calcarea carbonica but she is clumsy,

219
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:53,420
dropping things easily back to Apis.

220
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:59,080
She felt tired, emotionally and physically and complained of lack of energy, any remedy.

221
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:05,580
Desires sweets Calc. carbonica, amelioration by cold applications back to Apis,

222
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:12,320
worse after sleep it can be Kali carbonicum, Medorrhinum etc.

223
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:20,670
So the first remedy that you have to prescribe in this case is Apis. Who prescribed Apis?

224
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,720
Very good.
