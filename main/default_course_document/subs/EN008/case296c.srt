1
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:29,640
-So we brought this case because she had a big reaction and I would like to hear about

2
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,550
this reaction after taking the remedy.

3
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,800
-At the moment right now I'm terribly excited.

4
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:43,890
I know the state, my nerve system is tinkling and upheaval, I can not seal myself off

5
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:53,140
any influences, I'm in a very excited state and I just hope I can tell you in the right order

6
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,240
what has happened.

7
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,990
-She can try.

8
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:13,710
-I took the remedy the day before yesterday in the morning and the first reaction was that

9
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:16,730
I had a stinging pain in the heart.

10
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:28,730
Then all the acute symptoms disappeared within 1,5 hour.

11
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:35,130
I was in such a state of euphoria, even though it was raining outside I could have run out

12
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:43,230
and jump through the rain, yuppie I'm alive, so full of zest and joy of life.

13
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:53,150
The day was fine and I also slept well and then the next day, while I was coming up here

14
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:59,880
all the acute symptoms came back with such an intensity, such a violence that I was sitting here

15
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:05,080
in the class, thinking I will not stand through, I felt like I was going to slide down the chair,

16
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:10,180
I couldn't hold myself and it was all back very intense.

17
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,600
-Total exhaustion?

18
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:32,240
-Yes, while I was coming here it was fairly OK but then inside the classroom...

19
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:42,170
-She felt depleted?
-Yes and also all the pains came back.

20
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:46,420
-She means the psychological pains or the physical pains?

21
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:58,990
-The physical pains. I decided to leave in the first break and with every step I took going away

22
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,920
from the Academy, I felt better again and then I thought my god what's wrong with you,

23
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,020
are you such a hypochondriac?

24
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:19,270
But I had strong palpitations and this has remained.

25
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:33,020
Then at home I lied down and I stayed in bed all day but the palpitations remained.

26
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:39,420
The pulse rate itself was not much more high than normal, it was more the feeling,

27
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,670
what's going on.

28
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,770
-The heart was pumping strongly.

29
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:51,520
-Yes, I had the feeling that my heart was so loud that it would make sounds in the room.

30
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:57,770
-But today how are the physical symptoms?

31
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:04,610
-They are all gone, after this night many things are clear and it's all gone.

32
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:10,570
While I was lying there yesterday after some hours I went into my heart and constantly

33
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:15,170
I asked myself where is it happening, what is going on, where it is coming from?

34
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:22,820
While I was lying there, my thoughts went backwards and suddenly I found myself in a state

35
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:29,610
almost around the time when I was born and my mother had tried to abort me when

36
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:34,360
she was pregnant with me and I never really felt accepted, never felt loved,

37
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:38,010
never had the impression I was lovable.

38
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,410
Suddenly I started seeing images from the life of my mother, images of things that had nothing

39
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:52,760
to do with me at all, it was just certain pictures out of the life of my mother I could follow

40
00:04:53,750 --> 00:05:00,100
and suddenly this feeling occurred to me that I felt it's not my fault.

41
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:05,110
I was wandering up and down in my room and kept repeating it's not my fault,

42
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:09,920
it's not my fault that she couldn't live her life the way she wanted to.

43
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:16,670
And I cried and it came from so deep inside.

44
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:32,270
In that moment I would have loved to rush up here and hug you, it was so incredible.

45
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:41,420
So many things straighten out in my mind. So often people said to me, why do you keep apologizing

46
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:50,940
that you are alive and now I have this feeling that I seem to be worth loving after all.

47
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:58,180
And these feelings of guilt, I was never aware of.

48
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:05,820
-She was never aware?
-Not in this degree.

49
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:11,090
Of course when I look back at my life I can see that I was behaving in such a way

50
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:19,320
but I was not aware of it and also when I saw these images of my mother yesterday I also realized

51
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:24,070
that it was not her who blamed me for the way she lived, it was me, myself

52
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,910
who took up this responsibility.

53
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:32,260
-Blaming herself. Very deep analytical work.

54
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:52,460
She had any traumatic experience with her previous husband that came up during that period?

55
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,430
-Not yesterday.

56
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:02,860
-It was concerning her mother and her relationship with that issue.

57
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,960
-Yes it went on for hours but I don't want to spread it all down here right now.

58
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:15,260
-How does she feel now?
-Liberated, free.

59
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,800
It's like I just can't believe it.

60
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:17,140
Just a few comments so you know where you are and what is happening.

61
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:31,290
Can anybody tell me why there was such an amelioration the first day and then

62
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:34,640
the second day such aggravation?

63
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:52,040
First I felt very happy, very much energy and then all the physical symptoms came back the pains,

64
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:56,620
everything that was as an acute state, they came back.

65
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:04,970
Why it was this sequence, first better and then worse, can anybody tell me?

66
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:16,370
She comes here, she is depleted of energy, she has a relapse on the depression when

67
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:23,720
she comes, the energy is low and she is developing an acute.

68
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,570
Then she takes the remedy and what happens?

69
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:34,610
It is that the energy gets up and the psychological state in general becomes very good,

70
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:41,110
she was so happy and then all the force of the disturbance goes to the physical body,

71
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,460
that's very simple.

72
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:57,360
Then the physical it continues and gets it out as well and then what happens is further,

73
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:01,470
she has a deep problem which she never realized actually.

74
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:09,740
Then that comes to her awareness because the organism is strong enough to face that rejection

75
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,500
or what she thought it was a rejection.

76
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:21,490
And she analyses and she understands that was a rejection that came from me, not from my mother

77
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:28,990
but now I'm in a position to face that fear, which I had all my life, which was the basis

78
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:37,740
of the depression and she faces so automatically, why?

79
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:48,760
Because she is back to health. It's very simple.

80
00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:01,910
-Since two days I know that I'm going to have a follow up today and since then I've been really

81
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:06,040
occupying myself with me and my personal story.

82
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,260
Now I can tell you what happened after Phosphorus.

83
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:27,080
I got the second dose from you in May, then I had a reaction afterwards and a second follow up

84
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:34,180
and I was very happy afterwards, completely flowing, like a child, I could jump all the time.

85
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:47,930
And it was so clear to me now it's going on like this, I have all the strength to do the things

86
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:54,660
but then it went down again. I got in a short of a depressive state, it was not as bad as it has been

87
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,840
but it was still there.

88
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:10,930
-How long ago after the remedy?
-About 4 weeks.

89
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,910
-She started going down?

90
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:20,910
-It went down already after 10 days and when I got so depressive I got really scared

91
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:26,340
because I have already been at the point that I wondered shall I jump.

92
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:35,280
So I went back to see my homeopath in Berlin because I felt I needed a talk and

93
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:42,680
after we had talked together he said he was very sure that he had seen my remedy.

94
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:54,080
He wasn't convinced about Phosphorus and I asked him again, are you sure

95
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,430
and he said absolutely.

96
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:11,660
He gave me Silica, it didn't do anything, first he gave me C200 and then he repeated it in 1M.

97
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:22,260
Then he gave me Tuberculinum, it didn't do anything either, then I had Pulsatilla.

98
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:32,030
Pulsatilla was a little good but not very much, then I had Carcinosin.

99
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:39,480
With Carcinosin something changed, not so prominent but I felt a little better and I started

100
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:47,980
to eat different things again and to feel appetite, more spicy and I tried some meat again

101
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,170
which I haven't had since I was 17.

102
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:59,910
In the end of November he gave me Rhus tox in 1M and with this I made a proving.

103
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:14,320
I got a skin eruption, Rhus eruption and very strong pains in the left side of my back, which partially

104
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:19,570
are still there but then they were really bad, I hardly could move and I was just moaning

105
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,170
because of the pains.

106
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:30,350
I have had Chlamydia, I told you this in the first follow up and then you said this is a good reaction

107
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:38,820
after the remedy but because they didn't go away, I took antibiotics in February.

108
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,620
-This year?

109
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:55,080
-Yes, then I ventured by myself Staphysagria C200 but it didn't do very much either.

110
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:06,140
The whole winter time I have had tonsils and mucus going down from the nose and then

111
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,070
I had a treatment with my own blood.

112
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:15,080
-Isopathy?
-Isopathy to strengthen my immune system.

113
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:28,230
I had two flues in winter, one was in February and the temperature went up to 39,5 and

114
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:33,360
a friend of mine said, why don't you take Bryonia? And this really helped me.

115
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:43,060
Concerning my physical complains, I still have a low blood pressure, it's often 90 to 60

116
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,410
and taking a hot bath is helping.

117
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:53,420
I have cold hands and feet, every now and then I have a stitching pain in my thyroid gland,

118
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:59,240
my hands often feel numbed, it's like Raynaud's.

119
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:10,490
I still drink a lot but warm and cold in the same quantity.

120
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:18,490
-When she says warm, she means not warm water, she drinks tea or warm water?

121
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:32,330
-Normally I would drink tea but it's a short time that I started to drink warm water.

122
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:37,580
-Somebody told her is good?
-Yes.

123
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:50,830
Still I'm very frightful, I'm very sensitive to odors and to noises.

124
00:16:54,070 --> 00:17:01,320
When I jump or run fast I have incontinence for urine, just some drops.

125
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:11,880
My energy is changing but never I'm really on the top of it and I'm still in between,

126
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:17,560
not in my full energy. And the best for me is if I have a nap at noon.

127
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:24,480
Sun I can't tolerate that well, it's uncomfortable to be in the sun.

128
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:32,880
I told you I have the pain in the back after Rhus tox and now I have both kidneys I have at least

129
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:39,130
the part of the back around the kidneys is somehow hurting, not so strongly,

130
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,430
it's not an acute pain.

131
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:48,900
-It's dull, deep or muscular?

132
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:54,900
-I don't think it's muscular, I really think it's the kidneys. It feels it's where are the kidneys.

133
00:17:55,650 --> 00:18:07,900
-What antibiotics she took?
-I don't know.

134
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:17,400
-They were given by a gynecologist?
-Yes.

135
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:28,150
-For how long she took the antibiotic?
-One week.

136
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:36,300
When the lecture started here, I realized it was the second or third day, it was too much for me,

137
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:43,500
it's too noisy, it's too much going on. I had to leave and I felt like before

138
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,400
when the Phosphorus was repeated.

139
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:04,290
Immediately after I took the Phosphorus I was still in a Phosphorus state, then a colleague gave me

140
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:13,200
Phosphorus in LM 8 and immediately with this I felt better, I could take a deep breath but

141
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:21,210
then my lungs went down again and it was like Phosphorus before, I was happy again

142
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:24,060
and I was jumping about in the evening.

143
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,090
-Which day she took this Phosphorus 8?

144
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:37,640
-It must have been Tuesday or Wednesday last week.

145
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:47,390
-10 days now. She takes every day or just one dose?

146
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:54,040
-I just took one dose and then I took a second one when I felt so excited again, my palpitations

147
00:19:54,140 --> 00:20:00,390
are so restless. But I wasn't in complete Phosphorus state, so it didn't do that much.

148
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:05,390
-The second time.
-It was more prophylactic.

149
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:17,890
-This is the LM potencies?
-Yes, Q potencies.

150
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:24,340
I had a dream the first night when I arrived here on the island.

151
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:30,510
I saw a children's handkerchief and handkerchief on this there were several teeth lying.

152
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:42,170
Some of them were mine but it was the back teeth, the big one and it was only the crowns

153
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:47,920
and then I said, these I take, I don't let anybody take them away from me, these are mine.

154
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:59,680
-During all this year, did she experience any fear during thunderstorm?

155
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:04,580
-Maybe once, I was afraid when I was a child but then my grandmother explained me

156
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,680
that you have to count and by the counting how far away it is...

157
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,960
And today I must say, I love thunderstorms.

158
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:30,210
-I think it's OK, it's enough information for me.

159
00:21:52,600 --> 00:22:02,350
The conclusion with this case that we just saw is that she is still on Phosphorus layer.

160
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:11,760
So therefore the suggestion for this case will be since she started with LM8,

161
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:19,000
to continue with LM8, as she needs it, the moment she goes down, she will understand

162
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:27,100
and she will repeat LM, then she can go from there upwards again.

163
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:59,750
I just want to make a remark which does not concern so much spirituality

164
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:17,250
but how the Phosphorus is suffering through relationships because they feel very much

165
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,600
the pain of others.

166
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:34,250
When the quality of the person is a very good quality, then they suffer because of what they see

167
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:39,100
as suffering in other people.

168
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:53,000
You get Phosphorus who are more resistant but it is interesting that it is a kind of,

169
00:23:53,100 --> 00:24:12,360
I would say, innocence because there is this lack of protection.

170
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:26,500
Somebody who is aware is protecting himself much more, the Phosphorus do not have

171
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:35,770
the means to protect themselves and this comes through again as a possibility for her.

172
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:54,170
I don't think the remedies that she took did anything but if she went into such condition

173
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:57,520
what would help her most probably would be Aurum.

174
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:04,350
And Aurum might had helped her to get out of it much faster.

175
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:16,250
But since now after all this going around she is back into the Phosphorus state,

176
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,270
we continue with the Phosphorus.

177
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:37,020
-I have 13 symptoms and Phosphorus is 28, how come?

178
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,830
-It depends what you put in the computer.

179
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:45,960
-What can I put in the computer when the Phosphorus is there?

180
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:55,920
-It depends, she said few things, symptoms that are not really important.

181
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:07,850
The important things here were what she implied, the very strong sympathetic element

182
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:22,700
which had to be very strong, the excessive thirst, they give you the idea of Phosphorus.

183
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,100
You don't need a third symptom.

184
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:39,350
Now why she drinks the warm water, most probably, as I said immediately, somebody told you

185
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:41,950
it's good for you? Yes, she said.

186
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:50,610
This is why she drinks hot water because there are some ideas, you know your type is not good

187
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:55,870
to have cold, cold is very bad for you, whatever.

188
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:07,180
Cold is bad, therefore you drink warm water and if you are in a sensitive state

189
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,530
and you need some help, then you try also hot water.

190
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:19,130
-Can it be that Phosphorus has to be repeated more often because that's the third time

191
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:29,100
that it doesn't keep ...It maybe that you have to repeat more often the Phosphorus?

192
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:38,350
-Yes. I would say that Phosphorus is a sensitive remedy ,a remedy which is spoiled easily

193
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:51,200
in your bottles, you have to have in mind this and the LM I like the idea, since it has acted.

194
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:59,450
Low potency she can repeat more often until she gets out of the layer of Phosphorus.
