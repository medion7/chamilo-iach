1
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:28,660
-So the problem is that I had some symptoms after the caesarean operation

2
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:45,510
I had 3 years ago and during the anesthesia I was conscious somehow.

3
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:51,010
This had a very frightening effect on me.

4
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,520
Since then I think I couldn't quite recover from that moment.

5
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:10,750
-What was the fright?
-I was aware of myself and all the surrounding.

6
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:18,600
It was like darkness and I couldn't perceive my body, just the darkness

7
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:22,510
and it was very frightening experience.

8
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:31,420
-During the anesthesia you were aware and you could see the operation?

9
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:39,660
-No, I couldn't see, just I was not totally unconscious, I could think,

10
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,260
I was not sleeping but I didn't see.

11
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,420
-Did you feel the pain?
-No.

12
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:55,330
It was like a point in the darkness, that can be the description.

13
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:00,930
I didn't feel the body, I didn't feel anything but I was aware of myself.

14
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:07,910
-Aware of yourself but not of pain, not of hearing the doctors, what they say.

15
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:16,340
No, only in the end when I started to recover, I started to hear.

16
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:27,990
Of course the doctors were shouting that I should breathe but I didn't feel my body.

17
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:32,990
They said breathe, I said I would like to breathe but I don't know how,

18
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:37,250
I'm not feeling anything and I think I have recovered very slowly.

19
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,840
It was a long time until they could bring me to my senses.

20
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:51,660
-So you went very far out.
-I think so and I could perceive how I was.

21
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:58,160
The moment when it was cut off so to see the image from reality,

22
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:04,740
I could perceive that something like spy... the noise has became metallic,

23
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,770
it was very frightening.

24
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,610
-Did you have a reaction after you came back, you were trembling?

25
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,770
-Yes.

26
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:25,690
-Can you describe exactly what happened?

27
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:32,810
-It is a trembling that usually patients experience after operation,

28
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:41,240
some of them so they have to give me some medicines for this and to cover me very well.

29
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,750
Some injections, I don't know exactly what it was.

30
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:57,900
But it was nothing so unusual for the people who saw me, only my own experience was not good.

31
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:06,970
-And after that what happened? What was left?

32
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:10,720
-Fear because I connect some of the syndromes that I have now with that moment.

33
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:18,470
I think it had a very bad impact on me. I started to have some dizziness

34
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:22,570
but not immediately after the operation, after some time.

35
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:26,120
Before that I had never had such things.

36
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:36,830
And two times I had acute episodes of vertigo.

37
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:49,470
One was approximately 1 year after the childbirth and it was preceded by impaired hearing,

38
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:58,820
so for 2-3 days I couldn't hear very well and then an episode of vertigo came with nausea.

39
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:07,060
I think also I was very tired because the first year I stayed at home.

40
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:14,560
This implicated a lot of work, I was alone very much because my husband was coming

41
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:22,150
very late from work, so I was very much time worried and alone with the child.

42
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:34,420
And then I started the work and probably it was too many duties to fulfill

43
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:42,720
and this thing happened. I also was drinking very much coffee at that time.

44
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:49,170
I connected somehow this with the fact that I was drinking coffee, I stopped drinking

45
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:59,380
and I was taking some phenylamine for a few days before for an allergic rhinitis.

46
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,560
Maybe it has a connection also, antihistamines.

47
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:10,530
-Do you still have the rhinitis?
-It was almost gone.

48
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:16,630
Sometimes very little but it was not very bothering at that time also.

49
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:29,320
-But definitely you had some reactions from the rhinitis and hay fever which are not there.

50
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:33,210
-Now almost not at all, very seldom.

51
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:44,110
Then another episode on this vertigo was a few weeks ago.

52
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:53,940
Some kind it is connected with the anticipation, before the travel. Ailments anticipation.

53
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,440
-It was things turning around?

54
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:02,020
-It was balancing, left to right, right to left.

55
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,690
-You had the tendency to fall?

56
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:13,450
-I was sleeping and suddenly I woke up in the night, 3-4 o'clock in the night

57
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:27,690
and I moved my head and then I perceived this unbalancing. It was induced by moving the head.

58
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,940
If I didn't move the head, it was OK.

59
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:42,770
-Did you check with your otolaryngologist to see the labyrinth in what condition it is?

60
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,010
-No I didn't.

61
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:50,120
Because I had it only once this and then I had it now some weeks before I came here.

62
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,360
-Your hearing is good now?
-Yes.

63
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,710
-No problem?
-No problem.

64
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:08,380
Usually I have a problem with the movement, if the movement is too quick, for instance in a car,

65
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,960
I don't like that and I may have car sickness.

66
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:21,020
-If you turn around suddenly your head, do you have problem like this?

67
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,030
-Usually I don't have problems but now I start to avoid doing this because I'm afraid

68
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,370
to cause something.

69
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:38,770
-This dizziness and vertigo started how long after your pregnancy?

70
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,880
-1 year after.

71
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:53,250
-In the mean time in that year, did you have anything else like rhinitis?

72
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:56,280
-No, it was not too strong.

73
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:06,670
-Did you experience a fear which stayed afterwards? It remained? What kind of fear?

74
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:16,030
-Yes, I developed strong fear of death. Maybe I had it before but not so strong.

75
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:26,440
Now it appeared this anxiety of death, that death might occur at any moment.

76
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,450
It was not so safe anymore.

77
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,640
-This was an out of body experience, a death like experience as they call it.

78
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:47,230
-But it was not very complete. I was stopped in a point which was very bad.

79
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:51,060
-You stopped to a black point which frightened you absolutely.

80
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:02,710
What else concerning menses and things like that?

81
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:10,650
-Menses are rather abundant and clotted.

82
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:19,740
-Black clots?
-The clots are dark but the blood is not dark.

83
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:26,980
It's not very bothering but I think it's too abundant.

84
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:34,980
-Before menses you feel good?
-Yes, I don't think I have any problems.

85
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:48,630
-In your medical history is something important?
-I had mononucleosis.

86
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:52,240
-At what age?
-14 or 15 years.

87
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:07,230
It was severe form with involvement of the liver and I had to take cortisone in order to recover.

88
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:21,970
Otherwise I think I had the children diseases, most of it, a lot of tonsillitis and

89
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:25,570
antibiotics during childhood.

90
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:35,070
-Since when is this operation?
-3 years ago.

91
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:44,320
-Since that time do you get acutes?
-Yes, I have.

92
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:51,220
This winter I had a very bad flu which lasted for 3 weeks.

93
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,070
I had to stay at home.

94
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:57,130
-Do you have any tonsillitis?

95
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:03,990
-Sometimes I have some colds with the involvement of the tonsils.

96
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:11,390
This year I took Silica for the flu. And it ended.

97
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:16,630
I stayed like this with the flu for 3 weeks and then I decided I have to take a remedy.

98
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:23,490
-What remedies so far you have taken?
-I took Staphysagria for many years.

99
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,150
-And you are still married?
-Yes.

100
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,050
-What was the effect of Staphysagria? Positive effect?

101
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,630
-I think it was positive.

102
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:39,910
-You felt better psychologically?

103
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:48,580
-Yes because I felt a lot of indignation, I had some parents with the parents in law

104
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:54,670
because they are very domineering people. It was a problem in that.

105
00:12:54,770 --> 00:13:01,100
Indeed I was thinking to divorce many times but I didn't in the end.

106
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,740
-You had repeatedly Staphysagria?

107
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,990
-Yes, during the pregnancy for instance I also took.

108
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:14,500
I didn't dare to take it by myself so I consulted somebody.

109
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,500
-After the pregnancy did you get Staphysagria at all?

110
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:24,010
-Yes, after the operation. It was very good, I recovered very well from the operation.

111
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:28,420
I also took Arnica in the operation.

112
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:34,390
-What else you took?

113
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:44,250
-Then Lycopodium in 1996, it was followed by a very big aggravation I think.

114
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:50,450
-And then you had amelioration?
-No, only aggravation.

115
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:53,450
-Why you took Lycopodium? You had some digestive problems?

116
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,950
-On that time yes.

117
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:59,940
I had very much rumbling and abdominal distention, especially in public places,

118
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,550
where it's very embarrassing.

119
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:07,270
-You were a shy person?

120
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:14,090
-I couldn't speak in public at all and I can not now. It's very big problem for me to speak.

121
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:22,430
I can do it very seldom if I'm forced to do it, let's say to give a lecture about physiotherapy,

122
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:28,100
as I had to do it sometimes and I could do it but it's a very big effort.

123
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,000
So this was the Lycopodium.

124
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:41,850
Then I took Natrum muriaticum last year with some good results.

125
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,250
-On physical level?

126
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:51,570
-On this dizziness. I think I did not have it for many months afterwards.

127
00:14:51,670 --> 00:15:00,160
-You took what potency?
-I took LM potencies for maybe two weeks.

128
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,250
-And then you felt good for months?

129
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:05,660
-I had a slight aggravation and then it stopped and then I felt good.

130
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,410
-Did you repeated it?
-I didn't because I felt very well.

131
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:16,410
When I prepared to travel, I had this again and I didn't know what to take,

132
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:21,990
I thought it's better not to take anything now.

133
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:30,610
-When did you take Natrum muriaticum last time?
-In August last year.

134
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:33,960
-And Silica?
-Silica in February.

135
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:46,980
And also I took for some colds oscillococcinum I think it was not a good idea.

136
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:53,380
- Oscillococcinum is good only for the pharmacy.

137
00:15:55,370 --> 00:16:13,630
-It has an effect but it's not good. And for the flu I also tried to take Arsenicum in February.

138
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,020
-No effect?

139
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,030
-It had an effect but the flu didn't finish, so I took Silica.

140
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:25,780
-Now what brings you here is actually the fear or the vertigo?

141
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,190
-This problem with the vertigo.

142
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:32,980
-Not the fear of death?
-Also that is a problem.

143
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:39,720
-It's also a problem still the fact that you can not appear in public, that you have a timidity?

144
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,540
-Yes.

145
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,780
-This is a big problem, timidity is still there.

146
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,730
-Yes, especially in public.

147
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:56,580
-Now you sit there and you are so nice, you speak very softly,

148
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:03,540
but we don't understand anything about your real nature.

149
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:09,790
-Sometimes when I have such kind of excitement, emotion I have an inner trembling.

150
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:15,890
I don't have it now but usually in such a situation I could have that, a strong trembling.

151
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:23,780
-Can you describe aspects of your character?

152
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:32,190
-I think I'm very timid, closed person rather than low self confidence.

153
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:38,690
I like to read very much.

154
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:49,160
This is what I like best to do, to study, to find out about things to read philosophy.

155
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:55,590
-Philosophy which is towards religion? Towards finding truth?

156
00:17:55,690 --> 00:18:10,680
-Yes towards religion. I was very interested in this since childhood.

157
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:17,100
-14-15?
-Something like that.

158
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:25,740
At that time my grand parents died, one after another and I think this put me to think

159
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,190
what was this all about.

160
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:42,830
-Because of your grand parents?
-They were very old and they died.

161
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:50,590
-Because you saw them dying and then you started questioning the idea of death and

162
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:54,090
why we are here and what we're doing and all of that?

163
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:56,190
-Yes.

164
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:02,080
-And then you went to study Medicine. Why you studied Medicine?

165
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:13,340
-I was willing more to help. I was thinking how can I help and how can I understand

166
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:20,090
things better. I think it was more from my wish for knowledge.

167
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,500
-Did you take a specialty?

168
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:29,360
-Yes, I'm doing physiotherapy and rehabilitation and also acupuncture

169
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:38,930
and I work on a Foundation for homeopathy in Bucharest.

170
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:46,570
-You are quite active.
-Yes, I think so.

171
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:50,080
This also might be a problem because they are too many things I'm trying to do.

172
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:53,170
-How many children you have?
-Only one.

173
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:57,130
-You don't want another one? You don't want the experience.

174
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:04,380
-No. And I don't have too much time, I have to concentrate in too many things.

175
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:17,650
-Yes, that's what I see. So this dizziness developed after the operation.

176
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:23,510
-Yes, maybe because of fatigue also. I was very tired, I felt very weak.

177
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,230
I'm not so weak now.

178
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:37,630
-Except of the medication which you took during the pregnancy and the operation

179
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:40,880
did you take any other medications? Drugs?

180
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:49,880
-No. Now because I have this dizziness I try to take, I took Torecan,

181
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:54,620
this is something special for this.

182
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,120
-Does it relieve at all?

183
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:02,370
-I took it afterwards, I didn't have it in the house when it happened.

184
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:06,480
For the moment it passed away in a few minutes.

185
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,320
-Do you have tendency to vomit?

186
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:16,550
-Yes, when I travel in a car for instance, if I'm staying on the back of the car.

187
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,840
-So sea sickness is quite strong for you?

188
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:26,540
-It was not until now on a boat, on a rough sea. I don't know if I have sea sickness.

189
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,380
But I think I have it. In the car, if I stay in the back seat.

190
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:38,220
-And it makes turns?
-Yes, then I have to vomit. Strong nausea.

191
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:50,980
Also the last times I don't fall asleep so easily but this is only in the recent time.

192
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,460
Usually when I'm at home it's not such a problem.

193
00:21:53,560 --> 00:22:01,210
-You go at bed at 11 and you sleep at 1?
-Not so bad.

194
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:05,630
I need half an hour but usually I don't need so much time and it's not so pleasant

195
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:09,380
to go to sleep. I want to go as late as possible.

196
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,890
-Why is not so pleasant? You feel you enter death again?

197
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:19,880
-Maybe it's connected with this.

198
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:24,380
-But you are not conscious, you are not afraid that maybe you are not waking up.

199
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:31,090
-No, no. Only the moment when I get asleep, it's not a pleasant moment.

200
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,600
The process of getting asleep.

201
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:38,360
-The process of going into sleep is not nice?
-No.

202
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:45,510
-That means you are almost resisting going into that state.

203
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:53,090
-Yes, but this is not always. For instance here I experienced this feeling

204
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:58,950
because I'm away from home and maybe this has an impact.

205
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:07,360
-Insecurity develops. It's increased your insecurity and then you have this.

206
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:16,920
-I wanted to say more about some other fears I have.

207
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:20,270
Fear of airplanes.

208
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:26,190
-For crushing?
-Yes.

209
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:37,440
Fear of narrow places, but not so strong. Of dark.

210
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:45,590
Because I can not control very well these things I think I develop fear of insanity.

211
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:51,770
Because of the symptoms which are very strange.

212
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:58,340
-This fear of insanity bothers you?

213
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:03,830
-No, it doesn't bother me but I'm thinking, I don't know what is this all about

214
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:05,940
and I'm worried.

215
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:20,190
-Fear of dark how strong it is?
-It was strong before. Now it's not so strong.

216
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:34,960
-I may say I am a slow person. I have slow reactions, slow movements.

217
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:42,000
I don't like to be pressed to do things quickly and the last time I had to do everything

218
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:46,340
very quickly, because of too many things to do.

219
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,330
There is not so much time to relax, to stay quiet.

220
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:04,990
-Do you have fear of thunderstorms? Here with these thunderstorms yesterday?

221
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:09,930
-Yes, I have. I don't like it.

222
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:22,660
-How long you are married?
-10 years.

223
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:27,510
-And you had an affair with this man before?
-No.

224
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:36,760
We fell in love and we got married very quickly, in a few months.

225
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:41,410
-What did you tell him? Either you marry me or you lose me?

226
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:44,010
-Yes, something like that.

227
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,400
-You did not want nonsense.

228
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:50,590
-No but he is also a person who doesn't like nonsense.

229
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,130
-You had lots of affairs before?
-No, not at all.

230
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,490
-Do you feel good in sexual matters?

231
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:17,590
-Yes, only in the last time because of the fatigue I'm in desire a little bit diminished.

232
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:24,600
-Can you give me your desires and aversions for food?

233
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:39,740
-Desire mainly for cheese, vegetables, fruits, sweets very much.

234
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:45,310
-What kind?
-Chocolate and others.

235
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:46,350
-Ice cream?

236
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:53,360
-Not so much because of the tonsillitis problem. I can have very easily a cold.

237
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:59,310
-You get a cold, not tonsillitis. Tonsillitis is with high fever.

238
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:09,810
-No, I can get a high fever. Meat I can eat but it's not favorite.

239
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:15,160
-Fat of meat?
-I have an aversion for fat.

240
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:18,660
-Eggs?
-Eggs I like.

241
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,560
-What else you like?

242
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:34,480
-All this is what I like and I have a slight aversion to milk. And coffee aggravates.

243
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,740
-How many times you would underline aversion fat, yourself?

244
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:51,480
-3 times. And as I told you I can't drink coffee. This realization of dizziness.

245
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:56,060
-Now you can't drink. Before?
-Before I drunk very much.

246
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,810
-Now if you drink coffee, sensation of dizziness increases.

247
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:06,910
-Yes, so I didn't try to drink at all. But before I could drink 3-4 cups the day.

248
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,490
-No problem, no affecting your sleep?

249
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:14,080
-No, I could drink before I go to sleep and it was no problem.

250
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:20,490
-When you wake up in the morning is OK or there is a problem?

251
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:24,080
-It's OK my sleep is good, is refreshing.

252
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:29,980
-You sleep in a particular position? You like to sleep in a particular position?

253
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,080
-Yes, it's better on the left side.

254
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:41,730
-Do you perspire during sleep?
-During sleep no but usually I perspire.

255
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:47,070
-Where mostly?
-In the axillar region.

256
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:57,580
-What about this cervical region or back?
-Not especially, maybe the feet.

257
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:03,230
-Cold perspiration, clammy, sticky?

258
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:09,660
-A little bit and I have the extremities cold.

259
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:14,750
-Do you have to wear socks in bed?
-Yes.

260
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:23,070
-Do you take the shocks out during sleep?
-Yes after some time.

261
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:29,080
-Your nails are strong or brittle?
-Brittle.

262
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:38,080
-The eggs that you like must be boiled?
-Soft boiled usually.

263
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,820
-Why you laugh? You realize as you said your symptoms?

264
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:51,000
-The remedy. I was thinking also about this remedy but I'm not very sure.

265
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,150
I think I forgot to say that I took Calcarea carbonica.

266
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:03,750
-When?

267
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:11,250
-After Lycopodium, after that aggravation somebody recommended me to take Calcarea.

268
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:20,650
I also took LN potencies and it was good effect I might say but after some time

269
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:28,270
it ceased this effect. Then I tried to take a C30, I think I didn't feel much effect.

270
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:32,330
-You didn't feel anything with C30.

271
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,740
Do you have a problem looking downwards from high place?

272
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,230
-I don't like it.

273
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:54,740
-Do you have vertigo, dizziness, things like that?

274
00:30:54,840 --> 00:31:17,830
-No, just a kind of fear. I also ate a lot since the childbirth, I put a lot of kilos.

275
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:28,580
Because eating seems to ameliorate in general. It made me feel very good.

276
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:33,580
I put 8-9 kilos.

277
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:39,740
-How much salt do you use? Normal, more than normal?

278
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,230
-I like salt but I don't know if I like more than the others, I don't think I put very much.

279
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:46,750
-It's not something excessive.
-No.

280
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:13,390
-You cry easily?
-Not so easily.

281
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:19,150
-You like consolation?
-Yes it doesn't bother me. I like now.

282
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:24,150
-You like consolation from your husband or from your friends, from anybody?

283
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:30,400
-Not from anybody. I think I need some kind of help now because I have too many things to do

284
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:36,750
and consolation if it is followed by some help is very good.

285
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:43,920
-You are practical.
-This kind of consolation.

286
00:32:44,020 --> 00:33:01,400
-No nonsense. You have a big problem. I'm afraid something is going on with your labyrinth,

287
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:19,490
a little bit of inflammation, sub-acute, but let's see.

288
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:29,400
Do you have clear mind? Do you remember? You study and you learn?

289
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,750
-Yes I think it's not affected.

290
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:39,650
Only sometimes if I am too busy and I have too many things to do, I become more forgetful.

291
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:46,910
After a busy day it may happen I can't remember very well a telephone number.

292
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:16,790
There were some cancers in the family. My father died from cancer 6 years ago

293
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:30,120
and I think also the grand father, the father of my father had cancer but he died in very old age,

294
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:34,230
85 with cancer.

295
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:56,570
-Do you bite your nails?
-No.

296
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:04,980
-The foot nails do they enter in the flesh?
-No.

297
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:10,880
-The water you drink is how much, your thirst is normal?

298
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:15,390
-It's not so big, maybe less than normal.

299
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:20,630
-Do you prefer warm drinks, cold drinks or depends on the season?

300
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:24,720
-Not warm like tea but not very cold,

301
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:29,970
-Because again you are afraid of the cold.
-Yes.

302
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:35,980
-But you would prefer cold?
-Not very cold.

303
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:43,390
-In general you will say you are a person who is aggravated by cold?

304
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:44,980
-Yes.

305
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:51,280
-And you are also aggravated by wet cold weather?

306
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:59,060
-Not so much, by the cold especially but also I'm aggravated by sun.

307
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:08,870
I do not like to walk in the sun, I must have something on my head to cover the head.

308
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:12,540
Otherwise I feel weak and it's not good.

309
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:17,140
-You are very sensitive to sun?
-I should say yes.

310
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:21,380
-Milk you never drink?

311
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,380
-I drink but I don't like, especially the boiled milk.

312
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:32,340
-You drink it.
-Not so much, I prefer yogurt, cheese.

313
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:39,080
-If they tell you have to drink a glass of milk, you will be able to drink it?

314
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:43,380
-Yes I will be able but I don't like it.

315
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:51,070
-You can drink it pure or if you put cocoa?

316
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:56,060
-I can drink but for instance when I put in breakfast some milk, I forget to drink it

317
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:06,390
because I don't like it. I have to force myself to drink the milk because I know it's healthy.

318
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:16,530
-You think of the health that you need some milk but you can not drink it.

319
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:17,890
-Yes.

320
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:27,520
-The desire for cheese is really very strong? Pathological desire?

321
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,360
-No.

322
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:33,260
-For vegetables?
-I think it's normal.

323
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:37,520
-Fruits?
-Normal.

324
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:41,770
-Sweets.
-Oh sweets I like them exaggerated.

325
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:46,020
-And the aversion to fat also.
-Yes.

326
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:51,520
-The desire for eggs normal?
-Normal I think.

327
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:01,410
-Do you see any special dreams which are repeated?

328
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:08,760
-Yes, I may have sometimes clairvoyant dreams but not very often.

329
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:20,910
-These dreams are always something bad will happen or it can be this or that?

330
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:24,160
-Not necessarily something bad.

331
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:29,160
-Sometimes it's going to happen and you see it in your dreams?

332
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:34,740
-Yes, for instance before my father has died, 9 months before when I didn't know

333
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:42,940
he was ill, I was dreaming he told me he will die because he had cancer. It was true.

334
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,830
-Before he knew he had cancer.

335
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:53,830
-Yes and then I went to see him, he was quite OK. He had no problems.

336
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:59,090
I couldn't start to check him because he seemed to be very healthy.

337
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:08,190
And dreams of the dead, some dead relatives.

338
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:35,120
-Are you jealous?
-I don't think so.

339
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:40,830
-You can tight your clothes around your neck?
-Yes.

340
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:45,580
-You can sleep in the afternoon?
-I can but I don't like very much.

341
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,810
-Because you lose time or because you wake up unrefreshed.

342
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:57,420
-Because if I sleep too much I have a bad sensation.

343
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:09,740
-Over sleeping makes you feel bad in general.
-In the afternoon yes. I'm more tired.

344
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:13,740
-How is your energy at this moment? How would you classify your energy?

345
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:18,510
-I think it's good now, I used to be more tired before.

346
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:29,500
-When did you take Calcarea carb. 30? How long ago?

347
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,340
-More than 1 year.

348
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:36,000
-But you noticed no effect with Calcarea carbonica?

349
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:42,920
-After C30 no. But after the LN potencies yes, it was good.

350
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,070
-Did you take Conium also?
-No.

351
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:52,170
-Belladonna?
-Belladonna for some colds.

352
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:58,490
-If you lie on left is better for you dizziness?

353
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:03,840
-No, it's just a position that I fall asleep more easily.

354
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:08,820
-Not that if you have dizziness and you lie on the left, you are better?

355
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,420
-No.

356
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,170
-OK.

357
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:48,420
-This case is which group?

358
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:03,330
The first thing we have to think is the remedies which she took before.

359
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:11,980
For which she had a positive reaction, were they correct, yes or no?

360
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,350
Should they have been taken, yes or no?

361
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:29,830
The remedies she took, Staphysagria, Lycopodium, Arnica...

362
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:43,490
-I took Staphysagria, Arnica and I think also Aconite before the operation,

363
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:51,910
a small dose, Lycopodium, Calc. carb., Nat. mur. and for the flu Arsenicum and Silica.

364
00:42:56,930 --> 00:43:01,370
For some colds I took sometimes Belladonna or Aconite.

365
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:09,290
-She says, she had a positive reaction from Staphysagria. What did you feel?

366
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:13,990
-I felt better psychologically because of the problems I had in the family.

367
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:16,500
So I could support them much better.

368
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,400
-Then you had a good reaction also from?

369
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:27,590
-Form Nat. mur. and after Lycopodium that rumbling disappeared.

370
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:34,810
-But you said you had an aggravation.
-Yes and in general was not good.

371
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:40,660
-So Staphysagria and Nat. mur.

372
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:49,920
You have here a case in which Staphysagria and Nat. mur. have acted.

373
00:43:50,020 --> 00:44:01,260
She felt better but did not touch deeper levels.

374
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:13,080
The fears did not change the substratum but definitely there was some grief

375
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:16,590
and that was taken away.

376
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:24,780
The question is at this moment if these 2 remedies were not given could we give

377
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:31,780
the next remedy now or maybe do we have to go again to Nat. mur. for instance

378
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:36,910
and prescribe straight away Nat. mur. and then continue.

379
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:45,150
We don't have the absolute control of the case but the most probable is according to

380
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:52,080
my understanding that both Staphysagria and Nat. mur. were a level of grief

381
00:44:52,180 --> 00:45:00,580
that was printed upon the level on which she has been living.

382
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:16,750
The incident with the operation brings out some fear which is deep inside

383
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:22,100
and makes a full blown case.

384
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:37,650
So according to my understanding this is a case that gets Staphysagria, Nat. mur.

385
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:47,510
and gets the next remedy, whatever it might be, so we discuss these 3 remedies.

386
00:45:49,750 --> 00:46:05,170
Actually she was born here and this was added like a cold.

387
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:20,140
These layers are almost like acutes that come on top of you and they don't give you

388
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:26,740
the same remedy because an acute can give you the same remedy, as Cal. carbonica.

389
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:33,090
Here it might be an acute and give Calc. carbonica and both these levels can just go away.

390
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:35,230
This is not the case.

391
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:44,910
We don't know of course if this was Sulphur and it was given Sulphur from the very beginning,

392
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:50,540
what would take? It would take care of this as well? Doubtful.

393
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:55,800
I think these remedies were really indicated.

394
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:59,740
I can not say now because they are gone it's history.

395
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:05,150
I don't know the details, how much salt she needed here, for instance.

396
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:08,340
I doubt whether it was a typical case.

397
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:24,750
Anyhow now we are in a position to go deeper in the analysis and find what is the indicated remedy.

398
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:38,240
What is it? Anybody wants to give me the reasons why he thinks is this or that remedy?

399
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:45,310
-When we look at the case and we look at the rubrics and compare them with her story

400
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:49,720
especially looking at all the fears that are present in her case,

401
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:53,750
I'm quite sure that this is a case of Calc. carbonica.

402
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:56,750
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

403
00:47:56,850 --> 00:47:59,110
-Very sure?
-Yes.

404
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:07,560
-Then why when she took Calc. carbonica never acted?

405
00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:15,670
-It could be, as you said, that a kind of shock was necessary to bring this remedy up

406
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:25,020
in the organism or it was so that the potency may have been too low.

407
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:32,510
-Good explanation. Anybody else is interested to speak?

408
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:36,600
-It's very interested for me that nobody spoke in favor of Phosphorus.

409
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:49,510
Show me the Repertorisation Margaret, you put so many symptoms.

410
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:51,430
Where is coming Phosphorus?

411
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:03,950
In spite of the fact that she mentions a lot of fears of Phosphorus,

412
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:09,010
even fear of thunderstorm, fear of dying.

413
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:18,510
-She sleeps on the left side.

414
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:37,930
-And how is her thirst? -Thirst less.
-Out.

415
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:45,720
-But nobody also spoke in favor of Conium. Why you left Conium out?

416
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:56,200
Vertigo turning in bed and if you concentrate in the vertigo area,

417
00:49:56,300 --> 00:50:08,730
if you are a keynote prescriber of a superficial prescriber, you give Conium and hope for the best.

418
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:16,700
-It's possible that she may be fainted due to pain and that was the reason why her soul left

419
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,040
the body before the anesthesia was completely acting.

420
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:26,440
-No, she was not aware really. She thought she was aware.

421
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:32,940
She could not hear anything, she could not feel pain, so what kind of awareness?

422
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:40,770
She thought she was aware. What happened actually was they injected the anesthesia

423
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:48,620
and then the etheric body started going out and was stuck on a place where it was dark.

424
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:56,310
She said, I was a dark point. This is a terrifying experience because many people

425
00:50:56,410 --> 00:51:06,020
have felt either due to injections or due to taking drugs, marihuana or LCD,

426
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:17,560
they are stuck in a place where it is very frightening. And she got a fright definitely.

427
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:22,620
She comes back and the fear remains.

428
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:35,520
That means with her in depth there was a fear of dying, a fear of death, that was the big issue,

429
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:40,790
that came up more strong after the experience with the anesthesia.

430
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:49,110
-The way she describes this, that she had been demanded or asked to breathe.

431
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:57,210
I estimate that they have been accident with anesthesia and she was actually on a point of dying.

432
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:04,410
Or it was a near death experience and that is why I suggest to give Aconite.

433
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:13,350
I wanted to support what my pre-speaker said. I have been in anesthesia for 8 years

434
00:52:13,450 --> 00:52:21,110
and my experience is that when the anestheologist lets the patient wake quicker

435
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:28,600
then the remedy you have given to make the muscle dysfunction,

436
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:34,350
then the patient experience a terrible fright.

437
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:41,930
One colleague of mine, an anestheologist too had experienced this, as patient

438
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:46,770
and he told me he couldn't imagine a more horrible fear than this.

439
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:54,930
You are in a state but you can't move but at the same time you are already conscious

440
00:52:55,030 --> 00:53:03,190
but you can't breathe. The doctor says breathe please, as a sign that they took out the tube

441
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:08,450
before it was already ready that the muscles would function again.

442
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:17,010
-That's correct, most probably they were trying for some time to get her out and

443
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:22,780
eventually as she was coming back into her body, she started hearing

444
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:29,620
but then it was not exact thing that you can move, like the "mora" state at night.

445
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:37,120
You may feel that, as the body goes out, you are awake but you can't move at all.

446
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:48,170
These experiences can be very frightening and these are experiences

447
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:52,020
which we go through death.

448
00:53:54,780 --> 00:54:05,800
I had a case 3 months in coma, 2 months in coma in America and 1 month in the hospital

449
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:11,800
and he was describing the experience of living, he was living.

450
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:22,050
And he said it was really terrifying. He said, I felt alone in the cosmos.

451
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:36,900
I was just a point where no connection with anything, it was all empty and I was there.

452
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:50,060
Can you imagine? Alone. Sometimes you are alone, you have this feeling of isolation

453
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:58,550
which is very deep and disturbing and you are here in the world, you can go out and

454
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:06,490
meet your dog, your cat. That's why we have dogs and cats, because we can connect.

455
00:55:08,650 --> 00:55:15,480
I have a very good cat, lots of animals.

456
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:19,380
-After my scientific colleagues is a different question.

457
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:24,640
I just heard from the colleague she said that she took Aconite before the operation.

458
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:29,880
So I would like to hear from you if there is in your observation a connection

459
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:34,900
with Aconite before the operation, with the operation?

460
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:40,150
-No, don't take a remedy if you don't have the symptoms of the remedy, that's the rule.

461
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:49,130
You go to the operation and you are terrified, I'm going to die, then you can take Aconite

462
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:51,130
and you will go more calm.

463
00:55:51,230 --> 00:55:57,380
You go to the operation without real fear of dying and you take Aconite,

464
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:04,060
the only thing you may do is just create the fear, create a proving.

465
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:14,090
Think the same way always. The remedy can act only when the symptoms are present.

466
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:27,100
-You are describing this fear of being alone in cosmos in Camphora in your Materia Medica.

467
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:42,190
-That's different. I'm talking about an after-death experience, here.

468
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:49,980
I don't know whether I gave him Opium and he started coming back and then

469
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:53,170
I gave him Sulphur and then things like that.

470
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:58,320
I'm talking about an experience he had, while he was out of his body, in coma.

471
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:04,160
Out of his body the fear was terrifying he says because I felt alone.

472
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:11,910
There was no entity. I was there and there was nobody and there was an empty space.

473
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:19,400
These experiences are frightening, terrifying etc. but they can leave no mark.

474
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:24,590
This case of mine left on mark on him, no trauma.

475
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:32,240
-She said after the death of the grandparents began discussion with dead and

476
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:40,170
it is a strong [?] but the interpretation about fear of death and  out of body experiences

477
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:46,640
I can not share because there is a lot of different reservations.

478
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:56,630
I had a terrible accident and the doctors said to my wife it's finished

479
00:57:56,730 --> 00:58:02,630
and my heart worked still I was 6 weeks later I was awakened.

480
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:09,730
I remember nothing of dark experiences.

481
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:20,050
-Sure, not everybody who has an experience comes back and has after effects.

482
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:25,640
This is what I say and this is confirming. There is no question about that.

483
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:37,310
What she is having is not absolutely and exclusively the result of this experience.

484
00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:38,820
Not at all.

485
00:58:47,070 --> 00:59:06,900
Who will prescribe Aconite? Who will prescribe Calcarea carb.?

486
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:43,990
Who will prescribe Cocculus? Nobody. Conium? Nobody. Cannabis Indica? 3.

487
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:52,480
That means there is another 18 people who did not vote.

488
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:56,250
They don't say anything.

489
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:11,980
Let me see the symptoms because I have to give you an explanation why I prescribed the remedy.

490
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:47,160
You put everything my god! Go further, let me see if you have the symptoms I'm looking for.

491
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:04,330
The symptom is not there, it doesn't matter.

492
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:18,590
-George one rubric that I put down is not there, ailments from anesthesia, Phosphorus.

493
01:01:19,830 --> 01:01:28,840
-This was when anesthesia was with chloroform. They don't do it anymore.

494
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:33,090
Do they give chloroform?
-No.

495
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:44,830
-This was the idea of Kent by that time and then he connected the two.

496
01:01:51,330 --> 01:01:56,830
Fear of thunderstorms is not there, only 1.

497
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:09,600
She said it in such a tone that I could not make it better, make it twice.

498
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:17,830
Calcarea will be stronger because Calcarea is in italics.

499
01:02:42,580 --> 01:02:48,330
It is my opinion that this is Calcarea carbonica, I will tell you why.

500
01:02:55,080 --> 01:03:07,730
Because we have the fears which they fit, fear of death, fear of insanity, of thunderstorms

501
01:03:07,830 --> 01:03:10,070
they fit with Calc. carb.

502
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:18,990
This might not be enough because they fit also or they are close with Aconitum and Phosphorus.

503
01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:23,490
So therefore we need some differential points.

504
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:27,490
Which are the differential points that you can say?

505
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:35,900
They are the cold feet, wearing shocks to get them warm and then during the night

506
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:44,560
she takes them out. We have said that repeatedly Calc. carbon. she said exactly this.

507
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:55,400
Then she said out of food, she stressed desire for sweets and then she said

508
01:03:55,500 --> 01:04:02,000
my feet sweat. Is it cold? Yes. Is it clammy? Yes.

509
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:12,890
So these are the points which confirm the fears plus the fact she is putting weight lately

510
01:04:12,990 --> 01:04:26,320
for the last years. Plus the vertigo from high places or fear, that was quite strong.

511
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:36,310
Plus the fact that she is a chilly person, I feel the cold.

512
01:04:39,810 --> 01:04:44,070
Where is the contradiction for Calc. carb.?

513
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:51,160
There is no contradiction but she took Calc. carb. 30. Nothing.

514
01:04:52,900 --> 01:05:01,060
I say ask the pharmacy what they have given instead of Calc. carbonica.

515
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:08,340
Most probably instead of Calc. carbonica she took nothing, she took placebo.

516
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:12,260
And that is what happens.

517
01:05:14,530 --> 01:05:21,160
-I think another strong symptom for Calcarea carb. because she said I'm a slow person

518
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:23,760
and I don't like to be pushed.

519
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:34,500
-You see with Phosphorus or Aconite you have to see much more the intensity of the fear.

520
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:40,840
The eyes, the fear is there.

521
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:47,490
And then Phosphorus and Aconite are much more fast.

522
01:05:50,590 --> 01:06:03,090
Therefore this is a typical case and she belongs actually to the uppermost group here.

523
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:09,170
Either uppermost second or first group. Low first group.

524
01:06:25,050 --> 01:06:30,900
-George I don't want to argue against Calc. carb. I just want to say about the sun.

525
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:37,760
I've written down here worse sun, must cover head in walking.

526
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:44,500
Put that in the Repertorisation. Find worse sun.

527
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:51,240
Do you have the symptom?
-Yes.

528
01:06:53,990 --> 01:07:01,490
-How strong you would like to put it?
-Put it 3 times.

529
01:07:10,170 --> 01:07:22,810
-It was already there.
-No change at all.

530
01:07:23,830 --> 01:07:29,580
You can not change because of this, it's OK sensitivity to the sun.

531
01:07:30,360 --> 01:07:36,660
It's already recorded in the provings that has a sensitivity to the sun.

532
01:07:37,650 --> 01:07:46,580
You don't change unless it is the whole case revolves around sun, then you change.

533
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:52,720
-George I have one question. The timidity appearing in public,

534
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:59,080
it's strong in Calcium silicata but it is in Calcium carbonicum, did you see it?

535
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:03,230
-In the Calcium carbonicum yes, it has a lot of timidity.

536
01:08:03,330 --> 01:08:04,730
-Appearing in public?

537
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:12,980
-Appearing in public is not to make you sick. Lycopodium will become sick.

538
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:20,740
They will have burning in the stomach and Gelsemium they will be trembling.

539
01:08:21,750 --> 01:08:30,560
They are sick. Calc. carb. is not so strong but it is there, timidity is there.

540
01:08:38,170 --> 01:08:44,310
So, no question that we have to prescribe Calc. carbon. for this case.

541
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:52,240
This case also now appears to be clear as Calc. carb. case.

542
01:08:54,000 --> 01:09:02,740
-If you look under the rubric vertigo when turning the head, Calcarea is there in 4th degree.

543
01:09:03,250 --> 01:09:06,230
If it was not there, would you have hesitance to prescribe Calcarea?

544
01:09:06,330 --> 01:09:08,080
-No, not at all.

545
01:09:10,330 --> 01:09:13,900
-This is the main complain.

546
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:21,540
-It doesn't matter, once the case is clear as a total case, forget the details.

547
01:09:21,640 --> 01:09:26,620
If you don't have a clear case and you have to treat only the details, then you pay attention.

548
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:34,370
But in this case even the vertigo fits, sleeps on the left side, look at it.

549
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:39,880
There are 4-5 remedies who say, I really like to sleep on the left side.

550
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:55,970
Magnesia, Calcarea, Bryonia...Calcarea is not there!

551
01:10:05,210 --> 01:10:09,790
No, in my Repertory I have Calcarea.

552
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:20,600
-... has added it.

553
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:36,460
-Who has added it?
-I have it also, you put it in.

554
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:50,950
-Yes, there is no question. Here it's missing. Left side twice, italics.

555
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:59,850
In my mind I can't remember, it's 40 years of doing all this.

556
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:07,540
If you see my Repertory, I have 5 Repertories, you see the oldest one the things

557
01:11:07,640 --> 01:11:14,770
are falling off and in this Repertory, the very first Repertory I had added Calcarea carbonica

558
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:18,870
since 35 years, sleeps on left side.

559
01:11:22,370 --> 01:11:31,120
Now I'm thinking this was originally there. I was sure originally was there.

560
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:38,010
-I, too, have Calcium carbonicum at first place when I repertorize but I was disturbed

561
01:11:38,110 --> 01:11:42,370
because it didn't have the clairvoyant dreams.

562
01:11:47,530 --> 01:11:57,680
-Clairvoyant dreams to be pathology, you have to have disturbing you.

563
01:11:57,780 --> 01:12:04,190
She saw perhaps 1 or 2 in her life. Everybody has clairvoyant dreams in this way.

564
01:12:04,290 --> 01:12:08,180
When everybody has, you don't pay attention.

565
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:11,530
The only difference is you don't pay very much attention.

566
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:20,430
I am the most clairvoyant, I see dreams all the time, this is going to happen and that.

567
01:12:20,530 --> 01:12:29,180
Forget it, because I pay attention. It's not a symptom to change the prescription.

568
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:34,190
Under no circumstances when you have a full case, you change it because you don't

569
01:12:34,290 --> 01:12:39,690
see clairvoyant dreams or dreams in general.

570
01:12:39,790 --> 01:12:48,670
This is not dreaming here, what we are doing. We try to be as much aware, as possible.

571
01:12:48,770 --> 01:12:56,280
Dreams is something. How many times I've used dreams in my prescribing?

572
01:12:57,540 --> 01:13:03,010
Maybe 2-3 times that I was led by a dream.

573
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:08,260
But when you prescribe thousands of case, I have prescribed at least 200.000 cases

574
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:11,950
personally, paper cases and live cases.

575
01:13:13,950 --> 01:13:22,700
And only 3 cases that it was confirmed, not even lead by a dream.

576
01:13:23,210 --> 01:13:29,940
What is this? This is nonsense and dangerous because you can be mislead.

577
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:35,180
You have a dream like this? You take that remedy. Forget it.

578
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:42,430
On the other hand it is good doing research, if it is serious research it is very good

579
01:13:42,530 --> 01:13:48,680
but don't confuse the issues and make something which is not serious,

580
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:51,770
serious and the serious one you just destroy.

581
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:09,860
-But we strongly confirm symptoms like dreams of falling Belladonna.

582
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:13,430
-Yes, that's where I would use it.

583
01:14:13,530 --> 01:14:20,660
I would use it in Thuja, I would ask do you dream falling and many times I would confirm

584
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:23,560
but not be lead by it.

585
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:29,840
That's what I say, it's few times that you will have that.

586
01:14:32,190 --> 01:14:37,250
Also in the Repertories is a lot of information which is useless.

587
01:14:37,350 --> 01:14:43,590
Do you know how difficult it is to take out an information or put it in an information

588
01:14:43,690 --> 01:14:46,920
before you know what you are doing?

589
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:56,270
You can not imagine how difficult it is to come to the decision this symptom is useless.

590
01:14:58,530 --> 01:15:06,590
We have to have Institutions, people researching and everybody's experience.

591
01:15:06,690 --> 01:15:11,500
Did you have and experience with this symptom? Nobody had it.

592
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:22,080
When there is seriously working all over the world, then we can start refining the Repertories.

593
01:15:22,180 --> 01:15:24,580
When you have reliable information.

594
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:33,820
Now everybody gets up, gives a case, when I read cases in Journals

595
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:42,820
"I was lead to prescribe by this dream and this dream of a tree growing and going up..."

596
01:15:43,490 --> 01:15:46,470
I say, why you tell lies?

597
01:15:46,570 --> 01:15:55,970
You prescribe this remedy because you found a keynote which was coldness of the abdomen

598
01:15:56,070 --> 01:16:01,130
and you prescribe Menyanthes and now you made a whole story and you say Menyanthes has this,

599
01:16:01,230 --> 01:16:04,650
trees falling up and down. No.

600
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:11,390
It is because you found a keynote and through the keynote you were lead to the remedy

601
01:16:11,490 --> 01:16:14,460
and then the person also had 1-2 dreams.

602
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:20,300
First of all, in order to take a dream into consideration, it has to be constant repeatedly.

603
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:26,300
That means it's a chemistry in the body which brings you, when you go to sleep in a

604
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:31,550
certain position, in the night, there is a chemistry.

605
01:16:31,650 --> 01:16:40,810
And the chemistry brings again and again a pattern and the pattern is depicted on a dream;

606
01:16:40,910 --> 01:16:45,220
then you have the dream every second day.

607
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:51,810
That is a very important dream. But to have a dream once or twice...

608
01:16:51,910 --> 01:16:59,650
I dreamt of snakes. Dreams of snakes you have to have it repeatedly.

609
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:05,720
Once everyone has seen dreams of snakes, at least one time in his life.

610
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:08,330
I have seen 5 times.

611
01:17:27,730 --> 01:17:40,900
-Which potency?
-Very high. 50M! OK 10M.
