1
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:29,090
To talk to you about the levels of health and to give you some ideas

2
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:33,430
about what they mean.

3
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:53,340
Why I came to the conclusion that the whole of humanity belongs not to one level of health

4
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,930
but to several levels of health.

5
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:14,090
So the whole of humanity is divided symbolically not exactly into 12 levels of health.

6
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:28,830
So according to my understanding a person is born in the 1st level of health

7
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:35,750
the uppermost which is the best and some others unfortunate

8
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:43,590
have been born in the 12th level of health, which is the worst.

9
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:58,570
In the 12th level of health who belong? Belong all these children who are born with cancer,

10
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:06,740
with severe systemic disorders, with epilepsy, with autism etc.

11
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:18,250
Once is born with such a pathology belongs to the 12th level of health,

12
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:31,760
to very low level of health. And you may ask what do we need to know

13
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,490
which level of health somebody is...

14
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:46,320
Well, it's very important to know because if we have a case

15
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:54,960
that belongs to level 10,11, 12 which is the last group

16
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:05,090
that means we have in our hands a case that most probably is incurable with Homeopathy.

17
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:22,660
As we go higher in the levels of health then individuals who are chronically ill

18
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:33,860
with degenerative diseases will not respond to one remedy.

19
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:43,520
You may need a series of remedies before you can bring them higher and higher

20
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,640
in the level of health.

21
00:03:47,680 --> 00:04:05,240
Therefore severely damaged constitutions they will respond partially to your first remedy

22
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:13,930
then the picture of another remedy manifests you give this comes up the organism a bit more,

23
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:26,110
a third remedy, a forth remedy  you may need before within a space of time 3-5 years

24
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:36,260
of treatment then you may say I have managed to cure such a person.

25
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:57,150
The problem with us homeopaths is that some people some of us we see cases

26
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:07,240
responding very well with one remedy and the confusion is that we get the impression

27
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:16,250
that all cases could respond in this way to the extent

28
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:28,160
for instance one of the Argentinian doctors you have to find the core remedy,

29
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,160
everybody has the core remedy.

30
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:42,500
This does not exist, because if an individual is going to be cured with one 1-5 remedies

31
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:50,710
in a space of time of 3-5 years, then you cannot say the core remedy,

32
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:55,990
out of the five which was the core remedy...?

33
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:07,510
But if you find patients that belong to the uppermost levels 1,2,3 strong constitutions

34
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:18,080
born with genetic predisposition to live for 90 years, then to such individuals

35
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:23,850
you may give one remedy and they respond beautifully.

36
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:33,580
But you can imagine now the confusion that we can cause to the world by saying

37
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:40,330
we cure this whatever pathology, because we have seen one or two cases cured.

38
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:51,100
Because they belong to the first group. But what is the peculiarity

39
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:56,060
and why this confusion has come?

40
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:15,760
Because in all levels we may have the manifestation of all pathologies.

41
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:27,890
That means we have a cancer case appearing in level 1-3, the best,

42
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:32,320
which we call the first group, which is the best group.

43
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:39,650
We may have manifestation in first group.

44
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:52,840
We have manifestation of cancer in group 2 which is level 4,5 and 6.

45
00:07:52,940 --> 00:08:00,330
We may have cancer manifesting in group 3 7,8,9.

46
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:13,740
So what is the difference? The difference is that cancer on the 1st group is curable.

47
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:24,050
Cancer on level 1,2,3 individuals is curable. And we have seen some cases of cancer cured,

48
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,660
"oh we cure cancer...".

49
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:38,860
We don't cure cancer because cancer on level 7,8,9 if it manifests

50
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:50,220
that means it will be an aggressive type of cancer that will be exploding

51
00:08:50,320 --> 00:09:00,220
that means within months you will have metastasis and the person dies.

52
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,320
And nothing can save him, not homeopathy not allopathy, nothing.

53
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:21,990
But cancer on the uppermost levels even can be cured as when the individual

54
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:34,660
changes his psychology and his immune system is activated. Why?

55
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:43,630
Because he realizes the life I'm living is very unhealthy.

56
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:48,490
So I change altogether my style of life.

57
00:09:50,240 --> 00:10:01,070
The moment they take this decision to go away from the stress of life, which is tremendous...

58
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:21,670
The cases I am bringing as examples are real cases. Working emigrated in USA

59
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:32,160
and became rich with a lot of supermarkets and all this kind of stress.

60
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:43,400
And at the age of 60 go to the doctor say "I have bad news for you sir.

61
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:58,890
You have cancer on the mediastinum and the prognosis is quite bad".

62
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:11,400
He goes back, has his family there, he says "How long I have to live?

63
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:27,130
-You may live 6 months...more...". He said "Ok, 6 months I want to go back to my island

64
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:33,390
to live 6 months there. My last days...".

65
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:43,060
He was given now an interview to Greek television.

66
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:59,470
He says "In 1985 I came here, now it's 2005, 20 years later he is 79,

67
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:04,110
because they told me I have 6 months to live."

68
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:09,680
Go to  another individual who is the case..." I was told to  live this, this...

69
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:18,680
I came back here and here I am 15 years later, I am quite strong, my life has changed..."

70
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:38,720
So, we have to understand that the secret is that the organism has a defense mechanism.

71
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:50,860
We call it immune system which is being suppressed, until compromises

72
00:12:50,960 --> 00:13:00,080
and the predispositions that are engrafted are manifesting suddenly.

73
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:08,590
If the predisposition was for rheumatoid arthritis he will develop rheumatoid arthritis.

74
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:19,330
One guy, he wrote a book in America. He wrote a book, he says "I had rheumatoid arthritis.

75
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:32,240
I was an industrialist with huge money etc. and they told me I'm going to be deformed now.

76
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:46,160
So, I gave up my job and what I did I started laughing. Here I am 10 years later

77
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:56,010
I am still laughing, not deformities and I am quite good because I was laughing.

78
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:03,670
You see we have to take into consideration this. I tell you this

79
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:14,150
because it is very much connected with what we are doing in stimulating the immune system

80
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:22,830
with the homeopathic remedy.  Similar things happen when you change the psychology,

81
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:31,630
the environment, the conditions. The organism suddenly flourishes,

82
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:37,850
the immune systems comes into balance and then faces the problem.

83
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:54,740
But you will say if somebody has a strong constitution and belongs to the uppermost group

84
00:14:54,840 --> 00:15:01,170
how come and he can develop cancer from one day to another?

85
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:20,740
The answer is that if the stress they receive overweights the resistance of the immune system,

86
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:31,680
the stress is very big, the immune system compromises totally then it can appear.

87
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:43,470
I will give you an example from real life. I was teaching in Athens a group of medical doctors.

88
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:54,550
One of the doctors works in a hospital, chest hospital. He brings a case for discussion.

89
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:58,510
What is the remedy, because we have a case in the hospital

90
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:02,490
and who is coughing, coughing, coughing.

91
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:20,220
And these are the symptoms of the persons the man is 75, 73. Old man.

92
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:35,720
Older than me I am only 78 now. But anyhow, the fact is that he brings me the case,

93
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:46,130
he gives me the information, he is coughing and I say to him "Peter,

94
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:58,800
what happened and he suddenly a man who is a villager, a farmer in a small place in Greece

95
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:06,820
where people are healthy... What happened? Why? Something has happened."

96
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:25,060
He said this man had an illegal affair - he was married and he has grandchildren -

97
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:33,680
with a woman from the area who is also married with some children.

98
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:46,710
Suddenly this becomes known to the whole of the village and the stress of this man

99
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:57,410
is so great that he does not know anymore where to hide himself from everybody gossiping.

100
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:10,660
He was discovered suddenly to have this illegal affair. The shock for him is tremendous.

101
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:25,240
So, I said "Peter, you have to be careful because this is a case of cancer",

102
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:29,160
he says "Why do you say that?",

103
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:40,810
I said "Because the stress for such a man at this age and the symptomatology coughing

104
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:45,510
this means he has developed cancer of the lungs".

105
00:18:47,900 --> 00:19:00,980
The fact is that my student has brought this case to me to check me

106
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:10,630
because I would say "Give Sulphur" and then he would go to the next room

107
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:19,490
where he left his bag with the x-rays and he would say "Teacher it was a case of cancer

108
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:25,230
and you did not recognize it. You are treating it as a common cough.

109
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:35,730
But he opened the mouth like that and he said "Why?" and I explained why I said that.

110
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:39,390
Don't cough and give me the idea that...

111
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:59,270
Why I was able to make a correct diagnosis?

112
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:05,930
Because I knew what I am trying to pass you as information right now.

113
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:12,620
That is does not matter how healthy an individual can be.

114
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:22,690
Once the the stress is great the manifestation of a severe degenerative condition

115
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:34,180
may manifest from one day to the other. But what is the difference?

116
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:45,460
That his cancer was cured. Because he presented a case of clear Sulphur.

117
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:55,160
And his case was curable because if the same thing was happening

118
00:20:55,260 --> 00:21:08,430
in an individual of group 7,8,9 lower groups then by the time we were talking

119
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:21,020
he would already have a metastasis. So another example, I will give you.

120
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:40,860
Here where I live I had an old man about 70-72 he was my gardener I had noticed

121
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:50,850
that he had Parkinson because as soon as he got excited he would go like this,

122
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,430
his hands would go like that.

123
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:07,180
One day he comes and tells me "I hurt my finger. Can you give me a remedy for my finger?"

124
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:11,580
and I said "Ok, I will give you a remedy for the finger".

125
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:20,940
But he is farmer he doesn't pay attention. Everybody accepts, he's an old man...

126
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:24,590
What to ask...

127
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:37,680
But I had noticed that every time the man was coming he was so dirty in his clothes.

128
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:45,180
Sometimes I thought he had urinated his pants and he didn't care.

129
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:58,820
So I said ok this is a case of Sulphur. Because I knew certain other things for instance

130
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:06,500
he would eat the sweets and every time he would ask for tsipouro, tequila.

131
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:15,250
He needed some tequila, he eats sweets, he was dirty.

132
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:29,740
This is characteristic of Sulphur.  The lower jaw it goes like that. I didn't ask a question.

133
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:36,070
I'll give a remedy for your finger. I gave him Sulphur 200.

134
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:47,180
And within one week he comes and I see for the first time he has washed his clothes,

135
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,170
he comes and he is with clean clothes...

136
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:10,230
Now, a German television comes here and come to my house to show to the German people

137
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:12,670
George Vithoulkas what is doing and all that.

138
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:19,590
And there is my gardener and I tell them the story of the gardener,

139
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:35,250
and they see the gardener etc... This documentary was played in Germany 7 times.

140
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:43,270
Every time it was played I was receiving thousands of letters from Parkinson people

141
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:46,090
asking for treatment.

142
00:24:47,840 --> 00:25:00,430
Of course some of them may belong to the group 1, but who? All the others... forget it.

143
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:08,010
We may improve a little bit but forget the cure of such people.

144
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:20,280
So the idea of the levels of health it became for me very important

145
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:31,930
and when I wrote my book "The Science of Homeopathy"- I wrote the book in 1976

146
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:38,600
and two years after it was published 1978 -

147
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:46,020
I put this idea of the levels of health without giving more information

148
00:25:46,120 --> 00:26:00,020
because before I say something I want to be sure that it is so...

149
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:09,200
And only in 1995 when this school was established here I started giving the information

150
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:19,220
about the levels of health because there are some characteristics

151
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,240
about these levels of health.

152
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:42,800
Which are the characteristics? As you go down the scale and the pathology

153
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:52,150
becomes deeper and more serious you will have to lower the potency.

154
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:01,640
That means in the highest groups you can give high potencies,

155
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:09,910
no problem 1M, 10M, 50M, no problem.

156
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:18,800
But as the pathology becomes more and more you have to lower the potency.

157
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:30,440
You go to 200, you go to 30, you go to 12, you go even lower than 12, 12X

158
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:41,810
and when in the uppermost group one high potency may be enough in the lower groups

159
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,410
you have to repeat.

160
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:55,050
There is so much confusion if you do not understand these levels of health.

161
00:27:55,150 --> 00:28:06,320
So much confusion about such low/ high potencies, repetitions etc.

162
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:17,640
Because some homeopaths have noticed that if I repeat the case goes very well

163
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:29,440
and then makes it a rule for every case.  What happens? Ok, I will explain it to you.

164
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:32,510
I may go to details but maybe it is important.

165
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:43,910
What happens is that when you give a remedy on higher groups

166
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:48,670
you give a shock to the immune system, you trigger the immune system

167
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:58,520
and after that the immune system comes back and starts doing the work, curing the person.

168
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:10,070
Once you have power in the immune system you will not have to stimulate it again

169
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:21,240
because the moment you stimulated it already you changes the vibrational rate

170
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:24,280
of the immune system.

171
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:29,570
So when you repeat it later on, after a week or two weeks

172
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:38,740
the vibrational state of the immune system is not there. It has changed already.

173
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:46,620
But in case the immune system is very weak you have to stimulate it

174
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,930
again and again and again...

175
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:58,000
Strong immune system; you stimulate it once, you leave it,  you wait.

176
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:06,500
You can wait for 1 year and you will see the patient is doing better and better.

177
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:14,320
But you go down and you give one remedy and you see in one week

178
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:18,080
there is back everything.

179
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:23,670
In such cases you need repetition, constant repetition.

180
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:32,830
So you see how important it is to know what are you treating.

181
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:37,330
What is the pathology really behind.

182
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:59,030
Is it possible?  So, another thing that you have to pay attention is...

183
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:14,150
You get a case with ulcerative colitis and you treat such case

184
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:18,910
and with one remedy the person comes back.

185
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:28,400
You have another case of ulcerative colitis and you need 3 years of correct treatment

186
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:41,510
before you can bring back such a case. So, what is the difference?

187
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:53,140
The difference is first on the genetic predisposition or there is another factor

188
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:07,860
which is how much a person who was born with genetic predisposition very high, very good,

189
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:18,100
how much he has damaged himself through wrong living, wrong medication,

190
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:29,350
a lot of medication, a lot of drugs, all kinds of drugs, alcohol too much, smoking a lot.

191
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:38,420
The level of such a person comes to a point when he comes to you

192
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:49,260
and says now he has arteritis because of too much smoke and drinking etc.

193
00:32:53,270 --> 00:33:03,350
These cases that have been damaged through wrong living and wrong treatments

194
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:15,310
can respond much better than cases that genetically belong to low levels.

195
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:28,380
For instance, you will see children born with parents with very good health.

196
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:36,350
How old is your father? 85. How old is your father? 95.

197
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:40,720
And he is 65 and he has heart problem.

198
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:47,320
That means he has damaged his life because he comes with a very good predisposition

199
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:51,310
but does not pay attention to his own health.

200
00:33:51,410 --> 00:34:00,970
Such persons he says "I had a heart infract or whatever damage in heart",

201
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:08,330
such a person will respond very well to the treatment.

202
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:18,390
But if you have another person with the same symptomatology. Your when he died? 65.

203
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:21,390
From what? Heart infract. Your mother?

204
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:29,680
My mother was psychotic and she had to go to the asylum etc.

205
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:34,870
He comes to you with heart problems.

206
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:39,720
It's going to be very difficult to cure and it's going to take a long time

207
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:43,440
because the predisposition is bad.

208
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:56,310
In such cases you will have to struggle but is most important in which

209
00:34:56,410 --> 00:35:05,220
nobody pays attention is that you have to find first the correct remedy,

210
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:13,320
you have to find the time for the second remedy, to give it in time correct again,

211
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:17,560
the third time to give it correct...

212
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:25,380
That means in such an individual you will have indication of 3 different remedies,

213
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:32,380
they pop up their symptoms. You will have to give Ignatia first,

214
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,680
but some symptoms of Sulphur are manifesting as well.

215
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:41,150
Is it Sulphur or Ignatia?

216
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:48,110
And you have to decide which is the first remedy that you must start the case

217
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:51,480
in order the case progresses properly.

218
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:58,800
Otherwise you give Sulphur which is second remedy, you give it as first,

219
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:05,680
you have partial results and then try to give another remedy Calcarea

220
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:11,730
and then another and another and then you have forgotten the picture of Ignatia in lost.

221
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,490
You don't have it anymore.

222
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:23,930
Then somebody else comes who is more expert and says "No, the first remedy is Ignatia.

223
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:30,470
Give Ignatia" and the case becomes coming in order.

224
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:40,160
And then the picture of Sulphur is manifesting. Give Sulphur now and then Calcarea.

225
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:49,070
I'll tell you now the big secret about these levels of health.

226
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:52,110
Now the big secret is coming.

227
00:36:55,580 --> 00:37:09,090
The peculiar thing is that in the uppermost level of health people can develop high fever.

228
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:24,460
Like most of the children. You see with tonsillitis, 40C, 39,5C... This is a good sign.

229
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,670
It's a sign the immune system is working properly.

230
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:36,460
Now what happens with mostly Western population, with Europeans,

231
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:45,740
with Americans with Canadians and this degenerated group of people.

232
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:52,800
Spain is also within this group. What happens?

233
00:37:52,900 --> 00:38:03,210
Once a degenerative chronic condition begins there in no possibility for the organism

234
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:07,820
to develop a high fever.

235
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:21,300
So when you have a case in front of you and ask "when did you have your last high fever?

236
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:26,320
-I don't remember...maybe 10-12 years ago".

237
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:33,320
That was the time when his chronic condition has started.

238
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:48,960
Because once the chronic condition crosses and threshold after that the organism,

239
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:56,710
the immune system is busy with keeping up a balance.

240
00:38:56,810 --> 00:39:02,210
He does not care about microbes, viruses.

241
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:16,240
That is why you will see in the flu epidemics who is getting the high fever?

242
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:27,080
Only the strong organisms. Those with degeneration they are protected.

243
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:38,990
Even if they do whatever to get high fever it's not possible for them.

244
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:54,140
So therefore in epidemic in 1950, 100 years ago almost, with the Spanish flu,

245
00:39:54,240 --> 00:40:01,900
where there supposed to be 20.000.000 people dead, pandemic.

246
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:11,730
They show in the end that only the young and the strong where infected.

247
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:17,740
It's recorded in all scientific books.

248
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:25,080
The old and the infirmary, those who were suffering, they were spared.

249
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:35,950
This model explains why such thing happened.

250
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:49,810
And the conventional medicine do not still understand this very simple truth

251
00:40:49,910 --> 00:41:00,450
and they say those who are in danger are those who are suffering

252
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:04,100
and you have to be vaccinated.

253
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:11,810
This means I am already very bad and I am vaccinated and I go to hell...

254
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:18,020
Because if such people are vaccinated they're going definitely

255
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,420
to have side-effects from vaccination.

256
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:30,190
Because you force upon the organism something which is foreign. You see the madness.

257
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:50,780
An individual is having a heart problem but his immune condition and belongs to group 3.

258
00:41:54,780 --> 00:42:03,170
He is in danger of getting high fever with his heart in a bad condition.

259
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:11,530
You see the explanation how clear it is.
