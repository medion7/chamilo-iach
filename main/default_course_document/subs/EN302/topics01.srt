1
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:37,670
For this time I have a secret theory, which maybe it will be useful to discuss

2
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:44,510
concerning the birth of healthy children.

3
00:00:52,520 --> 00:01:00,170
What are the conditions for a child to be born healthy?

4
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:19,390
I believe that this is a problem with the contemporary society.

5
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:47,800
And I think that the western population is going towards a degeneration.

6
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:58,540
One of the main reasons I believe that children are not born healthy anymore

7
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:05,550
or at least there is a small percentage of children born healthy.

8
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,790
The children are born with missing parts.

9
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:28,100
Not all of them they have what we call teratogenesis, missing a hand or an ear

10
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:37,860
but also from emotional and mental point of view, they are born with missing qualities

11
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,330
of these levels.

12
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:58,130
Why is that? I'll give you my theory which I hope it will be confirmed later on.

13
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:16,830
All the cells of the body they follow a general state in which we are at a particular moment.

14
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:35,530
Here is a cell and the state in which we can be is a state of excitation or depression.

15
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:53,040
So all the time the organism is either in a state of excitation or in a state of depression.

16
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:06,060
The more healthy we are, the more we have moments of quietness,

17
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:20,840
where the cells are in a state of non-activity but not in a state of not functioning.

18
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:37,020
There is functioning, there is dynamism but there is neither excitation, nor depression.

19
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:45,360
In these moments of quietness, these are the most important phases of the cells.

20
00:04:47,370 --> 00:05:04,850
Why? Because in these phases there is a possibility to perceive or to conceive.

21
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:12,690
Perceive ideas.

22
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:23,530
The moment that your mind goes quiet, these are the moments new ideas are born.

23
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:45,920
Therefore the organism has been programmed by nature to conceive, to perceive during

24
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,950
moments of total quietness.

25
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,440
What means total quietness?

26
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:14,290
It means a moment during which no factor external or internal affects the cells of the body.

27
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:24,580
The cells are like relaxing.

28
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:35,430
We can put in these states, there is another state which is the state of sleep,

29
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:53,070
in which there is little paramorphosis on the cells. Let's examine what brings these states.

30
00:06:53,170 --> 00:07:05,070
You will be able to understand in the end the issue and advise your clients

31
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:11,880
and give them correct advise but from a position of knowledge.

32
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:21,250
You say don't get drunk when you make a conception.

33
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,660
You will see it's much more than this to have a health child.

34
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:34,750
It takes much more than don't take drugs or don't drink alcohol.

35
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:43,570
It is something which is much more, it is something which is conception of an idea

36
00:07:43,670 --> 00:08:01,410
or conception of a new child is a magical moment of creation.

37
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:14,890
We become like creators, little gods if I'm permitted to use such expression.

38
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:25,390
So therefore in order to be a little god, prepared to bring a child into the world,

39
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:30,990
you will have to be prepared properly.

40
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:47,650
So excitation or depression comes from two main factors, external and internal.

41
00:08:50,080 --> 00:09:11,070
External factors are drugs of any type, prescription or non prescription drugs.

42
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:25,990
The second external factor in which we live is pollution.

43
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:51,990
And the third external factor in which we have to be aware today is what?

44
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,990
Let me see if you are thinking.

45
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:17,230
Radio waves, waves, radio, TV, cellular phones, antennas etc.

46
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:35,460
These three factors force our organism to be in a state of either excitation or depression.

47
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:44,100
These three factors are becoming more and more widely spread today,

48
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:54,600
they are used by more and more by people and these two factors are very much imposed

49
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,700
upon everyone of us.

50
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:12,450
The more we live in cities, the more we are subjected to such pollutions.

51
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:29,010
Maybe the people who live in high mountains or in far away areas are less affected

52
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:32,370
by this kind of situation.

53
00:11:43,120 --> 00:12:05,830
Looking at this issue, the internal pollution, what can excite us or depress us mostly?

54
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:14,090
The main ideas? Look at inside yourselves and you will find out.

55
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:20,090
What is bothering you most?

56
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:39,510
-Inner restlessness.
-Loss of inner balance.

57
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:49,680
-Love life.
-Fear of any kind.

58
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:58,340
-More or less you stated, I will put it in a different way.

59
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,840
The first is insecurity.

60
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:12,760
We have created societies in which we have created insecurity for ourselves.

61
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,840
Nobody is secure anymore.

62
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:25,920
Can you imagine somebody being totally secure? No.

63
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:40,920
There are robbers, there are some people who may take your money, your property...

64
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:51,590
We have created a state of insecurity, which is almost constant.

65
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,670
We feel insecure.

66
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:10,750
That state will definitely affect the cells and will not allow phase 1 to be prevalent.

67
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:18,670
Rather phase 2 and 3 are the most prevalent.

68
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:26,330
The organism in a state of excitation or in a state of depression.

69
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:39,560
Exactly the same condition is followed by every cell of the human body and remember.

70
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:54,590
When there is conception both organisms are giving out live cells

71
00:14:54,690 --> 00:15:05,920
that can have the possibility of coming together and creating a new born child.

72
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,660
Live cells.

73
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:22,980
We discard cells which are dead but during this function,

74
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:31,090
you discharge live cells in a condition.

75
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:43,400
Which is the condition and what happens during this meeting of one cell with the other,

76
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,010
the sperm with the ovum? What happens?

77
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:51,590
There is a miracle that happens.

78
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:59,890
The question is can the miracle happen when cells are in a state of excitation

79
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:09,980
or depression or can the miracle happen when the cells are in a phase of quietness?

80
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:16,480
Dynamic quietness, not apathy.

81
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:36,490
The second internal pollution that we create for ourselves is conflict.

82
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:46,800
Is it good to have sex or not good? Is it good to go there? Is it correct this or that?

83
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:54,640
Is it possible to do this or it is not possible? Socially possible?

84
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,630
How many times to have sex? Three times the week or three times the day?

85
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:07,890
All these are conflicts in which we are impeding ourselves all the time

86
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,900
and the biggest conflict is the fear of death.

87
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:27,490
There are the three big issues

88
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:45,640
in which we are affecting the cells of the body.

89
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,120
Think and observe.

90
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:18,630
This kind of pollution is it usual for people living in the mountains of Venezuela

91
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:25,980
or this is a state which is usual with people living in New York?

92
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,980
-Or Athens?

93
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:43,240
-Thank you for the correction. Los Angeles actually is best.

94
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:50,980
This is a state in which we have brought ourselves.

95
00:18:51,080 --> 00:19:02,230
As a result we have a state in which women cannot conceive.

96
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:18,630
The problem of conception is becoming bigger and bigger in our western societies.

97
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:23,080
The problem of conception is tremendous at the moment.

98
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:29,770
And what is the advice that we give? Don't go pollution, don't go there

99
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:33,540
but still some conceptions are happening.

100
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:44,940
The question is these conceptions which are happening are complete conceptions

101
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:53,120
or they are teratogenesis? This is a question.

102
00:19:53,890 --> 00:20:03,060
The gynecologist looks on the monitor and says your child is OK

103
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:07,770
because the hands are there, the nose and the eyes.

104
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:14,210
What about the other qualities of that human being which is going to be born?

105
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:25,690
Is he going to be missing the possibility to think, the possibility to discriminate,

106
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:35,090
the possibility to love, the possibility to exchange with others?

107
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:53,030
Is he going to be a kind of a monster not outside but inside? Born monster?

108
00:20:54,030 --> 00:21:05,030
We hear of events where somebody took a gun and killed, just killed a child.

109
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:15,270
10 people, 20 people and you say what is going on in this world?

110
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:25,020
We are interested, we are investigating, we are thinking what is the real problem?

111
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:34,450
Maybe there is a possibility to correct the situation. What are these possibilities?

112
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,780
What shall we do? Can we do something?

113
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:55,520
We will reach conclusion, you will see very strange conclusions for the society

114
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,900
in which we live.

115
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:14,750
What I want you to understand is the phase of quietness.

116
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:23,010
I don't know how many of you, you have studied mathematics

117
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:29,930
and you have to solve the problem in mathematics and you battle?

118
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:40,340
At a certain moment, because you cannot solve the problem, there is a total quietness,

119
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:48,510
giving up and at this moment the solution comes. This is the mechanism of Creation.

120
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:01,690
Why? I want you to understand why.

121
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:15,180
Because at this moment there is no interference from these factors.

122
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:21,360
These factors for a split of a moment have been forgotten.

123
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:27,860
I must solve the problem, otherwise I will not pass the examination,

124
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:40,800
the insecurity and the fear. These factors will interfere for the creation of a new idea.

125
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:54,280
-You say that conflict is like a struggle. The minute that you give up,

126
00:23:54,380 --> 00:24:02,470
you gain enlightenment?
-Yes correct, we'll go there.

127
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:16,880
Therefore in order to create we must not interfere.

128
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:21,080
That is the first thing we must understand.

129
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:32,040
But who creates? We are the creators but there is something else,

130
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:40,640
which interferes with the whole process, which each one calls it according to his religion,

131
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:49,130
calls it god or Mohamed or Allah.

132
00:24:52,370 --> 00:25:01,350
There is another factor unknown, X-factor which has to be entering into the picture

133
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:12,130
in order to have a complete concept, that means a perception of an idea which is true.

134
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:26,130
There are a lot of ideas conceived by people but many of them have the sperm of disease.

135
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:36,050
They are not total ideas, they are not complete ideas and that is why these ideas can

136
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:44,890
also produce evil, can produce negative things.

137
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:09,630
Another condition in which your organism is in total quietness

138
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:18,390
is what the yogis try to attend. To quieten their mind.

139
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:26,940
They say the moment you quieten your mind something happens and they call it enlightenment.

140
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:40,400
Enlightened means a state in which you give up your own thoughts and ideas

141
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:50,630
and you are united with a state of consciousness which is much higher.

142
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:58,300
And then there is creation of life inside.

143
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:08,270
Why people try to get that state? That state of enlightenment is a state of complete bliss,

144
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:10,450
knowledge and bliss.

145
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:21,110
It's total bliss, total understanding. You are complete.

146
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:29,270
You feel you don't need any more the advice of somebody, the help of somebody.

147
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:33,920
All this is gone and you are complete.

148
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:44,390
These are very rare moments in which the organism overcomes the phase 2

149
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:55,290
and the phase 3 and gets into the phase 1, which is the phase of total quietness.

150
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:10,020
During this phase, if a conception takes place during this phase nr 1

151
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:25,290
and this happens from both parties, then you have the most possible healthy child.

152
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:33,580
Without missing qualities, without missing organs.

153
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:54,140
Nature has found a way to overcome these insecurities, conflicts and excitations.

154
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:03,120
That's why conception cannot take place so easily anymore now.

155
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:09,620
Because these phases are less and less.

156
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:27,030
Which is the way that nature has found to make you come to the phase 1,

157
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:39,480
without you doing anything mentally or emotionally? Making a trick.

158
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:51,520
My impression is that all scientists at this moment try to trick nature.

159
00:29:51,620 --> 00:30:03,870
They will say eventually we could produce a human being without the participation.

160
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:14,860
But we will see now how difficult it will be such an endeavor and how dangerous.

161
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:22,480
So nature has found a way to bring you in a state of phase 1.

162
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:29,700
Nature has found 'eros', the Greek word is 'eros'.

163
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,290
In English they call it falling in love.

164
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:55,610
Nature has found a way to bring you to that state of total satisfaction,

165
00:30:55,710 --> 00:31:06,700
complete relaxation, which comes when two people are in love.

166
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:19,630
They so much love each other that they lose themselves and they want to be united

167
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:29,620
with the other person to such a degree that they totally lose their individuality.

168
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:40,520
As an individual you don't exist, you exist in a communion with the other person.

169
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:54,440
That state has a culmination, what we call the orgasm.

170
00:31:55,940 --> 00:32:10,340
There is this state of excitement and loss of individuality, loss of egotistical element

171
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:24,430
which is in you and then comes a moment that you discharge the live cells from your body.

172
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:31,050
You let these life cells out in order to be united.

173
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:38,480
These cells are in the state of most satisfaction.

174
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,090
That means they don't need anything else.

175
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:58,440
You have experienced everyone of you the feeling of a love, a real love affair

176
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:08,700
that ends into a complete completion.

177
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:22,190
The cells that are coming out are in exactly the state in which the individuals

178
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:29,030
are at the moment of the discharge, at the moment of the orgasm.

179
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,630
Otherwise you could not reach phase 1.

180
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:44,570
You would be either in the state of insecurity or depression or whatever.

181
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:59,000
Can we have a conception under this state or that state? We will examine.

182
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:08,470
What I want you to understand is how important it is when you have a child.

183
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:16,380
You don't have a child by just going Mr... can you come in bed with me,

184
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:21,470
so I can have a child with you. You can have a child perhaps.

185
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:33,550
But this child is going to be missing certain organs, certain qualities of the soul,

186
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:45,470
of the spirit. It will not be a complete creation for the good of the planet.

187
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:53,200
It will be somebody who is missing certain parts.

188
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:05,720
That's why you get patients who say I can never feel this or I have never felt that.

189
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:24,130
A lot of women never felt the enjoyment of orgasm, of love.

190
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,860
They say what is this? I don't know.

191
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:44,210
Sometimes we can correct this by giving Sepia, Lilium tigrinum, Aurum etc.

192
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:51,030
But you will see also the very interesting phenomenon because I have been observing

193
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:57,370
this situation for many years since the beginning of my practice.

194
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:06,280
Women or men will come with sterility.

195
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:16,740
You give a remedy and within the next few days there is conception.

196
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:26,650
Because, as you know, the moment that you give the homeopathic remedy,

197
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:34,150
maybe there is an aggravation but immediately there is a phase 1 state

198
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:39,310
in which the individual says I feel so good.

199
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:51,400
I feel so good, it is when the cells are in a phase of perception.

200
00:36:52,410 --> 00:37:02,170
They are ready to perceive ideas, feelings or to conceive.

201
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:07,560
The moment you are balancing...

202
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:13,980
That is why Ignatia many times will be one of the remedies

203
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:18,070
that you will be using for sterility.

204
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:24,990
You give Ignatia and the next month the woman is pregnant.

205
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:30,420
It is very strange because for years she could not, because the anxiety was inside.

206
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:35,110
Shall I conceive or shall I not conceive?

207
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:47,190
So the homeopathic remedy actually creates the conditions in the body through

208
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:59,780
this balancing which brings suddenly for the body to conceive and to conceive correctly.

209
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:24,190
You may understand how incorrectly the medical world have understood

210
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:30,850
the problem of sterility. They say OK we'll solve it.

211
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:46,750
We'll do artificial dissemination and sometimes it is effective, sometimes it's not effective.

212
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:53,190
Sometimes is yes, sometimes is no. Most of the times is no. Why?

213
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:55,290
Because of that state.

214
00:38:56,270 --> 00:39:05,620
The woman is not in a state of phase 1 by the time they do the dissemination.

215
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:16,990
Even if they wanted to use this method, they should bring the woman into phase 1

216
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:23,590
and during that time they should do it in order to have an effect.

217
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:32,500
But this state is not brought so easily because of disease

218
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:44,100
and that is why the homeopathic remedy balancing the body, it can bring about an effect.

219
00:39:55,930 --> 00:40:01,180
It can be understood why we cannot overcome nature.

220
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:16,240
The things that we have learned from our history as human race were correct ideas

221
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:22,110
that we discarded by scientific thinking.

222
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:28,840
We are clever, we will find out, we will do this, we will do that...

223
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:35,830
By doing this we have rejected ideas that came from the past,

224
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:40,930
which are necessary for the regeneration of the human race.

225
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:45,830
Because if you have conceptions under that state or that state,

226
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:52,180
you will have constant losing of qualities in the human being.

227
00:40:52,650 --> 00:41:04,610
I cannot do that, I cannot do that and then the race is finished.

228
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:18,370
And they were some facts of life, which we totally ignore and one of the facts is this.

229
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:32,260
Falling in love really. Who is falling in love? Do you think many people fall in love?

230
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:37,420
It is a particular state that maybe the individual must come.

231
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,370
You think that you fall in love.

232
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:45,950
Maybe you don't fall in love because in the back of their mind there is a reservation.

233
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:58,160
Shall I get hurt? I like this man but let me hold back a little bit of myself.

234
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:06,270
These ideas have been promoted more and more and have become the norm in the society

235
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:14,240
I'm not sure that the example I give you is correct.

236
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:21,920
But when we see the American model, it is very interesting.

237
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:26,280
The American model it is depicted in their films.

238
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:33,170
You see the film and you see the couples and what is accepted is...

239
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:47,910
I love you and suddenly one of the two says where did you put my shoes?

240
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:54,500
I cannot find my shoes. What the hell how should I know about your shoes?

241
00:42:54,600 --> 00:43:00,410
Suddenly there is a divorce case because she cannot find the shoes.

242
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:13,100
Is this love? Each one thought there is love but actually what it was,

243
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:25,090
it was an individual who demanded his own. An individual who did not want to give

244
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:35,100
but only to take. And you see the American model comes more and more of that type.

245
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:45,500
Therefore when these two people come together, they are not in phase 1

246
00:43:45,600 --> 00:44:02,690
in order to create a total human being but create a little monster, a little 'teras'.

247
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:14,980
In Greek 'teras' is monster, teratogenesis is born as a monster.

248
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:32,410
-What is the case with all those people who are living in arranged marriages

249
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:36,790
with no love before? Asia, Africa?

250
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:55,240
-This is a good question but in India, which I know, in which arranged marriage take place,

251
00:44:55,340 --> 00:45:03,830
what happens is that they go to the astrologer and the astrologer looks

252
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:10,930
at the charts of the people and decides if they are compatible.

253
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:22,870
It seems, I don't know by what kind of knowledge that are usually right.

254
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:28,490
When these people come together and they find out about the qualities of each other,

255
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:31,750
they really match.

256
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:41,660
Where in our societies in which we choose by our standards the partner,

257
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,260
we are usually incorrect.

258
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:55,320
Why? Because of the divorce numbers in the one society and the other society.

259
00:45:55,420 --> 00:46:00,320
You cannot live anymore, you say this makes me sick.

260
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:05,430
I cannot stay in that marriage because I will become sick.

261
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:16,500
So therefore the society, in which we live, has lost the capacity to recognize

262
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:20,590
the qualities of the other.

263
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:31,480
Unless two monsters are coming together, sometimes this may happen also.

264
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:36,400
Two monsters may come together and they match so much

265
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:42,660
that they maybe produce a good child.

266
00:46:54,080 --> 00:47:13,990
This is a cell under excitation and if the other cell is going like this, then it may happen.

267
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:21,820
But usually it comes like this in the western society.

268
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:34,160
It's not a matching, it's a conflict.

269
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:50,560
We see the importance of falling in love, which is a human quality of great order,

270
00:47:50,660 --> 00:48:06,670
which we have misused due to the incapacity to choose correctly.

271
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:21,880
There is another important factor which was since time immemorial,

272
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:27,570
which could bring people on the phase 1.

273
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:51,960
Except of 'eros' there is another factor, which could cancel this at least

274
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,310
the internal pollution.

275
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:04,880
What is this factor that was there since time immemorial.

276
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:10,970
We hear it from the depth of human existence.

277
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:22,990
-Belief.
-Belief, faith.

278
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:52,810
This state in which the individual lets his problems and says I give it to god.

279
00:49:54,310 --> 00:50:02,110
There is a state of security that comes in, in which people they believe they lean on

280
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:07,700
and therefore they have a lot of phases in nr 1.

281
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:13,700
They are living much more phases nr 1.

282
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:30,020
That is why all people who are under a religious state, they can perform,

283
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:34,110
they can create better children...

284
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:43,090
For instance, since you are talking about India.

285
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:53,760
India is a country in which everyone spiritually tries to create something,

286
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:58,780
to evolve spiritually.

287
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:15,530
The same is with people of rather undeveloped countries.

288
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:29,690
The need to believe into something higher gives them much more phase 1 states.

289
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:48,600
I have heard people confessing murder, having taken drugs, having stolen things

290
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:57,000
and they confess under a religious belief and you see a transformation.

291
00:51:57,100 --> 00:52:03,860
You see in their eyes a state of deep satisfaction.

292
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:11,760
That deep satisfaction gives them the possibility to be in phase 1 much more frequently

293
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:16,100
and therefore to have healthier children.

294
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:29,670
-Isn't this creating a lot of wars?

295
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:36,420
Islam are under a religious belief when they think that they are the only ones

296
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:40,940
and they are very aggressive. So I don't think this is so.

297
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:51,680
-We'll talk about that. When I say belief and faith, I mean real belief and real faith.

298
00:52:52,440 --> 00:53:01,500
Those who create wars are the people who want to control others through religion.

299
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:11,670
Those who want to control and to get authority through religion are creating wars,

300
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:20,020
not the people who believe, but those who exploit those people who believe.

301
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:27,300
You believe? Yes. Now we have to conquer and they push them to wars.

302
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:35,560
But anybody who is really in touch with god, who really is in touch

303
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:44,170
with real consciousness, to go to war? Forget it.

304
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:59,330
On the other hand these people being on phase 1, they see clearly what is happening outside.

305
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:05,640
You remember when we spoke about the Kosovo war

306
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:14,070
and the Nato people being monsters of that type.

307
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:19,670
They were just killing thousands of people without blinking an eye.

308
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:25,410
And those who were outside looking said my god.

309
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:36,060
In the name of religion or peace we have a massacre of people.

310
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:52,590
We are spreading radio-active materials in the whole of Europe, killing people.

311
00:54:54,340 --> 00:55:02,730
Why the radio-active materials are so dangerous for human beings?

312
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:10,980
Because they give a constant excitation of the cells.

313
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:23,480
They produce a constant excitation without any stoppage and therefore

314
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:35,070
we have mostly the teratogenesis, which we know, under radio-active influences.

315
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:45,660
-What I'd like to know is what role you, actually, see nurture takes in this?

316
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:50,910
If somebody produces a healthy child, can we actually corrupt this child and

317
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:57,500
make it unhealthy and can we take a child born in an excited state

318
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:01,120
and make that a healthy person?

319
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:09,910
-This is a good question but the child we are talking about in these phases are qualities

320
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:12,200
they are missing genetically.

321
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:22,920
What we see in these cases is for instance a case in which an enzyme is missing.

322
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:30,260
And the child will have this problem because of genetic predisposition.

323
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:42,570
So it is very difficult. If not totally impossible to bring back the qualities through

324
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:49,210
Homeopathy when genetically is missing the quality.

325
00:56:49,310 --> 00:57:07,210
It's missing for instance the ovaries. The woman ovaries are not functioning genetically.

326
00:57:07,310 --> 00:57:11,060
It's very difficult to correct that.

327
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:21,370
You get people who say I never felt love. This is not natural.

328
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:39,600
You talk to young women 25-30, they say never, not really.

329
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:52,080
What is missing? This passion which will be needed to bring them to the phase 1 state.

330
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:55,440
It's missing already from birth.

331
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:09,990
Is it understood that you have to project these ideas further in what actually happens

332
00:58:10,090 --> 00:58:13,170
in our societies.

333
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:25,920
And say what was your state when your child was born.

334
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:33,280
That becomes a very important factor.

335
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:42,860
When you have to advice somebody, you have to tell that these are the facts.

336
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:51,330
If you really want a complete human being, you have to be in that state.

337
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:59,950
Otherwise, either no conception or the conception will take place with a missing part.

338
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:05,830
-I hear what you are saying to some extend but considering

339
00:59:05,930 --> 00:59:14,000
that we are all supposing miasmatically sick, is really then no possibility

340
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:17,590
of getting a totally healthy child from anybody?

341
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:22,260
Because if we are miasmatically sick to some extent,

342
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:25,320
we must still possess some insecurity and conflict inside.

343
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:30,420
Therefore we never come to that total phase 1 to get an actually healthy child.

344
00:59:31,090 --> 00:59:41,070
-It is not everybody. I don't say 100% we are sick, therefore we cannot get a child.

345
00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:43,070
It's as simple as that.

346
00:59:43,170 --> 00:59:55,450
What I say is that giving the fact that we go into marriages or into relations,

347
00:59:55,550 --> 01:00:00,440
which they do not have these properties, these qualities,

348
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:10,350
then we are run into the danger of bringing out a child that will be missing certain qualities,

349
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:17,520
which are necessary for the regeneration of the human race, for continuing the human race.

350
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:27,270
And if we continue in this way, the race which we call today the western population

351
01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:31,270
will be totally degenerated.

352
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:34,650
Here we are talking about the health of the people and we have to understand

353
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:38,390
what we are doing to ourselves.

354
01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:46,310
Here is a place where we think of the future. We don't think, oh you have a headache,

355
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:50,050
take this remedy and kill the headache.

356
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:58,260
We have to see the totality of what is happening concerning health and we have to transfer

357
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:04,560
these ideas to the medical authorities and to medical institutions,

358
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:08,720
so they start changing a little bit their way of thinking.

359
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:19,810
Otherwise where do we land? Put a plastic heart, a plastic liver and two plastic kidneys

360
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:26,360
and we are happy.

361
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:34,580
The science. Is this science or is it monstrous minds?

362
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:48,550
The thing is that the monster here is not going to kill always but what is going to do,

363
01:01:48,650 --> 01:02:00,070
to look for blood? We get it. Money or fame or whatever.

364
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:10,720
And in the name of fame or money we have scientists who are producing ideas

365
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:14,310
which are dangerous.

366
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:18,470
This is what has happened in our society.

367
01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:31,860
Scientists we admire as accomplishments of science are coming from monstrous minds

368
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:36,720
that cannot think in a total way.

369
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:44,430
I found this, I will become rich, I will become famous...

370
01:02:44,530 --> 01:02:51,070
It doesn't matter what is the consequence of what you thought and what you discovered.

371
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:57,220
And we as society we accept all this, instead of resisting.

372
01:02:57,320 --> 01:03:05,600
What is resisting? Resisting is to get this third factor out.

373
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:12,830
If my time has come that I will die, I will die with integrity and with peace.

374
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:25,620
I don't have to live another two years with a plastic heart. This is inconceivable.

375
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:33,360
The problem is created here in the very beginning.

376
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:38,620
Because these children here they will develop...

377
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:43,850
If you miss a part, it's going to be replaced by another.

378
01:03:43,950 --> 01:03:47,480
If you miss one eye, the other eye is very acute.

379
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:50,930
If you miss one hand, with the other hand you become very dexterous.

380
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:55,620
if you miss both hands, with the feet you can paint, you can do anything.

381
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:59,870
It replaces, in the same way nature replaces.

382
01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:06,770
When you miss a part, the soul replaces it by another.

383
01:04:06,870 --> 01:04:12,540
That means you miss the possibility to love but you are very clever.

384
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:16,980
They make you very clever. Who made you very clever?

385
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:22,550
The scientists producing something without heart.

386
01:04:23,050 --> 01:04:31,540
Producing something that the heart is missing, that means the feeling is missing.

387
01:04:44,290 --> 01:04:46,770
-There are two factors to overcome this.

388
01:04:46,870 --> 01:04:54,530
One is eros and the other one is the state of faith.

389
01:04:54,630 --> 01:05:07,740
Can you think of faith as a state in which you feel content, secure,

390
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:16,850
then I would like to ask if there are any interactions between these two to measure?

391
01:05:16,950 --> 01:05:24,360
Between eros and faith. The reason for my question is the following.

392
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:36,520
Falling in love is something you cannot really control but faith and belief

393
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:45,370
that are part of Creation it is a point I can work out myself. That's why I ask.

394
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:53,630
-It's a very good question. The similarities are these.

395
01:05:54,620 --> 01:06:02,370
Falling in love it happens to you because of another person.

396
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:08,750
You fall in love because you find somebody to whom you trust completely

397
01:06:08,850 --> 01:06:10,870
and you give yourself.

398
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:19,350
Eros does not exist unless the other person reciprocates.

399
01:06:20,870 --> 01:06:25,660
Then love is created.

400
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:39,420
Otherwise it is not eros, it is a feeling which is missing the bigger part of satisfaction.

401
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:43,490
The reciprocal love of the other person.

402
01:06:45,730 --> 01:06:57,890
In the same way you can work on faith, you can pray, you can go to church,

403
01:06:57,990 --> 01:07:07,810
you do whatever are your duties, you meditate but you need the approval.

404
01:07:07,910 --> 01:07:19,970
What is called the blessing of god, which comes at a certain moment.

405
01:07:20,070 --> 01:07:27,720
There is a state of blessing that comes, which is as if the doors

406
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:34,400
have been opened and then you in communication, you are accepted.

407
01:07:38,330 --> 01:07:45,660
In the same way the phase 1 is when you are accepted.

408
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:54,140
Phase 1 does not come with I like this man or I like this woman.

409
01:07:54,240 --> 01:08:00,310
This does not bring you to phase 1. Because you always want.

410
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:06,060
The person is missing.

411
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:16,480
When the person comes and there is this unification, then there is total calmness inside.

412
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:18,660
And satisfaction.

413
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:29,080
That is where the creation of such a child will be the most healthy.

414
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:37,620
It will be a child that even if it has some defect,

415
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:45,230
even genetically, mentally and emotionally will be very much balanced.

416
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:52,290
-You are describing a very frightful situation when you are talking about those two phases.

417
01:08:52,390 --> 01:08:57,800
I mean the depression and the emotional situation.

418
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:18,560
If it can be inherited, it is like describing a new miasma.

419
01:09:21,070 --> 01:09:22,460
-What can be inherited?

420
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:48,540
-Those two phases. If these can be inherited, it is like describing a new miasma.

421
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:58,710
-No, I am describing what we know as the existing miasmas.

422
01:09:58,810 --> 01:10:09,880
The existing miasmas create more and more stages of that, they do not allow phase 1.

423
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:19,800
It's very little time, very little moments and that is why you need a very strong desire

424
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:25,300
for a person and then the satisfaction that you have finally, that person,

425
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:40,050
and then the conception and if it happens under this condition, then you have a good child.

426
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:46,970
But I will tell you something else also which is very interesting concerning faith.

427
01:10:50,140 --> 01:11:02,540
In our societies, the idea of gurus have become very popular. What is a guru?

428
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:14,290
A guru is a symbol which is replacing god, in which the person has the need to project

429
01:11:14,390 --> 01:11:19,270
that there is a perfect individual, very close to god,

430
01:11:19,370 --> 01:11:23,470
to whom I can trust and I can communicate.

431
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:43,200
The need for faith was filled with the different gurus and spiritual teachers which appeared

432
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:47,750
In our society, lately very much.

433
01:11:48,470 --> 01:12:01,640
Because the people who left from original faith, they went into a state of doubting and unbelieving.

434
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:10,110
They found themselves in a state of constant excitation and they tried quickly

435
01:12:10,210 --> 01:12:16,860
to replace that deep feeling with a symbol, a human being who is perfect

436
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:21,160
and to whom I can trust totally my life.

437
01:12:22,590 --> 01:12:30,780
Of course this is a very dangerous situation because these individuals

438
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:48,460
are exactly like all of us with certain weaknesses and when we found out that this is so,

439
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:50,950
then there is a big disappointment.

440
01:12:56,210 --> 01:13:01,370
And then if you believe to a guru and you are disappointed, then you cannot recover anymore.

441
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:13,580
You see the whole situation how it has been created slowly?

442
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:21,880
By going away from basic nature.

443
01:13:23,670 --> 01:13:30,040
We created an artificial world, which is going to collapse.

444
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:38,700
That is why Homeopathy is so important for the world because it has the possibility

445
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:47,810
to regenerate. To regenerate what has been degenerating all along.

446
01:13:52,070 --> 01:14:02,370
When you see the possibility of Homeopathy in severe pathology,

447
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:12,470
when you see the possibility, then you are amazed.

448
01:14:16,220 --> 01:14:25,200
What I want to repeat is to understand that this function of the human psyche,

449
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:37,220
the desire to be united, which we call eros, is a factor that should overcome this factor.

450
01:14:39,450 --> 01:14:50,010
If this desire or this love is not strong enough to overcome these conflicts

451
01:14:50,110 --> 01:15:03,620
and insecurities and fears, then we have not a completely calm state of selves.

452
01:15:04,370 --> 01:15:12,290
The same with the belief and faith, it's not a matter of I believe in god.

453
01:15:12,390 --> 01:15:21,780
It is a state of faith, a state of belief to bring up the relaxation of the cells.

454
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:28,660
If you ask anybody they say, I'm a Catholic, a Protestant, a Jewish,

455
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:33,350
a Mohammedan, a Christian.

456
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:36,290
It doesn't mean anything.

457
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:48,790
What we mean here is the real state of communication.

458
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:56,690
You commune, you feel that you talk to god and god talks to you.

459
01:15:56,790 --> 01:16:00,190
In the same way this is in a love affair.

460
01:16:04,030 --> 01:16:08,350
In a love affair you say something and the other person before you finish,

461
01:16:08,450 --> 01:16:10,340
he knows what you are talking about.

462
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:17,610
And then there is a reciprocal communication in another than verbal level.

463
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:30,760
In that state, the conception of children is much more healthy.

464
01:16:32,290 --> 01:16:35,910
The consequences of this theory should be that first of all

465
01:16:36,010 --> 01:16:49,170
that children are to be born best when the young people, in young age, they first fall in love.

466
01:16:50,670 --> 01:16:56,240
Because if this is overcome, and this is usually the case,

467
01:16:56,340 --> 01:17:00,340
because they say we are not ready to have a family.

468
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:07,740
Let's wait, let's take precautions and later on when we have established our job,

469
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:13,910
when we have better houses, then we have children.

470
01:17:14,010 --> 01:17:21,000
This idea is logical but from the point of view of health is wrong.

471
01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:28,740
The children that are healthy will be more healthy, if they are born

472
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:33,090
in the first real love affair.

473
01:17:39,090 --> 01:17:46,660
Because later on the mind interferes very much with the process

474
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:55,580
and does not allow this total relaxation, which happens in the beginning, unfortunately.

475
01:17:55,680 --> 01:18:06,750
Another conclusion we can draw is that children which are programmed...

476
01:18:08,010 --> 01:18:14,860
You program to have a child and then you have sex to have a child.

477
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:20,330
Later on what happens is that the woman becomes infertile and then there is anxiety

478
01:18:20,430 --> 01:18:26,990
and every time they try to find out what happens.

479
01:18:27,090 --> 01:18:32,410
This is not good condition for a child to be born.

480
01:18:32,510 --> 01:18:39,260
The child is born and then you have to battle a lot with problems with children.

481
01:18:40,230 --> 01:18:46,350
You see children that they have a lot of personality disorders.

482
01:18:46,450 --> 01:18:53,570
Then you battle and battle and then eventually after going through

483
01:18:53,670 --> 01:18:57,250
these personality disorders and you correct them,

484
01:18:57,350 --> 01:19:01,470
you see manifesting physical symptomatology.

485
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:06,930
And you have infections, you have physical diseases.

486
01:19:09,670 --> 01:19:22,840
What we state here is some facts, which can be accepted or cannot be accepted.

487
01:19:22,940 --> 01:19:30,820
It doesn't matter but you as counselors, as advisers, you have to know these things

488
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:34,180
in order to be able to advise correctly.

489
01:19:39,930 --> 01:19:50,990
After that it is on the choice and the freedom of each person to follow his fate.

490
01:19:51,090 --> 01:19:54,230
It's not your responsibility anymore.

491
01:19:54,330 --> 01:20:04,660
The love that goes away after 2-3 years and then they decide after 8 years

492
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:13,820
to have a child, this is not a good idea. It doesn't matter whether it is more practical.

493
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:21,250
I understand it is more practical but from the point of health it's not practical.

494
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:30,670
When I was in India, I lived in that culture quite a long time and so I can compare.

495
01:20:30,770 --> 01:20:40,570
The Indians are the biggest stealers, they steal but they never kill.

496
01:20:46,430 --> 01:20:48,310
They steal because they are very poor.

497
01:20:48,410 --> 01:20:53,170
So if you are rich, they say OK you are rich, then can steal from you.

498
01:20:54,370 --> 01:21:01,650
It is a survival instinct but the aggressiveness that we see in the West,

499
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:10,490
you don't see in India. You don't see the aggressiveness.

500
01:21:10,590 --> 01:21:19,560
You may see it eventually if the societies degenerate

501
01:21:19,660 --> 01:21:29,660
but by the time I was there in 1963, 64, 65 it was no aggressiveness.

502
01:21:31,670 --> 01:21:39,070
Now if the Indian people come in the West and they are injected with vaccinations

503
01:21:39,170 --> 01:21:48,070
and antibiotics and they enter into the western mentality,

504
01:21:48,170 --> 01:21:55,170
of course they will become also aggressive but I say it as a whole.

505
01:21:58,420 --> 01:22:08,150
There are a few couples only which are lucky enough to have this love continuing for years,

506
01:22:08,250 --> 01:22:14,660
for more than 3 years. They are very few cases we see that.

507
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:21,890
If anybody of you have this, try to keep it like a jewel.

508
01:22:21,990 --> 01:22:30,390
Don't misunderstand it and think that at a certain moment, maybe I can also divorce

509
01:22:30,490 --> 01:22:33,080
and have another affair.

510
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:44,830
So these are some of the conclusions that we have to come in case we want to advice somebody.
