1
00:00:16,825 --> 00:00:32,325
We have another objective to establish an understanding of what is health.

2
00:00:32,408 --> 00:00:42,742
And if we have accepted so far the idea
that an individual is functioning on 3 levels

3
00:00:42,825 --> 00:00:50,242
actually we have to have a
definition that fits all the 3 levels.

4
00:00:50,325 --> 00:01:10,117
What is the word that can characterize the definition on these 3 levels? The word is "Freedom" !

5
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:36,992
Health therefore, is freedom on the physical level, freedom from pain, discomfort. I'm not the slave of pain.

6
00:01:37,075 --> 00:01:49,700
Did you ever have a toothache? Did you ever have a severe pain to see how much slave you are in that pain?

7
00:01:49,783 --> 00:01:58,783
Can you think of anything else?
Forget it, you are a slave.

8
00:02:05,919 --> 00:02:14,825
Freedom from pain gives the definition of health in the physical.

9
00:02:14,908 --> 00:02:29,783
But there are people who say I don't have pain but I have general malaise, a general feeling of tiredness in my body.

10
00:02:29,867 --> 00:02:42,377
So therefore the freedom from pain has to be completed by a sense of well-being.

11
00:02:46,200 --> 00:03:00,169
So the definition on the physical level has to be like this. Freedom from pain has having as a state a feeling of well being.

12
00:03:00,252 --> 00:03:09,273
I feel well. It's a long time since we felt like this.

13
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:23,992
When I was thinking about these issues and I was trying to get an answer, I have seen quite a lot of patients in the meantime.

14
00:03:24,075 --> 00:03:37,033
I have seen healthy individuals. I remember a case of a villager who had come, not here, I was in Athens.

15
00:03:40,742 --> 00:03:58,325
He was relating to me a case where his neighbour came and put the boundaries of his land a little bit inside his.

16
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:20,523
He says 'I took my gun, I went there and I shoot him'. And of course when he came to be treated he was after prison.

17
00:04:22,658 --> 00:04:34,835
Very strong, but was he healthy? I thought this man is not healthy in his emotional side.

18
00:04:37,252 --> 00:04:53,658
And then I treated a lot, here in Greece in these times 1960's still the Communists were people of great fanaticism and passion.

19
00:04:53,742 --> 00:04:57,804
Down, the government and whatever !

20
00:05:00,356 --> 00:05:14,315
And I saw their psyche was always in a state of, you know if you mention the word "government"....

21
00:05:17,075 --> 00:05:23,919
And I said, is this a healthy state?

22
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:39,742
Then I saw other cases of people who were attached to another individual, usually a man to a woman.

23
00:05:39,825 --> 00:05:51,867
A man came and he was a slave to
that passion for that particular woman.

24
00:05:51,950 --> 00:06:04,117
His actions were irrational, totally
irrational, like the fanatics.

25
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:13,471
And you say, these are healthy people but in these levels something is wrong. What is wrong?

26
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:26,877
And then I saw spiritual people who were trying at least to attain it, they had a serenity and all that.

27
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:34,960
And how they faced all these
issues, with much more serenity.

28
00:06:36,335 --> 00:06:55,940
The definition of health was completed by the idea of freedom from passion on the emotional level.

29
00:06:59,575 --> 00:07:09,471
If you are very passionate you are the slave of your passion, whatever it might be.

30
00:07:13,908 --> 00:07:23,096
Then I saw individuals who had no passion at all.

31
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:48,356
They were people that had no passion
for anything. No interested, nothing.

32
00:07:53,033 --> 00:08:03,627
You lose your wife, it doesn't matter, you lose your home, it doesn't matter. He is a Mahatma, but he was not a Mahatma,

33
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:13,606
he was sick. He has apathy. That may give
you the idea of freedom from passion

34
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:18,367
but on the other hand you are apathetic.

35
00:08:22,023 --> 00:08:36,867
So the definition on this level should be that the person has to be free from passion but he has to have inside him

36
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:54,502
a dynamic serenity, dynamic calmness. The calmness which is alive, not a dead calmness, not I'm indifferent.

37
00:08:54,585 --> 00:09:07,606
I'm calm but I'm alive, perceptive. I think about everything, I perceive, I respond.

38
00:09:08,627 --> 00:09:16,231
Somebody is suffering I respond, somebody wants my help, I respond, somebody wants to talk, yes.

39
00:09:16,315 --> 00:09:23,044
I am alive but not passionate !

40
00:09:24,325 --> 00:09:31,377
Either you have Homeopathy,
everyone has Homeopathy or die!

41
00:09:35,377 --> 00:09:47,804
I take a bomb and I throw a bomb in the world because the world does not accept Homeopathy. I could be like this, why not.

42
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:52,658
Many of you think I am like this, it doesn't matter.

43
00:09:58,179 --> 00:10:02,325
I am much more tolerant unfortunately.

44
00:10:09,492 --> 00:10:19,408
So, I felt that the people who are really more in peace with themselves, they were more perceptive,

45
00:10:19,492 --> 00:10:39,721
more ready to come to the rescue, that means you have more love. Love flows naturally, you don't say to yourself

46
00:10:39,804 --> 00:10:47,856
'oh, I have to help'. If you say this, forget
it, the emotions are gone.

47
00:10:51,075 --> 00:11:06,877
You make a program, today I'll help this, this and then you try to accomplish these things, forget it, this is not healthy.

48
00:11:08,512 --> 00:11:25,867
But if you attain that state where there is no irritability, no passionate attachement to anything idea or whatever

49
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:37,367
then you may have a dynamic serenity inside
you and face calmly the situations.

50
00:11:38,158 --> 00:11:49,075
Who can do it? Nobody, but I say this is the target of a healthy state. It is where we should be looking at

51
00:11:49,158 --> 00:12:01,877
not that anybody is like that. Perhaps
some of you have some grandfather

52
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:18,710
whom you remember in the end years being like this but it's not an easy state to attain. So we are looking towards that.

53
00:12:19,044 --> 00:12:28,252
And then we come to the mental state. The health of the mental state that is even more difficult to attain.

54
00:12:28,335 --> 00:12:46,242
Because there we have to have freedom from - nobody has that - a healhty mental state

55
00:12:46,325 --> 00:13:03,992
is a state where you are free from selfishness. You are not selfish anymore.

56
00:13:05,408 --> 00:13:22,075
This is something for sure impossible for anyone to attain. All, we are selfish, I want this, I want that.

57
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:34,523
It is not possible to eliminate selfishness.
Because if you eliminate selfishness

58
00:13:34,606 --> 00:13:46,023
that means the sense that I'm separate, I am a separate human being - this is selfishness;

59
00:13:47,075 --> 00:14:00,502
I am and I want this, that and the other is 3-5 meters away, and the world is all around me.

60
00:14:02,117 --> 00:14:14,054
If we can eliminate that then the state in which we enter is a different state. We can make a jump in the consciousness

61
00:14:14,138 --> 00:14:32,804
and then we are actually connected with the cosmic consciousness, with God. Who can do that?

62
00:14:37,492 --> 00:14:51,117
You see it is pure mechanics. The moment I'm here and I'm separate, I cannot be flowing into the consciousness.

63
00:14:51,200 --> 00:15:04,742
I have the sense that I am here so everything will be limited, everything will be measured

64
00:15:04,825 --> 00:15:12,908
from me to that distance, to the other person, to the other things.

65
00:15:12,992 --> 00:15:25,408
If I can eliminate this idea, I'm nothing,
then I'm one with the consciousness.

66
00:15:25,533 --> 00:15:36,658
It is a very high spiritual state towards which we may be going, freedom from selfishness.

67
00:15:36,742 --> 00:16:02,075
It's the effort that everyone of us is doing every day to be able to be less selfish to be more in connection with that which we call God.

68
00:16:02,825 --> 00:16:19,283
We cannot eliminate that. I feel that nobody can really eliminate his selfishness, this egoistic element which is with us.

69
00:16:19,367 --> 00:16:32,252
It's not possible but we all try towards that goal. And I'll tell you something, the new generation

70
00:16:37,825 --> 00:16:55,033
is thinking a lot on these lines. That is why by taking the wrong path they went into drugs, they wanted to

71
00:16:55,117 --> 00:17:08,450
experience the sense of not being, so they took the drug and some of them they experience something so nice.

72
00:17:08,533 --> 00:17:20,138
And then they became slaves of that passion which is called spiritual passion or whatever.

73
00:17:21,533 --> 00:17:43,450
Because we can be slaves of our desire to become this, to become saints, one with the cosmic consciousness.
