1
00:00:19,667 --> 00:00:31,823
You told us that on the emotional level the freedom from passion will be the answer to health.

2
00:00:31,927 --> 00:00:42,729
Do you consider there is negative passion
and positive passion in all the form of arts?

3
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:50,625
 The greatest creative people of the world,
have all achieved things of passion.

4
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:59,292
You I believe, yourself, in a certain way
you are passionate about Homeopathy.

5
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:05,688
If you take the complete
 passion from somebody?

6
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:18,781
- It's a good question. You see I am good as Homeopath. He is good as a painter and he is good as a musician.

7
00:01:18,885 --> 00:01:34,365
These are qualities of the personality.
If I become passionate in a negative way as
 I mean,

8
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:45,094
that will make me behave in a
 totally fanatic way. That is disease.

9
00:01:45,198 --> 00:01:55,167
That means, my passion has gone too far. I have become fanatic and everything is Homeopathy,

10
00:01:55,802 --> 00:02:03,510
 I don't accept any other system of Medicine,
I don't accept anything else.

11
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:11,427
Then, you'll look upon me and say,
well he's good but he's fanatic.

12
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:27,052
That means, in my psyche, in my emotions I am a slave of that quality of mine which is to be a good Homeopath.

13
00:02:27,156 --> 00:02:39,698
It's ok but once I'm totally fanatic about it,
I am sick. Now what I mean passion?

14
00:02:39,802 --> 00:02:47,177
I mean something that enslaves you,
 it makes you a slave.

15
00:02:48,531 --> 00:02:58,771
You may come and say, you are also a slave because from morning to night you think, you do, all is Homeopathy.

16
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:12,167
If I do this, I am also sick. The artists, most
of the artists, have a form of sickness.

17
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:27,146
I believe great artists have this freedom.
They paint something beautiful and they
leave it.

18
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:44,448
 Some others they become absolutely engrossed with this passion and then there is an element of sickness in them.

19
00:03:44,552 --> 00:03:58,229
You will say, Dostoevsky, do you know him?
 The new generation doesn't know so much Dostoevsky,

20
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:11,823
Russian writer of previous years who wrote fantastic novels. He was an epileptic.

21
00:04:19,198 --> 00:04:26,469
Does this had anything to do
with what he created?

22
00:04:26,573 --> 00:04:33,583
Well maybe but he was free
of his disease in order to use it.

23
00:04:34,396 --> 00:04:47,333
That means, I can have a disease and this disease creates a situation around me

24
00:04:47,438 --> 00:04:55,563
 then I'm sensitive and I use that situation
in a creative manner. This is totally different.

25
00:04:55,667 --> 00:05:05,104
The fact remains that I'm sick
 in a level which is not the mental.

26
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:10,156
It is the physical and it has
 not affected the mental.

27
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:33,854
Mentally Dostoevsky was, according to me,
 quite healthy mentally with a mind synthetic, artistic

28
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:42,667
but synthetic mostly, because his work was
 quite a lot symbolic. He was writing novels

29
00:05:42,771 --> 00:05:57,948
and symbols like the bigger writers like Shakespeare, their minds are clean and clear.

30
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:09,771
The moment they become slaves
of that quality, then that becomes sickness.

31
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:22,125
Dostoevsky was sick in his physical
brain and he had epileptic fits.

32
00:06:23,531 --> 00:06:34,073
But without passion life is not interesting.
The moment you fall in love is the most easy

33
00:06:34,177 --> 00:06:49,000
things for us to get high, apart
from drugs. And then you feel uplifted.

34
00:06:50,333 --> 00:07:01,521
Well, a person who falls in love all the time there is something wrong with that, he goes into a passion state,

35
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:10,854
he becomes a slave of that connection.
For me there is a problem with him.

36
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:21,250
And you can see in Natrum muriaticums,
they fall in love very, very easily. Why?

37
00:07:21,354 --> 00:07:28,542
 Because they do not need real situations.
 They look somebody and say,

38
00:07:28,646 --> 00:07:38,063
oh nice he looked at me, everything happens in their mind. They are excited and then they go along

39
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:52,729
being in love for months. Then of course there is a time where they try to make it down to earth,

40
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:59,521
they get disappointed and then they
get in a Natrum muriaticum state.

41
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:09,823
That is a weakness of the organism,
on that level, which needs correction.

42
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:15,490
You give Natrum muriaticum
 and they stop falling in love.

43
00:08:17,552 --> 00:08:25,604
Well, not exactly like that, I exaggerate
a bit just to show you the situation.

44
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:39,052
You get a person, Tarentula, with all this sexual energy. A woman can go out in the street,

45
00:08:39,156 --> 00:08:55,417
try to find a man just like that. It's noon time, hormones are rising, and she tries to find a man. This is pathology.

46
00:08:56,167 --> 00:09:12,292
You give Tarentula, she will not go out anymore. Nux Vomica, these sexual remedies Platina, Medorrinhum.

47
00:09:15,646 --> 00:09:29,875
I remember one Platina, she says, 'what have you done?' She never told me, she was going with a lot of men

48
00:09:29,979 --> 00:09:41,396
but after Platina she said, I used to enjoy very much. What kind? And then they explain to me and I said,

49
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:49,479
'I'm sorry if you want back your
headaches, just drink some coffee

50
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:56,573
you get back your headaches and your enjoyments also'. You see, it's a pattern.

51
00:09:58,646 --> 00:10:09,052
She was a beautiful woman she had a man this week, another man next week, another man third week

52
00:10:09,156 --> 00:10:19,135
and there was a confusion when she came to me, headaches, confusion, depression etc.

53
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:36,510
It's ok I give her and say, oh I feel good but
 I don't need anymore. If you don't need,
you don't do it. That's it.

54
00:10:38,917 --> 00:10:46,177
-You agree that passion can be constructive?
 It can be negative or positive?

55
00:10:46,865 --> 00:10:57,250
- As long as it does not make you a slave.
Of course you love the woman you love.

56
00:10:57,354 --> 00:11:09,760
But if you attach yourself... there is a point in a relationship, two people they get together

57
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,062
 and they are very passionate
but they can also be free.

58
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:25,865
There is a time when one of the two gets attached, especially with marriage.

59
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:49,448
The day you get married, especially the
woman, feels 'now I got him'. You got him?

60
00:11:49,552 --> 00:12:02,354
 Now you are going to lose him. This is the time when the passion becomes negative and the

61
00:12:03,063 --> 00:12:16,438
other person usually doesn't like it and starts going away. The moment you start going away, the other person goes behind.

62
00:12:16,594 --> 00:12:28,583
These are rules which rule human behavior and then disease starts. This woman will be my patient,

63
00:12:28,688 --> 00:12:38,000
in 2,3,4 years it doesn't matter. She will come
 to the homeopath and say, 'fix me now'.

64
00:12:39,021 --> 00:12:54,906
The moment that you are free from this, you have great passion to love and you feel free.

65
00:13:00,177 --> 00:13:10,573
All the great love affairs that lasted were only those affairs that let free one another.

66
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:21,365
The moment that your passion overwhelms
you 'I want her, nobody will touch her',

67
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:30,906
then you are heading very fast for a problem.

68
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:54,083
The same with selfishness. The moment you feel, I am so powerful, the Prime Minister or whatever.

69
00:13:54,417 --> 00:14:05,865
The moment that you have to lose or you have
to be free of that, you cannot, then you fall.

70
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:21,646
And then egotism and greed, I want more, more, more, no stop. You become so passionate.

71
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:30,333
Onassis, just to use a name that everybody  knows, he made a lot of money.

72
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:49,781
What are you doing? You are heading for severe problems. Onassis had an appointment with me,

73
00:14:49,885 --> 00:14:59,396
one week before he fell ill,
when he came with his airplane here,

74
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:07,927
  on Wednesday he had an appointment with me.
As soon as he came, he had a flu and the flu

75
00:15:09,135 --> 00:15:20,760
was already affecting his lungs and he had a pneumonia. They hospitalized him in Athens, then they took him to Paris.

76
00:15:20,865 --> 00:15:31,708
He had 70 medical doctors, from all over the world, the best and in 70 days exactly he died.

77
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:40,802
Every day they took away one of his organs;
they had a meeting, now we don't need this organ, take it out.

78
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:51,646
 Cut half of the liver out, take out the lung, take out this, take out that and in 70 days he collapsed totally.

79
00:15:51,750 --> 00:16:03,771
He came to me, why? Because he had myasthenia, he started to be paralyzed.

80
00:16:05,844 --> 00:16:17,781
We made an appointment but we never came in contact. I never saw him. His karma was not  to see him, he went the other way

81
00:16:17,885 --> 00:16:27,938
and he went fast. For me if I treat this man, he could not understand what he was doing.

82
00:16:28,042 --> 00:16:33,760
He was stepping upon other people,
crashing them in order to make money.

83
00:16:33,865 --> 00:16:40,563
Forget it, you are heading for severe
problem. The more egotistical you are.

84
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:50,521
Can you imagine somebody who is very egotistical, I am the best homeopath and somebody says,

85
00:16:50,625 --> 00:17:11,073
'no you are not', you collapse. Egotism inside prepares us for disease which is quite serious.

86
00:17:11,177 --> 00:17:51,563
I will describe to you the number 1, upper left. The white spots are the predisposition with
 which this person is born.

87
00:17:51,667 --> 00:18:02,333
There are predispositions on a low level, on the physical and the emotional and the mental.

88
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:16,438
This is a person with very good health.

89
00:18:19,135 --> 00:18:27,000
That means he has a predisposition
 here, for developing a skin eruption.

90
00:18:27,104 --> 00:18:40,563
If this organism goes under stress he will develop a skin eruption first. If this is pushed forward, that means it's suppressed,

91
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:49,646
he will develop some deeper problems
 let's say in the mucus membranes.

92
00:18:50,552 --> 00:19:05,750
If this is still pushed inside, it may go up to mental level affecting a little bit his memory.

93
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:19,625
So there are other predispositions here which everyone has, that if this is kept on pushing, through wrong drugs,

94
00:19:19,729 --> 00:19:30,490
then the predisposition will go deeper and
higher but the original predisposition is very low.

95
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:43,510
The big points are the points in which
each one of us have mostly sensitivity.

96
00:19:44,594 --> 00:19:55,156
Somebody has sensitivity with their eyes.
Once they are affected, the first thing that
is affected is the eyes.

97
00:19:55,573 --> 00:20:09,073
You have a high blood pressure and glaucoma. Hereditary predisposition for glaucoma. And you say at the age of 20,21

98
00:20:09,177 --> 00:20:20,708
they are stressed and they develop glaucoma. Others have predisposition to develop heart problem or skin or kidney.

99
00:20:20,979 --> 00:20:29,333
So not everyone under the same
 stress will develop the same problems.

100
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:34,938
And there are organisms who
have much more resistance.

101
00:20:35,042 --> 00:20:45,687
They are the lucky people who have
 good organisms that resist and show

102
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:51,333
the predisposition on a very low level.

103
00:20:52,375 --> 00:21:02,000
Then you go higher and deeper. And then you say deeper and deeper and then here you are

104
00:21:02,104 --> 00:21:08,646
very close to destroying the
very deep part of the individual.

105
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:23,938
That is why you see sometimes just a love affair, the first love affair and a woman goes into a state of depression

106
00:21:24,042 --> 00:21:31,667
and very soon goes into manic
depression or schizophrenia.

107
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:42,271
Why she goes into schizophrenia while another one she just cries out and overcomes the whole problem.

108
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:50,885
The natural reaction of the organism, we have defences which tell us what the organism can do.

109
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:57,250
And the most healthy people,
have healthy reactions.

110
00:21:58,042 --> 00:22:09,896
That means if they must get angry, they get angry and they show it. If they must cry, they cry and they don't care.

111
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:22,490
This is a healthy reaction preventing a lot of problems that may come afterwards
if you keep inside.

112
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:38,604
That's why here we have a Nat-m,
a Nat-m here and here. All these can be the same remedy

113
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:51,938
with different predisposition. So this Nat-m
 here, under stress she will cry out.

114
00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:06,115
This here, she cannot cry anymore.
Crying is impossible for them. Why?

115
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:12,854
Because the predisposition for them
is quite deep into the emotional level.

116
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:21,271
They have a weakness in the emotional level,
 the organ which is elected for reacting

117
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:30,938
towards a specific stress is not functioning properly and she will say, I cannot cry.

118
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:41,917
They lose their mother whom they love very much, they lose their children they cannot cry.

119
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:54,938
This is a bad situation which will lead eventually, because all the grief stays inside, it cannot come out.

120
00:23:55,042 --> 00:24:10,135
The grief must come out naturally. You have a grief you cry, you shout. Don't be afraid of that reaction.

121
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:20,865
If you have grief and you see that the
person cannot express grief, you have a big problem to face.

122
00:24:23,198 --> 00:24:33,646
Of course there are stages in between.
They can cry a little bit, they can cry a little bit more, very much or they cannot cry at all.

123
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:41,135
When they cannot cry at all then you
have here a situation which is quite serious.

124
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:54,333
Treating this patient here, you will move
 down the predisposition towards these levels.

125
00:24:55,885 --> 00:25:02,333
Always going towards the periphery.

126
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:11,375
Another thing which you have to observe
 here, we say this periphery is the skin.

127
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:21,271
Now, see something which is very
 important for you to understand.

128
00:25:21,375 --> 00:25:31,469
An ailment of the skin on this level,
 is a very severe skin eruption.

129
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:40,583
We have skin eruptions which
 are of very severe order.

130
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:53,542
That means, the organism keeps it on the
skin but still the condition is very serious.

131
00:25:53,885 --> 00:26:09,333
The moment that this kind of eruption goes inside, the whole person - you see this person here, here is the predisposition

132
00:26:09,438 --> 00:26:28,667
it will go right deep in here. If this is pushed inside it will go right deep and destroy the person;

133
00:26:28,771 --> 00:26:38,333
then you will have schizophrenia, manic depression and psychotic states which are very severe.

134
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:55,750
So a skin eruption is not so simple. We have eruptions which are simple eruptions, we have eruptions which are quite severe.

135
00:26:56,042 --> 00:27:12,698
For instance psoriasis which can cover almost the whole body is a condition which is quite severe and I will put it on this level.

136
00:27:12,802 --> 00:27:22,938
The moment that you push inside psoriasis, then you may have neuro muscular disorders, you may have psychological

137
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:37,688
disorders and the best you can have is psoriatic arthritis, that means a severe arthritic condition which destroys the joints.

138
00:27:38,104 --> 00:27:52,740
The joints are deformed. This is the best; the next is asthma, the affection on nervous system,

139
00:27:52,844 --> 00:28:01,552
peripheral nervous system, central nervous system where you have the psychotic conditions.

140
00:28:03,104 --> 00:28:20,896
I have seen some cases treated with methotrexate. It is a very severe drug given for cancer.

141
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:38,865
And they have discovered that if they give it to psoriatic patient, psoriasis disappears. With what punishment?

142
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:44,667
The punishment is that these
people are driven almost crazy.

143
00:28:44,771 --> 00:28:56,250
Their character changes, psychotic
 problems, anxieties, fears.

144
00:28:59,417 --> 00:29:10,313
In this model you will see something else.
You treat here the patient, let us say on mental level quite deep.

145
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:25,229
And if this goes there, that means outside, on that level on the physical body are the lungs.

146
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:34,563
So you treat here the mental or the emotional problems and then it goes to the lungs

147
00:29:34,667 --> 00:29:41,417
and you have the development of a serious
 lung condition which is like asthma.

148
00:29:49,177 --> 00:30:00,896
So therefore sometimes you treat a case
and he says 'I feel better' and in 3 months later

149
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:10,573
the whole force of the disease goes to the physical body and then appears the asthma.

150
00:30:12,667 --> 00:30:20,156
-On which level would you put somebody who cannot sleep at all? The sleeplessness.

151
00:30:42,042 --> 00:30:54,271
-Sleeplessness most of the times is a disease connected with the emotional-mental level.

152
00:30:54,375 --> 00:31:07,760
And actually not with this level but a level which is deeper which is the subconscious loading, the anxieties, the fears

153
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:17,740
which are not appearing as anxieties or fears. They appear in the subconscious during sleep

154
00:31:17,844 --> 00:31:33,240
where after a little bit of sleep, they overtake
 and then make the patient wake up and cannot sleep anymore.

155
00:31:34,802 --> 00:31:49,958
If such a disease is treated allopathically the person may develop fears and anxieties which are quite severe.

156
00:31:59,646 --> 00:32:09,604
They have not found a way to suppress this ailment totally. That means some people who have the problem

157
00:32:09,708 --> 00:32:19,448
they have to take a drug to sleep, they are not cured and next day they have to take again in order to sleep.

158
00:32:19,552 --> 00:32:32,823
If they find a drug that cures them,
that means after this drug, they now can sleep.

159
00:32:32,927 --> 00:32:45,438
They will invariably develop psychotic
 problems, usually phobias and anxieties.

160
00:32:52,198 --> 00:32:57,396
-They stop dreaming.

161
00:32:58,708 --> 00:33:10,667
-I don't know maybe the dreaming, we all dream, whether we remember or not is a different story.

162
00:33:10,771 --> 00:33:17,188
But there are people really who suffer psychologically who don't remember their dreams.

163
00:33:17,292 --> 00:33:25,854
You ask them do you remember any dream ever? No. They say 'I cannot remember any of my dreams'

164
00:33:25,958 --> 00:33:39,865
 and this for me points out to a block
 in this level which does not allow communication.

165
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:52,188
Because dreams are of different kinds, not all dreams are the same. There are nightmares

166
00:33:52,292 --> 00:34:02,583
and other dreams because of environment, you feel very cold or hot etc. you ate too much,

167
00:34:02,688 --> 00:34:13,937
the wrong food and there are some
dreams which are informative.

168
00:34:14,042 --> 00:34:24,312
They give you information. If you dream such
a dream you feel quite well in the morning.

169
00:34:24,417 --> 00:34:33,417
And sometimes the information is very
 exact for what is going to happen.

170
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:46,646
How many of you had such dreams,
once in your life. You see?

171
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:51,156
It's a phenomenon which is very common.

172
00:34:51,260 --> 00:35:10,958
What about neurodermatitis?
Neurodermatitis is a quite serious condition
 and goes up in the scale.

173
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:49,979
There are certain skin conditions which I don't remember now the names, which are very severe.

174
00:35:50,958 --> 00:35:59,083
There are conditions like Hydradenitis.
 Do you know Hydradenitis?

175
00:36:01,865 --> 00:36:15,823
Which appears in the deeper tissues of the skin, it creates severe inflammations and then

176
00:36:15,927 --> 00:36:25,188
 you have big swellings and affects
the whole body, affects the face, the nose,

177
00:36:25,292 --> 00:36:49,313
disfigures in the face, leaves keloids and it
 is very painful condition with pus, discharging
 for months or years.

178
00:36:49,417 --> 00:37:03,313
They are not healing and this is a condition which is going quite high. There are other conditions which I have seen,

179
00:37:03,417 --> 00:37:17,469
 skin eruptions terrible, that you smell and you can't stand in the same room, it's terrible.

180
00:37:18,292 --> 00:37:27,062
They have specific names which I can't remember now and they are very difficult to cure.

181
00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:32,083
You have to be careful not to suppress them.

182
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:38,927
-Such skin conditions would arise
from a deep mental state?

183
00:37:39,042 --> 00:37:58,938
-No, not at all. Leprosy which is not skin but it appears as skin on the periphery, is another severe disease.

184
00:37:59,042 --> 00:38:09,000
You suppress leprosy and it goes there.

185
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:21,292
-Would a person being treated for such a skin condition and in the process the skin tends to
 get better,

186
00:38:21,396 --> 00:38:28,146
would it drive the mental up?
I'm asking out of personal experience.

187
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:47,625
 I had cystic acne for the last 15 years.
This state brought out a mental state of not wanting to go out,

188
00:38:47,729 --> 00:38:59,490
not confident and it brought up a mental state. I've been treated by Homeopathy for 15 years

189
00:38:59,594 --> 00:39:11,333
no results and then I decided I can live with it because people still want me,as a physician, no matter how I look like.

190
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:34,719
-If you treat it locally, if you take antibiotics
 and you put creams, you will develop most probably,

191
00:39:34,823 --> 00:39:43,771
either cystitis or problems  with your kidneys
or problems with your lungs or liver.

192
00:39:44,802 --> 00:39:52,542
Or if the organism is not strong
 enough in this level, it may even go

193
00:39:52,646 --> 00:40:03,229
deeper where it can cause depression, dissatisfaction. On the mental level,

194
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:16,823
you are never satisfied. What you are
saying it's true that the appearance

195
00:40:16,927 --> 00:40:25,073
 of such skin eruption causes social
 problems which the social problems

196
00:40:25,177 --> 00:40:39,177
affect all the organism and can cause mental symptomatology. But this is secondary.

197
00:40:40,708 --> 00:40:44,104
It can go away very easily.

198
00:40:53,958 --> 00:41:05,833
We say it's not always good to see such an eruption unless the eruption is of a low order.

199
00:41:14,573 --> 00:41:31,000
The next question is, who is more sick?
A person with a heart problem,

200
00:41:31,104 --> 00:41:41,438
a person with a liver problem, a person
with a lung problem, skin problem?

201
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:48,833
And previously to that understanding
 your answer could be,

202
00:41:50,792 --> 00:41:59,396
oh yes, the person with skin
problems is better. Not always.

203
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:09,271
 If the skin problem is very high, we have a heart problem which can be of that order, right here.

204
00:42:09,375 --> 00:42:15,823
And the skin problem will be there.
So treating the skin problem of that order you

205
00:42:15,927 --> 00:42:29,198
may have actually the disease going
here and affecting the stomach.

206
00:42:36,688 --> 00:42:49,490
And then treating this and you have another skin eruption of a low order, treating this, you go there
and you have some

207
00:42:49,594 --> 00:42:59,313
effect on the memory; and you treat that and you have finally an eruption which comes out and it's of low order.

208
00:42:59,417 --> 00:43:10,448
-To say that a skin problem is high or low according to the severity of skin disease or according to what?

209
00:43:10,552 --> 00:43:31,135
-According to the prognosis that we have
and the severity of the skin eruption.
Is anybody dermatologist here?

210
00:43:39,469 --> 00:43:55,438
Let us say, we have a disease on the
skin which is called Epidermolysis Bullosa.

211
00:43:56,708 --> 00:44:09,740
How many people know this disease?
It's a disease which seem to affect the skin,

212
00:44:09,844 --> 00:44:23,375
that means the person is born with no possibility to build the skin, he remains without skin.

213
00:44:25,646 --> 00:44:32,792
 The absorption, the elements which he needs, he cannot take and therefore the skin is not built.

214
00:44:33,875 --> 00:44:42,458
You have children without skin.
If they touch anything there is a wound.

215
00:44:43,292 --> 00:45:02,490
These children live up to the age of 7-8 at the most. This is a very severe skin condition
 which leads to death.

216
00:45:04,042 --> 00:45:21,125
Where an eczema is very low in order.
A usual acne condition is very low.

217
00:45:21,917 --> 00:45:31,938
So if you are treating a woman for premenstrual problems and you cure her, you may see

218
00:45:32,042 --> 00:45:49,802
she is developing some acne. This is quite good. But now if I ask you who is more sick,

219
00:45:49,906 --> 00:46:00,177
a person with a heart condition or
a person with psoriatic arthritis?

220
00:46:08,438 --> 00:46:19,406
Psoriatic arthritis is on the joints. Heart problems are on the heart; it is an organ which is more deep

221
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:29,135
more affected and therefore the answer that comes immediately is the psoriatic arthritis.

222
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:43,604
-I think it depends on how severe is the heart condition or is it just arrhythmia or something

223
00:46:43,708 --> 00:46:51,802
 that threatens life. It depends on the severity.

224
00:46:53,583 --> 00:47:09,333
-But if you treat a heart condition and then arthritis develops what happens then?
Is it good or bad?

225
00:47:10,104 --> 00:47:12,896
-Good.

226
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:21,469
-Good because it goes to the outside, yes.
 But on the other hand you say that

227
00:47:21,573 --> 00:47:28,781
the heart condition might be milder than the arthritic condition because it is psoriatic arthritis.

228
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:40,083
  Reumatoid arthritis for instance is a disease which is much more serious than simple arthritis.

229
00:47:41,646 --> 00:47:53,073
It is a systemic disease which affects the
 whole organism and creates problems

230
00:47:53,177 --> 00:48:05,594
with the joints and the person is really deformed.
You can have arthritis, rheumatism with no problem.

231
00:48:06,979 --> 00:48:24,406
So what is the measure? The question comes many times, who is more sick the one

232
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:27,521
who is depressed or the one
 with heart problems?

233
00:48:27,625 --> 00:48:33,740
The one who has bad liver condition
or the one who has anxieties?

234
00:48:33,844 --> 00:48:39,083
The one who has very severe skin eruption or...

235
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:51,333
It is very difficult to measure
health, to say who is healthy.

236
00:48:53,667 --> 00:48:57,573
I'll give you another example.

237
00:48:59,625 --> 00:49:15,240
We know that people with very
good minds died from cancer.

238
00:49:24,333 --> 00:49:34,542
 People who are saintly.  In India they have Ramakrishna, died from cancer.

239
00:49:38,333 --> 00:49:40,333
-Krishnamurti?

240
00:49:40,438 --> 00:49:58,854
-No Krishnamurti was my patient, he did not die. Ramana Maharishi, another saint from India
 died from cancer.

241
00:49:58,958 --> 00:50:09,396
You will find a lot, where the mind is so clear
and the soul is clean they still die from cancer.

242
00:50:10,646 --> 00:50:23,208
So we have  to find a way to measure health.
To say, this person is healthier than this one.

243
00:50:23,313 --> 00:50:38,813
In our effort to cure somebody we have to measure this, we have to know where we take this person,

244
00:50:38,917 --> 00:50:49,083
 from this point to that point. From this point which is low to a better point, which is high.

245
00:50:53,000 --> 00:51:12,604
We have a case a man who works in a bank and he comes to us and says, 'I have this and this problem'.

246
00:51:12,708 --> 00:51:23,375
Then we give a remedy and he says, 'I cannot concentrate anymore I have to leave the bank'.

247
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:41,531
Yet the ailments for which he came, pains etc. are better. He left the bank, this is no good.

248
00:51:43,354 --> 00:51:55,490
He says, 'oh well I' m too bored',
he gives different excuses for not working.

249
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:06,938
 Not good. That means we have done something to his organism which has promoted disease, not health.

250
00:52:08,833 --> 00:52:17,625
-Some persons work in a work which is not good for them because they lack the energy which is needed for them

251
00:52:17,729 --> 00:52:26,917
to find their own path in life. In such a case,
 if they leave their work and begin to work

252
00:52:27,021 --> 00:52:35,917
with something which is better for them.
This is not something bad I think.

253
00:52:37,333 --> 00:52:50,052
-Yes, I don't talk about such a case.
 I talk about a case where he says, 'I have headaches

254
00:52:50,156 --> 00:52:59,854
and lack of concentration', you give a
 remedy, the headaches are better but he says

255
00:52:59,958 --> 00:53:06,771
 'I cannot concentrate anymore in my
 work and I have to leave my work'.

256
00:53:08,021 --> 00:53:17,802
This is not a good development in the case.
It is different if by choice a person says

257
00:53:17,906 --> 00:53:31,625
 'now I'm going to leave this and do something else'. But his choice is limited by the fact that he cannot concentrate

258
00:53:31,729 --> 00:53:42,552
and he cannot add numbers. So in this condition we say we did something wrong with the case.

259
00:53:44,135 --> 00:53:47,979
What is the measure?
What measures health?

260
00:53:49,021 --> 00:53:59,490
-We have to think how much the karma in which we live has to do with what is ill and what's not.

261
00:53:59,594 --> 00:54:06,604
 To think about our task in life and whether we have finished it. According to yoga we have 3 kinds of karma,

262
00:54:06,708 --> 00:54:17,917
one of them is the one which we have to work on  this life but on the other hand we also have to build up in this life.

263
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:31,135
So if yogis and people with very good minds still develop cancer or other severe illness

264
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:40,490
that means that they are taken from us because that is their karma. They have to stop living

265
00:54:40,594 --> 00:54:50,958
and there is nothing we can do about it.
This is something that goes beyond our work.

266
00:54:52,708 --> 00:55:02,135
-My answer is that looking upon the problem in this way, is looking from the angle of spirituality.

267
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:28,083
I'm trying to look from the angle of Health.
How we, practically, can know what is going on in a case we treat?

268
00:55:29,135 --> 00:55:34,740
How will we evaluate whether this
 person is doing better or worse?

269
00:55:40,583 --> 00:55:52,469
I have seen the most confusing issues when somebody gives a remedy, especially if the person who gives

270
00:55:52,573 --> 00:56:01,354
the remedy is your opponent. You work in a
 town where there are 3 Homeopaths.

271
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:06,604
One gives a remedy and then the patient
 leaves him and goes to the other one.

272
00:56:06,708 --> 00:56:17,760
He will say, 'well he gave you the wrong remedy'. What I want is that you have the understanding

273
00:56:17,865 --> 00:56:23,813
to know whether really the person is
doing better or doing worse.

274
00:56:23,917 --> 00:56:35,052
The person may be doing better but because now he has more pains, he leaves the one
 doctor and goes to the other.

275
00:56:35,156 --> 00:56:44,563
And he says 'I have more pains'. The question that you have to ask is 'how are you in these different levels?'

276
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:52,313
If you are better in these different levels then
I have to say, he gave you the right remedy but

277
00:56:52,417 --> 00:56:57,792
 I have to have the knowledge to tell you that.

278
00:56:59,042 --> 00:57:07,708
And later on when I will show video cases, you will see what happens with the evaluation of a practitioner.

279
00:57:08,688 --> 00:57:14,594
Oh you are doing so badly !
And the person is doing excellent.

280
00:57:16,438 --> 00:57:23,594
Why? Because they do not have this
knowledge we are talking about.

281
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,469
This knowledge is absolutely necessary.

282
00:57:35,469 --> 00:57:46,250
-I think we can measure health by looking
 at how many inner prisons a person has.

283
00:57:46,354 --> 00:57:56,813
How able is to say, ok I'm doing this or that.
How much he can make his own decisions

284
00:57:56,917 --> 00:58:07,802
 without having forces that tell him, he has
to do this or he can't do this because of this

285
00:58:07,906 --> 00:58:17,531
and this reason, on the emotional or physical level. I think health is the absence of this kind of prisons.

286
00:58:23,417 --> 00:58:38,740
-How much freedom you have, but how
 do you measure? I'm trying to find a rule

287
00:58:38,844 --> 00:58:52,906
that will measure the health of everyone
 of us. What is Health, equilibrium.

288
00:58:56,292 --> 00:59:08,896
-I think you have to look at the person as an individual and see if he is functioning better than when you saw him the first time.

289
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:18,552
So if this person when you first saw him was at least working and now he's lost his job this is not a good sign.

290
00:59:18,656 --> 00:59:27,042
But had he changed his job and gone for something which makes him feel better, then that would be a good sign.

291
00:59:28,042 --> 00:59:41,229
-You are answering on a specific example.
I'm trying to find a rule, a measure of Health,

292
00:59:41,333 --> 00:59:52,813
a rule by which I will be measuring Health everytime. Because the problem we have to face here

293
00:59:52,917 --> 01:00:00,104
 is not whether the body is healthy but the whole human being is healthy. This is the problem.

294
01:00:00,208 --> 01:00:11,135
 The problem is that we have a human being
 that has mind, spirit, body, psyche, emotions.

295
01:00:12,396 --> 01:00:23,073
You see the idea which prevails in the Medical schools is that if the body is healthy, you go

296
01:00:23,177 --> 01:00:41,729
you have a check-up and everything is OK, go.
 He goes out, he takes a machine gun and kills a few people.

297
01:00:41,833 --> 01:00:53,417
 But his check-up was good. Yes, but you did not have the  means to make a general check-up.

298
01:00:54,750 --> 01:01:04,604
-I think measurement could be if somebody is creative. You could measure by looking at his creativity.

299
01:01:04,708 --> 01:01:13,563
Because somebody who has pain and in spite of that can continue his work and somebody

300
01:01:13,667 --> 01:01:25,802
who has a few pains but does not have any joy of living. So I think creativity would be a way to measure.

301
01:01:27,375 --> 01:01:45,688
-That's correct. Creativity, how much creativity
 is in an individual. But if we leave it up to
here, will not be good.

302
01:01:46,729 --> 01:01:51,260
I will tell you some people who are very creative.

303
01:01:52,313 --> 01:02:03,177
There is somebody who has very creative ideas, for instance one of them is how to rob a bank.

304
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:16,896
 He collects his friends and says we do this and that and we all become very rich very soon.

305
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:24,698
And then he has another creative idea of
how to rob the yacht of the person in the sea

306
01:02:24,802 --> 01:02:34,958
and then another creative idea etc. I take this away which is not very good example

307
01:02:35,063 --> 01:02:50,052
but I will take another example of the person who has a factory. I have a factory and I create a product

308
01:02:50,156 --> 01:03:02,354
 which is actually nothing but we go to channel 7, which sells such products and we present

309
01:03:02,458 --> 01:03:14,271
this product; it's a ring right here you wear it
 and you are almost cured by everything.

310
01:03:17,417 --> 01:03:25,542
 Next day everybody buys the ring, give me the ring and next day the man is very rich of course.

311
01:03:25,646 --> 01:03:38,802
He had this creative idea. So somewhere we
 have to find the balance of what is happening.

312
01:03:38,906 --> 01:03:49,927
You know the robbers are very healthy
people; they can run so fast.

313
01:03:54,646 --> 01:04:05,604
They can give excuses so fast that even the trained police go into a kind of limbo;

314
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:08,625
they don't know whether he
 is telling the truth or not.

315
01:04:08,729 --> 01:04:17,292
I mean fast minds, fast runners, what's
 this, the mind is very clear, very fast.

316
01:04:19,979 --> 01:04:34,083
So we have to have another parameter  to measure real health. What is the other parameter?

317
01:04:39,552 --> 01:04:54,313
-When somebody is happy with what he does and is not thinking that he wants to do more and more which he can't do it anymore.

318
01:04:54,417 --> 01:05:00,594
When you are happy with what you
do and what you have.

319
01:05:01,927 --> 01:05:09,750
-They are happy if they get over
20million  they are happy.

320
01:05:21,490 --> 01:05:32,729
I repeat the question. She says, you ask the patient if he says 'I feel better, I have more
 vitality,

321
01:05:32,833 --> 01:05:36,646
I sleep better', I know he's doing better.
But she's answering the question how do you

322
01:05:39,906 --> 01:05:44,885
evaluate the effect of a treatment.
I do not ask this question at this moment.

323
01:05:46,083 --> 01:05:52,146
But I'm asking another question.
I say how do you measure health in general?

324
01:05:52,250 --> 01:06:00,917
How can you say this person is
more healthy than another one?

325
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:28,802
-I think how useful the creativity is for the
 bigger society or how much he exeeds
the egoistic self.

326
01:06:29,688 --> 01:06:54,406
-That's correct. I will give you another example
 of somebody in Athens who is known for
 working only for others.

327
01:06:54,510 --> 01:07:06,063
He really works all the time for others. He helps anybody who is in need here and there.

328
01:07:06,167 --> 01:07:14,510
 He lives by himself very poorly but still
he tries to help everybody else.

329
01:07:18,156 --> 01:07:20,813
 Is this the super healthy person?

330
01:07:20,917 --> 01:07:23,531
-No.

331
01:07:24,594 --> 01:07:37,938
-So you have to strike a balance.
You use the creativity for yourself as much as

332
01:07:38,042 --> 01:07:52,740
you use the creativity for the others. If you can have that balance where the creativity serves your needs,

333
01:07:52,844 --> 01:08:05,958
 at the same time serves the needs of the society, then most probably you are in the best
possible health.

334
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:23,240
Now, it depends on the kind of creativity ok. A carpenter is a person who creates a nice table.

335
01:08:24,542 --> 01:08:40,167
If that serves others it is a good creativity.
 That's why usually a good carpenter is
quite a healthy individual.

336
01:08:42,531 --> 01:09:00,854
But the creativity of the man who produces this product and selling it 20 times over its price,

337
01:09:00,958 --> 01:09:22,427
 that man with all his greediness though he is creative, this is not healthy. A lot of people have such talents.

338
01:09:22,531 --> 01:09:26,698
They have the
 talent of making a lot of money.

339
01:09:30,510 --> 01:09:43,594
That means they are selling a product that
 costs little for much more. That is not
serving the society.

340
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:58,198
It's tricking the society. It's telling lies to the society in order to exploit the society, he is not healthy.

341
01:10:06,865 --> 01:10:25,438
If I have some needs which I don't take care
of and always I give to others, that means
I am not healthy either.

342
01:10:26,490 --> 01:10:32,823
So both extremes are going for disease.

343
01:10:38,823 --> 01:10:47,646
-I think if you got the freedom to do what makes you most happy, you will be in the best position

344
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:55,417
to do a good thing for yourself and the rest
of the world and that counts for everyone.

345
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:11,104
-Exactly, this is what we have been saying.
 If you are in peace with yourself,
you will be able to do the best.

346
01:11:11,823 --> 01:11:28,437
But what I say is that there are a lot of people who are happy in making money for instance.

347
01:11:28,542 --> 01:11:42,438
This is a happiness which depends on how much they earn. This happiness is not what we are aiming at.

348
01:11:43,208 --> 01:11:50,531
Because the moment you are going to lose the money, you are going to be unhappy.

349
01:11:56,354 --> 01:12:09,583
We've been talking about the cooperation of the 3 levels that you cannot stop your emotions

350
01:12:09,688 --> 01:12:16,365
and do what pays you or you
think is your interest.

351
01:12:16,469 --> 01:12:27,417
You have to go according to your emotions
and to that which is feeling best inside you.

352
01:12:27,521 --> 01:12:35,854
There is no question about it. But if you look from outside and you make an evaluation,of your health,

353
01:12:35,958 --> 01:12:49,417
 after all this, you get a mark. And you say 100, 98, 97, 96 and it goes down.

354
01:12:50,771 --> 01:13:09,865
So when a person is sick and comes to us we have to know to what degree he is sick, to measure his health.

355
01:13:11,083 --> 01:13:24,198
And by talking and understanding, then
we are in a position to evaluate that he
is in degrees 87 or whatever.

356
01:13:28,333 --> 01:13:36,729
-We can measure it by looking at the
product of creativity.

357
01:13:37,542 --> 01:13:55,781
-Well, this is looking partially. What I'm saying
 is that whatever is your creativity,

358
01:13:55,885 --> 01:14:06,615
it depends on specific points which
 characterize your personality.

359
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:19,698
It has to have the element of serving
 your needs and serving society as well.

360
01:14:19,802 --> 01:14:26,625
Unless it has this element, then
somewhere there is an imbalance.

361
01:14:26,729 --> 01:14:42,552
A depression therefore how deep it is? When she says I cannot do anything due to the depression.

362
01:14:42,750 --> 01:14:55,896
That means that her creativity has totally destroyed her, that depression is worse than
a heart problem.

363
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:02,792
She has a heart problem but still can
 function, can create, can go ahead.

364
01:15:04,708 --> 01:15:13,021
So therefore when you treat the depression
 and goes into the heart problem,

365
01:15:13,125 --> 01:15:24,594
once the creativity rises, then
 it's a better state of health.

366
01:15:26,417 --> 01:15:32,073
-This is a very relative way of judging
and the judge has to be involved enough

367
01:15:32,177 --> 01:15:36,052
to understand the level of
evolution of your patient.

368
01:15:36,156 --> 01:15:45,583
And then when you judge, each time will be all the 3 planes on how much better the person is?

369
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:57,135
-I say these things to you who are going to treat patients and you have to know what you are doing

370
01:15:57,240 --> 01:16:10,854
and not spoil a good reaction of a remedy.
 For the person himself is very difficult to measure the state of health in which he is.

371
01:16:10,958 --> 01:16:24,490
For you also will be very difficult to know
exactly the measure of creativity.

372
01:16:25,531 --> 01:16:28,313
What is the opposite of creativity?

373
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:41,333
Destructiveness. How much destructive
 a person is? To what level?

374
01:16:42,490 --> 01:16:57,823
In Scotland, this man killed all the children of
 the class. If he had a check-up I'm sure he would be very healthy

375
01:16:57,927 --> 01:17:19,396
in his physical body. Actually he was a gym teacher. Athletic, he was quite healthy.

376
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:31,333
But I'm concerned to bring out
another idea, how we measure health.

377
01:17:34,469 --> 01:17:47,292
And this person measuring health, in this way
 I'm talking about, it might had come out quite sick, quite ill.

378
01:17:50,906 --> 01:18:07,260
It is a different idea all together but we are bringing new ideas, new thoughts in the
 medical science.

379
01:18:07,417 --> 01:18:13,490
Because unless we do that, there is no progress.

380
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:22,427
So I made you think about these ideas and
 as we go along, these ideas will be more
and more

381
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:36,604
clarified and completed in their meaning
 and we may have eventually, a kind of

382
01:18:36,708 --> 01:18:46,063
check-up totally different from the
check-ups we know today.

383
01:18:47,260 --> 01:19:04,896
I'm talking about a machine which evaluates
 your voice, evaluates your look,

384
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:13,563
the texture of your skin, your
answers to certain questions etc.

385
01:19:13,667 --> 01:19:26,646
Then you have a real check-up and you
say the person is healthy or not healthy.

386
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:34,729
Now the society you see it's gone totally
 in the wrong direction.

387
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:52,760
Everything is material but we have the proof in front of us that not everything is material and still the medical profession or

388
01:19:52,865 --> 01:20:04,083
medical education refuses to study the human being; it studies the human body.
