1
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:38,840
So, this is the model and what we can say is that this people here they can live up to 90 year.

2
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:44,610
If everything goes well, if they don't damage their health,

3
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:56,190
they're born with good genetic predisposition and their programming is to live more than 80 years.

4
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:17,170
In this group people will get a common cold or influenza once in a year,

5
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:22,340
once in two years or even once in three years.

6
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:33,600
Actually people with very good health they may not become ill for many years.

7
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:45,340
People who live in mountainous areas, who are farmers, you ask them

8
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,940
and they say "I have never been sick".

9
00:01:55,190 --> 00:02:06,610
The acutes in this is very rare. As they come down they can have more acutes.

10
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:16,770
Now when they go here on this second group the acutes start to be twice a year

11
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:31,520
or three times a year they may have an acute. And here on level 6 we see very frequent acutes.

12
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:47,260
Even children who are having almost every month a cystitis and they get antibiotics

13
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:55,680
and finally the mother says all the year I have to give antibiotics to the child.

14
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:09,100
Or otitis repeated again and again, repeated bronchitis, all kinds of acute situations.

15
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:20,360
Now, what happens usually is that the pediatricians or the doctors who are treating such cases

16
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:28,110
they give antibiotics and at a certain time the child is well.

17
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:36,360
He does not have any more acutes. This a very dangerous situation,

18
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:42,850
would mean the child has gone on level 7.

19
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:50,290
He went down and now his immune system cannot produce any more acutes.

20
00:03:52,040 --> 00:04:10,930
This can happen in early life like when somebody is 10-11 years old where acutes stop

21
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:15,880
and they are not sick with an acute.

22
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:43,600
If such people by good homeopathy are treated while on 7 or 8- rather on 7 I would say-

23
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:52,090
the first thing that happens it will be after the remedy a month later,

24
00:04:52,190 --> 00:05:01,780
20 days later even a few days after correct remedy they start again developing fever.

25
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:14,430
So, that's why we say that if we give a remedy and the person develops a fever

26
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:21,180
immediately after the remedy that is a good sign and it means

27
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:30,780
that the person jumped from level 7 back to 6 or 5.

28
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:43,380
If the person is in these levels or even very down here

29
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:55,890
then it will take long time before you can raise him to this level 6 where he can have again fever.

30
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:04,470
You may treat 2-3 years a person before he shows that he can develop fever.

31
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:21,450
It's very interesting. It does not depend on the age. A person may be old but strong organism.

32
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,130
He can develop fever.

33
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:39,390
A person maybe a young person but his organism is very weak he cannot develop fever.

34
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:56,800
In level 6 the person gets easily acutes. Repeated acutes. They are the cases who never recover.

35
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:05,650
He has a bronchitis and then after two months again another and then after three months again.

36
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:16,650
So, in this level we have acutes which are frequent- levels 5 and 6 - .

37
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:23,540
At a certain moment the acutes stop, has been level 7.

38
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:34,120
Level 7 is not a bad state yet because it may be that with one remedy

39
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:42,060
that you give here fever appears again. That's very good level 7.

40
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:50,290
If you see that you give a correct remedy and fever does not appear

41
00:07:50,390 --> 00:08:00,430
it means that the person will be either 8 or 9 and will need a series of remedies

42
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:05,130
before he can come back.

43
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:19,900
When he comes back from 8 or 9 position to 6 he is going to have a very severe acute

44
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:32,290
and many times life-threatening. And this is the time

45
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:40,710
where you have to be an expert to treat the acute homeopathically.

46
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:51,460
Because if you treat the acute with antibiotics or cortisone things will sink again back

47
00:08:51,560 --> 00:09:07,940
to the lower level which shows that in the most of the cases antibiotics suppress the disease

48
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:23,130
towards a deeper level. Here people can start with being quite strong but they take wrong treatment,

49
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:27,690
they take antibiotics they come down.

50
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:38,920
The more antibiotics the more the health goes down. And they can sink very much down

51
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,270
and reach these levels.

52
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:59,790
As I said in these levels you can have any pathology.

53
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:10,430
That means the fact that the person has Parkinson it does not mean

54
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:18,170
that the pathology will be down here necessarily it can be here

55
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:27,200
which means that the person with Parkinson that from time to time he's able to raise a fever.

56
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:35,510
That Parkinson disease is curable with homeopathy.

57
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:44,020
You see how important it is to know this? Can your system raise fever?

58
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:51,010
That means is your immune system is in good condition then we stimulate it

59
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,710
and we may cure you.

60
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,150
All these things of course are very useful for homeopath

61
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:08,580
but even for non-homeopaths are very useful as well.

62
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:17,990
All doctors actually should understand this model because they must know what they do

63
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:25,990
when they prescribe chemical drugs, the damage they can bring about.

64
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:42,650
It's very interesting that in one congress here,

65
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:54,250
International Congress of Neurology they invited me to speak about the model and they had a fit.

66
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:09,070
Conventional doctors neurologists about 900 of them were in Hilton hotel

67
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:23,670
and I presented this model and I told them and none had any opposition.

68
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:33,150
So, there are quite a lot of other details about this model.

69
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:42,730
The problem is that within a week it's not that everything you learn

70
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:50,540
it is quite a difficult subject, homeopathy.

71
00:12:52,380 --> 00:13:00,530
It's not learned in weekends and you have to apply yourself but once you learn it

72
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:05,640
it's very satisfying in the effects that it gives.

73
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:24,040
That when I am saying high fever I mean from 38,5 C and upwards. This type of fever.

74
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:38,280
Fever between 37C, 37,3C, 37,8C and malaise it shows an immune system which is weak.

75
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,310
Cannot give real fever.

76
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:52,880
This type of fever is the one that determines whether an immune system is in good condition.

77
00:13:53,720 --> 00:14:18,610
Yet, there is one exception that when an organism is on the brink of dying,

78
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:31,440
destroyed when somebody is in the hospital lying down there with a lot of problems,

79
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:40,770
in a very bad condition and you see a high fever arising is not a good sign is not a good fever.

80
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:48,110
This fever is going to be the last it is the last effort of the organism

81
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:57,960
and usually what they do they give antibiotics and the person lives 2-3 days and then he dies.

82
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:06,360
-You're talking about the first groups which can be cured.

83
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:11,280
What can we do with homeopathy in the lower groups?

84
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:24,120
-Usually what we can do is up to here. From here downwards we can ameliorate the situation.

85
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:35,700
We can make them feel more comfortable but really curing them it's very difficult,

86
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,450
if not impossible.

87
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:50,450
You may think a case is 10 or 11 but actually is in level 9 because things are not precise.

88
00:15:50,550 --> 00:16:01,870
This can happen. But here the reaction from the homeopathic remedy is totally different.

89
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:09,300
We'll speak another day about the reactions from the homeopathic remedy.

90
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:13,950
Reactions of the homeopathic remedy in different groups.

91
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:20,790
We'll take one by one groups and I will explain the possible reaction.

92
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:39,530
-If the people doesn't have fever for several years but doesn't have any illness...?

93
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:51,210
-It becomes to the first group. No fever, can be healthy, 1st level.

94
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:05,490
-It's about suppression how the level in this chart if it's the wrong remedy in homeopathy

95
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:11,170
and suppressed by allopathy how is the...?

96
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:34,340
-What happens is this, I will explain it to you. That's one level, not group. Level 4, ok?

97
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:46,180
A person can be on the top of this level with some symptoms, all these are symptoms

98
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:56,340
and when there is an acute or a suppression of whatever remains in the same level

99
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,780
but in the bottom of the level with different symptoms.

100
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:09,690
So actually the homeopathic remedy will bring a person from the higher part of his level

101
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:27,950
to the lower part but cannot make him jump a level. A treatment with real chemical drugs

102
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:35,530
can push the person down to level 5 or 6.

103
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:43,510
But the homeopathic remedy can suppress but within the same level.

104
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:51,760
I want to give you the reactions after the homeopathic remedy of people

105
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:58,250
of the different levels and what kind of reaction we expect

106
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:03,610
and what potency is the best advisable.

107
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:23,350
For the level 1 people you can give any potency preferably very high potency

108
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:29,700
because they have clear pictures and they have strong organisms.

109
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:40,510
In level 1 people you may not expect an aggravation.

110
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:45,180
Usually we say you have an aggravation after we give a remedy.

111
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:56,430
When an organism is quite strong and he comes to you to be treated usually will be for lumbago

112
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:08,110
or sciatica for a common cold, for little and peripheral problems.

113
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:16,280
Therefore you may not expect to have an aggravation with such cases.

114
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:25,370
Potency very high, no aggravation.

115
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:39,780
As you go down to the scale the pathology becomes deeper and deeper.

116
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:51,880
So in level 2 or 3 it will depend on the pathology you may have some reaction, you may not have.

117
00:20:52,630 --> 00:21:00,530
This is another confusion which is within our community.

118
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:16,280
Some teachers they say there are no aggravations and my response to this

119
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:23,900
is "Have you ever seen a real cure in a serious condition?".

120
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:34,890
Most probably they treat people on this level, easy cases, they give a remedy and it's finished.

121
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:42,910
All the other cases they treat they go away they don't know what's happening.

122
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:53,200
So, either they treat such people or they treat only with placebo.

123
00:21:53,660 --> 00:22:07,530
Placebo effect you do not see an aggravation. So either very healthy people or placebo.

124
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:12,440
If some teachers say they have never seen an aggravation

125
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:26,630
that means they have never cured a real case coming down the scale. They don't care.

126
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:45,440
The other thing that you have to have in mind is that when you give a remedy

127
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:48,270
it does not mean it does nothing.

128
00:22:54,370 --> 00:23:01,020
In the example case that we saw, the Mancinella case,

129
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:11,190
he was having babbling sensation in cervical region, he took Lycopodium, it was gone.

130
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:20,450
He was having twitchings in the face he took Nux vomica, twitching was gone.

131
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:27,190
So therefore it is not that our remedy would do nothing if they are wrong.

132
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:33,180
They will something and sometimes they also do damage.

133
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:45,020
As I said there may be suppressing a case within the same level and bring the person down.

134
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:53,100
Because when I say in general dropping of the general state of health

135
00:23:53,200 --> 00:24:05,110
it means general that means energy-wise, less energy, more depression, more anxiety

136
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:21,460
and perhaps less pain in this specific area in which you are treating. That is a suppression.

137
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:29,140
You have a spastic colitis and I have said many times give me any symptom

138
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:39,900
and I will make it disappear because if I give all the remedies fitting that particular symptom

139
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:46,970
the symptom will disappear. What happens to the general state of the patient this is another story.

140
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:57,030
You see how important it is to know what you are doing.

141
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:17,180
And here I'm trying to give you as much information as possible to discern, to find out

142
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:25,900
what is the result of your treatment. So if you do not see reactions here it's ok.

143
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:34,090
But if you come here in these groups where the organism is already compromised,

144
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:46,850
the immune system is in a low state of condition and you are taking such a case from this

145
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:58,520
and within this group you will find from mild to strong aggravations.

146
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:15,170
As you go down, you are treating headaches of the 5th level

147
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:31,110
that means the person still has good immune system to have some high fevers.

148
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:46,440
So level 5 headaches are quite strong headaches and quite frequent., once a week.

149
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:58,410
You give them the remedy and the correct of the remedy is to hear the patient say

150
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:03,500
"I had the worst headache of my life".

151
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:21,560
When you hear that, they call, you know what you are doing and they hear your voice being secure

152
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:33,060
that you know what you are doing and you say "Very good, it is a good reaction!

153
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:40,650
In one or two days you will be free from the headaches

154
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:57,840
-Is that so? Ok." Otherwise they take painkillers.

155
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:09,440
You know the idea this now after the remedy they gave me this "magician"

156
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:17,180
because sometimes they look the homeopath as a kind of a magician he's not a regular doctor

157
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:22,110
though he has studied regular medicine he says this is a magician

158
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:26,370
I went to the magician he gave me this and now I'm worse.

159
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:32,270
The patient will think that I went to the wrong doctor.

160
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:45,770
If that psychology remains and in your voice the patient will hear the least fear

161
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:53,010
"Oh my God what happened", you're finished.

162
00:28:53,110 --> 00:29:00,520
The patient will go to the hospital will take painkillers, will take everything.

163
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:18,680
Once in the 1970s as a student I had a professor of medicine and he was just starting

164
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:24,890
and he was asking me for every case. For every case he would call me.

165
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:40,610
One time he tells me "I have the child of the ambassador of France"

166
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:45,600
because he was speaking French "He has asthma..."

167
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:53,450
I said "Ok give him Sulphur" he says "I cannot give him Sulphur".

168
00:29:53,550 --> 00:30:00,700
I asked why he said because the French doctors when he was in Paris

169
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:08,940
they told him never touch Sulphur because if you touch Sulphur

170
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,290
the child is going to have such an aggravation.

171
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:19,940
Somebody gave him Sulphur the child had an aggravation, they couldn't wait for 2 days

172
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:27,990
and then they gave him all kinds of remedies. What remedies have been given?

173
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:31,090
He says half of the Materia Medica.

174
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:38,320
You know also the French doctors give specialties with mixed remedies.

175
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:45,070
I said to him this was the best reaction and the child would have been cured 5 years ago

176
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:52,070
when they gave him Sulphur but they did not know what they were doing.

177
00:30:52,170 --> 00:31:01,070
And now 5 years the child is with severe asthmatic condition much more difficult to cure now

178
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:05,820
and the reaction was going to be much more difficult so I said to him

179
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:15,900
if you like give him a low potency repeatedly but you expect to have similar

180
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,000
or even worse aggravation. There is no other way.

181
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:28,490
The moment that you don't know what you are doing of course what do you want,

182
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:42,840
to make the asthma a little bit better give all kinds of similar remedies, not the Similimum,

183
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:53,080
not the exact and the asthma will be a little bit better and the child will be a little bit better.

184
00:31:53,180 --> 00:32:01,080
But the child will never be cured. But I have to tell you also this;

185
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:12,830
that this a little bit better in a case of asthma it means that the disturbance

186
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:23,580
which is concentrated upon the lungs is going now to be diffused at the whole of the organism.

187
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:38,990
So therefore as much as the asthma is better the same amount will be worse the energy, the anxiety,

188
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:43,830
the depression or whatever is diffused in the whole organism

189
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:52,420
because the organism is one there are no parts.

190
00:32:54,180 --> 00:33:02,790
It works as a totality so you stimulate and the stimulation is not correct,

191
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:12,000
is not towards cure but towards suppression.  Suppression is not an abstract idea.

192
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:19,660
For the organism suppression means that the relief you get from the local symptom

193
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:30,160
appears as a negative reaction on different other points of the organism

194
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:35,500
to which the person is sensitive.

195
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:52,740
-Asthma is a deadly disease, right? But a child can die from an aggravation.

196
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:57,680
So is it ok than to use allopathic methods during the aggravation?

197
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:09,230
-Of course.  You won't let the child die, you will use. You were here, I think,

198
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:18,060
when I explained how to handle asthma cases. You were not here? You were here?

199
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:36,040
In the previous course I gave a lecture explaining how you handle difficult cases

200
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:56,230
under allopathic treatment. If you are late you see what happens.

201
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:08,930
I sympathize with her because when I was in Canada I could not sleep at all.

202
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:15,670
So I was going to lecture half-asleep because I wanted to sleep during the time I was lecturing.

203
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:25,740
So you can sit there and listen when your biological watch is upside down.

204
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,830
You should be sleeping during this time.

205
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:38,090
So, it's ok, I will give you because this lecture is important

206
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:45,270
so I will ask Dimitri to put the lecture so l can sleep a little bit more.

207
00:35:56,030 --> 00:36:04,920
Here up to here the reaction has no danger.

208
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:20,850
That means the reactions are such that cannot overcome the life force and make a total disaster.

209
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:44,730
But once the  organism has entered a real degenerative state which is not a pathology

210
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:48,170
which has been diagnosed as such,

211
00:36:48,270 --> 00:37:04,920
autoimmune, LPE, RA is not a pathology per se as we know it from conventional medicine

212
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:19,250
that makes a person come to level 7 because in level 7 it can enter a person

213
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:26,440
who just manifests an aggressive high blood pressure.

214
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:40,520
You get some people who feel good but they have an aggressive high blood pressure.

215
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:51,670
It means that they take medication and the pressure is still high in spite of medication.

216
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:57,080
You think what is this? This high blood pressure is nothing.

217
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:07,770
This kind of blood pressure makes a person enter the level 7 or 8.

218
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:19,420
That means that this person from the moment his blood pressure became malignant

219
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:29,430
has stopped giving high fevers, cannot give anymore high fevers.

220
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:45,350
When you prescribe for level 7 if your remedy is correct

221
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:59,140
and if the pathology is not really very deep you are going to have an aggravation immediately

222
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,160
and what else?

223
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:10,750
You are going to have very soon after you prescription manifesting high fever.

224
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,490
That will show you your prescription was correct.

225
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:24,150
It is not correct your prescription when he says my blood was up to 21, 22

226
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:29,480
and did not go down and now with the remedy you gave Lachesis, you gave Belladonna,

227
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:42,060
you gave all the anti-hypertensive remedies that we know and now the blood pressure is 18

228
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:48,730
and says "I'm better". You know that you have done nothing.

229
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:56,400
As an homeopath you realize that the remedy was wrong. But the patient is happy.

230
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:02,140
From 21-22 the blood pressure now is 18, under 20

231
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:14,590
but you know the remedy was only close, not exact.

232
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:27,500
For him to have better state of health he has to have an aggravation

233
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:33,090
and he has to manifest also fever.

234
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:56,250
I'll tell you some examples. I was treating 10 years ago a case

235
00:40:56,350 --> 00:41:03,350
with cancer of the head of the pancreas with metastasis.

236
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:21,740
He gave a lot of aggravations in the beginning of the treatment for a year he was terrible

237
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:28,740
the laboratory test was crazy the condition was absolutely dangerous.

238
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:38,990
He had been operated, opened and closed. They said you go and you will live a few more months.

239
00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:46,300
That was the prognosis. And of course he did not have any other chance

240
00:41:46,400 --> 00:42:01,820
so he had to withstand all the aggravations. The man is still alive. 10 or 12 years already.

241
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:19,730
The laboratory tests are normal but I still wait to see the high fever.

242
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:32,380
As long as I don't see the high fever that means I took that man from that level 11

243
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:42,370
and brought it maybe at the 8th level or 7th level where he feels ok.

244
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:47,990
I'm ok now, I'm working, I have a normal life.

245
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:56,900
But if I don't see the high fever I'm not sure that under stress his organism

246
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:09,470
will suddenly go down and explode the cancer which is lurking there.

247
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:18,130
Once I see the fever I say ok you're over there, you're finished with the cancer.

248
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:27,210
Not when the cancer markers are good, it's ok, it's an indication.

249
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:36,570
You know there are cancer markers for different kinds of cancer.

250
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:59,540
I'll tell you another story, just a similar story, ok?

251
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:10,630
Cancer of the breast in a woman, for 10 years trying to cure.

252
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:16,380
Finally she was going back to London, checked, markers ok, everything's ok,

253
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,880
cancer is gone, finished.

254
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:39,550
You're well now. And there comes one time and things happen all together.

255
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:54,390
She separates with her husband, in the meantime she was in love with another man all along.

256
00:44:55,650 --> 00:45:06,550
The man says to her I have to stop the relationship I'm not prepared to separate and go ahead.

257
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:19,400
Another shock, a big shock. She was connected with a kind of spiritual teacher.

258
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:31,220
She discovers the spiritual teacher is a fake. It all happens in June, July, August.

259
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:39,220
In September what was thought to be gone

260
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:49,480
the cancer explodes with a total spread in the organism.

261
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:56,380
I was in America by that time and she was my patient.

262
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:09,130
There was one of my students looking her, and he said let's phone George.

263
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:40,980
She said you must swear to me that you will not phone. That she had decided to leave.

264
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:49,130
The problem was I was watching all the time for the high fever

265
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:58,810
and there was no coming for 10 years treating carefully.

266
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:07,220
The organism looks perfectly healthy but the stress was so much,

267
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:16,970
one stress after another, big stress, big stress, gone the organism finished.

268
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:24,150
After two months she dies. She lasted only 2 months.

269
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:35,910
What I'm saying to you is not a theory, it's the real facts.

270
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:55,460
You treat here there must be an aggravation, you treat number 8 it must be an aggravation,

271
00:47:55,560 --> 00:48:10,320
you treat number 9 you may not get an aggravation anymore but an amelioration.

272
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:20,460
That means number 9 patient is in the brink of being incurable.

273
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:34,050
It is in the middle line, that means the organism improves, he feels improvement,

274
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:47,550
but if this improvement does not lead to a more clear remedy

275
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:56,320
this improvement is going to be a little bit of improvement.

276
00:48:56,810 --> 00:49:05,230
It has to lead to a more clear remedy in order to understand that from number 9

277
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:11,390
is going towards number 8 with a better picture.

278
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:19,960
Because here the picture is very clear, the remedy is very clear.

279
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:25,640
The remedy number 3 is becoming less clear.

280
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:34,140
As you go down the first remedy which you need is less clear,

281
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:42,420
because in these levels you need 2 or 3 remedies to cure.

282
00:49:57,490 --> 00:50:04,890
These are big, strong symptoms, these are smaller and smaller symptoms.

283
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:11,740
All these are modifications of symptoms.

284
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:21,170
This organism has been through a lot of stress because of this lot of stress,

285
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:31,580
this graph shows Ignatia picture.

286
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:43,420
But when this person is on this level 8 or 9 or even 7 underneath Ignatia

287
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:49,520
there are a few more symptoms like Natrum muriaticum.

288
00:50:50,280 --> 00:51:03,670
Nat-m as you examine is not like this underneath, so clear Ign, clear Nat-m.

289
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:20,540
What happens is that as you examine you will see symptoms of Nat-m popping up in the face.

290
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:36,670
If further you will need Sepia or Sulphur you may get a symptom of Sepia as well,

291
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:45,420
or another symptom of Sepia. See, can you recognize now Ignatia here? Very difficult.

292
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:54,020
Because of some symptoms Nat-m there what shall I give, this remedy, that remedy...?

293
00:51:55,030 --> 00:52:03,250
The moment the organism is compromised more and more, more and more levels of remedies

294
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:14,860
you will need which are there, underneath, popping up in the uppermost level.

295
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:35,260
And you have to be experienced and also very logical in your analysis to be able to separate

296
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:44,920
which is the first. Because if you give this remedy as first what you are doing,

297
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:50,840
you are pushing all these over the high picture.

298
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:57,340
Already from a confused case or a difficult case you make it more confused

299
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:02,340
and then it comes Sepia and you give Sepia and you ignore

300
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:07,420
that the first remedy should have been Ignatia never mind how many remedies,

301
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:12,920
half of the Materia Medica you have given the patient is not going to be well

302
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:19,420
unless you give the original, Ignatia.

303
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:26,190
But now after all these remedies you have given the Ignatia picture is gone.

304
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:38,860
Who is going to find out? Not even a master, or a very experienced homeopath.

305
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:50,760
So you have to understand that homeopathy in this respect otherwise you will treat group 1,

306
00:53:50,860 --> 00:54:04,090
be happy with some successes 10-15%, here how many people today,

307
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:12,100
maybe in your countries in south America you have much more on level 1 people.

308
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:23,590
Here in Europe and America and Canada the percentage of these people is the 5% the most,

309
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:28,340
5% of people have remained strong.

310
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:36,190
In South America this group is 50% of the population.

311
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:43,090
So you have good successes with little knowledge.

312
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:50,920
If you know  some remedies well you will be treating more of the people successfully,

313
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:53,420
your success will be quite big.

314
00:54:53,520 --> 00:55:04,250
In Europe you have to be really an expert because we are degenerated.

315
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:10,110
We are going towards extinction.

316
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:43,520
Here in number 6 or number 5 the organism is ready to be infected

317
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:59,500
and very easily with a lot of agents like bacteria, like microbes, like all kinds of viruses.

318
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:18,110
This group is proned to get everything. Therefore if they do not get treated they will die.

319
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:31,100
A huge part of the population of these levels there would be dead unless we had strong drugs

320
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:53,600
like antibiotics, cortisone etc. But they were well with the different epidemics with Tamiflu

321
00:56:53,700 --> 00:57:01,920
and whatever else antiviral or antibiotics etc.

322
00:57:03,339 --> 00:57:17,232
People are getting to life, to stay alive but they are paying the price. And what is the price they are paying?

323
00:57:18,973 --> 00:57:28,493
The price is that after the Antibiotics they drop to these levels.

324
00:57:28,607 --> 00:57:46,007
These levels they allow you to stay alive but with a life which is compromised. In what respect?

325
00:57:46,351 --> 00:58:03,166
First of all joy of life is gone. You loose the joy of life, you loose the pleasure of life

326
00:58:04,424 --> 00:58:12,696
where you were waking up in the morning and were very happy to be in this nice world.

327
00:58:13,093 --> 00:58:21,965
Now you get up in the morning in a depressed stadt, gloomy state. I have not slept well bla bla bla.

328
00:58:22,546 --> 00:58:39,458
You are alive -- that is good. But what are we doing through these means that we have found out to keep an organism alive?

329
00:58:39,746 --> 00:58:55,578
Even in this 12 we have found means to keep people alive. You have a machine that makes you breath.

330
00:58:57,189 --> 00:59:05,654
There is another machine for dialysis were your blood is going through. And there is another machine for the heart which keeps your heart...

331
00:59:06,009 --> 00:59:19,721
And you are in a hospital you have a lot of money and the doctors they feel proud to put all this machinery keep you alive for how long?

332
00:59:19,350 --> 00:59:23,702
For six month, for a year, for a year and a half. I don't know.

333
00:59:25,050 --> 00:59:32,690
The patient themselves most probably on that stage they say "please let me die".

334
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:39,210
Because they are living hell in earth, before their time.

335
00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:51,940
But in these levels we have ways to live and that's why the big issue is euthanasia.

336
00:59:54,370 --> 00:59:56,640
You know euthanasia?

337
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:09,390
And they're debating, should we let these people on these levels die or should we keep them?

338
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:17,030
It's a big issue now. Who has created that issue? Conventional medicine.

339
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:27,290
Because by keeping alive organisms that they should have died normally at the 6th level

340
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:36,270
you keep them alive but in a compromised state. It's a new theory.

341
01:00:36,370 --> 01:00:48,200
I don't know the solution, right? Because I cannot say take out all chemical drugs or antibiotics

342
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:56,690
and let people die normally and in a natural way. I cannot say that.

343
01:00:56,790 --> 01:01:07,780
But I record the facts. The way I understand the facts. Unfortunately,

344
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:16,520
what I record is the experience of somebody that has seen 200.000 cases in 50 years

345
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:19,620
of practicing homeopathy.

346
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:33,600
Don't forget I had a big center with 30 medical doctors

347
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:41,340
and I was supervising there all these doctors and prescribing for cases.

348
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:50,350
The information, the subjects are big.

349
01:01:50,450 --> 01:02:00,350
These results came from a study of a huge number of patients. And from different countries.

350
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:08,850
Because I was treating people in America, in Europe, in India, from every country.

351
01:02:08,950 --> 01:02:12,540
So I know what has happened.

352
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:27,430
The most healthy people are, the areas; South America, you are one of the most healthy,

353
01:02:27,530 --> 01:02:46,350
I don't know how many they accept that, Africa, Asia, Korea. These are the most healthy people.

354
01:02:46,450 --> 01:02:58,440
The most unhealthy where do we find almost every one of these levels in Europe, in America,

355
01:02:58,540 --> 01:03:18,100
in Australia and all the civilized countries. Canada. These are the facts.

356
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:26,840
Try to cure a patient here and you see how difficult it is.

357
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:31,450
This kind of difficulty you will find every time.

358
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:42,940
Because when it comes to this point and you give a remedy you will never see and aggravation.

359
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:49,050
Number 10, you will never see an aggravation. You will see amelioration.

360
01:03:49,150 --> 01:03:58,840
That means the organism is already compromised and says ok you don't allow me to have this pain

361
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:01,950
I will have the pain somewhere else.

362
01:04:02,690 --> 01:04:12,820
That means you will be treating here cases with cancer with metastasis

363
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:23,060
where the pains are excruciating, with metastasis, in the bone especially

364
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:35,010
and you will be relieving the pains but a strange thing will happen

365
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:41,370
that the organism does not stay in one remedy.

366
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:50,770
That means every week you will visit such people with metastasis you will see a new picture

367
01:04:50,870 --> 01:04:56,520
and a new remedy is needed in order to relieve it again for another week

368
01:04:56,620 --> 01:05:10,370
and another week until finally death comes. There is amelioration.

369
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:18,360
Homeopathy can ameliorate that state but not always.

370
01:05:20,870 --> 01:05:30,840
And you have to remember this. For instance in case of an asthma, severe asthma,

371
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:38,270
especially when you have emphysema that means the lungs have given up,

372
01:05:38,370 --> 01:05:48,110
they are not anymore able to breath, bring air in and out.

373
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:55,360
You give the remedy there is an aggravation, the person is going to die.

374
01:05:55,870 --> 01:06:06,120
And you have to enter with allopathic drugs. This lecture is good I will give it to you.

375
01:06:07,610 --> 01:06:21,260
But now concerning the potency here we said the highest potency we start coming down here

376
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:30,620
still 200CH you can give here is a trick.

377
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:47,520
If you get physical pathology in the 7th, 8th level you have to go low, under 30CH or lower.

378
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:59,610
But if the pathology here is psychotic the person is mostly mentally disturbed

379
01:06:59,710 --> 01:07:15,960
then you can go as high as 1M, mental. In physical you will go up to 30CH, 12CH.

380
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:36,290
Here, this group I consider incurable by homeopathy, the 4th group.

381
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:55,030
Here the remedies that will act will be up to 200CH, from 12D or 12X.

382
01:07:55,130 --> 01:08:05,060
D means decimal that means one over ten in the 6th or 12th power.

383
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:17,020
Or X which is the number ten in Latin. And we have 12CH centesimal,

384
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:22,530
one over a hundred in the 12th potency.

385
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:29,530
But the dilutions are made one over 100 they are not one over 10.

386
01:08:29,630 --> 01:08:33,770
This is weaker than this one.

387
01:08:33,870 --> 01:08:45,690
The 12X is a weaker remedy though in 12X you may still find

388
01:08:45,790 --> 01:08:52,280
a molecule of the original substance in this.

389
01:08:52,380 --> 01:09:03,780
In this 1 over 100 in the 12th is going over the Avogadro number

390
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:08,710
and there are no molecules anymore.

391
01:09:08,910 --> 01:09:15,050
-Last year I was here because of heart problem you said you have to wait

392
01:09:15,150 --> 01:09:21,220
and I have a fever after that of 38.5C.

393
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:29,720
If I had a fever again I should treat in homeopathically now.

394
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:36,570
-Yes. He needs to treat the fever.

395
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:52,900
-The question is what is the risk of having another endocarditis.

396
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:55,120
-It's a big risk I tell you.

397
01:09:55,220 --> 01:10:02,120
I will explain I did not say everything but since he reminds me I will tell you

398
01:10:02,220 --> 01:10:08,440
that here as I said there is aggravation and no problem.

399
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:21,700
Here if there is after the second remedy there is a jump from 8 to 6 this case

400
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:26,310
you are going to have a big aggravation.

401
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:33,200
The aggravation is such that sometimes we cannot handle it homeopathically,

402
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:49,200
not because we don't have the remedies but we don't have the knowledge to enter immediately

403
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:58,710
with the first symptoms because the aggravation here is what he says is going to happen.

404
01:10:58,810 --> 01:11:04,450
Is going to be a pericarditis or an endocarditis.

405
01:11:04,550 --> 01:11:14,200
This moment you have to have enough knowledge to control this otherwise it's dangerous.

406
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:21,710
And then therefore what happens is that many times while you treat the fever appears

407
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:32,450
and the reaction appears then get a fright from what is happening endocarditis

408
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:38,710
the symptoms are dramatic, you enter the hospital and has to take antibiotics.

409
01:11:38,810 --> 01:11:46,450
Then antibiotics will push him down again all over so we call it a relapse.

410
01:11:46,550 --> 01:11:52,710
Now he has a relapse because he took the drugs so you start again

411
01:11:52,810 --> 01:11:58,470
but as you start again and again the organism becomes stronger and stronger

412
01:11:58,570 --> 01:12:04,060
and the reactions are not so dangerous eventually.

413
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:12,700
The reactions are manageable by the organism and if the reaction is manageable by the organism

414
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:24,810
the picture of the remedy they give out is clear. And the result can be fantastic.
