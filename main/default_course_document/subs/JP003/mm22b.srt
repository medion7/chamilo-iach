00:00:52,885 --> 00:01:08,902
Lac-caninumについてお話ししましょう。Lac-caninumについての情報を与えます。

2
00:01:38,283 --> 00:01:59,453
Lac-caninumをユニークなレメディーにしているものは何でしょうか？マテリア・メディカで理解すべきことは、重要な箇所つまり各レメディーのユニークな点です。

3
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:29,149
なぜならば、もし文字通りに理解してしまうと、全てのレメディーがほとんど同じ症状を持っている事になりますから。重点や強調すべきところがいくつか存在し、それがピクチャになるのです。

4
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:40,341
Lac-caninumを独特なものにしているものは３点あります。

5
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:58,880
その人は通常「ヘビやクモへの恐怖」があります。そしてその恐怖はとてつもなく強いものです。

6
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:14,801
その人は部屋にヘビがいると恐れたり、ヘビで一杯だと恐れます。「ヘビの夢をみる」「ヘビの幻覚をみる」

7
00:03:14,901 --> 00:03:38,624
ここを強調することでLac-caninumがユニークなものになります。もしこのようなケースを見たら、他にはほとんど何も必要ありません。これほど強い恐怖、妄想、ヘビに囲まれている、という感覚を持つレメディーは他にないのです。

8
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:57,104
子供であれば脅えるでしょう。大人であれば「絵に描いたヘビすら見られない」と言います。TVでヘビを見るのも耐えられません。消してしまうでしょう。

9
00:03:57,204 --> 00:04:23,111
This is the idea of fear of snakes. The second most important element is that symptoms go from one side of the body to the other and they return back.

10
00:04:23,211 --> 00:04:30,537
That means a headache which is one week on the right side, next week on the left side, third week on the right side again.

11
00:04:31,659 --> 00:04:49,923
Pain on the breast which is on the left side, right side, left again. It alternates sides. If that is a pattern, that again makes a case of Lac Caninum.

12
00:04:52,160 --> 00:05:13,643
The third most important thing is that they seem to have a kind of heat in the extremities. Hands, arms and soles are burning and are sensitive to touch, they don't want to touch.

13
00:05:14,624 --> 00:05:29,329
Even the fingers in between them, they will keep them spread apart. The legs, keep them spread apart, they don't want to touch each other.

14
00:05:30,688 --> 00:05:42,549
This heat with the aversion to be touched or the aggravation to be touched belongs again to Lac Caninum.

15
00:05:45,679 --> 00:06:06,144
So Lac Caninum patients therefore, you understand. From these hints you have to understand the character.

16
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,911
Do you understand somebody who says, snakes. What about snakes? I feel that they are around. What is the imagination?

17
00:06:14,272 --> 00:06:34,240
Strong. They have a strong imagination. The idea of having strong imagination, imagining so vividly that snakes are around, that idea becomes important.

18
00:06:37,172 --> 00:06:53,313
And excitable. They will stay in the night and will think about different things in their imagination and all that excitability will keep them awake. Sleeplessness from excitability.

19
00:06:54,614 --> 00:07:02,889
Why? Because of the imagination. They have thoughts that torment them in the night and they are excitable.

20
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:10,805
They think about it and they get more excited and they think more. Then they can not sleep.

21
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:38,525
And then this imagination which is strong will run very easily into delusions. And then during fevers we shall have delusions, which will be around snakes, spiders, cockroaches, that kind of animals.

22
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,387
The Lac Caninum patient can not tolerate, can not stand.

23
00:07:55,797 --> 00:08:10,880
They are people who have a very low kind of esteem about themselves. They are lacking self confidence.

24
00:08:12,928 --> 00:08:26,573
And many times we'll see confusion in the mind, a kind of forgetfulness, memory which is quite weak.

25
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:49,067
It is a mind which becomes tired, the memory becomes weak and they start forgetting. They usually forget when they go to buy something. Every time they buy something, almost every time this is the story as they say, I leave it to the shop.

26
00:08:50,230 --> 00:09:01,319
They don't take it with them so they have to go and get it back. Now the memory is also weak in remembering words.

27
00:09:01,419 --> 00:09:09,983
When they write, the word will not come. They will write another word instead of the word that they want to write.

28
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:20,981
Or they want to use one word and they use another in speaking.

29
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:36,976
The concentration is difficult. And with that state of mind, concentration difficult, imagination strong, memory weak.

30
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:48,455
They have the sense that everybody else is looking down upon them. They have the sense that the others put them down.

31
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:57,931
You are not good. This is the sense they are getting about themselves concerning others.

32
00:10:03,307 --> 00:10:18,161
They are people that because they don't have strong self confidence, they will get irritated easily. But irritability will never last.

33
00:10:18,261 --> 00:10:39,539
It will be over very quickly. Irritability which is over very quickly. And then we have an element which is strange.

34
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:55,360
When you find them in an acute state, they have gone through a fever, they are now over the most of the acute and now they are exhausted.

35
00:10:56,556 --> 00:11:04,689
During that time the exhaustion is so great that they don't want to live. That is the time where Lac Caninum has a loathing of life. They don't want to live.

36
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:20,263
But in their chronic states they have fear death. Strong fear of death and they develop different fears like fear of death which is strong.

37
00:11:20,363 --> 00:11:47,115
Fear of diseases and they have a similar fear with Phosphorus. Fear that something bad will happen. But that something bad concerns mostly the health.

38
00:11:52,533 --> 00:12:16,128
Fear of having brain damage, fear also of heart disease and then we have again fear of thunderstorm not as strong as in Phosphorus.

39
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:48,000
Fear of earthquakes. This is information which comes from Greek cases mostly.

40
00:12:54,763 --> 00:13:09,122
And fear of the dark but only when they are alone.

41
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:51,680
As the pathology progresses, they may go into a state of manic depressive state and in this manic state, they become quite malicious, nasty.

42
00:13:53,109 --> 00:14:13,184
Shouting, cursing. They are quite strong in their expression of rage with a maliciousness, a hatred, nastiness and all these elements.

43
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:30,705
And then after that state they go into depression and during the depression state, they will feel lack of self confidence that everybody else puts them down, they mistrust themselves.

44
00:14:30,805 --> 00:14:45,918
They, for themselves have the delusion that whatever they say is a lie. And also the element that everybody is looking down upon them.

45
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:54,394
That is quite strong.

46
00:14:55,962 --> 00:15:22,261
In children we have easy delusion of snakes and fear of snakes very much and also we have another type that becomes (?) in night time and in sleep.

47
00:15:23,264 --> 00:15:33,483
They start easily and they are very aggressive and cursing.

48
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:54,325
So Lac Caninum is a tired remedy that due to imagination they have, there is a kind of imagination which is very strong and a physical body which is weak.

49
00:15:55,328 --> 00:16:08,732
As a result of that is that within imagination they want to undertake a lot of things. I'll do this and I'll do that. They make a project and they never go through the project.

50
00:16:08,832 --> 00:16:20,947
They don't have the energy to carry through the project.

51
00:16:29,909 --> 00:16:43,392
In general we can say the organism seems weak and if they get a common cold, they may go into coma almost.

52
00:16:44,504 --> 00:17:01,525
It's a comatose state, it's a state which resembles remedies like Muriatic Acid. Very tired and they just don't want to live.

53
00:17:02,464 --> 00:17:15,200
There is a despondency, a state of dissatisfaction of suffering and they just don't want to live.

54
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:28,469
Lac Caninum is usually worse cold but I have found at times that they feel better in cold crispy weather.

55
00:17:30,688 --> 00:17:44,747
When there is snow and the weather is cold and crispy, they feel at their best many times.

56
00:17:53,572 --> 00:18:41,984
Another characteristic is during sleep, they sleep in a position, the one leg forms an angle and the other is straight.

57
00:18:42,955 --> 00:19:03,296
Or they sleep in another position that makes them feel better. It's when they sleep they bring so much the knees to the face, they almost touches the face, curled.

58
00:19:07,477 --> 00:19:19,825
In that very curled up position, they feel best. And we have burning of the soles and burning of the feet and he sticks his feet out of covers.

59
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:33,039
This is usual with Lac Caninum. They don't want the covers to touch the feet. It's almost painful and they are burning.

60
00:19:42,315 --> 00:20:06,672
Another characteristic is that if they have complete darkness in the room, they may have delusions. The darkness makes them have delusions.

61
00:20:08,107 --> 00:20:30,096
And the delusions can be of different type but many times are delusions of faces that make face to them and they are terrified by looking.

62
00:20:52,928 --> 00:21:11,680
With Lac Caninum I have seen also a high cholesterol level with high blood pressure.

63
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:34,493
In such cases we have some kind of sensations going on which are not vertigo exactly like. Lying in bed and at the same time feeling that he is not lying, he is not resting in bed, he is kind of floating.

64
00:21:40,099 --> 00:22:02,588
Also when they walk they don't feel that they walk and touch the ground. They have the delusion as if gliding through the ground, floating.

65
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:28,736
And during these floating sensations and this kind of feelings which are not grounded, then they develop fear of insanity.

66
00:22:29,461 --> 00:22:51,704
Fear that they may be going crazy. In this respect they resemble with Cannabis Indica.

67
00:22:51,804 --> 00:23:06,051
And the floating sensation is very strong also with Calcarea Arsenicosa, with Lachesis also, with Mancinella.

68
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:15,307
With the headaches we'll say that the main characteristic is that the headache goes from one side to the other.

69
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:32,288
Whether the headache is on the side, on the forehead, on the occiput is one side and then the other side. One eye, the other eye and back again.

70
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:51,130
This is very characteristic. The headaches are like Belladonna type of headaches, throbbing usually. Ferrum also has this type of headaches and Glonoinum.

71
00:23:54,688 --> 00:24:09,287
And if you get this kind of headaches, that start from the midnight onwards, then it becomes a characteristic.

72
00:24:09,387 --> 00:24:24,396
Now if the headache, you see now here how we differentiate from one remedy to another, if the headache starts at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, it becomes Belladonna.

73
00:24:25,531 --> 00:24:35,079
If the headache starts 12 o'clock in the midnight and continues, it becomes Lac Caninum and it's the same type throbbing headache, one sided headache, on the right or left.

74
00:24:35,179 --> 00:24:42,603
The only difference is when you observe the headaches over a period of time, you see the alternation usually.

75
00:24:43,413 --> 00:24:57,408
And the alternation does not have to be exact, one time this, one time that side. It might be two times the one side and then again left and then again right.

76
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:09,227
But the pattern more or less what the patient will describe, will be that kind of alternation. It's not going to be exact.

77
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:31,776
One day right temple, after 7 days left. You don't expect to see such kind of endurance. You will have to get the general idea of the patient.

78
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:42,379
Otherwise in Homeopathy we have words to explain. I'm trying to give you the idea of the remedy.

79
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:49,781
Now 500 people maybe you understand in 500 different ways what I'm saying.

80
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:58,991
So when you see a patient you apply this knowledge which I'm giving you in one way or another and that's why videos become important.

81
00:26:01,024 --> 00:26:09,535
Because I have noticed, I did not know, I thought that everybody recognizes once I have spoken of a remedy, he recognizes the remedy and says, OK this is the remedy.

82
00:26:09,635 --> 00:26:27,499
But giving cases on video where I play videos back, I noticed that I go to the class, I say OK now, this can be a case of Natrum Muriaticum? And the class will say yes.

83
00:26:28,715 --> 00:26:42,581
And I say no, it can not be, this is not a case of Natrum Muriaticum. And then I realized that what I have described with words is not a real experience.

84
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,924
The real experience is something different. That's why I say, don't stick with the words.

85
00:26:51,349 --> 00:27:06,859
I said vivid imagination. Just apply that principle of vivid imagination, can you imagine, even try to imagine that there are snakes around you. You can not.

86
00:27:07,605 --> 00:27:18,303
But the Lac Caninum believes that they are here. You say, here is a snake, he looks like that, if there is a snake there.

87
00:27:19,253 --> 00:27:28,597
And he knows that you are bluffing and still the idea is so strong. Now that becomes a symptom.

88
00:28:03,989 --> 00:28:19,349
Headache which comes to the occiput and it is by the time he wakes up. Again it becomes a characteristic of Lac Caninum.

89
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,608
Pain on the occiput on waking. It is as if the whole night is building up, by the moment he wakes the pain is very severe.

90
00:28:33,131 --> 00:28:41,920
Then it becomes a keynote. It is very severe.

91
00:28:45,099 --> 00:29:08,736
Also another keynote is if this pain extends in the forehead and becomes very important for Lac Caninum like also Gelsemium and Sanguinaria.

92
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:24,693
With Sanguinaria what it becomes important is that we usually vomit with such headache. They will get up, go and vomit and they will feel better. That case becomes now Sanguinaria.

93
00:29:29,536 --> 00:29:36,583
With this kind of headache the eyelids will be involved and they will feel really the heaviness in the eyelids.

94
00:29:36,683 --> 00:29:44,939
The heaviness in the eyelids will become prominent and then it becomes characteristic of Gelsemium. We say Gelsemium has heaviness in the eyelids.

95
00:29:46,027 --> 00:29:56,094
It is a paralytic state which continues, which carries on which seals Gelsemium, the paralysis and then when it appears mostly the paralysis?

96
00:29:57,129 --> 00:30:07,275
You see in the eyelids and the eyelids drop. It would be nice if I could sleep now.

97
00:30:16,896 --> 00:30:28,032
You will see one eyelid is paralytic and it is completely done and the legs also will be. Paralysis.

98
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:48,714
You see Lac Caninum will has this headache and his feet will stick out of cover like Sanguinaria.

99
00:30:48,814 --> 00:30:57,122
Sanguinaria also will have this kind of occipital headache, extends to the forehead, feet warm, sticks out of covers.

100
00:30:58,176 --> 00:31:02,961
What is the differentiation point? The vomiting. Lac Caninum will not have vomiting.

101
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:10,272
Sanguinaria will have vomiting and vomiting ameliorates.

102
00:31:28,661 --> 00:31:49,611
Also Lac Caninum can have a headache which may in one day alternate sides. It can start in the morning on the right and goes on the left in the noontime. By the evening it returns to the right.

103
00:32:21,888 --> 00:32:36,454
Lac Caninum will vomit but it will not be the usual thing. With Sanguinaria, it will vomit usually. Sometimes it will not vomit.

104
00:32:37,656 --> 00:32:54,443
Sanguinaria will have headaches but it will not vomit. There will be other characteristics to describe but we say as a main characteristic what is happening is this.

105
00:32:55,474 --> 00:33:19,403
With Lac Caninum we have severe photophobia, sensitivity to light, especially the light of the sun. They don't care about artificial light.

106
00:33:20,427 --> 00:33:41,319
In the ears they have a keynote which is, sounds feel as they come from very far. They do not have the exact sensation from where the noise is coming.

107
00:33:47,563 --> 00:34:07,808
In the nose we have coldness and also alternating discharge. One nostril and then the other.

108
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:22,443
The discharge is green, it is profused discharge. It looks like Kali Bichromicum.

109
00:34:27,392 --> 00:34:51,605
In Lac Caninum you may have sometimes as they swallow, there is some kind of liquids that may go back into the nose, of wrong peristalsis that happens and the liquids come back to the nose.

110
00:34:52,524 --> 00:35:04,960
Obstruction in nostrils. Again one time, one nostril, the other time, the other nostril.

111
00:35:11,189 --> 00:35:33,909
In the mouth we have a characteristic that sometimes food does not taste good for Lac Caninum. No food will taste good but only salty food. Salty food will taste OK.

112
00:35:35,147 --> 00:35:51,249
And also fish is a good food for them.

113
00:35:56,788 --> 00:36:20,096
Also we have a lot of cracking in the jaws as he eats the food, which is a characteristic of some other remedies like Nitric Acid and Rhus Tox.

114
00:36:24,512 --> 00:36:35,193
Again in the throat the same idea, the left side, the right side, the left side.

115
00:36:45,739 --> 00:37:06,048
Lac Caninum is strong in pain in the throat on swallowing the saliva.

116
00:37:11,787 --> 00:37:33,845
I give you only the keynotes. In desires, what we have is a keynote, strong desires about salt with Lac Caninum.

117
00:37:36,149 --> 00:37:47,243
And desires also what kind of drinks? Warm drinks. These two keynotes, desires salt and warm drinks.

118
00:37:50,379 --> 00:38:05,355
In the ovaries we have pains which again alternate sides.

119
00:38:07,403 --> 00:38:22,656
There is a characteristic here which is a keynote, that pains in the ovaries are ameliorated by stressing back the body.

120
00:38:24,363 --> 00:38:39,253
And we have also for the woman flatus from the vagina, initial flat from the vagina which is characteristic in Lycopodium also.

121
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:53,333
Lycopodium and Phosphoric Acid also has that.

122
00:39:02,165 --> 00:39:28,725
Pain in the uterus also that extends upwards. We have an increase in the desire for sex and easy orgasm.

123
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:38,987
But usually they are exhausted after sex.

124
00:39:46,091 --> 00:40:16,149
Different pains, back pains, pains that change place in the back easily. With sciatica we have alternating sides. Alternating pains from hip to hip.

125
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:37,952
This is all you have to remember, there are 3 things.

126
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:51,029
In reality there are certain principles. If you go to all Materia Medicas you will find the same things repeated in different ways.

127
00:40:51,849 --> 00:41:06,460
You grasp the idea of the remedy and then when you see a case, you say now this is case of Lac Caninum. You grasp the idea.

128
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:19,701
You say some peculiarity is there. And then you see it. And then you recognize. That is how you can become good prescribers in Homeopathy.

129
00:41:20,747 --> 00:41:37,457
It is not if you try to go to the letter in the Repertory and try to find a phrase that the patient says, you will never.

130
00:41:37,557 --> 00:41:50,741
Life is something multifaceted, too many levels, too many facets. It's something moving all the time.

131
00:42:17,877 --> 00:42:27,136
You can't have cans with human life, you see? There is a human being there and you can not reduce it to one phrase.

132
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:48,733
You get a Lac Caninum and he will not have this fear of snakes. The imagination will be there, he will not be able to sleep in the night, the anxiety is there, the anxiety about others.

133
00:42:48,833 --> 00:43:03,189
The fear of the disease, the fear that he will have brain stroke, the cholesterol level is high, the blood pressure is high and this is a Lac Caninum case.

134
00:43:04,661 --> 00:43:12,860
And there is no alternation. One time you will see the alternation, the other time you will see the imagination. The one is strong, the other thing is the loathing of life.

135
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:20,939
He does not want to die, he is afraid to die.

136
00:43:25,483 --> 00:43:41,504
What kind of dreams he sees? What does his dream? Snakes.

137
00:43:45,152 --> 00:44:03,741
We're talking about alternating sides. It has been observed that the Lac Caninum can be one day worse in the morning and the next day is worse in the evening.

138
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:15,653
That means whatever he has, he has a pain in the hip which is one day worse in the morning, the next day worse in the evening and again.

139
00:44:17,408 --> 00:44:30,033
That is the idea of alternation. You don't have to have it one side to the other but you have to have it moving in a regular way.
