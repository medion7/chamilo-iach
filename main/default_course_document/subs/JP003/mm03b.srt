1
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:55,360
「死への恐怖とパニック」 途方もないパニックです。

2
00:00:57,749 --> 00:01:10,357
そして「死が近づいているという感覚」、死が目前に迫っている。本には「死の時刻を予言する」と書いてあります。

3
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:24,800
これは急性状態におけるものです。慢性状態では「１０時に死ぬだろう」などとは言わず、別の状態になります。

4
00:01:36,213 --> 00:01:52,747
その人に全ての症状が出るわけではありません。ある人には「死への恐怖」「めまい」「「失神する恐怖」「強烈な？」などが出ます。

5
00:01:56,139 --> 00:02:11,349
他の人には「ふるえ」「発汗」「片側のしびれ」例えば顔の半分のしびれ、などが出ます。

6
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:25,259
また他の人は心因性の呼吸困難が出るでしょう。

7
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:41,707
深呼吸しなくてはなりません。

8
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:50,517
もしくは身体全体や顔が「熱で紅潮」するかもしれません。

9
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:02,293
全般的に悪化する時間帯があり、多くは夜です。

10
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:21,560
特に真夜中から４amです。そして一般的に「暑さで悪化」します。

11
00:03:23,584 --> 00:03:32,629
しかし「寒さから悪化」も時々見られます。例えば８０％は「暑さで悪化」、２０％が「寒さで悪化」です。

12
00:03:36,128 --> 00:03:49,995
(?) by heat, when they are heated up in a very warm room.

13
00:03:51,104 --> 00:04:02,844
(?) individual with intense fear (?) a big syndrome.

14
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:12,124
When the Christ's come then that is the violence, the intensity, then there is the panic, there is the fear, all these are very intense.

15
00:04:12,224 --> 00:04:22,220
When you converse to him, when he describes to you, he will not describe it with this intensity but he will say (?)

16
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:59,392
So these patients are very sympathetic as we said. They need company and also they express their feelings easily.

17
00:05:01,376 --> 00:05:14,368
This sympathetic element leads to a state of anxiety about others. They are concerned very much about their relatives, their friends

18
00:05:15,947 --> 00:05:24,120
and they react out of proportion (?)

19
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:35,339
What happened to you? Oh my God. The reaction is out of proportion to an event.

20
00:05:37,621 --> 00:05:45,899
Because of that element they do not like to hear bad news.

21
00:05:48,523 --> 00:06:00,280
You see they are setting rubrics in the Repertory that we do not see them in the patient, (?) on bad news, we do not see that.

22
00:06:02,197 --> 00:06:13,745
You will have to see it at all fashions. I mean a crisis comes so many times, intense, the fear of death, perspiration, tachycardia etc.

23
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,805
Then they go out, they are sympathetic. It's the whole picture that will make a person Aconite.

24
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:33,856
Anxiety about other people. You have anxiety about others? Yes. You see it's an information which is useless.

25
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:41,557
What we're interested is to get the personality, the essence. Is that Aconite case?

26
00:06:49,259 --> 00:07:00,721
And that is why we need the Materia Medica (?)

27
00:07:06,283 --> 00:07:17,632
In Greece for instance, are you sympathetic? Yes very sympathetic. All Greeks are sympathetic.

28
00:07:18,421 --> 00:07:35,345
OK this is not a symptom because it is (?)

29
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:58,571
Sympathetic is a symptom when the person is really suffering because of the suffering of the others.

30
00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:04,600
And he can not control himself. (?)

31
00:08:08,512 --> 00:08:18,944
The sympathetic is you want to put is as a symptom has to be really suffering because of others and can not help it.

32
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:45,099
I mean if a woman has a child, she is always sympathetic but a Phosphorus woman or the Aconite woman or the Sulphur woman will react completely different.

33
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:59,115
The Aconite in the Repertory says, anxiety about others. What happened, oh my God, what shall we do?

34
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:12,085
It's an intense thing, the anxiety about others. The Phosphorus has completely different (?)

35
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:34,812
Is people OK? He shows all the affection, all the concern, he is interested about you. The Sulphur will not show it, the anxiety.

36
00:09:34,912 --> 00:09:52,320
The Sulphur will say, the child is very (?) They stay awake, they can not sleep.

37
00:09:54,859 --> 00:10:13,611
12.20 (?) does he have an accident? And they get up from bed and they walk up and down, going in the veranda, watching the child coming.

38
00:10:14,187 --> 00:10:19,776
Once they see the child coming, they will go back in sleep.

39
00:10:20,523 --> 00:10:35,947
The Phosphorus do not take this so much imagination. When he feels something which is very (?) then he becomes very sympathetic.

40
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:51,115
If we see the sympathy in a different way, the Arsenicum also has anxiety about others. Anxiety about others in Arsenicum is inner anxiety.

41
00:10:51,627 --> 00:11:02,684
Whom others? Those that he is connected and he feels a kind of security with them, the father, the mother, the brother. What happened to my brother?

42
00:11:02,784 --> 00:11:14,069
Because he holds on him and so he wants him to be well in order to help him.

43
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:25,312
It is an anxiety on a reflex where he wants the support from others and he wants others to be well to support him.

44
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:37,579
It's a different thing in attitude, in personality. (?) anxiety about others it's underlined 3 times.

45
00:11:38,219 --> 00:11:50,400
It doesn't say anything. It is not (?)

46
00:11:58,144 --> 00:12:03,264
So this we are interested to understand.

47
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:31,857
We said the fear of death, that he is going to die now within half an hour, 1,2 hours whatever it is.

48
00:12:31,957 --> 00:12:54,592
But in chronic states the fear of death that is imminent is within a time, let's say in 3, 5 months, in 1 year, they say my heart is going to give in and I'm going to die.

49
00:12:55,061 --> 00:13:01,220
They are actually sure that they are going to die and they make preparation.

50
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:21,927
They make their will and then they tell you that through the symptoms they are absolutely sure that my heart will stop and I'll die.

51
00:13:22,027 --> 00:13:31,221
Therefore I have to arrange everything that after my death everything will be taken care.

52
00:13:32,053 --> 00:13:47,484
I mean this thought is not somebody (?) You say he is a prudent man about his death.

53
00:13:47,584 --> 00:14:04,971
Here we take into consideration everything which is pathological. It's not natural, it's not healthy for one to think that in 3, 5 months I'm going to die.

54
00:14:07,787 --> 00:14:13,419
This is pathology and we take it in consideration.

55
00:14:24,384 --> 00:14:47,424
Except from the fear of death Aconite is also claustrophobia, fear of dark and especially fear of clouds.

56
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:59,720
Many times he will not sleep without the light on.

57
00:15:09,483 --> 00:15:15,157
And he will not go through (?) if he knows that the (?) is going through (?) he prefers to get up.

58
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:33,675
Also you will not get an Aconite going into demonstration, when too many people are in the streets.

59
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:55,307
And they have also a fear of accident. So much so that many times an Aconite will not drive by himself. In order to drive they need somebody else to accompany.

60
00:15:57,675 --> 00:16:04,280
Also Aconite has many times fear of disease and has to be added, it's not in the Repertory.

61
00:16:11,947 --> 00:16:16,448
And also fear that his heart will stop beating.

62
00:16:23,467 --> 00:16:31,765
It appears that those fears are gone and there is the least provocation, and then they come up.

63
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:41,720
In some cases there is an aggravation which reminds you of Lachesis.

64
00:16:42,520 --> 00:17:00,640
And that is when they go to bed and they sleep for 10-15 minutes, then suddenly they wake up with tremendous fears, they jump up.

65
00:17:02,827 --> 00:17:15,029
Now the difference is that with Lachesis the fear is not a fear of death; it's a fear of suffocation when they're falling asleep.

66
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:25,404
By the time they go into sleep. Aconite is a fear of death, is a type which comes 10-15 minutes after sleep.

67
00:17:25,504 --> 00:17:31,307
You see the difference? It looks alike, you may confuse it but it's not the same.

68
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:49,312
It is 10-15 minutes, that means the person has gone into sleep and the moment that the logic mind has gone away, the fears that have been staying inside, they (?) and they (?) suddenly.

69
00:17:50,251 --> 00:17:59,160
And in such an intensity that the person jumps up and he feels he is going to die.

70
00:18:14,613 --> 00:18:24,412
Also there is an aggravation from heat. He may explain it that he is getting warm in bed (?)

71
00:18:24,512 --> 00:18:32,747
That heat aggravates him and brings the crisis of (?)

72
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:43,349
Sometimes these fears instead of making the person to wake up, they appear as nightmares.

73
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:52,032
So they go through tremendous nightmares.

74
00:18:56,021 --> 00:19:04,192
And another fear that can come about is a kind of "mora". You know what is a "mora"? No. I will describe to you.

75
00:19:05,024 --> 00:19:13,216
When they try to wake up or they wake up without being able to move their limb.

76
00:19:15,349 --> 00:19:32,523
What's called this? This can happen with Aconite. They wake up, they can not move their limbs and they go into a state of fright and panic.

77
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:59,595
Anyhow what we observe in general is that the fears that have been (?) they surface very easily the Aconite people and they bring out these states of panic and fear.

78
00:20:20,267 --> 00:20:26,901
The Aconite is also the number 1 remedy that is affected by earthquakes.

79
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:44,928
And it is an analogous state inside, like an earthquake happening. Inside the circulatory system is in such a turmoil as if an earthquake is taking place inside.

80
00:20:53,056 --> 00:21:08,320
Sometimes the feeling of the earthquake inside is so strong that they wake up and they feel that the sea may (?) They have the impression that there is actually an earthquake.

81
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:28,200
It's a tremendous commotion inside and then this (?)

82
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:32,640
a state of Aconite which is terrifying.

83
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:48,907
One of the aggravations of Aconite is this time, the twilight. And I've seen a case of Aconite in a state of agony

84
00:21:49,461 --> 00:22:06,187
coming every night when the twilight comes, where the person will go into tremendous fear in a such a way that (?)

85
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:12,501
Terrified, full of fear, not being able to express anything at the moment.

86
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:23,473
It was terrible experience once that a doctor had. He took the patient inside and while he was in the consulting room, it was about this time

87
00:22:23,573 --> 00:22:35,221
the person started the interview and then suddenly that syndrome came and it was so intense that the doctor terrified.

88
00:22:38,784 --> 00:22:52,757
He said, come in I can not handle the situation. With this syndrome they would call usually the ambulance and give her injection, valium.

89
00:22:53,312 --> 00:23:19,317
It was terrible, the fear. (?)

90
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:31,755
With one dose of Aconite not only that crisis went away. It went away the whole. I mean this woman she was getting very frequently this attack.

91
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:44,340
So Aconite states can start from a million places like tachycardias, (?) and then we see the fear, fear of death, panic

92
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:58,400
tremendous panic and then these terrific fears which come indescribable, they can not say what happens to them and most probably they feel the death is imminent.

93
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:06,144
That they are going to die and they take them to the ambulance.

94
00:24:22,955 --> 00:24:42,197
The claustrophobia also. I remember another case where the claustrophobia was so much that if in the house they were 6 or 7 persons, they would feel claustrophobia.

95
00:24:42,667 --> 00:24:55,659
And she could not stay in that room. She had to leave. Therefore they say, I can not invite my relatives in the house. With 6-7 people she felt claustrophobia.

96
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:03,851
So you understand the intensity of the claustrophobia.

97
00:25:06,795 --> 00:25:18,997
Also there is a fear of suffocation. (?)

98
00:25:21,792 --> 00:25:30,859
And sometimes you will get a fear of open spaces. It's the opposite, exactly.

99
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:45,040
They can not drive into the autobahn. They can drive in the city, they can go anywhere. As soon as they come in the autobahn where the space is open, they go into a panic, into a fear.

100
00:25:45,749 --> 00:25:52,384
They paralyze, they can not drive anymore.

101
00:25:56,331 --> 00:26:06,507
They can not say why this is happening. They go into panic and they can not explain why.

102
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:06,411
We did some characteristics of the different systems.

103
00:27:16,395 --> 00:27:21,360
In general we can say there are tormenting sensations on the head.

104
00:27:22,197 --> 00:27:39,360
Tormenting headaches and vertigo. There is convulsion often and (?) often accompanied by great heat.

105
00:27:40,373 --> 00:27:47,712
There is a very characteristic sensation, void inside the head.

106
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:08,704
There are headaches which can come about after 5 or after exposure to cold, dry winds.

107
00:28:14,379 --> 00:28:26,091
This is characteristic to Aconite. The headaches are located mostly in (?)

108
00:28:28,181 --> 00:28:41,472
One sided numbness of the face, as we said before and these headaches usually are accompanied by some kind of fear, fear of death.

109
00:28:50,944 --> 00:29:01,333
Most probably Aconite will be (?)

110
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:17,120
When the (?) is very hard, the headache is very strong.

111
00:29:18,827 --> 00:29:29,920
When we have severe cases of encephalitis and encephalomyelitis.

112
00:29:34,549 --> 00:29:55,292
In the beginning of such cases we do not have frequently the possibility to treat such cases unfortunately but from my experience

113
00:29:55,392 --> 00:30:07,509
I've seen that Homeopathy definitely can work and ensure better. We do not have the statistics yet that it can work better.

114
00:30:19,093 --> 00:30:26,480
-Have you seen many doctors with good results?
-Yes.

115
00:30:27,627 --> 00:30:43,500
The problem we can not see many cases to have such statistics. We see cases of the child of my sister or the doctors who are in the center, their children.

116
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,747
The children are connected very much with Homeopathy and their parents know very well about Homeopathy.

117
00:30:49,579 --> 00:31:02,827
This is the only time where you can take such responsibility. Also I don't suggest to take such cases especially when we are not medical doctors.

118
00:31:03,701 --> 00:31:18,187
You don't know what to do if the remedy has failed. You may have a difficult situation.

119
00:31:25,205 --> 00:31:40,395
(?) after cold wind, exposure to cold wind.

120
00:31:40,949 --> 00:32:00,768
An inflammation becomes (?) the eyes become very sensitive to light and there is photophobia.

121
00:32:01,557 --> 00:32:27,797
To sunlight and artificial light. Also Aconite may be have sudden loss of sight. If you have sudden loss of sight, it is the beginning of Aconite.

122
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:43,499
In the stomach you can have gastritis inflammation which will come about if somebody is over heated and drinks very cold water suddenly.

123
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:52,267
Then comes this burning in the stomach and the gastritis starts. Then Aconite is (?)

124
00:32:57,195 --> 00:33:13,920
Also they have great thirst. Especially in waking in the morning.

125
00:33:24,352 --> 00:33:33,653
In the abdomen you will find characteristic pains in the abdomen which extend to the chest.

126
00:33:54,325 --> 00:34:14,933
Also (?) retention of urine. The Aconite is very much used in case of (?) because of the (?) that comes.

127
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:25,237
If the urine is retained then Aconite is one of the main remedies.

128
00:34:29,269 --> 00:34:45,717
Sudden bronchitis. Sudden inflammation of (?) in cases of suppressed menses.

129
00:34:52,352 --> 00:35:07,157
But all these symptoms are very well described in Kent and this is one of the remedies which (?) in all these details.

130
00:35:07,947 --> 00:35:25,340
But I would say we are using Aconite say 80% in chronic cases and 20% in acute.

131
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:38,204
We have hundreds of cases treated with Aconite for 5 years, 10 years, chronic cases.

132
00:35:38,304 --> 00:35:51,239
Especially of indescribable suffering. Before we knew this remedy we would give Lachesis, Kali Arsenicum, Belladonna, all other kinds of remedies

133
00:35:51,339 --> 00:36:05,547
that were not acting. And when we came out with the Aconite picture, then we had a great friend in all situations.

134
00:36:23,744 --> 00:36:29,163
Tachycardia, the vertigo, the headaches, the fainting they are not functional.

135
00:36:29,717 --> 00:36:37,013
-I had a case where this lady she would wake up at night paralyzed. She couldn't move, she couldn't touch her husband to wake him up.

136
00:36:47,189 --> 00:37:00,977
-Waking up in the fright of the night?
-Yes and also waking up in the morning just being paralyzed. She couldn't move.

137
00:37:01,077 --> 00:37:08,373
-You mean from "mora", what I said that they can not move their limbs?
-Yes.

138
00:37:16,032 --> 00:37:28,469
-Lachesis, Sulphur.

139
00:37:29,963 --> 00:37:35,239
-In all these cases the crisis is coming and going? They are not constant.

140
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:45,003
-Yes they are not constant situations. They come and go, every 2, 3 days, every day, once, twice the day.

141
00:37:46,859 --> 00:37:57,717
They are not regular crisis but when they come they are intolerable.

142
00:38:07,189 --> 00:38:27,200
This is the idea. It seems that the fright took place. That fright they have it in the subconscious but not too deep and with the least provocation, with some sleep, it comes up.

143
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:40,896
With some thought that something may happen, it comes up. With too much heat, the crisis comes up.

144
00:38:45,717 --> 00:38:55,900
They are going to the wood, they are driving the car, they are in a traffic jam, suddenly they look behind, they get into a panic.

145
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:09,163
-Can they suppress the crisis?
-They can not, no. You mean suppress it by logic? No.

146
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:22,432
It is too strong, they can not. They say, yes I know but when the crisis comes they say, it's impossible to control myself.

147
00:39:26,336 --> 00:39:30,965
-Do you find that the fear of panic is always a fear of death?

148
00:39:31,904 --> 00:39:38,923
-Most of them they will describe it as fear of death, most of them.

149
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:53,771
It's not only the fear of death because in some cases you will get the fainting, you will get the perspiration.

150
00:40:02,005 --> 00:40:13,745
-In Kent's Repertory there is a rubric which says effects of shock or shock in the mental. (?) you would put Aconite into that.

151
00:40:13,845 --> 00:40:18,539
-Yes sure.
-What other remedies would you put in?

152
00:40:19,328 --> 00:40:26,709
-I would put Opium, Gelsemium, Stramonium.

153
00:40:32,341 --> 00:40:39,723
-Arnica?
-When we say shock we don't mean physical.

154
00:40:40,469 --> 00:40:49,244
-You talk about mental?
-Yes.
-A crisis.

155
00:40:56,405 --> 00:41:08,395
-When I give you this idea it's not that I'm covering the whole, because all remedies can have (?) There is no remedy that can be left out of this.

156
00:41:09,184 --> 00:41:13,600
I'm giving you the most prominent.

157
00:41:49,355 --> 00:42:14,336
(?)

158
00:42:15,083 --> 00:42:25,579
-I can not say for what reason a person has a shock. Because he was too sympathetic to the other? Because he felt sudden (?)

159
00:42:29,717 --> 00:42:42,389
Because of different reason? Here the fright is not just a fright. The fright involves most of the time the possibility of death.

160
00:42:43,115 --> 00:42:58,496
This is what I found out. (?) this idea is behind the Aconite causative factor.

161
00:43:10,549 --> 00:43:21,969
In Homeopathy I found out that there is no, always. If you say always, you can forget it. Most of the times, yes but always?

162
00:43:22,069 --> 00:43:33,169
Because you will get sometimes the Calcarea Carbonica who is warm, the Pulsatilla who is cold, the Arsenicum who is also warm, you will get

163
00:43:33,269 --> 00:43:37,067
the Nux Vomica, warm, the Argentum Nitricum who is cold.

164
00:43:41,013 --> 00:43:48,821
You will say but Argentum is suffering from heat, this person is suffering from cold.

165
00:43:49,653 --> 00:43:53,579
How do you get at it? Because the whole picture indicates, it's strong for Argentum Nitricum.

166
00:43:54,197 --> 00:44:01,472
Therefore you have to ignore the fact that this Argentum Nitricum is worse cold.

167
00:44:30,635 --> 00:44:38,955
Another thing that you have to remember is that Arsenicum is very cold in his body but hot in his head, OK?

168
00:44:39,467 --> 00:44:53,013
Sometimes the heat is there and what they say, I'm suffering from heat where the headache is quite warm.

169
00:44:53,632 --> 00:45:22,375
I remember in a hospital in Calcutta, where we had weekends sitting there for watch and the nurse came down, I was with another doctor.

170
00:45:22,475 --> 00:45:35,147
The patient had tremendous pains, he was shouting. So (?) that patient, in India, very warm.

171
00:45:36,000 --> 00:46:08,747
That patient was covered with four blankets, she was holding (?)

172
00:46:09,984 --> 00:46:16,597
And then she was on her top with a fan and fanning her head.

173
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:37,312
When we went inside we saw this patient, water, water and we give him water and she was (?) in the bottle where she was trembling like that and the face was absolutely hot.

174
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:21,664
The picture is so intense and so clear.

175
00:47:35,872 --> 00:47:58,315
When I saw the blankets, 4,5 blankets. So sometimes the person will give you the impression that is hot (?)

176
00:47:59,701 --> 00:48:17,963
There was a case actually by an American doctor who wrote the case and said, this person was warm and I gave Arsenicum.

177
00:48:18,453 --> 00:48:28,736
And he was very angry by the teachers teaching that Arsenicum is a cold remedy.

178
00:48:29,248 --> 00:48:46,080
Anyhow this is not a case where we will say definitely is an Arsenicum case, we still have to see whether it was Arsenicum and secondly whether it was only the head that was warm and not the body

179
00:48:46,592 --> 00:48:48,107
but it is a fact that in Homeopathy I found there is not "always".
