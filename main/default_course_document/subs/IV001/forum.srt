00:00:01,316 --> 00:00:07,619
In this video we will see how to access the forums, create a new topic, reply to a post

2
00:00:07,661 --> 00:00:10,890
and getting email notfications for new posts.

3
00:00:16,533 --> 00:00:22,363
We click the forum icon on the main page of the e-learning platform, to access the forum.

4
00:00:26,603 --> 00:00:32,510
Here we can see the available forums divided in categories, based on the content.

5
00:00:51,316 --> 00:00:55,897
In this column we see the title and a brief description of a specific forum,

6
00:00:56,888 --> 00:01:03,360
in the next column there is the total number of the forum's topics, and next to it the total posts.

7
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:09,109
In the last column on the right, there are information about the last post of the forum,

8
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:12,662
it's title, creator's name and creation date.

9
00:01:17,769 --> 00:01:20,777
This is how the topics of the forum are presented.

10
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:35,855
On top of the list there are the sticky posts, that only the administrators of the platform can create.

11
00:01:36,995 --> 00:01:43,475
In the first column there is the title of the topic, the name of it's creator and the creation date.

12
00:01:43,755 --> 00:01:47,763
In the second column we can see the number of replies of the topic

13
00:01:43,631 --> 00:01:53,442
and again in the last column there are information about the last post and it's creator.

14
00:01:54,302 --> 00:01:56,946
Now let's create a new topic.

15
00:01:57,786 --> 00:01:59,930
We click the new topic button.

16
00:02:06,454 --> 00:02:12,982
A new page opens, in this field we enter the subject of the new topic.

17
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:18,612
Try to create short and comprehensive subjects, so it's easy for someone to understand.

18
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,644
Avoid using subjects like "Help" or "I have a question", instead

19
00:02:24,954 --> 00:02:29,712
use the subject of the new topic to describe the contents of the post.

20
00:02:30,606 --> 00:02:33,939
For example, help with video on children remedies.

21
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:44,624
In the text area you can be more specific and describe your question.

22
00:02:50,868 --> 00:02:53,476
Now we click the save button.

23
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:06,279
As you can see our new topic is presented in the list.

24
00:03:06,876 --> 00:03:11,045
Now we are going to see how to reply on an existing topic.

25
00:03:12,184 --> 00:03:14,584
We select the topic and click on it.

26
00:03:15,192 --> 00:03:19,759
Again you do not have to reply something to everything.

27
00:03:31,247 --> 00:03:36,567
We have two options, we can either reply to a specific post of the topic,

28
00:03:36,766 --> 00:03:39,037
or reply to the initial topic post.

29
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:46,118
For the first option we should click this button, and for the second we just fill out this form .

30
00:03:46,954 --> 00:03:50,186
In this example we are going to reply to a post.

31
00:04:00,113 --> 00:04:06,409
Entering a subject is optional, we add our answer and click the save button.

32
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:19,211
Again you do not have to reply something to everything.

33
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:25,993
Getting email notifications for new posts on topics your are interested in

34
00:04:26,271 --> 00:04:29,847
is one the best features provided to keep us up-to-date.

35
00:04:30,768 --> 00:04:36,908
Inside each topic we see this block where we can select to be notified for new posts for this topic,

36
00:04:37,101 --> 00:04:39,660
or for this forum in general.

37
00:04:39,987 --> 00:04:46,883
Another way to select the forums we want to be notified for new posts, is to go to the user account page.

38
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:54,147
Select the forum notifications tab.

39
00:04:57,734 --> 00:04:59,574
Select the forums tab.

40
00:05:09,645 --> 00:05:13,653
Select the forums that you are intersted the most and click save.

41
00:05:19,369 --> 00:05:22,502
