1
00:00:20,235 --> 00:00:23,460
But the goal is that you look at the page in the Repertory and now listen because this is not the exercise.

2
00:00:28,085 --> 00:00:37,543
The exercise it is a bit more complicated. Please listen two more minutes.

3
00:00:37,643 --> 00:01:08,348
You read on this page every rubric and I expect from you to have any questions on this page.

4
00:01:08,448 --> 00:01:15,068
... you make sure that you understand what it means and second you make sure that

5
00:01:17,429 --> 00:01:23,840
you can imagine how a patient would express this Repertory symptom in natural language to you.

6
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:44,764
Third, if you look at this rubric maybe you say it is so similar to another rubric, what is the difference?

7
00:01:44,864 --> 00:01:48,512
Or why is it positioned here? Why is it written here in the Repertory?

8
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:57,660
Any questions you have about Repertory parts of the symptom, you ask them as well.

9
00:01:59,093 --> 00:02:09,824
And for some people maybe the real incentive will be try to find a mistake on that page.

10
00:02:13,493 --> 00:02:27,985
I give everybody 15 minutes to find the page, to read it, to have a question and then I will ask some people to give one concrete remark.

11
00:02:28,085 --> 00:02:34,833
So I will hear what remarks, questions you have and we will go forward from there.

12
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:53,380
-On 176, chapter generals, sensitiveness externally.

13
00:02:57,781 --> 00:03:11,380
-So you have a rubric sensitiveness, body, bones, cartilages externally, glands internally, medicines, pain, periosteum and remedies.

14
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:18,837
So you have a question about sensitiveness externally. Can you repeat the question now please?

15
00:03:23,317 --> 00:03:31,045
-I'm not quite sure what is external sensitiveness; it means the person is sensitive to external pressures

16
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:41,429
or does it mean the outer sphere of the body, the skin, is sensitive? What does it mean outward?

17
00:03:43,435 --> 00:03:49,152
-Anyone has a reply to the meaning, I will complete the question, if I may.

18
00:03:49,707 --> 00:03:58,603
You have a rubric sensitiveness internally and sensitiveness externally. Anyone has a comment to make on these two rubrics?

19
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:21,031
-I understand this recording to the skin because when you look at the remedies, you see Lachesis for instance.

20
00:04:22,368 --> 00:04:32,843
And Arnica, Belladonna, Apis so that's what I understood.

21
00:04:40,032 --> 00:04:47,484
-Up to now I understood it like the outward sensitiveness refers to things which come from the outside

22
00:04:47,584 --> 00:04:59,317
and influence you just in an external way, like it's too warm, it's too cold, it makes my skin shrink.

23
00:05:00,747 --> 00:05:09,472
Whereas the inward sensitivity refers either to inner organs or to my mind and my feelings.

24
00:05:11,435 --> 00:05:16,775
-Yes you make it more general and I would like to continue the reply, after your reply.

25
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:25,351
There are several rubrics in generals, which have on the third level - you understand

26
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:33,877
general is the first level, sensitiveness is the second level - which have on the third level internal and external.

27
00:05:37,739 --> 00:05:44,017
Even swelling and other rubrics. In other cases it is the same, we perceive the environment by the senses

28
00:05:44,117 --> 00:05:47,915
most of us.

29
00:05:50,368 --> 00:05:57,493
What we perceive from the external world through the senses is the external sensitiveness.

30
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:10,684
Then what we perceive of happening, what is happening within the body is the internal sensitiveness.

31
00:06:22,261 --> 00:06:29,749
I will see if I can find another example.

32
00:06:31,221 --> 00:06:42,869
Trembling, you have the same. Trembling internally and trembling externally.

33
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:52,412
So people may tell you I'm trembling inside. In this case you perceive objectively what is happening outside

34
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:58,741
or feeling of trembling but objectively you don't see it.

35
00:07:00,555 --> 00:07:05,099
That is the difference between internally and externally.

36
00:07:05,931 --> 00:07:12,117
Twichings is the same.

37
00:07:12,864 --> 00:07:20,139
Heaviness internally and externally.

38
00:07:20,928 --> 00:07:30,165
So there are many rubrics where these are opposed the internal and the external sensation in general.

39
00:07:30,955 --> 00:07:35,456
It is in this case again a perception...

40
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,919
-I'm sorry. That is one of the rubrics I never understood.

41
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:44,736
How can you feel heavy outside? It's always for me an inside feeling, Pulsatilla like...

42
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:53,419
-Sepia like, Lilium Tigrinum like...

43
00:07:54,208 --> 00:08:01,077
This is always the point. You have a certain perception of the symptom and something is related and you say, but I don't understand at all.

44
00:08:02,144 --> 00:08:11,281
Until the day a patient comes in and  says, yes I understand you feel inside. No, no, no it's not what you mean, it is different.

45
00:08:11,381 --> 00:08:19,409
And this is very interesting. So if you have this type of symptom heaviness externally, it is different.

46
00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:24,181
So the internally it is related to the internal organs.

47
00:08:27,104 --> 00:08:38,923
I can have feeling of heaviness in the head but I can have a pressure of heaviness onto the head.

48
00:08:41,141 --> 00:08:47,221
So the heaviness is not in my head. I have this impression of heaviness which is coming to my head.

49
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:57,916
Just the same in my bowel. I may have this heaviness internally or I might have this impression of a pressure, heaviness here.

50
00:08:58,016 --> 00:09:13,504
I know and you should be aware that probably 20,30,40 % of the people say, what the hell is he telling now?

51
00:09:14,123 --> 00:09:20,992
What is it making a kind of a difference? Because for you it is very logic to have heaviness of the internal organs.

52
00:09:21,547 --> 00:09:25,408
You understand heaviness in the stomach, heavy head.

53
00:09:26,475 --> 00:09:32,640
And you understand it so well that it is difficult to imagine this little difference of meaning.

54
00:09:33,429 --> 00:09:37,767
But this is normal. We understand the Repertory in steps, in jumps.

55
00:09:37,867 --> 00:09:50,396
And suddenly a patient will come and will explain you no, no, it's not vertigo, it is different. I have no vertigo, it is more a sensation that I'm no stable.

56
00:09:50,496 --> 00:09:56,427
You are looking in the chapter vertigo already and it will explain you the difference.

57
00:09:57,067 --> 00:10:03,168
Be aware that again and again you will be confronted with symptoms in the Repertory

58
00:10:04,064 --> 00:10:10,613
always expressions of the patients, more or less the same, which will tell you something you don't understand.

59
00:10:11,275 --> 00:10:19,281
Because we all have certain limited experience of our own body awareness and senses, perception.

60
00:10:21,195 --> 00:10:26,620
But this is the explanation. So internally the senses inwardly.

61
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,155
Externally the senses outwardly.

62
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:38,908
-(?) because I thought if you are unconscious, you don't have any mental sensibility anyway.

63
00:10:39,008 --> 00:10:45,009
-Yes if you are unconscious, you don't have any mental sensibility anyway, that is correct.

64
00:10:45,109 --> 00:10:58,400
But there is a difference between consciousness and comatose situation.

65
00:10:59,467 --> 00:11:05,547
If you are in a state of coma, you are unconscious.

66
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:13,440
But if you are in a state of unconsciousness, you are not always in coma.

67
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,133
I will give you an example to make it clear.

68
00:11:18,837 --> 00:11:27,697
You came here, you flew down to Skiathos and you were sitting in a restaurant, drinking some kind of Greek beer

69
00:11:27,797 --> 00:11:32,839
then turning to French wine, because that's what you prefer, then you go in the boat

70
00:11:32,939 --> 00:11:38,101
and they say, Alonissos!
Mamamia where was I?

71
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:49,003
And this one hour between Skiathos and Alonissos has just come by. You were not conscious of the travelling.

72
00:11:49,557 --> 00:11:55,388
You were not in a coma but you were just not conscious and that' s why in this rubric

73
00:11:55,488 --> 00:12:02,336
we also have a relation to what is called automatic conduct.

74
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:13,500
You do things, ironing, ironing and ah... it's finished. Two hours. You do things automatically without consciousness.

75
00:12:14,624 --> 00:12:22,268
This rubric, as well, mental insensibility goes in this direction. It is not the loss of consciousness

76
00:12:22,368 --> 00:12:29,237
in the meaning of coma, where you are not only out of your mind but in a way, out of your body

77
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:36,512
it is more the meaning of not being conscious in a sense of not being aware of what you are doing.

78
00:12:44,107 --> 00:12:47,441
-Like day dreaming?

79
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:51,985
-Like day dreaming almost but still a step further because you can be aware that you are day dreaming

80
00:12:52,085 --> 00:12:58,129
and you can even be aware of what I'm telling you while you are day dreaming.

81
00:12:58,229 --> 00:13:08,945
You're thinking all the time of Washington and NY and what you saw in television or you missed but you're still aware.

82
00:13:09,045 --> 00:13:16,177
And I think you pay attention, I'm very happy about but this unconsciousness would mean everybody is out of the hall

83
00:13:16,277 --> 00:13:24,555
and suddenly you say, ah it's finished. So there is a gap in the consciousness.

84
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:36,039
-For example I see the remedy Hyoscyamus and they just sit there and do the same (?)

85
00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:42,225
-Yes it's a lower state of consciousness. It goes inside with that.

86
00:13:47,061 --> 00:13:50,539
You want me to show it? What is the question?

87
00:13:51,413 --> 00:14:05,216
You have self-sufficient impression of importance.

88
00:14:09,227 --> 00:14:19,601
She asked me a question very interesting one. I don't know the page but anyway.

89
00:14:21,515 --> 00:14:35,744
Minds, fear of business. Two remedies.

90
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:48,352
And she says, this rubric is a little bit unclear for me. What is the fear about? To lost business, to do business, whatever?

91
00:14:49,483 --> 00:15:04,721
I must admit I didn't know immediately to reply to this, so I went to the Materia Medica and I typed the word "business".

92
00:15:07,211 --> 00:15:24,917
You remember the remedy was Lilium Tigrinum and I have 5 symptoms which I will show you.

93
00:15:26,027 --> 00:15:40,235
Here is the full text. You must look at this, loss of appetite with headache, distress of the head

94
00:15:41,344 --> 00:15:49,664
(?) to labor, dread of business in this position to any exertion of mind or body.

95
00:15:51,947 --> 00:15:59,115
So it is the mental effort which is implied in doing business, which this person is afraid of.

96
00:16:00,224 --> 00:16:13,585
I agree that in the Repertory the rubric should be completed a little bit to make it clear, that is it the mental effort of business that Lilium Tigrinum is afraid.

97
00:16:13,685 --> 00:16:21,323
In general, if there is something unclear in the Repertory and I admit that there are still many instances

98
00:16:22,155 --> 00:16:30,155
you go to the Materia Medica and you try to find the information over there.

99
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:53,095
-I had mind, fear, calamity and then it was explained misfortune.

100
00:16:53,195 --> 00:17:01,052
-Are you sure calamity is there? Fear of evil.

101
00:17:17,877 --> 00:17:20,380
There is an explanation, did you see what I do?

102
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:37,717
Here there is a little grey square, so there is an explanation of this rubric by our friend (?) from Argentina

103
00:17:38,784 --> 00:17:46,108
and if you click on it, you get the text which explains something from this symptom.

104
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:52,011
(?) did the work of commenting mental rubrics.

105
00:17:57,301 --> 00:18:04,277
You can read it more easily because I have made the letters very big.

106
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:11,104
Basically he says that it is very close to the fear that something will happen.

107
00:18:13,109 --> 00:18:18,784
If we must make a difference between fear something will happen and fear of evil

108
00:18:19,616 --> 00:18:28,299
it will be on the color of the story of the person. It's listening that comes in.

109
00:18:29,152 --> 00:18:32,487
He will tell you that he is afraid that this will happen and that will happen etc.

110
00:18:32,587 --> 00:18:44,121
but the color which is different, evil is like black forces, like devil, like some kind of black magic

111
00:18:44,221 --> 00:18:48,608
like super power which is organizing it.

112
00:18:49,632 --> 00:18:56,032
So it's another fear something may happen but evil is more "doum"

113
00:18:56,224 --> 00:19:04,437
In this case you may prefer use the rubric fear of evil instead of the rubric fear something may happen.

114
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:16,775
-(?) I find remedies there which actually can no do much.

115
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:23,339
-You can always prescribe them. What do you mean?

116
00:19:23,915 --> 00:19:34,887
-(?) use the larger rubric fear of whatever it is and not so much the small sub-rubrics because they are so small (?)

117
00:19:34,987 --> 00:19:45,184
-Yes, this is a very interesting point and I would like to make little parenthesis on this.

118
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:53,717
The use of rubric, of sub-rubric or let's say in other way, the super rubric.

119
00:19:55,808 --> 00:20:06,859
If you look at certain places in the Repertory that you find a remedy in blah, blah, blah morning which is not in blah, blah.

120
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:13,003
Many examples can be quoted.

121
00:20:14,624 --> 00:20:17,724
We will begin historically.

122
00:20:17,824 --> 00:20:26,560
The history is first of all that Kent did not make a mistake, if he said it that way.

123
00:20:27,381 --> 00:20:40,103
Because the idea was that a remedy is added to the rubric mind-fear, if in the proving

124
00:20:40,203 --> 00:20:47,349
or the clinical cases, the remedy has fear, just fear.

125
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:55,143
And then you ask what are you afraid of? Fear, fear, fear, no modality comes.

126
00:20:55,243 --> 00:20:59,147
It comes in fear.

127
00:20:59,979 --> 00:21:06,037
The other reason which Kent mentioned somewhere in his writings, why a remedy is put under fear

128
00:21:06,784 --> 00:21:14,236
is because it appears in at least 3 different fears.

129
00:21:14,336 --> 00:21:22,520
So if someone has a fear of being alone and of the dark and of ghosts, he has fear.

130
00:21:23,723 --> 00:21:28,971
Three sub-rubrics legitimate the presence of the remedy in the super rubric.

131
00:21:29,483 --> 00:21:38,592
Kent wrote this as such and if you enquire the Repertory on the basis of these two rules

132
00:21:39,701 --> 00:21:43,243
you will say, yes but he didn't do it here and he didn't do it there, I agree.

133
00:21:43,989 --> 00:21:48,533
There are a lot of exceptions. But these were the rules.

134
00:21:51,840 --> 00:22:05,344
Now the second point is that some people advocate the systematic copying of remedies from sub-rubrics to super rubrics.

135
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:10,727
If a remedy appears in fear morning, it should be in fear, in fear morning waking it should be in fear.

136
00:22:10,827 --> 00:22:16,587
In fear afternoon drinking tea it should be in fear etc.

137
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:36,433
I must give you a warning by two easy jobs. You take (?) You take all remedies from the sub-rubrics and you make a bigger rubric (?)

138
00:22:36,533 --> 00:22:42,699
That's possible because (?) has quite a few remedies which are not in the main rubric.

139
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:53,095
But take care because if you look under (?), one of the sub-rubrics is aversion to (?)

140
00:22:53,195 --> 00:22:55,669
which is the opposite.

141
00:22:57,163 --> 00:23:05,041
And if you look in the Materia Medica for (?) for each of these remedies, you will see that some of these remedies

142
00:23:05,141 --> 00:23:10,920
they have aversion to (?) and not (?).

143
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:19,563
So if systematically you put all the remedies of the sub-rubrics in the super rubrics again you introduce a lot of mistakes

144
00:23:20,181 --> 00:23:23,808
in the Repertory or in the repertorization.

145
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:28,352
For sure in a systematic  way, it's not a correct way.

146
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:45,212
Then another way comes and people say, you know a typical remedy which has a desire for salt it is Natrum Muriaticum

147
00:23:45,312 --> 00:23:51,760
and I find that in Natrum Muriaticum they often have aversion for salt.

148
00:23:54,037 --> 00:24:02,571
And I believe that probably this can be generalized, if you have aversion for salt, you have something to do with salt.

149
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,944
So you have an aversion and maybe another Natrum Muriaticum has a desire.

150
00:24:07,776 --> 00:24:13,024
You have Phosphorus with a desire for fish and you have Phosphorus with an aversion for fish.

151
00:24:14,517 --> 00:24:21,109
And then they say (?) they have a problem with (?) so maybe they have a desire to (?)

152
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,525
But the same remedy has an aversion for (?)

153
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:33,127
And you can go on. I agree that up to some level maybe it's correct to say

154
00:24:33,227 --> 00:24:41,589
Natrum Muriaticum has an aversion and a desire, has something to do with salt, for this symptom for this remedy.

155
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:52,747
But to generalize this and to say, desire (?) desire rest, aversion to rest, desire to go home, desire to stay home...

156
00:24:53,344 --> 00:25:03,015
restlessness, indifference, it is just extremes of one of the same line, then maybe you need only

157
00:25:03,115 --> 00:25:08,192
500 rubrics in the whole Repertory, you can put it all together and I wonder which remedy you will find.

158
00:25:08,981 --> 00:25:18,560
So I don't believe that you can be following this line of thinking and put remedies in super rubrics because of this.

159
00:25:19,947 --> 00:25:28,053
If you have a proving and several provers they say, I have desire for radishes, desire for radishes etc.

160
00:25:28,288 --> 00:25:31,111
they did not say, they have an aversion.

161
00:25:31,211 --> 00:25:35,015
Maybe the desire is the very interesting point.

162
00:25:35,115 --> 00:25:40,689
If they say, I have an aversion to (?) I think it's game of the mind to conclude that this remedy we can use it

163
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,600
if the patient has (?)

164
00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:52,736
So to copy remedies from the sub-rubric to a super rubric, you should be careful.

165
00:25:55,147 --> 00:26:05,040
On the other hand I must admit, as I told you, that if we look at Kent's Repertory with Kent own rules

166
00:26:05,771 --> 00:26:12,700
that is to say, we put a remedy where it belongs and if it's 3 sub-rubrics

167
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:22,752
we put it in the sub-rubric, a lot is lacking and we will address the issue with some next version of Synthesis.

168
00:26:23,243 --> 00:26:32,401
But be careful because if you have a symptom like fear of death when alone or fear of being alone when thinking of death etc.

169
00:26:34,869 --> 00:26:45,600
it is a very specific symptom, in this combination, in this sub-modalities. Can you find the remedy?

170
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:54,100
And it is a typical symptom for the remedy which is there and if you just put it in fear of being alone

171
00:26:54,200 --> 00:27:00,284
and fear of death, I believe the remedy is in both rubrics, yes it's OK.

172
00:27:00,384 --> 00:27:10,048
But the typical point is fear of death when being alone and we should not globalize, generalize everything.

173
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:30,464
I will speak a little bit about information in the Repertory, Repertory itself.

174
00:27:42,304 --> 00:27:46,791
Everybody is aware there is a lot of interesting information in Materia Medica, we should use Materia Medica etc.

175
00:27:46,891 --> 00:27:51,480
to know the remedies, to confirm the remedies, to differentiate the remedies and so on.

176
00:27:52,736 --> 00:28:00,267
But I want to make you aware that the Repertory carries a lot of very interesting information as well.

177
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:10,680
Just for the single fact that it has been the result of many people's many years work.

178
00:28:11,872 --> 00:28:18,720
To such an extend that it is even complementary, even today to the Materia Medica.

179
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:28,619
Also for the simple reason that it is so easily structured, much more structured than the Materia Medica.

180
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:38,027
Some of you, including myself, maybe they have  done, what we call, extracting a remedy from the Repertory.

181
00:28:38,859 --> 00:28:46,740
You take a typing machine, you go to page 1 of the Repertory and you see a remedy Phosphoric Acidum

182
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:54,033
and you type the symptom anxiety eating apple. Then you go down the page for the next symptom

183
00:28:54,133 --> 00:29:03,477
with Phosphoric Acidum and you find anxiety fever during, you type anxiety fever during.

184
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:13,845
Like this you type all the Repertory symptoms of one remedy and in the end you have the extraction of Phosphoric Acid from the Repertory.

185
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:20,160
What I tell you is that this type of extraction is a very interesting piece of information.

186
00:29:21,056 --> 00:29:30,120
I will show you now in 2-3 min. something which you will repeat.

187
00:29:31,424 --> 00:29:38,869
Write down the instructions stepwise and then you can repeat it to see if you can do it.

188
00:29:39,701 --> 00:29:54,357
The first step is that you decide about a small remedy in which you are interested.

189
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:13,040
For example I'm looking here at rubric abrupt which contains remedy Rauwolfia.

190
00:30:13,984 --> 00:30:17,077
I will first tell you what I do, then why I do it.

191
00:30:17,312 --> 00:30:27,004
The first step is that I make, what is called, the extraction of Rauwolfia, so I drag for the Radar program

192
00:30:27,104 --> 00:30:37,109
in the Macintosh is a little bit different but I drag the remedy to this icon, which is the extraction icon

193
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:51,232
so I drag Rauwolfia to this icon.

194
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:09,515
Second I click here which opens this window and the remedy Rauwolfia is there.

195
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:28,188
Then don't worry to read all this, just look for extract and you extract the whole remedy Rauwolfia

196
00:31:28,288 --> 00:31:37,461
from the Repertory. In one sec you have the 121 symptoms out of the whole Repertory

197
00:31:37,845 --> 00:31:42,261
it starts with mind and it finishes with generals.

198
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:53,420
The first step, the first procedure is make an extraction of a small remedy. A remedy you don't know.

199
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:58,780
If you make an extraction of the remedy...

200
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:09,895
... and it has 1000 symptoms is too much. You chose another one, one you know even less.

201
00:32:09,995 --> 00:32:17,781
Try to find a remedy which has 500 or less symptoms.

202
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:24,544
Any questions about the first step? Extracting very small remedy?

203
00:32:25,099 --> 00:32:36,020
The second step is that you will repertorize this small remedy. How do you do it?

204
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:57,248
You go to edit, select all, all your symptoms become black or blue and then you say

205
00:32:58,549 --> 00:33:20,060
take with intensity one.

206
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:28,096
If you do this, it will start adding all the symptoms to the clipboard.

207
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:36,267
121 symptoms are in the clipboard.

208
00:33:38,699 --> 00:33:52,871
Then you repertorize, you know how to do that, and you find the analysis, you take sum of symptoms, of the symptoms of Rauwolfia

209
00:33:52,971 --> 00:33:57,365
which of course brings out Rauwolfia on the first place.

210
00:33:58,048 --> 00:34:02,016
It covers 121 symptoms.

211
00:34:02,933 --> 00:34:12,747
You repertorize Rauwolfia. I repeat from step 0 before going to the next step?

212
00:34:13,621 --> 00:34:34,677
Step 1 - you extract a small remedy. Step 1a - you decide which is the small remedy you want to extract.

213
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:42,720
Just by looking on the screen and saying this is a remedy I don't know. I take the example of Rauwolfia.

214
00:34:54,795 --> 00:35:12,560
Step 1b - you drag the remedy abbreviation to this icon.

215
00:35:13,696 --> 00:35:18,304
Everybody knows? Someone needs an explanation?

216
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:36,672
If you have a mouse, you push on the left side, you move to the other icon and only when you are there, you release.

217
00:35:55,381 --> 00:36:09,141
I will show it. I push on my left button and I drag the point of the arrow to the extraction icon and I release it.

218
00:36:13,131 --> 00:36:31,548
Step 1c - I click on the extraction icon, click with the left mouse button and I see this screen.

219
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:43,680
Step 1d - don't worry, don't read the screen, just look for the extract button.

220
00:36:50,763 --> 00:37:06,507
You click on this button and it's finished, you have your extraction. 1a, b, c, d. This is making the extraction of the small remedy.

221
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,509
Can I go on to step 2 please?

222
00:37:17,536 --> 00:37:26,027
Step 2 means repertorize the small remedy with totality of symptoms.

223
00:37:28,267 --> 00:37:38,955
Step 2a - you select all the symptoms by going to edit it, select all in the menu.

224
00:37:42,859 --> 00:37:52,640
When you select all, your symptoms turn black, which means they are selected.

225
00:37:53,717 --> 00:38:05,792
Step 2b - you take them into the symptom clipboard by going to take with intensity 1.

226
00:38:06,859 --> 00:38:19,019
Step 2b - you take the 121 symptoms.

227
00:38:20,277 --> 00:38:29,840
You know you have succeeded because here the figure 121 appears.

228
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:48,420
Now step 2c - we repertorize the results and the easiest way is that you quit this window with escape for example

229
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:58,720
and you hit F8, as you usually do, and you have the repertorization.

230
00:38:59,787 --> 00:39:04,480
I would like to continue now to the third step because I'm not making my point.

231
00:39:05,675 --> 00:39:17,777
The third point is suppose you have Rauwolfia and you never prescribed Rauwolfia or not often

232
00:39:17,877 --> 00:39:26,667
and you would like to prescribe it more often. Here is a way which will help you in a very precise manner.

233
00:39:27,819 --> 00:39:33,580
You see that also the other remedies are repertorized and you see that

234
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,821
next to Rauwolfia is written Lycopodium, Phosphorus etc.

235
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:47,687
You will now, as a third chapter of this task, you will compare Rauwolfia to another remedy.

236
00:39:47,787 --> 00:39:56,085
So 3a you decide with which remedy you want to compare your small remedy.

237
00:39:57,259 --> 00:40:02,315
I will give the example of Rauwolfia and Lycopodium.

238
00:40:03,296 --> 00:40:12,021
I want to compare my small remedy Rauwolfia I don't know, with the big remedy Lycopodium I know pretty well.

239
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:25,653
Now 3b we will make the comparison.

240
00:40:26,784 --> 00:40:40,907
What you do is you drag Lycopodium to the extraction icon again.

241
00:40:42,336 --> 00:40:57,800
That's what I'm doing. I open the extraction window one more time.

242
00:40:58,997 --> 00:41:06,101
And now appears not only Rauwolfia but also Lycopodium.

243
00:41:10,261 --> 00:41:21,973
You must read the screen a little bit. I don't exactly the text in German because you must indicate the third option.

244
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:29,824
It is for all languages the third option.

245
00:41:33,344 --> 00:41:36,245
Don't worry about the meaning, when we do it you will understand.

246
00:41:37,269 --> 00:41:48,000
After you see Rauwolfia and Lycopodium click on the third option which will create a list of common and exclusive remedy symptoms.

247
00:41:49,984 --> 00:42:00,587
Then step 3c - you make the extraction.

248
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:08,245
Now listen carefully. Now comes the 4th and the main point.

249
00:42:09,909 --> 00:42:16,117
You will need to study a little bit the result of your work. And it is extremely interesting.

250
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:23,060
Because first you get 80 symptoms in fact which are common to Lycopodium and Rauwolfia

251
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:37,045
and which mean that for a remedy which has only 121 symptoms, there are 80 reasons to confuse Lycopodium and Rauwolfia.

252
00:42:37,835 --> 00:42:45,707
And that there are 80 chances that you miss Rauwolfia because you prescribe again Lycopodium.

253
00:42:48,000 --> 00:43:00,160
To go of this little speech, it is to help you find the way to not miss Rauwolfia.

254
00:43:01,963 --> 00:43:13,540
If you click on these two arrows, you see the next list of the extraction because at the same go at 2-3 sec.

255
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:25,440
the program made common symptoms, which are here, but extracted also the symptoms of Rauwolfia without Lycopodium.

256
00:43:26,603 --> 00:43:33,760
These are the 41 symptoms which contain Rauwolfia but not Lycopodium.

257
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:40,284
And how you will find now a good reason to prescribe Rauwolfia and not confuse it with Lycopodium?

258
00:43:41,963 --> 00:43:53,959
First of all because you know Lycopodium very well and second you read through this list and at a certain moment

259
00:43:54,059 --> 00:44:05,301
in most of the cases, you will find 1,2,3,4,5 symptoms which are opposed to what you know about Lycopodium.

260
00:44:07,435 --> 00:44:14,219
You see for example here... or which are lacking in Lycopodium.

261
00:44:14,731 --> 00:44:22,368
I see here a lot of dreams, drowning, parts of body, teeth breaking off or fracture of jaw.

262
00:44:23,115 --> 00:44:34,279
So there are dreams is dying, accidents. You have a theme you could say, a concept of the remedy which has to do with the fragility of the body.

263
00:44:34,379 --> 00:44:41,973
Which is expressed in these dreams. Lycopodium is not present in this.

264
00:44:42,443 --> 00:44:46,944
Lycopodium does not have this type of idea as the main feature of the remedy.

265
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:58,321
So one feature of Rauwolfia is these dreams about the body falling apart, deteriorating.

266
00:44:58,421 --> 00:45:01,899
Remember this one.

267
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:15,552
We read on, we think of Lycopodium while we read these symptoms, we don't know if Lycopodium is relevant or not.

268
00:45:21,077 --> 00:45:30,720
We read pulse, nothing special and we see another symptom, for those who know Lycopodium

269
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:46,144
a symptom which is absolutely not Lycopodium, sugar aversion. Rauwolfia has aversion to sugar.

270
00:45:46,699 --> 00:45:51,080
How often do you believe you will find this in Lycopodium?

271
00:45:53,040 --> 00:46:01,276
What does it mean? You have your little card on your shelf, in your pockets, in your computer

272
00:46:01,376 --> 00:46:16,267
and you write Lycopodium but aversion to sugar, Lycopodium and dreams teeth breaking off, disease, (?) falling apart ....

273
00:46:17,099 --> 00:46:22,944
In this case you don't prescribe Lycopodium, you prescribe Rauwolfia.

274
00:46:23,776 --> 00:46:36,128
And the 80 reasons, the 80 moments you missed the Lycopodium, you will have a tool to guide you to the prescription of Rauwolfia.

275
00:46:37,195 --> 00:46:39,500
Now everything falls together. You got the logic?
