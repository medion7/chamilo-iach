1
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:36,040
Today before we go into follow ups, I would like to suggest a few things

2
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:44,070
that you could be doing, which are very important with your cases.

3
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,860
In the Materia Medica and in the Repertory, there is a lot of information

4
00:00:54,450 --> 00:01:01,100
that has gone inside without being valid, without being confirmed really.

5
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,360
So we have a bulk of information which stays inside the Repertories

6
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:15,700
and in the Materia Medica without ever using it or if we try to use it, it doesn't work.

7
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:28,670
For instance, Herring's Materia Medica, I found out that gives a lot of symptoms

8
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:39,230
especially when you have peculiar symptoms, which you find actually in the cases

9
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,980
which you are treating.

10
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:47,220
You find the exact symptom, you go to Herring's, to Knerr's Repertory

11
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:59,090
and you find the exact symptom and you give the remedy and almost invariably never works.

12
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:12,710
Which means that for the symptom for which is given one remedy,

13
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:21,460
maybe there are 2,3 or 5 or 20 remedies or the symptom,

14
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:28,960
as it is presented for this remedy is not correct, it's not valid, it's not confirmed.

15
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:43,830
Therefore I had the idea that this material which we use, the Repertory

16
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:49,620
and Materia Medica, should be revised from the very beginning.

17
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:59,880
How it should be revised? And what you can do about it?

18
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:12,960
This is the work of course of a team of doctors or researches.

19
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:23,060
Let us you go to the cases that we have treated here.

20
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:34,950
In these cases there are a lot, as you have noticed most probably, a lot of symptoms

21
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:42,300
that have gone away, that do not belong to the remedy.

22
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:48,200
For instance, an idea which comes from yesterday's case,

23
00:03:48,300 --> 00:04:11,040
he mentioned that aversion tomato went away with Tuberculinum. He mentioned also...

24
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:25,700
-Grinding?
-No, grinding of teeth is in Tuberculinum.

25
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:45,010
If we had the opportunity that you stay here and you start some research.

26
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:52,260
You could, each one of you, go to several of the cases, let's say you take 10 cases each

27
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:58,020
and you look at the case and you check every symptom that the patient says is gone

28
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:04,370
you check it out whether it is in the Repertory or it is not.

29
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:20,030
The basic idea is this: Repertory, then New Symptom, then Confirmed.

30
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:29,190
You go in your case and you check the symptoms that went away

31
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:33,690
whether they belong to the Repertory.

32
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:40,530
If they do belong, it's OK you don't take them into consideration.

33
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:46,450
But you see also another symptom which does not belong in the Repertory.

34
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:54,530
So you write it in this column. You write the symptom and you write the remedy.

35
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:02,600
Then, such a symptom, it will become valid

36
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:10,950
when somebody else in another case confirms this symptom.

37
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:22,680
First of all we have symptoms which are in the Repertory and which are confirmed.

38
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:31,460
I confirm with this case that Ignatia has aversion fruits.

39
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:45,180
This is confirmed that Calcarea Carbonica has aversion eggs... It goes like that.

40
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:51,440
But if aversion eggs is not recorded, you record it here, as a new symptom.

41
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:55,940
Aversion eggs for Calcarea Carbonica and then somebody else comes and says

42
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:00,610
yes I also had a case who did well with Calcarea Carbonica.

43
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:20,980
There was actually in a case where the desire for eggs went away with Pituitary.

44
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:26,570
The desire for eggs (?) which is not recorded.

45
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:37,560
And there was another case, after Silica the desire for eggs came. Whose is this case?

46
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:49,490
After Pulsatilla went away and after Silica came back.

47
00:07:54,150 --> 00:08:02,060
As you may understand, the symptoms which are extremely important,

48
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,550
are symptoms of desires and aversions.

49
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:12,880
They are important and at the same time they are dangerous to use.

50
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:20,120
Why? Because we like to ear something out of habit. You eat too much sweet

51
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:28,880
according to the habit eating sweets and then this is not valid but the moment that

52
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:37,390
desire for sweets goes away, you say desire for sweets is cured with this remedy.

53
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:45,470
Not symptoms as are given in the beginning. I'm not talking about these symptoms.

54
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:51,070
I'm talking about the symptoms are going away after the remedy.

55
00:08:51,170 --> 00:09:01,800
So if we have these columns, first of all in the Repertory we say yes finally and then

56
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:08,620
in the new symptoms we say yes, if it is confirmed once or twice.

57
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:22,460
And eventually if we all organize ourselves into keeping records of that type

58
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:30,300
eventually we will have a reliable information in Materia Medica and Repertory.

59
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:36,050
That's the only way we can do it. From the very beginning.

60
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:45,310
Even symptoms which are in the Repertory and which are in black letters, they have

61
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:49,990
to be confirmed before we can use them.

62
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:07,820
The material at this moment is quite in a primitive state.

63
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:21,890
In this way it can be refined. I proposed that on some discussion groups that we have here.

64
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:34,580
Some committee is elected, an international committee or it can be a few Germans

65
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:43,240
because Germans are more thorough and more hardworking,

66
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:56,570
that this information will go now to the committer and the committee will decide

67
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:04,680
whether it will publish the information in one of the Journals.

68
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:17,250
In this way, the information can be going into different Repertories of the people

69
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:23,820
who will receive the information and you can put a red mark in each symptom

70
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:30,830
that the committee is sending now. New and confirmed.

71
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:36,170
New symptom, confirmed, Repertory symptom, confirmed.

72
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:47,200
Can you imagine how in 10-15 years the material we have it will be cleared up?

73
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:56,990
The question is of course who are the people who can send information

74
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:02,250
and can be taken seriously.

75
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,670
-You!
-I'm not going to do not even one thing.

76
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:21,000
You know how many cases I have seen, you know the files

77
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:31,250
and all that millions of symptoms, which have been recorded.

78
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:37,740
But the problem is that I did not have this idea from the very beginning.

79
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,910
Neither we had video cases from the very beginning.

80
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:48,560
When you are busy, as I used to be, and somebody was coming and saying I'm much better,

81
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:53,400
I didn't care how much better, in what extend and what exactly.

82
00:12:53,500 --> 00:13:00,740
Maybe sometimes I would write down but this information is lost.

83
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,990
I'm much better, placebo go or don't come again.

84
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:25,820
In this way, the committee will know this comes from John D. he is good, he is reliable.

85
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,670
We can take it seriously.

86
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:46,070
Because unfortunately we have to exercise very strict critique in what we are doing

87
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:56,060
because it is so difficult for anybody to check out where this is yes or no.

88
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,090
That we have actually to rely on the integrity of the individual.

89
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:09,240
If he says this is a new symptom, is this really a new symptom or there are other parameters

90
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:16,430
which are happening in the case and the person does not anymore feel this or that symptom.

91
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:25,750
Is it because of the remedy that the symptom went away or is it because some other factors?

92
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:33,290
He fell in love. Dreams of waves...

93
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:45,620
You remember yesterday? Dreams of waves... Ah, Magnesia Sulphurica.

94
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:52,030
Forget it. It's not because of the remedy or because the remedy will take it away.

95
00:14:52,130 --> 00:15:05,620
The dreams of waves will go away once she will settle down a little bit more in her enthusiasm.

96
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:23,270
I consider this work very important for the future of Homeopathy.

97
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:31,190
Because if we have symptoms of the Repertory confirmed

98
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:39,610
and if everybody was working with this idea in mind, in 5 years ,

99
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:47,460
10 years we could have a confirmed Repertory a confirmed Materia Medica.

100
00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:08,020
So who would like to work on this project? There are some people who would like.

101
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:20,530
What I mean is that we may have to establish a committee,

102
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:30,200
which will receive the information and we have to find a way to make it easy

103
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:39,880
for the practitioner to note this information.

104
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,380
Maybe those who write fast in the computer, they can write the whole symptom.

105
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:57,290
One of the problems that will appear it will be the different way

106
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:01,580
of the expression of the same symptom.

107
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:08,660
The patient may say the same symptom but in a slightly more defined way

108
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,930
than it is in the Repertory.

109
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:22,250
So do we have to have the exact expression or do we have to enter it in

110
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:26,010
the expression of the Repertory?

111
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:38,650
These kind of practical problems and what can be proposed, it has to be a committee

112
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:48,110
it has to sit down and discuss the possible modifications of this program.

113
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:56,750
And once this program is settled with details

114
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:03,130
then we publish it in all the homeopathic Journals.

115
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:24,420
It is not possible that we will expect from 1-2 individuals to come out and give everything.

116
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:31,420
It's not possible. Sometimes you know I feel that you are waiting for me to tell everything.

117
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:37,430
It is not possible. I had 10 cases of Myristica, maybe there were some new symptoms

118
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:41,180
of Myristica. I lost them.

119
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,920
But I am prepared if an individual or two, three individuals say,

120
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:53,180
we're prepared to work on this project, I am prepared to let them see all the video cases

121
00:18:53,280 --> 00:19:00,760
and see how they went and what symptoms were cured and go on

122
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:09,940
and confirm or write down the new symptoms. But this requires a lot of time.

123
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:20,340
That is why the medical Universities put the students for a doctor,

124
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:26,790
they say you are doing a doctorate now and they put them to work on the ideas

125
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:34,180
that the Professors have or the students maybe have some ideas.

126
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:42,270
But the student works with the idea that he will get a PhD.

127
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,270
Here, you may work for a Master Degree.

128
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:08,030
Once you have passed the Diploma Degree, you can not jump to the Master

129
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:11,340
without having the Diploma.

130
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:22,460
Do you realize the importance first of all?

131
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:35,780
Do you realize that in the old Repertories, not these ones, I have four in Athens

132
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,040
in each Repertory were written some information.

133
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:45,280
This information was coming from different sources plus my experience.

134
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:51,930
As a result, they took this information, coming from (?) from Boericke,

135
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:55,350
from wherever I found and I said this is interesting information

136
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,860
and I wrote it in the Repertory.

137
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:04,360
Then people came and you know the editions which were circulating for years.

138
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:09,350
Editions of Vithoulkas which were not my editions.

139
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:13,700
They were editions from different sources.

140
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,770
All the Repertories have these editions which are not mine.

141
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:28,600
With which I would disagree. Knowing the structure of a remedy

142
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:39,850
I would be able to say this is not so much fitting with the personality of the remedy.

143
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:52,100
We have to do something collectively to improve the material.

144
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,360
And we need volunteers.

145
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:05,760
Exactly this is what I say that we have at a certain moment cut down

146
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:16,360
from the daily practice and going into research, for the general good.

147
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:22,940
It's not possible to continue in this way.

148
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:33,090
-George you said with several editions by Vithoulkas you disagree.

149
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:40,330
I also asked Frederick (?) this problem.

150
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:48,330
I also asked him about this problem and he told me he may extract from Synthesis

151
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:52,830
all your additions, put is in a letter, send it to you

152
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:58,330
and ask you to confirm these additions or to deny these additions.

153
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:06,640
But he never got an answer by you. To me he said he got no answer.

154
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,280
-The real story is a little bit different.

155
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:18,280
I said, I will make my additions in the mind section.

156
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:26,840
In the mind section I manipulated the degrees, I added, I subtracted etc.

157
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:35,230
But I told him in order to do this, what he was asking, I had to work for months before

158
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:44,200
I could say this is so and so. And still I will not be able to be sure of what I'm saying

159
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:49,900
because it's all by memory or by understanding the remedies.

160
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:57,670
But this is not good enough, it's not this kind of scientific thing which can go on.

161
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:09,730
Can you imagine you have confirmed Belladonnas syndrome of right sided?

162
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:14,230
Confirmed, confirmed, confirmed...

163
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:24,910
What you will get finally in this column here is such symptom of Belladonna confirmed 150 times.

164
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:33,900
You know how useful is that symptom when you hear it and you will have some surprises

165
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:42,650
in this way because symptoms that are there and perhaps in black letters,

166
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:45,160
you will never confirm.

167
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:54,980
On the other hand, you may have a new symptom for Belladonna which can be confirmed 10 times.

168
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,880
It's beautiful, you can rely upon that symptom.

169
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:04,100
Then we can make an Expert System with reliable symptoms.

170
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:12,160
And you can give a tool which will be very accurate.

171
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:22,580
The accuracy of prescribing depends actually on this information.

172
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:30,890
Did I ever give you a prescription without justifying the prescription?

173
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:39,140
I say for this and that. When I say for this and that, usually I pick symptoms which

174
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:50,400
I know are confirmed. That's why I prefer to pick these symptoms, confirmed symptoms.

175
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:55,490
That's where our differences come.

176
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:05,140
And especially in older times when I was speaking in a seminar somebody would say,

177
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:24,390
but this remedy does not have the stitching pain on the second toe which this case has.

178
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:33,660
Where it was a picture of Calcarea Carbonica and you could not find Calcarea Carbonica

179
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,740
in this symptom. And he says, forget it.

180
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:48,390
The one attitude is forget it, why? Because this stitching pain has not been recorded yet

181
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:56,190
with Calcarea Carbonica. With this case starts to be recorded.

182
00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:06,230
Until now I have to say, forget it. Why? Because it has not been recorded yet.

183
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:13,560
But now when you give Calcarea Carbonica and the pain goes away, you record it.

184
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:17,970
Once it is recorded, then it can be confirmed.

185
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:25,480
Then once it is confirmed, especially not by the same individual but by another individual

186
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:31,550
this already becomes a valuable symptom that can go into the Repertory

187
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:35,570
and then confirm it 3rd time, 4th time.

188
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:45,220
Now we have the computers, we have access to more accurate tools.

189
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:57,240
We can do a lot in refining. There is a wealth of information in the cases that you've seen.

190
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:01,400
Let's say you've seen 50 cases. In these 50 cases.

191
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:06,970
Never mind the hundreds of cases which I have on video.

192
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:17,190
The same is with Alf (?) who is doing the video work.

193
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:27,900
I spoke with Alf and I hope they understood the importance of that scheme.

194
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:40,150
-I'm not quite clear about how do you differentiate between suppression

195
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:46,890
and healing of a symptom? What does "go away"mean? You understand what I mean?

196
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:52,210
-That's a good idea which has to be discussed with the committee.

197
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,620
We discussed this, there were several people here, we took decisions,

198
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,400
who is going to do etc.

199
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:12,030
He works with this Repertory and he has some ideas and we try to bring him into that scheme

200
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:16,540
but now it comes the problem.

201
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:28,090
He says, I have done some work, I can do the Repertory, I need 5.000.000 marks to do.

202
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:36,120
When you start with these conditions, we're not going to finish anywhere.

203
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:50,390
Where can we find 5.000.000? 500 yes, 5000 yes but 5.000.000 to clean the Repertory?

204
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:57,290
And I don't believe that an individual even if he has a little team, can do it.

205
00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:02,890
Because you don't get a case of Myristica every day.

206
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:07,630
You may get one in America and one in India and one in Finland.

207
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:19,730
(?) a practionner to find out what the new symptoms of Myristica is.

208
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:31,110
-George on Saturday we talked about the Synthesis with Frederick (?)

209
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:36,870
If I understood correctly, there is more and more information.

210
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:41,540
We were discussing about the quantity and the quality.

211
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,530
And he came with the idea he said, I've been criticized that the quantity

212
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:50,780
or the quality is not what it should be.

213
00:30:50,880 --> 00:31:02,540
My idea is now it's up to you and you go to confirm each time you go to the symptom.

214
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:08,370
From what I understood also since you started teaching us, you always refer,

215
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:14,070
you said show me on the original Kent, if the symptom is present.

216
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:19,780
And you don't seem to trust anything else than this original Kent.

217
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:28,560
So what is the value of something like the Synthesis, where there is a very big information but ...

218
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:36,460
-There is a value. There is a value but we don't know where is the value?

219
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:48,800
For instance when I criticize the kind of "provings" that are done today,

220
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:59,470
dreams and little groups, they give one dose of 12 etc. and they bring out 2000 symptoms

221
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:11,230
in these 2000 symptoms there is a value in 12,10,15 symptoms that might be correct.

222
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:22,120
But which out of 2000. This is my criticism on this kind of provings,

223
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:27,130
where the whole class takes one remedy...

224
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:32,630
If I give you a remedy to prove and each one comes with symptoms,

225
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:38,700
can I take all these symptoms and publish them? This is ridiculous.

226
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:44,220
Now this information has gone in here. Scorpion, chocolate etc. That's one thing.

227
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:50,960
Then dreams. (?) was doing dreams, dreams, all the dreams went there.

228
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:54,530
Some things must be correct.

229
00:32:54,630 --> 00:33:01,620
Because you take a substance and every substance since it can produce symptoms,

230
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:06,380
it can cure them. But which are the symptoms?

231
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:13,130
The Repertories and even worse the complete Repertory has everything

232
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:17,870
that has been published anywhere damned into the Repertory.

233
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:27,300
I said this is a wrong strategy for Homeopathy because you make this Repertory so big

234
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:33,550
with a lot of junk inside. And you will be lost.

235
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:40,330
I will die and this Repertory will be so big and you will be lost.

236
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:46,050
You don't know which remedy to give finally. Because all kinds of remedies will appear.

237
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:51,970
20 remedies will appear all of them, because all of them will have all these symptoms.

238
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:06,880
Tell us, tell us, what to tell you? What I could tell, I said.

239
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:13,060
Further from that point some individuals they have to understand the problem

240
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:18,790
and they have to apply themselves and say, I am available to do this.

241
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:28,460
I am available when we agree together, 5 of us, 10 of us we come here

242
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:37,120
and we discuss in detail what kind of rules this committee

243
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:43,730
should apply for such a refinement.

244
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:54,630
-George we (?) information. Can you make your own Repertory that's wrong?

245
00:34:54,730 --> 00:35:00,380
-Yes. Somebody has suggested, forget all Repertories, you just write your own Repertory.

246
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,380
I will write what you know to be correct. This is not a solution.

247
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:10,970
Because it is not possible for me to know...

248
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:25,210
-George, I'm afraid this idea takes us away from the basic idea for classical provings.

249
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:30,210
Because when you are on (?) and you see in daily practice some symptoms,

250
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:36,710
you have the patients, you don't know if they are over sensitive to the remedy

251
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:41,710
and we give the committee a lot of symptoms which are due only to this patient.

252
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:49,100
And a lot of this information give information in the Repertory, which is reliable at all.

253
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:56,620
-But the committee will make the rules and will say that rule 1.

254
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:06,910
You send the information if the patient has been cured, that means felt much better

255
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:09,370
and these symptoms are gone.

256
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:22,120
Then there is rule 2. You can still send a symptom of a remedy but you will have to state

257
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:33,120
that this symptom was not out of a curative situation, rather from a suppression.

258
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:44,170
So this remedy suppressed that particular symptom which gives you the right to say

259
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:49,620
that there is an affinity between the symptom and the remedy

260
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,610
because it can suppress a specific symptom.

261
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:57,450
A remedy can not suppress a symptom which does not have.

262
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:09,790
For instance, in this case I would take note as new symptom desires bananas.

263
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:26,570
And next to it I would write aversion tomato, Tuberculinum and I would wait.

264
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:29,350
I would wait to see a new case.

265
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:39,480
I have seen Ferrum and Hyoscyamus, both these remedies have aversion tomato.

266
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:46,190
It is a little information but if it is confirmed, it becomes very important.

267
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:50,430
Because the person says, I hate tomatoes, I can't touch them.

268
00:37:53,730 --> 00:38:04,850
Of course you have an individual who eats in this country tomatoes

269
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:10,370
because if there is a country where tomatoes are not known and the individual

270
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:16,010
never has seen a tomato and irritates, maybe he says I don't like it.

271
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:21,270
In the same way, if you go to China and they give you a snake to eat,

272
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:27,380
you will say, forget it. Aversion snakes.

273
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:39,820
They write it as a symptom, aversion snakes or aversion frogs.

274
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:43,430
You know in France they eat the frogs, it's very nice.

275
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:50,680
If you give me frogs and you tell me this is frog, I say forget it. I don't like it.

276
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:56,430
If you give me horse meat, I say forget it, I will not eat it.

277
00:38:56,530 --> 00:39:04,760
But some people they eat the horse and people they eat the cats. In Italy they eat cats.

278
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:10,350
-In Thailand.

279
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:20,600
-In Thailand anyhow. The committee will have to decide on these issues.

280
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:37,450
Also the committee should set the rules for provings. What are the rules for provings?

281
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,670
We still have no rules and anybody can just collect a group of people

282
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:47,450
and just give a remedy and have a proving.

283
00:39:47,970 --> 00:40:08,440
You are having provings like the saliva of owl and you give saliva of owl

284
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:33,620
and symptoms disappear. If I hear that, the person is out. He can not send information here.

285
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:39,620
Owl and whatever.

286
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:51,820
But who will be taking up the challenge I don't know.

287
00:40:54,320 --> 00:41:04,180
If you have possibilities... For instance if in your surgery you have a secretary

288
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:09,440
who is not having so much work, you can always give this work to the secretary

289
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,200
and the secretary can write down.
