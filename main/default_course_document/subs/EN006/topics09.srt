1
00:00:18,475 --> 00:00:30,187
Montagnier is Nobel winner and together with Gallo I think at the same time they found the HIV virus

2
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:40,284
and after that he followed the idea of Benveniste.

3
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:52,036
Benveniste was invited from Temple University in America in a meeting in Bermuda in which I was present

4
00:00:53,915 --> 00:01:07,913
and he presented a research in which he said that the high potency of Apis mellifica

5
00:01:09,321 --> 00:01:18,289
that means over the Avogadro number had similar effect with the real poison.

6
00:01:20,265 --> 00:01:33,713
And what the real poison does when you are stung by bee there are some basophils which are considered to be the defense mechanism

7
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:50,049
and they are mobilized and breakdown and they are supposed to reduce the effect of this sting and it’s the natural defense of the organism.

8
00:01:55,737 --> 00:02:09,489
He claimed that the high potency will do the same, will degranulate the basophils, like the poison does.

9
00:02:12,225 --> 00:02:23,193
I was there and I raised my hand, I was the only one who understood because most of them were professors of different specialties

10
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:34,826
in the gathering, nobody knew Homeopathy he made this claim that a substance that contains nothing, no molecule,

11
00:02:35,274 --> 00:02:44,339
had the same effect as a substance that has molecules and has chemical effect upon the organism.

12
00:02:46,681 --> 00:02:52,401
I raised my hand and I said I am sorry but this cannot happen.

13
00:02:52,962 --> 00:02:57,297
Most probable there is something wrong with what you say.

14
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:14,249
Benveniste was very angry when I said that and he started shouting and I am not a man that will fight.

15
00:03:15,937 --> 00:03:23,585
I thought they may want to hear my opinion, he didn’t want to hear my opinion, it was ok for me, forget it.

16
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:37,106
And the episode was finished by Benveniste who was an allergiologist, professor of Medicine in France,

17
00:03:38,825 --> 00:03:56,569
with high prestige and he asked all these very influential scientists that were present in the gathering to press “Nature”,

18
00:03:57,033 --> 00:04:22,321
it’s number 1 scientific journal in the world, to publish his research. I was terrified.

19
00:04:23,753 --> 00:04:37,538
But there is an inner circle with 24 of us and another circle outside another 150 people attending the meeting.

20
00:04:39,793 --> 00:04:47,457
Between them there was a professor of Allergiology of University of Jerusalem

21
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:54,937
with who we had long discussions concerning Homeopathy.

22
00:04:57,825 --> 00:05:12,722
He had been persuaded by Benveniste to repeat his experiments so when it’s published to say it is confirmed by Jerusalem University and this is so.

23
00:05:14,994 --> 00:05:22,961
When he heard my objection he called me and he said, George what is happening, what don’t you agree?

24
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:40,313
I explained to him why I did not agree because it was very simple; a substance is given and produces certain symptoms.

25
00:05:42,202 --> 00:05:45,570
Disease is given produced certain symptoms.

26
00:05:45,938 --> 00:06:01,682
And high potency is given to alleviate these symptoms, neutralize, cure them not to create the symptoms

27
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:08,073
as if it was a real chemical substance.

28
00:06:12,017 --> 00:06:19,693
If this was true when we prescribed Arsenicum it would have the effect of a poison.

29
00:06:20,197 --> 00:06:32,278
When we prescribe hydrocyanic acid etc… If this idea prevails then it would be terrible for Homeopathy.

30
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:45,605
It would be the end of Homeopathy because they would say the substance produces the same symptoms as the high potency.

31
00:06:46,701 --> 00:06:58,669
The high potency will reverse what the substance is doing, not cause the chemical reactions that are caused

32
00:06:59,037 --> 00:07:10,821
by the disease or the poisoning by a certain substance. Is it clear so far? Cannot happen.

33
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:29,053
It’s impossible to produce with a high potency a poisoning of the body in the same manner that the substance will cause the poisoning.

34
00:07:31,957 --> 00:07:34,701
The idea of Homeopathy is exactly the opposite.

35
00:07:35,173 --> 00:07:51,405
That means the substance is causing a symptomatology and high potency if given the organism is making a reset and eliminates the symptoms.

36
00:07:58,733 --> 00:08:10,053
I told him like that and Professor told me we tried it several times in out laboratories in Jerusalem

37
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:20,549
where we have very good instruments and I could not see what Benveniste was claiming.

38
00:08:21,725 --> 00:08:35,510
Given the fact also that Benveniste was Jewish,  that means the same as the Professor, usually these people support each other,

39
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:47,749
they don’t go against each other, therefore from what you tell me I will withdraw from the experiment.

40
00:08:50,317 --> 00:09:02,749
I said what I am afraid is if this paper is published will backfire for Homeopathy, like it was done.

41
00:09:05,413 --> 00:09:18,126
Nature published the paper under the condition that they will send a committee and Benveniste would have to show them under the microscope

42
00:09:19,437 --> 00:09:30,069
the degranulation of basophils when the 18th potency was put in the solution.

43
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:46,175
So, they went there of course nothing happened and the whole thing came in public and destroyed the reputation of Benveniste

44
00:09:47,247 --> 00:10:01,901
and destroyed also the reputation of Homeopathy because they connected the failure of this experiments with the failure of Homeopathy.

45
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:16,733
That was happening by 1988-1989. In the meantime I was in America, teaching there,

46
00:10:17,397 --> 00:10:25,214
and I had persuaded several centers to start research with Homeopathy.

47
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:36,925
After this scandal broke out all these people they had agreed with me to do research they would withdraw

48
00:10:39,437 --> 00:10:49,093
because Benveniste lost his position in the university, he lost his laboratory, and he lost the support of Boiron,

49
00:10:49,949 --> 00:11:08,493
who was financially supporting him, and he was in a terrible state. But what happened; a journalist from N.Y. Times

50
00:11:09,885 --> 00:11:20,523
who took this from “Nature” he wrote most probably “water has memory”.

51
00:11:21,923 --> 00:11:30,643
You must have heard “the memory of the water”. Who has heard it? Everybody knows and you believe it.

52
00:11:35,467 --> 00:11:48,883
What actually happens is that the memory of the water was not the idea of Benveniste it was an idea of a journalist

53
00:11:51,603 --> 00:12:07,331
which was taken later on by the media who wanted to show people how ridiculous homeopaths are.

54
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:20,273
The dilute one drop in the ocean and then they claim that this drop in the ocean can have an effect.

55
00:12:24,249 --> 00:12:43,569
The whole thing was twisted completely because of this experiment that was wrongly presented and conceived.

56
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:50,833
It was a wrong experiment done by somebody who did not know Homeopathy.

57
00:12:53,634 --> 00:13:07,290
And after that until today the media is talking about the ridicule of the “memory of the water” and all that.

58
00:13:10,993 --> 00:13:28,975
All this has an impact on us, who support serious Homeopathy, we have to defend Homeopathy all the time

59
00:13:29,263 --> 00:13:40,799
and explain what is wrong until people come to understanding but then this whole experiment

60
00:13:41,151 --> 00:13:50,463
by single handed delayed the development of Homeopathy in the world. That is the truth.

61
00:13:51,711 --> 00:14:07,207
Now comes Montagnier, he’s a Nobel winner and then he does not know become he didn’t come in contact with an homeopath.

62
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:32,271
He does not mention Homeopathy so much but he has sideways said that what he found out most probably is support for Benveniste experiment.

63
00:14:33,895 --> 00:14:38,911
The Benveniste experiment was repeated by another group of people.

64
00:14:40,575 --> 00:14:59,535
The BBC took part in that second experiment and they said we film all this but if this becomes negative you can forget even talking about Homeopathy.

65
00:15:01,335 --> 00:15:11,936
The next group went there and tries to show under the microscope the degranulation of basophils and they could not show it.

66
00:15:12,735 --> 00:15:19,319
And BBC comes and says forget it, after hundred years you may be start talking again.

67
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:37,263
You see how painful it is for me that I have seen all these cases, the effect, things that you cannot imagine to see

68
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:46,792
say that Homeopathy is nothing because Benveniste has his craziness doing all these.

69
00:15:48,007 --> 00:16:02,111
And now Montagnier comes and he goes much further than Benveniste he would send a signal through the internet

70
00:16:03,287 --> 00:16:18,959
and the signal would affect the DNA and I am terrified of what is going to happen if this becomes public.

71
00:16:19,407 --> 00:16:26,921
Of course people have started ridiculing already him before he goes as far as this.

72
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:43,303
You see it is different the idea of energy medicine in which all kinds of ideas can be inserted because energy is an area

73
00:16:44,095 --> 00:17:01,216
which is not controlled by microscopes, not controlled by devices so therefore there is ample possibility for mistakes and misunderstanding.

74
00:17:02,432 --> 00:17:14,321
So I am afraid Montagnier is going to cause another shock for Homeopathy and another reason for ridiculing Homeopathy

75
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:21,756
and finally what is the truth…

76
00:17:28,473 --> 00:17:37,793
Since a few months I am trying to write a paper together with two biochemists who know Homeopathy

77
00:17:39,552 --> 00:17:47,072
and I hope to be able to complete the paper by the end of September or October

78
00:17:49,937 --> 00:18:05,017
in which we separate the dilution of water from the state of potentized remedy.

79
00:18:06,257 --> 00:18:17,369
It’s two different things when you simple dilution and when you have a potentization process

80
00:18:18,033 --> 00:18:33,921
because there you have information from chemistry which shows how the molecules bond together

81
00:18:34,273 --> 00:18:49,665
through free bonding electrons which exist and create a totally different environment in which the substance

82
00:18:51,769 --> 00:19:10,273
gives its own identity as a structure of the molecules of the water and that new structure by bondage of the molecules

83
00:19:10,825 --> 00:19:21,249
through potentization is a totally different situation than just diluted water.

84
00:19:21,585 --> 00:19:24,817
We don’t dilute a substance in the ocean.

85
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:42,268
We potentize and we increase the energy and the specific energy which comes from the specific substance.

86
00:19:45,717 --> 00:20:00,773
I am writing another paper which explains the Benveniste experiment and what was wrong with it and another paper

87
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:15,029
in which I will explain why the potentized water becomes biologically active water.

88
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:30,940
Forget about the memory because all these supernatural ideas make the things look ridiculous.

89
00:20:32,828 --> 00:20:42,397
Of course if you put salt in the water the water will remember it but it doesn’t mean anything.

90
00:20:44,397 --> 00:21:00,509
What we claim that this water becomes biologically active because it attains a form of energy

91
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:06,980
which is similar to the form of the energy of the body.

92
00:21:13,685 --> 00:21:21,612
Some of you know more or less the facts and you be discussing these ideas.

93
00:21:26,348 --> 00:21:39,868
I am thinking of writing a letter to Montagnier telling him to be careful because he is going for a big problem.

94
00:21:41,684 --> 00:21:48,348
He is heading for breaking his own head against the wall with all these.

95
00:21:49,565 --> 00:21:54,629
We hope this will not happen. We’ll see.
