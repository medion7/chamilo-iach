1
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:25,320
These people who have suffered so much, they can enjoy so much.

2
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:35,290
And then you give back health to the people and they say whatever cost it may worth.

3
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:50,800
It may worth but you know with what cost, you know what I have thought against Medicine,

4
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:57,050
against pharmaceutical industry, against homeopathic pharmaceutical industries,

5
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:04,390
against homeopaths who want to fight me and say George, bad guy, kill him.

6
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:17,790
And still I'm 73, completed 73 and I have this...

7
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:38,970
This passion to teach and to say 'world hear' there is Hahnemann who said this and that

8
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:45,400
and who gave to humanity the best possible boom.

9
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:56,220
But you don't want to listen but when it comes to high places, in Bohn University for instance,

10
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:02,970
in Medical School in Bohn they said to me my dear George come here

11
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:12,480
before you go to start teaching we heard that in Homeopathy you are believing certain things.

12
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,720
I said yes what do I believe?

13
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:24,310
You believe that if somebody looks like an animal, you give animal remedies.

14
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,450
I said no, wait a moment and not only that.

15
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:43,450
He says we hear that there is a remedy which is called 'the Berlin wall' remedy.

16
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:55,700
Not only that, we hear that if you see somebody who wears a shirt with stripes,

17
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,980
you must give him zebra the remedy.

18
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:04,360
And they tell me this, they tell me that...

19
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:09,030
They even told me things which I never knew by that time.

20
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:18,280
I had to apologize for all these things that were going on in homeopathic community

21
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:24,280
before this Professor of Psychiatry and Professor of General Medicine.

22
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:28,060
In the chair I was allowed to teach.

23
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:33,210
In the meantime they heard all these things and they were scared to death.

24
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:38,780
They said he is going to say all these things to the students, to the medical students.

25
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,150
And we are bringing him to teach.

26
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:57,540
I said sir not only I don't believe but fortunately I have the European Journal

27
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:03,050
in which I have written a critic about all this.

28
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:08,380
I said it's not that I'm telling you this now because I want to teach.

29
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:13,780
It is that I have criticized beforehand and here it is the proof.

30
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:18,540
I criticized myself all these things which are going on in Homeopathy.

31
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:23,020
This is not Homeopathy, it has nothing to do with what Hahnemann taught

32
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,620
and what I'm teaching is the pure teachings of Hahnemann.

33
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:43,770
They said OK, go to the amphitheater and of course they found out...

34
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:47,110
I presented some cases, I analyzed the cases

35
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:54,210
that I was in my logical mind, I was not totally crazy.

36
00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:08,510
But again and again when you go to this level, in which people are serious you cannot tell

37
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:18,430
all these nonsense and because of these nonsense I had to receive all the repercussions.

38
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:24,190
These people who tell the nonsense they never deal with these Institutions.

39
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,600
They are just irresponsible, they tell whatever.

40
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,130
Put a water and write Lycopodium and because you wrote Lycopodium 10M,

41
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,200
the water will be Lycopodium 10M.

42
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,040
Drink the water and you will be well.

43
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,850
This kind...

44
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:50,110
Not only that but you play music and the music will be potentized...

45
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,050
Potentized the music...

46
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,450
But I try to keep quiet all these years.

47
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:08,780
Then one time I said that's enough, I have to come publically, to have the proof

48
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:16,770
that prove all these things and I wrote critics which are quite severe in the 'Links'

49
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:24,120
and some other magazines in order to separate myself from this nonsense.

50
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,780
And I carry on my back all these problems.

51
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:34,770
And still I'm fighting instead of saying all this world is useless,

52
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:40,380
you can forget about it, George go and enjoy yourself...

53
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:47,780
I have a little farm with plants, animals, the sea, fish...

54
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:57,350
nice life and why? Why you travel to teach, to inspire people,

55
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:08,960
to show the technique how you can handle these little potencies?
