1
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:22,740
-On behalf of the Swedish Parliament I wish you all happy welcome to Stockholm,

2
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,230
to Sweden and to our old Parliament building,

3
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,400
which dates back to the beginning of this century.

4
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:38,580
Since some years ago it has become a tradition to celebrate the Prize Ceremony

5
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,160
of the Right Livelihood Award in the Parliament.

6
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:49,570
We have in fact a very strict policy concerning non parliamentary arrangements

7
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,830
in the Parliament building.

8
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:59,480
But I will be very glad and proud to welcome the Right Livelihood Award Foundation,

9
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:05,170
as one of the very exclusive exceptions also in coming years.

10
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:13,820
-The Right Livelihood Award Jury honors George Vithoulkas for his outstanding contribution

11
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,830
to the revive of homeopathic knowledge and for his tireless efforts in training homeopaths

12
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:24,330
to the highest standards so Homeopathy can claim a place in science as an effective

13
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:28,570
alternative to other Medical Schools and traditions.

14
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,560
As Director of the Athenian School of homeopathic Medicine,

15
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,810
George Vithoulkas has a team of 30 doctors who practice Homeopathy

16
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,560
while they study under his supervision.

17
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,990
He has established Homeopathy in Greece as a science respected by the medical profession

18
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:49,490
and made his country one of the leading centers for Homeopathy in the western world.

19
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,980
His books 'Homeopathy, Medicine of a New Man' and 'The Science of Homeopathy'

20
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,750
have been translated into 20 languages.

21
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:02,990
In the 'New Model for Health and Disease' he sets a new paradigm for the science of Medicine

22
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:08,230
and numerating the various natural laws that govern the phenomena of health and disease.

23
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:12,500
At present George Vithoulkas is spending most of his time writing a new homeopathic

24
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,990
'Materia Medica Viva' in 16 volumes, including all the contemporary knowledge

25
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:21,720
of his own homeopathic experience from cases which are mostly taken from the Center in Athens

26
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,480
which are over 150.000 cases.

27
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,900
His work with homeopathic teachers now extents to the New International Academy of

28
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,390
Classical Homeopathy established on the Greek island of Alonissos.

29
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:37,390
The first building in the world erected ex novo for the teaching of Classical Homeopathy

30
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:40,890
and stands as prototype for such Centers in other countries.

31
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:45,060
Today the use of Homeopathy is spreading all over the world because it is in many cases

32
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,310
more effective and cheaper than the alternatives.

33
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:51,810
The new studies in medical literature confirm its value.

34
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,760
But the medical establishment remains mostly opposed

35
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:59,140
because homeopathic principles do not fit inside the world view.

36
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,890
They need to be reminded that the Hippocratic oath does not say

37
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:07,140
I shall only heal according to the principles of molecular biology.

38
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,910
Through its practice, teaching and institution building George Vithoulkas has made

39
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:16,140
a major contribution of his generation to the establishment, perception

40
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:21,420
and dissemination of Homeopathy as a science that can have essential contribution

41
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,890
in human health and welfare.

42
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:30,580
It is with very great pleasure that I ask George Vithoulkas to accept the 1996 Livelihood Award.

43
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:11,360
-I'm very proud to welcome you up here. The floor is yours.

44
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:39,460
-Madam, your Excellences,members of the Swedish Parliament, other Award recipients,

45
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:49,060
Ladies and Gentlemen and friends I would like to thank the Right Livelihood Award Jury

46
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:54,160
for honoring me with such a great distinction.

47
00:05:54,930 --> 00:06:05,060
In doing so they have primarily honored Classical Homeopathy itself as well as all my students

48
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:11,830
who have worked with such enthusiasm and dedication towards the proper application

49
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,820
and teaching of this therapeutic system.

50
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:24,310
I claim that diseases of the human race have never been tackled properly by conventional Medicine.

51
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:28,560
On the contrary they have been treated wrongly, suppressively

52
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:33,130
and therefore while the symptoms were masked,

53
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:40,310
the real disorder underneath progressed and finally was pushed to the interior of the organism,

54
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:44,560
which is the central and peripheral nervous system.

55
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:48,810
Let me give you just a few facts to judge for yourself.

56
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:55,560
Multiple sclerosis, a disease that eventually leaves its victims totally paralyzed,

57
00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:01,810
is one which thousands of people are suffering from in the western world.

58
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:11,060
Yet it is entirely unknown to Africans, to Asians or to South Americans

59
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:18,550
who have not had the benefit of the excellency of western Medicine.

60
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:25,720
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a terrible disorder of the neuromuscular system

61
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,640
is also unknown to all these people.

62
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:37,390
Myopathy and muscular dystrophy is the same, known only to western world.

63
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:46,310
Parkinson, which is a rampant disease in the western world is seldom encountered

64
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:48,560
in these countries.

65
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:56,060
Anxiety neurosis, compulsive neurosis and in general mental disorders of a severe nature

66
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:02,810
from which millions of patients are suffering in the western world are almost unknown

67
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:10,420
in these groups that have not had the benefit of modern Medicine and vaccinations.

68
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:17,810
Chorea and the host of other nervous system disorders,like Tourette syndrome,

69
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:23,000
different other nervous disorders are also unknown to these groups.

70
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:28,390
The model suggests that all these chronic diseases

71
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:36,390
including hay fever, asthma, cancer and AIDS are the result of wrong intervention

72
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:40,490
upon the organism by conventional Medicine.

73
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:47,640
It claims that the immune systems of the western population through strong chemical drugs

74
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:55,390
and repeated vaccinations have broken down and finally admitted the diseases deeper and deeper

75
00:08:55,490 --> 00:09:01,270
into the human organism, to the central and peripheral nervous system.

76
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:09,150
In short, this model claims that conventional Medicine instead of curing diseases is actually

77
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:13,640
the cause of the degeneration of the human race.

78
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:24,900
It's very simple for anyone to think that if conventional Medicine would really cure

79
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,140
chronic diseases, today we would have a population in the West

80
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,400
that would be healthy mentally, emotionally and physically.

81
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:44,390
Due to this model I had already in 1970 predicted the appearance

82
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:49,810
of new and incurable diseases of the nature of AIDS.

83
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:55,310
Saying to a group of medical doctors in Athens that if conventional Medicine

84
00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:01,560
continue to use antibiotics the way they did, there would come a time

85
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:08,160
when the immune system would break down and new incurable diseases would emerge.

86
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:16,140
It was an unfortunate but precise and timely prediction of the appearance of AIDS.

87
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:22,150
Today I want to make another prediction that if conventional Medicine

88
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:29,380
does not take notice of what we say and drastically changes practices and its logic

89
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:37,140
in treating with chemical drugs, if it does not also change the direction of its research,

90
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:44,390
soon diseases will go to the center of the organism, which is the central nervous system

91
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:49,240
and most of the population on earth will be mentally ill individuals.
