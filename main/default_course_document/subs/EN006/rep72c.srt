1
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:31,440
We will begin now with a little chapter on the Expert System.

2
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:39,170
Not only for interest for those who have the Expert System

3
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,250
but also for everybody attending this course

4
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,750
because you know George is using the Expert System

5
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:50,740
and maybe I can tell you a few more things, which make it more interesting

6
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:56,850
when you look at the screen to understand more of what is happening.

7
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:09,810
First, you have found and you have selected the correct symptoms.

8
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,660
And we have spoken about that.

9
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,750
Obviously there is some kind of variation.

10
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:19,420
Maybe you put the symptom which is not completed correct

11
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:26,170
but we have discussed finding the correct symptoms and taking them.

12
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,920
That's one thing which is needed.

13
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:36,910
Then second, the VES basically works like different people or different visions

14
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:46,170
looking at the same symptoms, adds it all together and brings forward a balanced suggestion.

15
00:01:46,270 --> 00:02:00,940
However there is one third element and that is the underlining.

16
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:08,810
I will explain you very precisely and schematic the way of the underlining.

17
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:16,760
Underlining of a symptom means that we indicate the intensity

18
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:22,360
which the symptom has from the interrogation of the patients.

19
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:33,750
A patient gives any symptom, desires "mousaka" and what do we ask was it just now

20
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:40,770
this morning or you like "mousaka" every day or every time you come to Greece?

21
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:46,100
No, no mousaka in Greece, mousaka in Munich, mousaka everywhere!

22
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:55,940
So you get the intensity of desire mousaka. That is the intensity from the interrogation.

23
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:11,170
Now the first thing is the frequency of the symptom, how frequent is the desire for mousaka

24
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:16,290
or the pain in the wrist. How frequent it is?

25
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:22,170
The second element is the intensity.

26
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:27,250
How intense, especially for everything which is subjective

27
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:32,620
how intense is the pain in the wrist?

28
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,500
Then when we combine these, you will get a suggestion

29
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,530
on how to underline correctly the symptoms.

30
00:03:47,030 --> 00:04:00,660
The symptoms is underlined once when it is frequently present or intense,

31
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,170
which means when it rises above this level.

32
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:08,430
You remember the drawing here that the symptom has to rise above a certain level

33
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,920
before it is a symptom?

34
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:18,330
So the desire for mousaka has to be sufficiently frequently present to be a symptom

35
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:25,760
or the pain in the wrist has to be sufficiently intense to be a symptom.

36
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:36,320
Everybody has some pain in the wrist some day. It is clearly present. It is a symptom.

37
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:54,360
The underlining 2 when there is a relevant frequency or relevant intensity.

38
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:59,270
It is not just yes I eat mousaka many times.

39
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:06,440
Now it is I eat mousaka every day, when I'm in Greece, whenever I have an occasion.

40
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,690
It is very frequent, more outstanding.

41
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:17,540
This is enough to give it intensity 2 in underlining or when the intensity is outstanding.

42
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,930
It's not just correct that it is present the symptom; it is outstandingly present

43
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:28,190
because of intensity. We give it an underlining 2.

44
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,680
So this is just the symptom is present.

45
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:37,460
This is really frequently present or really intensively present.

46
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:55,290
Then we underline 3 times when the symptom is very frequently present and very intense.

47
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:00,030
It is really overwhelming.

48
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:09,770
Then you know you have 4 degrees in the Repertory and for some reason

49
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:14,770
you have 4 degrees in the intensity of interrogation, as well.

50
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:19,970
The fourth degree in intensity of interrogation,

51
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:25,350
it is like something you wouldn't believe it could exist.

52
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:35,520
It is really so strong, every day, 3 lt of milk, every day for years, it is really very strong,

53
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,700
at least for some people.

54
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:46,750
The fourth degree, as you know, in the Repertory it is seldom. Maybe 200, 250 remedies

55
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:50,610
which have 4th degree in the Repertory.

56
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:59,840
In the totality of your patients, the totality of all the symptoms of your patients,

57
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:07,180
4th degree should be indicated about once in two weeks.

58
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:18,580
You see patients every day, once every two weeks you give a symptom a degree 4th for a patient.

59
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,440
Then you are not exaggerating.

60
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:26,440
Because the whole issue is to underline, as correctly as possible.

61
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,930
So 4th degree is seldom.

62
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:39,760
There are also figures about the presence of 1st, 2nd and 3rd degree

63
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:45,250
and the idea is the higher you go, the less the symptoms can have a 2nd

64
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:49,350
or 3rd degree of underlining.

65
00:07:52,100 --> 00:08:02,250
It is something like if 80% of the symptoms have a 1st underlining or less it's OK.

66
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:06,020
If more, you will get a message when you use the system and you will see...

67
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,090
change the underline etc.

68
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:20,020
I think for 2nd degree is about 50% and 3rd degree about 20-25 %.

69
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,950
Of course one patient is not the same as another one.

70
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:31,860
You don't need to think about it. I have already 4 symptoms in the 1st degree,

71
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:36,080
I must have one symptom in the 2nd degree... You don't have to think about it.

72
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:42,580
The program will tell you if you go too far, out of the range which is normally accepted.

73
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,370
And it will tell you, change your underlining a little bit or try to understand

74
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:49,930
underlining in a different way.

75
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:57,710
I give you some hints further to this to try and underline correctly.

76
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:05,500
Of course there will be occasions that you doubt between do I underline twice or three times?

77
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,930
Do I underline once or twice?

78
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:16,760
And you know frequency and intensity are two ways to reflect on this.

79
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:22,500
There is a third, less important feature, which may help you to decide

80
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,260
between 1st and 2nd or 2nd and 3rd underlining.

81
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,360
That is the peculiarity of the symptom.

82
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:42,890
If you doubt and this is more common you will underline it 2, if you doubt between 2 and 3

83
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:48,650
and it is more peculiar you will underline it with 3, to give it more emphasis

84
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,250
because it's more peculiar.

85
00:09:52,990 --> 00:10:01,490
So apart from the schedule, frequency and intensity, the second way is to consider peculiarity.

86
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:08,890
The third thing you must consider is that different people

87
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:14,230
express their suffering in different way.

88
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:23,740
If someone is talking all the time like this, giving a symptom, I had this and I had that...

89
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:31,730
and you say, do you like bananas? Oh yes, I like bananas you put it very high.

90
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:35,040
If someone says, I had all the problems of the world, I fell down the stairs

91
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:39,720
and I went on a boat and I slipped on the boat ....and you say, do you like bananas?

92
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,440
Oh yes, very much.

93
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:47,500
And what about the mousaka? Yes the mousaka is very nice...

94
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:53,230
So if put all these in 3rd degree, no good.

95
00:10:54,260 --> 00:11:02,480
And he is talking and in your job? In my job everything is all right.

96
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:11,630
You've seen that in his flow of intense, so called 3rd degree intensity symptoms,

97
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:17,630
there was a little hesitation and you know what he is going to tell you about the job?

98
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:20,900
All the others, maybe you don't even take the symptoms.

99
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,890
Anyway is not in the Repertory falling next to the "flying dolphin" is not in the Repertory

100
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:32,590
but then what he will tell you about his job, that he has a lifetime,

101
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,800
many years of frustration, ailments from (?)

102
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,320
that is the symptom you're going to write down.

103
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:45,830
The intensity is relative to the way the patient expresses himself

104
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,410
and that is important as well.

105
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,910
-This system deals with the difference between mind symptom and body symptom.

106
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:06,140
Is that not special influence of the (?) of the symptoms?

107
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:14,250
-Yes. I would like to ask if there are questions about the underlining.

108
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:25,570
-(?) to become a symptom, how would you evaluate if there is a very rare symptom

109
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:28,570
that only appears once every two months?

110
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:32,170
-In one person?
-Yes.

111
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:43,310
It depends but I would say if it is a very seldom symptom, very clear present,

112
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:52,970
with clear I mean they suffer from it, then even if it appears once every 4 nights,

113
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:57,490
it is important I would say so.

114
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:04,060
You can have a headache which is better from drinking coffee,

115
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,310
he has the headache every two weeks only but he drinks even half a cup of coffee

116
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:14,650
and the headache in minutes disappears, so head-pain-coffee-amel,

117
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:21,660
even if it happens every 2-3 weeks it is a strong modality.

118
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:29,730
-Concerning the underlining. Does it happen that remedies are selected by underline?

119
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:33,990
For example, Mandragora is found in the rubric restlessness.

120
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:39,140
If I have a patient who is (?) very intense restlessness,

121
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:46,150
I would use the rubric as a 3rd degree but Mandragora is only in the 1st degree in this rubric.

122
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:51,140
Does this underlining give any preference to certain remedies and not to others?

123
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:59,640
-Yes. This is a very good example and I will explain you in the next step,

124
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:06,600
the reason of the underlining. And it comes down to reply to your question.

125
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:15,580
If we have a patient and we suspect, say Stramonium.

126
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:21,730
You know at a certain stage we will ask some confirmation questions to know

127
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:30,980
if it is really Stramonium. One question could be fear of dark.

128
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:40,000
So you ask what do you feel in dark? And what is the reply you expect from Stramonium?

129
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:57,910
Oh yes, in the dark I have to put the light on all the time. Very strong fear of the dark.

130
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:02,090
Now if you go in the Repertory and you see fear of dark,

131
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:07,060
you will see Stramonium is in the 4th degree. It is the strongest remedy.

132
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:13,150
So for Stramonium, it means that in the provings and the clinical cases,

133
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:17,150
it was very often present, fear of dark in Stramonium.

134
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:24,230
Now we take this one step further, if we go to the patients and we suspect Stramonium

135
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:31,430
we expect that each patient has a strong fear of dark.

136
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:34,570
This is the confirmation of Stramonium.

137
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:46,370
If the patient has some... fear of dark, this is an argument against Stramonium.

138
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:52,120
Or it is not pushing Stramonium forward to the maximum.

139
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:59,140
This is called correspondence of intensity.

140
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:06,950
So Stramonium has fear of dark in 4th degree, Stramonium patients, for the best,

141
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:13,640
has fear of dark 4th degree, corresponding of intensity.

142
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:24,450
And the rule is the better the intensity corresponds, the better case you have for the remedy.

143
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:42,950
-Just before you mentioned that the degree in the Repertory has nothing to do

144
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:48,280
with the intensity but only how often it appears in the rubric.

145
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:58,010
And now for the analysis it is very important to underline according to intensity

146
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:03,510
and it makes a difference for Stramonium, for example.

147
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:12,470
Now you refer to the intensity, as if the 4th degree for Stramonium in fear of darkness

148
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:16,720
has something to do with the intensity, where before you said

149
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:21,990
it has to do with how often it appears.

150
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:25,090
-Yes that's correct.

151
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:40,910
That's why I was trying to escape all morning from continuing in that level.

152
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:44,060
Because I know it will bring some confusion.

153
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:51,550
I will now try to clarify the confusion. First step, the Repertory was made.

154
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:55,310
Why was remedy put in 1st,2nd or 3rd degree?

155
00:17:55,410 --> 00:18:02,070
Because of frequency in proving and clinical case. Everybody agrees?

156
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:10,480
Then Repertory has been used, more information has been added and in fact a woman,

157
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:19,760
Margaret Tyler came with this idea and said, it's interesting I see

158
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:27,470
that for some of the remedies I prescribe, the symptoms which contain a remedy in bold

159
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:31,210
the patients express these symptoms in bold.

160
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:37,230
The Arsenicum fear alone or fear in dark, the Arsenicum patient has a lot fear alone

161
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,970
or fear in dark.

162
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:43,970
And so she brought up the idea that the correspondence in the degrees

163
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:49,220
was an interesting way to process the information.

164
00:18:49,320 --> 00:19:02,800
That's why I leave this on because another way to look at the symptoms of your patients

165
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:10,170
is this correspondence of degrees.

166
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:21,210
You are right, it is in a way opposed because you are using like a tool for paint

167
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:26,110
you use it to make a sculpture. It is a different application.

168
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:30,430
But it is a fact and then George has really brought it into Homeopathy

169
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:35,710
the famous underlining, he really uses it all the time, to that extend

170
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:39,780
that the VES refuses to work if the case is not underlined.

171
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:49,060
It is his way of thinking that you must know first of all from the patient,

172
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:55,870
how intense is the fear of the dark, how intense is the jealousy etc.

173
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:03,840
Then you correspond the intensity from the patient with the degree of the Repertory

174
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:08,690
and I will say "whatever has that meant in the past".

175
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:18,320
I must admit that these degrees in the Repertory is now been used for another goal.

176
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:23,980
And it is correct. But first is the history and today, since Margaret Tyler,

177
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:31,990
I think she was active in the 30's, in 40's there is this idea,

178
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:35,990
especially with George now of correspondence of degrees.

179
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:42,980
So it's just another idea with which George agrees, that correspondence of degrees,

180
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:48,990
patient and Repertory, is an interesting way of analyzing the case

181
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,590
and decide for the remedy.

182
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:59,160
But it is true that it is a little bit gone of the original intention of degrees

183
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:08,250
and it means also that we will need to reconsider the whole story of degrees in the Repertory.

184
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:15,250
And we're doing that. In the next version, you may expect some new things about it.

185
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:21,740
But for the time being it is important to understand that it is true

186
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:27,240
that if look at 10 Stramonium patients, most of them will have strong fear of dark

187
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:32,570
and it will be only 1 maybe, who has fear of dark, which is not so pronounced.

188
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:36,170
And you can repeat this for many examples.

189
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:55,100
So I explained to you the first 6 methods of repertorization, more or less classical

190
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:06,140
I told you there is correspondence of degrees, someone else gave me another idea

191
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:11,990
that there are still other ways to look at information.

192
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:21,390
So if 2-3 symptoms come from mind and they indicate to Pulsatilla,

193
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:28,300
it is maybe a different thing than 2-3 symptoms from extremities which point to Lycopodium.

194
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,060
Because it corresponds to 3 symptoms in mind, it's more argument for Pulsatilla

195
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:38,810
than 3 arguments for Lycopodium because they come from extremities.

196
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:41,590
Because we say mental symptoms are more important, if they are present

197
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,810
they are real, they are more important.

198
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:48,070
So the chapter has an influence as well.

199
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:55,470
In fact I write down 6, 7 maybe 8 rules but they are more.

200
00:22:55,570 --> 00:23:00,970
There are many ways to reflect about the homeopathic information and the symptoms.

201
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:09,310
What we did with George is made an exhaustive, complete list of all these rules

202
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:16,060
and for each rule defined the applications and the exceptions

203
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,300
and the possible relation to other rules.

204
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:26,320
So we have an enormous form with a lot of calculations and you get

205
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:30,570
what is called a probability rate as the results.

206
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:38,830
If a remedy is suggested as 1 or 2 or 3 in the Expert System, it is probability calculation.

207
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:47,330
What is the interest of this?

208
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:55,500
I have used this case in the morning to explain you a few things. You still remember it?

209
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:00,470
And I used it in every method of repertorization.

210
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:09,770
There is another way to look at this. If I click here, then I see the 6 different methods

211
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:15,620
of repertorization all together in one screen. The first remedies for each of them.

212
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:23,190
If you didn't remember, you see remedies which are the 1,2,3 and 4th possibility

213
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:26,940
for each method of repertorization.

214
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:34,440
Now if we combine all this, some al-chemistry starts to work

215
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:44,370
and all the elements are added and those who have taken a symptom they know,

216
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:49,020
if they use the VES which is just hitting another key,

217
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:57,300
that it is confirmed that Lachesis is the major possibility of this real live asthmatic case.

218
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:05,780
That Lachesis was given with some results but not with continuation of improvement.

219
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:14,860
And that the remedy which brought the cure to completion, it was Aralia.

220
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:21,790
So this is an example of how the VES ...

221
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,790
You had this case, you know it.

222
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:31,280
So you can tell me the difference between Lachesis and Aralia?

223
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:44,600
Let's make it in a different way. A person has asthma, Lachesis is the remedy.

224
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:49,620
When do you expect the asthma to aggravate? Give some ideas.

225
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:53,120
Aggravation in asthma for Lachesis?

226
00:25:54,120 --> 00:26:09,870
-After sleep, the heat.
-Before menses.

227
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,130
-And another one, general aggravation of Lachesis?

228
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:27,970
-Waking, after sleep.
-Going into sleep.

229
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:39,860
-When falling asleep. Lachesis is the remedy when it falls asleep, it wakes up again.

230
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:47,460
When is falling asleep, asthma comes up again.

231
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:53,960
So the falling asleep process is difficult in Lachesis, as with the real snakes by chance.

232
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:59,710
And what is the point here with Aralia? Now you remember?

233
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:15,220
It is not when falling asleep but...one hour after sleep, after the first sleep.

234
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:22,120
The point I want to make now is that we have the same symptoms,

235
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:26,620
as for all the other methods, they speak about Calcarea, Lachesis, Pulsatilla, Silica,

236
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,120
you've seen it all.

237
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:33,620
You use the same symptoms with a little bit of this more complicated calculation

238
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,860
and you have a nice suggestion for Aralia.

239
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:41,860
That is what the Expert System does.

240
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,460
I will explain you, as a next point, the figures.

241
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,110
Because when you use the Expert System you need to know what it means

242
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:55,960
and if it is projected you can know, if George wants to continue, yes or no.

243
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,860
So the messages I believe they are clear.

244
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,930
You can read the messages understand the messages but I want to explain he figures.

245
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:10,530
Every remedy here, which is projected as a first possibility, has a figure

246
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:19,030
which we call the absolute confidence rate you may have in that remedy.

247
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:28,710
And there is just the result of calculations and it may be a figure of 12625 or 6720

248
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:29,950
it doesn't matter.

249
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:41,620
It is recalculated in such a way that you can consider that the figure 100 is the ideal to go for.

250
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:53,440
So when you get closed and above100, it means that there are very good arguments for Lachesis.

251
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,040
That's what it means.

252
00:28:56,540 --> 00:29:03,270
So you will see in the beginning it will be 45, 60 etc. When the case goes on

253
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:12,860
and it is coherent, these figures will increase to 80 and 90000, it may become very big

254
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,610
if some confirmatory symptoms are added.

255
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:24,280
But then there is still another figure which is important, the one between brackets.

256
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,450
The relative confidence we have in the prescription.

257
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:36,120
Now what does it mean? It's a technical explanation for real life.

258
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:43,540
If you have very good arguments for Lachesis, will you prescribe Lachesis?

259
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:54,120
It depends. If these very good arguments for Lachesis are only for Lachesis.

260
00:29:54,220 --> 00:30:00,120
Or maybe because of the same symptoms, you have very good arguments for Pulsatilla

261
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:05,360
which is often close and for other remedies.

262
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:09,350
So you have very good arguments for Lachesis but still you're not confident

263
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:15,860
because the confidence in Lachesis is relative, there is good arguments for Pulsatilla,

264
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,960
for Natrum Muriaticum or whatever.

265
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:25,350
So the relative confidence in a remedy becomes close to 100 again,

266
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:31,500
if it is outstanding if the arguments differentiate it from confidence

267
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,260
or the arguments for other remedies.

268
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:40,410
And this is what you see on the screen, which George calls the columns show me the columns,

269
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:49,150
he says and where the confidence in each remedy is put in a graphical way.

270
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:55,410
This is the probability for each remedy at this step. The longer the bar,

271
00:30:55,510 --> 00:31:00,660
the more confidence, the more arguments for each of these remedies.

272
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:05,900
And you see there are two big bars, Lachesis and Aralia

273
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,240
and then Calcarea (?) is a bit less and all the rest still less.

274
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:21,310
So mainly still 4 remedies are possibility and that is why in this case the prescription says,

275
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:28,820
100 very good argument for Lachesis but 57 in the second figure,

276
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:35,810
not absolutely sure it is Lachesis because there are still possibilities for other remedies.

277
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:39,600
And you look at Calcarea (?) and Aralia.

278
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:51,660
We look which are the symptoms here, look what I will do.

279
00:31:51,760 --> 00:32:06,570
I will take another Lachesis symptom, clothing aggravates and I will add it to the

280
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:09,570
previous ones.

281
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:19,340
If I run the Expert System again you see arguments for Lachesis even better 126.

282
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:26,080
And it is a bit more outstanding, if we go to the columns, you see the Lachesis

283
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,100
and Aralia are stronger.

284
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:34,070
So the relative confidence for the prescription in Lachesis will increase.

285
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:38,190
Nevertheless still take care of these other few remedies.

286
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:51,850
Another one.

287
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:07,410
I go here desire for farinaceous food, I add it

288
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:14,410
and now I have an outstanding case of Lachesis.

289
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:21,430
253 outstanding arguments for Lachesis and confidence of 111.

290
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:28,420
Because now Aralia is still somewhere but we have no over powering arguments for Lachesis.

291
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,150
Of course this was not a real case.

292
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:38,660
I just showed you how typical symptoms can move confidence rate up for a remedy.

293
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,410
This is the way you play with these figures to understand if the consultation

294
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:49,010
has come to an end or not.

295
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,660
-One more question concerning these figures.

296
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,660
In the beginning you said the first number could only go up to 100

297
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,820
when should be close to 100 or around 100. But now it goes beyond 100.

298
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:18,160
-Yes I said should go close to 100, when it goes to 80, 90, 100

299
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:23,410
and above it means good arguments for. So for sure it can go above.

300
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:28,840
If I add all the keynotes of Lachesis, it will go to 500 and 600.

301
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:38,750
-I have the same question for the second figure.

302
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:40,490
-Same reply.

303
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:43,980
-But how much more less is very sure?

304
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:50,900
-For the absolute confidence next to the remedy 80 and above.

305
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:58,640
For the second figure I would say it starts from 60-70. But don't rely on the figures.

306
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:03,820
If you doubt between Aralia and Lachesis, just say the patient,

307
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,650
I'll call you back tomorrow, you read your little book and you find out from Materia Medica

308
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:10,890
which is the better remedy.

309
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:17,160
Don't rely on the figures, don't rely on repertorization. It is just tools that show a road.

310
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,400
-Can you say something about the numbers of rubrics which are,

311
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:46,650
(?) says that at least 4 rubrics have to be chosen

312
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:53,180
but maybe there is also a maximum where (?) becomes useless.

313
00:35:54,160 --> 00:36:01,070
-I believe there is a figure, a number of symptoms at which virtually

314
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:05,070
every repertorization becomes useless.

315
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:10,810
First of all I agree with you 4 symptoms is a minimum.

316
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:23,650
We must have some ground on which to stand and then it may be 6,7,12,15

317
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:30,070
sometimes up to 20 but most of the cases will follow in this range.

318
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:37,250
I mean single symptoms. Of course one symptom, which is 5 symptoms combined it's not 1 symptom.

319
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:40,490
This will be the range, you may expect.

320
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:43,890
If it' much above you feel you get too much symptoms, maybe it's better

321
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:48,060
to clear away a few symptoms and keep the essential ones.

322
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:05,250
Then I would like to speak a little bit about the future.

323
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:13,410
-One little thing. The use of the VES is very important,

324
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:21,650
as you said already in 91 to start right away, first to use it with the patient,

325
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:22,900
not when he is gone.

326
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,820
It is much better to use it when he is here and second to make evaluation

327
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,810
every time you have added one symptom.

328
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:39,320
So you get continuous development of the possibilities

329
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:44,920
and probabilities for the prescription.

330
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:52,310
It's very helpful, we should use it this way.

331
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:57,690
-Yes absolutely. Perfect.
