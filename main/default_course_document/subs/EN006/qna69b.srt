1
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:25,930
-I have been wondering for a long time what is Hahnemann mean with the low potencies

2
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,930
and the high potencies?

3
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:42,220
-Hahnemann used potencies like 3X, 4X, 6X and at the end of his life reached up to 60.

4
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,370
This was the highest.

5
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:50,930
Hahnemann was dealing primarily with low potencies and what he wrote mostly referred

6
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,290
to low potencies.

7
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:02,360
That is why we have said that when Hahnemann talks about aggravations,

8
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:16,290
he means aggravations because of too much substance given, poisoning the person.

9
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:28,610
Belladonna 3X, three times the day, for so many grams, then he would observe aggravations.

10
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:36,430
This is different than what we have today where we took the potencies much further

11
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:42,530
and we are dealing with entirely different rates of potencies.

12
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,580
-He was working with mother tinctures and then finally he diluted the mother tinctures

13
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:58,010
and potentised them and this set from the mother tinctures to the potentization,

14
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:05,750
where do I find this?
-The idea is new.

15
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:14,500
When Hahnemann thought of succussing or triturating, this was a new idea,

16
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,490
as far as I understand, coming from Hahnemann directly.

17
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:27,780
There are some people who say that Paracelsus was influencing quite a lot

18
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:34,010
and Hahnemann was knowing the teaching of Paracelsus.

19
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:44,500
In Paracelsus there are very specific references to the Similia Similibus Curentur.

20
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:53,330
That is true. Also there is reference to another way of preparing medicine

21
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,840
it was up to that time.

22
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:01,510
Paracelsus went further with some ideas which I have not studied Paracelsus

23
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,310
and I can not tell you exactly.

24
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:10,080
What I know is that he was preparing medicines with very strange procedures.

25
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:15,170
Now Hahnemann having read Paracelsus, having read Hippocrates

26
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:24,830
because Hippocrates also was there and having read this army doctor Staul or what is his name,

27
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:39,000
who specifically to this law of similars, he got the idea finally and then

28
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:46,080
as he was prescribing mother tinctures he saw of course aggravations,

29
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,570
what he calls aggravations in his Materia Medica.

30
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:52,240
And then what he got the idea to dilute and then not only to dilute

31
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,610
but to succuss or to triturate.

32
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:12,820
This does not minimize the importance of Hahnemann discovery.

33
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:21,990
Because neither Hippocrates, nor Staul nor Paracelsus made a system out of these ideas

34
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:27,740
and we would have been lost totally today, if it was not for Hahnemann today.

35
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:34,240
Therefore the contribution of Hahnemann to humanity which has not been yet acknowledged...

36
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:42,320
It's going to be acknowledged in the future and most probably he will be the man

37
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:46,910
who really benefited humanity.

38
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:56,310
You get Nobel prizes, you get Einstein, you get all these things.

39
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:06,330
All these people who did discoveries, they contributed in destroying the planet.

40
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:12,740
All the medicines which have been discovered, penicillin has been discovered

41
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:21,820
and Fleming became a very great man but what we see today is that penicillin in fungus

42
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:27,820
is circulating the human race. You will see the same thing.

43
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:33,810
Einstein said, if you explode this, then they exploded and then you see what happened.

44
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:43,390
And now we adore these people who actually we consider they have contributed

45
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:49,710
to the evolution of human race but how much they have contributed to the destruction

46
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,480
of the human race.

47
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:56,140
Where Hahnemann is the only one who has contributed only to the evolution

48
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,410
and to the regeneration of the human race.

49
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:06,650
Now we are only a few thousands or a few millions who know that

50
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:13,650
but I believe in 20 years most of the planet will know about the contribution of Hahnemann

51
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,710
and then they will realize.

52
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:28,280
And that's why in Washington, in a big square there is his statue

53
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:35,730
and this year it's very interesting that the American Institute of Homeopathy,

54
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:44,750
which is the oldest Medical Association of America, they are paying tribute to this statue

55
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:50,750
and to the memory of Hahnemann. So it starts already.

56
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:04,300
-This time I speak in German. I'd like to suggest that when he speaks about the smallest amount,

57
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,300
when he speaks about the Q potencies because in the end of the Organon,

58
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,740
he introduces the Q potencies...

59
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:20,390
-In the last edition. If this was written before, that doesn't mean about Q potency

60
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:26,890
because Q potencies were introduced in the last 6th edition and this what you are reading

61
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:30,740
it was there on the 5th edition.

62
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:45,570
-So you mean that he only added the paragraph 270 to the Organon.

63
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:52,100
I never read the Organon edition number 5, I never read it so far. I just had the 6th edition.

64
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:58,890
So you mean he just added that. In the rest of Organon, he still means the potency

65
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:22,010
that you were talking of?
-I was talking about 270.

66
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:28,190
-If we give too strong a dose of a medicine which may have been even

67
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:36,690
quite homeopathically chosen for the morbid state before us, it must not withstand the inherent

68
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:43,690
and beneficial character of its nature, prove injurious but its mere magnitude.

69
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:47,040
This means low potency.

70
00:08:51,540 --> 00:09:04,940
Also in the proving, a paragraph in which he says all herbs, all substances,

71
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:12,690
they will have an influence upon the human organism, all, as long as they are given

72
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:16,630
in large enough doses.

73
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:21,870
Large enough it doesn't mean high potency. It means low potency.

74
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:33,360
Large enough means you don't kill the person but you go to the sub-toxic state of the case.

75
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:38,210
And that is how you do real provings.

76
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,040
-I would like to convecture the case of Hyoscyamus.

77
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,800
These cases that we need in our office, in our practices.

78
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:55,860
You said that the real changes, like the change of temperature, would only appear about

79
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:00,110
after five months of taking the remedy.

80
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:06,120
-No. You are not right.

81
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:14,610
The patient will say, I felt the change five months later but the real change has started

82
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:17,860
immediately after taking the remedy.

83
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:22,350
The real change is immediately after taking the remedy.

84
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:28,320
Now the organism does not feel it, yes but the real change has started.

85
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,850
So where are the changes as far as the patient is concerned?

86
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:40,360
When he will realize of the different changes but is he attentive enough to know

87
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:47,140
or to realize that now I can walk on the snow where before I could not walk?

88
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,350
He says something happened, I don't know what it is.

89
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,610
What he is interested is the panic attacks.

90
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:59,620
When the panic attacks are gone, then he says my god.

91
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,030
This is six months later but this does not mean anything.

92
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:08,310
The change has started the next moment that you put the medicine.

93
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:12,770
-Nevertheless I would like to point a question. We have such difficult cases

94
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:19,220
where the problem is going about 20 years in which case we should inform the patient

95
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:26,540
to come back only after 8 weeks or 12 weeks? What is the best to do with such cases?

96
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:35,140
-It depends. There are cases which you may have to see quite soon.

97
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:41,300
And there are cases where you may have to see after two months.

98
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:46,190
So there is no standard, one standard.

99
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:56,430
More or less what we have done in Athens, in the Center, I established a time,

100
00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:03,430
which is one month, the minimum time to evaluate a treatment.

101
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:08,010
And I found out that in most of the cases I was able to evaluate.

102
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:14,090
Now some of the cases I was not able to evaluate and it took two months or three months

103
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:20,090
before we evaluate and in some of the cases we made a mistake and changing the remedy

104
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:23,600
because we believed the patient.

105
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:31,010
Many times I have told you tricks where you can trick the patient to tell you the truth.

106
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:37,940
Because the patient when he comes with a panic attack, he means that my panic attack

107
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,510
will go away. He doesn't need anything else.

108
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:44,010
Whether his feet are cold or hot, he doesn't care.

109
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:49,880
So therefore when he comes and tells you I'm the same, he will come after a month

110
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,600
and say, I'm the same.

111
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:59,010
Then you have written down all the other symptoms and you go one by one and you ask him.

112
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:07,790
And you see spicy food and you see hesitation.

113
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:14,180
You used to like spicy food. Yes, I still like.

114
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:21,520
There immediately this should make you suspicious. How this has changed?

115
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:37,320
And then you can find little fine symptoms that will point out to you there is most probably

116
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,080
and action and you have to wait.

117
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:47,690
Especially little things.

118
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:53,330
It comes someone who has a tremendous eczema and the eczema is oozing

119
00:13:53,430 --> 00:14:01,740
and you are asking, no I'm the same and he looks the same and maybe he is a little bit worse

120
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,080
but he doesn't say it.

121
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:12,300
But in the meantime you ask you were quite irritable. Yes, I'm still irritable.

122
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:21,230
And then you perceive in the eyes that he is searching, am I still irritable?

123
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:30,900
Then you must jump and say, I see your eyes you doubt? Well, maybe I'm a little bit less.

124
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:41,010
Then immediately you start thinking my remedy has started working already.

125
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:57,000
Unfortunately Homeopathy is also an art of observation but real acute observation,

126
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,580
not imagination observation.

127
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:10,250
Because you can stretch something out, you can project into the patient things.

128
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:16,810
You have to be sure that this is happening. Not, I think he is hesitating.

129
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:22,270
You have to confirm that he is hesitating because he will say,

130
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:30,970
oh yes now you are telling me I had a case where I should have been exploded

131
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,250
and I did not explode.

132
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:39,330
That is enough for you to wait for this eczema, 3-4 months before it goes away.

133
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,250
The remedy acts immediately.

134
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:51,630
And also depending on the person.

135
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:59,140
I told you many times I had somebody came from the CIA and he said, I'm the same.

136
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,910
I have the same panic attacks.

137
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:12,520
And it was something very light and I said, wait second month. I'm the same.

138
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:18,820
Panic attacks? Yes.

139
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:29,740
A CIA man you know what it is? Somebody who says, this is a chair, it can not be anything else.

140
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:36,140
He has to touch, to see, to be sure, they have been trained like this to suspect anything,

141
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,640
everybody. He is a magician, who is this? He is telling me, I'm better?

142
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,430
I'm not better, I'm the same.

143
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:49,390
It depends whom you have in front of you and on the other hand you may have somebody

144
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:55,640
who wants to please you and he will say, I'm better and he is nothing.

145
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:00,570
The remedy is wrong. You have to judge all these things.

146
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,790
A mother who is very anxious, what she will tell you?

147
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,520
She will tell you ever that the child is better? No.

148
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:13,470
She wants the child to be better and better and better. She will never admit it is better,

149
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:18,060
especially when we are dealing with psychological problems.

150
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:25,050
The mother always is very anxious, my child is it going crazy? Yes or no?

151
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:31,290
So she will not give you objective but you cannot say, you are a bad mother

152
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:39,700
or you do not know what you are doing. You have to judge yourself, the anxiety of the mother

153
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:44,430
and how much she gives you information. And base the description on details.

154
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,520
Is he going to school? Oh yes, he went to school.

155
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:53,770
But you told me he was not going to school in the morning, now he goes in the morning.

156
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:56,860
That is enough for you to wait.

157
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,520
-A patient had a lot of hematomas and swelling on the face

158
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:09,210
and I was very insecure to give Arnica or Hypericum, the more important remedy

159
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:14,630
and I tried to find out from the patient which is more painful and he said, I don't know.

160
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:18,870
I looked up in the first aid book for homeopathic remedies

161
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:23,960
and they said give the remedies alternatively and I wanted to know was that OK,

162
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,310
is that correct or not?

163
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:34,730
-In emergency cases you can do whatever you like.

164
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:44,960
Especially when you have somebody there and he is lying down with a brain stroke

165
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:50,160
or a heart stroke, you have to act very fast.

166
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:54,790
So nobody will accuse, if you bring back this case, that you gave three remedies.

167
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:58,790
I gave three remedies because I had no symptoms and I thought 3 remedies

168
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:01,540
and I gave 3 of them alternating.

169
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:07,220
Now in your case I don't know how severe it was the case because I have been

170
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:12,130
in the same case exactly. Rather worse.

171
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:20,620
Because my wisdom tooth had stuck on the lower jaw and when it was extracted

172
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:33,370
by a severe operation, the dentist who was holding the tube to suck the blood,

173
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:36,380
she fainted twice.

174
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:47,380
The dentist who was not a young dentist because he was quite aggressive, an army doctor,

175
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:55,120
cutting bones, cutting this and that.

176
00:19:55,220 --> 00:20:04,660
Then just to give you an example he said, be careful this is the nerve, don't suck it.

177
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:12,620
The nerve had been uncovered, it was passing from the trigeminal gland,

178
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,870
it was uncovered and was full of blood and she was sucking and said,

179
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:20,470
be careful this is the nerve, don't suck the nerve.

180
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:27,280
And she fainted and I was sitting, totally exhausted for 1 1/2 hour.

181
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:36,950
When I came out, I was bruised up to here and on Monday I had to give a seminar.

182
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:46,450
And it was Friday and I said, I'm so stupid, why I did that on Friday?

183
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:51,710
I could never imagine that this was a major operation and I was in that same situation,

184
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:56,200
I took one remedy after another, it doesn't matter.

185
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:03,200
On Monday I had to be back, so I could speak or I could survive.

186
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:08,950
So I took Arnica definitely because it was black all this.

187
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:22,870
It was black and my neck was swollen and it was Bryonia, Arnica, Hypericum, Calcarea phosphorica

188
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:34,540
and Magnesia phosphorica and Hevla lava and what else? Whatever.

189
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:43,220
On Monday nobody believed this that I had all that. Still is on video.

190
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:50,040
I said OK, it's an emergency case. Shall I wait for the action?

191
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:56,050
No, you don't wait, especially this type of operation.

192
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:58,210
But I will tell you something.

193
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:17,380
If the bone is cut and infected, which will give you pains like lightening

194
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:28,340
because of the bone of the jaw, then one of the best remedies is Hecla lava.

195
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:39,060
But if you give Hecla lava in the beginning, it will not do anything.

196
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:45,010
You have to have the Arnica, repeated Arnica.

197
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,620
Next.

198
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:03,650
-Two short questions. One is about Berberis. We weren't quite sure.

199
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,650
We wanted to confirm one symptom of Berberis.

200
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:13,820
Is it true, you said they can' support feeling lonesome. Is that true?

201
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:24,370
-It is true but it's not a keynote. In the examinations I will not give you this.

202
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:29,420
-The other question is when Hahnemann writes about narcotics

203
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,420
which make a stronger second reaction, than other remedies,

204
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:42,140
didn't just mean Opium of Nux moschata or what kind?

205
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:54,170
-By this time I believe he means all the derivatives of opium, hashish, cannabis, morphine.

206
00:23:54,270 --> 00:24:01,770
-Thank you.
-Next.

207
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:10,340
If you have a very old patient and you treat him and give a high potency,

208
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:21,260
most probably if your remedy is correct and he does not have the possibility to cure,

209
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:27,300
he does not have the possibility to make an aggravation, then most probably

210
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:36,110
what will happen is that the remedy will suppress the situation.

211
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:59,250
I believe that if we had the possibility to do a double-blind studies

212
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:05,080
where people who need a transplant, half of them would go to Homeopathy

213
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:08,250
and half of them would go for heart transplant.

214
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:19,370
And find out the time and the quality of life after the two treatments I think,

215
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:26,360
I cannot prove it now, but I think with good Homeopathy, homeopathic treatment

216
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:31,390
in severe heart cases will be much better than heart transplant.

217
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:38,940
The life expectancy will increase and the quality of life will be better.

218
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:47,880
-The size of the dose is depending on the action of the size of the dose is connected

219
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,620
with the Avogadro number.

220
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:58,130
Meaning everything about 23X it does not matter how large or small the dose is you give,

221
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:05,310
whereas everything below D23 does have an effect on how large or how small the dose is?

222
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:14,810
-I would even go lower. More or less this is correct but D23,

223
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:34,100
which is if I'm not mistaken D18 is the Avogadro number. D23? OK.

224
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:44,180
In this case we suppose to have one molecule. It doesn't matter.

225
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:53,190
So therefore when you come even lower, you will have very few molecules left,

226
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:57,680
in which case they cannot really poison the patient.

227
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:10,450
So even the 12D, I would say, it would be the time where it doesn't matter the amount.

228
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:17,960
If now you give of course this kind of potency, the amount here is very important.

229
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:21,690
Here you have to be careful not to give too much.

230
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:32,280
-In 221 or 223 of the Organon, Hahnemann talks about treatment of acute mental cases

231
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:36,040
or acute mental disorders.

232
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:43,790
The question is, is it also your observation that if you treat an acute case

233
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:52,510
of a psychological disorder, that it is always necessary to follow this with a second treatment?

234
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:58,340
Hahnemann calls it antipsoric treatment but of course we know this not only as psoric

235
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:06,340
but is it also your observation that in all cases a second following treatment is needed

236
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,840
to prevent a relapse and then it acts better?

237
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:17,420
Hahnemann clearly states if you do not let the second treatment follow

238
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:24,250
the first acute treatment, then already a very minor cause can lead to relapse,

239
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:29,100
which then it might be much worse than the first acute that you treated?

240
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:39,430
-My experience and what really happens is that during an acute psychotic episode,

241
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:46,250
you may need 1, 2 or 3 remedies before you can get over it.

242
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:54,430
After this when the patient comes back to his senses, you need to take the case

243
00:28:54,530 --> 00:29:02,240
and to see if you can find the remedy underline or whatever happens after the acute episode.

244
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:08,280
Then it is much better, if you find the remedy, then either the episode will take place

245
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:16,500
much later after 3-5 years or it will not repeat itself.

246
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:25,950
But if you just treat the acute insanity, during which maybe you are prescribing

247
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:30,590
also the underlined constitutional remedy there might be.

248
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:38,080
So the case I related to you from the previous seminar, it was a case of Mercury.

249
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:42,160
You said syphilis is there because of the Mercury.

250
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:57,010
Then she goes into that state in which she brings out a picture of Platina.

251
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:05,660
Acute insanity, Platina. You will see the sexual element is very exaggerated,

252
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:18,850
it's not under control and I have to describe to you a little bit but it is rather embarrassing.

253
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:38,560
You can imagine the Platina being not controlled. The sexual element is loose

254
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:47,820
and therefore cannot control and I could see for instance in this woman...

255
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:59,540
she would do movements, which are sexual movements, that's one.

256
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:15,830
As if she was having a sexual intercourse and then everything was happening

257
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:21,420
around the area of the genitalia. That was not all.

258
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:33,530
There were men who were holding her and at a certain moment she would grab the man

259
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:43,230
or she would do... I don't want to go into detail because the main idea is ...

260
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:57,330
When I arrived I had Platina and two people were holding her and I said, let her.

261
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:06,310
She immediately brought down my zip and tried to grab me and the men hold her again

262
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:22,590
and I put this Platina and the people who were holding felt immediately the loosing up.

263
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:37,600
One of these people because they were holding in shifts.

264
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:45,720
One woman was holding and a man on the other side and she said to me,

265
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:48,500
you are not the only one.

266
00:32:53,330 --> 00:33:06,080
But it was amazing, she said, I'm amazed I've never seen such immediate reaction to the case.

267
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:09,730
She went back to England and she was normal.

268
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:19,480
This Platina was really her underline state? Maybe, which I did not see.

269
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:24,480
When I took the case here I saw the Mercury and then the Platina.

270
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:30,400
Both are syphilitic remedies, if you can say that.

271
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:38,250
But maybe later on a Calcarea carbonica, a Sulphur, whatever remedy is indicated.

272
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:46,250
But during the acute state you may need 2, 3 remedies before you can control the acute insanity.

273
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:52,150
And it's not an easy thing I can tell you.

274
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:58,900
You have to be observant, you have to evaluate correctly the symptoms, the signs,

275
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:06,190
depending on the education of the person.

276
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:11,700
What kind of education she received from home, how much she was controlled etc.

277
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:22,910
And you have to evaluate the sense because we don't have a sedative.

278
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:27,150
Just to give a sedative and forget about the details.

279
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:35,260
Platina 10M.

280
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:48,210
-One of the main problems in our clinics are problems of the metabolism of the fat.

281
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:54,460
50 to 60% of all the population of the western world have problems with their cholesterol

282
00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:00,200
and if you look where this originates, the problem of the metabolism of the cholesterol,

283
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:07,850
then you either have missing or defected enzymes or missing or defected receptors.

284
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:13,800
Which means that actually homeopathically you can do nothing because missing organs

285
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,040
you cannot replace with Homeopathy.

286
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:22,050
In our practice even though patients are treated very well, I see only marginal

287
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:26,280
or no change at all concerning the cholesterol levels.

288
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:30,080
Of course your attention is there and you have to pay attention to this

289
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:34,540
and if you read that if you give medication to lower the cholesterol level,

290
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:41,540
this prolongs the life expectancy and here I come to a conflict.

291
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:46,530
If I treat them chemically, I can't treat them homeopathically.

292
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:50,790
If I treat them homeopathically, that means that I ignore the risk of them

293
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:53,540
developing arteriosclerosis.

294
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:59,040
Now I think that with Homeopathy, I come to the conclusion that maybe

295
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:02,800
the positive effect of the homeopathic treatment would be that the patient

296
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:07,810
do not develop the arteriosclerosis, meaning they will not have any deposit

297
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:10,630
or residue in the arteries.

298
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:14,300
But it's no problem with the patient who comes to me and say what I do

299
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,870
with the high cholesterol and tell them there is no problem but when they get a brain stroke

300
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:24,950
or heart attack. So what would be the possible action of Homeopathy even though

301
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:31,090
the blood produces cholesterol to prevent the patient from having arteriosclerosis?

302
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:38,690
-The question of cholesterol is not a simple one.

303
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:45,530
It is for many reasons why cholesterol will raise.

304
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:54,570
It has been found out through research that, for instance, if you get angry the cholesterol

305
00:36:54,670 --> 00:37:03,490
will rise, if you get anxious the cholesterol will arise, if you eat badly the cholesterol

306
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:10,770
will rise, if you are missing some enzyme the cholesterol will rise.

307
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:17,250
What you are doing or how you are treating with such cases where you have high cholesterol?

308
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:25,160
First of all you try to find out the correct remedy,
if you want to treat them homeopathically.

309
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:32,570
You give the correct remedy and the correct remedy does everything else

310
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:38,790
except of lowering the cholesterol.

311
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:43,290
In such a case most probably the person is doing something or is under

312
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:49,390
such a certain stress which you cannot handle.

313
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:52,370
In such a case you will take other measures as well.

314
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:57,120
That means your remedy has not been able to lower the cholesterol, why?

315
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:03,780
Because the person continues to eat very badly or because the person is under such a stress

316
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,940
that cholesterol is produced all the time, in spite of the fact that you gave the remedy

317
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:12,450
and in general your patient is doing better.

318
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:18,610
So in case he is eating badly, you have to investigate and change the diet.

319
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:26,450
In case there is a tremendous stress in the life of that person, you will say take it easy.

320
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:31,880
After all you discuss this matter.

321
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:39,370
But cholesterol is only one point in the million points,

322
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:43,610
which are affected through different factors.

323
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:50,590
So homeopathic remedy will do what it can do and then you have to take measures,

324
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:58,280
which are auxiliary, which are assistant, assisting your remedy.

325
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:20,840
My experience is that cholesterol may rise even when you put a patient on a strict diet.

326
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:29,770
You put him on a strict diet and instead of seeing cholesterol going down, it goes up.

327
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:38,700
Ask this patient to take 2-3 eggs every day and the cholesterol you will see it goes down.

328
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:44,360
We do not understand all the mechanisms.

329
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:49,030
The general question whether you should bring down the cholesterol,

330
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:54,550
there is no question about that. If you have means to do it, you can do it.

331
00:39:55,290 --> 00:40:01,130
There are chemical drugs, which suppose to lower the cholesterol.

332
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:09,770
I'm not sure if in all cases will have an effect but if you find a case in which such a drug

333
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:15,520
has really good effect, you can even prescribe this drug.

334
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:22,680
But if you try this drug and you see very little is happening, then you have to find out

335
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:28,130
and correct other things which are happening with the case.

336
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,870
We continue later on.

337
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:44,790
-George I want to make a remark concerning this fat metabolism.

338
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:51,620
I also saw that cholesterol you cannot change it very much

339
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:57,350
but it doesn't concern the metabolism of triglycerides.

340
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:03,340
Triglycerides you can influence very good with Homeopathy.

341
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:11,070
I have a patient who had 3800 triglycerides, where the normal is 170

342
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:20,260
and when you put his blood on the table it was white like on a soup and he is a politician

343
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:23,090
and he has always to drink.

344
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:27,100
He is drinking vodka and I told him to stop drinking vodka

345
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,100
and triglycerides went down right away.

346
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:36,720
Then he said he cannot stop drinking, he has to drink when there are official things.

347
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:45,090
Now he is drinking and with Sulphur, which is his remedy, the triglycerides are 300.

348
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:48,250
So I think you can influence the triglycerides.

349
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:53,110
-Yes you can influence but not in all cases.

350
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:02,210
You remember a case you brought in Celle, a liver cirrhosis?

351
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:07,420
-Yes, I never heard anything from him. I thought of him and I wanted to check

352
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:12,950
if he is still living but I lost track of him.

353
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:20,680
I have another question George. I have a patient with Parkinson and he is doing very well

354
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:31,420
on Causticum but there is one symptom, it's a symptom which goes with Parkinson.

355
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,930
It's typical for Parkinson.

356
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:38,180
They want to start walking and the impulse from the brain does not go to the leg.

357
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:44,350
He has to wait until 1-2 sec until he can start. That's the only symptom that has left.

358
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:47,350
-Cocculus.

359
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,520
-And do you remember the child which I asked you?

360
00:42:53,620 --> 00:43:04,340
With convulsions, you take blood of him and he only cries 30 sec later.

361
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:10,850
He doesn't feel the pain right away and you said Cocculus and it's almost healthy now,

362
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:17,870
no more convulsions with Cocculus. Thank you.

363
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:31,510
-In which patients do you prescribe small remedies?

364
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:43,020
Are they any rules indicated [...] especially looking at this week where we have been dealing

365
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:53,250
with cases where [...] an exotic remedy.

366
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:56,600
-I've never given an exotic remedy in my life.

367
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:10,130
Small remedies sometimes you will need it once in your life time

368
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:19,050
but then what you have to have is enough information about these small remedies.

369
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:22,160
We don't have enough information.

370
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:35,300
A good thing if people would wanted to do serious work, would be to reprove small remedies

371
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:46,140
instead of giving us all this lunatic symptomatology.

372
00:44:53,890 --> 00:45:00,050
When I was practicing Homeopathy, what I mean you have to understand.

373
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:08,210
I started 8 o'clock in the morning, I was not alone, I had 1,2,3 doctors, then 5,6,7,8

374
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:11,980
and I would go around and prescribe.

375
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:21,130
The rate of success was really fantastic.

376
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:27,130
That means when Bill Gray came on 76, he said I want to stay one month to observe

377
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:35,050
what's happening. He sat next to me all the time.

378
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:41,300
I asked every patient who comes back to speak in English first.

379
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,960
How do you feel? Can you speak in English?

380
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:55,380
The patient would say very well, very well, very well and Bill would hear very well.

381
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:05,960
He says your practice is boring George and then of course he decided 2 years later

382
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:11,490
to close his office and come and stay 2 years and learn Homeopathy.

383
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:16,030
Because he said I have never had this experience.

384
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:23,460
Of course by this time treating Greek people who had not been yet degenerated

385
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:31,730
to the point that American people were degenerated already by excessive drugs,

386
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:36,300
the cases were much more easy and much less complicated.

387
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:41,710
You cannot imagine what a difference it is between somebody

388
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:47,040
who has not taken chemical drugs and a lot of injections and vaccinations

389
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:51,140
with somebody who has taken a lot of drugs, a lot of vaccinations.

390
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:55,040
You cannot imagine the difference, the cases become clear.

391
00:46:55,140 --> 00:47:01,050
During this time when I was prescribing for thousands and thousands of cases,

392
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:14,070
I calculated I prescribed for 150.000 cases, I never needed an exotic remedy.

393
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:25,290
So learn first this, treat 99% of your patients and then the 1% once you have learned all that,

394
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:28,530
you go and learn the exotic remedies.

395
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:35,030
But don't be fools and believe that by wasting your time,

396
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:40,790
studying the imagination of somebody who wanted just to write symptoms,

397
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:43,380
you are learning something in Homeopathy.

398
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:48,880
You are not learning, you are just wasting your time.

399
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:52,890
This discussion should go to the internet.

400
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:17,450
-In Kiev there was an alarm due to radioactive pollution of the air

401
00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:23,210
which resulted in the nuclear catastrophe that happened in Chernobyl.

402
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:32,710
There were huge forests fires North of Chernobyl which to Chernobyl

403
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:36,790
which led all the radioactive material and dumped it over

404
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:43,880
Kiev. Is there any possibility to protect oneself?

405
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:57,570
-No, there is no way. Not homeopathically.

406
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:08,360
You take a nylon, you put it, you close it and stay there for a 3 days

407
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:17,290
and instead of dying from radioactivity, you die from loss of oxygen.

408
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:27,860
-I remember something you have mentioned concerning healthy food.

409
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:36,700
In some magazines I have read that soya beans are now being planted in huge fields,

410
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:43,690
very large areas and that for harvest helicopters are flying over these fields

411
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:50,270
and let down some agents which are similar to the agent [name]

412
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:55,280
which were used in the Vietnam war, which takes off all the leaves of the trees.

413
00:49:55,380 --> 00:50:00,560
But the huge machines which they need for harvesting the soya fields can more easily

414
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:04,540
go through the fields but for people who try to change their diet

415
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:18,160
because they think it's healthier, they are influenced by this poison.

416
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:26,970
-It is true that this is a result of globalization.

417
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:31,370
Globalization as an idea is not a bad idea.

418
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:39,110
If the rich and those who have, they care about those who do not have

419
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:45,370
and they are poor but globalization has degenerated into rich becoming more rich

420
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:47,800
and the poor becoming more poor.

421
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:55,860
In order to become the rich more rich, he has fantastic fields of soya beans

422
00:50:55,960 --> 00:51:03,230
and he finds it easy to spray with the helicopter to make the corn easy.

423
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:09,350
Unless we understand as human beings what we are doing to the planet,

424
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:12,710
to other human being, forget it.

425
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:24,440
The drive for profit is so great that it will be inconsiderable of anything terrible

426
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:29,440
that happens in the planet and we have to understand this first.

427
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:37,110
That primarily what is important is to have a quality of life

428
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:51,710
and the quality of life is not only to have a lot to eat but to have less and more quality.

429
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:06,610
-One of my problems is I don't know when I should take Hahnemann literally

430
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:15,860
'word by word' and where not. I have been confused.

431
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:29,040
-What paragraph are you talking about?
-For example chapter 157, paragraph 157.

432
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,370
-What is your problem?

433
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:46,330
The other symptoms of the homeopathic remedy, which are often very numerous

434
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:50,280
being in no way applicable to the case of disease in question

435
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:53,120
are not called into play at all.

436
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:55,370
Is this what she is asking?

437
00:52:55,470 --> 00:53:06,720
-She says Hahnemann says do not take these symptoms into account...

438
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:17,350
-No, I will explain what it says. I understand the question. The question is wrong.

439
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:23,880
She has not understood what Hahnemann says. When I explain, she will get an answer.

440
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:35,040
Hahnemann says here that you give a remedy which has Sulphur, 2586 symptoms in

441
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:36,820
the proving.

442
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:42,470
You give it to a case and he explains that if you give it to this case,

443
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:54,330
out of 2586 symptoms of Sulphur, only 10 which are in the patient will be active.

444
00:53:54,430 --> 00:54:04,350
All the others will not be imprinted upon the case. This is what he says.

445
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:32,470
-Would you allow reflexology in her case or only Homeopathy?

446
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:34,570
-Yes, no problem.

447
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:49,870
-I have a question to the Organon again.
-Which paragraph?

448
00:54:49,970 --> 00:55:03,800
-Paragraph 161. I wonder is the initial aggravation depending on potency or not?

449
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:10,900
As far as I understood the paragraph, Hahnemann says it is depended on the potency.

450
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:22,140
-To explain what he says or you have a specific?

451
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:30,130
-As far as I understand Hahnemann says that aggravation is depending on the potency.

452
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:36,840
If you give high potency enough, there is no aggravation. If you give it too low,

453
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:39,210
there is aggravation.

454
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:42,300
-In order to understand this paragraph, you have to understand the idea of Hahnemann

455
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,550
concerning the proving.

456
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:48,460
He says if you give this kind of potencies in a proving,

457
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:54,870
because this is what he was giving more or less, then we have two actions.

458
00:55:54,970 --> 00:55:57,330
One primary action and one secondary action.

459
00:55:57,430 --> 00:56:05,080
The primary action is what this poison for the organism is doing.

460
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:12,190
The secondary action is when the organism tries to get rid of the poison.

461
00:56:12,290 --> 00:56:16,690
So there are two phases, one primary action where the effect of the poison

462
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:25,110
and the secondary action which is when the organism tries to correct itself.

463
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:33,870
In this case, in the paragraph 161 he says that if you give low potency,

464
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:39,450
especially in acute diseases, you will have the primary action.

465
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:44,620
That means you will have the primary aggravation of these remedies.

466
00:56:44,720 --> 00:57:02,710
But now he says with chronic cases I found out that if you give a 'proper' potency,

467
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:07,940
he calls it 'proper' and this proper potency is given every day and it is given every day

468
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:15,350
in a higher potency, then you will not see the aggravation.

469
00:57:15,450 --> 00:57:23,190
So he talks about the quintecimal  potencies here and the and the dilution.

470
00:57:23,290 --> 00:57:29,300
And he says I found the way not to have the aggravations.

471
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:36,870
That is by the time of Hahnemann and by his observation it was somewhat correct.

472
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:42,440
I believe he has found some cases in which still he would get aggravations from this

473
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:44,950
but he was experimenting.

474
00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:48,460
Hahnemann was experimenting all the time, till the end of his life.

475
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:58,940
Therefore today that we have a different type of diseases to treat,

476
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:02,700
which they have gone very much deeper,

477
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:14,110
to deal with such diseases with the quintecimal potencies without an aggravation

478
00:58:14,210 --> 00:58:18,530
will be almost impossible.

479
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:31,930
That is why, let us say 50 years later, when Kent came into the picture,

480
00:58:32,030 --> 00:58:41,030
50 years after Hahnemann, he spoke about the aggravation from high potencies already.

481
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:52,110
That means Hahnemann was treating different type of diseases with low potencies still

482
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:56,060
and mild potencies.

483
00:58:56,820 --> 00:59:01,940
Today in order to handle cases of this type, that we have today,

484
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:07,790
we have to go high potencies and we cannot avoid the aggravation.

485
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:26,590
It is very interesting that when we did a research in our practice with two of my students

486
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:33,600
we found out from our cases that about 82% of the cases were prescribed,

487
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:35,120
there was an initial aggravation.

488
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:52,110
We presented this research to the Congress in 1970's and there came Prof.Ortega

489
00:59:52,210 --> 01:00:11,390
from Mexico, who either because he wanted just to be opposing, controversial,

490
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:17,730
he got up and said I have never seen an aggravation.

491
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:30,800
He was supposed to be a follower of Kent, he was a Unicist and suddenly he said

492
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:34,230
I have never seen an aggravation.

493
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:43,890
Then there was some articles written in the Journal of the American Institute of

494
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:52,630
Homeopathy by that time and of course I didn't want to be nasty but what I said

495
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:56,490
if you ever seen an aggravation, have you ever seen a cure?

496
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:07,040
And you can practice Homeopathy without an aggravation but have you ever seen

497
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:10,970
a cure? That is another question.

498
01:01:11,970 --> 01:01:20,350
So there was this idea that from time to time somebody gets up

499
01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:26,790
and makes an over statement 'I've never seen an aggravation'. So what can you say?

500
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:30,560
Are you practicing Homeopathy or something else?

501
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:37,900
-It's a family, he is living in Germany and he is 44 years old

502
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:45,770
and every day he has great difficulty of having stool.

503
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:50,770
He needs 3-4 hours the day to pass stool.

504
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:51,850
-Because of pain?

505
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:58,210
-Because of an bothering urge here in the abdomen.

506
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:04,850
The urgency of stool is not felt in the rectum, it is felt here in the abdomen.

507
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:13,200
He has to sit, the stool is not dry, it is soft.

508
01:02:15,450 --> 01:02:19,100
-He has to sit 3 hours to bring down the spasm?
-Yes.

509
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:28,930
Because he has a constriction feeling in the rectum and this urgency is too much bothering.

510
01:02:29,030 --> 01:02:35,450
So he has to sit there and to hit himself to get out the stool.

511
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:37,780
-I understand.

512
01:02:38,530 --> 01:02:45,090
-Another very interesting thing is if he drinks, he makes like this.

513
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:49,450
I have to demonstrate because it is unbelievable.

514
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:00,970
It comes up the gas or I don't know what.

515
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:09,340
But it is really torturing him every day and he cannot...

516
01:03:11,110 --> 01:03:15,530
-Tell him what he can do for Homeopathy if we cure him?

517
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:26,980
-He does not have big connections.

518
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:31,600
-He is a poor man? OK we cure him for nothing.

519
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:38,760
-I tried Nux vomica and initially...

520
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:41,760
-Forget. What else?

521
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:45,590
-I tried Alumina.
-Next?

522
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:48,580
-Nat mur.
-Next.

523
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:49,340
-Causticum.
-Next?

524
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:53,350
-Magnesia muriatica.
-Next.

525
01:03:53,450 --> 01:03:56,350
-Sepia.
-Next?

526
01:03:56,450 --> 01:03:59,940
-Collinsonia.
-Next? No next.

527
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:06,940
What happens in this case is like this.

528
01:04:08,690 --> 01:04:14,080
-Also Argentum nitricum.
-That's the correct.

529
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:27,090
What happens in this case, if you understand the pathology, you understand the remedy.

530
01:04:27,190 --> 01:04:36,640
What happens in this case is wrong peristalsis. Instead of going... it goes back.

531
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:42,170
And the remedy is Asafoetida.

532
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:59,680
Everybody is happy with Asafoetida?
-Yes.

533
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:07,090
-You don't like it? You gave Asafoetida?

534
01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:14,420
-No, I thought about it and I read in the books that it has the wrong peristalsis

535
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:19,750
only in the esophagus. So it was partial...

536
01:05:19,850 --> 01:05:30,410
-What is this? Esophagus? It is one digestive system from here to the rectum is one system.

537
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:39,820
But your question was to show you how a homeopath should think.

538
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:47,730
In this case you think about the pathology, what really happens and then the remedy comes.

539
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:11,650
The issue of symptomatology or use, it appears during aggravation as appears

540
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:13,490
and then disappears.

541
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:23,150
How much weight do you give this during evaluation of the case and the repertorization?

542
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:34,990
If a symptom appears after the remedy as an aggravation,

543
01:06:35,090 --> 01:06:39,960
the symptom goes away after few days,

544
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:47,970
then it has the following value.

545
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:56,470
If the symptom belongs to the pathogenesis of the remedy, it confirms your prescription.

546
01:06:56,570 --> 01:06:59,570
That means the remedy was correct.

547
01:07:00,830 --> 01:07:07,940
If it does not belong to the pathogenesis, if the case is cured, that means

548
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:16,930
that the new symptom that appeared belongs to the pathogenesis of the case.

549
01:07:17,030 --> 01:07:25,970
If the new symptom appears, without the patient being cured, it's a useless symptom

550
01:07:26,070 --> 01:07:31,280
which you don't pay attention because you don't know why it appeared.
