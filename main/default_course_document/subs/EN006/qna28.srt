1
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:26,770
-How high you would go as far as potencies with the people that are over 70 years old?

2
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:46,010
-The highest 200 but if it is a strong case of a farmer, then you can go 10M even.

3
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:55,200
Because 70 years old a bower no problem, lumbago no problem.

4
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:03,550
-George in one book you mentioned something about inimical remedies

5
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:11,060
and it is dangerous or difficult to use them instead of simili.

6
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,390
Can you explain something on this?

7
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,130
-Yes, when we say inimical remedies, we only mean remedies

8
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:25,560
which have similar symptomatology.

9
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,960
If the symptomatology of two remedies is quite similar these two are inimical.

10
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:40,960
That means if you are given one of these and it has acted, don't give another

11
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:46,310
which is very similar because most probably you will be disturbing the case.

12
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:54,900
But this is not for this level. I did not talk because later on when you have more remedies

13
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,800
then you see what is similar and what is dissimilar in remedies.

14
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:14,600
-I have two questions please. The one is if there is an eruption in each full state,

15
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:28,120
would you give another potency than in an eruption where there is a big suppression?

16
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:39,040
-There is a full blown eruption after a remedy?
-No.

17
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:47,260
-He comes for the first time and we give one potency.

18
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,760
-200.

19
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:55,260
-Yes. If it would be the same case but with suppression of the eruption,

20
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:02,610
would you give another potency?
-No, the same potency.

21
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:13,500
-If we expect an aggravation of the skin and the remedy we have chosen

22
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:21,500
it is known in its provings that we have a great skin eruption,

23
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,360
does this influence the choice of the potency?

24
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:35,190
-No, what you have to be careful only in skin eruptions is Sulphur.

25
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:43,920
In skin eruptions if you give Sulphur and Sulphur is not the correct remedy,

26
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:51,270
it's going to aggravate the skin eruption without amelioration.

27
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,910
It will aggravate, aggravate... You wait for amelioration, nothing.

28
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:05,370
Because Sulphur produces a lot of eruptions.

29
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:09,080
So in this case also you have to be careful with Graphites

30
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,490
because it produces a lot of eruptions and you have to be careful

31
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:19,130
especially of Sulphur in skin eruptions.

32
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:25,000
-May I ask a question? That came up in the morning session with me.

33
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,540
In Germany right now it's quite common, I know some patients

34
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,330
who use a cream containing uric acid to treat their skin.

35
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:40,070
It doesn't have any cortisone or any other contents but it contains uric acid.

36
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:44,590
And I would like to know if you consider this also as a suppression or not

37
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:48,080
because I'm treating people who have all skin conditions.

38
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,570
I'm expecting them to come up but they say if it doesn't work,

39
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,680
they put this on and it gets better. How to deal with this?

40
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:03,330
-I don't know. I did not know it exists such a thing and I don't know how effective it is.

41
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:08,370
If it is effective, that means if it suppresses, then you have to avoid it.

42
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:15,470
-But they have cracked skin and that heals, if they put it on.

43
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,930
-I have seen a depression developing after treatment of the gums.

44
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:39,160
The dentist treated the gums and the inflammation in the gums went away

45
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:43,870
and a depression followed.

46
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:48,350
I gave the remedy and the inflammation of the gums came back.

47
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,410
You remember a case, I don't know if somebody was in Celle?

48
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:16,660
A case of severe multiple sclerosis who developed after the suppression

49
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:21,410
of a little eruption on the knees.

50
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:28,680
He suppressed that eruption and then he developed multiple sclerosis symptoms.
