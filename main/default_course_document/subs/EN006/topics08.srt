1
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,180
Have you heard the memory of the water?

2
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,180
Who has heard the memory of the water?

3
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:44,880
Who knows who brought this idea?

4
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,220
What was the name of the doctor who brought this idea?

5
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:57,730
Only one person knows? Do you know Benveniste's experiment?

6
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:12,120
Benveniste made an experiment in which he said certain things.

7
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:28,640
He said that if you give a high potency, you can cause structural changesin living organisms.

8
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:35,540
So he made an experiment and he took the poison from the bees

9
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:43,650
and gave it to cells and there was a degranulation of basophils.

10
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:50,790
Then he took a potency beyond the Avogadro's number and he put this

11
00:01:50,890 --> 00:02:01,150
and he said that I found that degranulation of basophils is happening under this high potency.

12
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:10,380
The story was heard by the world and most of the homeopaths even today

13
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:18,060
they don't know what is about the real story. So I want to tell you the real story.

14
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:29,160
The real story is that in 1988, in Temple University of United States,

15
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:38,410
the biggest University in Philadelphia in United States invited 25 Professors,

16
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:46,410
different kind of Professors, not only from Medicine, Physics, Biochemistry etc.

17
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:56,010
in a discussion group, in which they talked about the frontiers of science.

18
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:08,080
This was the theme and the Temple University had invited these people to discuss.

19
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:14,850
I was also invited in the main group for the discussion.

20
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:24,990
So Benveniste came and spoke about his experiment.

21
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:32,000
He said I found something entirely beyond fantasy, entirely new,

22
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,840
it is beyond the frontiers of science.

23
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:44,830
Why? Because I did this experiment and I found out that a high potency containing

24
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:58,180
not one molecule of the real remedy, that means poison, had the same effect as the poison itself.

25
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:10,330
So 25 people are there, 2 of them with Nobel Prizes, all of them Professors in their specialty

26
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,830
but no one was a homeopath.

27
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:17,250
I was the only one I understood what he said.

28
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:32,330
I said my god. All these people stayed with the mouth open. They said is that possible?

29
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:40,430
I said wait a moment, I don't think that this experiment is correct.

30
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:50,340
The moment I pronounced this word, he comes out with such violence.

31
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,440
He says you cannot...

32
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,570
I stepped back and I said forget it, I don't want to fight here,

33
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:04,750
I just want to say my opinion where nobody heard my opinion.

34
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:10,740
But in the outside circle, there were several scientists observing.

35
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:18,670
One of them was a Professor of Immunology in Jerusalem University...

36
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:27,070
Zwei Bentuits was his name, whom I knew before because we had exchanged ideas

37
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:34,830
about Homeopathy and after the presentation was finished...

38
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:43,340
In which presentation, I must tell you, Benveniste asked these people who were present

39
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:53,320
to exercise their influence upon 'Nature', the most high scientific magazine,

40
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:58,710
'Nature' is called, to publish this paper.

41
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:06,570
Zwei Bentuits is hearing all that, he is hearing my reaction, he comes to me and says

42
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:10,830
George tell me why you had objections.

43
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:17,840
I said it's not possible this to happen and I explained the reason.

44
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,240
I will explain to you also.

45
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:33,240
He said I understand what you are saying but in our laboratory in Jerusalem,

46
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:42,990
we were trying to confirm this experiment and we were not able to confirm it.

47
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:50,740
I said sure because this cannot happen, what he says is entirely false.

48
00:06:53,090 --> 00:07:01,480
So he says it's good that we discussed because I will withdraw from this experiment.

49
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:06,150
So he withdrew from the experiment.

50
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:13,240
But in the meantime in 'New York Times' in the first page there was the experiment,

51
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:18,480
the memory of the water, Benveniste found out that the water has memory

52
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:25,090
and that Homeopathy is correct because it acts...

53
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:37,160
I said oh my god. Then I call Zwei and I say it's going to back fire what he says.

54
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:46,820
'Nature' said I will publish your paper but I don't believe it.

55
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:58,070
So therefore I publish it under the condition that I will make a committee of 3 scientists

56
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:06,830
to come to Paris to your laboratory and show them the degranulation of basophils

57
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,180
under the microscope.

58
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:16,570
Benveniste agreed and the paper was published in 'Nature'.

59
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:23,320
Soon after 'Nature' sent 3 scientists and what they thought?

60
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:28,580
They thought that maybe he will do some under hand manipulation,

61
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:37,820
so we have to send together with these 3 scientists, a magician who knows all the tricks,

62
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:42,930
Mr. Randi, Randi the magician.

63
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:55,820
So they go to his laboratory and of course they could not find anything.

64
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,910
So he could not prove it.

65
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:07,660
There was a big scandal, he lost his professorship, he lost his laboratory,

66
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,630
he lost his clients, he was one of the best allergiologists,

67
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:16,820
he was reduced to nothing because in science,

68
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,880
in the scientific world if you make such a mistake, you can forget about existing.

69
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,640
They reduce you to pieces.

70
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:36,040
Later on I invited in Alonissos all the scientists they were doing some research

71
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:44,260
and I told them if you make a research on Homeopathy please have with you as an advisor

72
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:50,300
somebody who knows Homeopathy, so you don't make such mistakes.

73
00:09:50,610 --> 00:10:01,270
In Homeopathy the potency cannot create the same effect as the poison.

74
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:11,520
Because if that is true, you use Arsenicum album and you give 200 potency,

75
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:17,520
I would be poisoned. Hydrocyanic acid we use.

76
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:27,510
You can imagine that I take a potency that may have the same effect as the real poison?

77
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:37,760
So what they were is that the potency had the same effect causing structural changes,

78
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:42,260
damages in the living organisms.

79
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:48,020
It was a crazy idea all together if that was true.

80
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,180
We would have proved Homeopathy anything.

81
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:57,290
We would say OK I'll poison you with the Arsenicum 200. Take the Arsenicum...

82
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:10,180
On the contrary the symptoms which are caused by the poison are eliminated

83
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:14,350
by the high potency. It's the opposite.

84
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:22,840
So I told them you can poison yourselves with Apis mellifica

85
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:31,980
and give a high potency of Apis and save, prevent from being degranulated.

86
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:39,010
Prevent them from being degranulated because they are sick now with the poison

87
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:43,770
and they have not completely died.

88
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:52,440
OK, give the high potency and the high potency will prevent degranulation.

89
00:11:52,540 --> 00:12:03,930
Otherwise it is totally crazy to think that we can give Lachesis and all the poisons

90
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:10,770
and create the same effect as the real poison.

91
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:18,530
But yet a lot of homeopaths, even today, not knowing exactly what is happening

92
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:27,510
believe first of all that Benveniste was right, the experiment proved Homeopathy.

93
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:33,260
Actually all the attacks we receive was because of such experiments

94
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,850
which are proven to be false.

95
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:48,250
You cannot base your arguments in favor of Homeopathy in a wrong experiment.

96
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,350
That was totally wrong.

97
00:12:52,070 --> 00:13:00,580
You understand the implications of even thinking or discussing about the possibility

98
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:07,080
of Benveniste experiment is a correct experiment? It was a wrong experiment.

99
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:15,830
Several years later, a group, the Anis group they call it, they said we found out

100
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:22,350
that the experiment of Benveniste was correct.

101
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:33,750
So this time instead of 'Nature', the BBC took the initiative and they said OK

102
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:38,000
if you believe that this experiment was really correct,

103
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:49,100
we will film what you found, your findings and we will tell to the world Homeopathy is correct.

104
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:57,420
So this group of 4 scientists agreed to do the experiment.

105
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,280
10 years later after all this...

106
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:11,920
Of course the BBC called again Mr. Randi and said you go there and see that

107
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:16,810
no trick will take place.

108
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:25,590
Mr. Randi was there and they could not show anything.

109
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:33,180
The BBC came in the Horizon program...

110
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:46,440
Has anybody seen this program with the Homeopathy?

111
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,820
You remember what they said to the end?

112
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:57,580
Homeopathy is rubbish and you may wait for another 100 years before we talk again.

113
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:06,330
I was mad, I wrote a letter to the editor and I said this experiment

114
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:13,100
on which you accuse Homeopathy was a wrong experiment from its conception.

115
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:19,000
And I have denounced this experiment from the very beginning

116
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:24,500
but you want to present that this experiment was an experiment

117
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:30,920
which never proved Homeopathy, in spite of claiming that proved Homeopathy.

118
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,430
You want to ridicule Homeopathy.

119
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:43,370
We had a kind of correspondence with the editor, Mr. Barrett and Williams,

120
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:47,500
I think was the name of the editor in the Horizon program.

121
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:55,750
He wrote if what you say is true, we have to rewrite science.

122
00:15:55,850 --> 00:16:05,000
I said yes you may rewrite science, wait you may understand a few things about science later on.

123
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,410
So we had a big correspondence...

124
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:20,160
And the fact is that from this correspondence some of the skeptics came to me

125
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:27,070
and they said, you claim that high potencies have an effect? I said yes.

126
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:35,320
Can you prove that potencies have an effect on the human organism?

127
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,820
I said yes, I can prove.

128
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:49,490
They said do you agree to do an experiment with us, the skeptics and yourself with a group?

129
00:16:49,590 --> 00:17:00,480
I said yes. They said OK we start writing the protocol for such an experiment.

130
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:11,240
The skeptics found 5 very reputed scientists together with me that we wrote

131
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:15,360
a protocol for proving high potencies.

132
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:26,230
There were papers signed and who was the head of the skeptics?

133
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:31,400
You can imagine. It was Mr. Randi.

134
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:36,390
Mr. Randi was signing the agreements with us.

135
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:46,890
Because he had put in his web site that if anybody proves the high potencies action,

136
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:50,740
he will get 1.000.000 $.

137
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,670
I said I want this million.

138
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:04,820
For two years we write the protocol to make it as perfect as possible,

139
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:10,590
that there is no possibility that we can cheat, under no circumstances

140
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:16,310
and then the next problem was to find a hospital on which to do the experiment.

141
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:22,740
Because we needed a hospital to do an experiment with human beings.

142
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:35,060
I put all my influence, all the political influence I had, in order to have a public hospital.

143
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:46,300
Finally we found a public hospital to accept with their scientific committees deciding...

144
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,400
it's a lot of work.

145
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:59,730
We found the hospital, we are ready and the hospital is the Municipality Hospital of Athens.

146
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:05,970
I said to them, we found the hospital, we have to start immediately

147
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:14,990
because the woman who was the Mayor was my friend and ordered the hospital

148
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:19,670
to accept to do the experiment.

149
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:27,650
She will go out in one year because new elections and we knew who was going to be

150
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:33,650
the new Mayor of Athens, he was a medical doctor.

151
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:40,650
I said we have to start. Once we start there is no way to stop us. Please start.

152
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:50,240
After a lot of correspondence, we are in the 5th year...

153
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:59,390
We receive a letter, they say we cannot start. Why?

154
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:07,980
Because Mr. Randi is ill and he cannot come to Athens.

155
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:14,220
I said for god shake, we have to start. What is the problem?

156
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:21,170
Mr. Randi is ill. I said we have to start until next June

157
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:27,880
because from there starts the new Mayor, he starts on September,

158
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:34,140
we have to have at least 3 months to have started the experiment.

159
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,650
We received a letter, Mr. Randi is sick and most probably he will be sick

160
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:45,890
until the 10th of July. I said oh my god...

161
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:57,890
I wrote angry letters. No, no that's it.

162
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:06,140
Mr. Randi can come after 10th of July where his energy will be good.

163
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,140
Then what happens? We had elections in Athens, the new Mayor

164
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:24,140
was the medical doctor, we knew.

165
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:33,910
We had no influence in this medical doctor. He was against Homeopathy actually.

166
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:44,300
I said OK, I will try to influence this medical doctor, the Mayor.

167
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,560
I put all the people I have treated on the government,

168
00:21:48,660 --> 00:22:00,720
I put them speaking to the Mayor to say you accept to give an order to the hospital and to continue...

169
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:06,380
They pressurized and pressurized and eventually all things...

170
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:12,380
The committee which had changed already, the President of the hospital was persuaded,

171
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,170
the committee was persuaded, everything is correct...

172
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:33,470
Some of the skeptics were here, we were finalizing the last details of the experiment and suddenly...

173
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:59,620
We were here, the skeptics together with my team, we were arranging the last arrangements

174
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,570
and I'll tell you the last what it was.

175
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:16,990
That a robot could make the selection, so no human would be involved in who takes the remedy,

176
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:20,590
the potency and who takes the placebo.

177
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:28,980
50-50 would be there. 50 people would take the remedy and 50% would take the placebo.

178
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:39,490
And we had to point out that this and this and that person got the potency.

179
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:46,740
Not that they were cured or not, we had agreed that we will be able to spot

180
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:53,330
who had taken the remedies in potencies. That's all.

181
00:23:53,840 --> 00:24:02,230
Which was very easy actually because we would give repeated doses of 30,

182
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:09,890
we had agreed on 30 potencies and some of the people would show some provings.

183
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,630
Some of them they would be cured, some would show some provings.

184
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:20,960
We had a whole strategy how to spot these people.

185
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:27,710
We had to spot 50 people who have taken the remedy.

186
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:33,960
We could see as many as we like but for 50 people we would have to say that

187
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,800
these 50 they have taken the remedy.

188
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,090
If we were correct in the 70%, we would get the one million.

189
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:50,980
I said fine, we are starting in two more months.

190
00:24:52,230 --> 00:25:01,040
At this moment Mr. Randi sends a letter saying because George Vithoulkas

191
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:12,060
is an aggressive individual, I want to start the process all over again.

192
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:21,960
Not only that but you do it first yourselves, see that it is really active

193
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:26,720
and then we will repeat it.

194
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:36,460
That means 5 years of spending hours, spending energy, he just throws it out.

195
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:43,130
I said but you have signed and you have said I agree with all these condition.

196
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:45,990
Now suddenly...

197
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:58,550
If you go to our website www.vithoulkas.com and you put Randi, you will see the story,

198
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:07,520
you will see some of the letters that they were transpired.

199
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:19,630
So this experiment was the continuation of the Benveniste stupidity.

200
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:26,030
I don't want to say that he did it on purpose because that would be absolutely stupid

201
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:34,530
but his ambition to get the Nobel prize or what he thought...

202
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:43,270
breaking the frontiers of science with an experiment proving high potencies in such a way

203
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:50,850
it was a terrible mistake and you should denounce, when you speak.

204
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:55,210
You should denounce this experiment as a false experiment and say we know this experiment

205
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,950
as a false experiment.

206
00:26:57,050 --> 00:27:06,050
You cannot base your attack against Homeopathy on an experiment that had no credibility.

207
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,950
All these fightings...

208
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:17,200
Of course you may think poor George, that is true.

209
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:24,560
Except of all other things, I had to do all this in order to save the name of Homeopathy.
