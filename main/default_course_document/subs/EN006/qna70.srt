1
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:35,000
-Looking at the amount of the questions that you are put, first thing that comes to my mind

2
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,180
is that I need another seminar to answer the questions.

3
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:44,930
The second is that I left you with too many questions.

4
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:55,580
-First question is which remedies are the most suitable to soothen the pain,

5
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,530
which arises after an operation, with which for example a lung

6
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:07,220
is taken out in relation to cancer?

7
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:18,760
-Well if I knew that I would be the most popular man in medicine.

8
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,910
It will depend after an operation.

9
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:29,170
You don't give a remedy just because there is a cut.

10
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:39,410
The pains of an operation usually will not last long.

11
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:44,670
If you have pains that will stay after the normal period of the operation

12
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:51,240
that they should stay, then what I would do I would take the general state of the patient

13
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:58,190
and prescribe according to the general state, not according to the pain.

14
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:08,680
We have remedies like Staphysagria for instance, even Ledum

15
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:15,820
but I would not base a prescription upon these legends.

16
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:21,610
Mostly, if we have to be effective in such cases,

17
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:27,910
we have to take the whole symptomatology at the time of the suffering.

18
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:35,270
We have to take everything that is possible to make a good recovery for the patient.

19
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,770
At least I have not used Homeopathy in that way.

20
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:52,390
I have knowledge about different remedies but I never used them in this way.

21
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:56,140
For these kind of pains, these kind of remedies.

22
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,200
I don't want to give you that impression ever.

23
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:13,110
-When the teeth have a lot of amalgam with a high potential difference,

24
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:21,990
which you can see in electro - Acupuncture how far is this blockage for homeopathic remedies?

25
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:32,720
-I have had certain people practitioners, especially in America,

26
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:43,300
talking about this problem with amalgam in the teeth and there is a differential

27
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:49,300
on the potential and there is some pain, which is appearing.

28
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:56,780
But I do not have the experience myself.

29
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:04,020
Those people that they have given me the information said it was blocking really

30
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:10,610
the treatment and they had to take all the fillings out and refill them with gold.

31
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:15,780
But this is not my personal experience. It might be so.

32
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:26,690
-Could you give us a list of remedies you think of in a person characterized

33
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:30,540
by the word 'workaholic'?

34
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,930
-I'll give you.

35
00:04:52,030 --> 00:05:04,190
Aurum will be one, Nux vomica will be another one, Tarentula will be another one,

36
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:12,040
Kalis, the Kali carbonicum especially, the Kali bichromicum.

37
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,190
For different reasons it depends what you mean workaholic.

38
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:38,120
Sometimes the desire for work has to be excessive, too much, to take it as a symptom.

39
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:45,350
Because in the society in which we live and under the conditions in which we live,

40
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:52,950
we tend to work on a very fast pace.

41
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:59,850
So I would not consider that as a symptom, unless it is very excessive

42
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:03,610
and more or less these remedies can be considered.

43
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,740
It doesn't mean that one of them will be indicated.

44
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:19,720
-There are several questions about the companies who make homeopathic remedies.

45
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,810
So there is the question, where do your remedies come from?

46
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:29,150
What factory or which firms do you recommend?

47
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:42,700
-You are asking me to stick my throat out so that somebody can cut it.

48
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,550
This is a big question for me also.

49
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:59,100
In Athens initially we used the Nelson's medicines, when Mr Every was in Nelson's pharmacy.

50
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:07,100
Mr Every was a person that was killed in an accident where several English homeopaths,

51
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:12,100
the most prominent died actually, died in a crash airplane accident,

52
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:24,350
going over to the Congress around 1970-1. He died during that accident.

53
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:31,850
He was responsible for preparation of homeopathic remedies in Nelson's.

54
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:42,430
Nelson's were quite reliable at the moment I was using it and by this time we bought

55
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:46,820
and we used in Athens from Nelson's pharmacy.

56
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,030
The story I hear is that they had remedies, the high potencies,

57
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:57,360
from Boericke and Tafel in America, in Philadelphia.

58
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:01,600
Most probably they were old remedies of Boericke and Tafel that they have kept

59
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:10,690
and they have repotentised. I'm not sure now what is the situation.

60
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:27,060
What I would like to see is repotentising of high potencies to very high degree, like 10M,

61
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:33,800
50 M etc. I would like to see somebody who would do it all over again.

62
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:40,810
And he will take the responsibility and he will say I have done it, you can try

63
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:47,610
and test these remedies. I would like that to happen.

64
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:58,950
I hear there is a new firm who is arising in Brussels and they say they have done it.

65
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:07,100
I don't know, I have been just given a few remedies to try them.

66
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:14,700
Another good source I would say is Borneman of America up to 200.

67
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:19,110
I have tested the remedies as well and they are good.

68
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:28,850
Ainsworth is the same as the old potencies of Nelson's, I don't know how he repotentised.

69
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:37,690
All these are kind of secrets that if you go and investigate, they are not very happy

70
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:43,760
and neither you can know what is really going on, unless you take the remedy,

71
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:52,730
you applied it, it works and then what you can do if the remedy works and works really,

72
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:55,730
you put a red mark on the bottle.

73
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,060
So you know, otherwise you forget.

74
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,400
This remedy that you prescribed 1M from Carbo vegetabilis it works.

75
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:11,350
Put a red mark in that bottle. So you know next time that this bottle has acted.

76
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:18,780
In this way you can have some reliable remedies.

77
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:25,730
It is a very big problem with the high potencies because they cannot be detected

78
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:30,580
whether they are potent or not. Only if you give it to them.

79
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:35,060
Last year in America I had this experience.

80
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:40,810
I prescribed in a class, somebody felt very ill in a class

81
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:49,570
with symptoms of Carbo vegetabilis. We were having in the hotel of the Conference.

82
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:55,060
So I prescribed, I said you are having Carbo vegetabilis 1M, he was given

83
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,390
and he was put in a room upstairs.

84
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:02,640
After I finished the class, I went to see him because he was really very sick,

85
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:09,230
he was almost collapsed as he was sitting there, with vomiting, diarrheas etc.

86
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:16,480
One hour after when I went to see him he was not better. I said how you are?

87
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,480
He said I'm the same.

88
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:24,810
And he said because he knew Homeopathy of course, I think I'm Arsenicum

89
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:32,060
because I have fear of death. He tried to persuade me that he was Arsenicum.

90
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:42,150
I could have believed him also because he is telling symptoms but for me

91
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:47,640
this case was Carbo vegetabilis. So I say how it does not work?

92
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:55,640
So by chance that day I have been given 200's from Borneman and I had them with me.

93
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:00,890
So I take 200 Carbo vegetabilis, I give it to him and say take this

94
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,230
if in 10 minutes you are not better...

95
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,980
Because these remedies if they are acting in such severe cases,

96
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:11,720
the man was completely exhausted, almost dying there from exhaustion, from vomiting,

97
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,350
he was in a terrible state.

98
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,840
The remedy must activate quickly in such cases.

99
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:18,590
The more severe they are, the remedy is correct, then it will act.

100
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:21,090
You don't have to wait for hours.

101
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:28,350
I said in 10 minutes if you see no difference, take Arsenicum because he was feeling cold.

102
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:39,560
He took Carbo vegetabilis 200 and within 3 minutes he came back to life.

103
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:48,160
One hour later he was driving back home, it was 50 km away.

104
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:54,960
And I had given 1M and it didn't work.

105
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:58,700
And the people who gave the 1M, they said it has worked before

106
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,300
but it has been spoiled in between the process.

107
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:08,960
The first 1M I gave it was nothing, the remedy was finished.

108
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,200
Because the remedy definitely was Carbo vegetabilis, I could see Carbo vegetabilis,

109
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,300
I could see it so much as to insist.

110
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:33,300
Usually I know what I'm doing. So this is Carbo vegetabilis, why it doesn't work?

111
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:39,040
But most people they don't have that kind of experience, so they are not able to check

112
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,790
and I understand that.

113
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:49,880
With me it's a little bit different. When I give a remedy and I say this is a typical case

114
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:55,130
of Nux vomica, it has to act. If it does not act, I take another potency, lower, higher

115
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,810
and see what happens.

116
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:05,300
In this way we may find eventually some remedies which are good but not in another way.

117
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:13,950
At this moment the pharmaceutical companies have to compete very much and they have

118
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:22,210
to produce reliable remedies in order that we feel secure that the remedy that we give

119
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:27,210
is a remedy and therefore if it has not acted, then we go to another remedy.

120
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:30,060
But at this moment I'm not sure.

121
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,700
I give another case. In America I prescribed a very difficult case, a mental case

122
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,210
I prescribed Phosphorus 50M because for me it was Phosphorus, clear.

123
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:49,460
I prescribed 50M Phosphorus and the practitioner comes and says it has acted a little bit,

124
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:55,310
it has changed a little bit. I don't think it's the right remedy.

125
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:05,460
The way it was described was as if I had given a 12C, not a 50M.

126
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,710
Like acting for a few days and then back again.

127
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:12,310
I said OK give again 200.

128
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:21,210
200, a big reaction and the patient got a very curative response.

129
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:29,460
He was very sick, which for me it indicated that this 50M was not potentised properly

130
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:38,630
but it was put in -what they call- a fluxion continuous that they have here the remedy 12X

131
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,870
and they inject water with force.

132
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:47,130
The water goes through and potentises this and after two hours they say

133
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:58,230
this has been shaken 50.000 times, so this is 50M, take it. You drink it. It's water.

134
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:11,210
-You explained that the mental base of a human being cannot be changed by Homeopathy.

135
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:17,210
It can only take away the disturbances that have come during the life.

136
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:22,660
In your book you have written something about the relation between homeopathic treatment

137
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,410
and the karma of human being.

138
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:29,410
It was one of the pages I did not understand quite well.

139
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:35,910
Sometimes I see children who start their life full of troubles, I see they are not happy

140
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:39,410
and they suffer more than they should be.

141
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:44,650
This has something to do with the karma they are suffering from

142
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:49,850
and can we treat that form of basic unhappiness in children?

143
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:01,000
-I don't remember where I wrote about the karma.

144
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,740
There are different questions here. I don't understand very well the question

145
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:11,890
but I put another question to you and as it has been put to me several times.

146
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:19,990
I will tell you also what I meant. If I wrote something, it must be to that import.

147
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:26,590
The question is, many times I have been asked this question.

148
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:38,490
If suffering is a means through which a person has to learn certain things,

149
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:45,490
if suffering is a way of involvement, a spiritual kind of involvement

150
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:50,810
for the human being he has to suffer to understand certain things and then he can proceed,

151
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:57,560
the question is you come as a homeopath and you give a remedy and stop the suffering.

152
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:01,450
What is your right to do that? That's one question.

153
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:08,810
Do you have the right to do that or you stop the spiritual progress of that person?

154
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:15,740
That seems a legitimate question. The answer is that

155
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:25,040
we are healers and our mission is to take away suffering from the people.

156
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:33,040
Therefore we have to do the best to our possibilities and abilities to take away

157
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:37,570
that suffering from that person.

158
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:46,790
Whether this suffering will be really taken away or not is not a matter of concern to us.

159
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:50,050
What we have to do is to apply to the best of our abilities,

160
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:57,080
the best knowledge we have and we have the duty to learn, as much as possible,

161
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:01,670
this science in order to be able to be effective.

162
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:07,130
Will everybody be cured? That's another question.

163
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:14,870
In my practice I have seen several things.

164
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:19,410
Just as an observer, the persons came, asked me for a remedy.

165
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:24,410
He confessed to me that he has done a murder, sometimes they confess,

166
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:31,160
they want somebody to talk, they have stolen things, they have done all kinds of broken laws

167
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:40,380
and then you are thinking shall I give him a remedy? Let him suffer. He has killed people.

168
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,980
He suffers, it's good. No.

169
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:49,720
We cannot judge if he suffers still.

170
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:56,880
What we must do is to find the remedy and I'll try as much as I will try with an angel

171
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:05,870
to cure him. If an angel was in front of me, it's the same effort. My duty is to relieve him.

172
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:11,120
Whether he will be cured it's another thing because I have seen certain cases

173
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:16,710
where I have given the right remedy and I told them also don't drink coffee

174
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:23,300
or don't take other remedies etc. Severe cases.

175
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,040
I remember a case of pheochromocytoma.

176
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:34,880
For those who don't know the word, it is a malignant tumor in the suprarenal glands,

177
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:43,620
which as a main symptom has the rising of blood pressure, very suddenly,

178
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:50,220
very high and the people are constantly under the threat of having a brain stroke.

179
00:20:53,010 --> 00:21:02,470
The man came. He was a teacher and the treatment for that disease is surgery.

180
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:10,630
The man came and the doctor who took the case, he comes to me

181
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:13,380
and says he has pheochromocytoma.

182
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:19,310
So I go inside and say sir we cannot take your case, I'm sorry.

183
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:23,210
He says why? Because you have to be operated, this is the normal procedure.

184
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:30,660
We cannot act because of the consequences and you know the consequences.

185
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,210
He says yes but I have not decided to make the operation.

186
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:38,460
I said this is your decision and I tried to go away.

187
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:42,950
He calls me back, he says please I'm going to die if you don't treat me.

188
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:46,460
Because I'm not going to take the operation, I'm afraid so much,

189
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,960
I'm afraid I'm going to die during the operation, so I'm not going to take the operation,

190
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:56,040
so please. He pleaded and pleaded to take his case.

191
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:04,620
So I said OK I will take your case. I sit with the doctor and it was a case of Staphysagria.

192
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,630
I prescribed Staphysagria 10M. He was taking antihypertensive drugs.

193
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:21,730
I stopped this and I gave the Staphysagria 10M. It was a beautiful reaction.

194
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:31,370
The blood pressure went down, the man was living outside of Athens

195
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:41,620
and what happened is that one day he got a cold and instead of trying to communicate with us,

196
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:47,490
he went to the doctor. The doctor said you bronchitis, you have to take antibiotics.

197
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:55,410
He took the antibiotics and soon enough the whole syndrome started again.

198
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,600
After the blood pressure was up, he comes to Athens for a second interview,

199
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:07,090
he tells all this, how well he was and how he took the antibiotics

200
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:12,840
and after the antibiotics it was a relapse.

201
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:17,700
We prescribed again Staphysagria and again it works.

202
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:25,940
It brings down the blood pressure until he develops an abscess on his tooth.

203
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:36,840
He goes to the dentist, he treats the abscess, the dentist tries to kill the nerve,

204
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:50,590
he uses a lot of injections for anesthesia and one day coming out of the doctor's office

205
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:56,310
that he has been a few times, he fell down with high blood pressure.

206
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,410
The blood pressure shoot up again.

207
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:04,440
They take him with the ambulance to the hospital in Athens.

208
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:12,100
They knew the diagnosis and the hospital was roaring against me.

209
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:22,000
Vithoulkas, pheochromocytoma, he tried to cure you. The whole hospital ...

210
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:29,520
So he got so scared, in the hospital he didn't say a word about what has happened.

211
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:34,930
Anyhow they said we must operate you. They took him, whether he wanted or not,

212
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:41,480
he was operated. During the operation it was found not exactly pheochromocytoma,

213
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:45,970
it was found a kind of malignancy but it was not exactly that malignancy

214
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:51,760
which they expect usually in pheochromocytoma, which to me it shows that

215
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:54,810
it had started already a process of recovery.

216
00:24:54,910 --> 00:25:00,100
And unless this man had not stopped the treatment, he would have been well.

217
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:06,840
Now this is what I call karma. This is not my responsibility.

218
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:14,280
His karma was to suffer and to go through all these experiences.

219
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:19,930
This looking backwards, I would say this is his karma.

220
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:26,430
Like another man many times you give a remedy, he does something and he antidotes

221
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:29,360
and he does not come back to you.

222
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:33,840
He says nothing happened because I was well only for 3 months and then

223
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,340
the whole situation came back and he does not come back.

224
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:42,560
And after 3 years, after going through many other doctors, they come to me again.

225
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:46,560
They say do you remember I had come 3 years ago and for 3 months I was better

226
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:49,810
but then I took this, this and that and then I had a relapse

227
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:53,110
and for 3 years he was suffering.

228
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:59,140
I give again the remedy, it works, we explain to him that he should not antidote.

229
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:04,150
He did well. Now for 3 years that he was suffering, was my fault?

230
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:10,910
Was I deciding whether he should suffer? Somebody else was deciding. This I call karma.

231
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,940
His fate was to suffer another 3 years.

232
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:25,840
This is most probably what I write and what I feel concerning this question of karma.

233
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:32,340
The children they will come suffering. I will try everything to stop suffering of the children.

234
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,530
Of course. There is no question about that.

235
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:42,170
Whether the child will be corrected or not it's another story all together.

236
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:50,520
I have seen autistic children, very severe mentally ill children.

237
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:56,390
Some they have stayed for treatment for years.

238
00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:07,240
We have a child from 67, 18 years, he is 25 now.

239
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:14,680
He is not completely well but he can live in the society.

240
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:19,030
He does things with his hands, he can buy things, he can talk.

241
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:27,030
He stayed 18 years in treatment. Other autistic children one time, no effect, they go away.

242
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,010
This is their karma, this is what we call their karma.

243
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:37,510
I'm not deciding whether I shall give the right remedy or the wrong remedy or because

244
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:44,270
you have been a murderer I'm not going to give you a remedy. This I've never thought.

245
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:47,020
It has never crossed my mind. People come and say how do you do that?

246
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:53,520
This man has to suffer but I'm not a judge,

247
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:56,370
I'm not god to say whether he should suffer or not.

248
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:07,680
-How can the illness AIDS be cured with Homeopathy since there is a state of weakness

249
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:10,030
and hardly any felt symptoms?

250
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:19,220
-This is also what I have said that treating AIDS is going to be very difficult

251
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:24,610
because of these reasons. Because we have very few symptoms and only weakness.

252
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:31,510
Before we can make a verdict, before we can say that we can do something,

253
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:38,860
we have to have an experience, we have to have an experiment with such 100 people.

254
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:44,020
I have proposed many times and I have spoken, the BBC had come

255
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:52,010
and made a film last month on my life, my works and there I had spoken

256
00:28:52,110 --> 00:29:02,460
and said publically that we in Homeopathy are willing to make and experiment concerning AIDS

257
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:07,110
to see what can be the effect of Homeopathy on AIDS.

258
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:14,520
And it's my belief that it will be the best possible treatment.

259
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:19,010
If there is a possibility for 10% of these people to be saved or 20% or 30%,

260
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:23,270
I don't know at this time but I believe because we stimulate the immune system,

261
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:27,010
we help the immune system through Homeopathy, this is the main thing we do.

262
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:31,540
I believe this is going to be the best way of treatment but at this moment

263
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,940
I cannot say definitely we can cure.

264
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:44,200
-Can you say what a rubric in the Repertory means 'pulling of hair' and what kind of

265
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,480
pulling belongs to Lilium tigrinum?

266
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:58,030
-Pulling of hair is an impulse to pull the hair of somebody who is near you.

267
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:08,170
Pulling the hair is an impulse, like we have so many crazy things that

268
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:15,180
in the human race. That's one of these crazy things, especially long hair and...

269
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:25,960
It's an impulse, let's pull this. The other one has the impulse to spit, they cannot hold it.

270
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:33,810
This is what it means. Pulling the hair it means an insane impulse.

271
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:38,510
You cannot say that the person who has this impulse is insane

272
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:51,400
but to pull the hair of somebody is a 'natural way' of letting your emotions to be expressed.

273
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:05,390
-Can we speak of blockade also when an organ is extirpated like the uterus?

274
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:17,510
-No, I don't think that this can become a problem because the uterus is out

275
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:29,940
as long as it's not an important organ. The organism can work quite well with one kidney.

276
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,880
You have one kidney out and it can be a very healthy person.

277
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:40,320
Of course if you take both kidneys out, it's another story.

278
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:46,470
But always it will be left with some sensitivities perhaps.

279
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:50,960
The person will be more sensitive to say urinary infections,

280
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:57,610
more sensitive to throat infections, if you take away the tonsils.

281
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:05,110
They are performing some function but what about the appendicitis? No problem.

282
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:17,200
-What are your experiences in treating hypertension?

283
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:30,340
-Hypertension has a different etiology if different people.

284
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,980
The etiology is not always the same.

285
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:44,380
We have a hypertension which we call it idiopathic hypertension, that means

286
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:54,230
there is no pathology behind it and it is without reason the hypertension is high.

287
00:32:55,230 --> 00:33:03,430
We have very good results in such cases. Hypertension is a big story.

288
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:11,260
I think it has been misunderstood because who really has hypertension?

289
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:16,260
It is a big question that sometimes is not answered properly by the doctors

290
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:20,760
because you take a blood pressure and it's high...

291
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:27,850
You go to the doctor, you take the blood pressure and it's 170, 180, 190.

292
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:34,550
Is this hypertension? No. It might be because you are stressed at this moment

293
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:37,040
that you're having hypertension.

294
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:47,140
Real hypertensions stays quite high all the time. That can be the result of a stressful life.

295
00:33:48,890 --> 00:34:01,790
Such cases what I have seen is that they are shooting up to 190, 200 back to 170.

296
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:12,730
Then you give them treatment and the whole range comes down from 15 to 18.

297
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:20,460
That is a good result, without any medicine then the organism can tolerate very well

298
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:27,960
that range because there is a different tolerance for each individual in hypertension.

299
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:34,010
I remember a case of an old lady, she came to the office

300
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:37,640
and we measured the blood pressure, it was 250.

301
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:49,100
And usually the blood pressure was 240-270 and she was 78.

302
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:59,380
This woman lived to be 86 with hypertension. We managed to bring it between 23-24.

303
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,630
That was the normal range.

304
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:05,630
She was having some symptoms when it was shooting up to 25,27.

305
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:12,450
She would have numbness, headaches etc. She lived to very old age.

306
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:19,880
I had an aunt that she called me once and I went to see the blood pressure

307
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:39,480
and the manometer went 25,26,27,28,29. It was pumping. I said lie down, no problem.

308
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:46,630
Just lie down. She was terrified and for the last 10 years

309
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:50,260
she had not taken the blood pressure because when she was in a hospital,

310
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:56,550
they took the blood pressure, they say 25,26 and it was a young doctor.

311
00:35:56,650 --> 00:36:01,940
He said my god the other lady last night she had the same blood pressure, she died.

312
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:11,390
From that point she didn't allow anybody to take her blood pressure again.

313
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:16,100
I don't want to know how high blood pressure I have.

314
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:23,630
She was living most probably with 23,24,25 and by the time she was pressed 29.

315
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:29,030
I didn't dare to go further. The pressure was...

316
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:36,430
At 29 she was pumping. So I said lie down and I took some symptoms,

317
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:42,560
I gave some remedy and I normalized the pressure to 22,21,20.

318
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:50,460
Until a year and a half later a doctor comes next door to her neighborhood.

319
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,180
I believe that nobody will take her blood pressure.

320
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:04,930
But she got confident that her blood pressure was not very high,

321
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:13,010
so she asked the cardiologist who comes next door. Why don't you take my blood pressure?

322
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:24,050
He says but it's 21. You have immediately to take the remedies, diuretics etc.

323
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:33,100
And then she calls me after 10-15 days, after taking these drugs and says

324
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,780
I'm not feeling well.

325
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:40,170
Why? What happened? You have to come and see me.

326
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:44,180
I said OK I come and see her and she tells me the story.

327
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:54,680
She is an old woman within 15 days, she is very typical arteriosclerotic woman.

328
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:58,180
She was living happily with 21,22 blood pressure.

329
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:04,040
He thought that it was too high and brought it down to 16 but with 16

330
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:08,900
she was completely paralyzed, like an old woman.

331
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:17,550
Now what can I do? I was afraid to take away the drugs.

332
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:24,130
If I take away the drugs and next day it's up to 29 and she has a brain episode, she dies.

333
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:30,180
She died a year later in that state under allopathic treatment

334
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:34,560
because from 22 it went down to 16.

335
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,950
It was not for her to live in 16.

336
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:42,770
So all these things they have to be taken into consideration.

337
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:53,130
There are other reasons, big arteriosclerosis like this one, what do you expect?

338
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:58,380
The causative factor is different, the result is different.

339
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:09,360
-Do you stop allopathic medicine like beta-blockers, psychopharmaka,

340
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:13,540
psycholeptica when homeopathic  treatment starts?

341
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:28,650
-We do not stop allopathic medicine that can have a fatal effect by stopping them.

342
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:35,650
We are very careful with stopping the drugs and depending on the pathology,

343
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:40,080
which is behind, we may stop or we may not stop.

344
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:47,700
We have different procedures if we don't stop, what we do or if we stop, what we do.

345
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:52,450
What we give together with the remedy if we stop and then we wait for a month

346
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:56,510
before we give another remedy depending on the pathology of the case.

347
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:04,360
Usually unless you are medical doctor, where you know what you are doing,

348
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:15,430
you are not advised to stop drugs which are pertaining to the heart and also cortisone.

349
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:22,680
Because you may have a very problematic case.

350
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:36,430
Severe cases of asthma that they take cortisone, I won't advise you to take up such cases.

351
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:44,410
You are going to have a lot of problems, very long treatment without much effect and

352
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:53,450
finally if you manage to cure one of these cases, it has taken away the possibility for you

353
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:56,540
to treat another 100-200 individuals.

354
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:02,500
Unless you want to do that, you have the energy to really deal every day,

355
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:09,490
to be with that person and to prescribe and to go back to cortisone in case of wrong treatment

356
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:13,240
and then back again to homeopathy, reduce cortisone, bring up treatment.

357
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:19,530
It needs a great muster to do that in Homeopathy.

358
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:27,630
A person who is one year, 1-2 years with cortisone, living with asthma, forget it.

359
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:41,880
-About Dolichos picture. What is the effect of destruction or occupation?

360
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:48,980
Is there a modality? Does it make it better when the patient is occupied or destructed?

361
00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:01,930
-If you are talking about itching, during the day itching can be less

362
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:09,020
because you can be diverting your attention. During night it's not possible to do that.

363
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:14,870
During night all the person is there with itching and he cannot escape from that.

364
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:24,400
Never mind what you try to do the itching is so severe in the night that it will overtake you.

365
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:33,090
-What is your opinion about the Volt electro homeopathy,

366
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:37,950
measuring homeopathic remedies through meridian tests?

367
00:42:51,700 --> 00:43:00,930
-Well, it depends. Different people who are using that machine do claim different things.

368
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:09,090
I have told to these people if you claim this would you show this to me.

369
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:14,160
And nobody ever has come and said OK, we have a case, we'll take the case,

370
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:17,910
the Volt machine will show what is the remedy and I will take the case

371
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:23,690
and I will see what is the remedy, whether they are together, then I will see something is there.

372
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:30,530
Usually what these people do, especially in America, it's they have this machine,

373
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:38,080
they tell the patient to hold the vial and the machine says this is good for you, take it.

374
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:43,170
Another one, this is also good for you, take this and that is also good for you, take this.

375
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:50,160
And the person lives with 20 or 30 vials which are good for him through the Volt machine.

376
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:55,420
I don't understand that, it's something beyond my logic, my comprehension.

377
00:43:57,290 --> 00:44:04,450
How 20 remedies can be good for this man? Maybe one out of these 20 is right

378
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:09,800
but I do believe that if it is right it is by chance and not by the Volt machine.

379
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:23,510
Some people they say we can actually detect whether this is a Pulsatilla 10M with that machine.

380
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:31,860
I say can you do that? OK. Then I will make 10 packages of Pulsatilla.

381
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:38,370
I will make 1 Pulsatilla 10M and 9 packages of nothing, sugar.

382
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:44,120
Find me which is the Pulsatilla and if you find it I will be bound to say great

383
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:47,460
and that machine I will learn it myself.

384
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:55,840
But nobody has ever come and really challenged in this respect.

385
00:44:55,940 --> 00:45:01,080
So I hear stories where they are using perhaps homeopathic remedies

386
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:06,340
but according to my understanding this is not Homeopathy. It is something else.

387
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,010
Voltopathy you can call it.

388
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:20,510
-How to choose a potency of medicine?

389
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:29,050
-How many more questions?
-About 120.

390
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:36,950
-How to choose a potency is a seminar by itself because you have rules,

391
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:39,950
regulations how to choose the potency.

392
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:47,600
I'm not able to say anything of substance at this moment because the subject is too big.

393
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:56,250
-Can homeopathic treatment be combined with Acupuncture treatment?

394
00:45:56,350 --> 00:45:58,630
What is your experience on that?

395
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:06,380
-Not together, they should not be combined together. That means not at the same time.

396
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:11,030
But if you fail with Homeopathy, you can apply Acupuncture.

397
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:14,830
If you fail with Acupuncture, you can apply Homeopathy.

398
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:21,670
If you benefit your patient a little bit with Homeopathy, you may complete this benefit

399
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:29,000
by Acupuncture, that I understand. But to apply them together I don't understand

400
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:33,490
because we have to know what we are doing when we give the remedy.

401
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:37,110
And how do we know if it is from the remedy or the Acupuncture effect

402
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:39,770
and how to proceed further.

403
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:46,910
I'm interested to see if somebody I have taken as a patient, after 10 years

404
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:54,370
he is better than he was before. That is something that Homeopathy can do.

405
00:46:54,470 --> 00:47:01,870
It can make the person better and better and better and this is a scientific process.

406
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:07,360
This has done with this remedy and then you proceed this is the following remedy

407
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:10,080
that he needs now.

408
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:15,670
Shall we go into another group where he is falling, what is the miasmatic condition

409
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:18,700
which is appearing now? Is it something else?

410
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,030
There are so many questions to be solved in the process.

411
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:29,130
How can you do this if you are mixing all the time 2 or 3 different therapies?

412
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:41,280
-How is it possible that I potentise remedies which work on an energetic level,

413
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:47,630
can be antidoted by material things as peppermint, coffee even after several months?

414
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:58,280
-Legitimate question but don't forget that if you drink strong coffee

415
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:00,880
it will give you a lot of energy.

416
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:08,280
If you drink strong coffee for 15, 20 minutes you may have a lot of energy.

417
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:12,280
How does coffee changes the energy level? Of course it changes the energy level and

418
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:16,790
affects definitely the energy and every chemical we put into the body

419
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:25,840
affects the energy level on which is lying the defense mechanism really.

420
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:32,120
Behind the immune system, the reticulo-endothelial system,

421
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:40,410
behind the neurovegetative system, which is called the sympathetic and parasympathetic system,

422
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:50,250
which we all know this is the defense system of the body, lies an intelligence

423
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:56,990
which gives order to each one of them what to do and when to do it.

424
00:48:57,090 --> 00:49:04,250
In that energy level we are dealing in Homeopathy high potencies.

425
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:09,330
But anything that comes to the physical body will affect that energy level as well.

426
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:19,360
Even the most physical blow, that you can receive a physical blow, the energy can drop

427
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:28,460
down like that because the organism says drop down quickly. Faint, no energy at all.

428
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:41,020
Here we have the 3 levels, which are all connected

429
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:47,210
with what we call the defense mechanism or the vital force.

430
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:59,620
Any stimulation on the mental level or the emotional level or the physical level

431
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:09,740
will pass through the vital force that rearranges how the defense should be.

432
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:18,980
And the defense says you stimulate here with coffee, the defense says

433
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:23,080
increase the pulse rate on the physical.

434
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:31,620
Increase the pulse rate on the physical but the increase of energy as well must take place.

435
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:42,660
Not only that but emotionally you feel an elation and mentally you have a more clear mind.

436
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:51,890
So actually the coffee affects mental, emotional and physical level for a time,

437
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:54,500
let's say 20 minutes or half an hour.

438
00:50:55,960 --> 00:51:02,190
After this half an hour, after this initial primary reaction, we have the secondary reaction

439
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:06,280
of the coffee where we have exactly the depression.

440
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:27,300
It is like a pendulum. Here the organism is in balance.

441
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:33,590
Then coffee comes and stimulates. How much it stimulates, it is 30 degrees.

442
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:43,500
Then in order to find balance the depression will be equal, 30 degrees exactly the opposite.

443
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:48,580
And then eventually it will find this position of balance after the effect of the coffee is over.

444
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:59,660
In this process everything takes place including primarily the vital force

445
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,230
or the energy level of the body.

446
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:10,130
Here is the defense mechanism really, here is the central intelligence that gives order of

447
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:14,170
what and exactly how it must happen.

448
00:52:32,930 --> 00:52:38,830
-Would you treat a woman taking birth control pills or having a spiral in the uterus

449
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:41,510
for birth control?

450
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:51,710
-The birth control pills can affect the homeopathic treatment and can be stopping

451
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:53,540
the homeopathic treatment.

452
00:52:53,640 --> 00:53:01,540
The IUV does not matter so much unless the woman is sensitive to this device,

453
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:07,540
in which case she will have constant irritation in the uterus and constant inflammations

454
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:11,830
with the resulting symptomatology.

455
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:16,230
In such a case when she is so sensitive, then she has to take it away.

456
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:20,310
But if she is not sensitive, there is no problem, you can treat.

457
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:31,000
-In Germany they often say dead teeth are blockage and they have to be pulled out

458
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:35,350
so that the remedy can work. Do you have any experience on that?

459
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:42,310
-No I have not seen that, that a dead teeth can be a blockage.

460
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:54,710
-There are some questions on birth pregnancy and early childhood.

461
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:59,210
Do you think that it is wise to prescribe rubella for pregnant women

462
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:06,810
who don't have enough antibodies?
-No I don't know this practice.

463
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:16,540
-Is it possible to cure a miasma in utero . If so, can you say exactly

464
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:19,290
what miasma the baby has?

465
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:24,540
Can you give a nosode when the symptoms do not agree with those of the mother?

466
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:29,230
Is it perhaps advisable to cure the mother symptoms only?

467
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:35,670
-The moment that the woman is pregnant and the fetus is in the uterus,

468
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:39,010
you do not separate between the fetus and the mother.

469
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,960
You only treat the mother and through the mother...

470
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:45,210
It's one thing up to the time of birth.

471
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:50,560
You treat the mother and by treating the mother correctly, you treat the fetus.

472
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:52,620
There is no question about that.

473
00:54:55,310 --> 00:55:01,810
I would say that all pregnant women should have good constitutional homeopathic treatment.

474
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:08,780
It is a must for pregnant women because definitely it's going to be

475
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:13,670
an improvement in the children.

476
00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:21,570
We are exactly in the opposite position with allopathic medicine,

477
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:26,570
where the pregnant woman should not touch allopathic medicine, as much as possible.

478
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:36,070
On the contrary she must have homeopathic treatment, even when she has little symptoms.

479
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:39,820
A good homeopathic treatment from a good homeopath, constitutional, just one remedy,

480
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:45,170
wait and see what happens,  improving the health, is improving of the child definitely.

481
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,570
-There are many questions about vaccinations.

482
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:59,860
Do you have a lot of experience with the prophylaxis of polio and has this always worked,

483
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:05,420
even after a few generations that are vaccinated in the allopathic way?

484
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:11,570
In a case where a grandmother has had polio, will the grand child be more susceptible?

485
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:15,320
Would you treat that child differently with homeo-prophylaxis?

486
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:20,920
And other questions with treatment of Thuja, Pyrogenium and other vaccinations.

487
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:35,320
-Lathyrus for polio vaccinaton...No, I do not have experience

488
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:41,180
in giving homeopathic remedies for prophylaxis.

489
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:45,680
We don't do it.

490
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:53,850
-You showed us a child who was ill in all the plans.

491
00:56:53,950 --> 00:57:04,910
Now, sometimes we give a remedy for a human being who is still on his second plan,

492
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:17,040
in the emotional sphere and the remedy is very chosen and finally a cancer comes up.

493
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:30,190
A cancer disease, let's say in the rectum, and I would like to have a few explanation

494
00:57:30,290 --> 00:57:38,840
how this happens and how we should make evaluation of something like that.

495
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:43,340
Because it's not only once.

496
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:46,990
-You mean in a child?

497
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:58,570
-Not in a child, in a person that you cure on the emotional plane

498
00:57:58,670 --> 00:58:10,920
and suddenly it goes ill on the physical plane but in very serious illness.

499
00:58:12,430 --> 00:58:20,820
-Yes, when the disturbance is on mental-emotional level and the general health

500
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:28,330
of the case is quite low, it might be possible by the disease coming

501
00:58:28,430 --> 00:58:35,070
and focus in the physical body, it produces and analogous state of affair.

502
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:39,830
That means the disease that was on a mental-emotional level like schizophrenia,

503
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:47,660
like manic impressive cases, like paranoic cases, these cases as they are treated

504
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,160
and they are becoming clear in mental-emotional level,

505
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:56,090
they may develop serious physical problems.

506
00:59:06,590 --> 00:59:13,520
Usually in such a case if you continue with the right way the treatment,

507
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:19,680
usually you can save the patient. You can cure this kind of cancer.

508
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:48,350
-LM potencies or higher as you repeat for the physical disease?

509
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:54,380
-You can go quite high.

510
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:06,130
I don't know if you heard a case of mine that I had with a metastasis of the brain?

511
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:16,370
Somebody who came with a cancer of the lungs metastasized in the brain

512
01:00:16,470 --> 01:00:21,520
he came from America and I prescribed Tuberculinum 10M.

513
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:34,000
That case had a beautiful reaction. It was the last stage where we saw the metastasis

514
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:38,030
in the brain and the metastasis on the bones, where definitely reduced,

515
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:45,880
the pains were gone completely and the lesion grew bigger.

516
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:54,080
The force of the disease again came out from the brain,

517
01:00:54,180 --> 01:01:00,940
which was very fast progressing and went back into the lungs.

518
01:01:02,430 --> 01:01:08,330
If you remember this case, I do not know what you would have happened...

519
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:18,580
He flew to Athens from America and then due to connections he had with the hospital

520
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:30,170
in Tokyo, he was the owner of a big Tokyo hospital and the general director came over.

521
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:35,700
Eventually while he was doing very well, he took him over to Japan, put him in the hospital

522
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:39,410
and we were on the line with his physician who was there.

523
01:01:39,510 --> 01:01:47,450
Finally the American physician who was following him to Tokyo said to me

524
01:01:47,550 --> 01:01:55,920
that the Japanese doctors they wanted to give chemotherapy

525
01:01:56,020 --> 01:02:06,660
because the lesion here was growing, the cancer on the lungs was growing

526
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:10,760
but at the same time the person was feeling quite good.

527
01:02:12,510 --> 01:02:19,160
I said I don't agree but he said they insist and they believe that if they do give,

528
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:23,020
the person will get cured.

529
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:26,370
If you hear that story you cannot say anymore...

530
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:31,770
So I said OK they can proceed.

531
01:02:31,870 --> 01:02:36,880
They gave slight chemotherapy together with some antigens,

532
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:41,280
in order to produce some reaction, fever reaction.

533
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:48,120
Immediately the case relapsed and in one month he died.

534
01:02:51,150 --> 01:02:54,650
And I have seen this again and again and again.

535
01:02:55,400 --> 01:03:03,810
I have never been able to see any kind, when Homeopathy was in contrast

536
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:11,600
with some other therapy, I said OK this man is not doing enough progress,

537
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:17,890
why not try this allopathic formula.

538
01:03:17,990 --> 01:03:27,560
I have never seen improvement but I have seen most of the times a regression.

539
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:43,150
You may say you are an expert of Homeopathy, you are not going to say otherwise. No.

540
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:53,020
I have seen cases where Homeopathy could not help but in what case?

541
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:59,770
In a case of pneumonia where it is not Homeopathy that cannot help, it is the remedy

542
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:06,850
that you are giving or I'm giving is not the correct one and the person is not getting better.

543
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:09,200
That's not the fault of Homeopathy.

544
01:04:10,450 --> 01:04:14,350
This is the fault of me that I don't apply correct Homeopathy.

545
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:21,100
In that case I am obliged to give antibiotics. I'm not going to say no, no.

546
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:28,880
I will show you a case of double pneumonia we had in America and I believe this case

547
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:37,180
might be here. Double pneumonia, an X-ray.

548
01:04:40,170 --> 01:04:43,830
She has been given different remedies. She has been given Phosphorus,

549
01:04:43,930 --> 01:04:47,120
she has been given Kali carbonicum, Kali sulphuricum etc.

550
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:49,570
The person was going from bad to worse.

551
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:56,160
When she came to me she was in the last stage. I was not going to wait.

552
01:04:56,260 --> 01:05:00,160
I said this case is Pulsatilla.

553
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:12,010
So you give Pulsatilla 50M but by tomorrow if the fever is not down, hospital.

554
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:19,710
Next day the fever was down, next evening the fever went up again.

555
01:05:19,810 --> 01:05:28,040
Again CM was given 10M, 50M, CM and since that time fever dropped.

556
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:40,290
When we had the follow up 20 days ago she was much better and there was no question

557
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:43,040
of pneumonia anymore.

558
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:49,700
In this case if the reaction was not immediate, that means I could not find the remedy,

559
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:53,450
I would resort to antibiotics.

560
01:05:53,550 --> 01:06:02,700
But if we knew good Homeopathy, how many antibiotics could be spared,

561
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:08,950
the whole of humanity that is now ingesting tones of antibiotics.

562
01:06:09,050 --> 01:06:20,950
If we could produce good homeopaths in thousands, you can understand the implication

563
01:06:21,050 --> 01:06:23,050
of such a treatment.

564
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:45,300
This is last question.

565
01:06:46,290 --> 01:06:55,290
-I was wondering Hahnemann in his early days developed Q potencies and he used them.

566
01:06:56,580 --> 01:07:05,230
The LM potencies, do you use them? When do you use them and what do you see to use

567
01:07:05,330 --> 01:07:07,820
rather than high potencies?

568
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:18,780
-The LM potencies I don't have an experience, I don't use them and so I cannot comment.

569
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:27,530
I got used in using these potencies and I know the results of these potencies.

570
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:35,030
When I treat a case I want to see results.

571
01:07:35,130 --> 01:07:42,280
Because with Homeopathy we say, wait, wait, wait. You are doing well, we'll see.

572
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:48,530
All these potencies will act as long as the remedy is correct.

573
01:07:48,630 --> 01:07:58,480
They will act much more slowly. I believe they will act.

574
01:07:58,580 --> 01:08:05,730
Also don't forget that the cases we see today are mostly mental-emotional cases.

575
01:08:05,830 --> 01:08:11,480
There is such tremendous suffering in mental-emotional level that cannot be touched

576
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:19,780
to my understanding by very low potencies. There are some cases in which I go low.

577
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:27,110
But not LM. I will go 12X or 6X but not LM. I do not have the experience.

578
01:08:27,210 --> 01:08:30,940
I'm not against LM. Don't get it wrong.

579
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:35,830
I say that the experience I have is with these potencies.

580
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:42,280
-I have a question concerning cancer.

581
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:48,650
Over the total population I see a tremendous increase in the rate of cancers.

582
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:57,440
In future, a homeopath will be confronted with breast cancers even in young children.

583
01:08:57,540 --> 01:09:03,940
Would you recommend still trying to treat these children with the risk of breast cancer

584
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:09,380
coming out again? What's your feeling about it?

585
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:21,230
-The only way that they may suppress a cancer is by making the person

586
01:09:21,330 --> 01:09:25,380
completely mentally deranged.

587
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:30,880
-In the sense of radiation, chemotherapy?

588
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:36,070
-Once a radiation has been given and chemotherapy I don't feel

589
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:39,070
that we have any chance with Homeopathy.

590
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:46,610
It' very little chance to cure with Homeopathy and most probably in all these cases

591
01:09:46,710 --> 01:09:49,360
there is a natural relapse of the case.

592
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:58,720
The persons may die after a certain period of time, whether you give Homeopathy or not.

593
01:09:59,990 --> 01:10:05,890
-I refer especially to children. There are children who are on the face of death

594
01:10:05,990 --> 01:10:10,290
and they get radiation and later in their life they recover.

595
01:10:11,050 --> 01:10:21,040
-The only case that we can be talking about is cancer of the blood.

596
01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:34,280
In such cases you have definitely possibilities but depending on the type of cancer

597
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:36,110
we are talking...

598
01:10:36,210 --> 01:10:47,700
The squamous cell cancer is a cancer that develops very fast in metastasis, very quickly.

599
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:55,450
In such cases I don't feel we have any chance with Homeopathy or any other system.

600
01:10:55,550 --> 01:11:01,950
But there are some types of cancer which are either slow growing or you can stop them

601
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:08,700
at a certain stage of development. Homeopathy can be useful.

602
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:14,950
I don't want to discuss the question of cancer because I don't want to appear

603
01:11:15,050 --> 01:11:19,900
saying that we are treating cancer, that we are curing cancer.

604
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:27,440
In spite of the fact that the experiences show that with Homeopathy

605
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:34,290
we can have amelioration results.

606
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:42,030
Cancer cases are ameliorated and perhaps they are more ameliorated than if

607
01:11:42,130 --> 01:11:47,630
they have taken allopathic drugs. But we cannot talk about a cure.

608
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:56,030
-In general if a case of cancer has been radiated, you would say don't touch it with Homeopathy.

609
01:11:56,130 --> 01:11:58,380
-I will not take such cases.
