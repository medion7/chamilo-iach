1
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:35,190
-Kent described in (?) if the patient has (?)

2
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:45,540
-So in a case of tuberculosis, tuberculosis in young age, you gave Sulphur.

3
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:51,280
The question is... Did you understand the question?

4
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:06,190
What Kent meant is actually when we have tuberculosis,

5
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:16,050
gonorrhea is dangerous to give Silica or Phosphorus or Sulphur?

6
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:25,290
Because these remedies, say Phosphorus, has the tendency to break up the arteries

7
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,380
and bring up a hemorrhage.

8
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:38,130
The tubercular also has a tendency to break up arteries and bring up hemorrhage.

9
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:46,420
So it may speed up the process but not when you have in the past.

10
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,040
20 years ago, you had tuberculosis and now it is indicated Phosphorus

11
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,140
but you cannot give it. You can give it.

12
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:01,400
Or Silica or Sulphur, there is no danger.

13
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,810
In our experience we found that there is no danger at all,

14
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:11,390
neither to bring up the tuberculosis of the past.

15
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:21,040
What may happen is that if a person was Sulphur in his young age

16
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:31,040
and he went into another remedy and he was Arsenicum and then during that time

17
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:41,830
he had tuberculosis and he needed Sulphur...

18
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:48,060
and tuberculosis and the Sulphur picture went away and Arsenicum came

19
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:59,250
and you give Arsenicum and this layer goes away and the layer of Sulphur appears,

20
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,000
that does not mean that tuberculosis will appear.

21
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:10,130
What it means is that during that stage he had the possibility to get again tuberculosis,

22
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:15,630
that means if he stresses himself, if he does not sleep for certain days,

23
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,880
if he does not eat well, if he goes to over exertion...

24
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:25,970
The predisposition is there for tuberculosis at that state but if you give Sulphur

25
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,300
you take away the predisposition as well.

26
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:39,310
It does not mean that you turn up the tuberculosis per se but that state which admits tuberculosis.

27
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,640
He cannot admit tuberculosis at that level.

28
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:50,140
One of these remedies (?) then he can admit tuberculosis again.

29
00:03:51,970 --> 00:04:00,640
I've seen it in one doctor, where he came for his stomach.

30
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:10,740
He had vomiting and asthma and ulcer and he was given Phosphorus 10M.

31
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:20,630
Then 2-3 years he was doing very well and something happened to the eyes of his child

32
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:27,490
and he took it to the ophalmologist to examine it.

33
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:35,140
So they examined it and either by mistake or by wrong diagnosis, I don't remember now,

34
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,980
he was told that his child was going to be blind.

35
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:52,240
He stopped from work on a hospital for tuberculosis.

36
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:02,130
For 2-3 nights he could not sleep, he was in turmoil that his child was going to be blind.

37
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:10,770
He did not eat, he did not sleep, he had excess work in the hospital.

38
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,480
Within 20 days he came down with tuberculosis.

39
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:26,740
What happened? He took (?) and (?) which is the allopathic drugs for tuberculosis.

40
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:41,220
Eventually he developed some fears, fear of killing his child actually and other fears.

41
00:05:45,020 --> 00:06:03,530
The X-ray shows on the upper point that through allopathic medicine hadn't reduce it

42
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,770
in spite of a few months of treatment with allopathic drugs.

43
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:22,700
I prescribed Sulphur on that state and I think it was Sulphur 30 every week for 5 weeks perhaps.

44
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:29,870
And fears disappeared and the fear went away.

45
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:40,530
In the meantime he was fainting, he was afraid to give out the pus

46
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:44,040
that he had retained for 3 months.

47
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:53,200
(?) under Sulphur, he was continuing with anti-tubercular drug also.

48
00:06:53,300 --> 00:07:00,150
This thing disappeared and what is most important is that the fears went away as well.

49
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:09,340
The other remedies were suppressing that (?) where with Sulphur,

50
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,840
both this and the fears went away and he stopped taking any drug

51
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:18,190
where they usually keep this treatment for one year.

52
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:46,270
-I don't believe this observation of Kent.

53
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:53,140
I don't believe that if you give the right remedy, because in this case I gave him Sulphur.

54
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:00,540
I believe that if it is not so much indicated, it's not exactly and if you give Phosphorus,

55
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,380
you may create hemoptysis.

56
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:10,190
That's the problem. Phosphorus is not indicated, the person is ready to have hemoptysis,

57
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:14,550
you give Phosphorus, then you speed this up.

58
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:24,450
Because Phosphorus acts only on the (?) and breaks them down.

59
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:32,050
So you break it more easily and then you have the hemoptysis.

60
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:53,290
Silica also, it breaks up this, the organism tries to insist, to reduce this.

61
00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:00,190
Silica has the tendency to break up the tumors.

62
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:09,200
So if it is not indicated, it will tend just to break up, instead of helping (?)

63
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:17,300
but if it is indicated even in acute actual tuberculosis.

64
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,790
As long as we are sure, we can give it.

65
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,290
-Who can be sure?

66
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:38,080
-Because the time I was in your position, I was very young in my practice,

67
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:46,630
so I took a case of tuberculosis and I took a dose of 30.

68
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:58,690
Then I go home and I said, what have I done? I could not sleep quite in my house.

69
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:07,000
So I went back because to the home of this man and I said I think I gave the wrong medicine.

70
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:15,100
Give it back to me. And I was afraid to give it.

71
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:24,260
Sulphur is the same.

72
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,510
But I was afraid Sulphur for tuberculosis?

73
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:52,490
It's better to ask the questions here because the more interesting questions are asked outside.

74
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:07,250
So I have to answer and here is one person but here the whole class will have the profit.

75
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:46,850
They have this person and let's suppose that you have to give in the center here the similimum,

76
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,610
then you give other remedies, what do they do?

77
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:59,690
Say, they are sitting here. This is quite far from the similimum, nothing...

78
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:03,380
There nothing, there nothing...

79
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:18,040
But he has a pain on his left arm and you shoot here and this pain is taken away.

80
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:25,690
But because you did not shoot here in the center, that it is replaced by another pain here

81
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,430
or another pain there.

82
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:33,290
Then you shoot again, try to find the similimum, you shoot there, this pain goes away.

83
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:41,440
That pain on the knee and you shoot there and you shoot there...

84
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:48,530
But if you shoot here, here, here, then you may take a lot of remedies.

85
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:54,040
You may take some remedies, which may have some effect, which is local.

86
00:12:54,540 --> 00:13:02,270
But you will not be able go to the center and cure the person from the inside.

87
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:07,520
Especially when we have the psychological amelioration.

88
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:22,780
This is a great, great instrument of measuring health, joy of life.

89
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:28,130
If you see people having joy of life with any pains, better don't give anything.

90
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:45,200
If you have somebody who has a pain here, a pain here...

91
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,940
but you examine the person and psychologically is well and his energy is good

92
00:13:50,040 --> 00:14:00,040
and he is enjoying life, he has joy of life... don't give anything, give placebo.

93
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:13,860
-If you give a remedy which aggravates for a while...

94
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:18,620
-You give a remedy that aggravates for a while or for long term?

95
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,870
-For a few months.

96
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:26,700
-For a few months it aggravates the psychological state without amelioration?

97
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:46,140
That you shouldn't have because it goes towards the center of the human being...

98
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,960
without bringing about a curable reaction.

99
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:05,450
The provers... this person is a Pulsatilla person.

100
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:14,130
Pulsatilla will cure but Calcarea carbonica for this person is here.

101
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,540
So you give Calcarea carbonica.

102
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:23,540
This person also will prove (?) It is here.

103
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:28,540
He cannot prove Sulphur, it is here. He cannot prove Mercury, it is there.

104
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:40,540
The closest the remedy is, the more the effect upon his organism.

105
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:49,030
It needs Pulsatilla, Calcarea carbonica is here.

106
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:57,650
He has fear of insanity, you give Calcarea carbonica and the fear of insanity becomes worse.

107
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:04,150
Plus now the person is putting on weight more easily.

108
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:20,650
Plus that person that goes on warm side, because being Pulstila, now starts from (?). But is not cured.

109
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:32,630
-To close this case you should wait or should get the totality of the symptoms (?)?

110
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:40,140
-The thing is that you can't wait because the patient says I'm this, I'm that...

111
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,990
They complain, so you take your second chance.

112
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,470
-If you have a different remedy and you have very,

113
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:12,970
very strong aggravation of almost all the symptoms, is it possible

114
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:21,460
that you have picked the right remedy that has aggravated that person so much that it is difficult

115
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:28,460
that you see the amelioration on the psychological side?

116
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:38,960
-Yes. The aggravation can take place also on emotional or mental level

117
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:47,770
and it can last for some time and then you are more able to assess

118
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:52,040
whether this is being to have amelioration.

119
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,780
It is best to wait for one and a half month, two months.

120
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:01,530
If you see that the aggravation continues for 2-3 months, then forget it.

121
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,700
It's a close remedy.

122
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:14,360
-I have such a case that for (?) has to do something for him.

123
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:21,860
So I (?) and (?)

124
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:29,600
What happened is that she did (?) to her former state but (?)

125
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:36,370
and disturbed aggravation from (?). I could see some amelioration.

126
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:44,940
-That means that if you waited more, the person would have such signs

127
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:56,290
and would have been better without (?) You will find an amelioration.

128
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:15,290
-You said a single dose of the remedy cannot (?)

129
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:27,800
-(?) and you give it once the month, once the week, once a day and once every hour.

130
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:32,440
Every hour you give one single dose.

131
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:39,590
The way you say it is not very clear, the way I said it is one dose every month.

132
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:49,990
If you say one dose every three hours, that means another dose every three hours in one week,

133
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:55,510
21 remedies. That is going to do harm.

134
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:02,360
But you give one dose and wait the whole month, what happened?

135
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:09,570
You evaluate and because the person is nearly well and needed another remedy (?)

136
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:19,180
But give every day another remedy, it's a bad practice.

137
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:28,830
You give the remedy at the time but you have to give it and see what it does,

138
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:33,920
whether it affected any change and this change you take into consideration.

139
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:40,820
These changes do they indicate another remedy?

140
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:50,170
Sometimes when we feel it's the wrong remedy, it produces a state of the next remedy quite clear.

141
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:58,000
For instance you give Arsenicum and it doesn't actually help the person.

142
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:05,830
He says I'm the same but what we see is changes indicating Sulphur.

143
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:12,070
So you gave Arsenicum and then you have Sulphur, Sulphur, Sulphur.

144
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:22,820
That's very interesting because without Arsenicum you could not see Sulphur.

145
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:32,070
You give Arsenicum, it does not help but produces a new state which indicates Sulphur.

146
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:34,670
You gave Sulphur and then the cure comes.

147
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:42,570
-Also if you keep (?)

148
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:53,420
-No this is not heat (?) It is a paragraph on the Organon...

149
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:02,430
-Arsenicum is a very cool remedy.

150
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:13,840
-The cold person becomes warm. This is the change of Arsenicum.

151
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:19,990
When a person is cold, he cannot take Sulphur, you give Arsenicum, then the person changes,

152
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:23,760
he becomes warm and then he can take Sulphur.

153
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:29,500
Which is the part of the Organon which talks about this case?

154
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:38,250
-One sided cases.
-One sided cases, one of these paragraphs...

155
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:50,990
-67.
-172.

156
00:22:54,740 --> 00:23:03,150
-He gives ideas when you don't have the real picture to give a remedy,

157
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:07,990
then it is best to give (?) and then the real picture will show.

158
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:20,000
-If you make one person cold...
-No.

159
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:29,150
Actually the person to start with (?) which is rather a cold remedy,

160
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:33,000
eventually goes to Calcarea carbonica state...

161
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:40,250
It takes Calc. carbonica and becomes cold and then there is a big change.
