1
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:28,630
-Is it true that you can't repeat Tuberculinum?
-You can repeat Tuberculinum.

2
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:40,800
The only remedy which I would not give every day perhaps is Lachesis.

3
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,950
Even Lachesis for 2-3 months it might be creating some problems.

4
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:57,530
-You just said before that Lachesis is the only remedy that shouldn't be given repeatedly

5
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,900
and I'd like to know why.

6
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:10,040
-Because of some comment by Kent, I have not tried myself really.

7
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,540
Of some comment by Kent who says don't repeat Lachesis.

8
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:28,950
Though I have asked when I was In India. There they repeat. They repeat high potencies.

9
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,690
Then I asked do you also repeat Lachesis? They said yes.

10
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:39,190
I don't know. I have not done it for Lachesis.

11
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:51,860
-I would like to ask you to repeat about Lachesis, how often can one repeat it?

12
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:59,430
-Especially with Lachesis we have to be a little bit more careful than other remedies

13
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:06,670
and we don't repeat unless we are sure that there is a relapse.

14
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:13,040
It is better to wait a little bit more longer, be sure and then you give it, no problem.

15
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:25,680
Otherwise to repeat Lachesis every day, especially when it's not indicated...

16
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:34,030
If you have somebody who does not believe Homeopathy, do it.

17
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:44,740
Give him Lachesis and you write in an envelop what is going to happen to him.

18
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:52,560
-Mr Vithoulkas about Tuberculinum as well.

19
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:58,320
I'd like to ask, this is a two year old girl who was given Tuberculinum 30 for eczema

20
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,060
and she did very well.

21
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:06,810
After one month she gets vomiting diarrhea for about 4 days and then it was decided to treat.

22
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:11,320
She was given Arsenicum which helped immediately and after Arsenicum

23
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,330
the Tuberculinum came back immediately.

24
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:19,560
She was then given another 30, a repetition and she got a prolonged

25
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,310
and severe aggravation from that Tuberculinum.

26
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:29,410
She was then given the LM potency Tuberculinum, which brings the eczema down

27
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:35,150
but it seems that whenever the LM potencies are stopped, she gets the eczema back.

28
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,420
Could you please explain what is happening?

29
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:46,570
-After you gave Tuberculinum 30 the second time, she had a big reaction?

30
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,320
-Yes.

31
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:53,080
-Then you gave what potency?
-LM 1, Q1.

32
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,990
-And with LM1 what was the effect?

33
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:06,040
-The eczema gets better but whenever the LM is stopped, the eczema becomes worse again.

34
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:16,170
I would like to know after the acute why was such a severe reaction to the same potency as before?

35
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:28,080
-It would mean that the acute brought a little bit more down the organism than before.

36
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:36,200
The acute was quite severe, brought the organism down and that's why she got this strong reaction.

37
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,400
I would suggest at this case to give Tuberculinum 200.

38
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,670
-OK, thank you.

39
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:56,880
-I have a 35 years old patient. She had an aneurism which broke and she had a hemorrhage.

40
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:03,810
She completely recovered but what remains is strong pains in her left arm and left leg.

41
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,650
I gave her Arnica C200.

42
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:16,800
She reacted on this with a terrible headache, which she had then

43
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,480
at the very beginning of this event.

44
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:34,570
For one week she was so well that we thought it's all over but then she got a relapse.

45
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:45,310
But I'm afraid to give a higher potency because I'm scared that something could happen.

46
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:53,880
-In that case because of the previous episode, the cerebral episode,

47
00:05:53,980 --> 00:06:01,630
I would be careful to examine why she has the pain. What is the pathology underlined that pain.

48
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:09,640
If the pathology underlined the pain is gross pathology, I would not give higher potency.

49
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:16,250
If nothing can be found and it is a rheumatic pain...

50
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:23,080
What is this? It is a pain in the arm? In upper arm.

51
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:36,630
-As she describes, it is inside and she describes this pain like burning metal pain

52
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:52,260
and cold pain. If in winter we touch a metal, it's burning for us.

53
00:06:54,710 --> 00:07:04,720
-The way that you describe it, it's deep inside.
-Yes.

54
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:09,080
-It's not connected with the heart?
-No.

55
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:29,820
-Try Rhus tox. Try 30 first, give a few doses and if it improves, stop.

56
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:36,550
I would be careful in her case repeating Arnica.

57
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:44,290
-I have a very severe case of asthma. She is taking a cortisone spray

58
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:47,370
and she is very bad or she is very weak.

59
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:52,340
I would like to know what to do because the only symptom is that the asthma is getting worse,

60
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,150
as soon as she stops the cortisone.

61
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:11,390
I'd like to know how to deal with such a case because I think it's difficult to stop the cortisone.

62
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:21,130
-What is the pathology of the asthma? She has an emphysema?

63
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:26,970
The lungs have stopped functioning?

64
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:40,140
-I don't think it's that far. She is too very depressive but the asthma is getting very bad

65
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,710
when she stops taking this spray.

66
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:53,560
But in the situation with the cortisone, I don't get any clear symptoms.

67
00:08:54,310 --> 00:09:00,810
-That's true. The main symptom for her is exhaustion?

68
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,900
-Yes.

69
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,200
-You can try Stannum but you have to repeat it twice or 3 times the day.

70
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,880
Stannum 30, three times the day, together with the cortisone and then try

71
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:22,970
after a week to reduce the cortisone to see if there is any effect.

72
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:31,450
I would think Stannum and Bryonia, try first the one, then the other, see what happens.

73
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:44,880
-You said that in children if repeated vomiting the first remedy to think is Ipecacuanha.

74
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,400
-Yes.

75
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,800
-In the case of my son, he is 12 years.

76
00:09:49,900 --> 00:10:07,290
He had a very strong hypothyroidism  after grief and after some month he got Natrum muriaticum

77
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:11,030
and hypothyroidism  went away.

78
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:18,290
And now after this he is always vomiting very short and very frequent

79
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:23,980
and he is very chilly and also fastidious.

80
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,680
In this case would you also think as the first remedy, Ipecanuanha?

81
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,540
-Yes.

82
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:49,100
-Concerning our diabetic child, is it possible that even if we find the correct remedy

83
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:55,870
and give it and the pathology aggravates in spite of that, that this is an incurable case?

84
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:07,130
-If the pathology is really serious and you give a remedy and you see an aggravation,

85
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:21,420
you always suspect that this aggravation may go on and on and not that it is the end.

86
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:30,180
That means the patient will die but you have to do something, to stop this by the next remedy.

87
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:38,720
When the pathology is strong, like the boy that has juvenile diabetes...

88
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:50,690
This I want to know if his mother has given us today how is the boy?

89
00:11:55,690 --> 00:12:04,670
Can you call her? Call her. Just to give you a report after the Carcinosin.

90
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:17,670
-I would like to ask about a case. She has headaches since 10 years,

91
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:29,930
severe migraines that begin from the occiput and neck going towards the left forehead.

92
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:39,870
She has no modalities only that she needs to lie down quiet and she has to vomit.

93
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:50,190
There is no aura before the headaches. I have tried Iris but it didn't help.

94
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,940
What are the main remedies?

95
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,840
-The main remedies can be different remedies.

96
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:04,350
But if she has to vomit and vomiting ameliorates, try Sanguinaria.

97
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,720
In spite of the fact Sanguinaria is more on the right side, try Sanguinaria.

98
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:16,260
-My question is concerning the layers you have been talking about.

99
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,760
For example I have 4 layers on top of each other and I take one by one away

100
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,860
with the correct remedy.

101
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:30,350
You said that it is not possible that the organism falls back in one of the layers before.

102
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:38,090
In Elisa's case we saw that we start with Nat mur, then after Nat mur

103
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:44,080
we gave 2-3 correct prescribed remedies...

104
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,940
-We gave Arsenicum and then Nitric acid.

105
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:59,680
-Afterwards she again received Nat mur. Can you please tell me how to understand this?

106
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:10,190
While she was in Germany she faxed you and you told her to take Nat mur in February.

107
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:15,100
My question is even though I'm taking away layer by layer correctly,

108
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:20,450
how is it possible that I come back to a certain point where I started with.

109
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:28,560
-First I want to ask why she asked me for a remedy by fax?

110
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,040
Because I can't remember all these things.

111
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:40,780
If you think that I have on my mind everything, the names etc.

112
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:46,420
One name and then I have the symtpoms, I say to my secretary prescribe.

113
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:50,080
I read very fast, what do you think?

114
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:56,190
Now you ask me why 2 years ago I prescribed Nat mur? I don't know.

115
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:01,580
-I understand that you can't memorize everything by heart completely.

116
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,080
I just want to fill you in.

117
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:08,340
I sent you a fax in February, 6 months I had had persisting  headaches,

118
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:13,760
20 days per month and panic attacks for which you have given me Arsenicum

119
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,030
and which they had ameliorated in the beginning.

120
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:19,610
They were aggravated again and happened twice the week.

121
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:25,500
The fax I sent you was very long and very precise and Nat mur

122
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:31,100
which you prescribed for me in C200 took away the panic attacks.

123
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:36,610
I assume you gave it to me for these panic attacks. That's why you prescribed that.

124
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:40,380
I had written that my fear was that these panic attacks

125
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,450
could ressemble something like an aura before an epileptic fit.

126
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,590
It helped me very well for the panic attacks, it didn't help me for the headaches,

127
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:51,440
so I hope we can do something here.

128
00:15:51,950 --> 00:16:02,550
-This is a case of partial action. I could not remember which was the case.

129
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:09,050
I saw this fax, it was very dramatic and most probably I said to my secretary,

130
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:12,820
I saw the picture there.

131
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:18,970
It is not possible for me if I don't know what is exactly the case.

132
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:26,470
I have to go and look for 5 hours the case to decide, is it possible?

133
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:30,560
Therefore it was a mistake.
-No.

134
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:37,050
-Of course, it's a partial action. Actually what was needed was Lac caninum.

135
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:41,570
This is the right remedy, that's it.

136
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:51,300
It's a partial action of a remedy, it is not the correct remedy.

137
00:16:52,900 --> 00:17:01,140
You give remedies and you see he is getting better on this or that.

138
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:06,630
This is partial action of the remedy, not the correct remedy.

139
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:14,390
The correct remedy has to open up the case in such a way as to make a clearer picture next time.

140
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:20,140
That was a mistake and by chance it acted partially.

141
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,320
What it did for the headaches? Nothing.

142
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:28,990
The headaches remained all the same.

143
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,240
-I have a patient, she is 50 years old.

144
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:42,990
She has a spastic paralysis since she was 2 years old , which was probably caused by vaccination.

145
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:50,890
She is now coming because of climacterium [menopausal] complaints.

146
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:55,810
To which amount can I influence this spastic paralysis

147
00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:00,660
and how it can affect the problems she has in the menopause?

148
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:07,410
-This spastic paralysis you can influence from very little to little.

149
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:15,390
The menopausal premenstrual syndrome you can influence quite a lot.

150
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:23,770
But the spastic paralysis is like having a damage, like you miss one leg.

151
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:32,930
-My question is that if we have 2 remedies in a case like a patient  is already on the remedy

152
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:37,590
and then you prescribe another one for an acute condition

153
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:41,600
and the patient is better. For example, let's say Stannum helps my mother.

154
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:47,380
How soon I go back to Lilium tigrinum? Do I go immediately?

155
00:18:47,480 --> 00:19:00,740
-As soon as the exhaustion leaves and this peculiar cough ameliorated is going out, start again.

156
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:06,620
But if she stays better, wait, don't do anything.

157
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:16,050
Your mother's case is also incurable. So we have to keep her stimulated

158
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:19,360
and keep her the best possible way.

159
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,830
-I have 2 questions.

160
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:36,730
The first one, if in the repertorization comes up Opium and the patient has diarrhea

161
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:42,430
immediately after eating, can I give him Opium?

162
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,650
-You can give him Opium yes.

163
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:52,890
-The second question. I have a patient 9 years old who had tumor to the brain.

164
00:19:52,990 --> 00:20:02,900
He was operated 1 1/2 years ago and I gave him Carcinosin 200, one dose.

165
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,250
After 9 months the tumor disappeared.

166
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,150
-But you said he was operated.

167
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:18,900
-Yes but they left the tumor there because it was a bulb and when they wanted to take it out,

168
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:28,660
he may stop respiratory and the heart. And they left the tumor there.

169
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,150
After 9 months the tumor disappeared.

170
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:38,080
That means the tumor can appear in other place?
-It may yes.

171
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:42,250
-Or it is cured?
-Maybe it is cured.

172
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:50,670
-They said it is cancer.
-What kind of cancer?

173
00:20:50,770 --> 00:21:06,440
-I don't know, they didn't want to tell. They give him one month to live and he lives 1 1/2 year.

174
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:22,010
-These are sometimes happening and I say that boy may belong to this group.

175
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,100
Once they belong to this group and they are operated

176
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:36,070
and they take chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the level goes down here.

177
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:42,920
Sometimes it happens. I hope it won't relapse.

178
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:46,560
There is a possibility for a relapse of course, there is a possibility

179
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:52,320
of developing somewhere else the cancer, there is a possibility that one day

180
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:57,170
you may find it's diffused the cancer.

181
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:06,840
But still it's better than having followed the orthodox treatment.

182
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:15,730
-I have a 70 years old patient with many symtpoms of Argentum nitricum.

183
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:19,230
For the last 4 months he has said a very peculiar symptom.

184
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:26,630
His right side of his body is very sensitive to cold or heat, he feels pain like needles

185
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:31,630
and only in the right side of his body with heat or cold.

186
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:39,730
Could this belong still to Argentum nitricum or to some other remedy?

187
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:50,130
-This is a symptom, when the one side of the body is behaving different than the other,

188
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:56,440
it's a symptom of Causticum. So you investigate Causticum in this case.

189
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:04,880
If this person is desiring sweets and is hot, forget Causticum.

190
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:11,390
If he is cold and not desire sweets, most probably he is a Causticum case

191
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:16,730
but it needs more investigation. It is not enough that symptom to prescribe.

192
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:26,130
-I have a question to the levels. You said that 4th level they don't get acutes...

193
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,480
-Mild acutes.

194
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:38,230
-And in 1st level, people who stay in 1st level all their life they don't get many acutes.

195
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:44,630
-From time to time they will get an acute and this acute can be with high fever,

196
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:48,380
strong reaction, they get over it. No danger.

197
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,290
-You can only differentiate because one person has a disease

198
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:56,470
and the other person doesn't have a disease. Or how can you differentiate?

199
00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:00,470
You say you don't get acutes, that's no good.

200
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:07,620
But for example my mother never had an acute all her life, she is 89.

201
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:13,890
-She belongs to the first group where you don't get acutes or very little acutes.

202
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:26,460
If you get acutes twice the year, a flu and suddenly one year you don't have a flu,

203
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,550
that is a bad sign.

204
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:39,380
Unless you have become really very healthy, that means you have taken the correct remedy.

205
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:45,890
Unless this is happening, this is not a good sign to have.

206
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:55,550
Where in a situation where you say I stayed under the rain, I got wet, still nothing happened.

207
00:24:55,650 --> 00:25:01,540
Where in another case I would have been in bed, that is not a good sign,

208
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:10,140
unless previously you have taken your remedy which supposed to be the correct remedy.

209
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:16,550
But if for some time you did not have this acute and suddenly you take your remedy

210
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:20,900
and then you develop this acute again, this is a very good sign.

211
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:34,150
-I would like to ask again about the acute. I didn't understand exactly what it means acute.

212
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:42,910
There are some times that you can get something like a flu which takes one day to finish.

213
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:45,980
The next day is gone.

214
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:52,710
-That's an acute. It's an acute but what we call a mild acute.

215
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:57,460
-I found out that many people after taking remedies have this kind of acute.

216
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,650
It doesn't develop to a strong one.

217
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,800
-Don't take it generally.

218
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:11,060
Each individual has to be evaluated according to his past, what she was getting

219
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,240
and what she is getting now.

220
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:18,060
The comparison is that makes the evaluation correct.

221
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:25,710
-No, I'm talking about people who used to be strong ones and after the remedy

222
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:29,480
they start to have this kind of episodes.

223
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:38,930
-If they have stronger acutes, they had acutes but mild, now they have strong acutes,

224
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:47,230
it's a good sign but at the same time showing that the level of pathology was quite deep.

225
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:55,290
Because for years they were getting mild acutes. I get a cold but it is mild.

226
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,980
I don't know what exactly happened.

227
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:06,460
We can have some research to find out why this is happening but definitely

228
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:23,700
when you go into stage where the pathology is quite serious, the acute subside in general.

229
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,890
As a general idea.

230
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:33,370
Now if the acutes after the treatment start reappearing it's a very good sign.

231
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:38,480
Then I said what you have to do, treat or not treat.

232
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:43,540
-But if it's the other way around, a person used to have an acute strong ones

233
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:52,790
and more frequent ones and then the remedy is taken and then the acute comes and stops.

234
00:27:52,890 --> 00:28:01,450
-That's a good sign, showing that the person is not down here, it's on the second group

235
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:07,960
and the remedy is correct and it's minimizing the acutes.

236
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:15,620
-When you explained this morning about being in the first two and having an acute

237
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:21,130
it's not a good sign, if you have it immediately. On the other hand...

238
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:29,280
-I said immediately, if you have immediately an acute it's not a good sign

239
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:35,880
unless the acute was prepared before even the remedy.

240
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:41,290
If the acute was prepared, the organism has a prodromal period for the acute.

241
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:45,530
Always an acute has a prodromal period.

242
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:51,290
Some acutes have one day or two days, then you take the remedy

243
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:54,790
and the next day you develop an acute.

244
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:58,780
-So how you would know? If the person said he felt good before?

245
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:05,290
-You don't know immediately what that means. You will know in the future.

246
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:11,530
Because if you go over the acute easily most probably the remedy is correct.

247
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:19,280
The problem is that the remedy has exhausted more its action counteracting the acute

248
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:24,540
and maybe a relapse will take place within the next few months.

249
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,700
But it shows that the remedy was correct.

250
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:37,960
But if the acute is very strong and you are in these groups,

251
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:42,800
that shows the remedy was doing nothing.

252
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:55,940
-Years ago I treated very badly behaving youngster.

253
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,690
-Personality disorder.

254
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:06,790
-Yes, very deep personality disorder. More than 4 years ago.

255
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:14,440
I treated him with Syphilinum and I repeated the dose too early

256
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:22,190
and then he turned very aggressive towards a person, he raped an old lady.

257
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:27,440
Does that have to do with the remedy I gave him? I could never make up my mind.

258
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:34,040
That was the reason he was raping the lady?
-No I don't think.

259
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:50,050
-It was wrong remedy, I know it now.
-Personality disorders are deep disorders.

260
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:57,190
Don't think they are simple things because we call them personality.

261
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:02,690
Because there are people who live in the society and they have these disorders

262
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:06,290
and nobody takes much notice of them.

263
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:17,690
But like the man in England who took the gun and killed several children

264
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:24,950
and his behavior so far supposed to be proper.

265
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:32,550
And one day he just took a gun and killed the whole class of his own students.

266
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:40,530
Nobody paid attention to him, he was a bit strange. That's all.

267
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:47,520
These kind of disorders are very difficult to treat and when you treat you will see

268
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:55,950
that you need a lot of different remedies and slowly you will get what I call acutes.

269
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:05,340
And then even you treat the acutes, still difficult to bring around this person

270
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,200
and make him a healthy individual.

271
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:28,020
-You consider the vitamin and minerals as a suppression in Homeopathy point of view?

272
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:37,190
-No, you can take vitamins, you can take minerals. It's like better food,

273
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:45,410
it can't cause a suppression unless, like this woman who was here from Australia,

274
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:54,090
you take this kind of not milligrams but grams,

275
00:32:56,030 --> 00:33:04,280
30 grams of vitamin, this I'm very skeptical.

276
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:11,740
-Is there a remedy that has amelioration during pregnancy? I have a patient,

277
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:17,260
she has two children, during both pregnancies she didn't change anything else in her life.

278
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:22,420
She continued working and so on and all her symptoms, she had a severe migraine etc.

279
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,770
everything was ameliorated during pregnancy.

280
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,260
-She is a phenomenon because many times the organism

281
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:36,360
due to the change of the hormones becomes balanced.

282
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:49,670
It's like a homeopathic remedy. Then she is healthy. No remedy during that pregnancy.

283
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:51,420
You don't need to give a remedy.

284
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:55,410
You give a remedy afterwards if she falls back and you see the changes.

285
00:33:55,510 --> 00:34:02,590
I was not like this and now I'm irritable. You take all the symptoms and you prescribe.

286
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:11,190
Maybe you reorganize her hormonal system.

287
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:18,330
-I have two questions. The first one concerns the acute prescription in children.

288
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:25,330
You have said if a child vomits immediately after eating, then it's Ferrum metallicum.

289
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:32,690
Does this also count for new borns and infants when they vomit after being breast fed?

290
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:45,340
-No I don't think. When the infant vomits, especially if it comes out as a piece,

291
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:54,680
the milk does not come as liquid but in little pieces, then it's Aethusa.

292
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:13,340
Maybe Lac defloratum, Natrum carbonicum also but the first remedy Aethusa.

293
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:18,240
-Then I have another question concerning anemia during pregnancy.

294
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:21,270
Could you say something about that issue?

295
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:25,930
-Forget it, there is no specific remedy.

296
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:41,170
Local anesthesia also is possible to antidote, in the dentist.

297
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,280
-I have a question about alcoholism.

298
00:35:52,380 --> 00:36:04,740
A couple friends of ours the man came and told us that his wife was drinking secretly

299
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:12,990
and we knew this, it wasn't that secret.

300
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:18,240
So he asked if I could do something ,if she wants to get help.

301
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:26,760
My question is what potency do I use? Do I go very high or do I go lower often?

302
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:34,580
-For the one who is drinking?
-When I find the remedy.

303
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:39,250
-And she is drinking a lot and you want to give the remedy without him knowing?

304
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:47,580
-No, no, no. If she wants treatment, because her husband asked me if I could do something

305
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:55,680
and when I find the remedy, will I go high or will I go low?

306
00:36:56,370 --> 00:37:02,490
-You go high and you repeat but the first thing that she has to agree is

307
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:05,920
that she likes to stop drinking.

308
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:12,510
If she says you give me the remedy, so I will stop drinking, forget it.

309
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:19,400
Maybe she will stop drinking for a while and then she will go back.

310
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:24,410
The will of the person...The same thing with drugs.

311
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:36,490
When you have a person under drugs, you have to have supporting team to make him decide

312
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:39,050
that I don't want to take drugs anymore.
