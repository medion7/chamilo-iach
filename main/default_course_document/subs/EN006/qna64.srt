1
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,530
-If someone is taking a medicine for high blood pressure,

2
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,640
is it necessary to repeat every day the homeopathic remedy?

3
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:40,130
-Sometimes yes, you have to repeat every day.

4
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,540
-Besides the allopathic medication?

5
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,300
-Besides the allopathic definitely you have to repeat.

6
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:02,460
-In the beginning of this teaching, I get a little shock in hearing your emotional blockage.

7
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:10,950
It really shows that a good indicated chosen remedy cannot heal blockages in emotional level.

8
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:17,550
-Blockages yes but the type of blockages I'm talking about it's difficult.

9
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:24,130
I'm sure you can cure most of the blockages.

10
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:36,450
You try to heal somebody who is in depression

11
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:42,960
and that somebody has a problem in the family which is not solved.

12
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:47,460
All the time, all the day they see the problem, they live with the problem

13
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,290
and the problem affects them.

14
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,950
Because you may live with a problem but don't see the problem.

15
00:01:54,050 --> 00:02:00,950
You accept the problem, you say no problem but if the problem affects you

16
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:08,190
and it is there in your family all the time, then this can become a blockage

17
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:12,550
which does not allow the organism to go forward.

18
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:31,280
-What can we do to help such patients with such blockages or what would you do in such a case?

19
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:49,440
-I would recommend other means like Acupuncture or Psychotherapy or whatever.

20
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:54,540
I'll tell them yes you do it.

21
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:06,100
Sometimes these people they have to resort into chemical drugs or into prescription drugs.

22
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,200
Especially the husband syndrome.

23
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,940
The husband syndrome is a very dangerous syndrome

24
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:31,790
and you may end up taking Valium or Tavor.

25
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,770
-I would like to know if you ever give patient consolation,

26
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,020
how he should behave to better his condition.

27
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:50,530
For instance in the case of Sabine how we had seen that she didn't behave well

28
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:54,080
according to her fever, you didn't say nothing.

29
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,980
I would like the concept behind if we ever give consolation to the patient.

30
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:13,720
-Consolation is different. Consultation, advice it depends.

31
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:24,960
If I feel that advice is needed, for instance I will tell them don't go out tonight and tomorrow.

32
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:34,520
This in Sabine's case I would say don't go out to eat. She will feel quite good by tonight.

33
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:45,120
You may see her in the restaurants. This is not good because the organism may relapse.

34
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:59,920
I will tell them not to and I know that the correct remedy creates an idea that I'm well now.

35
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,430
I feel well, why should I stay inside?

36
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:11,010
This is misleading because the organism is very weak and it can be overturned

37
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,110
and relapsing very quickly.

38
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:35,010
-One very important question concerning aetheric substances, like thyme,

39
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:44,860
like sage aromatic. We discussed it several times.

40
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:57,260
-Aromatic I cannot say but there are some people who are sensitive to certain aromas

41
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:17,950
and these they should avoid. But in general the aromatherapy they put in the body an oil.

42
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:25,440
I have no experience, I cannot really tell.

43
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,940
-We discussed whether ouzo is an antidote?

44
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:42,290
-It depends how much, if you drink a bottle like this, most probably.

45
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:50,020
-I would like to clear something about Palladium.

46
00:06:53,530 --> 00:07:05,930
Did you see cases of Palladium that they did fish for compliments and also praising themselves?

47
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:11,180
Saying what they think about themselves, that they are OK.

48
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,680
-They have to be very progressed, very much going to the mental.

49
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:38,190
He thinks he is the best basketball player. But this is almost mental.

50
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:48,600
They can think it and maybe they can say it in a way but not overtly.

51
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:55,600
If they do it like this it's Platina. They can imply it.

52
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:07,500
-According to you Americans can now drink decaffeinated coffee?

53
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:19,110
-Yes according to the GV. I would produce a GV coffee.

54
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:23,940
-You would make a fortune more than remedies.

55
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:30,840
-Who is speaking? The American spirit.

56
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:40,750
-That ice cream that has coffee in it, even small amounts or yogurt or candies?

57
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:53,940
-Small amounts in cold drink or in ice cream it's OK.

58
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,730
-You have made millions of Americans happy.

59
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:06,280
-I hope millions of Americans will take Homeopathy.

60
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:14,420
-Just out of personal interest could you please explain to me what you mean

61
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:20,920
with being eligible to take exams? If you are not allowed to practice in your own country?

62
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:31,690
-Yes. Those who have the legal right, this is a condition which was said from the beginning.

63
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:37,500
Those who have the legal right to practice in their respective countries

64
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:48,180
are allowed to take the examination. Otherwise they will just take a Certificate of attendance.

65
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:57,080
That means if you are allowed legally to practice in your country,

66
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:02,180
you are eligible to take part in the examinations.

67
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:16,830
I'm not eligible to take part in the examination because in Greece only medical doctors

68
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:20,860
are allowed to practice legally Homeopathy.

69
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:29,330
-I don't want to do any splitting but I'm Dutch and in Holland I'm legally allowed to practice

70
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:34,090
but at the moment I'm living in France, where legally I'm not allowed to practice.

71
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:39,410
-So you are not eligible. You are eligible to practice only in Holland.

72
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,930
So if you want to practice in France...

73
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:59,660
If you bluff me and you say I'm practicing in Holland and I'm allowed

74
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,160
and you take this Diploma and you go to France.

75
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:10,760
In the Diploma we will write underneath that this Diploma does not give you the right

76
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:18,240
to practice, it gives you only the confirmation that you know Classical Homeopathy.

77
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:23,580
The right is given by the respective country in which you practice.

78
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,100
We will write this in the Diploma.

79
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:35,500
So if you want to take examinations, you will take examinations because you say I'm Dutch

80
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,250
and in Holland I'm allowed to practice and I want to take examination.

81
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:45,840
The Diploma will be valid for Holland.

82
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:56,510
-You said it again and again that you believe in the institution of marriage.

83
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:10,090
Two people living together and of course you also said that if they cheat each other,

84
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:17,340
this is not very good but if they build a true love, this is better.

85
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,330
Could you a little bit elaborate more on how a man and a woman

86
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:28,330
who live together may help each other to remain in health?

87
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:34,920
Do you feel that by living together they can be more healthy and it what way?

88
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:50,600
-This is really a big issue and it cannot be answered immediately.

89
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:57,340
It depends on the culture of different nations first.

90
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:04,320
The second is when we say marriage, what do we mean?

91
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:15,080
Do we mean a decision and whether this decision for one or for both means bondage,

92
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:20,420
not marriage. This is not good and unhealthy.

93
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:27,670
There are people who live very well together without being married.

94
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:33,570
I knew a couple like this, for 10 years they lived beautifully

95
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:42,070
and suddenly they decided to marry and in 2-3 months they divorced.

96
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,150
They didn't want to see each other.

97
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:49,070
They were living for 10 years, each one living in his own house, they met together,

98
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:56,570
they did everything together, they were very much in love, sexually very good.

99
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:04,830
They got the idea of marriage and they married and the whole thing is finished.

100
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:12,980
From my experience in looking upon the different nations and understanding

101
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:19,650
what is happening with human nature, I have come to the conclusion

102
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:37,400
that a marriage can hold only if the two parties, not only the woman,

103
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:46,660
come together for the first time and they have sex for the first time together in the marriage.

104
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:51,680
In such case the marriage will stay.

105
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:11,150
You feel very secure in the situation of the marriage and the pleasure is quite good even

106
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:23,580
if there is no very much chemistry.

107
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:38,550
If we had societies that could restrict the young people from going into sexual activities,

108
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:46,140
when they were 13 or 14, we could have marriage that would stick.

109
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:55,830
When I was in America in 80's and it was a class like this, I said how many of you

110
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:59,820
have been divorced once?

111
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,640
The whole class raised their hands.

112
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:12,290
As you go towards more to the South and you reach India for instance,

113
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:19,800
out of this class perhaps two would raise their hands even today. What is the difference?

114
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:29,540
The difference is that these people don't have sex before marriage. This is the big secret.

115
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,800
Whether you believe it or not, whether you want to accept it or not,

116
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:38,130
whether you feel this is regression or going back to the Dark Ages,

117
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:48,880
I don't say that we have to go back to the Dark Ages and forbid sex. You cannot do it.

118
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:58,050
But the people who managed to retain themselves and not going into sexual activity

119
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:03,050
before marriage are the most lucky people.

120
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:08,140
They are the people who are going to live a harmonious marriage life.

121
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:15,290
But if you have learned from young age to go with one girl, to go with one man, check this,

122
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:24,290
check the other, in the end it's nothing for you to say bye, bye, I don't like you.

123
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:28,150
Because you are used to this idea before.

124
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:38,830
Also this society may develop eventually into such a society because either the society

125
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:48,070
has to degrade and die or it has to regenerate and understand consciously

126
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:55,570
that these values have to be respected by the human beings.

127
00:17:55,670 --> 00:18:04,080
You cannot destroy all values that we consider as values in life.

128
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:07,010
You cannot because you are going to pay.

129
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:13,500
You can not destroy the laws totally and say I don't care, I have the power.

130
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,350
Which power? You are going to die.

131
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:28,760
When you come to me trembling from fear, the death is near. Where are your bombs now?

132
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:37,650
Everyone is under these laws, so society will understand eventually

133
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:48,510
what laws has to respect and then you will see another society all together.

134
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:53,010
A totally different from the society we have today.

135
00:18:53,510 --> 00:19:03,580
And then I can tell you something, I will be dead long time before this happens

136
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:15,430
but I can predict, in such a society the young people will fall in love with the right person.

137
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:26,810
If you wait long enough, holding back, the emotions become stronger and stronger

138
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:40,570
and you will recognize, you will have the innocence to recognize the real partner.

139
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:48,810
And the society will be another society all together.

140
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,630
Now what happens?

141
00:19:50,730 --> 00:20:01,490
You make the first mistake too early, then you are bound to make the second mistake very soon

142
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:04,720
because it's very painful, you have to get out of pain.

143
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:08,650
And how you get out of pain? You get another boyfriend, get another girlfriend.

144
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:13,630
Then how you get out of this pain? Another and another and you reach marriage

145
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:25,740
with this experience and both the individuals, they have become individualistic.

146
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:31,640
But marriage says I give you myself and you give me yourself.

147
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:41,640
You give up the idea of I'm the strong part. You give up!

148
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,480
How can you do it unless you are innocent?
