1
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,240
-Important questions.

2
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:30,320
-If you see what your computer repertorization always symptoms that you put

3
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,430
just by your estimation.

4
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:41,670
I would like to know how you do the hierarchy of those symptoms?

5
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:49,320
-This repertorization, what you see, I hardly say a symptom.

6
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:54,400
I discuss with the case and Margaret is there or Christian is there

7
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,840
and they put their own symptoms.

8
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:12,340
Then I look from time to time what this repertorization is coming out.

9
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:22,810
I don't say put this symptom, put that symptom, no. Neither underline the symptoms.

10
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:31,490
But I get some ideas whatever they hear, they put the symptoms

11
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,240
and that's why there are so many symptoms in the Repertory.

12
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,740
There are not my symptoms, it's their symptoms.

13
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,310
Sometimes I agree or I disagree with the symptom.

14
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:52,900
You don't give always the remedy that comes first, like the Aurum sulphuratum.

15
00:01:53,650 --> 00:02:00,080
Aurum sulphuratum was not there at all in the repertorization.

16
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:15,070
Like the way I said about Palladium. Palladium was not except of the first symptoms.

17
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,240
-Nevertheless I would be interested when you take a case what are important symptoms for you?

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,910
-Symptoms can become important if they are peculiar.

19
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:39,220
Like the one we saw this deep breath, this is a peculiar symptom

20
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,730
you better take into consideration.

21
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:46,720
But as you take a case, you miss a peculiar symptom.

22
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:52,070
This was a peculiar symptom, I did not open the Repertory to see it.

23
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:58,390
So what is important to have a peculiar symptom.

24
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:06,490
What is very important is to have a symptom present, not only in the past.

25
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:18,140
What is important is to see whether some symptoms are coming, showing a Lachesis

26
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:23,650
but then the present symptom shows Belladonna.

27
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:30,470
So the present symptoms are important, the peculiar symptoms are important,

28
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:38,390
symptoms which are clearly expressed by the patient are important.

29
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:44,300
But always see what are the present symptoms.

30
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:53,560
At a certain moment I could show you in the repertorization

31
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,820
where at first I thought of Phosphorus.

32
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,060
Then I was investigating Phosphorus.

33
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:13,730
If you investigate a remedy, you don't take in consideration a symptom which is like this type.

34
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:18,400
It has to be very strong. You investigate keynotes of the remedy.

35
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,650
You have to get this keynote strongly.

36
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:30,900
I was investigating the sympathetic element with her. I had to see that this was very strong.

37
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:40,640
I was investigating the clairvoyance, how strong. I was not happy with how strong.

38
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:46,890
Startling easily she said, that's another Phosphorus symptom.

39
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:53,650
When she came to the sympathetic element of Phosphorus, then it was strong.

40
00:04:54,650 --> 00:05:03,850
Then the aversion to eggs, you show it, everyone put it three times.

41
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:13,210
So these symptoms which are clear, you need to work with them.

42
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,210
What are the symptoms which belong to her personality.

43
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:29,440
She is a strong woman. She has become strong out of circumstances.

44
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:33,290
It is her character, her personality.

45
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:45,020
Also what you think is strong or weak is different than the person himself.

46
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,370
You have to take into consideration that.

47
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:04,550
In the same way you see the Phosphorus, this little angel,

48
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:08,780
and you see the other Phosphorus and you see the difference in personalities.

49
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:17,200
And you see a third personality. It is different personalities but the underline symptomatology,

50
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,460
the pathology is Phosphorus.

51
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,510
What it may be confusing for you is the difference in personality.

52
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:30,260
She is more closed, she is closed and open, she is affected etc.

53
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:36,860
But you are taking into consideration the personality.

54
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:44,920
You say for her she is too strong for Phosphorus. For her also you said the same thing.

55
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:52,920
She is too strong for Phosphorus. No, it's the same thing. It's her personality.

56
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,930
I've told you many times with the Pulsatilla.

57
00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:02,760
You get the idea from the books that Pulsatilla is weak, easily led etc.

58
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:11,510
This is the pathology. If a very strong woman can become a little bit weak,

59
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:14,520
then she goes to Pulsatilla but still she is very strong.

60
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:29,160
I told you the Ministry of Exports in India, she was a powerful woman,

61
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:37,420
she would do transaction and I saw a little bit of weakness.

62
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:45,760
That was enough for her personality, for me to be persuaded that she is going towards Pulsatilla.

63
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:50,310
So don't mix the personality with the pathology.

64
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:57,840
Pathology is she cannot take a deep breath. That's pathology. I can't take a deep breath.

65
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:06,970
Then that is a symptom of sighing, she did not say sighing.

66
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:12,710
She says my breathing is superficial.

67
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:17,130
I do not look because there is not such a symptom, superficial breathing

68
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,630
and then I go of course to the essential.

69
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:29,800
It is better to go to the essentials and see the picture and say that is now a Phosphorus case.

70
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:40,080
This case which is Phosphorus to be confirmed by symptoms like this. It is better.

71
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:48,760
You have done a better job than just have given on superficial breathing Phosphorus.

72
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,970
She may not being Phosphorus.

73
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:54,210
The fact that she has been Phosphorus and she confirmed by the symptom,

74
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:58,340
then it's beautiful, then you feel comfortable.

75
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:07,690
But the recent symptom, Phosphorus. The most recent symptom, Phosphorus.

76
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:13,550
What continues? Sympathetic element. What has gone away? The fear.

77
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:20,400
The fear of thunderstorm, this anxiety, this openness she had as a child will come back.

78
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:34,780
As a child she was open. She will go through a period where she will feel this openness again.

79
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:48,390
She will lose this barrier. She will be more connected, she will make more easy friends.

80
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:55,000
She will have a boyfriend or a husband in six months.

81
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:01,660
-I only wanted to make a few remarks concerning the repertorization.

82
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:07,790
Because this repertorization in my eyes is a kind of documentation

83
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:11,800
because when we do the follow-up we have which symptoms did she have.

84
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:16,660
I would never make a repertorization where I put every symptom into the computer at home

85
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,990
and I hope that [name] didn't get the impression that we put symptom, symptom, symptom

86
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,740
and make together a remedy.

87
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:32,240
Because at home normally you don't have someone beside you work on the computer.

88
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:38,600
You take the case, evaluate and then you go to the computer.

89
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:45,750
-It is true but if I was teaching you repertorization,

90
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:49,990
I would say do repertorization in different ways.

91
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:54,440
You put a few symptoms, you look. You put more symptoms, you look again.

92
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:59,180
You put one more symptom, you look again. One more symptom, what happened?

93
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,410
You look again. This is how you do repertorization.

94
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:05,660
You don't put all the symptoms and see what comes in the end.

95
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:13,150
You see what comes step by step and then you have an idea of different remedies,

96
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,140
from which you are going to choose the right one.

97
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,730
Then after you have all the information, you put it down, you analyze it,

98
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:25,350
then you come back to the case and you think now what shall I do.

99
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:36,240
If she was a Phosphorus case, now still Phosphorus symptoms appear,

100
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:40,680
then that is a beautiful case of Phosphorus.

101
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:44,420
That means she is going to be benefited deeply by Phosphorus.

102
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,910
-I would also like to say that when I'm sitting beside you putting symptoms,

103
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:04,400
you keep asking questions to confirm remedies like ideas of a remedy that could be possible.

104
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:10,820
You ask certain questions and if it's no, I just leave it out and if it's yes, I put it in.

105
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:16,080
So what comes up like in that case in the first few minutes

106
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,020
there was Palladium coming up of course.

107
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:25,720
Also Aurum sulphuricum was coming up but as we proceeded it was coming back.

108
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,570
So this is very important to do the repertorization step by step.

109
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:36,000
You put a symptom or two just to make an analysis and see how it develops.

110
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,560
In my practices it's very possible that the remedy I prescribe in the end, it's not on top.

111
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,920
That's normal.

112
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:52,000
Also Lilium tigrinum was coming up very high at the beginning.

113
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:06,570
-Also it is interesting that sometimes I arrive at a stage where I write the remedy, Sepia.

114
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:12,750
Then I ask tell me, he has put Sepia. Sepia is on top.

115
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:20,810
Because I do a repertorization of course with what I know from the Repertory

116
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:25,820
but coincides many times with what is coming out.

117
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:41,070
Without repertorization I feel that you will not be secure.

118
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:46,320
You think many times the remedy is correct.

119
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:57,310
Just do the repertorization and confirm, don't leave it to chance.

120
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:09,820
-We had some cases where you prescribed remedies in low potency like C6, 7

121
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:15,800
or even D to be raised one week a time and take it continuously

122
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,800
over a certain amount of weeks of even months.

123
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,640
I'm very familiar with this kind of administering of remedies.

124
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:22,900
My fear would be that I lead the patient into an over stimulation

125
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:34,750
because I keep repeating, repeating and I haven't heard any advice from you to the patient,

126
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:40,320
what to do if he gets an aggravation after a certain time?

127
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:49,960
-I suppose that everybody knows that if there is an aggravation they will stop the remedy.

128
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,480
If there is aggravation, stop the remedy.

129
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,710
-And wait how long?

130
00:14:53,810 --> 00:15:00,210
-In such cases until the aggravation goes and then better, wait and then relapse,

131
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:04,440
then you stop again.

132
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:17,000
This case Acetanilidum, the nephrotic syndrome we did not discuss

133
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,990
because I think we discussed it already.

134
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:34,950
These symptoms he continues with the same remedy and as you know we gave 200.

135
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:40,570
It was not real effect, then we went down very much to 12.

136
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:49,610
Then he started having an effect and we have repeatedly given low potency.

137
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:55,750
Now last time we went even lower to 6C.

138
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:03,570
I want to see what is happening but as I see by the repetition

139
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:14,600
the case is progressing more and more. And this case is quite a serious case. He is here.

140
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:25,140
He was treated in Norway by two nephrologists and they have been given Methotrexate

141
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:38,570
and cortisone very strong to control the albumin of the urine. This is a serious condition.

142
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,000
They know it very well and that's why they said that nobody can help you.

143
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:49,730
When he said I'm going down to Greece, they said forget it, this is nonsense.

144
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:54,720
Who can help you? So it's serious pathology.

145
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:59,530
The remedy was very clear fortunately for me.

146
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,020
Who has seen the case originally?

147
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:17,690
You have not seen it originally? The original case on the video?

148
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:25,210
-Yes.
-OK.

149
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:30,650
It doesn't matter whether you saw it on video or live it does not matter.

150
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:47,970
Also another case of cancer of the pancreas with metastasis in the liver,

151
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,720
you have not seen this case?

152
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,970
It's the Italian group?
-Yes.

153
00:17:54,070 --> 00:18:02,060
-That is a similar situation where we repeat for second year now, we repeat in low potency

154
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,630
and we just slowly go up.

155
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:12,140
Serious pathology the remedy becomes clear eventually.

156
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:18,750
In his case the remedy was clear originally, in the other case he needed three remedies

157
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:27,110
before the remedy was clear in the case of cancer.

158
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:37,010
Now I think we complete two years in a case they have given him only three months.

159
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,480
In three months you die.

160
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:46,140
We repeat for 1 1/2 year almost. For half a year he took three remedies

161
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:58,720
and then the rest is taking the same remedy in low potency. The same way we try for this case.

162
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:10,140
So when we have strong pathology the organism cannot push.

163
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:17,640
The high potency is like an electrical push, an energy push.

164
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,890
It needs the whole organism to be in a position to follow.

165
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:27,140
If it is not in a position to follow because of an organ breaking down,

166
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,070
then you have to stimulate slowly.

167
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:34,030
You will learn, you will see these cases.

168
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:41,800
Maybe I will show you these cases which is in Greek and translated in Italian.

169
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:48,430
-If the vital force is so weak, as in her case, would it may be a possibility

170
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:53,110
to continue the treatment by giving a C30 once the day.

171
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:59,380
Because of all the potencies she has had this acted best or it would not be so good?

172
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:16,610
-This is really a problem with this little one because I have seen several times

173
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:26,440
and everybody who was near could see being totally out, paralyzed

174
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:31,370
and just by touching the Phosphorus she is back.

175
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:39,440
We don't have it on video yet but I think it would be very impressive to have it on video.

176
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:44,690
That means she is very sensitive to Phosphorus, there is no question.

177
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:52,770
Why she does not stay? Maybe she needs more time, maybe she needs another potency.

178
00:20:52,870 --> 00:21:03,200
So my idea would be actually not to give her 30 but to give her more material dose.

179
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:09,950
And let her have an aggravation, if there is an aggravation like 6C,

180
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:14,390
don't go to the Q potency.

181
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:26,040
But 6C and give one every day and when there is an aggravation you stop.

182
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:29,020
Then you continue.

183
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:44,430
In case there is a collapse, you have 6,7,8,9,10 and if there is a collapse you got one more.

184
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:51,610
Let us say you take 6,6,6,6 one month, then there is a collapse.

185
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:57,590
You give 7 and then you start 7 every day. Then there is a collapse, 8,9

186
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:03,940
and you go higher like this and we'll see how she will be doing.

187
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:10,760
-I want to ask there is a paragraph in the Organon that Hahnemann says that you

188
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:17,920
shouldn't repeat any potency. I think it's 246 or 247 that you shouldn't

189
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:25,180
because the vital force is not in the same, as it used to be, when you gave him the remedy.

190
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:32,160
Here I see that sometimes people do repeat low potencies, high potencies.

191
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:38,180
For instance in the Phosphorus to repeat very low potency, I found out

192
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:44,020
that it gives hemorrhages for instance.

193
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:50,680
-If the remedy is not correct, it may give some hemorrhage.

194
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:54,270
-If it's correct?
-No.

195
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:05,170
But you see in his case Acetanilidum, you go 200, you have no effect.

196
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:08,020
You go to low potency, you have an effect.

197
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:20,260
The same way with the cancer case. We went to 200, no effect.

198
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:28,280
We went down to 12 I think, immediately it showed an effect.

199
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:36,180
So we don't know everything and we just are careful into going into these matters.

200
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:52,260
With Tom's case with the kidneys, if we take the initial action, I answer to you

201
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:57,110
because being Phosphorus you are anxious.

202
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:09,070
If we take his initial reaction, no reaction, nothing, Acetanilidum no reaction,

203
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:11,820
you will see nothing happened.

204
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:20,310
But his case is more than 60% better now by going lower and by repeating.

205
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:24,430
You cannot deny these facts.

206
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:36,230
-Are there any special rules for giving potencies?

207
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:44,100
Which potencies to give for pregnant women and for small children or babies?

208
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,630
-Small children and babies you can go very high, this is the rule

209
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:53,380
unless it is a life threatening situation.

210
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:59,710
You don't go and give very high, the moment that the baby cannot breathe

211
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:05,040
and it's blue you give a CM. No.

212
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:15,880
Was anybody in the Cicuta case in Alonissos where by mistake I said 30

213
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:28,630
and they gave CM in an epileptic child, paralyzed, retarded?

214
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:40,440
And I said 30, they didn't have 30, they did not ask me, we could not find 30, we give CM.

215
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:47,450
And it was a very severe aggravation to the extent that the child could not breathe.

216
00:25:47,550 --> 00:26:00,900
We try to find some oxygen, by this time, I'm talking back to 80 or 81.

217
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:11,470
There was no oxygen, there was nothing actually and the child got over.

218
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:20,450
But you don't go and give in such severe pathology very high potency.

219
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:28,420
The children you can go very high, as long as it's not a life threatening situation.

220
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:38,530
-I asked also about the pregnant women, if there is any problem?

221
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:43,780
-Pregnant women you don't have problems as long as the remedy is correct.

222
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,300
But you may have problems if the remedy is incorrect.

223
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:54,410
Incorrect remedy you may have some problem because the woman during pregnancy

224
00:26:54,510 --> 00:27:06,720
she is in a sensitive situation and with incorrect remedy you may have some complications.

225
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:19,300
Do you remember the case in Aedipsos? Who was in Aedipsos? Only Richard.

226
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:29,040
Where she gave birth to twins.

227
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:39,450
Then what happened is that she started to have dilatation of the uterus

228
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:41,980
by 10 o'clock in the morning.

229
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:58,730
By 10.30 she was given by absolute stupid for me reason, she was given Sepia 10M.

230
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:09,460
As a result the dilatation stopped, the uterus collapsed and she could not give birth.

231
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:20,040
Until it was 9 o'clock in the night and we had a tremendous battle.

232
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:24,120
Because one of the students went, discussed with her.

233
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:32,620
I said why did you give Sepia? She said because I saw some mark in her thigh.

234
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:44,120
I said did you realize what you have done? The helicopter could not come, it was night.

235
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:52,140
There were twins, there was no contraction of the uterus. The uterus had collapsed.

236
00:28:54,520 --> 00:29:01,710
The gynecologist was there, a German gynecologist and we battled.

237
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:08,270
At a certain moment the one child was coming and the other came with the wrong position

238
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:11,020
and the uterus was not contracting.

239
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:16,310
He was trying to turn the child, the child would not turn and we were sweating

240
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:27,130
and he said to me the one child is dead, he made some signs. I said god.

241
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:38,940
He said what shall we do? We have to cut. We just had a scissor from the woman

242
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:47,950
who had the house. She brought a scissor they have when they cut the clothes.

243
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:56,080
We have to cut the child to bring it out piece by piece.

244
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:07,200
I said forget it. We battled. You have to be careful.

245
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:18,450
By 9 o'clock in the night, it was almost 11 hours. 11 hours there was no movement at all.

246
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:25,530
And then as I was desperate, I asked her tell me the symptoms. What you felt?

247
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:31,890
She gave me the symptoms and they were symptoms of Pulsatilla.

248
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:38,780
Then I give the Pulsatilla and I said to the others in one hour she will start giving birth.

249
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:46,120
9.50 she started giving birth, one child came out and then the second child came in this position.

250
00:30:52,040 --> 00:31:02,110
And he was trying to turn and he said push, push and she got cramps and she fainted.

251
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:11,200
He told me don't let her faint, then Carbo vegetabilis, Cuprum.

252
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:20,850
I just throw remedies to keep her alive and to make her able to push with the uterus.

253
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,100
It was terrible.

254
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:27,450
Because the child could not come. The one child came out, the other child would die.

255
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:42,230
We have to be careful with the pregnancy, that we make sure that the remedy is correct.

256
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:54,050
-I have a question concerning the administering of homeopathic remedies during pregnancy.

257
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:59,310
Is there any risk that those remedies are given to the mother could do the child any harm

258
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:05,150
because of course it is the victim within the whole process that is going on?

259
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:11,300
-With the homeopathic remedy in pregnancy there is no problem with side effects.

260
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:15,550
Something happening to the child, something happening to the mother.

261
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:23,900
What I say is we have to be careful with the remedies that affect the uterus especially.

262
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:32,050
Causticum, Ustilago, Caulophyllum, Sepia.

263
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:38,460
Such remedies, if you give, you make sure that they are indicated.

264
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:47,380
Otherwise the wrong remedy will have some aggravation that it is not for...

265
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:58,210
But if you go and repeat Phosphorus, 200 every day, she is pregnant

266
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:03,810
and she does not need Phosphorus, you may have some hemorrhage.

267
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:09,750
This is what I say, you have to be a little bit careful.

268
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:16,190
There is no side effects that some damage will be done to the child or anything of that type

269
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:19,540
which we have with chemical drugs.

270
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,960
We don't have toxicity at all.

271
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:45,380
-A homeopath in Austria he gives remedies to pregnant women by way of so called "ugenic cure".

272
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:55,780
You give nosodes high potency at certain stage of the pregnancy.

273
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:02,890
It's not classic Homeopathy but some homeopaths do it and recommend it still.

274
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:11,270
What he found out was that the child had a defect when it was born

275
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:20,060
and the defect of the organ system, the time when the organ system was developed,

276
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:26,280
was matching the time when he gave this remedy, one of these remedies.

277
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,630
-What was the defect?

278
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:34,380
-I think it was cardio-vascular but I'm not sure.

279
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:40,540
And since then he stopped practicing this type of cure.

280
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:48,280
-It's good that this happened but I don't believe that such a defect could be initiated

281
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:51,200
by homeopathic remedy, I don't believe it.

282
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:12,510
The homeopathic remedy can go deep and have an aggravation, which is quite strong

283
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:19,050
but in such a case the child is going to be benefited definitely.

284
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:25,940
If it is a superficial aggravation, there is no effect on the child. It is like a proving.

285
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:33,370
You give a remedy and you do a proving in a child or whoever. There is no danger.

286
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:47,710
If you give a high potency and you repeat it for months, 50M for months, of course...

287
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,700
It may be making a deep proving.

288
00:35:56,450 --> 00:36:02,270
-I can add a public case for problem from wrong remedies during pregnancy

289
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:07,770
that it was published last year in Germany where a homeopath gave Carcinosin.

290
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:12,610
Carcinosin not indicated, only with family problems on cancer,

291
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:15,860
to a pregnant woman with asthma problems.

292
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:22,870
So asthma aggravated and comes an abortion and it was very ugly aggravation

293
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:25,710
due to wrong remedy by pregnancy.

294
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:39,780
-One is what you think about the practice which is done sometimes

295
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,110
if you have a nursing mother and a baby.

296
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:50,200
The baby is ill and the mother received the remedy because she can give it to the child by nursing.

297
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:54,920
That's one question.
-This can happen yes.

298
00:36:55,020 --> 00:37:02,270
It can affect the child. The mother gets the remedy, she is nursing, the child also gets the remedy.

299
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:07,930
-The other question is, the mother is ill and the child is ill and the child

300
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:12,630
needs a different remedy than the mother. What do we do in this case?

301
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,710
-Give different remedy.

302
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:27,350
-I think maybe you misunderstood something here because I cannot agree at all with what you said.

303
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:33,860
You can't basically always say that if the child is ill, while the mother is still nursing

304
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,600
that you always administer the remedy to the mother

305
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:41,860
because also can have an effect from this remedy.

306
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:48,860
I think if the remedy does not fit to the mother, you can't give it to the mother.

307
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:55,930
-First of all I answered to the question whether by giving a remedy to the mother,

308
00:37:56,030 --> 00:38:03,430
the child also may be affected and I said yes. It can happen, we have seen certain cases

309
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:07,200
where the child is affected.

310
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:13,850
The diarrhea of the child stops when the mother takes the remedy. That's one thing.

311
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:18,610
The other thing we have seen, the mother is sick, the child is sick.

312
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:21,440
They need two different remedies.

313
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:27,780
The other question that you are asking, the mother is sick and needs Argentum nitricum.

314
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:32,260
The boy also needs Argentum nitricum, you give it also to the boy

315
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:38,510
but we have seen cases actually where the mother takes the remedy and the child is affected.

316
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:45,540
Also we have seen that. But don't make a rule that when the child is sick,

317
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,750
you give a remedy to the mother.

318
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:57,970
Such a rule is wrong because you have to take into consideration the child who is sick.

319
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:02,820
You have to take the symptomatology and maybe it's another remedy, it's not the same remedy.

320
00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:14,130
-Maybe you understood Mayra wrong because she asked because of the paragraph

321
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:25,900
that says that every time you repeat a remedy, you have to little change the potency by shaking.

322
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Not give the same remedy, not changed.

323
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,990
-Is that what you said?

324
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:49,810
What Hahnemann was saying in the last edition is that he went back to the LM potencies

325
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:59,070
and he says you repeat this, it's good to shake them. That idea I also agree, it's OK.

326
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:03,310
You take it for one week and then you go higher.

327
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:09,960
What you are saying is a little detail for me that during this week is good

328
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:14,320
that you also shake it twice, it's good yes.

329
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:23,840
But if you don't shake it for me it's going to be the same. It's not an important issue.

330
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:35,110
If the remedy is acting in a low potency, it's going to act whether you shake it or not.

331
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:45,120
In this case, the cancer case, you will see that the person says the remedy stopped acting

332
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:59,280
because of the control with the phosphatase and the gamma GT and the transaminases.

333
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:03,870
You will see the remedy stops, then all these start going up.

334
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:07,690
Then you will go higher the remedy and all these start to go down.

335
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:13,770
Then you repeat the remedy and then eventually going up again.

336
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:16,770
Then you go higher and this is the experience.

337
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:23,610
Now we don't know everything at this moment, neither me, not anybody.

338
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:32,960
How many times we should check. We are just developing the knowledge.

339
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:39,070
I'm giving my experience, I'm giving you real cases.

340
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:46,610
Here I don't hide anything. All the cases you have seen, I bring the follow ups.

341
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:50,720
Here it is, here what happens, here what we did.

342
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:59,220
As far as truth is concerned, you know exactly what I'm doing and how I'm proceeding

343
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:02,380
with a case and this is important for you at this moment.

344
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:08,900
You get this information, you get this knowledge at this moment.

345
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:16,630
Maybe after three years I will have crystallized different other ideas,

346
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:21,730
which I' m going to give them to you. At this moment these are the ideas.
