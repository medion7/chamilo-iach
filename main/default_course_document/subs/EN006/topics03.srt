00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:26,000
In Homeopathy we have impressive cures. There is no question.

2
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:42,550
But I want to say one more thing because a lot of problems have started

3
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:50,520
because of some wrong advertising of Homeopathy.

4
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:59,910
We cannot come out in the world, that means in the mass media,

5
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:09,330
and claim that we cure cancer, we cure AIDS, we cure multiple sclerosis.

6
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:13,930
We cannot and we must not do this.

7
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:22,080
The reason is that we cannot cure diseases. We cure patients.

8
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:30,080
Maybe a patient with cancer case we manage to cure but we cannot manage to cure

9
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,600
the other 9 cases.

10
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:40,260
Somebody can say, OK you said you cure cancer? Take these 10 cases and cure them.

11
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:53,880
The media attacks Homeopathy, especially in the English speaking world, viciously.

12
00:01:53,980 --> 00:02:10,960
Guardian published an article against Homeopathy demanding from WHO

13
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:20,780
that denounces Homeopathy because homeopaths claim that they cure AIDS, they cure cancer,

14
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:27,530
they cure tuberculosis, they cure whatever. Even they say influenzas.

15
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:37,520
We are the only ones that we have big success in influenza, much bigger than Tamiflu or whatever

16
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:46,440
but still we cannot come out and claim, unless we stick on the main ideas.

17
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:54,800
We stimulate the immune system and the organism, if it has a possibility will cure.

18
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:07,190
The main thing is that we have to become more and more precise and knowledgeable

19
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,540
in order to have a better effect.

20
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:17,290
To have effect and then Homeopathy will spread.

21
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:28,690
In Germany you have a lot of people against Homeopathy. In Germany!

22
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:37,600
According to me you have the biggest brain ever lived in the world,

23
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:45,200
Hahnemann and nobody knows him or they don't want to know him.

24
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:53,950
That is something that really makes me sad to understand this situation.

25
00:03:55,710 --> 00:04:09,940
It's not because we are unable to apply Homeopathy properly,

26
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,540
that it is the fault of Hahnemann.

27
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:21,330
Learn properly Homeopathy and then you will see the effect and then Homeopathy will be respected.

28
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:32,900
It is not normal that such a tremendous possibility, as we have, it goes to the gutter

29
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,080
just because the teachers, those who teach Homeopathy,

30
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:44,380
they don't know themselves Homeopathy.

31
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:53,090
This is unfortunate but this is true. We have a lot of theories and blah, blah, blah.

32
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:59,190
But when we have the patients in front of me I don't know what to do.

33
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:14,010
When the patient comes, they say give anything.

34
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:22,260
Give anything you go to the side of the placebo and then you have placebo effect.

35
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:29,640
Something will happen to some hysterical people who are thinking now I got my right remedy

36
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,940
and they are stimulated.
