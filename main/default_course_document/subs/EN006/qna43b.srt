1
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,720
-Another question? No question.

2
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:35,270
-We have that allopathic remedies can interfere with homeopathic remedies

3
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:45,710
and that is why I wanted to ask what about the pill or other allopathic remedies or pain killers?

4
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,990
-Yes, pain killers they will influence the case definitely.

5
00:00:50,090 --> 00:01:08,120
Also the anti-contraceptive pill is influencing not so much, not so drastically

6
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:16,590
but in some cases we stopped this after we came to the conclusion

7
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:23,290
that the relapse was because of the pill. But not in all cases.

8
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:35,900
It is much better if you can use mechanical contraceptives, not hormonal.

9
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:59,180
-I saw in many cases after the suppression of the uterus, after the operation of hysterectomy

10
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:09,370
that the women are getting thyroid problems. Did you see the same?

11
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:25,530
I have now a case where she has thyroid problems and after the hysterectomy

12
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:35,760
she gets now problems of the genital hormones, the female hormones.

13
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,870
She is feeling much better but the problem is going back.

14
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:50,020
-After you gave a remedy for thyroid, she is better in the thyroid...

15
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:56,900
-Yes and generally she is better but the problem of hormonally disturbance,

16
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:04,100
sexual hormonal disturbance are coming back now.

17
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:13,610
-That is normal, what you say is normal though I have not seen it in all cases of hysterectomy

18
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:20,350
that the thyroid is affected but maybe this can happen.

19
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:25,630
And by correct treatment the thyroid is getting better and the hormonal disturbances

20
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:35,260
are coming, which means that she needs a second remedy now to regulate this level as well.

21
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:44,760
-But after this suppression of the uterus, after the hysterectomy, can we help really?

22
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,430
Because the uterus is gone.

23
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:54,190
-Yes we can help definitely, without the uterus.

24
00:03:54,290 --> 00:04:03,030
It would be more easy perhaps, if the uterus was there but you can help.

25
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:09,440
-Did you ever seen an application of the homeopathic remedy in ICD

26
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:15,540
and the contraceptive device come out?
-No.

27
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,340
-A question about pain killers. Supposing you are on a remedy and you have a severe headache.

28
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,090
The best thing is not to take anything but if it is unbearable,

29
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:33,590
is it better to take another specific remedy in low potency or pain killer?

30
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:41,340
-No. It is better to take aspirin, not any pain killer.

31
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:51,870
If you take Lonarid or Cafergot or this kind of pain killers it is dangerous

32
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:55,850
but aspirin is not so dangerous. You can take two aspirins.

33
00:04:55,950 --> 00:05:04,610
-What about paracetamol?
-Paracetamol also I don't trust very much.

34
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,180
Pure aspirin diluted in water.

35
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:18,270
Don't take it directly because it may just make a hole in your stomach

36
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:24,010
because it goes into the stomach and starts diluting, creating acidity

37
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:30,190
and it just can make a hole in the stomach.

38
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:34,280
Especially if there is some predisposition.

39
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:46,090
-I wish to tell you about paracetamol. In Germany there are some cases of child death

40
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,870
after taking paracetamol.

41
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,360
-Enormous amount.

42
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:08,850
-It really is a problem because in former times we gave aspirin to the children

43
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:15,100
and then the so called Reye's syndrome appeared, which brought death in children.

44
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:20,100
So it was a shift towards paracetamol and it was just a question of time

45
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,770
when you would find out the sides effects of paracetamol. They give it to every child.

46
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:31,980
It is forbidden to give aspirin to the children in fever diseases because of this Reye's syndrome.

47
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,700
So they will find out that Homeopathy is better.

48
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:54,810
-From a point of view of development of the case I have found out

49
00:06:54,910 --> 00:07:03,330
that aspirin does not interfere so much but the low potency of a homeopathic remedy,

50
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:10,570
if it is not the correct one, it can interfere. From that point of view it is better to give aspirin.

51
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:16,660
Of course if you are aware of the possible side effects,

52
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:22,910
then you ask if the child has taken before etc., you give it slowly,

53
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:27,020
you don't give 10 aspirins together.

54
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:40,060
-I've seen in family dynamics where a couple brings a wild child in for treatment.

55
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:47,230
Once the child is treated then it comes out that they sort of triangulating their problems

56
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:51,980
into the child and it's manifesting whatever problems they have.

57
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,480
As the child starts to cure, then you see the problems with the parents.

58
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,490
My question is have you ever seen that in a physical level,

59
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:08,400
for example when a woman whose child had psoriasis? Her psoriasis disappeared

60
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,160
when she gave birth and then the child got it.

61
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:16,510
So when she is cured, would you see go back to the mother on an energetic level?

62
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:21,490
Is that happened?
-Not in this way.

63
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:28,490
I also don't consider this fact when she gave birth, then her psoriasis disappeared.

64
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,740
I don't consider this as a family dynamics.

65
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,650
I consider it more on purely physical, chemical levels.

66
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:51,490
Family dynamics are mostly on an emotional level and an effort to readjust your emotionality

67
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:55,670
towards the new situation.

68
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:02,510
I have seen it for instance in women who have their daughters being married

69
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:08,230
and go away from the house. So we have this in Greece.

70
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:14,660
Of course in America you don't have it because children, once they reach age 14-15,

71
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,560
you have to go out, the mother says out.

72
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:24,410
Here in Greece they keep them in the house and there is a family dynamic.

73
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,900
The daughter is married and she is gone.

74
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,140
The mother does not have somebody anymore to look after.

75
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:36,570
She was looking after the daughter and she was active. And then she goes into depression.

76
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,680
That is what I consider as family dynamics.

77
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:47,720
That the mother may develop whatever, skin eruptions.

78
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:53,730
Usually they develop depression and also fear, anxiety, hypochondriasis,

79
00:09:53,830 --> 00:10:01,580
fear of dying and their place on the planet is shaken.

80
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:06,800
What is my role now? I don't have anything to do

81
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:16,640
because they have invested so much in a child who was sick and needed more attention

82
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:24,580
and they had a role, they had a mission to help the child, the child is better, it goes out.

83
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:39,380
-How do you handle the subject with antidoting through Acetic acid and Sulphur?

84
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,000
For example Sepia?

85
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:56,230
-Sepia it is said that she should avoid sour, vinegar or lemon.

86
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:08,010
Usually we advice to avoid, that is true but now in my experience

87
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:14,230
whether vinegar had antidoted, I cannot say.

88
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:20,890
Maybe, I remember one case that maybe she was using vinegar and we found out

89
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:25,240
that she had to be careful with vinegar, yes.

90
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:35,710
But it is not something which I specifically believe.

91
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:46,800
The problem is that you have a relapse and then you search why there is a relapse

92
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,880
because the relapse is too soon.

93
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:56,970
And you find that she is using vinegar and somebody else has found it and then record it.

94
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:03,540
I'm not sure that in all cases of Sepia the use of vinegar will do the same thing.

95
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,790
I'm not sure. But as a precaution.

96
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:14,220
The same way with mint. I saw mint antidoting definitely a case of Nat mur.

97
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,950
Just that case. From that time onwards when I give Nat mur, I say don't use mint.

98
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:26,220
Some of my students they generalize it and said mint out.

99
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:32,220
It is not my instructions or experience.

100
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:38,630
-I have a question concerning Mercury corrosivus.

101
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:51,460
I had a case of Mercury corrosivus in my dental clinic years ago.

102
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:59,070
He was a case of juvenile periodontitis.

103
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:05,400
This is a disease which is not curable or treatable by orthodox medicine.

104
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:14,120
And the picture is that young people at the age around 18-25 lose their complete teeth

105
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:20,870
within 3-5 years. Unfortunately he received Mercury solubilis from a homeopath.

106
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:27,360
Could you imagine if he had received Mercury corrosivus that this losing of the teeth

107
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:35,690
could have been stopped?
-I don't think so.

108
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:45,630
There are certain diseases like juvenile diabetes that we cannot have real effect.

109
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,380
Like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, you don't expect.

110
00:13:53,800 --> 00:14:03,700
The Jakob Creutzfeldt disease, the spongoid encephalopathy,

111
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:08,950
you don't expect to have an effect with the homeopathic remedy.

112
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:13,040
These are end stages diseases.

113
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:19,970
Schizophrenia of 10-15 years, forget it.

114
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:49,210
And spastic children when after birth it brings the raise of bilirubin,

115
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:58,440
where they have to change the blood, they have to change the whole blood of the child

116
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:04,940
and then the child comes into a spasticity state, forget it.

117
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,940
You battle for years and you just improve a little bit.

118
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,710
These are diseases which you cannot have an effect.

119
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:19,450
And you may be battling and some effect will be there.

120
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:23,400
Like autistic children, you may be battling with some effect

121
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:29,790
but you will be disappointed in the end. You cannot bring around health.

122
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:40,860
-What is your feeling on homeopathic medicine and Chiropractic or Acupuncture?

123
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,610
Do they contradict one another?

124
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:48,360
-No they don't contradict, they can complement each other,

125
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:57,280
especially when the homeopathic treatment does not give further effects on a local problem,

126
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:05,610
which can be due to dislocation of a vertebrae or to a wrong position.

127
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:12,130
This can be complemented by chiropractic practice.

128
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:21,230
-Do you know what happened to the Indian baby girl who was treated with Agaricus 30?

129
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:26,200
And we had the follow up in Athens?

130
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:33,450
-I have long time since I did not have news and I have to write to them

131
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:36,450
to give me the latest news.

132
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:41,700
-I'm thinking of her because the case was extreme and you, yourself were surprised

133
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,380
by the treatment.

134
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:53,860
-I had predicted that such a case will improve. To what extend we don't know.

135
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,860
Because It was an amazing case for me also.

136
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:06,770
But the remedy was clear at that moment and I said OK let's see what happens.

137
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:12,780
And what happened it was very impressive because the epileptic fits stopped immediately.

138
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:21,780
And then she started developing slowly. I published exactly the letter as it was coming from India.

139
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:27,780
I do not have the latest report but as you reminded me I will have to write

140
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,380
to get the latest report.

141
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:39,190
But such cases you don't expect to bring them back to normality.

142
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:50,290
-If we took a remedy and after a while we have to make a stomatologic treatment?

143
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:52,790
-That's a problem.

144
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,290
-We repeat the remedy?

145
00:17:54,390 --> 00:18:04,870
-Because they use strong medication, especially for anesthesia which affects the system.

146
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:09,120
-What can we do?
-Nothing.

147
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,950
-We repeat the remedy?

148
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:19,960
-Oh yes afterwards either you repeat or many times there is no complete relapse,

149
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,560
so you don't know what to do actually.

150
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:30,310
-Also I want to ask if hemophilia is...
-Forget it.

151
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,980
-I want to ask you about Silica. I had a case two months ago of a young man

152
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:45,620
who was diagnosed 12 years ago with a big tumor in the colon.

153
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,880
They took the whole colon out and they connected the large intestine to the rectum

154
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,880
or the tube and Silica came to my mind.

155
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:57,660
What is your experience with Silica, as far as rejecting the foreign body,

156
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:03,220
like the tube of the colon or the tube..?
-You may do it.

157
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,870
-Let's say he needs a Silica, what you will do or what you will give?

158
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:20,640
-I will think it twice before I give it or you give it in very low potency like 6X

159
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:26,980
in the beginning to see how it will develop.

160
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:33,390
-Generally Silica can reject all foreign bodies like the silicon breast?

161
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:35,230
-Yes.

162
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:41,380
-Then what do you do? How you approach that?

163
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:51,230
-I said you give it very low 6X and see how the organism is doing.

164
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:56,470
You don't give a big shock like 200 or 1M.

165
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:05,290
-I have a question about a patient who had a bypass surgery and he's had a mess screen

166
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:13,790
implanted in the aorta in one of the larger veins.

167
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:16,800
-What is a mess screen?

168
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:25,540
-The doctors feel that it may be from aneurysm and so they have implanted a mess screen

169
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,150
like mosquitoes.

170
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:33,040
-A kind of a net to support the artery.

171
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:46,370
-That's correct. This patient has had a stroke and he is severely involved after the surgery.

172
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:52,460
It is a complicated case but the question I have is this mess screen

173
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:58,370
that they have implanted I think 5-6 years ago, the stroke happened 1 1/2 year ago,

174
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:05,790
it is made of titanium and it is shown to the wall of the artery.

175
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:12,630
The remedy that I have come up with initially is Silica and I'm wondering if I can give Silica

176
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:19,380
without possibly disturbing the screen and if the Silica will cause the screen

177
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,710
to be rejected by the body?

178
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:34,360
-I don't think that there is any problem with the screen because the screen

179
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:43,890
just keeps the artery open. It doesn't interfere with the function really of the heart.

180
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:50,960
So I don't think it will be any problem with that. You can go ahead and give it.

181
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:57,000
The problem which I see is whether you will have any effect or not. That's another story.

182
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:10,200
-I don't know about Europe but in America everybody is taking Prozac.

183
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,490
Women, children, everybody is taking Prozac.

184
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:32,280
-It's an antidepressive remedy, which there was a big article on Times magazine

185
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:44,020
or Newsweek three weeks ago, which shows that there are a lot of side effects,

186
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:49,640
especially affecting the sexuality.

187
00:22:52,480 --> 00:23:00,970
It goes into pieces, you don't have it anymore, you get rid of it and so it's better.

188
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:13,880
Some people say it's OK, some they say no, out with Prozac.

189
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:24,370
My idea is that if you give a powerful chemical drug which affects the brain

190
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:29,040
definitely it's not only the hormonal disturbances that they create.

191
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:36,540
They create a generalized disturbance which they will find out most probably

192
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:43,280
that it'll catch the expectancy of life or whatever other problems,

193
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:52,740
cancer or heart problems that they may develop together with the hormonal disturbances.

194
00:23:52,840 --> 00:24:02,950
Hormonal disturbances are quite immediate and quite obvious and that's why they record them.

195
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:10,560
What about other subtle effects on the long run? We don't know.

196
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:24,400
But you see the problem is, as I see it, that we make a population

197
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:29,230
which is on a massive depression.

198
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:37,210
Because otherwise you don't need to take Prozac, unless you are on a depression state.

199
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:49,620
And also craziness because these people have anxieties and fears.

200
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,630
They resort to this kind of medication.

201
00:24:55,810 --> 00:25:01,980
The extends to which is prescribed it shows the problem that we have created

202
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,550
in the western world.

203
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:12,290
Because these remedies are not needed by Asians, are not needed by South Americans,

204
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:15,640
are not needed by the Africans.

205
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:23,130
They are needed only for the white population, that is going crazy more and more.

206
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:32,280
The same idea was in America with the psychoanalysis.

207
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:39,780
Everyone had to have a psychoanalyst or a psychotherapist or a psychologist

208
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:49,530
to support him or her. Almost everyone. They could not live unless this is my psychotherapy.

209
00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:03,540
For us, Greeks when we hear about this, in the beginning I remember back in 1960

210
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:09,030
when I heard about this I thought Americans they are all crazy.

211
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:19,470
What do they do with the psychotherapist? What do they say?

212
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:26,380
Of course now a lot of Athenians need psychotherapy as well.

213
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:42,310
-I think often needs are waken by advertisement for example or by giving certain offers.

214
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:48,080
They have to eradicate every slight discomfort or every tiny little fear they have

215
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:53,930
and I believe actually it's normal to have fears once in a while or something else.

216
00:26:55,420 --> 00:27:06,590
-That is also true that advertising has inflated the problem but the problem exists.

217
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:14,240
Go to India and do the advertising or to South Americans, they will not pay attention.

218
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:20,750
Here also in Greece there is this advertising but they don't pay attention.

219
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:32,080
In America of course there is the need, that's why they say it makes me feel good.

220
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,320
-I have two questions. First of all I want to come back to what you said this morning

221
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:48,830
concerning the Repertory that there are too many rubrics and too many remedies in every rubric.

222
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:59,580
Wouldn't be very interesting to collect your experience and to publish a new Repertory?

223
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:08,900
-What I will try to do, I will try to do this.

224
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:16,150
Because there is somebody who has offered to subsidize such a project.

225
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:22,910
There are some people, especially in Germany, who are very hard working

226
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:31,650
and very meticulous and I have some ideas concerning the Repertory.

227
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:46,980
I collect also Karim who spoke about the Repertory. Karim is one of the team I'm thinking.

228
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:55,010
I'm thinking of another two persons from Germany, myself and Schroyens,

229
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:58,990
the one who collected the information about the Repertory.

230
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:06,730
We make a team and I have invited them already to decide on certain guidelines

231
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:11,090
that we have to follow to make a new Repertory.

232
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:19,480
This idea actually I have put into action by writing letters, communicating with these people,

233
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:26,970
and trying to bring them together and together with the finance here,

234
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:31,580
who will finance such a project?

235
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,080
And we see if we can do a better Repertory.

236
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:48,140
It's absolutely necessary to clear the Repertory and this Synthesis is now quite good

237
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,240
but not good enough.

238
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:57,150
And if they keep on taking information as it's just produced, it's no good.

239
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:02,170
We have to screen the information and we have to evaluate the information.

240
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:05,400
We have to have a team that can do that.

241
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:12,400
They have the knowledge and the energy to do this screening.

242
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:19,470
So I try from all points of view and of course I work but I can try

243
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:32,080
that maybe in a few years time we may have a better Repertory.

244
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:38,070
But it is necessary absolutely, the same way like the Materia Medica.

245
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:41,280
I'm writing the Materia Medica. You think the Materia Medica,

246
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:45,820
ah George has it all in his mind, he sits down and writes the Materia Medica.

247
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:56,480
Neither it's possible for any brain to see whether this symptom can belong to that remedy,

248
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,820
yes or no?

249
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:03,610
You remember when I was writing some other symptoms of another remedy,

250
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:09,590
I said to myself what the hell, it doesn't fit with that remedy.

251
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:15,840
Then I said to you forget about what I'm saying and then you will find it in the Repertory,

252
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,180
if you remember that comment.

253
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:29,450
Because this symptom doesn't fit with the nature of this remedy.

254
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:34,510
But who can do all that for every symptom? There is no brain

255
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:37,860
who can know all this information by heart.

256
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:50,490
So we need a system that you get a cured case that confirms that symptom which is there.

257
00:31:50,590 --> 00:32:00,760
OK you take this or you need two cases because it has been confirmed by a clinical experience.

258
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:10,100
To do that do you know how much research and hours you need? Fantastic.

259
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,490
And then they say why don't you write the Materia Medica?

260
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:27,100
The Materia Medica in English has sold 400 copies. Let's say I get 10%.

261
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:37,170
How much do you think I have spent in research and doing these 150 remedies I did so far

262
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:45,480
and the Royalties that you get from such a project? It's nothing.

263
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,100
So you need to subsidize.

264
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:57,370
Of course by the School we subsidize the different other activities but you cannot do it indefinitely.

265
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:15,260
-I would like to come back to these horrible publications we find in Germany

266
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,190
and in different countries.

267
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:25,430
Wouldn't it be advisable to have some Public Relations Offices in these countries

268
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:32,280
to somewhat control these publications?

269
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:41,180
-Unfortunately you can't do that because we are a free planet, free countries.

270
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,440
Anybody can publish anything he likes.

271
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:50,350
-I know but we should respond immediately. And you can't do it by yourself, it's too much.

272
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:53,610
There are so many publications and we should respond immediately

273
00:33:53,710 --> 00:34:00,460
and put our own articles into these newspapers. To try.

274
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:09,600
-Yes but always you need some people who will devote their time and energy

275
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:17,940
into doing that and these people will have the repercussions of all those who believe...

276
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:32,330
They say why don't we prove a song? We play a music here and then we have our impression

277
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:35,510
of what is the proving the song.

278
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:40,320
Somebody says it's a good idea, why not?

279
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:46,680
And I say for god shake this is going to destroy and to kill Homeopathy.

280
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:54,580
The people who believe in proving a song, they say you are so closed and start attacking.

281
00:34:54,680 --> 00:35:01,410
And then I have to sit down and write again by arguments why I said this.

282
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:08,610
-I don't mean this, also the media in general.

283
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,990
-Yes these are important. That's why I have written all the answers.

284
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:20,740
-Yes but you can't do it by yourself, it's too much.

285
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:30,170
-That is true but you have to take action. Once you see that immediately you write a letter.

286
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:43,190
In the German newspapers this chronic headache article killed Homeopathy in Germany.
