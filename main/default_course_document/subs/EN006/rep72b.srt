1
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:37,160
It is a problem, I admitted and we'll talk now about the possible solutions, the possible tools that are there to find back information.

2
00:00:38,645 --> 00:00:46,460
First of all you are aware that the Repertory is structured chapters within a chapter, alphabetical. They have modalities, extensions and all that, you know all this.

3
00:00:46,560 --> 00:01:04,203
I don't have to explain to you that the goal of the structure of the Repertory is to find back information. I will leave this unless you have questions.

4
00:01:05,547 --> 00:01:29,355
The second way to help Repertory users to find back information it is the standardized language.

5
00:01:31,253 --> 00:01:38,976
By this we mean that if you are speaking and you have a symptom while speaking, it will not be entered like this in the Repertory.

6
00:01:40,384 --> 00:01:51,563
But it will be entered like talking. In the Repertory we don't speak, we talk. Do you understand what I'm trying to say?

7
00:01:52,800 --> 00:02:01,600
The number of words are limited, we don't use all the synonyms of speaking. We always use talking.

8
00:02:03,061 --> 00:02:18,997
Another example, when something is improved by a position, an action, we say ... amel. We don't say ... I'm better by, relieved by, no. We say ... amel.

9
00:02:20,064 --> 00:02:26,464
So the language is standardized.

10
00:02:28,107 --> 00:02:37,429
In Kent's Repertory the language is less standardized and with each subsequent version of Synthesis, we have (?) lines, the language of the Repertory, a little bit more.

11
00:02:38,731 --> 00:02:48,032
And we can (?) even more, we have to do it. But it is such a big task that it is an ongoing task.

12
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:56,757
So far this is the job of the one who inserts the symptoms.

13
00:02:59,403 --> 00:03:11,477
But then for the people who search, we have different possibilities really on the level of language and the first, as you know, are the synonyms.

14
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:22,272
So abandoned is a synonym to forsaken. You see it on the screen.

15
00:03:23,253 --> 00:03:38,293
It means we don't add remedies, we don't (?) rubrics to abandoned whenever we want to express something about abandoned. We will add it to forsaken because within Repertory context abandoned and forsaken are the same.

16
00:03:38,763 --> 00:03:53,056
Obviously there will always be someone who says, yes but abandoned and forsaken, for me there is a difference because if the person is forsaken, it is more deep wounds and....

17
00:03:53,675 --> 00:04:05,536
It will be an explanation but in general we try to have synonyms and I would even say, we try to have more and more synonyms, not to differentiate too much.

18
00:04:06,368 --> 00:04:13,771
Because otherwise you become too dependent upon finding the right words.

19
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:24,309
But I must admit that in fact it is a matter of discussion, a matter of taste almost whether two words are considered synonymous or not.

20
00:04:25,141 --> 00:04:37,792
And if they are not considered synonymous, they are what we call cross references.

21
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:49,703
Jealousy and envy are cross references. Maybe some people say, jealous, envious is more or less the same. They would put it as a synonym.

22
00:04:49,803 --> 00:04:58,613
But in Repertory language which is a little bit different from the natural language, I must say, you know we have defined a difference between jealousy and envy.

23
00:04:59,787 --> 00:05:09,984
Can anyone explain to me, jealousy and envy?

24
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:23,222
-I don't know if I'm correct but maybe jealousy is more towards lover or something like that and envy is

25
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:28,123
if you see somebody who has nice things and you are jealous about that. That is what I would think.

26
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,036
-Yes it's perfect. Jealous is on an emotional level and envy is on a material level.

27
00:05:35,136 --> 00:05:42,624
So we make a clear distinction between jealousy and envy. But they are cross references because sometimes it goes together

28
00:05:42,724 --> 00:05:50,112
sometimes you may want to combine rubrics into one, new, big rubric etc.

29
00:05:56,107 --> 00:06:16,992
In the Repertory you see, if you are positioned on abandoned in Radar, it is just efficient to hit "enter" once on your keyboard, to hit it and you will jump to forsaken.

30
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:26,507
So I hit and I am in forsaken in the Repertory. So you jump.

31
00:06:30,091 --> 00:06:35,979
This time I will speak with English because I must use language examples.

32
00:06:39,243 --> 00:06:47,015
The same way if you see a cross reference, I hope you are aware that forsaken feeling, you want to look at desire for company

33
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:55,095
you click on desire company twice, left click and you are at desire company.

34
00:06:56,907 --> 00:07:05,856
So there are jumps in the book, as you see more easy in the software, to jump to different places to reflect on the remedies on the meaning

35
00:07:05,956 --> 00:07:14,805
and to decide for the correct rubric within the cross references and considering the synonyms.

36
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,923
So that's one level.

37
00:07:20,075 --> 00:07:29,489
Of course there is a problem because any symptom you want to search in the Repertory...

38
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:36,928
Suppose you have the book, only the book, what is the first thing you need to do?

39
00:07:37,803 --> 00:07:52,757
It is to decide in which chapter it is. Sometimes it is easy, if I have itching in my ear, I must look in my nose and vice versa.

40
00:07:53,184 --> 00:07:59,712
But sometimes it is really difficult and it is almost  arbitrary decision in which chapter it is (?).

41
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:16,401
So we are dependent upon the structure, chapters etc., alphabet, modalities and so on to find the symptom and here there is a function which is available in all the homeopathic soft wares

42
00:08:16,501 --> 00:08:23,328
that you can search symptom with keywords.

43
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:39,243
Keywords mean the word which is a key. So the (?) you were storing and you take out the word which is a key.

44
00:08:40,352 --> 00:08:49,355
I will show you examples in English but it is exactly the same in German, you can try it for any German words.

45
00:08:50,464 --> 00:09:17,109
What you need to do, to use this tool in this program at least, you type a "?" and then you type for example the word "snoring".

46
00:09:17,621 --> 00:09:31,381
Because your mother in law is snoring all the time and you don't know if you have to go and look in the rubric "nose" or (?) or "minds ailments from" or whatever.

47
00:09:31,936 --> 00:09:38,955
You don't know where to look for snoring. But you know the keyword is "snoring".

48
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:58,411
So you type "? snoring" and then you get a list of 9 symptoms and you see that there is a big symptom with 59 remedies which (?) its presence in the chapter "respiration".

49
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:06,901
So find a symptom using one word.

50
00:10:08,864 --> 00:10:16,392
I give another example. You remember this morning I couldn't find the symptom and everybody was looking at me

51
00:10:16,492 --> 00:10:23,920
and I got very nervous and so I didn't find the symptom, I must say.

52
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:32,843
But I knew the symptom existed. So I can use the same tool to find the symptom.

53
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:43,531
(?) Arsenicum, yes I know Arsenicum better is another remedy which has the symptom in a very prominent way and it is (?) a little bit different.

54
00:10:44,440 --> 00:11:14,421
So what I will do, I type"?", I type "death" and (?). At this moment the program will find for me all the symptoms which contain the word "death" all along, wherever they are in the structure of the Repertory.

55
00:11:18,795 --> 00:11:36,672
And then you see 5 symptoms. The first starts of "death when alone". And this is the remedy I wanted you to find.

56
00:11:45,867 --> 00:12:04,988
-We have another way to come to this result. We always did it, it's better your way. When you click on this icon...

57
00:12:05,088 --> 00:12:23,627
-So Miriam was clicking on an icon when she was in Israel. Now that she has been in Alonissos she will type the "?" because she feels it is better.

58
00:12:25,163 --> 00:12:35,403
If you find something better, change it. Someone likes to click on icons, she can click on icons.

59
00:12:37,728 --> 00:12:42,940
-I don't understand how I get to the"?" You just put it in or you have ...

60
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,429
-You type the "?"
-Without anything else?

61
00:12:54,389 --> 00:13:07,381
-When you type the "?" this appears. That's just the way it works.

62
00:13:09,429 --> 00:13:16,720
So a word to find a symptom. Be careful because I'm going to ask you a question after that.

63
00:13:18,688 --> 00:13:26,009
We go on a step further. So the keyword search is a very big step forward

64
00:13:26,109 --> 00:13:33,329
it is related to the homeopathic soft wares or in a way also to some books like (?) Index of Repertory.

65
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:40,071
You know this book? Index of Repertory? It's a big book almost a Repertory by itself.

66
00:13:40,171 --> 00:13:45,205
It has keywords and behind every keyword all the pages where it appears.

67
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:53,227
Of course in the software when you see immediately the result, it is more easy.

68
00:13:54,400 --> 00:14:02,840
But the keyword "search" in the Repertory and the software does it, it is a very big step forward because we don't need to structure anymore.

69
00:14:03,787 --> 00:14:10,485
We can find the symptom regardless of the structure.

70
00:14:11,701 --> 00:14:15,627
The next step to help you find symptoms is that we were aware that with the synonyms

71
00:14:15,727 --> 00:14:19,552
with more cross references, with the keyword search, with grammatical synonyms

72
00:14:32,501 --> 00:14:40,608
with the general language synonyms etc., still more tools are needed to find the symptoms.

73
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:57,781
And that's why we introduced, related to Synthesis this time, about 2-3 years ago, concepts.

74
00:15:03,349 --> 00:15:22,016
A concept is an idea and it is like a box. In the concepts in the box are the Repertory symptoms which express the idea; then it's a concept.

75
00:15:22,848 --> 00:15:28,224
So you have a concept in many ways, in many different ways.

76
00:15:29,056 --> 00:15:36,849
I will not expand very much and let to discover it yourself, after this and just give a few examples.

77
00:15:42,005 --> 00:15:58,219
Someone asked about pregnancy. Restructure the Repertory and make a chapter "pregnancy". Well, it is possible to do it but with concepts we have another tool.

78
00:15:59,051 --> 00:16:10,961
Because is like a spider web above the Repertory which holds together symptoms from very different parts, very different meaning

79
00:16:11,061 --> 00:16:16,721
made it much more apart than the cross references.

80
00:16:16,821 --> 00:16:24,395
In a cross reference you have two symptoms which are related; in a concept you may have a lot of symptoms which are not related at all

81
00:16:24,821 --> 00:16:29,749
among each other but only do belong to the same idea.

82
00:16:30,267 --> 00:16:37,643
I will give you few examples so that you understand more easily.

83
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:50,919
To have access to the keywords, we use one "?". To have access to the concepts we use two "??"

84
00:16:51,019 --> 00:16:55,584
We did it especially for the people from Israel.

85
00:16:56,736 --> 00:17:15,872
So I type two ?? pregnancy and then I get a list of concepts, as you see, by Zulian and by Fonseca there is a concept "pregnancy".

86
00:17:16,853 --> 00:17:31,595
And if I click on the little book here which is an icon for Synthesis, I will see all the symptoms that are related to pregnancy.

87
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:39,836
Anger during pregnancy, anxiety-pregnancy, aversion company-pregnancy, delirium after abortion...

88
00:17:39,936 --> 00:17:44,337
So the word pregnancy doesn't need to be present all the time.

89
00:17:44,437 --> 00:17:48,945
Despair during delivery again is not the word search, it is not a keyword search.

90
00:17:49,045 --> 00:18:00,608
Fear from threatening abortion and sadness after disappearance of milk.

91
00:18:02,187 --> 00:18:10,955
You see the symptoms is not with the presence of the word pregnancy. It is just anything which has to do with pregnancy.

92
00:18:11,808 --> 00:18:17,547
So that's we call the ID, the concept pregnancy.

93
00:18:19,552 --> 00:18:27,445
It's one example of the concepts. The concept can be used for other very interesting points.

94
00:18:28,427 --> 00:18:38,261
Maybe you have in your family someone who has the disease of Alzheimer.

95
00:18:39,755 --> 00:18:51,019
It is difficult to use it in homeopathic way. It would be easier to say there is rubric generals Alzheimer, 25 remedies.

96
00:18:51,957 --> 00:19:01,479
But do you believe, as a well trained homeopath, that it is so easy that you just go and look at the 25 remedies of Alzheimer, you give it and it's fixed?

97
00:19:04,565 --> 00:19:16,021
You have to take the case and be more precise. So these are homeopathic symptoms which may apply, if you use Alzheimer.

98
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:33,344
So I type ??Alzheimer which means I search for the idea, for the concept Alzheimer and then the program shows me here

99
00:19:34,176 --> 00:19:53,681
a box; I click on it and I see 24 symptoms throughout the Repertory, mind and others, speech indistinct. Ah yes, OK.

100
00:19:53,781 --> 00:20:02,912
So you find the homeopathic symptoms which you did not know about when you were considering Alzheimer.

101
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:18,848
Like this, we have in the Radar concepts180 different diseases and each disease is a concept, a box and contains 10,20, 30, 40 symptoms

102
00:20:19,701 --> 00:20:25,355
which are interesting to think of or to question about, when you have a case with that disease.

103
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:37,329
So these are the concepts of  diseases, just to give another example what a concept can be.

104
00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:49,675
So there is this spider web Alzheimer disease and throughout the Repertory it takes all the symptoms related to Alzheimer.

105
00:20:57,717 --> 00:21:09,800
-From which version does it work?
-7 onwards.

106
00:21:21,589 --> 00:21:30,592
Anyway on the technical side I will look in the break. Let me first explain you the idea of concepts and this new access to Repertory.

107
00:21:33,515 --> 00:21:40,839
These are the different concepts, the Radar and acute diseases I explained to you.

108
00:21:51,392 --> 00:22:05,792
We have Fonseca concepts. I will explain Fonseca concepts. Two Brazilian people they have done huge work on minds.

109
00:22:06,624 --> 00:22:12,647
Often it is difficult to find back the correct mind symptom.

110
00:22:12,747 --> 00:22:17,063
What they did, they have different approaches but I will speak about analogic group.

111
00:22:17,163 --> 00:22:28,192
They divided basically all the mind symptoms into 3 analogical groups, concepts.

112
00:22:29,173 --> 00:22:40,032
One group, all mind symptoms related to others, all mind symptoms related to the person himself and all mind symptoms related to the environment.

113
00:22:41,056 --> 00:22:47,776
So you are searching for a mental symptom, even you don't know the word you have to search for, so keyword search you don't know.

114
00:22:48,843 --> 00:23:04,288
But you know that this symptom is related to the person himself. So you select the concept, the box "mental symptoms related to himself".

115
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:13,803
You go down one step and in this box you have another series of boxes, sub-concepts.

116
00:23:24,491 --> 00:23:31,111
We are in Synthesis, I will explain how to start this go into this Repertory.

117
00:23:37,312 --> 00:23:50,475
Search and at the bottom you have Find Concepts. I miss the nice icons but anyway.

118
00:23:55,019 --> 00:24:12,661
So I select Fonseca. Search, Find Concepts, here you are and I'm going back in my analogical group, related to himself.

119
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:20,412
Then they have created sub-concepts, the groups of symptoms related to the person oneself.

120
00:24:20,512 --> 00:24:28,533
death, health, intellect... etc. I will just give you an example to see how it works.

121
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,324
I just click on the choice I make.

122
00:24:35,424 --> 00:24:47,392
So if the symptom is related to himself, I click on related to himself.

123
00:24:49,464 --> 00:24:55,669
-I don't understand how did you get this one? I just got analogical, illusions...

124
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:11,819
-You click on analogical groups. To get something you must click on it. It's a very important rule on all computer programs.

125
00:25:12,331 --> 00:25:22,208
Select the word, click on it. That is in word processors. In Radar, you want information about something, click on it.

126
00:25:24,939 --> 00:25:35,733
Anyway to get the analogical groups, you click on it. To get all those related to himself, click on it.

127
00:25:36,331 --> 00:25:46,144
Then there is a group, for example self-esteem, it is a symptom related to self-esteem

128
00:25:46,699 --> 00:25:55,253
and you see again a group of sub-boxes, it is low self-esteem, it is egotism, it can be hyper or hypo

129
00:25:55,723 --> 00:25:57,152
so it has divided the whole mind in concepts and sub-concepts.

130
00:25:59,051 --> 00:26:08,032
And you can scroll down, step down in the hierarchy, you go to low self-esteem

131
00:26:08,132 --> 00:26:17,013
for example discontented with himself, self-depreciation and then you have no more boxes.

132
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:30,795
Then you say OK and then you get the box of self-depreciation and you have a list of 16 Repertory symptoms which express self-depreciation.

133
00:26:31,733 --> 00:26:39,548
You knew about anger about mistakes and anger with himself, maybe you had in your mind discontented with himself

134
00:26:39,648 --> 00:26:56,352
because it's a big rubric but when you scroll down you see quarrelsome with herself and interesting a symptom I never saw before, sadness, feeling superfluous.

135
00:26:58,677 --> 00:27:06,869
But it is part of the concept and so this is the way I can find the symptom which was completely unknown to me, even the words were unknown to me.

136
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:13,745
I have a related idea and with the concepts I get there.

137
00:27:13,845 --> 00:27:27,584
Still let's move on. You say, superfluous feeling that is very close but maybe you want to find out if you can find a symptom which is still closer.

138
00:27:28,843 --> 00:27:40,412
If you need an idea, you click on the bulb and you get another interesting idea

139
00:27:40,512 --> 00:27:48,113
because here you arrived at the rubric sadness, superfluous feeling and we see that it is related to a number of concepts

140
00:27:49,472 --> 00:28:00,757
the ones we just looked at, low self-esteem, etc. but also responsibility commitments.

141
00:28:01,675 --> 00:28:08,800
And you want to look maybe at the other symptoms of responsibility.

142
00:28:09,632 --> 00:28:28,683
And then you find 23 symptoms which are now related to superfluous in some way and you decide that finally the real symptom is dullness for cares for his business.

143
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:39,520
So it is not one web which is over the Repertory but a lot of spider webs, really scary, you know?

144
00:28:40,736 --> 00:28:48,693
And you can jump from one web to another. You just have to remember you click on the bulb, it brings you into the concepts.

145
00:28:50,123 --> 00:28:55,712
You click on the Synthesis icon, it brings you to the Repertory symptoms of the concepts.

146
00:28:56,565 --> 00:29:00,512
And like this you can scroll through the Repertory.

147
00:29:01,493 --> 00:29:08,128
Before I give you a little exercise, are they any questions about this?

148
00:29:11,093 --> 00:29:16,661
Then we will go ahead immediately with the exercise.

149
00:29:17,667 --> 00:29:24,832
-I (?) up the Radar 7.3 and therefore I can't do anything of that.

150
00:29:25,515 --> 00:29:27,605
-You better go home.

151
00:29:28,437 --> 00:29:32,021
-No, I mean I'm saying maybe it's the case of other people.
-Anyway.

152
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:46,400
The point is this is available from version 7 onwards. But for the exercise I will give you, you can use all these.

153
00:29:46,997 --> 00:29:52,352
Those who have concepts they will be delighted to play around with concepts but of course if you don't have it, what can I say?

154
00:29:53,035 --> 00:30:01,995
I can only say that we have developed I believe about 3000 different concepts, 3000 different spider webs over the Repertory

155
00:30:03,445 --> 00:30:08,672
and once you know how to use it, it's really fantastic.

156
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:26,037
How did I get it? Where did I come from? I click on the bulb, so in the Radar it's easy you click on a bulb to have an idea

157
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:30,780
you click on Synthesis icon to have Repertory symptoms. That's the basics.

158
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:43,445
-... who has all the program, is there a possibility to fill it up with new things or each one just (?) and stuck with the old version?

159
00:30:44,192 --> 00:30:56,508
-Never believe your dead ended. What we call it in this case of technical computer, to not believe that your dead ended is called upgrade.

160
00:30:56,608 --> 00:31:01,963
So you can upgrade.

161
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:12,309
This is a nice feature. I will give you now an exercise about finding the symptoms in the Repertory, even if you just have the book you can do the exercise.

162
00:31:13,397 --> 00:31:19,392
I just tell you what is available now today, I think it's a big jump forward for helping people to find symptoms

163
00:31:19,492 --> 00:31:25,387
but whatever means you have, now you will start to find the symptom.

164
00:31:32,149 --> 00:31:44,224
You imagine someone you know very well, a child, you mother in law, a neighbor, your boss...

165
00:31:44,971 --> 00:31:53,824
and what you need to know about this person, is a fear, a fear they have.

166
00:31:54,891 --> 00:31:58,837
So they tell you a story... I'm afraid.... but it must be concrete, you must know the person, you must not just imagine

167
00:32:03,403 --> 00:32:13,408
because (?) will be to interrogate you about the fear of, say your child.

168
00:32:14,155 --> 00:32:27,232
What I would like you to do and you can help each other is to find the one or maybe two or three rubrics which express this fear in a Repertory language.

169
00:32:28,683 --> 00:32:37,749
And if you come across a fear or an aspect of the fear, which you say I don't know where to find it in the Repertory

170
00:32:37,849 --> 00:32:42,187
you write it down and it will be a question.

171
00:32:44,363 --> 00:32:56,224
But now please imagine a person, you know pretty well, he/she is afraid, it is afraid maybe an animal, why not

172
00:32:57,035 --> 00:33:05,760
and then you express the fear and Betty has to find exactly the Repertory symptoms.

173
00:33:06,955 --> 00:33:13,760
Anya asks to give a difficult fear, not just fear of dark.

174
00:33:18,069 --> 00:33:27,051
You have to tell a story, the story of the fear. I have a child and it's afraid of the dark and I find a rubric fear of dark, that's not what I'm talking about.

175
00:33:30,763 --> 00:33:58,283
One last thing before you start doing this, be aware that in the Repertory fears are not only present in the chapter fear but also in delusions and anxiety and cares etc.

176
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,981
So if it is too easy, it depends upon you.

177
00:34:07,072 --> 00:34:18,129
What I would like to do is to run through the whole quickly. You give a story and you say 1,2,3 Repertory symptoms.

178
00:34:18,229 --> 00:34:36,305
First the story, then 1,2,3 Repertory symptoms. So the patient tells a story, you go to the Repertory and you say, maybe it is fear of water (?) of the Repertory rubric.

179
00:34:36,405 --> 00:34:48,800
You must imagine fear of water, you go back to the (?) and you say, is it fear of water? Is the story of my patient congruent with the symptom in the Repertory?

180
00:34:49,909 --> 00:35:03,605
I step into my next topic which is selecting the correct symptoms, so one point of selecting the correct symptom is the symptom should be congruent.

181
00:35:04,672 --> 00:35:13,440
Which means the Repertory symptom should express exactly what the patient is telling you and by preference not more but also not less.

182
00:35:14,357 --> 00:35:19,669
So fear of water is not exactly what the patient is saying.

183
00:35:20,736 --> 00:35:26,197
Now you can do Repertory search, you see there are cross-references to fear of drinking, fear of liquids, hydrophobia.

184
00:35:27,392 --> 00:35:33,398
As far as I know, there is so far no rubric in the Repertory which specifies the fear when the head is under the water

185
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:39,403
so you could say that for the moment the fear of water is the best match.

186
00:35:41,088 --> 00:35:53,056
But be aware that it is not the perfect match. It's only close and don't emphasize too much this rubric in your analysis because it is not congruent.

187
00:35:54,272 --> 00:36:05,472
If we reflect on which symptoms to take to repertorize, the first criteria is they must be congruent.

188
00:36:10,592 --> 00:36:16,949
So this is another topic that you gave me a nice occasion to speak about it.

189
00:36:17,739 --> 00:36:22,844
Another Repertory symptom ...

190
00:36:22,944 --> 00:36:40,715
-(?) in a big company and sometimes he has to talk in public and he has a very big fear speaking to public but when he has to speak he can do it.

191
00:36:43,637 --> 00:36:47,719
So it's fear of speaking in public but capable.

192
00:36:47,819 --> 00:36:52,277
-And what is the Repertory symptom?

193
00:36:53,429 --> 00:37:05,717
-Fear of speaking in public but capable.

194
00:37:24,021 --> 00:37:37,440
-Can you repeat exact symptom because it is not like this...

195
00:37:38,272 --> 00:37:45,852
-You see what I did? Have you been following what I did? I'm sorry I went fast but I will repeat slowly.

196
00:37:46,016 --> 00:37:56,839
She was giving the syntax of a symptom, I typed it, I didn't find it. So somewhere it was not correct to the structure of the Repertory. Problem.

197
00:37:56,939 --> 00:38:08,053
I search for the symptom regardless of the structure of the Repertory, I made a keyword search on the word ?public.

198
00:38:10,507 --> 00:38:17,980
And then it tells me there is fear appearing in public and stage freight etc.

199
00:38:19,467 --> 00:38:26,535
so fear appearing in public is the closest one, then I say OK interesting  and I see there is a

200
00:38:26,635 --> 00:38:31,755
cross-reference towards timidity public. I click on the cross-reference

201
00:38:32,608 --> 00:38:40,693
and I see timidity about appearing in public, I look at the sub-rubrics and I find

202
00:38:41,248 --> 00:38:54,240
a sub-rubric timidity about appearing in public but capable to do so.

203
00:38:55,072 --> 00:39:00,619
So I use the search with the ? I jump with the cross-reference and I find within seconds the correct rubric.

204
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:08,064
This is the symptom related to your story. Thank you.

205
00:39:09,792 --> 00:39:14,060
Another story?

206
00:39:17,557 --> 00:39:30,492
-She related to me a grown-up lady who always wants people (?)

207
00:39:30,592 --> 00:39:38,705
She is a kind of a saint that everything she does is all right and she described it as a fear.

208
00:39:38,805 --> 00:39:48,625
So I first looked under fear opinion of others where I found Nux Vomica and Pulsatilla

209
00:39:48,725 --> 00:39:52,340
and I want to show you the different rubrics. It was simple in the Repertory to find it.

210
00:39:55,765 --> 00:40:03,943
Then I found the arrow showing to delusion appreciate which she is not

211
00:40:04,043 --> 00:40:13,201
and which Palladium, Platina, Pulsatilla and (?) and then was another arrow

212
00:40:13,301 --> 00:40:24,593
to lamenting appreciated because she is not and there I found the arrow to longing good opinion of others which is really

213
00:40:24,693 --> 00:40:28,348
what she described and goes only Palladium.

214
00:40:29,557 --> 00:40:32,081
But it was a nice way you find through the Repertory.

215
00:40:32,181 --> 00:40:38,119
So she used, she jumped through the Repertory using mainly cross-references

216
00:40:38,219 --> 00:40:42,599
One leap of correction in your reasoning, if I may, or something which could improve

217
00:40:42,699 --> 00:40:47,740
is in the story that keyword is not fear but is a good opinion.

218
00:40:49,504 --> 00:40:55,264
And if you would have searched for good opinion, you would have seen this symptom appearing immediately.

219
00:40:56,267 --> 00:41:02,197
But anyway you got there, you got in other way. So that's very nice.

220
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:09,664
One other story maybe?

221
00:41:20,032 --> 00:41:21,333
Tell the story.

222
00:41:22,592 --> 00:41:33,387
-I tried what you said to use the ? and say good opinion...

223
00:41:40,533 --> 00:41:44,907
-One more story someone?

224
00:42:04,085 --> 00:42:09,504
-I would like to know how to find the symptom fear of being buried alive?

225
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:18,492
-What is the keyword in the symptom?
Buried.

226
00:42:20,768 --> 00:42:30,432
So you type buried and within a second you see the symptom is not under fear but under delusion.

227
00:42:41,867 --> 00:42:50,912
In dreams, dreams being buried alive.

228
00:42:52,917 --> 00:43:00,213
To find symptoms, in fact to understand the patients you extract what is most important.

229
00:43:04,437 --> 00:43:13,141
These are some examples and I hope you found many more interesting with yourself about how to find symptoms in the Repertory.

230
00:43:15,104 --> 00:43:22,507
I will speak a second part of introduction to the VES.

231
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:29,504
This morning I have explained to the different repertorisation matters and I taught you basically what the VES does.

232
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:39,367
It considers all the different repertorization matters and in fact it considers all the different repertorization matters

233
00:43:39,467 --> 00:43:42,027
for each step you take at the same time, everything.

234
00:43:42,837 --> 00:43:51,435
It looks at the 11 symptoms, in every way and then gives a balanced suggestion.

235
00:43:53,461 --> 00:44:02,549
Before we get to some more explanation about the VES, there is one other step I must take you.

236
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:14,439
And it is that I must explain you a little bit more about the choice of the correct symptoms to repertorize.

237
00:44:17,589 --> 00:44:27,211
After you have found them, you can repertorize but first which symptoms are interesting, which symptoms are needed.

238
00:44:30,304 --> 00:44:44,199
And therefore I would like to remind you first that you were outside, down to the beach, at the restaurant

239
00:44:44,299 --> 00:44:49,760
and it was nice to be in the open air.

240
00:44:50,507 --> 00:44:56,764
Everybody likes the (?) together the four hours. So everybody wanted to be outside in the open air.

241
00:44:59,467 --> 00:45:05,717
Maybe some people went out already because they couldn't wait.

242
00:45:09,195 --> 00:45:13,824
In the simple story, do you know any symptom there?

243
00:45:18,389 --> 00:45:23,765
-Desire to be in the open air.

244
00:45:35,947 --> 00:45:45,525
-Impatience and also anticipation, waiting to be out.

245
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,288
-Desire to escape you mean.

246
00:45:55,829 --> 00:46:06,112
Anyway. Now the first point I want to make is that a symptom is only a symptom when it is a symptom.

247
00:46:07,755 --> 00:46:11,320
Do you understand this?

248
00:46:15,285 --> 00:46:28,256
So here you have the intensity and you have desire for open air and to some level all of us have a desire for open air

249
00:46:28,356 --> 00:46:30,439
which will be repeated in a few minutes.

250
00:46:32,053 --> 00:46:41,547
But for the desire for open air to be a symptom, it must be above a certain level.

251
00:46:42,677 --> 00:46:44,775
Otherwise it is not a symptom.

252
00:46:44,875 --> 00:46:52,780
So if you listen to a story, yes then we went outside and it was nice to be in the air and I looked at the sea

253
00:46:52,880 --> 00:47:01,195
and I made deep respiration... ah, a symptom, respiration, breathing deep, desires to make these deep respirations

254
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:10,773
be careful. It has to be above a certain level before you consider a symptom.

255
00:47:13,717 --> 00:47:22,880
A certain level. And it can not be defined, I can not say how much desire for open air you need because it is relative.

256
00:47:24,555 --> 00:47:36,480
It is relative to the heat in the room, the external circumstances and it is relative to your way of speaking to me.

257
00:47:38,656 --> 00:47:44,999
If you never say anything the whole time and then you say, now I'm going to the open air

258
00:47:45,099 --> 00:47:52,096
and desire for my open air, then for your story, for the way you express things

259
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:59,115
it is more a symptom than someone who speaks all the time and says I do this, I have an aversion for this...

260
00:48:00,139 --> 00:48:02,300
you have (?) of symptoms, you have to be very careful.

261
00:48:10,464 --> 00:48:14,268
So at a certain level what the patient says becomes a homeopathic symptom.

262
00:48:14,368 --> 00:48:17,184
It has to be above a certain level.

263
00:48:17,696 --> 00:48:23,804
So that is why very often during interrogation of George and anyone who is aware how he should take a case

264
00:48:27,339 --> 00:48:33,532
that symptoms (?) to be interesting, he says wait a minute, when did you do it? How often did you do it?

265
00:48:36,149 --> 00:48:39,612
And is it very important for you and what happens if you don't go in the open air?

266
00:48:39,712 --> 00:48:44,028
And you say, why I need to know all that? It's not in the Repertory.

267
00:48:44,128 --> 00:48:49,788
Desire open air one time the day, one time the week, one time an hour? No.

268
00:48:49,888 --> 00:48:54,396
It is to know if it is a symptom. That's the first step.

269
00:48:56,821 --> 00:49:04,401
So make sure was it only today, here that you had a desire to go in the open air and

270
00:49:04,501 --> 00:49:10,176
then at home you are always inside? You have a big garden but you sit inside because in fact you prefer to be in the house.

271
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:19,889
You must be careful to evaluate the intensity in a  way of a symptom.

272
00:49:19,989 --> 00:49:25,536
That is the second point.

273
00:49:30,549 --> 00:49:34,560
Is it a symptom?

274
00:49:36,779 --> 00:49:43,697
Now you have a symptom, you look in the Repertory and then something we touched already in the morning

275
00:49:45,141 --> 00:49:59,463
I will write here, you have a nice sub-rubric like, I take a very easy example, headache in the morning.

276
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:05,621
Because that's what the person tells you, I have a headache in the morning.

277
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,999
So will you take the sub-rubric or will you take headache?

278
00:50:09,099 --> 00:50:14,823
Let's say head pains stitching in the morning. Will you take head pains stitching morning or head pains stitching?

279
00:50:15,477 --> 00:50:17,703
Will you take the sub-rubric or the super rubric?

280
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:30,972
You can not say do this or that. But I can tell you first of all it depends upon the congruency.

281
00:50:31,072 --> 00:50:39,569
If you take the rubric head pains stitching in the morning, it means that the headache stitching in the morning

282
00:50:39,669 --> 00:50:43,601
is in the morning, almost every time.

283
00:50:43,701 --> 00:50:49,717
If you go back to your patient, you say is it every time in the morning? And he says yes, yes it's in the morning

284
00:50:50,272 --> 00:50:56,764
and also in the evening and when I sit in my car etc.

285
00:50:56,864 --> 00:51:00,028
It's not relevant to sub-rubric anymore.

286
00:51:00,128 --> 00:51:05,739
So you use the sub-rubric depending on the congruency.

287
00:51:06,741 --> 00:51:14,257
The second reason is the size. I don't know by heart how many remedies are in head pain stitching morning

288
00:51:14,357 --> 00:51:21,632
but suppose there is only 5 remedies.

289
00:51:22,229 --> 00:51:27,740
Then be careful because it may be more interesting to use head pain stitching, if this is really important

290
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:32,860
if it's all the time stitching, than the sub-rubric.

291
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:39,829
Because you have more remedies which cover that bit of information.

292
00:51:40,725 --> 00:51:43,072
So decide between the sub and the super rubric.

293
00:51:43,627 --> 00:51:47,808
Another reason to decide between the sub and the super rubric is, you work out the case

294
00:51:48,597 --> 00:51:56,277
and you find no relevant remedy at all. A way to get other choices is to replace

295
00:51:57,429 --> 00:52:06,972
the more detailed symptom with a less detailed symptom.

296
00:52:07,072 --> 00:52:11,025
Head pain stitching morning by head pain stitching.

297
00:52:12,427 --> 00:52:16,629
Jealousy during menstruation by jealousy.

298
00:52:49,184 --> 00:53:02,180
This brings me to my next point that you must be careful in the Repertorisation

299
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:08,192
not to have two similar rubrics.

300
00:53:09,664 --> 00:53:13,020
I will give an example.

301
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:19,761
If you would put head pain stitching and head pain stitching in the morning, it is better

302
00:53:19,861 --> 00:53:25,351
to make one combined rubric, out of this.

303
00:53:25,451 --> 00:53:28,587
So you create a new rubric which contains all remedies.

304
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:36,999
Because what happens otherwise in all the methods of analysis, including the VES in a way

305
00:53:37,099 --> 00:53:43,399
the remedies which appear in head pain stitching morning or jealousy during menses

306
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:50,380
probably, for some major part, are repeated in the super rubric.

307
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:55,445
And you emphasize these remedies too much. It's not really expanding.

308
00:53:56,789 --> 00:54:01,297
Because the (?) is two arguments. You have an argument for Pulsatilla because of jealousy

309
00:54:01,397 --> 00:54:05,799
and an argument for Pulsatilla because of jealousy during menses.

310
00:54:07,669 --> 00:54:15,463
So you make a combined rubric which holds all the remedies or the 1,2,3,4 sub-rubrics.

311
00:54:21,387 --> 00:54:28,860
One reason so far, the major reason why people find often two Carcinosinum, you know what it is?

312
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:37,735
It is this. And the rubrics they put too often, most of the time are even the same.

313
00:54:40,587 --> 00:54:51,623
Are the rubrics of food and Carcinosin is prominent in a few of very interesting food rubrics.

314
00:54:51,765 --> 00:54:58,549
So if you put food rubrics, it says what you like to eat. This and this and butter and eggs and meat and fat etc.

315
00:54:59,381 --> 00:55:05,620
You put all these and then a few more aversions because it says we must have an equilibrated repertorisation.

316
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:11,719
Not only 5 desires, 2 aversions and 1 aggravation, it is too much talk about food.

317
00:55:11,819 --> 00:55:17,713
Now you may like to talk about food but not in the repertorisation.

318
00:55:17,813 --> 00:55:29,397
If someone tells you 10, 15 symptoms about food, you must be very careful to select maybe 1 or 2 or 3 but not just put everything.

319
00:55:31,616 --> 00:55:38,257
And because people too often put these food rubrics, they get a lot of Carcinosinum.

320
00:55:38,357 --> 00:55:46,215
So eliminate or at least combine the desires for egg and meat and cheese and whatever

321
00:55:46,315 --> 00:55:51,036
which is protein, maybe in one rubric and the Carcinosinum will go down.

322
00:55:54,827 --> 00:56:07,249
-When I take a sub-rubric and combine them with a super rubric together, I have different degrees from the same remedy.

323
00:56:07,349 --> 00:56:13,607
Perhaps Sulphur in the morning, stitching pain one degree and super rubric three degrees

324
00:56:13,707 --> 00:56:17,973
and I change degree by combining them and I feel the intensity.

325
00:56:18,827 --> 00:56:29,415
-What happens with the degree is that the program, it takes the highest degree.

326
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:44,796
So be careful for too many similar rubrics. The point is not to have a lot of rubrics to cover the case but to have the relevant rubrics.

327
00:56:56,267 --> 00:57:06,592
-Could you please explain again how to do the combination, it would be with a, b or look for one symptom?

328
00:57:11,712 --> 00:57:16,540
-I will show it very quickly because again it's a bit technical.

329
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:31,132
I believe this is different in different programs. I will just choose an example at random.

330
00:57:33,621 --> 00:57:49,479
I have two symptoms, so not true combination but anyway. I select the two symptoms and then

331
00:57:49,579 --> 00:58:05,237
I add these added qualifications and I create a group which is indicated by a letter, for example A.

332
00:58:06,027 --> 00:58:11,440
And at this moment these two symptoms are considered as one symptom A.

333
00:58:12,171 --> 00:58:18,827
If you have a problem I prefer to explain to you in the break.

334
00:58:22,816 --> 00:58:29,131
How to select the correct symptoms for repertorisation?

335
00:58:33,824 --> 00:58:38,460
Yes, another important point. Maybe you have reflected while I was speaking this morning

336
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:46,780
when I told you how Kent was repertorising and maybe many of you are aware, if you use a book, how you are repertorising.

337
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:53,749
And if you are not aware, I will make you aware today.

338
00:58:54,624 --> 00:59:02,240
Do you know what you do? You listen to the patient and it tells you one thing after another

339
00:59:03,243 --> 00:59:22,343
and then he tells you I'm squandering my money.

340
00:59:22,443 --> 00:59:31,851
I say, interesting. Why? Because this is a rubric which has 20 remedies and I like it.

341
00:59:32,789 --> 00:59:38,407
Why do I like it? Because then I don't have too much work to compare between the remedies

342
00:59:38,507 --> 00:59:42,161
with the 50 remedies of the other rubric.

343
00:59:42,261 --> 00:59:49,436
This is what Kent did in the elimination. And the story goes on and you hear everything that he is telling

344
00:59:49,536 --> 00:59:53,632
and then he tells, fear of ghosts. Another one.

345
00:59:54,144 --> 01:00:06,759
Only 27 remedies, I can manage. And you take out of the story of the patient, not the relevant, let it be exact information

346
01:00:06,859 --> 01:00:10,507
but the information you can use to repertorize.

347
01:00:11,061 --> 01:00:14,304
And you have not seen that the patient was restless. Maybe you have seen it.

348
01:00:15,157 --> 01:00:19,253
But of course what can you do with restlessness, 450 remedies.

349
01:00:20,192 --> 01:00:31,377
So you ask him are you restless in the morning? He says, no, no all the time restless. Evening, day time, internal, outer restless.

350
01:00:31,477 --> 01:00:39,505
But are you restless when you are sitting down, here like today? No, no, restless sitting down, restless standing up

351
01:00:39,605 --> 01:00:45,329
restless walking around. No modality.

352
01:00:45,429 --> 01:00:52,263
What do all the working heroes do? You say we remember the restlessness, when we look at the picture

353
01:00:52,363 --> 01:00:56,181
but it does not go into the repertorisation.

354
01:00:56,501 --> 01:01:04,544
So even when it is the main feature, when it is a big, big feature, the restlessness, you don't use it in the repertorisation with the book.

355
01:01:05,291 --> 01:01:09,713
Now with the computer you can reason more correctly.

356
01:01:09,813 --> 01:01:31,047
If restlessness or whatever big rubric it is important, you use the big or the small rubric.

357
01:01:31,147 --> 01:01:37,340
And you say yes but this contains all the (?) that's why I don't do it this way.

358
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:43,477
Not correct. Just try to escape from hard labor.

359
01:01:46,912 --> 01:01:54,492
Because if we look at these famous 450 remedies of restlessness, what do we see?

360
01:01:54,592 --> 01:02:00,956
We do see the Anacardium, the Arsenicum, the Belladonna, the Camphora, the Calcarea etc.

361
01:02:01,056 --> 01:02:09,873
but we do see between the 450 remedies also Asarum, Asafoetida, Arum Triphyllum etc.

362
01:02:10,123 --> 01:02:18,300
So the small remedies are there and if you take this rubric in consideration in your repertorization

363
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:29,628
and there is another symptom of Arum Triphyllum, then the restlessness will help you to see that it is an Arum Triphyllum case.

364
01:02:34,336 --> 01:02:47,932
I have done, long ago, repertorisations by hand 20, 30, 40, 50 minutes because I was aware of this play we (?) on ourselves

365
01:02:48,032 --> 01:02:55,356
using the interesting rubrics for repertorization and skipping the reality.

366
01:02:56,288 --> 01:03:02,481
There is an advantage with the computer repertorizations, we can focus on what the patient really says

367
01:03:02,581 --> 01:03:05,461
we don't have to like at the size, in a way.

368
01:03:06,357 --> 01:03:14,023
If it is congruent, if it is not too much similar, if we have decided about modality yes or no

369
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:19,783
we can use the appropriate rubric regardless of the size.

370
01:03:19,883 --> 01:03:24,881
And it will even help to find a small remedy.

371
01:03:24,981 --> 01:03:29,873
Because for many of the small remedies you will read, if you go to the Materia Medica, they don't tell you

372
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:35,847
restlessness better when moving about, restlessness driving out of bed, we don't have all these modalities.

373
01:03:36,075 --> 01:03:41,244
So the small remedies are known to be very restless.

374
01:03:41,344 --> 01:03:47,957
Restless is one big feature of the remedy. And the other feature is weakness.

375
01:03:48,683 --> 01:03:53,995
Weakness in morning, evening, when drinking, eating, sleeping, playing golf, no weakness.

376
01:03:54,507 --> 01:03:59,569
It's a combination of weakness, exhaustion and restlessness.

377
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:11,979
What remedy are you thinking of? Arsenicum. Another possibility. Many other possibilities, many (?) will come out.

378
01:04:12,811 --> 01:04:23,697
But do you know this combination of restlessness and exhaustion, weakness, this combination is typical also for (?)

379
01:04:23,797 --> 01:04:33,084
(?) you will not find, find set modalities of restlessness and weakness but you will find that these two big issues

380
01:04:33,184 --> 01:04:40,849
restlessness and nervous exhaustion in combination are typical for (?)

381
01:04:49,803 --> 01:04:55,115
But it will show many remedies, it will need one more symptom.

382
01:04:57,803 --> 01:05:05,568
I just want to make the case that don't play again on yourself when repertorising.
