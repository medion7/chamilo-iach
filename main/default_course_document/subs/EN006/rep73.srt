1
00:00:26,507 --> 00:00:43,600
The topic of today is repertorisation, analysis of symptoms and everything you want to know about it and never dare to ask.

2
00:00:46,005 --> 00:01:00,924
When I was preparing this day with you, my wish was that I would be able to say at least one thing to each of you

3
00:01:01,024 --> 00:01:05,397
which you would find worthwhile.

4
00:01:08,832 --> 00:01:15,360
But I had two problems. The first is that I did not know everyone of you

5
00:01:16,512 --> 00:01:28,864
and the second that I didn't know what has been taught to you before about Repertory and repertorisation.

6
00:01:32,427 --> 00:01:41,244
I prepared a few topics and I will speak about these topics before noon and in the afternoon

7
00:01:41,344 --> 00:01:52,359
I have prepared some exercises and we will spread them throughout the day.

8
00:01:52,651 --> 00:02:07,655
But what I would look to request is that each of you reflects to find a question, at least one question

9
00:02:07,755 --> 00:02:19,104
about Repertory and repertorisation. One question, one topic you would like to discuss today

10
00:02:19,787 --> 00:02:32,017
and I will collect the papers at the last by 1 o'clock. Then I will read them during the break

11
00:02:32,117 --> 00:02:49,120
while you swim and take siesta and I will try to move the topics and the exercises and the things I bring to you

12
00:02:49,677 --> 00:02:54,439
even more at the direction of your requests.

13
00:02:54,539 --> 00:03:03,911
So this means that it is also your responsibility if you will be happy at the end of this day.

14
00:03:06,272 --> 00:03:18,033
Start reflecting about the one question you would like to discuss. Some of you may know it already, other ones they will need deep reflection

15
00:03:20,672 --> 00:03:26,716
I will remind you from time to time but it is the one thing I expect from you.

16
00:03:26,816 --> 00:03:36,160
A question in writing. You can write in English, you can write in German or for you in (?)

17
00:03:40,107 --> 00:03:50,219
and I hope this will allow us to cover the topic in a very thorough way.

18
00:03:51,285 --> 00:04:08,523
-There is one question. I don't speak for the class, it's only my question and you have to decide whether to accept or not.

19
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:19,040
We have in the Repertory some kinds of repertorisation and then you can see what it is, symptom, evaluation, great remedies, little remedies ...

20
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:25,255
but the specific feature of VES from George Vithoulkas, I'm very interested in.

21
00:04:25,355 --> 00:04:35,985
What's the (?) idea of his VES given in the repertorisation? You can use it and you see the results but I don't know in every step

22
00:04:36,085 --> 00:04:38,603
what's the specific behind this.

23
00:04:38,703 --> 00:04:47,989
-I will offer the rules for the VES from Manfred.

24
00:04:57,632 --> 00:05:08,384
I'll speak a little bit first about repertorising, in a very general way.

25
00:05:14,571 --> 00:05:26,332
I would like to start to ask from you a clear and concise definition of the repertorisation.

26
00:05:26,432 --> 00:05:33,387
Can anyone give me a precise definition?

27
00:05:59,968 --> 00:06:15,797
So you say find the symptoms, evaluate them and there is something lacking...

28
00:06:18,592 --> 00:06:24,267
... combining. Because the point is that every rubric contains a number of remedies.

29
00:06:25,163 --> 00:06:35,175
Repertorisation is combining the symptoms so the common remedies stand out.

30
00:06:41,739 --> 00:06:45,365
I say the remedies stand out, is that clear in German what I mean?

31
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:54,225
I don't say to add because that' too limited. There are many ways to look at symptoms.

32
00:06:54,325 --> 00:06:59,004
It's not just add.

33
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:07,857
We have a symptom which contains remedies, another symptom which contains remedies

34
00:07:07,957 --> 00:07:12,977
and we combine them. This is the idea of repertorisation.

35
00:07:13,077 --> 00:07:20,821
The next step is, I don't know if you heard, there are different types of repertorisation

36
00:07:23,381 --> 00:07:27,292
or that at least the word is being used in different contexts.

37
00:07:27,392 --> 00:07:35,783
You have repertorisation, using the Repertory and you have repertorisation of Materia Medica.

38
00:07:35,883 --> 00:07:44,523
You heard about these terms? Repertorising Materia Medica?

39
00:07:47,851 --> 00:07:56,256
Only one person, 2, 3?

40
00:08:11,104 --> 00:08:22,091
I will explain you shortly because my idea was that this concept of repertorising Materia Medica was much more reknown.

41
00:08:23,072 --> 00:08:29,137
As I have introduced it, I will now go ahead and explain what it is.

42
00:08:37,749 --> 00:08:43,815
Some people used the Materia Medica books to computer soft wares, any of the computer soft wares

43
00:08:43,915 --> 00:08:50,812
to create a rubric, symptom with remedies.

44
00:08:50,912 --> 00:09:00,135
So they say, for example, fear of dark. They search fear, dark in Materia Medica, they get a number of remedies

45
00:09:02,773 --> 00:09:13,724
and from this they create a rubric which they use in repertorisation and which is possible because, as we just learned

46
00:09:13,824 --> 00:09:20,800
the precise definition of repertorisation is combining symptoms which contain remedies.

47
00:09:21,696 --> 00:09:31,089
So in a way if they come from the Repertory of from the Materia Medica, you can use the Materia Medica rubric with remedies.

48
00:09:32,704 --> 00:09:40,427
I want to explain and show you a little bit about this because I believe there are some misunderstandings

49
00:09:41,408 --> 00:09:51,783
about repertorising Materia Medica, especially for those who begin to remember and read about it and now realize what it is.

50
00:09:54,037 --> 00:10:02,236
I will first show you how it happens.

51
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:32,680
In the Materia Medica we have fear of dark.

52
00:10:36,384 --> 00:10:44,192
And when we search, we find for all the different books, the remedies which contain a symptom

53
00:10:44,939 --> 00:10:57,525
with the word fear and the word dark.  A symptom, any sentence which contains as well the word fear and the word dark.

54
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:12,913
The next step will be to say create a rubric. So we will have a Materia Medica rubric, fear of dark, Lac Caninum, Lyssinum, Medorrhinum,

55
00:11:13,013 --> 00:11:17,884
Variolinum, Camphora, Aconitum etc.

56
00:11:17,984 --> 00:11:25,457
You could then go to your Repertory program, combine this rubric with any other rubric and you have repertorised Materia Medica.

57
00:11:28,373 --> 00:11:45,220
-In our version, when we put the word and search for the rubric, we got the books and we have to look for the word in the books that we got.

58
00:11:57,152 --> 00:12:03,829
-I will show you that you can do it during the break. Don't worry.

59
00:12:10,037 --> 00:12:14,993
But this is not the point I'm making, I'm not talking about how to set up and options of the program.

60
00:12:15,093 --> 00:12:20,100
I'm talking about repertorising Materia Medica. You understand?

61
00:12:23,563 --> 00:12:29,195
I must tell you about repertorising not about option this and ...

62
00:12:50,827 --> 00:12:59,000
I will repeat what I do, I click on this icon. The second icon from the top, I click on it.

63
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:08,512
Then I get this screen, I type the word fear space and the word dark.

64
00:13:10,517 --> 00:13:17,940
I type two words, then I go apply to all and I have these results.

65
00:13:20,075 --> 00:13:25,180
You may have different results but that's an option in the program and I will show you if you like during the break.

66
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:33,800
I put two words and it finds all the symptom which contain the two words.

67
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:53,617
We have a set of remedies, a symptom fear of dark with a set of remedies, we put it in the Repertory to repertorize.

68
00:13:56,683 --> 00:14:01,376
There is a problem.

69
00:14:02,784 --> 00:14:10,315
When you read the texts, so I click on documents

70
00:14:13,707 --> 00:14:19,921
when you read the text of these symptoms, you see fear of the dark, there is much anxiety

71
00:14:20,021 --> 00:14:25,105
fear of ghosts when in the dark, fear of dark, fear of walking in the dark, fear of darkness etc.

72
00:14:30,048 --> 00:14:39,989
for every symptom you read, you get  a sentence which expresses fear of dark.

73
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:56,139
However when you continue reading each sentence

74
00:14:58,037 --> 00:15:09,109
for this symptom which is Lac Caninum, there is a phrase which speaks about dreams and that (?) troubles by dreams after dark

75
00:15:09,984 --> 00:15:16,789
but that he has a fear of snakes. So in this symptom fear and dark is not present.

76
00:15:18,219 --> 00:15:21,269
It is in fact fear of snakes and something else about dark.

77
00:15:22,123 --> 00:15:28,487
But in the same sentence, the word dark is there.

78
00:15:45,739 --> 00:15:59,036
The next symptom here it says fear of suffocation and the uvula is dark red. So the word dark is related to the color red.

79
00:15:59,136 --> 00:16:02,293
And the fear is related to suffocation.

80
00:16:02,848 --> 00:16:11,537
If I take this symptom into my Materia Medica repertorisation, as a symptom of a remedy for fear of dark

81
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:15,953
I make a mistake.

82
00:16:16,992 --> 00:16:25,639
It means that if I do a search for fear of dark, before I use these results in the repertorisation

83
00:16:25,739 --> 00:16:33,440
I must read every symptom to make sure it corresponds to what I'm asking.

84
00:16:33,995 --> 00:16:44,405
If I say fear of dark, I must read every symptom, if it contains fear of dark and not fear of suffocation with a dark red uvula.

85
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:52,156
The people who repertorize Materia Medica, they are not sufficiently aware of that. That is my feeling.

86
00:16:52,256 --> 00:16:59,211
And in this way a lot of mistakes are introduced while repertorising Materia Medica.

87
00:16:59,808 --> 00:17:08,512
In fact the correct way would be to go to the Repertory and check if Lac Caninum, for example, is in the rubric

88
00:17:09,024 --> 00:17:12,864
the Repertory rubric fear of dark and if not to add it.

89
00:17:15,424 --> 00:17:20,800
Once and for once.

90
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:27,292
And the next time I use my Repertory rubric fear of dark, it contains the correct information from Materia Medica.

91
00:17:27,392 --> 00:17:36,529
And it doesn't contain this remedy which has fear of suffocation and dark red uvula.

92
00:17:36,629 --> 00:17:46,364
So to repertorize from Materia Medica it is first of all dangerous because you introduce errors without knowing.

93
00:17:46,464 --> 00:17:58,055
Second, if you are aware that you must read the symptoms before you decide, the remedy belongs to fear of dark

94
00:17:58,155 --> 00:18:07,264
you have a lot of work. So it is very laborious and you should do it only once for one rubric.

95
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,021
And then possible update your Repertory in a correct way.

96
00:18:18,336 --> 00:18:27,047
Of course you could say, but in my program I can say the word fear and dark must be near to each other

97
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:32,267
and not too far away. Correct.

98
00:18:33,611 --> 00:18:40,437
That is correct but even when they are close to each other, there is still a chance of mistake.

99
00:18:40,992 --> 00:18:50,059
For example he has a red dark uvula with a fear of suffocation and dark and fear are very close to each other.

100
00:18:50,507 --> 00:18:53,899
So still you need to read.

101
00:18:55,243 --> 00:19:03,783
Someone else may say, if it's a program for two words maybe we can use it for one word.

102
00:19:03,883 --> 00:19:08,476
It's more easy to repertorize Materia Medica.

103
00:19:08,576 --> 00:19:17,792
So I will give you the example of jealous.

104
00:19:20,992 --> 00:19:27,051
I find all the remedies which contain the word jealous.

105
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:36,309
But if I go to the texts, of course I see all the symptoms contain the word jealous

106
00:19:37,248 --> 00:19:43,136
and most of them I agree, they will fit to the rubric jealousy, correct.

107
00:19:44,395 --> 00:19:50,325
But read the first symptom. Ailments from jealousy, it is different.

108
00:19:53,269 --> 00:19:56,149
Can anyone tell me the difference between jealousy and ailments from jealousy?

109
00:19:56,981 --> 00:20:01,400
Or fright and ailments from fright?

110
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:18,592
-The difference seems to be the causation. Jealousy has gone up to some specific aggravations.

111
00:20:19,787 --> 00:20:31,563
Jealousy is simply a state and ailment from this is aggravation by it. Jealousy you can see in certain kind of the body or at emotional level.

112
00:20:34,421 --> 00:20:40,913
-The person who is jealous, is jealous. The person who has ailments from jealous is jealous as well.

113
00:20:43,189 --> 00:20:50,471
But the difference is that the person who has ailments from jealousy, at certain moment got into a big problem

114
00:20:50,571 --> 00:21:00,832
because of feeling jealous, because of a certain precise situation and from that situation onwards, an aggravation, as you say

115
00:21:01,941 --> 00:21:08,460
develops on ailments, complains, which have remained and which are deep ailments from jealousy.

116
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:17,500
Which may well be something very different, maybe headache, jealous episode when a man discovered his wife was going to Alonissos

117
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,421
and there are some affairs there...

118
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:31,687
The man had a big surge of jealousy and from that moment on, headaches all the time.

119
00:21:31,787 --> 00:21:37,013
I see many people nodding so I must probably made a case.

120
00:21:42,347 --> 00:21:51,889
Even for one word if you repertorize Materia Medica, you must read the symptoms before you repertorize Materia Medica.

121
00:21:57,195 --> 00:22:03,665
Before I give the conclusion, I would like to know if there are any questions about this repertorising Materia Medica

122
00:22:03,765 --> 00:22:09,675
and the things you must watch for?

123
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:17,468
-Why can't we use the same search function in Materia Medica, as one can in the Radar program

124
00:22:17,568 --> 00:22:25,788
where you have the possibility of the search function using two words putting them together...?

125
00:22:25,888 --> 00:22:31,676
-I must say I'm not quite clear about the question because I believed I used two words to search the symptom.

126
00:22:31,776 --> 00:22:34,044
So what is the difference ?

127
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:42,321
-When I use the search word fear and (?)  I only get rubrics which have exactly (?).

128
00:22:44,512 --> 00:22:50,897
-No, you have a misunderstanding. If I am in the Repertory and I use the word fear and dark

129
00:22:50,997 --> 00:22:59,900
I may as well find other symptoms because the result will also be any symptom which contains the word fear and dark.

130
00:23:05,205 --> 00:23:11,185
You are right, the problem is less. Because the Repertory is much more structured.

131
00:23:11,285 --> 00:23:18,844
You don't have these big symptoms with all kinds of variations but as a principle

132
00:23:18,944 --> 00:23:19,691
as a rule, the problem is the same.

133
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:27,719
It is only much less because Materia Medica is (?) where anybody says anything and in the Repertory it is structured.

134
00:23:34,091 --> 00:23:40,363
-If you put in, fear and dark and shows you all sentences where it appears fear and dark

135
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:46,507
it shows if it's divided by a comma, by a semi-coma, by a dot as well?

136
00:23:47,339 --> 00:23:53,480
So what is the range the two words have to appear in Materia Medica?

137
00:23:54,272 --> 00:24:02,976
-For this version of the program which some of you have, the range is one sentence.

138
00:24:03,211 --> 00:24:06,097
-So if it appears in two sentences, then it will not show?

139
00:24:06,197 --> 00:24:12,597
-No, then it will be even worse, in a way.
-Thank you.

140
00:24:23,968 --> 00:24:34,485
-To improve this why don't you just take fear of dark and give it a certain range?

141
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:44,440
-You will improve it, if you use fear of dark, you will have less mistakes but still you will need to read through each symptom to make sure.

142
00:24:45,387 --> 00:24:49,717
-It could be dark red of something else.

143
00:24:50,357 --> 00:24:55,136
-Fear of suffocation with a dark red uvula will still come up.

144
00:24:55,691 --> 00:25:03,328
So whatever you do, even one word, as I saw you, you need to read the results before you can use it.

145
00:25:04,501 --> 00:25:10,987
Anyone has an idea to which conclusion I want to come?

146
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:22,407
-That is very interesting to use the Repertory to repertorize.

147
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:41,073
-Because when I go here and I look at the rubric mind, fear, dark I know that every remedy in it

148
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:47,467
has a big chance of being correctly related to fear of dark.

149
00:25:51,093 --> 00:25:59,904
When I have a patient and he has a fear of dark, I can either repertorize Materia Medica

150
00:26:01,077 --> 00:26:06,801
and I will have the problem of reading all the symptoms and make sure that the remedies correspond to the fear of dark etc.

151
00:26:11,744 --> 00:26:17,873
and this is one thing or I can just go to the Repertory and look at mind, fear of dark.

152
00:26:17,973 --> 00:26:27,616
But the information in the Repertory for the precise rubric is more readily available.

153
00:26:28,725 --> 00:26:31,420
That's the difference.

154
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:38,731
-Do you actually need  the Materia Medica repertorisation and we have some kind of a special thing

155
00:26:39,093 --> 00:26:41,560
which usually can't find in the repertorisation.

156
00:26:43,765 --> 00:26:51,452
Then what I think, it should have been, if that's the way it comes out when I put fear of dark, then all the fears and all the ofs

157
00:26:51,552 --> 00:26:54,325
and the darks coming up, it's complicated.

158
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:02,780
Isn't something that combines certain words? You can do this or that or only this and that.

159
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,343
It must be something like that in the program.

160
00:27:06,443 --> 00:27:13,227
-Yes. You could search for the fear of dark and not uvula.

161
00:27:13,781 --> 00:27:20,885
-No, to search for fear of dark and not all the ofs in the Materia Medica or all the darks or all the fears.

162
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,268
-Yes but the problem remains. You may diminish the problem but the problem remains.

163
00:27:26,368 --> 00:27:32,384
-Of course I have to read it, that's the main thing, you read Materia Medica and it's beautiful.

164
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:36,032
You learn while doing it, that's the main important thing.

165
00:27:37,163 --> 00:27:46,300
-What you have not seen maybe, if I want to use the rubric Materia Medica jealousy

166
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:52,821
and you say, it's a beautiful thing to read the Materia Medica, there are in this search 149 symptoms I have to read.

167
00:27:53,483 --> 00:27:57,920
For the first symptom. For fear of dark, there are maybe 180 symptoms.

168
00:27:58,517 --> 00:28:05,380
And I think if you like to read the Materia Medica, it's nice but your patient who is sitting and wait for the prescription

169
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:10,500
he would prefer you just take fear of dark and Repertory jealousy ... give Stramonium and he goes.

170
00:28:11,637 --> 00:28:18,229
-That's it, you never use this for the simple things. Jealousy you can look in the Repertory.

171
00:28:18,933 --> 00:28:24,529
And fear of dark also. It's only for the special things that you don't find in the Repertory.

172
00:28:24,629 --> 00:28:31,292
-Exactly, that's the place. So I may have given the impression (?) against using Materia Medica.

173
00:28:31,392 --> 00:28:36,476
It's not true. It's not what I want to communicate to you.

174
00:28:36,576 --> 00:28:40,949
I want to say first that to repertorize the Materia Medica you must be very careful

175
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,161
I even don't say, don't do it. I say, be very careful.

176
00:28:47,648 --> 00:28:53,899
The second thing I say is to repertorize, use a Repertory.

177
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,215
And then the third thing you say, we can easily add, I totally agree with you

178
00:28:58,315 --> 00:29:07,004
is that, if you have special information or even if you have jealousy and you don't find the remedy

179
00:29:07,104 --> 00:29:11,691
you may use the Materia Medica for all these occasions, absolutely.

180
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,840
Don't disregard the Materia Medica.

181
00:29:16,085 --> 00:29:21,852
Just the topic of today is repertorisation. The first thing I wanted to explain to you is the difference

182
00:29:21,952 --> 00:29:26,133
between repertorising Materia Medica and repertorising Repertory.

183
00:29:35,819 --> 00:29:48,576
I will now speak about repertorisation methods.

184
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,123
Repertorisation methods.

185
00:30:31,136 --> 00:30:44,340
If we have a set of symptoms and I will show you a set of symptoms

186
00:30:48,608 --> 00:31:00,661
we have 11 symptoms, so to repertorize means to find the remedy which stands out related to these rubrics.

187
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:09,067
The obvious and most often applied way to repertorize it is the sum of symptoms.

188
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:25,536
Sum of symptoms which means if I find a remedy which is present in 9 or 10 of these symptoms

189
00:31:26,048 --> 00:31:34,219
I'm very happy and if I find a remedy which is present on 11 symptoms, I'm exceedingly happy.

190
00:31:37,056 --> 00:31:39,851
That is the repertorisation by sum of symptoms.

191
00:31:40,555 --> 00:31:52,587
Now if you read the cases of Kent, in his (?) lectures, anyone knows how he repertories there?

192
00:31:53,549 --> 00:32:02,464
-Usually he uses the remedy according to the totality, meaning he was searching for a symptom which covers most of the symptoms in the case.

193
00:32:03,019 --> 00:32:10,460
But he made a distinction between all the symptoms checking which symptoms were (?) for the case.

194
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:19,367
-Yes, so you say Kent used the totality of the symptoms to find the remedy which covered the totality for the best.

195
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,849
Do you know how he did it?

196
00:32:24,949 --> 00:32:28,540
-(?) to create a Repertory and should be used as Repertory.

197
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:43,808
-What he did is he took the first rubric and he writes all the remedies, maybe 30 remedies.

198
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,900
When he explains the case he says, this is an interesting symptom and he writes down all the remedies.

199
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:58,215
Then he says, the second symptom I find interesting is a symptom so and so and

200
00:32:58,315 --> 00:33:05,803
if I look at the remedies of symptom 2, the remedies which are coming with these are 1,2,3,4,5,9,11... and

201
00:33:08,043 --> 00:33:13,425
he comes down to 20 remedies.

202
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:22,500
Then another very interesting symptom is a symptom Nr 3 and he looks symptoms Nr 3 by itself

203
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:31,900
contains 20 remedies, he checks which remedies are common with the results so far

204
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:41,040
and he finds there are remedies 1,4,5 and 11.

205
00:33:42,859 --> 00:33:54,507
So at the end, after he has taken for example 6 symptoms, he says the remedy is Nr 4.

206
00:33:56,235 --> 00:34:04,007
It is in fact totality. In the cases of Kent you will see a lot of cases when he uses this method

207
00:34:04,107 --> 00:34:09,040
he writes down all the remedies for each symptom and then trims down the list.

208
00:34:12,512 --> 00:34:17,120
So it's really totality and there is a second aspect which has a technical name

209
00:34:17,717 --> 00:34:21,899
especially nowadays because we can do it so easily yes or no with the computers.

210
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:30,944
He uses totality, sum of symptoms but he uses also every symptom as an eliminating symptom.

211
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:36,780
An eliminating symptom, I will explain to you what it is.

212
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:46,944
An eliminating symptom is a symptom and the remedies of this symptom eliminates all the other remedies

213
00:34:47,307 --> 00:34:52,981
from any other rubric you will add to repertorisation.

214
00:34:55,221 --> 00:35:07,445
In a case you may have 6 symptoms and you decide that symptom Nr 3 should be an eliminating symptom.

215
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:11,143
Why would you possibly decide this?

216
00:35:11,243 --> 00:35:18,560
Because you believe that this is a very important  symptom, so to say the remedy must have this symptom.

217
00:35:19,392 --> 00:35:23,616
So you make it an eliminating symptom.

218
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:34,475
And if this symptom contains 6 remedies, these 6 remedies are the ones who are considered.

219
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:44,871
Any other remedy which contains many more and different remedies, these remedies will be disregarded, eliminated.

220
00:35:44,971 --> 00:35:54,507
The computer programs today, if you introduce an eliminating symptom, will only look for 1,4,5,11.

221
00:35:56,043 --> 00:36:00,480
So for the remedies of the eliminating rubric. And this is called an eliminating symptom.

222
00:36:01,397 --> 00:36:06,545
You can have in a set of symptoms, one eliminating symptom or as Kent did

223
00:36:06,645 --> 00:36:10,480
in fact every symptom is an eliminating symptom.

224
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:18,208
Are there any questions about eliminating symptom and this little parenthesis about Kent?

225
00:36:18,571 --> 00:36:21,600
-This method is very good but it's very dangerous.

226
00:36:22,816 --> 00:36:28,875
Because you have a remedy which goes through all symptoms but it's not the right for the case.

227
00:36:29,749 --> 00:36:35,300
You have another remedy which doesn't go through all symptoms but in a higher degree

228
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,847
it has something to (?) to the remedy. Therefore it's very dangerous to do only this method.

229
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:53,493
-Yes.

230
00:36:54,197 --> 00:37:03,020
This is another chapter I will explain you. Using repertorisation by hand induces us to reason in a certain way.

231
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:12,060
And using repertorisation with computer soft wares, helps us to reason in another way.

232
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:22,740
We will come back to it but I agree it is dangerous. I will give you another explanation why it is dangerous to do this.

233
00:37:27,968 --> 00:37:41,700
Suppose in the last but one step, we have a remedy for 9 and 11.

234
00:37:43,648 --> 00:37:48,580
And then we add one more symptom and we see it's only the remedy 4 which common.

235
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:58,247
So we eliminate 9 and 11. Remedy 4 is found in each of the 6 symptoms.

236
00:37:58,347 --> 00:38:10,727
Maybe this last interesting rubric of 15 remedies contains another remedy

237
00:38:10,827 --> 00:38:28,360
for example Nr 3. Nr 3 is present everywhere except in symptom Nr 5.

238
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:34,976
Can you follow mathematics?

239
00:38:37,664 --> 00:38:42,983
If remedy 3 is not present in step 5, it's not there.

240
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:52,789
And remedy 4 may cover totality but remedy 3 may cover the 6 symptoms except 5.

241
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:57,525
Then if you aren't not a slave to the Repertory and you go to the Materia Medica

242
00:38:58,549 --> 00:39:05,880
you may as well read remedy 3 is a much better fit than remedy 4.

243
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:13,952
Don't drown into mathematics.

244
00:39:15,083 --> 00:39:22,507
Therefore I agree if we use everything to eliminating symptom, very dangerous.

245
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:30,855
Because it may well been that out of the 15 remedies of the last interesting symptom

246
00:39:32,256 --> 00:39:38,549
about every remedy covers 5 symptoms instead of 6, but we have eliminated them all at one step

247
00:39:39,467 --> 00:39:44,785
because of the one symptom which was not present.

248
00:39:46,464 --> 00:39:54,641
Just to explain about totality, about eliminating symptom and about the limitations of this method.

249
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:05,451
A second way to repertorize is because of the degrees.

250
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,760
The degrees of the Repertory.

251
00:40:10,656 --> 00:40:18,549
First of all can you tell me the degree in the Repertory where does it stand for?

252
00:40:19,381 --> 00:40:27,520
Can anyone tell me what is indicated by a degree in the Repertory?

253
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:44,256
-It stands for that the symptom has to be very clear like it's capital. Then it has to be very clear and very intense.

254
00:40:45,493 --> 00:40:53,621
-The symptom is very clear and intense on what level?

255
00:40:57,376 --> 00:41:04,760
The intensity means that for the patient who (?) that state, he would describe the symptom as being very, very intense.

256
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,875
-Yes OK.

257
00:41:10,496 --> 00:41:16,817
-(?) an information how often the symptom appeared in the provings.

258
00:41:16,917 --> 00:41:26,133
-So the frequency of appearance in the provings. The (?) indicate frequency of appearance in the provings.

259
00:41:31,701 --> 00:41:45,480
-You have to consider both, frequency in the provings one, the intensity of the provings two and both frequency and intensity three.

260
00:41:46,571 --> 00:41:54,960
-OK but we are missing one half I would say.

261
00:41:55,552 --> 00:42:02,037
-A mixture between how often you find it in the provings, how intense is in the provings and clinically how often it has been proved.

262
00:42:02,784 --> 00:42:11,793
-Yes. It is frequency of appearance in the provings and frequency of appearance in the clinical cured cases.

263
00:42:11,893 --> 00:42:19,080
And it is this mixture, this combination which defines the degree.

264
00:42:24,096 --> 00:42:31,292
-An interesting, important question always is, the old ones say, as far as I'm informed, that

265
00:42:31,392 --> 00:42:39,120
a remedy goes to the Repertory after it has caused symptom in a healthy person.

266
00:42:44,981 --> 00:42:50,640
-So it means proving.
-Yes, proving symptom goes into the Materia Medica.

267
00:42:52,235 --> 00:42:56,160
This occurs frequently so we make it more important in the Repertory.

268
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:10,880
Now we have a Repertory where the intensity is extremely important.

269
00:43:11,435 --> 00:43:17,905
I do repertorizations frequently and sometimes they change only the degree of one symptom by one step

270
00:43:18,005 --> 00:43:23,388
and it changes completely the results.

271
00:43:24,469 --> 00:43:34,396
The old authors also say, the intensity is very important or did they say it's just the frequency of occurrence?

272
00:43:37,653 --> 00:43:49,173
The intensity of the proving, does that go to the Repertory straight away from the old authors or is what we do nowadays?

273
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:57,927
-If you want, I can search for it in the afternoon but the original texts from Kent they only speak about frequency of occurrence.

274
00:43:58,027 --> 00:44:05,052
And they do not speak if the fear of dark was very intense in one subject or so.

275
00:44:05,152 --> 00:44:10,897
They speak about it happened once in a proving, it happened sometimes or many times?

276
00:44:10,997 --> 00:44:18,460
Also on the clinical cases it was sometimes cured or clinically often very (?) it's frequency.

277
00:44:21,323 --> 00:44:27,700
But it is true that the remedies are introducing the Repertory because of the appearance in the proving.

278
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:35,153
But also some remedies are introduces because they appear on the basis of clinical information.

279
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:49,931
I replied about intensity for Kent but this notion of degree has changed.

280
00:44:58,912 --> 00:45:04,764
-We used the intensity of a symptom of the Repertory like fear of dark Stramonium 4th degree

281
00:45:07,189 --> 00:45:16,853
and it says this remedy is the most important remedy for fear of the dark, it has it with the highest intensity you can imagine.

282
00:45:17,856 --> 00:45:26,520
So we take it as intensity but the old ones actually gave it to the Repertory from frequency of occurrence.

283
00:45:31,339 --> 00:45:37,376
There are two things we must separate. The first is when a remedy is introduced

284
00:45:38,229 --> 00:45:41,009
why it gets a certain degree.

285
00:45:41,109 --> 00:45:52,779
And then this normally so far, especially for the old guys, it is the frequency of appearance in the proving or in the clinical cases.

286
00:45:53,888 --> 00:46:04,284
That's one thing. The other thing is the intensity of the symptom in interrogation of the patient.

287
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:18,997
Someone says, I drink some milk, I really like milk, I couldn't afford not drink milk, I must have milk.

288
00:46:19,744 --> 00:46:27,239
Someone else says, I drink a lot of milk. I drink a liter of milk, I drink every day 3 lt of milk.

289
00:46:27,339 --> 00:46:34,855
So there is intensity. And then there is this correspondence which is in fact part of the VES.

290
00:46:34,955 --> 00:46:37,180
That's a different thing.

291
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:53,580
Right now I'm explaining only about the degree in the Repertory and how it has got a certain degree, a certain number 1,2,3,4.

292
00:46:56,416 --> 00:47:05,600
And there is some people saying because the symptom was often appearing in the clinical cases and in the provings

293
00:47:06,827 --> 00:47:10,801
we believe that you must consider the degree.

294
00:47:10,901 --> 00:47:21,084
Some people make a big case out of this and one of them is an Israeli homeopath, Joseph (?)

295
00:47:21,184 --> 00:47:32,519
who believes that we should repertorize mostly emphasizing the sum of the degrees.

296
00:47:49,429 --> 00:47:59,477
I must change it a little bit to explain what I want to explain.

297
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:06,801
You remember they were 11 symptoms. The figure beneath the remedy is the sum of symptoms.

298
00:48:06,901 --> 00:48:22,439
It says 9 for Calcarea. You see next to symptom 4, you see a little dot. It means that Calcarea is not present in that symptom.

299
00:48:22,539 --> 00:48:31,313
The sum of these 11 symptoms for Calcarea is 9, for Lachesis is 8, for Bryonia is 7 etc.

300
00:48:31,413 --> 00:48:35,320
This is the first thing I explained to you. So we just add the symptoms.

301
00:48:36,555 --> 00:48:42,599
The second possibility it is to have the sum of degrees.

302
00:48:42,699 --> 00:48:51,623
You get a bigger figure because the addition which was made is for Lachesis for example 3 points, it is in 3rd degree.

303
00:48:51,723 --> 00:49:02,396
Plus 3 points, plus 1, plus 2 etc. When you add the degrees of the remedy to each of the symptoms where it is present

304
00:49:02,496 --> 00:49:11,072
you have 17 for Lachesis etc.

305
00:49:12,203 --> 00:49:18,183
So in this sum you consider the frequency the remedy appeared in the provings and in the clinical cases.

306
00:49:21,483 --> 00:49:27,456
Is it clear for you, you understand sum of degrees?

307
00:49:28,288 --> 00:49:34,439
It is a different way to look at the same information. That's why I say, find the remedy which stands out.

308
00:49:34,539 --> 00:49:37,831
You repertorize, you find the remedy which stands out, if you make sum of symptoms.

309
00:49:37,931 --> 00:49:41,387
It's a way to look at it, it's the way which Kent used.

310
00:49:42,176 --> 00:49:46,044
If you take sum of degrees, you look at different remedies in a way.

311
00:49:46,144 --> 00:49:57,009
And by chance Pulsatilla, Lachesis and Calcarea are first in this case but for some cases the remedy has just moved (?)

312
00:49:57,109 --> 00:50:01,340
because you look sum of symptoms and other time you look sum of degrees.

313
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:05,607
So different approach.

314
00:50:15,456 --> 00:50:18,151
-The first one you showed us was the sum of degrees.

315
00:50:18,251 --> 00:50:23,200
-Sum of symptoms was the first one.

316
00:50:27,787 --> 00:50:30,496
-Sum of symptoms 9, 8,7 on 11 symptoms.

317
00:50:33,184 --> 00:50:40,337
-And the second one is sum of degrees. You add the degrees of the remedy in each symptom.

318
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:45,841
-And which one is the middle between them ?
-What do you mean between?

319
00:50:46,795 --> 00:50:53,479
-I press here, I press on this icon to have sum of degrees.

320
00:50:53,579 --> 00:51:03,100
-So which one is the second?
-That's a little detail. It's a sorting on alphabetical order or not.

321
00:51:04,864 --> 00:51:10,780
-These both first items are sum of symptoms, alphabetical or not, these two sum of degrees, alphabetical or not.

322
00:51:13,803 --> 00:51:16,597
-You had a question?

323
00:51:19,008 --> 00:51:25,429
-Obviously one person says, we emphasize sum of symptoms, other person says, we emphasize sum of degrees.

324
00:51:25,984 --> 00:51:33,472
And so obviously another person says, I would like to combine and to have sum of symptoms and degrees.

325
00:51:40,341 --> 00:51:45,895
And you add these figures and you come up with another number which considers as well the totality of the symptoms

326
00:51:45,995 --> 00:51:50,119
as the importance of the degrees for that remedy.

327
00:51:50,219 --> 00:51:55,189
It's a different approach.

328
00:51:59,563 --> 00:52:06,475
Sum of symptoms and degrees. Then I will explain you different repertorization matters

329
00:52:07,392 --> 00:52:11,147
and another one it is to emphasize small rubrics.

330
00:52:18,144 --> 00:52:24,480
Small rubric means the number of remedies which is present in a symptom.

331
00:52:27,467 --> 00:52:33,376
Fear of dark has so many symptoms, fear of dark when alone has fewer symptoms. It's a smaller rubric.

332
00:52:34,165 --> 00:52:43,409
Emphasizing smaller rubric it means in repertorization matters, that if a remedy is present in a small rubric

333
00:52:43,509 --> 00:52:50,860
it gets more weight, more emphasis.

334
00:52:52,832 --> 00:53:05,461
And this is a relative matter. If the remedy is present in a rubric which is smaller and smaller and smaller, it gets more and more weight.

335
00:53:06,464 --> 00:53:15,147
If the same remedy is present in a big rubric, it doesn't get a lot of weight because of this big rubric.

336
00:53:16,085 --> 00:53:22,620
But if Silica is present in a very small rubric, it gets a lot of weight.

337
00:53:25,195 --> 00:53:43,612
The result of this method is that the remedy which is put first is a remedy which is most present in smaller and smaller and smaller rubrics.

338
00:53:45,376 --> 00:53:59,185
So repertorisation method, small rubrics has as a result the remedy which is most present in the smaller rubrics.

339
00:54:01,397 --> 00:54:06,929
-What does the computer consider to be small rubric? Where does it start?

340
00:54:08,267 --> 00:54:11,765
-It doesn't start anywhere. It is gradual.

341
00:54:13,344 --> 00:54:21,685
Say, if the rubric contains 50 remedies, it gets a certain weight.

342
00:54:22,155 --> 00:54:25,084
If the rubric contains 30 remedies it gets more weight.

343
00:54:25,184 --> 00:54:30,069
If the rubric contains only 10 remedies, it gets still more weight. So it is gradual.

344
00:54:30,261 --> 00:54:36,789
There is no border. The smaller the rubric, the more weight it gets.

345
00:54:39,157 --> 00:54:45,813
You want to have the keynotes in a way? The small rubrics, you believe this is important for this case

346
00:54:46,325 --> 00:54:53,493
or you want to look at the same information from this angle, you use the method small rubrics.

347
00:54:59,381 --> 00:55:19,392
The 5th repertorization method is small remedies.

348
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:31,840
As the name says, this method of repertorization emphasizes small remedies.

349
00:55:33,045 --> 00:55:35,712
This is a small rubric, this is a small remedy.

350
00:55:36,309 --> 00:55:42,901
A small remedy is a remedy which occurs only few times in the Repertory.

351
00:55:44,352 --> 00:55:48,299
Calcarea Silicata is a small remedy than Calcarea Carbonica.

352
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:57,067
When we first developed this method, which is available in all computer soft wares

353
00:55:57,621 --> 00:56:01,937
emphasizing small remedies, first we did again gradual.

354
00:56:02,037 --> 00:56:07,861
The smaller the remedy, the more it is upgraded.

355
00:56:11,637 --> 00:56:15,947
When we first did it, we found that it's a bit of a problem to make this method useful

356
00:56:16,501 --> 00:56:20,491
because you always get remedies which are extremely small.

357
00:56:21,323 --> 00:56:26,016
Like Zincum, Valerianincum.

358
00:56:26,997 --> 00:56:35,509
So we changed the rules a little bit and we took into account with this method the totality.

359
00:56:35,609 --> 00:56:40,587
So little bit of combination of method one.

360
00:56:41,461 --> 00:56:45,216
You must have been wondering sometimes, those of you who have computer soft wares

361
00:56:46,005 --> 00:56:52,240
if you look at the method small remedies, you see Dulcamara, Causticum, Magnesium Muriaticum which are

362
00:56:53,040 --> 00:57:00,220
maybe relatively small but then you see maybe Anacardium, which is rather a big remedy

363
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:03,733
and it appears already on the 10th place.

364
00:57:03,797 --> 00:57:10,539
It is because totality is considered a little bit as well, also in a gradual way.

365
00:57:11,328 --> 00:57:15,620
So small remedies, the smaller it is, the more weight it gets, the more totality it has, the more it appears

366
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,521
whether it's big or small.

367
00:57:17,621 --> 00:57:21,760
So it's a combination but obviously (?) is to find small remedies.

368
00:57:22,549 --> 00:57:31,168
You have 11 symptoms, you search for a remedy and you gave all the (?) the Lachesis, Pulsatilla, Calcarea Carbonica

369
00:57:31,957 --> 00:57:36,956
all the remedies which were in the previous methods and today you want to give a small remedy

370
00:57:37,056 --> 00:57:50,524
you use the method small remedies and you find that you can think of Dulcamara, Causticum,  (?)

371
00:57:55,829 --> 00:58:10,044
The last repertorisation method is called prominence.

372
00:58:24,395 --> 00:58:30,027
I will need to give you a little explanation to show what is prominence.

373
00:58:53,301 --> 00:59:04,075
In this rubric mind-fear to be alone you have a number of remedies in the third degree

374
00:59:04,672 --> 00:59:08,476
a number of remedies in red, it's third degree, a number of remedies in second degree

375
00:59:08,576 --> 00:59:11,840
and a number of remedies in first degree which is black.

376
00:59:14,251 --> 00:59:22,165
Let's take the example of Lycopodium.

377
00:59:23,275 --> 00:59:28,764
You can say Lycopodium is prominent in this rubric because it is a third degree remedy.

378
00:59:28,864 --> 00:59:30,528
It appears well.

379
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:36,359
You can also say it is prominent in relation to the other third degree remedies

380
00:59:36,459 --> 00:59:45,895
because the fear of being alone is also shared by Argentum Nitricum, Arsenicum...

381
00:59:45,995 --> 00:59:50,183
So it is relatively prominent.

382
00:59:51,435 --> 01:00:22,069
However if we go to another rubric, to desire sweets, you see Lycopodium is there as well

383
01:00:22,773 --> 01:00:25,767
and you can say it is prominent because it is also in the third degree.

384
01:00:25,867 --> 01:00:35,196
But this time instead of blah, blah, blah it is only 4 other remedies in the third degree.

385
01:00:36,597 --> 01:00:42,507
So it means that in Lycopodium is more prominent in this rubric than in the rubric

386
01:00:42,607 --> 01:00:48,416
where it was accompanied by 10 other remedies in the third degree.

387
01:00:49,675 --> 01:00:54,823
So prominence means if you would make a curve of all the remedies at first degree

388
01:00:54,923 --> 01:01:03,697
second degree, third degree that this curve is sharper for the remedy which we're looking at.

389
01:01:03,797 --> 01:01:10,801
And in a big rubric where they are 12 remedies in third degree, the Lycopodium stands out relatively.

390
01:01:10,901 --> 01:01:21,547
In a smaller rubric where there are only 5 remedies in third degree, the Lycopodium stands out more, it is more prominent.

391
01:01:21,824 --> 01:01:37,105
So prominence it means to say it in a prominent way and homeopathically

392
01:01:37,205 --> 01:01:44,075
prominence means that the remedy which is prominent is more typical.

393
01:01:46,485 --> 01:02:02,279
If the symptom has only one or two other remedies in third degree, it is clear that this remedy is typical

394
01:02:02,379 --> 01:02:06,667
is important for the symptom and vice versa.

395
01:02:07,456 --> 01:02:13,216
If you look for Rhus Tox in restlessness, you see a lot of third degree remedies. It is not so prominent.

396
01:02:14,112 --> 01:02:22,667
But if you have, you look at the rubric continuing to move ameliorates, there is less third degree remedies.

397
01:02:23,499 --> 01:02:29,351
So the Rhus Tox is more prominent on that symptom than on the restlessness.

398
01:02:29,451 --> 01:02:31,925
You got the idea about prominence?

399
01:02:32,672 --> 01:02:39,249
This method makes again not black and white but a gradual calculation of the prominence of each rubric

400
01:02:39,349 --> 01:02:41,547
and each remedy.

401
01:02:43,317 --> 01:02:51,559
And it gives a certain factor, it says this is only the first third degree remedy in the symptom, so it is very prominent.

402
01:02:51,659 --> 01:02:58,443
And as a result you get this kind of prominence.

403
01:02:59,787 --> 01:03:06,165
Argentum Nitricum, desire sweets but aggravated from eating it.

404
01:03:07,275 --> 01:03:09,137
It's very prominent for Argentum Nitricum.

405
01:03:09,237 --> 01:03:14,912
It is the only third degree remedy. That's what we call prominence.

406
01:03:16,661 --> 01:03:20,764
And if we look at ailments from anticipation, which has Argentum Nitricum as well, it is less prominent

407
01:03:20,864 --> 01:03:28,523
because we have the Lycopodium and the Silica and the Calcarea and all the other remedies which have strong anticipation as well but less prominent.

408
01:03:29,184 --> 01:03:35,264
So do you have the difference between prominence and the degree?

409
01:03:39,317 --> 01:03:41,920
-Could I please ask again about intensity?

410
01:03:42,987 --> 01:03:51,563
Like you had that rubric desire sweet, food and it had a few remedies in the third degree like Lycopodium.

411
01:03:52,352 --> 01:03:58,055
So we could say, it's quite typical for Lycopodium to have desire for sweets

412
01:03:59,371 --> 01:04:08,892
and my question is, if I look just to understand because I always thought that if you look at the rubric

413
01:04:08,992 --> 01:04:14,375
and you see it in the third degree, it also would mean that Lycopodium has very strong desire for sweets.

414
01:04:14,475 --> 01:04:20,775
That's my question. What you had in the third degree is also intensity or not at all?

415
01:04:20,875 --> 01:04:32,060
-It is related but I would like, if I may, ask a bit more patience because when I will explain the VES

416
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:37,963
the VES is using this feature very strongly and I will explain it at that time.

417
01:04:43,851 --> 01:04:52,555
Before I go a little bit further, I would like to ask is there any questions you have about these 6 different methods of repertorization?

418
01:04:54,261 --> 01:05:02,197
You ask me to repeat small rubrics?

419
01:05:35,029 --> 01:05:40,092
I have 4 symptoms in my repertorization.

420
01:05:42,005 --> 01:05:48,085
The symptoms contain this amount of remedies.

421
01:05:57,792 --> 01:06:06,944
My repertorization contains 4 symptoms and this is the rubric size.

422
01:06:07,925 --> 01:06:21,280
If I want to apply small rubrics, I see that the lower I go, the smaller the rubric is.

423
01:06:22,069 --> 01:06:30,161
To go to the extreme, these 6 remedies they are not by definition small remedies.

424
01:06:30,261 --> 01:06:41,084
It may very well be that we find Calcarea, Silica and maybe a small remedy

425
01:06:41,184 --> 01:06:47,157
but Calcarea and Silica big remedies may be in a small rubric.

426
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:53,579
So this is why there is a difference between small rubrics method and small remedies method.

427
01:06:54,795 --> 01:06:59,047
Small rubric and small remedy doesn't go inside all the time.

428
01:06:59,147 --> 01:07:10,695
If I calculate from these 4 symptoms my method of small rubrics, what will happen?

429
01:07:10,795 --> 01:07:18,055
Every remedy which is present in the repertorisation and which is maybe 450 different remedies

430
01:07:20,736 --> 01:07:27,392
each of the 450 remedies, gets a certain figure.

431
01:07:28,331 --> 01:07:34,048
Because of its appearance in every symptom where it appears.

432
01:07:35,157 --> 01:07:37,461
Let's take the Calcarea.

433
01:07:38,165 --> 01:07:40,647
The Calcarea appears here but it is in a big rubric.

434
01:07:40,747 --> 01:07:50,204
So it gets figure 1. It appears in 200, in the symptom with 200 remedies

435
01:07:50,304 --> 01:07:55,829
so it gets a bigger number.

436
01:07:56,341 --> 01:08:05,969
If it appears in the still smaller rubric of 55, it gets a figure of 6.

437
01:08:06,069 --> 01:08:14,837
And because Calcarea appears as well in the very small rubric of 6 remedies, it gets maybe a figure of 10.

438
01:08:18,635 --> 01:08:26,513
So if Calcarea appears in a smaller, smaller, smaller rubric, it gets more and more weight.

439
01:08:26,613 --> 01:08:28,380
More and more importance.

440
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:34,507
And this calculation I just need to do it fro every remedy and every rubric.

441
01:08:38,069 --> 01:08:49,227
The result of this method is that I get a remedy which is present in the smaller and smallest rubrics.

442
01:08:50,016 --> 01:08:53,777
Whether it's a big remedy or a small remedy. That is not relevant.

443
01:08:53,877 --> 01:09:00,540
The more it is present in smaller rubrics, the more chance it has to appear on top of the list.

444
01:09:02,645 --> 01:09:13,404
-I think this word small rubrics and small remedies are in correlation to (?) often used remedies only.

445
01:09:13,504 --> 01:09:20,971
And so the degree it's very hard to see, it's fluent, you can not say this is a small remedy, this is a big remedy.

446
01:09:21,589 --> 01:09:34,012
I give you an example, on daily experience you prescribe (?) or Phosphorus and as a remedy (?) is not at all represented in the Materia Medica.

447
01:09:34,112 --> 01:09:41,579
It has no proving, no clinical experience and it's a remedy you need in daily practice every week.

448
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:49,372
And when you have these terms, small rubric and (?) it's not appearing in (?) but it's a great remedy.

449
01:09:49,984 --> 01:09:58,609
Therefore I would say these words have no sharp definition. I think they are complementary to (?)

450
01:09:58,709 --> 01:10:05,820
and it's often the representation in the Synthesis ...

451
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:13,244
-In fact I would say that now you're talking about a different topic which is combination remedies.

452
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:18,741
We can talk about it at a later stage.

453
01:10:23,755 --> 01:10:37,984
I would like to do two things. First I will summarize and conclude what I have explained to you now.

454
01:10:38,773 --> 01:10:45,792
I have given you the logic and the technique of the different repertorization methods.

455
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:51,915
We have discussed a little bit the advantages or the goal of using one method rather than another

456
01:10:54,000 --> 01:11:01,664
and most of all I understand that you can use one time this method, another time another method.

457
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:16,092
The point is that if look at any given case, that you use these different approaches all together...

458
01:11:21,547 --> 01:11:31,303
I will give you an example. You take symptoms and symptoms, again a symptom for Lachesis, again a symptom for Lachesis

459
01:11:31,403 --> 01:11:36,587
so you're thinking about totality but then it gives you a keynote.

460
01:11:37,376 --> 01:11:45,700
Look, he has that symptom, itching in the ears when sneezing in the morning after walking, what a symptom!

461
01:11:48,021 --> 01:11:52,395
And you find a small rubric, only 3 remedies, that will be interesting.

462
01:11:53,184 --> 01:11:56,640
And you reflect in your mind for the small rubric.

463
01:11:58,069 --> 01:12:00,437
You say, maybe it's one of the remedies in the small rubric.

464
01:12:01,824 --> 01:12:08,500
Consultation goes on and you see aggravated from sweets and still desires.

465
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:15,300
Prominent for Argentum Nitricum and Argentum Nitricum appeared in a high degree in other rubrics as well.

466
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:21,120
So you jump from repertorization method 6 to repertorization method 2.

467
01:12:22,091 --> 01:12:30,844
It moves on, it moves on. Then you see the appearance of another small remedy

468
01:12:30,944 --> 01:12:40,032
Calcarea Silicata and you say, ah I saw a few Calcareas, a few Silicas, so maybe it's a small remedy.

469
01:12:40,864 --> 01:12:43,765
And you focus on the case from small remedies.

470
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:54,140
The first I've given you is stones and within the stone you build the house as a whole.

471
01:12:54,240 --> 01:13:01,131
And the name of the house for me it is the VES.

472
01:13:02,112 --> 01:13:08,519
It considers the different repertorization methods and combines them all the time.

473
01:13:10,283 --> 01:13:14,193
To understand the VES this, in a way, is the first step.

474
01:13:14,293 --> 01:13:21,120
To understand we can look at information, the symptoms of a patient, from different angles.

475
01:13:22,293 --> 01:13:30,300
And then not so much to use repertorization method 1 for one patient, repertorization method 2 for another patient etc.

476
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:38,144
No. It is to use all the different repertorization methods and even other reasonings

477
01:13:39,019 --> 01:13:43,435
in a balanced way, for each patient.

478
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:47,623
And that is what the VES is doing.

479
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:58,396
-When I take the repertorization, the analysis, they are always lots of numbers

480
01:13:58,496 --> 01:14:09,617
shown in the second row and I do understand that the first and second apply grades, degrees

481
01:14:11,595 --> 01:14:16,508
but then you get up to 1100 or 3900. What does it tell me?

482
01:14:19,616 --> 01:14:23,825
What can I do with it? What can I use it for?

483
01:14:23,925 --> 01:14:40,288
-Anya is asking about numbers which appear if you look, for example, here.

484
01:14:41,163 --> 01:14:49,640
These figures indicate the importance of the rule which is applied, prominence in this case

485
01:14:50,229 --> 01:14:57,547
for the remedy under which it is written. So it is just the results of a calculation

486
01:14:58,379 --> 01:15:04,800
and the higher the number in this case, the more the remedy is prominent.

487
01:15:09,067 --> 01:15:15,879
It means the most prominent remedy for these 11 symptoms, is Lachesis.

488
01:15:15,979 --> 01:15:22,421
If it would be a different method, the number would just indicate the relevance of the remedy.
