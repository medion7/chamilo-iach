1
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:29,150
We are quite close with the ideas of psychiatrists and psychologists and we would like

2
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:41,070
to hear their opinion and I would like to invite and have 1-2 hours of their subject.

3
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:47,200
A good person who is organized the subject and we can be learning.

4
00:00:52,460 --> 00:01:02,550
I would like to give you, as you progressing in the knowledge,

5
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:17,980
to give you some extra exposure but I must tell you because unfortunate things are happening.

6
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:30,980
You know that in Greece there was a Committee formed by 6 Professors of Theology,

7
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:46,310
a few Professors of Medicine plus some medical people, a few priests and a few Judges

8
00:01:46,410 --> 00:02:01,680
who studied my teachings in order to see whether this was a heresy.

9
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:25,570
Can you imagine the stupidity and the darkness and everything that goes with all that.

10
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:42,310
They invited some of my students to defend me and they did not invite me of course.

11
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:59,790
The fanaticism they said that was going on was unbelievable and it reminded the Dark Ages,

12
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:47,790
the Inquisition. They asked my students to betray my teaching.

13
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:59,890
They said do you agree with everything that George says?

14
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:07,890
They pushed them and they said, maybe he is wrong.

15
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:18,710
Their greatest problem was that some phrases which I had in the books reminded them

16
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,330
of Indian philosophy.

17
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:34,700
And this is really very bad but can you imagine 30 people, serious, Professors

18
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:43,450
of different universities sitting there and scrutinizing every word.

19
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,220
They need Mother Tincture.

20
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:29,220
This religion is good, no my religion is the absolute truth, the orthodox.

21
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:40,030
But another religion states similar things and another religion but this is nothing

22
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,290
to do with religion.

23
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:53,480
This is pure Medicine but you cannot talk about Medicine and forget about the human being.

24
00:05:53,580 --> 00:06:00,080
You take this human being somewhere. Where do you take him?

25
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:06,580
What is religion and what is to be free?

26
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,580
You understand my problem?

27
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:18,530
If somebody asks this and we have to do some yoga exercises, I say please.

28
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:36,010
I had the teaching course last year, they said this is a meeting of the gurus of the world.

29
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:47,960
I honestly I never had a follower, not only I never had a follower but most of my students

30
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:56,770
they hate me. After they learn what they learn, they don't want to say good morning.

31
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,010
I always let everybody free. You go.

32
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,330
I never had this idea of guru. I don't want this.

33
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:11,830
In America when I was first going, they said George you are great.

34
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:23,010
I said forget it, not me. I sent them away. I don't want followers.

35
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:33,000
No you are a guru. You make me a guru. Why? Because you want it, because it fits you.

36
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:38,750
It's Greek Orthodox. Yes, I was born Greek Orthodox, I am Greek Orthodox

37
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:43,160
but after that I cannot think? I have to stop thinking?

38
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:59,930
But the society is built like that. Whoever tries to do something beyond the establishment

39
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:03,770
you have to be killed...

40
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:16,120
As I said I would like to invite a priest, a Greek Orthodox priest

41
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:21,790
but I would like to invite also a Catholic priest and I would like to invite also

42
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:26,020
a Jewish priest and I would like to invite an Islamic priest.

43
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:38,510
If this the idea discussing what is the higher purposes of life, which Hahnemann says?

44
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:44,680
What is this according to you and according to you, that would be a great discussion,

45
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:48,680
listening to different ideas.

46
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:53,780
And how this is connected with health?

47
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:59,440
How you can become more healthy or how you can become more sick?

48
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:05,930
And these are serious issues that a healer should understand very well

49
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:10,260
before he tries to cure somebody.

50
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:29,600
Because you are doing like that. You take away suffering and also to understand that

51
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:40,110
if this is happening, it is not you. It was given a system. It is Homeopathy. It is not you.

52
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:45,750
You deserve it because you learned, because you apply yourself

53
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:51,210
and you learned properly and you deserve some respect.

54
00:09:51,950 --> 00:10:00,400
But to feel that I have resurrected the dead, that is wrong ideas that maybe

55
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:11,400
some of my students are getting into that trap. It is not me. The great thing is Homeopathy. It's not me.

56
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:26,390
The great thing is that we have been given that information, which we can utilize

57
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:32,400
and perhaps we can perfect it.

58
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:40,560
But I never felt that it was that I was doing something.

59
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:49,810
It is Homeopathy applied more correctly perhaps than others.

60
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:56,570
That's why you are here, to learn the correct way of applying Homeopathy.

61
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:02,670
So from that point of view also we have to be trained because the patients come back

62
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:08,490
and they tell you I pray for you.

63
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:14,480
Instead of praying to god, I pray for you. I say what?

64
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:21,500
You have to understand where we stand each one of us.

65
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:28,750
These are important issues that have to be discussed with spiritual people.

66
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:37,510
Because they will give you the dimension of you being very small and nothing in the Cosmos,

67
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:48,190
in eternity. They will give another dimension as a healer.

68
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:57,200
Then you are afraid to invite them in case some crazy people will say he is a heretic.

69
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:02,610
-Is there any way we can just help you, to write to somebody to tell them

70
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:10,450
we are better doctors since we learned from you? Is there any possibility?

71
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:24,400
-My students said it was so futile fighting with these fanatics. 30 fanatics.

72
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:31,610
Actually to their credit, the Theologians said wait a moment, we understand that

73
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:36,600
this is an issue between established Medicine and Homeopaths.

74
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,610
You better solve the problem between yourselves.

75
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:51,360
We don't feel it has something to do with us but some priests who have some interest on that,

76
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:57,100
on lower level, they said no, no, no we'll kill them.

77
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:18,860
One of these Professors wrote a booklet 50-60 pages which was published in 200.000 copies

78
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:26,610
and it was sent to all the Greek churches to be distributed by the priests

79
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:36,300
of these churches to the people, so they don't go near Homeopathy because it is a heresy.

80
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:47,380
Who pays for these 200.000 booklets? Never mind the church, who is behind the church?

81
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:53,020
So the Theologians said forget it, this is not our issue.

82
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:59,780
You seem to have a problem between yourself, you better find this

83
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:07,210
and settle the matter between yourselves.

84
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,570
-When was that? Last year?
-Not last year, last month.

85
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,180
-I have the feeling that the problem is information.

86
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,860
I am a practitioner and I wrote to the Association of practitioners and offered them

87
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:37,110
to inform them with a lecture about Classical Homeopathy.

88
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:45,330
I worked for four weeks and set up transparencies to demonstrate cases out of my clinic.

89
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:53,520
I went to the seminar room in a hotel, which was in fact quite big,

90
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:58,690
and the chair people of the practitioners Association were present at 9 o'clock

91
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:04,680
because in the beginning they wanted to talk for something about the prizes you get

92
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,600
for the things you do as a practitioner.

93
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:18,010
All and all 6 people were present and the chair people were speaking from 9 o'clock to 1 o'clock,

94
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:23,000
after that 3 people left, which leaves 3 remaining and I said I won't speak

95
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:27,010
if only 3 people are here because I think it's not worth anything.

96
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:32,750
The 3 people told me to speak because they had come extra for Classical Homeopathy.

97
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:39,540
So I spoke about Classical Homeopathy this afternoon for 3 people and I only had 2 hours given.

98
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:47,180
I then received a letter from a chair person of the Association.

99
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,600
He apologized and he said they had written to 300 practitioners

100
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:58,610
and that for this kind of event no people are interested.

101
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:06,620
He asked for money, I wanted to do it for free. He sent me a check over 300 marks.

102
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:20,280
-I feel the interest for Classical Homeopathy is increasing and in Germany it's going to explode,

103
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,280
very soon you will see an explosion.

104
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:26,030
What I was talking is a different matter.

105
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:41,120
Whether the authorities will strangulate us from really going into a discussion

106
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:45,360
in which we will really be free and productive.

107
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:51,700
You can ask now any question you like.

108
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,540
-I would like to stress on the point my colleague made.

109
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,790
I think since we are an international group, I just know from other things

110
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:15,270
that if letters come from Israel, from America, from Switzerland, from Germany, from Malta

111
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:19,620
I think this could be a chance we could stress on.

112
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,130
If you think it's a good idea...

113
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:32,280
-It's a good idea if you write letters and you send it to the Academy here,

114
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:39,550
a personal letter to me saying how much you are learning, appreciating...

115
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:47,520
Maybe it's necessary to show these letters and say this is what is happening.

116
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:57,030
I never care about these things but the attacks are coming as the Movement

117
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:02,070
is growing is unbelievable.

118
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,650
Can you believe that they were 6 judges,

119
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:16,640
Professors of Theology and Professors of Medicine discussing whether the church

120
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:21,240
must excommunicate me because I'm a heretic?

121
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:32,630
They wanted to make a proposal to the Synod to excommunicate me

122
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:36,210
and I said it's ridiculous even to think it.

123
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:47,800
They didn't go into that trap the Theologians because this trap was set by other means.

124
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,310
It's very interesting.

125
00:18:54,230 --> 00:19:01,620
-I had 7 patients who are members of a free church and they were not permitted to come

126
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,220
and see me anymore because they were told that Hahnemann was a heretic.

127
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:21,620
-We have to be aware that they will not directly attack the people with whom they have problems.

128
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,710
They will go through that way.

129
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:33,080
The attack will come through religious groups which are manipulated.

130
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:44,120
There is a priest who has except of his children, he has another 15 children, 20 children.

131
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:52,630
He says these are my children. On the excuse of these are my children, he receives checks.

132
00:19:52,730 --> 00:20:06,640
Nobody knows how much, never mind whether they are declared to feed your children.

133
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:14,290
Who is sending the check, a big check is also a big friend and says these fools

134
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,950
who are teaching this and that...

135
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:21,470
And then the priest of course becomes very fanatic.

136
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:27,110
Who sends the checks? Maybe the pharmaceutical company

137
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:35,620
and though the priest is very eager to fight this heresy.

138
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:40,830
Do you see how the idea is coming? And it's going to come more and more.

139
00:20:51,790 --> 00:21:03,240
-I think there is one good side. If they gather like this they really seem to have fear

140
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:10,210
to lose their power and I think in Germany you would be even in more danger

141
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:24,050
because we have the pharmaceutical industry, very strong. I'm concerned about this.

142
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:39,860
-I think there is a big difference because if it's going by the pharmaceutical industry,

143
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,350
everybody knows what they want.

144
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:55,960
But if they do it in this kind of spiritual, it's another level and people don't realize.

145
00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:05,190
And now I realize we can do something from outside, some pressure on these

146
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:08,690
stupid Greek people, excuse me.

147
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:18,840
Because one thing can really do something to them is to say you are stupid.

148
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:26,100
The whole Europe is very happy to have this possibility and Greeks...

149
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:31,510
You know this  is always the story with the prophet in his own...

150
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:37,590
I think we, as international group, from outside, we have much more possibility

151
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:42,350
to make some pressure in political or another way.

152
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:48,090
So we must find ideas or what we can do from outside.

153
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:57,840
-If you can ask your friends, especially medical doctors, who are sympathetic to write letters

154
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:06,840
and pressurize because the attack is very insidious. It's not direct.

155
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:14,770
You understand what they are doing. Influencing the people.

156
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:25,010
The moment that it was announced that I got this Award, in 15 days it came into the Press

157
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:38,100
that the Prime Minister of Greece most probably died because a student of mine,

158
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:43,690
a student of George Vithoulkas, has given him Arsenicum.

159
00:23:48,450 --> 00:24:01,930
First pages all the news papers said excavate the Prime Minister and try to see if in his blood,

160
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:07,450
take him out of the grave, 5 months later.

161
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:16,360
They were saying to see whether he died from Arsenicum poisoning.

162
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,370
The issues are quite serious.

163
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:38,670
-Last month before I came here are published in Bulgaria a 16 pages book,

164
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:43,940
which is 'Homeopathy for the patient'. It has exactly 16 chapters.

165
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:55,020
Each one is just one page with very short and very exact explanation of what it is all about.

166
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:02,260
While we were listening about such leaflets which are distributed through the church,

167
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:07,770
it is our right to make something which will be better.

168
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:13,780
I think your first book 'Homeopathy for the New Man' was good for the time.

169
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:22,770
But now it is time for you to make something to explain to people what is Homeopathy about.

170
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:32,940
This is not at all difficult, you can do it and all of us we can market it.

171
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:40,930
We can distribute it in our countries, in Greece and elsewhere and so nobody will have the right

172
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:44,180
to say George Vithoulkas is telling nonsense.

173
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:50,430
This is what you are telling, it will be absolutely scientific, we can make an advisory board

174
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:55,480
of some doctors and that's it.

175
00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:02,930
-What I wanted to say is you are not the only one they want to aim at.

176
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:14,030
What you spread is that Homeopathy is a Medicine of freedom.

177
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:23,670
They have always been movements and interests of certain groups of people

178
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:29,270
who do not want people to be in freedom. They want to keep them in a kind of captivity.

179
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:35,950
And so it's only logical that the more Homeopathy spreads, the larger the pressure is going to be.

180
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:39,510
What it really shocked me is that I heard from one participant of this course

181
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:46,100
that in certain States of the United States it is forbidden to work with homeopathic remedies.

182
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:55,260
The doctors would have their licenses away.

183
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:01,790
-There was only one State in North Carolina, as far as I know.

184
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:14,590
My student was the victim of this attack and we organized a counter attack.

185
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:20,810
I was the one who organized the counter attack and finally he won.

186
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:26,960
Actually in that State there is a law now practicing Homeopathy.

187
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:30,390
The Medical Association was attacking very much.

188
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:42,540
-I think the best that we can do for Homeopathy is to become the best possible.

189
00:27:52,560 --> 00:28:00,960
I would like to ask you not to write lots of books in favor of Homeopathy

190
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:08,560
but to continue your beautiful Materia Medica to help us to become better homeopaths.

191
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:25,030
-I'll tell you something. In 1970 P. Smith of Geneva was in Athens visiting the Center.

192
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:30,280
At that time there were 10 doctors who were my students, myself...

193
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:39,270
And I said to him, at 1970 I had done nothing yet, I said to him

194
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:49,620
sir what can we do to spread Homeopathy?

195
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:56,520
Now I'm very tired from all these years but you can imagine in 1970.

196
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:03,280
The energy and the passion I wanted anybody who would come next to me to become a homeopath.

197
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:06,370
There was no chance.

198
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:14,530
He was an old man and by that time with his hat and his rings.

199
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:24,700
He had 10 rings and he was looking like a magician. I said to him what can we do?

200
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:33,150
He said don't do anything, just practice correctly Homeopathy and Homeopathy will spread.

201
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:41,700
Now looking back I was wondering if I had done nothing, I could by that time

202
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:49,020
be the magician of the tribe, as they call me.

203
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:52,930
Anybody would come to be treated, thank you...

204
00:29:53,030 --> 00:30:00,840
If I had continue to do that without teaching anybody, trying what I tried

205
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:09,260
which the story is quite long, where it would be Classical Homeopathy at the moment?

206
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:17,110
I would be the magician of the tribe, no question but what about Homeopathy?

207
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:24,020
So you are right in what you said, from that point of view everyone

208
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:30,260
should become the best possible but at the same time we don't have to keep the knowledge

209
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:36,430
to ourselves but we have to give it out also.

210
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:44,340
Because that is the way it can spread and it can grow. And it is very difficult.

211
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:53,450
You won't believe that teaching is much more difficult than practicing.

212
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:59,530
Teaching takes a lot of energy and a lot of sacrifice.

213
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,780
Thank you.

214
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:31,420
I need your appreciation, there is no question in order to take some strength to continue.

215
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:39,670
Otherwise it is very difficult and if I see that the teaching is appreciated.

216
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:43,930
Then of course I'll have more energy to do more.

217
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:52,760
That's why from that point of view is very nice to hear this appreciation.

218
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:59,510
I take this opportunity actually to thank you also from my heart for coming

219
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,300
and takin this pilgrimage.

220
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:10,250
Because I feel it's a pilgrimage, it's taking all this energy and time and costs

221
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:24,760
to come here and learn something which I love very much and I try to inspire the same love to you.

222
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:33,510
I take this opportunity to thank all these people who are working in this set up

223
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:41,360
and especially those who are sweating even much more than me, which are the translators.
