1
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:26,940
I want to speak about something for the first time.

2
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,050
I have never spoken about this subject before.

3
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:52,350
I want to speak about the importance of the function of human imagination

4
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:59,680
and the role it plays in human health.

5
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:15,940
It is important for you that you are dealing with the health of the people

6
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:30,090
to understand that the function, the faculty, the possibility of the human brain

7
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:43,930
to imagine, to fantasize is one of the most  high functions of the human brain.

8
00:01:46,930 --> 00:02:08,920
Imagining, fantasizing is also important for rejuvenating the human body.

9
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:24,740
Without imagination, if the faculty of imagination reduces to the extent

10
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:37,990
that a human being does not lose the possibility to imagine,

11
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:54,690
from that moment onwards it starts a process of degeneration of the human organism.

12
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:08,940
I want to give you some examples. For instance, in depression.

13
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:20,850
A stage of depression is what people call indifference. I'm not interested about anything.

14
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:30,460
And you know that when you hear that by a patient,

15
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,310
you are going to have a very difficult case.

16
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:49,810
If you examine such an individual, whether anything excites them, they will say nothing.

17
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:57,970
But in order an individual to be excited about something,

18
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:06,140
he has to have the faculty of imagining, the possibility of imagination.

19
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:29,210
Where is life in its fullest sense, there is always an area of the brain,

20
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:55,820
which is easily excitable and produces pictures, ideas and plans for the future.

21
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:20,710
You remember the other day I said that each area of the brain can be excited

22
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:28,480
in a positive or a negative way. Every area has both possibilities.

23
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,620
The same with imagination.

24
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:41,290
The area of the brain which is excited easily that produces the  phenomenon of imagining

25
00:05:41,390 --> 00:06:01,870
can be positive or negative. Therefore imagination is a faculty that can bring a human being

26
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:10,230
in its highest possible spiritual stage.

27
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:29,790
It is through imagination, through this faculty that a human being is entering the world of ideas,

28
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:41,980
which is the highest area where we can enter as humans.

29
00:06:43,980 --> 00:07:04,980
Through imagination also is that a human being can go totally away from the positive ideas.

30
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:19,330
It goes to the other side and then we have the problems that we call mental problems.

31
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:30,880
But I want to draw your attention to a fact which you all know,

32
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:36,900
especially those who are working with mental patients.

33
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:51,650
Mental patients usually you will see they have delusions, acoustic or visual.

34
00:07:54,900 --> 00:08:05,310
That means they are living in a world of imagination.

35
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:12,400
They are living in - what we call - a not a real world.

36
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:34,880
By entering in this state what happens is that the energy that is experienced

37
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:45,230
by the human who is entering in this world, it is unbelievable energy.

38
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:58,790
I have seen and you may have similar experiences manic depressive people,

39
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:15,140
when they are entering the manic phase, their energy is increased unbelievably.

40
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:31,790
I have seen cases in a manic state for days and days to go without sleep, without eating

41
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:38,390
and yet the energy which they produce is unbelievable.

42
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:53,960
They can go on day after day, night after night with one hour of sleep or even less sometimes,

43
00:09:54,060 --> 00:10:05,700
with very little food, no appetite but you see them moving around, talking, doing things,

44
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:12,800
live in the house, going out, asking people to have sex with them...

45
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:29,880
We have to ask where this energy is coming. What is the mechanism?

46
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:41,770
When an individual lives in a world of phantasy has such a big, huge energy

47
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:55,020
while at the same time the one who says in a depressive state, I'm totally indifferet.

48
00:10:55,530 --> 00:11:06,290
What you will see in such cases? Lack of energy invariably, total lack of energy.

49
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:24,790
When the person says Phosphoric acid state, Picric acid state, Stannum state,

50
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,390
Carbo vegetabilis state...

51
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:37,950
When these people say I'm exhausted and I don't care about anything at the same time

52
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:45,790
you see tiredness, extreme tiredness in their organism.

53
00:11:49,530 --> 00:12:02,040
They may be going to bed and though they are tired hardly they can sleep a few hours.

54
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:11,930
And they become more tired, sleepless and they never have enough sleep to recover.

55
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:16,780
This is what they feel. If I could sleep, I would recover my energy.

56
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:33,450
I want you to keep this in mind and I will go to another state when you were children.

57
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:45,830
You know how children use their imagination in everything they are doing.

58
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:59,530
Children live and do things through their imagination and what we observe with children?

59
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:02,720
We observe a lot of energy.

60
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:17,290
They go up and down, they play, they imagine things and a lot of energy is flowing.

61
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:49,610
I'm sure from your experience everyone will remember that in your young years more

62
00:13:49,710 --> 00:14:03,190
and in the childhood but especially later on if you had problems to fall asleep,

63
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:14,190
you would have to imagine something pleasant and with this kind of imagination

64
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:28,270
the organism would be settled down and calmed down and eventually enter the state of sleep.

65
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:49,450
Then you will have to ask why do we have to fall asleep in order to keep on living.

66
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:56,510
They say according to statistics that 7days without any sleep,

67
00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:06,420
if they wake up a person by force, if they wake him up for 7 days, the 8th day he will die.

68
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:12,270
If they don't allow him to sleep for one minute for 7 days, he dies.

69
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:25,020
Therefore the entering of that state is absolutely necessary for our existence.

70
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:40,360
Now we have to understand what is the connection between fantasizing and sleep.

71
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:54,530
Is fantasizing, imagining a kind of a dream state?

72
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:13,270
In medicine we have an expression, which says a person is day dreaming.

73
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:29,820
Therefore we have to connect this day dreaming, this imagination,

74
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:39,960
the possibility we have to imagine things with the very existence of life.

75
00:16:45,100 --> 00:17:01,670
But at the same time we say this person is out of his mind, he is totally crazy.

76
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:12,040
Also we say this in cases of manic depression.

77
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:19,570
A manic state you see and you get frightened.

78
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:31,590
People are in a kind of ecstasy and imagination is in its fullest function.

79
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,180
And a lot of energy is coming in.

80
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:57,330
A mechanism happens in the brain that clicks and allows what we call our logic ability

81
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:11,830
to go to sleep and the organism is left without its ability to logically do things.

82
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:23,160
When you enter a dream state, you know that logic does not work anymore.

83
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,660
You say I want to leave, I want to go away but you cannot go away,

84
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:40,010
somebody is behind you and you cannot run. So you are left to what?

85
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:59,760
You are giving up your ego to another state of being without control anymore.

86
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,500
You don't have the control.

87
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:15,340
So the moment that you lose the control, the ego, the energy is flowing.

88
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:30,260
I have said something wrong.

89
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:50,580
I'm really examining things maybe that are a little bit on the beyond.

90
00:19:51,600 --> 00:20:05,740
But I examine them in such an analytical way that maybe we can be reaching conclusions

91
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:17,260
about human health and find parameters to evaluate who is really healthy

92
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:25,420
and who is really sick, which is something very useful for us when we treat patients.

93
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:34,940
Many times I have received questions from students saying tell us

94
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:43,360
what is a natural symptom and what is a pathological symptom?

95
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:54,440
Where pathology starts?

96
00:20:54,940 --> 00:21:02,850
I have been asked many times and I try every time to give an answer.

97
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:16,600
But unless we go into the depth of the issues to understand really what is happening,

98
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:20,940
we will always know half truths.

99
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:45,260
Didn't it ever cross your mind the question why do I have to sleep?

100
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:59,520
When I was young I was full of imagination. Unfortunately I don't have it now.

101
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:09,170
I was full of this, imagining the life of different things,

102
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:16,900
which are happening in the mind of a child who is very happy.

103
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:26,830
Tomorrow I will do this, I'll meet that girl, she is beautiful, I like her...

104
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:41,580
When it was time that I had to sleep, I said oh my god now I'm going to lose 7-8 hours

105
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,930
where I will be nonexistent.

106
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:54,320
I close my eyes and when I woke up it was 7 o'clock in the morning.

107
00:22:54,420 --> 00:23:00,440
Sometimes my aunt was coming, get up you have to go to work.

108
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:24,070
I want to connect the possibility of the imagination triggering a state,

109
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:30,670
which is between sleep and awareness.

110
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:43,070
If you trigger that state, then imagination, imagining things comes.

111
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:52,580
Because usually children go to sleep while they are imagining different things

112
00:23:54,420 --> 00:24:04,920
and as they imagine, they enter the sleep. And then the dreams come.

113
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:12,420
What are the dreams? Another question.

114
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:22,120
Jung says it's the collective consciousness, the collective sub-consciousness.

115
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:36,280
Different people have tried to explain what is this plane of dreams

116
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:48,110
and what is the connection between dreams and our lives and symbolic way of dreams

117
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:50,300
and how you explain them.

118
00:24:52,290 --> 00:25:05,200
What is interesting for us as healers to know is that imagination can be triggered

119
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,040
and it's a good thing.

120
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:12,800
How imagination can be triggered?

121
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:20,270
In children you don't need much.

122
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:28,030
A child can find very easy ways to trigger his imagination.

123
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:39,770
As logic becomes prominent in our life, imagination is reduced and more reduced.

124
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:54,130
And maybe it will be totally reduced and that's a very bad state of affairs.

125
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,710
Because no more flow of energy.

126
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:12,210
The moment that you enter an imagining stage, which is pleasant, you have flow of energy.

127
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:20,880
The moment that you enter a stage where there is no imagination, the flow of energy stops.

128
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:45,440
Now the question is if this is so, fantasizing or imagining is the highest form of stage

129
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:48,450
in which the human being can enter.

130
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:56,460
You can enter the highest stage through imagination.

131
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:14,860
What are the people who go away from society and go to monasteries

132
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:20,020
or even worse by themselves and they live for years?

133
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:30,870
And they do praying, they do spiritual exercises, what is the purpose?

134
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:43,430
The purpose is to refine the imagination and to stop the logical mind.

135
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:54,540
To make the logical mind calm down and let the imagination take hold of the individual.

136
00:27:56,790 --> 00:28:04,350
This is the experience that these people in the monasteries they have

137
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:11,660
because it comes an experience which is explosive. It's something beyond belief.

138
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,660
The energy that comes flows in. It is unbelievable.

139
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:28,150
And the sense of fulfillment is so great, so deep that they don't need anything else.

140
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:35,070
They don't need to communicate, they don't need to speak out about their experiences.

141
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:43,070
They are absolutely content with that divine state. How it came?

142
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:58,470
Through efforts, constants efforts to excite the imagination and to imagine

143
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:14,030
or to attain enlightenment - they call it - or to attain a unification with god.

144
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:18,400
Then suddenly the flow.

145
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:26,070
If you read the experiences of these people, you will see they are identical,

146
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:44,560
whether it's a Yogi or a Sufi or a Christian. The experience is the same.

147
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:53,930
They have entered a state of absolute bliss.

148
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:11,660
Who can do that? Here is the question. Be careful because a lot of people are trying.

149
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:27,580
Do you know the Beatles? The Beatles were some people who were singing...

150
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:51,640
Beatles were singers who due to the love they received from their audience,

151
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:58,390
they were entering from moment to moment such stage in the stage

152
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:05,640
while they were performing and everybody was getting the energy from that stage.

153
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:11,660
They were the first ones to realize this state is similar with yogis.

154
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,760
So let's go to India to meet the yogis.

155
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:29,240
They were the first popular people who left their country to go to meet the yogis.

156
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:45,650
They went to India but they met most probably the wrong yogis, the wrong guidance

157
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:54,640
and most probably they ended up taking some drugs, marihuana etc.

158
00:31:54,740 --> 00:32:03,740
And trying to bring about that state through artificial means.

159
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:23,250
If you try to do this, to stimulate this area through chemical drugs what happens?

160
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:35,410
All the areas are of double quality, positive and negative.

161
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:43,540
You stimulate the area and the experience instead of being a fantastic experience,

162
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:47,690
it is an experience of going to hell.

163
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,710
I met a lot of people when I was in America with marihuana.

164
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:59,210
They came to tell me their experience and they were sick after that

165
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:04,740
with tremendous fear of going crazy.

166
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:17,040
So you have to be careful how we use all these chemicals

167
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:32,060
because we cannot stimulate areas of the brain in an unnatural way.

168
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:39,060
Because we're going to pay the price later on for sure.

169
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:45,960
The more you stimulate the brain and even if you get good experiences,

170
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:50,050
the more you will have the after effects.

171
00:33:53,800 --> 00:34:06,560
So what is a healthy imagination? This is what we should concern about?

172
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:20,950
Who can have and to what extent our brains can tolerate,

173
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:33,050
where are the limits we can tolerate going into this area of imagining?

174
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:43,470
Many people have tried and they went in the wrong way.

175
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:54,140
Then we have the mental problems that we see today.

176
00:34:56,390 --> 00:35:15,280
So a person of our western civilization who is today making the effort to become

177
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:28,780
a better human being, usually comes in contact with such movements, spiritual movements.

178
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:37,290
In which directions are given what you have to do in order to attain internal bliss,

179
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:39,800
enlightenment etc.

180
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:56,950
What I found out is that unless the whole organism is in a state of health as a whole,

181
00:35:57,050 --> 00:36:04,571
if he pushes himself hard to attain states which are not permissible

182
00:36:04,949 --> 00:36:07,489
because of his limitations of health,

183
00:36:07,642 --> 00:36:15,001
he will go astray and he will develop mental symptomatology.

184
00:36:19,225 --> 00:36:34,977
So the imagination is our door to whatever is the highest in our understanding

185
00:36:36,801 --> 00:36:43,474
but we have to have healthy organism to try to open that door.

186
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:59,450
That is why Homeopathy which is bringing back a kind of balance in the organism

187
00:36:59,762 --> 00:37:12,202
is so Important at this moment for a society which has gone astray totally to come back

188
00:37:12,553 --> 00:37:18,881
to its natural rules.

189
00:37:22,049-->00:37:29,585
If your brain has a problem in the area when you stimulate it,

190
00:37:29,929 --> 00:37:39,433
it will open up the problematic area. It will not open the correct area.

191
00:37:39,697 --> 00:37:47,689
It will not open up the positive side of the imagination.

192
00:37:48,153 --> 00:37:56,500
It will open the negative side of imagination.

193
00:38:05,684 --> 00:38:15,460
In this world in which we live today, the pornography because it's on the news...

194
00:38:16,652 --> 00:38:37,588
Every day they catch people with pornographic stuff, with disgusting functions,

195
00:38:38,724 --> 00:38:42,115
with children, with babies.

196
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:55,189
Can you imagine now how these people are driven to such unbelievable actions

197
00:38:56,348 --> 00:39:04,259
because their imagination took the wrong turn?

198
00:39:04,556 --> 00:39:09,500
What happened and our civilization is in such terrible state?

199
00:39:10,252 --> 00:39:17,428
Because we lost the possibility to be children.

200
00:39:25,564-->00:39:36,396
You hear Tomas, what he said was unbelievable.

201
00:39:36,683 --> 00:39:44,156
He said I pray for the humanity, for those I love. He was very honest.

202
00:39:45,492 --> 00:40:01,908
Because in the child's soul there is this element of purity.

203
00:40:02,116 --> 00:40:09,451
We consider this child as non normal yet.

204
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:20,989
Yet some functions which he is experiencing from his brain are very healthy

205
00:40:21,204 --> 00:40:27,955
and are healthier than ours as grown-ups.

206
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:45,220
He says I want to throw a bomb for the injustice. The way he means it it's all right.

207
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:54,325
He prays at the same time for the good of society. Fantastic.
