00:06:10,562 --> 00:06:15,218
Dear Chairman, Dear Colleagues, Ladies and Gentlemen,

2
00:06:17,186 --> 00:06:26,753
I would like to thank you and the organizing committee of the congress for the kind invitation.

3
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:36,881
It's my great honor and pleasure to be here and share with you some ideas and thoughts about homeopathy.

4
00:06:39,048 --> 00:06:44,824
As we all know, the evolution of medicine the last 20 years is phenomenal.

5
00:06:46,025 --> 00:06:51,192
In a similar way,the evolution of homeopathy is also impressive.

6
00:06:52,392 --> 00:07:03,183
As everybody understands I cannot prove to you anything within 20 minutes,

7
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:15,254
especially that Homeopathy is a science, but what I can do is to present to you some propositions concerning

8
00:07:15,622 --> 00:07:21,029
the homeopathic point of view and let you make your own evaluation.

9
00:07:22,678 --> 00:07:30,269
Some of the ideas that I will be presenting may look familiar to you…

10
00:08:11,843 --> 00:08:20,923
Some of the ideas that I will be presenting may look familiar to you some others may be surprising or controversial

11
00:08:22,106 --> 00:08:28,025
and I am sure also that a lot of important questions will be left unanswered .

12
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:37,322
Please do not jump into conclusions before you have investigated the matter more thoroughly.

13
00:08:42,433 --> 00:08:50,752
I want to make a statement from the very beginning so no misunderstanding could arise:

14
00:08:51,153 --> 00:09:00,120
Homeopathy does not claim to cure everything, and more specifically does not claim to cure

15
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,496
cases with deep and progressed chronic pathology.

16
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:15,503
But where is most useful is in functional disorders and also in the beginning of chronic diseases.

17
00:09:20,174 --> 00:09:30,461
So we have some dilemma in Medicine which everybody knows.

18
00:09:31,494 --> 00:09:40,692
Signs and symptoms are the expression of the defence mechanism in order to keep the homeostasis

19
00:09:41,053 --> 00:09:46,828
and should be respected and promoted rather than suppressed.

20
00:09:48,044 --> 00:09:54,076
This may be a new idea but it is a basic idea for Homeopathy.

21
00:09:54,277 --> 00:10:01,884
A typical example; fever should be promoted and allowed to complete its

22
00:10:02,331 --> 00:10:08,211
mission in inflammatory processes, not suppressed.

23
00:10:13,371 --> 00:10:21,434
The suppression of acute diseases may continue as a sub-acute inflammatory process,

24
00:10:21,867 --> 00:10:29,730
manifesting the genetic predisposition of the organism for chronic degenerative diseases.

25
00:10:31,289 --> 00:10:40,785
All chronic diseases therefore are characterized by parameters of a sub-acute inflammatory process.

26
00:10:45,153 --> 00:10:54,905
Such chronic diseases are a substitute of the original inflammation and a continuation of the

27
00:10:55,144 --> 00:11:02,840
acute disease that was never parted from the organism and never really cured!

28
00:11:04,752 --> 00:11:13,815
For example acute tonsillitis, repeated tonsillitis, many times treated with antibiotics may end up in an

29
00:11:14,223 --> 00:11:26,151
individual with cluster headaches acute rheumatic fever as heart diseases etc.

30
00:11:32,814 --> 00:11:43,685
The basic law of Homeopathy is that likes cure likes. It means that the cure of a disease is

31
00:11:44,357 --> 00:11:51,476
accomplished by remedies that are capable of producing in healthy individuals similar

32
00:11:51,876 --> 00:12:07,531
symptoms to those of the disease. What are the remedies that are using? All these remedies

33
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:16,483
have been formed by provings. Remedies which have been given to healthy individuals and

34
00:12:17,691 --> 00:12:25,754
provided a symptomatology of this remedy and all these corrected symptoms constitute the

35
00:12:26,002 --> 00:12:34,410
homeopathic pharmacopeia called Materia Materia. At this point I may say that for instance

36
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:47,401
all the side effects of conventional Medicine drugs would constitute for us indication for a cure

37
00:12:48,112 --> 00:12:59,392
for giving this remedy for side-effects this remedy causes, in very minute doses.

38
00:12:59,889 --> 00:13:07,080
The minimum dose is another main principle for Homeopathy.

39
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:20,375
This is the most disputed part, as Homeopathy is prescribing remedies in infinitesimal doses.

40
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:31,286
You may have your doubts with such minute doses.

41
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:41,485
But if you turn to allergiology, where an infinitesimal dose of an allergen

42
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:50,581
can produce a devastating effects upon an organism which is sensitive towards this allergen

43
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:59,540
then you may also understand that the homeopath is searching to find what is this particular

44
00:13:59,812 --> 00:14:06,035
remedy to which the individual is very sensitive and by giving them minute dose it can

45
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:15,563
produce an impressive reaction. The symptoms of the disease during the process of a cure,

46
00:14:17,035 --> 00:14:27,178
this is another important law in which we have experience, disappear in the reverse order of

47
00:14:27,435 --> 00:14:37,395
their coming. That means treating tonsillitis causes headache and the person comes with

48
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:45,761
cluster headaches. If you successfully treat the person with cluster headaches then the

49
00:14:46,057 --> 00:14:56,249
organism will go back to the state where the organism was infected by tonsillitis.

50
00:15:00,896 --> 00:15:08,856
The main difference between conventional medicine and homeopathy is the individualization of the

51
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:15,199
treatment. We don’t have remedies for diseases, we have remedies for patients.

52
00:15:16,231 --> 00:15:23,359
The target is curing the patient in its entire pathology and not only in its local pathology.

53
00:15:24,319 --> 00:15:35,927
This is accomplished by stimulating the defence mechanism by the similar remedy.

54
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:46,605
We collect all symptomatology, mental, emotional and physical of an organism and we try to find which is

55
00:15:46,886 --> 00:15:54,637
the remedy that has produced a similar pathology when it was proved in healthy individuals.

56
00:16:00,141 --> 00:16:17,171
By the term defence mechanism we mean the entire immune system and for Hahnemann it was called the vital force.

57
00:16:19,468 --> 00:16:25,091
It’s equal to the energy complex of the organism according to to the last findings of science.

58
00:16:29,618 --> 00:16:37,498
According to other experience there are several layers of health.

59
00:16:38,962 --> 00:16:45,018
4 main groups and 3 levels within each group.

60
00:16:47,562 --> 00:16:58,233
In order to define in which level of health a person is we have several parameters.

61
00:17:06,368 --> 00:17:12,032
One of the main parameters is the condition of the acute infections.

62
00:17:13,728 --> 00:17:20,487
Maybe it has not been observed so far but it is my experience that very

63
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:25,270
healthy individuals are seldom affected by acute diseases.

64
00:17:26,367 --> 00:17:33,158
If the level of health starts coming down we see mostly staphylococcal infections.

65
00:17:34,022 --> 00:17:41,374
If the level goes ever further down we see frequent yearly acutes.

66
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:52,085
As you go downer acutes by Proteus, Pseydomonas, viral infections,

67
00:17:53,006 --> 00:18:02,828
fungal infections, lower down, very frequent acutes including inhospital infections.

68
00:18:04,557 --> 00:18:16,956
At this point we see a cessation of acute conditions. The organism cannot raise high fever anymore.

69
00:18:21,396 --> 00:18:33,451
Once this has happened there is a manifestation of chronic condition with mild acutes with

70
00:18:33,795 --> 00:18:45,754
very low fever. As we go down very seldom mild acutes appear and in level 9 we see no acutes

71
00:18:46,345 --> 00:18:59,617
anymore. In the last levels of health we see no acutes with high fever, yet when a fever

72
00:18:59,857 --> 00:19:07,409
develops, indicates the end of life. It’s the last effort of the organism to survive.

73
00:19:08,384 --> 00:19:14,207
In medicinal hospitals, before death some acutes are developing.

74
00:19:15,808 --> 00:19:21,623
If the above concepts are correct, we may assume

75
00:19:22,295 --> 00:19:35,446
that we have a new doctrine about diseases expressed as a “Continuum” of a Unified Theory of Diseases.

76
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:49,902
Whether the above “propositions” constitute a scientific system or not has still to be decided.

77
00:19:51,222 --> 00:19:57,373
Needless to say, that these are experiences of thousands of medical doctors

78
00:19:58,052 --> 00:20:08,140
whose belief is that a healing system has to rely on what is understood today as evidence based medicine.

79
00:20:08,589 --> 00:20:10,756
Thank you.
