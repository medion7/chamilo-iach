1
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:42,799
Asar. is a remedy that you will need in cases of nervous exhaustion.

2
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:58,209
The nervous system has been stressed and stressed and eventually breaks down and creates a super sensitivity

3
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:06,530
 on the nervous system, especially on the auditory nerve.

4
00:01:06,531 --> 00:01:14,450
But all the nervous system is in a state of excitement.

5
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:24,799
You feel that the person is going very soon to break down completely.

6
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:38,679
And the person himself will confess that 'maybe I'm jumping over to a new state' which is madness, craziness.

7
00:01:43,290 --> 00:02:03,319
This situation can be caused by an individual pushing himself, especially today. I think Asar. was not indicated 100 years ago.

8
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:13,499
But today with the idea of pushing, pushing ourselves into attaining and attaining and using the mind.

9
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:20,980
You get a child for instance, and she is good at school, the father and the mother are ambitious.

10
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:31,079
They say why don't you do some piano lessons? OK I do some piano lessons. And German is a language which is

11
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:43,079
quite contemporary, would you like to learn? OK I take some German lessons also. And then she tries and tries and

12
00:02:43,080 --> 00:03:01,009
there is a moment where the girl just gives up, the whole system is broken down and she cannot attend anymore anything.

13
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:13,449
How you will recognize that this is a case of Asar. and not a case of Calc.?

14
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:23,369
Calc. has similar state. They break down, they don't want to do anything anymore, they feel they are going crazy.

15
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:30,899
What will be the difference between Calc. and Asar.?

16
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:42,119
-That over sensitivity to noises. To the slightest noise.

17
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:53,619
-Very good. This is the difference. There is no Asar. case where she will not show sensitivity on the slightest noise.

18
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,540
And which is this noise?

19
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:16,120
 Especially the noise of the board, the scratch, the metallic noise.

20
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,120
They will close their ears.

21
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:45,919
If I ring the bell and it's an Asar. case she has to close the ears, she cannot take it, it's too strong.

22
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:54,819
Then what you see it's another element that you see in Asar. in comparison with Calc.?

23
00:04:54,820 --> 00:05:02,050
That Asar. is really a hysterical case.

24
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:19,799
Because you see the child is sitting there, playing with their fingers when they are talking.

25
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:30,280
 They don't realize what they are doing. They sit there, they look at you and the fingers.

26
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:45,519
 That shows the inner state of the child, the extreme anxiety, the extreme hyper sensitivity, what are you going to tell me now?

27
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:05,630
If you push the child, 'study!', this tone of voice it can destroy it.

28
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:17,129
You take the child to the bus, you are a little bit late and you tell the child 'hurry up', it is impossible.

29
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:23,779
 This pushing, this little bit of extra energy which he needs, he cannot put.

30
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:43,939
The idea is that you understand this situation and you can recognize it in cases of nervous exhaustion.

31
00:06:45,760 --> 00:07:06,279
You will see such cases with nervous diseases, with M.S., where there is this hypersensitivity and the nervous system is really affected.

32
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:10,800
It has now a damage done on the nervous system.

33
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:20,489
Then with this hypersensitivity of the
auditory nerve especially, that's the case.

34
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:53,149
This is very characteristic. The grownups will not do it like this but there is something called embarrassment.

35
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:19,039
You feel the person is embarrassed. He does not know whether this is right or what to say and you feel the reactions

36
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:27,239
which are coming from the outside, whatever the stresses cannot be handled.

37
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:42,220
I have a feeling, I have a fear or an anxiety.

38
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:54,929
This is the state, shivers from emotions but
you have to understand the whole situation.

39
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:07,340
It's not a coldness, it's the nervous system.

40
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:23,199
 This excitement inside and the pressure which we have out of the different duties we have to do.

41
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:35,949
Excitement, pressure, inability as a result, an inner hurriedness but she cannot run, she cannot do something quickly.

42
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:42,839
There is a hurried feeling inside without being able to perform.

43
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,710
It says 'noise causes chills'. You understand?

44
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,880
The whole nervous system is bothered.

45
00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:04,989
Their sensitivity reaches to the point sometimes, they think they're hearing noises.

46
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:28,440
This noise they cannot stand. Who cannot stand this noise? Nobody.

47
00:10:49,400 --> 00:11:03,379
Another state in which I have seen Asar. is indicated is states of what the Americans call allergic conditions,

48
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:15,369
allergic to anything. The Americans are allergic to anything, they have been exposed to too much pollution.

49
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:30,519
A case of American student had to give up her studies in America because she could not enter any laboratory.

50
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:44,779
Any laboratory on the medical premises will make her go into shivering, tremendous anxiety state and almost collapse.

51
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:54,700
You could see she was so sensitive, the nervous system, I cannot enter this.

52
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:04,159
The idea only of entering a place would drive her crazy.

53
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:24,039
You could not find that she will have a skin eruption or she will have an edema but she was performing as if she had all that.

54
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:38,309
So it is a hysteria which exaggerates the sensitivity of the nervous system. The nervous system cannot take

55
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:42,559
 the least pressure, the least aggression.

56
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:58,129
You understand with this kind of nervous system, with this kind of sensitivities, how she will behave in sexual matters.

57
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:07,560
Forget it.

58
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:22,359
The idea of kissing is impossible for her, even the child, even the parents to kiss the child. Leave me alone.

59
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:36,530
There is no energy on that level at all.

60
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:46,559
On the contrary they perceive or they are affected by close contact.

61
00:13:47,560 --> 00:14:01,599
It says 'aversion to be touched', 'aversion to sex', 'aversion to be kissed'. Any contact which irritates the nervous system.

62
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:11,219
Strong light they cannot tolerate. Strong noises they cannot tolerate. Strong wind they cannot tolerate.

63
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:17,249
Everything causes problems for them. Every stress.

64
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:30,330
And of course when the auditory nerve is in such a state for many years, may break down totally in deafness.

65
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:35,579
Hearing starts coming down. You cannot stay very long under that stress.

66
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:45,479
That state of over reaction of the nervous system it can be seen sometimes with the alcoholics.

67
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:59,979
These people present that kind of sensitivity and Asar. sometimes may help. Though the problem of alcoholism

68
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:13,740
is not an easy problem to tackle with Homeopathy. They need constant support from around society.

69
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:29,249
 Such support is very well given by the alcoholic anonymous because they create a society and within this society

70
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:35,759
each one supports each other. And they can get out of it.

71
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:10,149
With Homeopathy you can reduce a little bit the effect of the withdrawal syndrome but by giving a remedy, you cannot

72
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:13,239
 take them away from alcohol.

73
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:24,959
These cases also can be confused with the Phos. state.

74
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,199
In the previous group I did a miracle cure.

75
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:57,469
A woman was lying in the room with tremendous anxiety state, her husband was next to it and a few doctors were there

76
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:09,370
 and I came and saw her. She had a shock, she fell down and then she had tremendous anxiety, nobody knew what to do.

77
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:18,160
I just touched the extremities and I touched the knees. I saw the anxiety and I touched the knees.

78
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:26,269
In the cases of Phos. the knee area is very cold.

79
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:31,519
You touch a little bit down is warm, you touch the knee, very cold.

80
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:44,269
There were a few Italian doctors. I said you touch here, you touch there. Bring her Phos. Give Phos., she got up.

81
00:17:48,840 --> 00:18:00,999
Not always but many times. It is a characteristic and it is in Asar. also. But Phos. has it.

82
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:16,120
And of course I felt she was in a very anxious state. She was hyperventilating and she was very very anxious.

83
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:39,120
 Little things like that, because you don't ask any question. You just observe.

84
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:51,999
 Yesterday it was amazing also with her case when I got out of the class, one hour after we had spoken

85
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,959
still she was lying down there without being able to move.

86
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:15,519
And one dose of 30, not one dose even. She didn't touch, by the smell and she jumps up.

87
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:25,289
She was lying down there for one hour and ten minutes unable to move. Just the smell.

88
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:36,210
Uta was giving the remedy and before the pills touched the mouth.

89
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:45,600
She just jumped up.

90
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:31,679
-It says here: excessive sickness during pregnancy. Also in those state you have to have

91
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:38,479
the over sensitivity against hearing. Why does it come in pregnancy, do you know?

92
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:47,819
-I don't know but if you give it without
the general state, it will not work.

93
00:20:53,100 --> 00:21:03,739
What I'm trying to give you now here is always the main structure of the remedy which if you have it the effect is fantastic.

94
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:17,069
If you don't have it, it may still work the remedy like yesterday we gave on one symptom and a few other things, we gave him.

95
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,839
You are not happy.

96
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:45,479
If it acts the remedy, they say it's a placebo effect, it's not a placebo.

97
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:59,249
-Is it possible that Coff. would come in such a state like Asar. and except of nervous exhaustion what would be the difference then?

98
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:13,239
-The Coff.will have the trembling, will have the over excitement, ups and downs but the difference will be that

99
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:21,329
the mind produces constant ideas.

100
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:36,130
New ideas are coming, the mind is very very active. Here the mind is the opposite. It's almost inactive.

101
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:50,679
 You see the fear, you have to understand. 'I don't know what is going on, it is vertigo, dizziness, chills

102
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,359
 the mind is not working and I'm going crazy'.

103
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:06,064
That's why sometimes we say it looks like and I say no, no, there is nothing to do.

104
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:14,509
Because if you understand the essence of the remedy, then you cannot easily confuse the one with the other.

105
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:30,319
The other is talking, it will talk. The Coff. will talk to you in an excited state, very easy to be involved in a conversation.

106
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:39,450
These people they don't like conversation, they don't like to communicate.

107
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:44,759
Everything which is on the sphere of communication, forget it.

108
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:53,449
-George you mentioned M.S., what is your experience with Asar.?

109
00:23:53,550 --> 00:24:07,519
- I had two cases with M.S. which was the first remedy which took the case from here to there. Not cure.

110
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:17,719
M.S. is not an easy disease to cure and many times you can reach them up to a certain extent and then you may be

111
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:25,700
treating for 10 years, they stay in the
same level. Be happy. They stay and they walk.

112
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:35,559
  Unless you get them in the very beginning stages, then I have seen total cures, I mean 20 years

113
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:44,679
still I have cases which they have not relapsed in 20 years, you never know if they will still relapse.

114
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:52,799
But I have seen some cases in the beginning stages where they have gone very well.

115
00:24:53,180 --> 00:25:06,559
But once the plaques are formed, the destruction of the nervous cells is there, forget it, they will not repair.

116
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:19,999
They will stay with the edema and the process of inflammation of the nerve cells and the edemas, that will stop.

117
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,799
But the damage will remain to the point where you caught them.

118
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:42,839
-Is there any difference in Caust. and Nat-m.  in these cases because you mentioned this and we had one case in Vienna

119
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:55,129
 two years ago I think. Caust. case of M.S. which was quite far gone already. You mentioned that in the beginning

120
00:25:55,130 --> 00:26:01,939
you could keep the persons on a certain level. Does this goes for Asar. as well?

121
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:17,079
-This is for any remedy in M.S. when it's indicated, it's the correct remedy but will take the case up to a certain level, no further.

122
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:29,399
-No difference between any of the 3 remedies?
-No difference between the remedy. The same with Calc. or Sulph. or Lyc.

123
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:40,550
But you have to have that excessive sensitivity mostly on the nervous system.

124
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:56,169
Asar. is a remedy that today you will see a lot of cases. This nervous sensitivity is becoming more and more prominent

125
00:26:56,170 --> 00:27:03,119
 due to stresses that we have in life and the conscious effort we make.

126
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:19,949
I don't like to say things before I'm sure about, that the cases I have seen are cases conscientious people.

127
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:29,799
 That they voluntarily push themselves to the limit but I'm not sure that this is really so.

128
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:43,399
 It can happen to somebody else also but when I have seen that I have seen, you can say, ambitious people

129
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:47,839
 but it's not, if you write 'ambitious: Asar.' is wrong.

130
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,439
What you have to have is that state.

131
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:55,880
-Does the sensitivity to noise has to be in each and every case?

132
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:20,879
-The sensitivity to noise has to be there enough. It can be very extreme, like the one I described, or the patient will say

133
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,160
'I can't stand noises'.

134
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:41,600
There is a degree of course. But always in all cases yes I would say, it has to be that the auditory nerve is very sensitive.

135
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:54,359
-There is known a syndrome which is called Rett syndrome, that is autistic disease of children.

136
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:15,769
Rett is an Austrian psychiatrist and he described it. They are known about 20 children in Austria and Germany who have that.

137
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:28,239
It's an autistic disease very severe and you see that they have very much sensitivity against noise

138
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:37,079
and they have this always restless the hands on the body.

139
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:44,440
-These two signs are signs of Asar.

140
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:59,159
In autistic children of course I don't know how much you can improve but you can try, if you have a case like this

141
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:07,929
 a lower potency, constantly 3 times a day,
12X, going up every week 1 point.

142
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:19,069
In a 6 months treatment, you can evaluate because what you are saying is very typical.

143
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:30,519
-I tried with Q potencies and the sensitivity against noise diminished, it was not there and also the

144
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:36,240
restlessness of the hands and the child becomes more open. Before it was only looking through you

145
00:30:36,241 --> 00:30:42,959
 and after some time you got contact.

146
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:50,039
-You gave it already, I thought you were asking.
-Yes I gave it and there are some development but not cure.

147
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:10,949
-I believe that C potencies are more powerful. Go to C potencies, give it 3 times the day and give it for long period of time

148
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:18,779
 6 months every day and every week going up 1 step.

149
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:24,519
In 6 months observe the effect.

150
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:31,440
They are totally retarded.

151
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:50,890
Was anybody in Alonissos back 15 years ago when I saw this child totally retarded with epilepsy?

152
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:18,239
A child paralyzed 4 years old with epileptic fits, totally retarded, no contact at all and with Cic. it developed quite good

153
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:28,109
  to a certain extent where he could walk, no epileptic fits, couldn't communicate and he was a mongol child also.

154
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:37,119
But these cases you can improve so far.

155
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:49,919
I have battled with such a case for 8 years in the beginning of my career where all cases of this type were coming to me.

156
00:32:49,920 --> 00:33:01,669
Spastic children, autistic children, epileptic, cancer cases and neuro muscular diseases and I was battling with all these diseases.

157
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:14,119
With one child I battled, an autistic child. When he came he was 8 years old and pull down all my curtains.

158
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:30,169
Very aggressive. For 8 years. He brought out eventually bunches of warts. His whole legs were full of warts.

159
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:42,399
Eventually he was able to support himself. Even his mother at the age of 15 would give him some money and say go and buy this.

160
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:50,479
She would give a note, he would go there, give the money, take the thing and bring it to his mother.

161
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:04,069
No talking, no communication, only aggressiveness.

162
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:11,709
-On which symptoms did you give Cicuta on this child?

163
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:16,759
-You will see the video, so you have to recognize it.

164
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:37,949
-You said that you cannot cure alcoholics by Homeopathy. You were talking last seminars about cannabis

165
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:55,269
 the using of hashish. Do you think that you can cure this mental state that is the result of long use of cannabis with Homeopathy?

166
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:13,999
-Yes, you can cure but again if cannabis has been used for long periods of time and in big quantity, it always leaves

167
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:25,109
a mark on the brain. Always the brain will be deficient after that. It will not be able to concentrate

168
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:41,119
the concentration span will be small. And you will not be able to bring the brain back to its normal condition.

169
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:55,841
According to my understanding and experience, I never took myself but the experience of seeing cases with cannabis

170
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:07,653
it is that cannabis can have a very damaging effect on the brain if it was used regularly.

171
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:22,689
I don't agree at all with the idea of be free, let's smoke cannabis, it is like cigarette. It's not like cigarette.

172
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:33,589
Cigarette definitely damages but not as much as cannabis. Equal smoking of cigarettes and marihuana will kill the person.

173
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:40,039
20 cigarettes the day of marihuana will kill the person. Total killing in less than 10 years.

174
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:56,119
They are discussing of letting free marihuana. The same way with alcohol. They let free the alcohol and we have

175
00:36:56,120 --> 00:37:04,999
 how many millions of alcoholics? With marihuana the whole population will be subdued. If somebody wants to be

176
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:14,239
 the dictator of the world, he will say let give them marihuana and everyone will be happy.

177
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:28,140
It's a very easy way to subdue a population.

178
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:36,549
  The critical faculties, especially the critical faculties, are gone.

179
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:45,129
There is no discrimination, the brain cannot discriminate between good and bad. What is good and what is bad

180
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:48,800
what is true and what is false.

181
00:37:51,650 --> 00:38:04,999
 I say this for these younger children that we have here, so they can listen very carefully because it's not a simple issue

182
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:13,239
 as they want to present it. They smoke one cigarette of marihuana and say, nothing happened.

183
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:24,609
 Use 20 cigarettes a day and see what happens and come with the anxiety and the fear and the madness

184
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:37,759
 especially the fear we discussed it in Cann-i. The fear of insanity is something unbelievable, I'm going crazy.

185
00:38:52,430 --> 00:39:15,639
Tarent. is a remedy, you can say it's a remedy which acts on the nervous system, producing a lot of energy, a lot of force.

186
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:25,350
Excess energy that has to be spent.
How do they spend it?

187
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,759
  By motion and activity.

188
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:53,279
That's why it says restlessness is a tremendous issue and restlessness, hurriedness which is beyond belief.

189
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:13,649
You see a Tarent. case and they will do 7 things at one time. This is the idea, there is not enough time for me.

190
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:16,599
I have to do this, I have to do that.

191
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:27,959
They go make the bed, at the same time take the duster, it's a crazy situation.

192
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:38,779
Then they finish in half an hour, they don't have to do something more. Now what?

193
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:54,369
Of course there is energy there. They put the radio, the music and they start dancing by themselves.

194
00:40:54,370 --> 00:41:00,599
'You dance by yourself?' He says 'yes, loud music'.

195
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:12,000
One time I asked a Tarent. case
 just for the shake of the students.

196
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:26,479
 I said 'how loud you put the music?', He said, 'I will give you an example. I have some wardrobes, the music

197
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:37,068
 vibrates the wardrobes so they open'. Full decibel.

198
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:48,239
And the more loud the music, the better they feel and then the energy comes down.  It says 'better with music',

199
00:41:48,240 --> 00:42:00,230
it's not only better, it's very much better. A headache with strong music, a depression with strong music, and dancing.

200
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:13,200
And of course with all this energy which is there they cannot sleep.

201
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:20,709
 Their sleep may be 3 hours the day.

202
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:29,929
They get up and they don't know what to do. 3 o'clock in the morning they have to get up, what to do?

203
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:39,439
They say 'I go to the garden, I dig...etc'. They have to do things to expend the energy.

204
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:58,639
The main point with them is that they are bothered by others doing their job slowly.

205
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:13,399
In case somebody is in the same office and there is a Tarent. they look at him, taking this book, opening it slowly

206
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:22,999
putting it down and then he says 'I'm going crazy!'

207
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:34,569
Especially when they have employees. With a Tarent. boss nobody can stay because he wants to finish before

208
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:38,279
he has given the job. You have to finish the job.

209
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:47,519
And of course with all this energy aggression is there, very great aggression.

210
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:55,440
Just to give you an example, I remember a case.

211
00:43:55,730 --> 00:44:10,039
A man working in a bank and you know in a bank in a big hall like this, there are different desks.

212
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:22,439
I said to him 'do you fight?'. Because with this energy and aggression they are quarelsome. It says in the book quarrelsome.

213
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:27,559
They go into a fight immediately, they quarrel.

214
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:36,999
'Do you quarrel sometimes?'. 'Sometimes? I will just give you an example. I work here and somebody

215
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:47,889
said something that irritated me, in the other side. So I did not have time to go through the corridors and I jumped

216
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:53,409
over the desks of the different people and I grabbed him there.

217
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:09,200
So fast and so irritable!

218
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:21,699
 If you have a Tarent. case on a video, the energy which is emitted from such case is tremendous!

219
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:28,719
The whole class is recharged with the energy of the patient. It is fantastic, the way they talk.

220
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:50,969
 There are of course manic depressive cases that will need Tarent. M.S. cases they need Tarent. and cases of alcoholism.

221
00:45:54,040 --> 00:46:14,479
I remember a case, an alcoholic, and I touched his arms and I felt underneath all the nervous system was going like that.

222
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:30,539
He was in the last stage, he would see nightmares, just open his eyes. It was terrible state and he was going like that .

223
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:38,819
I prescribed Tarent. for him. He stopped drinking for a period of time, then he relapsed, he went back

224
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:47,039
and he didn't come back to us but his wife told us that for a few months he stopped.

225
00:46:49,960 --> 00:47:02,739
Excess energy which is expanded in dancing, desire to dance, desire strong music etc. can be self-destructive also.

226
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:25,609
They will hit themselves on the wall, they will tear their clothes, mental cases. The energy in mental cases where we have

227
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:35,529
this excess energy exploding suddenly in severe mentally ill people, these are cases of Tarent.

228
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:38,200
M.S. yes.

229
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:49,259
 Because of the nervous system. Once there is this hyperactivity of the person and you have the idea of Tarent.,

230
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:56,279
whatever it might be the neuro muscular disease, the nervous system is affected.

231
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:03,979
The nervous system not that they have specific symptom, they have to have this type of person.

232
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:18,639
They eat very fast, they talk fast and also symptoms will appear suddenly and they will go away also suddenly.

233
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:22,569
Headache will appear suddenly and it will go out suddenly.

234
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:39,569
-How do you differentiate Nux -v. from Tarent.? Because it is also in a hurry, explosive, tears things apart.

235
00:48:46,400 --> 00:49:03,479
- Nux-v. will never have this hurriedness feeling, that's first. Also Nux -v. will not like this strong noise from music.

236
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:18,219
 They cannot tolerate it. Nux-v. will not be so much extroverted. Tarent. is totally extroverted.

237
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:25,859
Nux-v. will keep inside, that's why they suffer with their stomach. The aggression and the anger is kept inside.

238
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:33,560
 With Tarent. is not possible to keep it inside.

239
00:49:33,561 --> 00:49:51,439
And of course in the sexual sphere you will have all this excess energy, this extrovert person.

240
00:49:53,680 --> 00:50:08,759
They are almost in a state of mania constantly, the sexual energy is very strong and therefore they become very promiscuous.

241
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:16,510
They have to have sex. Suddenly the hormones come, we have to have sex.

242
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:26,999
 What they can do is unbelievable.

243
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:41,829
I remember a mental case in France. They called me to treat. It was a girl of a very aristocratic family and she was crazy.

244
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:52,030
When I asked the mother about that area, sex, she said...

245
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:13,639
...'I can't believe it. Sometimes when she needs to have sex she will go out in the street and pick a man'.

246
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:27,440
It is not possible to control at all. Like the anger which cannot be controlled.

247
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:40,159
When the anger comes, the adrenaline is in the blood, then they have to expand it by violent act.

248
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:58,649
Tarentulas are people, they are in a hurry. They leave the car and they have to go upstairs. They will always run.

249
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:16,380
They will not walk properly. 2-3 steps each time, no reason. He has arrived home, he has to relax, it doesn't matter.

250
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:33,699
-I have one question concerning the remedy in the last line of the mental symptoms, it says extreme violence and desire to kill.

251
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:43,279
Does this violence mean physical violence injuring people or is it meant in a sense of intensity?

252
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:53,520
-Extreme violence and desire to kill is the peak of the anger.

253
00:52:53,521 --> 00:53:02,589
It can reach such peak the anger that they want to do violence. They are not controlled.

254
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:16,579
You see we don't do violence, even if we are very mad, there is no violence for a person who is normal.

255
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:28,079
These people they can kill of course. If the Tarent. pathology is established and it is there for years, they are the people

256
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:33,089
who will take the gun and do violence.

257
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:44,159
It's very strange you hear it in the news, the newspapers. They say, suddenly this man, he was nice

258
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,140
he grabs somebody and kills him and shoots him.

259
00:53:51,120 --> 00:54:01,099
 All these are pathological cases. Stram., Tarent., Hyos.

260
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:10,579
If you have given the remedy before, I believe they would never committed these crimes.

261
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:28,579
It's a great pity that Homeopathy is kept so much to the background and it's not widely accepted and spread and practiced.

262
00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:37,329
But time is coming, it will happen. Never mind the resistance.

263
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:51,430
The Russians were the revolutionists.

264
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:02,289
 Eventually they developed a philosophy which was expressed with a proverb.

265
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:11,079
Somebody from the communists who have been to Russia, told me this story in Russia,  she says,

266
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:24,799
 we say that a young man who does not fight the establishment, does not have heart, he is heartless.

267
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:39,340
And old men who fight the establishment do not have brains.

268
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:55,369
If you become old and you still fight the establishment, no brains. But a young man has to fight the establishment.

269
00:55:56,360 --> 00:56:00,100
So it seems I have no brains.

270
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:12,650
According to this philosophy, I have no brains, finished.

271
00:56:15,312 --> 00:56:29,899
-You are not Russian.
-I'm not Russian but I have found out it's very wise.

272
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:39,119
Because you get tired, you fight, you fight and you hit here, you hit there.

273
00:56:40,890 --> 00:56:51,959
Then you say, I give up. I go with the establishment.

274
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:06,840
You need some stupid people also in this world.

275
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:19,310
Desire for sand. Tarent. children are taking sand and eat it.

276
00:57:19,311 --> 00:57:35,799
Also there is another element in the face of Tarent. which is this cunning look.

277
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:54,240
I have to show you sometime on a case, to show you what I mean. There is a cunningness, there is

278
00:57:54,241 --> 00:58:05,219
something which is playful and at the same time foxy.

279
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:36,559
But definitely in order to give Tarent. you have to have this excess energy which is ameliorated by rhythmic motion or strong music.

280
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:49,639
You see especially the Germans who like music it's not they are Tarentulas because everyone likes music, it's different.

281
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:55,960
With Tarent. the music has to be very strong and very rhythmic.

282
00:58:56,440 --> 00:59:02,139
 The rock music, this rythmic music which is played very fast.

283
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:13,599
A person who is cultivated in understanding music, they don't like this type of music.

284
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:26,289
It's very interesting they say in old times when somebody was bitten by Tarent., the cure was to call the band of the village

285
00:59:26,290 --> 00:59:35,269
and play rhythmically while the person was lying down with convulsions and vomiting and spitting.

286
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:44,680
-I had one Tarent. case which I treated.

287
00:59:51,720 --> 01:00:02,839
 He had tumor of the testes, it was not painful,
 I knew this young man  he was 30 years at that time.

288
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:12,619
For an entire night he told me his thoughts, what he is thinking and how sex appeals to him.

289
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:25,569
He had not only the desire to dance too extreme with loud music but from time to time he had to paint.

290
01:00:29,090 --> 01:00:40,099
Large pictures. Besides that everything had to be extreme in his life, not only music and the large paintings but also travelling.

291
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:50,300
To make it short, this young man had an operation and received chemotherapy...

292
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:56,850
...he already had metastasis...

293
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:06,790
...and after that he received Tarent. and after that he fathered a child.

294
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:17,359
Eventhough before they had told him he would not be able to have children.

295
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:24,920
Today he does not have this violence anymore...

296
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:39,430
...but he did not return for treatment. 3 years ago.

297
01:01:45,400 --> 01:02:02,299
-That's typical case. All this energy goes to the sexual sphere primarily with all these kind of perversions

298
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:10,939
 promiscuity, they want to do all kinds of sex, double sex, triple sex, whatever you call it.

299
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:39,759
- I have two questions. Do we know why people get into Tarent. state, like in Asar. we said they press themselves?

300
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:48,719
The second is how do I, in a 4 old child having problems, differentiate Iod. from Tarent.?

301
01:02:48,720 --> 01:03:10,689
-Restlessness in little children and aggressive. Fighting, attacking very easily, the restlessness will be prominent while

302
01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:14,470
the fear of dark will not be there.

303
01:03:19,950 --> 01:03:32,330
Between Iod? Iod. is not violent.  It will not show such violence. It will show restlessness and heat in the body.

304
01:03:33,330 --> 01:03:41,370
The Tarent. is a warm remedy but not a very warm remedy. Iod. is very warm remedy.

305
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:56,280
- I wanted to add that the mother is also Tarent.

306
01:03:56,281 --> 01:04:05,440
She was never treated. She developed breast cancer at the same time.

307
01:04:15,210 --> 01:04:24,490
Would it be possible that very deep psychological disturbances which were present during the pregnancy, could be the cause?

308
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:37,719
-When we are talking about a constitutional like this, what we described here, the pure type, what we call the constitutional types,

309
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:46,909
these types they don't have to be produced by a certain stress.

310
01:04:48,530 --> 01:05:01,759
Such patients can be from birth and stay on the Tarent. level for the rest of their lives.

311
01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:16,239
Also Tarent. is because of the strength of the organism, these are strong organisms, they are doing very well

312
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:23,899
in whatever problem they may have.

313
01:05:25,930 --> 01:05:33,399
It is also very strange, you know I brought the idea of not coffee, don't drink coffee because I found out that coffee

314
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:43,759
antidotes the homeopathic treatment. I had a Tarent. case and I told him also don't drink coffee.

315
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:58,479
He came with a relapse 9 months to 1 year later, if I remember well, and I asked him why?

316
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:06,889
He said, 'I had been drinking coffee constantly, I did not pay attention to what you said' but it lasted for 9 months

317
01:06:06,890 --> 01:06:17,870
 before he relapsed. Another case at the most one month, drinking coffee every day will relapse.

318
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:24,359
 He lasted 9 months drinking coffee.

319
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:27,760
The organisms are very very strong.
