1
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:41,200
This is the evolution from the presentation we had in Thessaloniki with the presence of about 15-20 authorities

2
00:00:41,201 --> 00:00:51,829
of Medicine and general directors of clinics and professors of different specialties.

3
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:56,310
The professors of Internal Medicine were not there.

4
00:00:56,311 --> 00:01:09,839
This is characteristic. They would like to stay with their prejudices. All of them they said, we were prejudiced

5
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:22,190
from what we could hear and these prejudices come actually from all the kinds of nonsense which is going on

6
00:01:22,191 --> 00:01:27,399
with Homeopathy all over the world.

7
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:39,640
And some of this is imported in Greece. In Greece we don't have so much meditating around the tomato.

8
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:57,390
Or meditating on the wall. Giving it to those who want to divorce.

9
00:01:57,391 --> 00:02:08,910
This kind of nonsense is heard and it circulates very fast making a lot of damage because the people who would

10
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:16,799
like to do damage, they hear only that. And they remember only that and when there is a discussion

11
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:25,339
 they give out all the bad information. So we have to fight this kind of nonsense.

12
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:33,550
Anybody can do whatever he likes privately. When somebody comes publically and states such nonsense

13
00:02:33,551 --> 00:02:40,359
 he has to be criticized very strongly by everybody.

14
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:48,459
It's not only me that I have to do all the dirty work. It's everybody's responsibility to protect.

15
00:02:48,460 --> 00:03:03,949
He says, we potentize a song, we potentize a song and they will give it to the people. This is absolutely crazy ideas.

16
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:22,200
An agent that can cause problem, can treat this problem but the first condition is that it can cause problems.

17
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:43,200
These are things which make me mad. Because these things they circulate not for the reason of improving the science

18
00:03:43,201 --> 00:03:52,199
but for the reason of impressing some naive people, we have a special word in Greek, but it's not use to repeat it now.

19
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:03,679
It means vegetables, impressing vegetables, people who do not think.

20
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,260
And impressing for his or her own good.

21
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:29,999
Frederick was telling me, he was in a seminar and they were talking about the salivation of owl.

22
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:49,400
We potentize this, maybe the spirit is here!

23
00:04:52,300 --> 00:05:01,879
 I don't want to go into that because then everything goes into recording and it's not nice even to repeat these things.

24
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:07,579
But unfortunately they are going all along.

25
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:31,319
What I would like to do today is, as I promised you, to do a differential diagnosis of the remedies which have strong jealousy.

26
00:05:50,760 --> 00:06:04,150
First of all what I want to say before we go into differential diagnosis is that this feeling of jealousy

27
00:06:04,151 --> 00:06:10,719
is one of the natural feelings that everybody has.

28
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:34,129
It is not pathology as long as it does not go over the limits; that means it does not occupy and overwhelms the individual.

29
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:49,040
When you are in love with somebody and you don't have jealousy, be sure you are not in love.

30
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:53,839
That means you do not desire this 'object'.

31
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:08,719
There is no desire and therefore there is no jealousy and then you can be proud 'I am not jealous!'.

32
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:29,920
Well if you were never jealous, that means you did not have that feeling of desire for somebody which is...

33
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:55,320
...one of the reasons, I was telling on the first lessons, that your cells and your living cells become into

34
00:07:55,321 --> 00:08:06,729
a state of quietness and a state of unification. That they have a possibility to unite with each other.

35
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:19,789
 If you have two individualities they cannot unite, they clash. You have to disappear this to unite.

36
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:30,050
In a magical way this disappearance comes and then one merges into the other. This is the idea of creation...

37
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:40,969
...between the limitations in which we are living.

38
00:08:41,660 --> 00:09:01,179
We cannot create, we cannot bring a new idea unless we lose our individuality, our ego. I'm going to bring an idea.

39
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:08,920
You will never going to bring an idea. If you are in that state where you feel I am going to bring a new idea to the world

40
00:09:08,921 --> 00:09:17,199
 you are not going to bring a new idea. This is for sure, why? Because you don't allow this merge between

41
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:25,969
yourself and the world of ideas, God, whatever.

42
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:57,110
Actually the people who deal with bees, if they are bitten by the bees they become more and more healthy.

43
00:09:57,111 --> 00:09:59,569
It's very strange.

44
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:05,560
They are healthy and they like to be bitten by the bees.

45
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:19,769
I mean there is a little pain but on the long run it seems that the organism by mobilizing its defenses

46
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:30,479
in order to counteract something on the surface, it acts like a homeopathic remedy. It is true.

47
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:46,989
Unless of course in the case you are allergic and you may have an allergic shock of course which is totally different story.

48
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:55,400
That means there is a limitation, there is something lacking in your defenses and then it may come to this

49
00:10:55,401 --> 00:10:58,759
direction and then they have the shock.

50
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:06,620
-I had a patient, he was a bees farmer and he came into the clinic and I asked him if he had some stitches

51
00:11:06,621 --> 00:11:14,199
or anything or if he had tonsillitis and he told me that just yesterday he had 15 bees stings, there was nothing

52
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:20,889
to be seen all around his face. So it completely disappeared and he told me that all the bees farmers are like that.

53
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:26,649
So whenever they get bitten, nothing happens anymore.

54
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:45,249
-They get an immunity, the body knows, that's no problem, don't worry.

55
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,599
So we go back to the idea of jealousy.

56
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:26,619
Jealousy is because we are not complete individuals. We yearn to be complete by the mergings of the other side.

57
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:45,720
That is why there is a satisfaction in case there is real love, when there is the climax of love which is the sexual act

58
00:12:45,721 --> 00:12:55,159
and there is orgasm. Then this feeling of completeness comes from the idea that you lost yourself.

59
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:01,749
 You lost your ego, you are ready to merge with somebody else.

60
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:13,829
Otherwise when you have sex with somebody for the first time, you meet somebody, then you go out and have sex, be careful.

61
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:24,319
Not only that but you have a feeling of incompleteness if you do that.

62
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,070
This is not a good state.

63
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:46,449
You have done whatever you are doing. What I say is, the idea is when you advise your patients.

64
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:57,369
When the young people come and they are eager, I am 18 and I never had a friend, I never had sex.

65
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:05,839
In America this is a crime. If you are 18 and you don't go out?

66
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:12,730
This is craziness.

67
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:29,749
There is a time for a maturity and time for this magical moment in which conception comes and people are born

68
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:37,839
 which are complete, not missing a hand, one finger or one feeling.

69
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:49,850
People are born but they will be missing parts, they will be missing a part not only on the body, the teratogenesis

70
00:14:49,851 --> 00:15:01,029
is not only on physical, it's on mental and emotional, we have monsters.

71
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:12,440
Born monsters, born killer. He is born monster why? Because the parents who came together they produced

72
00:15:12,441 --> 00:15:21,659
 that child who is missing the feeling of sympathy. Who is missing an organ!

73
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:31,580
You cannot see that his eyes are blocked, where you see it in the physical body but actually he is missing a part

74
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:35,889
an organ or even a system.

75
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:45,780
That's why you see these little boys, can you imagine they take a gun and they come to the class and they kill everybody?

76
00:15:45,781 --> 00:15:56,150
Something is missing. It is a part in them, in the emotional which is not functioning at all.

77
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:15,079
In the same way when this is missing, the other side takes over.

78
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:48,610
What I want to say is that in case of jealousy for instance, something is missing for those individuals

79
00:16:48,611 --> 00:16:57,269
who show jealousy in such a degree as to become pathological.

80
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:12,209
What is missing? Then we look Hyos. and Lach., they are the prime remedies for jealousy.

81
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:19,140
And Nux-v. has been elevated I think.

82
00:17:19,241 --> 00:17:40,839
Apis, Calc-s., Cench., Hyos., Ign. Ign. has to be raised, I will explain the jealousy of Ign.

83
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:59,969
Lach., Lyc., Med. yes it's correctly there, Nux-m, I don't know who put that. Nux-v. yes, Puls., Staph., Stram. correctly.

84
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:13,279
There are additions but they are correct. We have to differentiate between these remedies.

85
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:23,519
Gall-ac. also is a remedy for children. We'll speak about it.

86
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:40,950
For instance if you go through these remedies and you will see what is missing and why a part is missing

87
00:18:40,951 --> 00:18:44,429
and another part becomes very strong.

88
00:18:45,480 --> 00:19:00,430
Like the way when you miss your two hands, the legs attain more qualities and you can paint with your leg

89
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:03,239
and you can do a lot of things.

90
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:11,800
Other organs come to replace that which is missing.

91
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:32,449
In the same way, this is how this pathology is produced and if we want to go fast into what is missing in each remedy

92
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:50,350
I will tell you quickly. Apis, what is missing. Is...

93
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:17,190
somebody who jumps into the feelings. And stings in case she is threatened. She is missing quietness...

94
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:35,880
... is missing the element of self assurance and quietness. In Apis we can say impulsive jealousy.

95
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,809
Hyos., what is missing?

96
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:53,960
It's missing a feeling of sympathy and understanding.

97
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:09,429
At the same time the negative energy which is there, is coming out as a destructive force.

98
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:41,329
I will go back to say the complete picture. This is a new thought, I'm just developing now.

99
00:21:50,290 --> 00:22:04,809
It just comes as I talk, it's not something which I have meditated upon specifically.

100
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:32,059
Lach. is the passion too much, the passion of possession is extreme where Hyos. is detached, Lach. is attached.

101
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:37,819
That' s why their jealousy is of a totally different type.

102
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:53,970
The jealousy comes from different aspects, not only from the partner whom you are in love.

103
00:22:53,971 --> 00:23:01,009
 It comes from everything which can cause jealousy. The other one is better than me.

104
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:07,279
 like in Nux-v. In Nux-v. they want to be the best and they want to the first.

105
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:16,220
They are lacking this modesty.

106
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:33,969
The Med. is controlled by his sexual desires and passion.

107
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:54,619
The jealousy of Med. is for the partner because they feel the moment they desire somebody, all the energy is there

108
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:58,710
 nothing else matters.

109
00:23:58,711 --> 00:24:13,820
But of course in two months they can change the object of their desire. That's why they can have several

110
00:24:13,821 --> 00:24:24,329
affairs within a short period of time and being quite passionate in all of them.

111
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:47,199
That means the hormonal imbalance is too much and that's why they become very egotistical in their love affairs.

112
00:24:49,040 --> 00:25:01,440
If you go to the rubric egotism, you will see Med. is there. Egotism is why mostly in this specific partnership

113
00:25:06,147 --> 00:25:13,359
between man and woman they like to be the masters of the game.

114
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:19,280
The jealousy of Stram., you can imagine.

115
00:25:19,281 --> 00:25:37,079
 Always comes with rage, uncontrollable rage, they are the people who hit, Hyos. and Stram. they will hit the partner.

116
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:49,559
Med. will not do it although the jealousy is very strong. Lach. will not do it.

117
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:59,909
But Hyos., Stram. and Nux-v. they will do violence during jealousy.

118
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:18,550
The jealousy of Hyos. is not only for the partner. It is jealousy between brother and sister.

119
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:31,239
Very strong jealousy which is not expressed openly.

120
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:41,359
Hyos. may be very jealous and you as a parent you have not understood it.

121
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:53,279
Because it is a remedy that cools down, that some of the human feelings are gone in Hyos.

122
00:26:53,280 --> 00:27:04,180
You don't have these human feelings that if I hit you, you feel pain. So this will hold back.

123
00:27:04,181 --> 00:27:09,709
 They don't understand these feelings.

124
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:20,719
There is a coolness. It says this person is hard, it's not only hard, it's hard and detached.

125
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:38,439
When you will take the case of Hyos. you will see that while there is a lot of anger deep down, nothing is expressed overtly.

126
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:56,679
They will not come out and shout, fight verbally but when the time comes, they can kill in a very cool way.

127
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:08,849
Many times I have said this example. I was taking a case of Hyos. epilepsy and the woman was describing

128
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:20,979
how she killed her brother, when she was 6 and her brother was 3.

129
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:35,039
I asked about jealousy and she said yes but I never show it but what I did to my brother.

130
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:48,569
My brother was sitting in front of the swimming pool, he was 3 and I just passed and I just pushed him

131
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:51,879
and continued to walk.

132
00:28:55,010 --> 00:29:07,209
And she looks there very cool she says and then I thought in the end, that's the end, then I called my mother.

133
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:15,360
Then she shouted to her mother that the brother was in the swimming pool. He fell into the swimming pool.

134
00:29:15,361 --> 00:29:19,649
She said, I never said this to my mother of course because she will kill me.

135
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:29,230
This is an example of the coolness and the detachment of Hyos.

136
00:29:29,231 --> 00:29:38,149
Hyos. will not make a scene, it has the jealousy but will not show it.

137
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:56,389
Constantly swallows what they feel is a betrayal of the other partner, they swallow it, they don't talk.

138
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:03,200
Even when there is something done overtly.

139
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:17,280
 The people play games with each other, especially in these matters in order to create a kind of interest

140
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:34,169
one for the other. And one of the games is that if I flirt with somebody, my husband or boyfriend will get mad and they like it.

141
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:44,579
You try this with Hyos. to get a reaction, forget it. She will pretend she does not know.

142
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:52,879
In the meantime there is all the anger going deep down and disappears.

143
00:30:54,140 --> 00:31:13,169
But then you do it several times.Then the idea of Hyos. is to kill you, I will kill you one day. I will cut your genitals.

144
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:22,039
It's something of that type. This is the Hyos. jealousy. This is the typical Hyos. jealousy.

145
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:40,089
It's not a jealousy that will make a scene. On the contrary with Apis is an impulsive. Apis is somebody who is awkward.

146
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:57,939
In the same way it's awkward in their relationship, in their contact with the other people.

147
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,209
They are awkward.

148
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:11,360
They will say things, they do things and they are not aware of their awkwardness.

149
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:28,369
Where does this awkwardness comes from? It comes from a state of feelings which are over flowing.

150
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:47,349
The feeling of - in the table- I want to take some bread. The bread is there and in front of the bread, there is a glass of water.

151
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:57,679
They don't see how they get the bread, they just push the water down to get the bread. This is the idea of awkwardness.

152
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:08,600
But this is Apis, what kind of awkward feelings they have inside.

153
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:26,819
They throw chairs down, they walk in the street and in a very straight and suddenly you see them down.

154
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:41,119
Just a little bit of objects that they hit and they are down. They have no balance; in the same way they behave

155
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:49,239
 in their erotic life. They want something, get it quickly.

156
00:33:50,720 --> 00:34:02,229
And this idea is with the jealousy also. When they come to the point, they explode.

157
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,590
And they will try to go away.

158
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:19,840
They will shout and then they leave. They say, 'I leave you, I cannot be with you'. 'No, I was wrong'.

159
00:34:19,841 --> 00:34:27,439
Then they come back again and again until they leave and then from Apis they go to Nat-m.

160
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:36,639
That's how they become Nat-m. They close themselves. Then you have to give first Nat-m. and then Apis.

161
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:40,179
These two remedies are complementary.

162
00:34:46,440 --> 00:35:00,749
Nat-m is in a low degree, why? Because the Nat-m. have closed themselves already and they don't allow

163
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:13,760
 scenes of jealousy. You do not see jealousy of Nat-m. because there is dignity. They feel their dignity is threatened

164
00:35:13,761 --> 00:35:21,929
if they come out and say a word and show their weaknesses.

165
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:37,159
In Nat-m. the idea of dignity is very strong and very well established and if they do anything which loses

166
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:47,619
their dignity, if other people feel they are ridiculous, this is tremendous for Nat-m.

167
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:57,969
If I was a Nat-m. I would not be able to perform anything because the idea of ridiculous, I would be self-conscious all the time.

168
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:09,119
In a Nat-m. state I may be spelling the same ideas but in a totally different way, not expressing them.

169
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:19,120
So Nat-m. is jealous but with dignity.

170
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:38,079
Dignity is important, 'I cannot let myself go into the state of fight, quarrel and let anybody see what I feel inside'.

171
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:47,239
Because I may look ridiculous or I may lose my dignity. This is the idea.

172
00:36:47,240 --> 00:37:00,090
That's why when you take a case you have to understand when this is a problem. Where this lies?

173
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:05,159
In the area of Stram.?

174
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:18,350
I had a case, I said 'there was any of these girlfriends whom you did not hit?'

175
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:24,659
He tried to remember.

176
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:37,419
He had a lot of women, he was 40 years old, good looking. He said no. I said OK take Hyos.

177
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:51,499
He said, 'but I never show my jealousy because if I show my jealousy, then the other woman gets detached from me.

178
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:55,639
And that was the time when I hit them'.

179
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:16,079
Also he would hit them for different reasons. He would find another reason and hit them, Hyos. Not to show the jealousy.

180
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:32,000
If you open the Repertory, it says 'desires to kill'. The desire to kill is very strong with Hyos., all the time thinks

181
00:38:32,001 --> 00:38:39,569
 I would like to kill. I just go out and kill.

182
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:51,020
Such individuals who have been born in their DNA's with these kind of problems are born from parents

183
00:38:51,021 --> 00:39:02,924
 who were not having sexual intercourse at the right time with the right person.

184
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:14,739
They could not lose themselves into the process and the creation was a monster.

185
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:29,639
I am good, no you are not good. Nobody is good, nobody is really, totally complete.

186
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:59,249
So you have to be careful and you have to advice accordingly your patients. Love and let it go.

187
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:14,559
They will say, some people, the Nat-m's, the Ign's, the Sepias, cannot let it go.

188
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:26,149
This 'I cannot let it go' is a hold back of the soul.

189
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:49,719
When you fall in love, the part which takes from you is the soul, the feelings. The mind is sleeping.

190
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:59,550
And many times you say, when I fell in love I was so stupid because I thought he was a god.

191
00:40:59,551 --> 00:41:08,760
 I thought this man was a perfect man and I was so stupid. The mind does not take part in this process.

192
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:25,879
 It's only the feelings, so therefore when a sexual act takes place...

193
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:36,329
Please comments. Just listen first and when you understand, then you pass comments.

194
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:52,159
Either about yourselves or others, do not think by the time I'm talking.

195
00:41:52,160 --> 00:42:02,809
I can perceive what you are thinking and why and it disturbs my process of thinking.

196
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:15,320
I cannot complete the subject.

197
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:22,799
You don't believe me. This is not something special which I have.

198
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:30,360
Everyone understands the thoughts and the feelings of everybody else. The difference perhaps is that

199
00:42:30,361 --> 00:42:37,499
you don't pay attention and I pay more attention to what I feel, what I see.

200
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:49,019
It's not that you don't see. You don't want to see. If you say, I don't feel it is because you don't want.

201
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:57,760
The human is born with 6th sense, what we call intuition.

202
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:08,719
The ancients used this feeling together with thinking in a merging and that's why they discovered

203
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:20,120
such beautiful places. You go to the places that they have built, these nice temples and you say, what a view

204
00:43:20,121 --> 00:43:29,783
 how fantastic. Also the monasteries. You go to some monasteries and you say, how did they choose this place?

205
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:37,359
It was through the 6th sense. They were left there and they said, 'God guide me' or something like

206
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:48,279
that and then they felt the atmosphere. They allowed themselves to merge and to perceive.

207
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:55,529
And when you go there, you say 'oh my God, this is fantastic'.

208
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:18,940
So when the sexual act takes place in a case, they participate only the soul, the feelings and the body.

209
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,819
Not the mind. Forget it.

210
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:35,129
The moment your mind interferes, forget the pleasure. What the hell I'm doing now?

211
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:41,269
You are observing yourself doing this, doing whatever you have to do.

212
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:53,219
You are not lost in the process, you just observe the process and of course there is no joy. The joy comes when?

213
00:44:53,220 --> 00:45:01,519
The joy and the calmness comes in the time you lose yourself in the process.

214
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:14,039
Lose yourself means you don't see yourself at all. You are passionate, you are merging with the other person.

215
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:37,399
Hyos. can do that? No they  cannot. Why? Because something is missing in their feelings, a part is missing.

216
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:53,889
It's an organ on the soul which is missing. That' s why they cannot do it and they are born with this deficiency.

217
00:45:53,890 --> 00:46:02,319
In the same way you are missing an eye or a finger or a leg.

218
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:17,809
Monsters, these are the monsters. The children they are Stram. and Hyos. who take the guns and kill their schoolmates.

219
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:29,129
And where you see more and more of these atrocities? This kind of behavior? In America.

220
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:44,050
Because in America the technology, the technological civilization has interfered so much as to make

221
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:47,359
robots out of humans.

222
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:58,850
When I see somebody giving lectures in America, first of all they speak very fast, they know what they have to do

223
00:46:58,851 --> 00:47:02,359
and they say it in the same tone of voice.

224
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:13,040
In the end you look and you don't know whether a human being is talking with some kind of emotions

225
00:47:13,041 --> 00:47:21,122
no emotions at all, the head separated from the feelings totally. And the head is talking.

226
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:41,159
This is pathology and this belongs to Nat-m., to all the closed remedies, to Kali's, to Ph-ac.

227
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:52,310
What is this? You don't have feelings? What are you saying? And therefore you can say any lie you like, in this way.

228
00:47:52,311 --> 00:48:01,319
Because nobody will understand what you say is a lie or it is true.

229
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:12,560
You can tell any lie you like, you don't blush. You try to say a lie yourself, that you are not used to saying a lie

230
00:48:12,561 --> 00:48:15,599
and you see immediately in front of others, you blush.

231
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:20,200
Somebody who will observe, immediately.

232
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:38,400
 It's so easy to get somebody and then these people they have their conscience still intact which is controlling

233
00:48:38,401 --> 00:48:44,320
what are you saying, it's a lie. You blush.

234
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:57,560
And this is complete. You have this organ inside which controls. If you take out this organ or you make this organ

235
00:48:57,561 --> 00:49:10,369
of conscience, you make it blunt and then you start immediately going different directions, different deviations.

236
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:37,249
All this is connected together and as people of the West we are most responsible for the whole of the planet.

237
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:52,559
Because we are the examples and poor Africans, poor South Americans, poor Asians are trying to imitate the American culture.

238
00:49:55,320 --> 00:50:05,690
Nobody is exempt. What is happening in America? If you analyze, it is a deep sickness in the population.

239
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:16,399
 Which is spreading over Europe, quite a lot, first Northern Europe and then it comes down to us very fast.

240
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:30,290
To the South. We have more feelings resisting and then we can resist. We say, I don't like this.

241
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:37,839
You have one time sex in this manner, you didn't like it, your feelings are strong, you cannot do it again.

242
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:44,520
Forget it, I don't like it, I will not do it again because the feelings are strong. But if the feelings are not strong

243
00:50:44,521 --> 00:50:50,889
 then you cannot resist. You say, there was some kind of pleasure, let me repeat it.

244
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:57,659
If you do like this, you end up in deviations.

245
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:08,839
In comparison with Hyos. jealousy, let's see the Lach. jealousy.

246
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:17,200
The Lach. jealousy is exactly the opposite.

247
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:26,479
 Every time they feel jealous, they have to express it, they have to say it.

248
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:38,510
They cannot keep it inside because first of all the feelings are strong, the passion and the desire for the other person is strong

249
00:51:38,511 --> 00:51:47,489
and therefore the idea of losing the object of their desire is unbearable.

250
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:54,810
Yet they will not think of killing the other person.

251
00:51:57,220 --> 00:52:07,539
But the feelings of jealousy are one of the primary pathology of Lach.

252
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:20,049
We say, does Lach. get fears? No, it doesn't get fears, it gets jealousy as pathology and it might get depression also.

253
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:28,960
But there are certain areas in which they are sensitive and the area of pathology of Lach., in psychological state

254
00:52:28,961 --> 00:52:37,499
 is jealousy which is overwhelming and totally out of control.

255
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:42,240
That means it's going to be expressed.

256
00:52:55,180 --> 00:53:06,569
A Lach. neither will leave the partner
nor the partner will leave the Lach.

257
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:16,090
Not easily at least, why?

258
00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:33,109
Because the one who can bear the jealousies of Lach., which they come every day, they feel secure.

259
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:38,360
Lach. will not go with another man.

260
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:52,819
 She cannot cheat. Hyos. can cheat; while they have an affair, they can have another affair.

261
00:53:52,820 --> 00:54:03,280
Nat-m. can cheat, why? Out of self-defense.

262
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:10,549
 They feel they have to have another support before the other person is leaving them.

263
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:22,760
Let me develop another companionship or friendship in order to suffer less when my partner will leave me.

264
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:34,020
Lach. don't care about that. They just want that person, they are totally focused on that person and the jealousy

265
00:54:34,021 --> 00:54:37,749
comes with the least provocation.

266
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:55,569
In a party you go with your wife and I'm Lach. and my wife greets somebody.

267
00:54:57,830 --> 00:55:08,840
Can you imagine Lach., oh he is such a good looking man, all the Lach. attention is on these hands.

268
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:20,440
You get it one split of a second more.
And they feel it. What they feel?

269
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:29,140
The passion of Lach. which has been expressed during the sexual act, which I know it is so strong

270
00:55:29,141 --> 00:55:40,559
is going now to be repeated with this handshake or what is going to follow after the handshake.

271
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:55,470
Even if it's a split of a second, they will say, 'do you like this person?'. 'Nice'.

272
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:08,359
And then they go to the party and sometimes you look at him or her or her and sometimes you look at the person also.

273
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:21,799
There is a big feeling around, he is looking now and that's it they have an affair.

274
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:31,720
How is it, we were together all this time. Yes but you went to the toilet.

275
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:42,809
This kind of jealousy, it's the pathological jealousy of Lach.

276
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:52,579
Because there is passion, there is attachment. With Lach. the attachment is a big thing.

277
00:56:52,580 --> 00:57:08,200
They are very passionate, very attached, enjoying very much the sexual act but if you cannot stand these

278
00:57:08,201 --> 00:57:13,359
jealousy scenes, they are too much.

279
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:26,859
They telephone you in the office and Mr. John is out. Immediately, you have gone to meet your girlfriend.

280
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:33,770
No, I went to buy a sandwich.
Forget it. Sandwich?

281
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:43,519
Why don't you ask me to prepare for you a sandwich? Why do you have to go out and get a sandwich?

282
00:57:47,600 --> 00:58:01,550
They talk, how much and how fast.
They say Lach. does not spell out words.

283
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:15,539
Because the feelings don't wait to articulate and to be expressed.

284
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:24,780
That is why you get the expression of Kent.

285
00:58:24,781 --> 00:58:33,599
He has a description of Lach. while talking. He describes exactly what I'm showing you now.

286
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:47,119
Another remedy which is jealous is Nux-v.

287
00:58:52,810 --> 00:58:59,110
Nux-v. is the big cheater.

288
00:59:02,310 --> 00:59:08,960
That means is a person who needs stimulation.

289
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:21,999
3 months, 4,5 months and the stimulation is gone, so he will be searching for another stimulation.

290
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:34,260
Like the idea with coffee, with stimulants, all kinds of stimulants. They take drugs, they cannot resist.

291
00:59:34,261 --> 00:59:37,719
They need that stimulation.

292
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:48,110
Therefore they are the big cheaters. When you cheat many times you cheat with another person who is married

293
00:59:48,111 --> 00:59:54,039
and that is not a proper thing to do, right?

294
00:59:54,040 --> 01:00:05,029
Nux-v. has no problems with all that. The idea of stimulation, this idea stimulates him even better, why?

295
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:08,530
Because it is outlaw.

296
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:22,649
So the stimulation is even stronger. She is married, she is good looking and then he tries to flirt with another woman.

297
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:34,489
Now once they get this woman or they get this partnership, they become very jealous.

298
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:44,559
By projecting their own life into the life of the other person, they believe the others are behaving the same way.

299
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:50,640
And that's why the jealousy arises very
 easily and they are very suspicious.

300
01:00:51,380 --> 01:01:01,519
They will not say anything because they know the game of cheating very well.

301
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:21,120
I remember one patient was telling, he says 'I have devised all kinds of lies to cover up my cheating

302
01:01:21,121 --> 01:01:27,759
which my wife for the last 20 years, she believes'.

303
01:01:30,490 --> 01:01:39,700
And the idea was that as soon as he had a new affair, he was jealous that the other person will cheat

304
01:01:39,701 --> 01:01:42,319
 in the same way like they do.

305
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:58,070
And immediately they know the signs, they imagine that is a sign. And once they imagine it, they become

306
01:01:58,071 --> 01:02:03,319
very jealous and they can become also very violent.

307
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:16,999
And once they are violent, they can strike, they can hit, not to kill but to show that they are the masters.

308
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:28,839
In the same way that Nux-v. wants to be the best and the first, in the same way in the partnership this feeling predominates.

309
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:37,079
I am better, I am the master and you have to be subordinate, you have to obey.

310
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:45,439
And once they obey, of course they leave them because there is no stimulation for them anymore.

311
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:54,670
You see how different these remedies are. It says jealousy, it is not jealousy only, it is the whole context

312
01:02:54,671 --> 01:02:58,529
under which you put the jealousy.

313
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:12,759
And one very interesting remedy which is misunderstood or has not been talked about in jealousy, for instance is Ign..

314
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:24,119
Ign. can be paranoid in jealousy.

315
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,879
Maybe I have become Caust. or something.

316
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:24,799
What is the characteristic of jealousy of Ign.? You cannot imagine. The very characteristic is periodicity.

317
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:37,480
Jealousy in periodical periods, not constant.

318
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:54,069
 There is a kind of stimulation, some things are observed which Ign. feels that this might be a sign.

319
01:04:54,070 --> 01:05:01,919
From that moment onward they become the most tormenting partners you can ever imagine.

320
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:05,679
They will ask questions.

321
01:05:07,450 --> 01:05:23,789
'And the person whom you met on the party, this was your ex-friend?'. 'Yes but now I feel nothing for him'.

322
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:29,100
'What have you done? And they pressure, and they pressure.

323
01:05:29,101 --> 01:05:42,860
 So much anxiety and insecurity comes that the issue stays in their mind day and night and if it is possible to have

324
01:05:42,861 --> 01:05:54,549
 the other people there, next to them, all the time examining them and asking them questions, after questions.

325
01:05:54,550 --> 01:06:01,959
You go to the super market and there is a cashier and you ask the man, 'do you like this girl?'

326
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:08,550
'No I don't like, I just go there and I pay the money and I go'. 'Yes but the other time you delayed

327
01:06:08,551 --> 01:06:17,719
are you sure you don't like her?'. 'No, I don't like her'. 'Yrs but......'. They try and try.

328
01:06:20,730 --> 01:06:30,259
 The other person in a state of Ign., most probably during these periods say, forget it, we separate.

329
01:06:31,370 --> 01:06:34,940
It is not possible, you are crazy.

330
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:49,529
There is no violence, there is no passion involved but this feeling of betrayal of the other person.

331
01:06:51,060 --> 01:07:00,879
They understand what they are doing, it's going to destroy my marriage and they cannot stop it.

332
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:17,879
They will go on and on and on until the other person says, forget it. I'm going right now.

333
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:27,460
That is the time when Ign. will stop.

334
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:38,720
But they have to reach the other person to their limits and be threatened, that's it. Then they will stop.

335
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:52,419
They will stop for a period of time, it goes away like nothing existed there until a month later, 2,3 months later.

336
01:07:52,420 --> 01:08:03,509
Then there is another bulge that comes again and these people take Lach., Hyos., whatever you like, no effect.

337
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:15,520
But you see the refinement in these people.

338
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:38,479
If it is a man, even if it's a strong man, will not ever think of hitting though the impulse sometimes may be there.

339
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:47,719
Don't forget, Ign. and Nux-v. are similar in their chemical consistency.

340
01:08:50,550 --> 01:08:56,119
But their behavior is totally different.

341
01:08:56,120 --> 01:09:06,679
We have also another interesting remedy which we don't use it very frequently, it's Gall-ac.

342
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:23,919
This is a remedy which has jealousy expressed in children, straight away with violence.

343
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:38,830
Children that have personality problems, personality disorders; at the same time jealousy; at the same time

344
01:09:38,831 --> 01:09:45,759
 aggressiveness, in these children you have to think of Gall-ac.

345
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:53,529
If you don't have jealousy, you are not normal. If you have jealousy, you need a homeopathic remedy.

346
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:20,520
So there is a balance in all these feelings, in which somebody felt jealousy 1-2  times in their lives or 3, 5 times

347
01:10:20,521 --> 01:10:27,729
 this is not a matter where you write down jealousy. This type of jealousy has to stay all the time

348
01:10:27,730 --> 01:10:35,679
 and it has to be there overwhelming the patient and be a problem, a limitation.

349
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:40,159
Otherwise jealousy is nice, he has some jealousy.

350
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:52,940
I felt jealous because I thought, you know. This even to express it, to say it, it brings interesting conversations.

351
01:10:54,090 --> 01:11:02,139
But to keep it inside, I'm jealous and I'll kill
 you one day. This is a problem.

352
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:22,239
What about Puls.? Puls. is jealous, expressing jealousy but through expressing jealousy it demands attention.

353
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:34,899
For Puls. is easy to say, I'm jealous. Therefore hug me and pet me. Hug me, I'm jealous.

354
01:11:41,090 --> 01:11:51,560
I exaggerate a little bit but this is the tendency and the intention of jealousy.

355
01:11:53,250 --> 01:12:19,579
If they don't pay attention, they can become angry and want to show that they are strong.

356
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:36,159
The man is there and this goes quite away from his head. Never to hit.

357
01:12:42,640 --> 01:13:01,919
The jealousy of Staph. is because it is a sexual individual. That means sexuality and erotic feelings are strong for Staph.

358
01:13:03,610 --> 01:13:12,289
Therefore the attachment of Staph. is very strong, very great but without demand.

359
01:13:12,290 --> 01:13:22,639
Somebody who is attached but never demands of his own what is due to the person.

360
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:39,730
Accepts, admits all kinds of atrocities, all kinds of misbehavior on the other person but the jealousy is felt inside

361
01:13:39,731 --> 01:13:46,879
 without being expressed.

362
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:58,010
Stram. and Nux-v. will attack immediately.

363
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:08,520
 Hyos. will wait until such time that all these feelings of jealousy are kept inside and then they explode

364
01:14:08,521 --> 01:14:10,939
and then they can kill.

365
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:20,939
Do you see the difference? The Med. will have an explosion, the explosion is going on and then have sex

366
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:32,039
after the explosion and everything is OK.
Next time. Next time until he finds another.

367
01:14:55,950 --> 01:15:00,439
 Med. makes the person say, I'm an admirer
of woman, let's say it simply.

368
01:15:07,150 --> 01:15:18,879
Med. loves the idea of woman because the hormones are quite high and at the same time there is a kind

369
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:34,199
of artistic feelings.They will not go and say, 'I like you, would you like to sleep with me?'. They never do that.

370
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:45,080
The Plat. will do it, the Med. never. They will approach a woman, they will say you are so beautiful

371
01:15:45,081 --> 01:15:55,279
they will find exactly what flatters the woman and they will tell it.

372
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:16,000
They create a situation where there is a kind of psychical closeness.

373
01:16:18,530 --> 01:16:23,760
Even if it is from morning till night, they have to create that situation.

374
01:16:23,761 --> 01:16:28,859
They cannot go coldly and have sex.
You understand the difference?

375
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:40,400
Therefore the jealousy is with passion for a certain person which does not last long.
