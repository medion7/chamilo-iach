1
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,457
Calc.is the most easy remedy.

2
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:14,167
I was in America and one of my best students there, presented to me a case. He has given about 20 remedies without effect.

3
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:22,937
I take the case. I say, this is a case of Calc.. He says, oh my God I can see now.

4
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:31,880
It's an easy remedy but sometimes difficult to recognize.

5
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:43,077
So in Calc. the first thing that we'll see in the mental-emotional, a lot of fears.

6
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:56,727
Fear of dark, fear of heights. Fear of insanity it's strong, of getting crazy.

7
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:07,347
Oh my God, am I getting crazy? How I feel like that? Fear of dark, fear of ghosts, fear of thunderstorms

8
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:16,607
  fear of dogs, rats, fear of death, fear of disease, fear of cancer, fear of anxiety about health.

9
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:24,600
All kinds of fears you get with Calc.

10
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:39,207
And the great keynote is despair of recovery.
 Shall I ever be better? Shall I ever recover?

11
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:53,080
This is something that it is almost ingrained in them, almost deep inside. Their belief that they are not going to get well.

12
00:02:53,153 --> 00:03:03,447
 That despair of recovery also you cannote in your notes of Arsenicum.

13
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:16,067
That has anxiety about health, fear about death, has despair of recovery as strong as Calc.

14
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:30,297
The two remedies are worse from cold, both Calc. and Arsenicum.

15
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:46,527
They are having despair of recovery but the Arsenicum is usually lean persons with good combustion

16
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:57,847
burning of the food where Calc. has bad combustion and therefore putting on weight easily.

17
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:11,617
They take little food but they pick up a lot of weight. Calc. is one of these remedies that we prescribe for obesity.

18
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:26,427
Easily putting on weight. Obesity and flabbiness. The muscles are flabby.

19
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:52,767
The tissues are soft and watery. The muscles are not strong. Children which are flabby with big bellies.

20
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:08,447
Sensitive to cold, cold hands and especially feet. Calc. usually will tell you, 90% of the cases

21
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:20,210
I sleep with a hot water bottle.
Or I sleep with my socks on. 90% of the cases.

22
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:30,447
And they are cold in their extremities and at the same time, sweat.

23
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:37,390
They say cold, sweat, immediately your mind goes to Calc.

24
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:47,250
I reduced the whole Materia Medica into 2 days.

25
00:05:53,980 --> 00:06:04,147
You need to study and learn by heart very few points, but these points if you remember, I can guarantee

26
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:09,167
that you will be able to spot immediately the remedy.

27
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:23,250
Just remember it's not only one point. You have to combine three points of the remedy. 1,2,3 at least.

28
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:38,987
Sweat on the back of head and cervical region during sleep. Very good symptom for children who are perspiring

29
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:51,337
in this area cervical area and their pillow, you go in the night, in the child and you see the pillow is wet.

30
00:06:52,640 --> 00:07:03,327
90% of the cases, this is a Calc. child. Just because he sweats around this area.

31
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:22,487
If there is a patient, I tell you another secret, who has strong desire for sweets and desire for soft
boiled eggs

32
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:31,450
these two things most probably you solved the case of cancer, he has a cancer, whatever.

33
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:48,670
This combination makes a case of Calc. If you ask a question like this, the next question that you will ask is what?

34
00:07:48,740 --> 00:08:01,660
What do you like to eat? I love sweets and also I love soft boiled eggs. You said, thank God I finished the case.

35
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:08,747
But before I finished the case, I put one question. What will be this question?

36
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:30,760
It will be whether it is perspiring here. In the night during sleep, do you perspire? Yes. Where? Here. They will show here.

37
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:44,180
If they don't have this, then the next question is how do you react to the cold?

38
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,830
Calc. must say, I don't like cold.

39
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:55,460
Ok thank you. Calc., go.

40
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:08,970
You don't believe because I have been teaching, ok you have to take the case. I will teach you how to take the case.

41
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:20,420
I have asked one doctor from the center, in Thursday morning, they will teach you how to take the case, what to ask etc.

42
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:32,030
But if you don't know these points, you will be lost.

43
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:42,960
It doesn't matter how well you can take a case. These points are invaluable.

44
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:51,340
 If you manage to remember them,
you'll be fantastic prescribers.

45
00:09:53,600 --> 00:10:01,890
You will see no remedy looks like the other. So immediately you short out the situation.

46
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:11,450
Immediately you say, ok a lot of perspiration. Where? In the whole body.

47
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:17,190
Immediately your mind goes Tuberculinum, Ferrum, Sambucus.

48
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:28,690
You know these remedies are perspiring a lot. Perspire here, Calc., Lachesis, Phosphoric acid.

49
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:45,540
 Unless you know this, you are lost in so many questions that we can ask a human being  in order to find the key.

50
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:55,140
And the key here it might be despair of recovery.

51
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:07,790
You ask, you ask and you're not knowing where you are going and suddenly the patient comes out with the idea

52
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:15,610
'forget about my case, I know I'm incurable'.

53
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:26,160
You are thinking of Calc., it is confirmed by this expression of the patient.

54
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:37,000
-But a very young baby, how do you prescribe? Is it true that a very big proportion of babies, a very big proportion of us

55
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:40,010
 at the beginning of our life, are Calc.?

56
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:46,040
-Yes, and there is an explanation for that, I will tell you.

57
00:11:46,110 --> 00:12:02,490
The baby needs a lot of Calcium to build up the skeleton.

58
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:09,677
It needs food from which to take easily Calcium, to build up the skeleton. What is this food?

59
00:12:09,749 --> 00:12:22,130
 Soft boiled eggs. So the baby what you give it, what he likes, soft boiled eggs. He likes it very much.

60
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:35,300
Perspires here, Calc. These two things, never mind what the baby has. The baby has upset in the stomach

61
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:45,780
 it has diarrhea, it has an eczema, whatever. Just these two questions. You short it out in the baby.

62
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:56,210
And the babies usually need the Calc. because the Calcium is disturbed primarily.

63
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:08,770
They cannot absorb it and they have problems. The organism starts crying out. Give me Calcium, give me more soft eggs.

64
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:14,450
 I need more and more. Never mind how much you give, they need more, why? Because they cannot absorb it.

65
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:20,730
You give Calc. and everything falls into place.

66
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:35,949
- Is it right that the metabolism would function better after Calc. in such a case?

67
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,730
-Yes. Metabolism also yes.

68
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:49,489
-Do you have the experience that a flabby child will become a small, tall after this remedy?

69
00:13:49,570 --> 00:14:01,890
-Yes. Not immediately. Not after a week but as he grows up, you see the change.

70
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:11,330
There are things that you cannot expect to correct immediately. You have to wait quite a lot.

71
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,080
Also you don't change remedies.

72
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:45,900
Discontent is the key word for Calc-p.
A person who needs Calc-p. must be  discontent person.

73
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:57,960
Calc-p. from children to grown ups, they are discontent. The children will cry.

74
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:07,070
You say, what is wrong with you. They don't know.

75
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:15,560
They can drive the parents crazy.

76
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:37,890
This is one and the second keynote is an aggravation from weather. When there is cold and wet.

77
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:56,860
Especially this comes when there is the time when the snow melts; that period is very very bad for Calc-p.

78
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:07,330
They become full of pains, full of arthritic conditions and complaining all the time during such a period.

79
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:25,810
Complaining and moaning. In the night for instance you will hear if you sleep with somebody, they moan.

80
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:44,290
As if they are in deep pain. They sleep deeply, they cannot wake up easily and they moan.

81
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:57,740
There is always this attitude of I do not feel well but they do not know what is wrong with them.

82
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:10,910
You will never get a Calc-p. child to tell you what is wrong with him, whether he has pain, headache etc.

83
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:38,230
And another characteristic for Calc-p. is that they will get headaches, if they push themselves to study.

84
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:49,330
They don't want to study, they are not up to the point of study. They push themselves, especially the children, the mother

85
00:17:49,400 --> 00:18:00,100
the father push them to study and they apply themselves and they try and here they come with a headache.

86
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:12,520
So children who go to school and start with headaches, usually they will need Calc-p.

87
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:27,210
Also it has an effect on the fontanelles. Where they remain open for long period of time.

88
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:37,730
Fontanelles remain open and they are soft.
You touch them here and still it's not closed.

89
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:47,936
 They are 2 years old and it is not closed properly; that is a sign of Calc-p.

90
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:22,020
There is another point which is very strong in Calc-p., which is the sighing.

91
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:32,970
It is similar to Ignatia, that we'll learn later on, but does not come because of grief.

92
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:43,740
It comes because of a kind of difficulty in taking a deep breath.

93
00:19:45,560 --> 00:20:01,080
It is organic; in Ignatia it is emotional, stress and grief that brings this difficulty. In Calc-p. is organic.

94
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:15,890
So there is a discontent individual, sighing, moaning. Children moan much more and then it is strange

95
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:29,370
that this remedy wants to go away and feel better when they go away from the place where they live.

96
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:49,040
Travelling, desires to travel. People who feel happy only if they travel. And they enjoy only the changes.

97
00:20:51,120 --> 00:21:00,280
There is another remedy also which desires to travel, which is Tuberculinum, but for another reason.

98
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:13,380
I don't want to mix it now. I want you to establish yourself in the discontent, in the sighing, in the moaning.

99
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:31,050
No satisfaction, no joy for life and then the only outlet is to leave the place and travel and go and see other places.

100
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,280
That idea is quite strong.

101
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:56,430
There are individuals who are quite duty bound, that means Calc-p. wants to finish her studies.

102
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:09,020
Even if she is not up to the point, she wants to finish her studies, to do her homework. Therefore she's pushing herself

103
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:15,890
and therefore she's getting the headaches. Studying makes the headaches come.

104
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:24,490
Another point is the stiffness which comes on the cervical region.

105
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:37,050
Stiffness on cervical region is characteristic. We see people who are doing all the time this.

106
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:55,330
And then they go to climates where it's cold and wet and becomes very stiff and the mind seems to be

107
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:02,520
 stuffed up and they are not happy.

108
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:24,770
The mind is dull and stuffy. It seems as if by contracting the muscles here, it prevents the circulation on the head.

109
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:29,850
That feeling again comes.

110
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:42,530
On the contrary they can be quite well and happy in an environment where it's warm and dry.

111
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:20,570
Though it comes from the Calcarea family, does not have much with Calcarea apart from aggravation from cold and wet.

112
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:34,090
Otherwise they are not obese, usually they are people who are quite lean and their desires are totally different

113
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:50,080
 than the desires of Calc. We said, the desires are for Calc. sweets and eggs.

114
00:24:50,150 --> 00:25:03,990
 Here in Calc-p. they need something more tasty and especially they like smoked meat.

115
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:12,590
You will see Causticum, it's another remedy we shall be talking soon, it has similar symptomatology

116
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:17,840
 but great difference in the weather reaction.

117
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:28,340
Also very frequently you will see scoliosis on the spine, why?

118
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:39,290
 Because scoliosis comes when children are pushed to do things that they don't like.

119
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:54,060
And they are nice, soft children which are pushed to do or themselves feel that they must do certain things that they don't like.

120
00:25:54,130 --> 00:26:02,730
So Calc-p. is one of those people who do something they don't like just because they have to do it.

121
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:25,570
And just because they have to do it, here comes the stiffness. They feel the responsibilities which they have and it is too much for them.

122
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:40,890
And then the stiffness appears here. Strange symptoms of strange human beings.

123
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:51,160
I have to make an observation.

124
00:26:51,230 --> 00:27:02,210
The discontent on the remedy is because of no reason; there is no reason.

125
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:08,540
You say the child everything is ok, why you are like this?

126
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:23,150
There is no reason. But if the child loses his mother he will be discontent because his mother left him

127
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:35,930
and is gone for 20 days away. That is not a symptom. The symptoms is, without reason.

128
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:44,470
If you lose somebody and you cry is not a symptom.

129
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:58,890
Children are forced by themselves, by their sense of duty they are forced to do certain things.

130
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:12,290
'I have to do it. The mother says, I have to do it'. They are duty bound they can force themselves to study;

131
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:17,050
 they will sit down and study quite a lot though they don't feel like doing it.

132
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:22,650
Because they are already in a state of discontent. If they do it, they develop headaches.

133
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,690
And these are the children that they will develop headaches every day.

134
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:34,660
From the moment they start the school, they have headaches. The school stops, the headaches stop.

135
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:44,690
Also if they are in the school and they do not study, they don't get headaches.

136
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:54,210
 Everybody is to be blamed because we are living in an environment and everything that happens, can have an effect.

137
00:28:55,510 --> 00:29:12,170
But we get the end result of all this. So usually when the parents will telephone you about the child, about a Calc-p. child

138
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:25,370
they will be totally out of their mind. They telephone you and say, 'what can I do with this child?

139
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:34,200
I don't know what is wrong. I ask him and all the time from morning till night is moaning and groaning'.

140
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:51,810
I've seen a case where the father took the child at 3 o'clock in the morning, out on the streets, to try to calm him down

141
00:29:51,880 --> 00:30:00,730
because he was crying and moaning and living in an apartment, it was disturbing the neighbors.

142
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:10,410
So he took him at 3 o'clock. He says, 'I don't know what to do with this child'. That kind of discontent.

143
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:23,950
When you hear this story then you say, that's Calc-p.

144
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:35,190
But then I tried to give you a little bit of insight into the remedy and I say, well also these children that are discontent

145
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:39,250
 not all these children will be so discontent.

146
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:46,030
But they will have some other symptoms. What are the other symptoms that they may have.

147
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:53,780
When they push themselves to study by the parents, by themselves, they develop headaches.

148
00:30:55,280 --> 00:31:05,344
And what they want to do? They want to go in a warm, dry climate. And what else they want to do? They want to travel.

149
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:16,110
They want to change the place because they are not happy; they feel in the environment which they live, they are not happy.

150
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:32,764
So it seems the same with Ignatia. Ignatia who is also sighing, wants to travel. You get a colitis, even ulcerative colitis.

151
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:49,850
Ulcerative colitis in Ignatia. And they say, if I take the plane and I go, the moment I arrive in the new place, my colitis stops.

152
00:31:49,920 --> 00:32:01,590
This is a symptom. You will hear these extreme things seldom but then you have a very strong symptom.

153
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:13,200
Now Calc-p. they will not say that. They say, I like to travel, I like to see but they are not better from travelling.

154
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:15,000
You see the difference?

155
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:26,940
They have desire to travel and they feel psychologically only that they are having some kind of enjoyment.

156
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:30,650
Otherwise there is lack of joy.

157
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,300
Complaining.

158
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,750
You say, what do you want?

159
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:54,720
If you see, there are other remedies that will react differently.

160
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:05,810
-I want to come back to my point. Would you say that psychologically there was not a good enough mother

161
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:13,830
or children may be born like that or you cannot say exactly this side or the other side?

162
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:23,810
-We cannot separate, neither we can blame the parents at these cases. At least to my understanding I have not seen it.

163
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:32,390
Because you give the remedy and the child becomes normal and everybody is happy. The parents and the child.

164
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:42,390
So I cannot say the child came to that position because the parents were mistreating the child or misguiding the child

165
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:50,140
or doing something to the child. I have not seen this because once they get the Calc-p. they come back

166
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:54,320
and all the family is happy.

167
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:06,890
-Can the headache be a chronic migraine or a periodically appearing migraine or it has to be directly and after the exertion?

168
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:21,240
-It has to be aggravated. Let us it's a chronic headache but it must be aggravated after studying.

169
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,410
That means using your eyes and your brain.

170
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:31,740
-It has to be mental exertion?
-Mental exertion.

171
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:42,850
But if there is mental exertion in general, I mean you run and then you have a headache because you run, this is different.

172
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,570
This is Calc.

173
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:52,410
-Fulfilling household duties?
-Yes, fulfilling household duties Calc.

174
00:34:54,490 --> 00:35:06,280
The Calc-p. has to have this mental exertion together with study. Then we have the real symptoms of Calc-p.

175
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:39,090
Now the Calc-s. is a remedy you will need in cases where you will have situations where you have suppuration.

176
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:45,340
That means an inflammation which suppurates and keeps on discharging.

177
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:57,180
Whether this is an otitis, whether it is a fistula in the anus, whether it is acne.

178
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:10,650
And it's discharging, discharging. The acne of Calc-p. is terrible to look, why?

179
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:17,650
Because it is full of acne here and it's discharging all the time. What happens?

180
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:34,410
They come out liquid and pus will form crusts. So at any time when you have a look it's all this crusts, all these discharges

181
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:44,920
which have come out and if she washes of course, then it stays for some time only the acne.

182
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:55,930
But after an hour, two hours, three hours then it becomes full of pus, dry pus and crust.

183
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:05,250
And the look is really ugly though the situation might not be as bad.

184
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:23,810
You remember I told you about a Professor who became my student and eventually he let me see his patient.

185
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:32,820
He opened the door like this and said, 'look this is the patient'. So I looked, I don't appear.

186
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:47,770
I see his face. He thought, you know, I was a magician, I just look and I know the remedy.

187
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:52,760
Because that was his experience, he thought I can do everything.

188
00:37:52,830 --> 00:38:07,290
But in this particular case, I look and I see that face. It was a girl 28, 29. And then I said, what other symptoms.

189
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:14,030
He gives me some nonsense symptoms.
And then I said, ok give Calc-s.

190
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:29,730
The people who are breeding bees, they are the most healthy. And I have found again and again that this is true.

191
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:42,900
And almost all of them invariably, they let the bees sting them. They push the bee to sting them.

192
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:58,230
And they keep a very good health by doing that, why? They bring out to the surface all the reactions.

193
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:15,730
And I have found out they are all very sweet people, sweet natures, very human, very compassionate and very healthy.

194
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:25,330
-In Israel it's called "apiterapia" and it's by bees stings and we've seen cancer patients that are treated.

195
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:34,070
During chemotherapy in order to take it better, they come before and 30-40 stings done to them and then their cells

196
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:41,745
are reacting so much better. And the immune system is taking it easier and their vitality is better and better.

197
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:46,110
-I believe it. That's why I brought the wasps here.

198
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:57,970
I said something wrong. I told a lie.

199
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:14,023
So, as I said, he telephoned, I think one month later, because every month would see the patient.

200
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:22,460
He says, 'do you remember this patient with the acne?' I said yes, the Calc-s. case.

201
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:29,030
He thought it was unbelievable that I could remember the remedies but for me it was very simple because

202
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:35,370
 I would connect one with the other. The pathology, 'do you remember the case with rhinitis?'

203
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:47,890
I said yes Hecla Lava, I would remember. He said, 'do you remember? Yes the Calc-s.'. 'I kissed her'.

204
00:40:57,450 --> 00:41:08,220
So what he meant of course, you understand, the face was so clean that he kissed her.

205
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:26,730
Now this remedy goes a little bit further than discontent and becomes nasty.

206
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:38,560
It's a good word, I just found it, nasty.

207
00:41:51,340 --> 00:42:01,940
And also very jealous and also a little bit malicious.

208
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:08,100
There is maliciousness, there is jealousy.

209
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:45,430
There is this kind of discharge which is coming out. The idea is, pus is coming out, just get the idea.

210
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:59,890
Pus is coming out all the time, on a psychological level it is the same thing.

211
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:11,120
We describe it as nastiness, maliciousness, jealousy.

212
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:29,340
It loses the discontent element. It goes to something else which is deeper and which is worse actually.

213
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:43,380
It is more on the destructive side and then if you close these discharges, then the state which we describe

214
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:54,550
the maliciousness, it's all the time oozing out ill emotions, bad emotions.

215
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:07,170
If you let the discharge go on, then these kind of emotions will be subsiding.

216
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:20,200
Here we have again another keynote which is desire for fruits which are green, not ripe.

217
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:33,530
Sour fruits, green fruits, unripe fruits like Medorrhinum.

218
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:42,360
-Calc-s., the pus has a certain smell to it?

219
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:08,840
-No, it's not specific smell. If there is a smell on the discharge, then we have another remedy. If it is very offensive

220
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:20,870
we have Psorinum, Graphites. Now of course it may have some smell, it may have all kind of other symptoms

221
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:29,620
but I say when these symptoms are present, think of Calc-s.

222
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:41,570
You said, when the discharge closes then the oozing becomes internal. Is it that in the beginning stages

223
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:47,540
 when the oozing is outside, the internal oozing is not there?

224
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:59,420
I say yes, it might be there but as a potential. You close it and then it comes the psychological state, it comes more and more.

225
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:17,890
Every remedy has or may have symptoms on mental, emotional and physical. If the force of the disease is on the

226
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:28,690
 physical body, the mental and emotional becomes free. For all remedies. The same with Calc-s.

227
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:38,180
So when we talk about mental or physical does not mean that you will find all the symptoms, mental and physical.

228
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:48,810
You may have only mental, only physical or you may have a combination. Some mental and some physical.

229
00:46:56,170 --> 00:47:05,080
If I have a case with symptoms on the mental-emotional level, does that mean if I give a treatment

230
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:15,900
that the disease will invariably come on the skin or on the physical body?

231
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:25,540
Not invariably but many times it will pass through the body. That means you may have development

232
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:31,770
of bodily symptoms and finally you may have the appearance on the skin.

233
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:43,550
Not always because if the disturbance on the mental-emotional is not really deep, then you may just

234
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:49,380
eliminate this without passing through the physical body.

235
00:47:53,390 --> 00:48:02,430
Sometimes you can see symptoms of Sulphur and Calc. and almost equally, symptoms belonging to Calc.

236
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:12,590
symptoms belonging to Sulphur and then you may combine. And sometimes it works, not always.

237
00:48:33,301 --> 00:48:41,740
We go now to another remedy which is a contemporary remedy for the young.

238
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:58,650
For the pleasure of the young and see what happens if you use this remedy very frequently.

239
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:13,890
The provings show that people who are using this Cann-i. very frequently, they go into all kinds of delusions.

240
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:44,830
So people who are using a lot of Cann-i., they develop a lot of delusions, all kinds of delusion.

241
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:50,370
You have a delusion, you name it, Cann-i. will have it.

242
00:49:52,380 --> 00:50:04,500
So it confuses the mind actually while at the same time activating the mind.

243
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:10,770
It activates the mind and confuses it.

244
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:18,490
What happens in this case? What is the end result of such a state?

245
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:31,530
It's an individual who is thinking, thinking all the time but not in a coherent way.

246
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:46,220
Without clarity. With a lot of so called, creativity. He may have a lot of creative ideas, he may have a lot of

247
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:53,010
explanations why everything is happening. They find an explanation.

248
00:50:53,080 --> 00:51:01,710
And the mind is very very creative but no coherence, no clarity. There is a confusion and in the end

249
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:08,450
 they end up going into delusion. Delusional states.

250
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:34,420
Let's think of those people with this mind. The first thing that they feel is that they do not have control over their mind.

251
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:45,850
They lose the control over their mind. Just think for a moment that you may be losing control of your mind.

252
00:51:45,920 --> 00:52:02,204
What will be the first fear that will develop within you? My mind goes by itself, I can't stop it. I'm getting crazy.

253
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:24,310
So under this condition, Cann-i. will present tremendous fear, tremendous panic, losing control and then losing their mind.

254
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:36,440
Therefore fear of insanity develops to such tremendous degree but they will not call it fear of insanity.

255
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:45,800
They will call it something different, losing control many times. At least in my experience, people say

256
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:51,510
'I feel I'm losing control'. What do you mean?In a panic state.

257
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:59,620
The panic state comes and they feel that they are going to lose control and something terrible will happen.

258
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:07,510
As I said in the beginning, we talked about the disconnectedness.

259
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:21,146
The Cann-i. state for a person who is sensitive to Cann-i., not if you take just one Cann-i. these things will happen.

260
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:26,420
But you have to be sensitive to it and you have to do it repeatedly.

261
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:40,490
Now if you do it, then you lose the connectedness and you have very easily disconnected

262
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:52,410
the etheric body from the physical body. And then they may feel that either they fly or they don't step down

263
00:53:52,480 --> 00:54:05,210
or that one arm, for instance, is raising by itself. It's a terrifying experience because they cannot stop it.

264
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:13,140
The arm is raising, they feel my arm is going up, what is this? In a delusion state of course.

265
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:22,010
And that situation brings about such fear, such panic, I'm going crazy.

266
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:40,210
And that fastness of the mind, thinking, brings on another symptom, we see in other remedies

267
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:54,210
which is loquacity, extreme loquacity. It's a specific loquacity.

268
00:54:57,620 --> 00:55:11,530
I will give you some differential diagnosis with Lachesis. Lachesis has a lot of loquacity and she starts like this:

269
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:23,300
You say, how are you? She comes there, what's your problem? And she says:

270
00:55:24,310 --> 00:55:37,810
'all my life I have been suffering with headaches and flushes of heat. Also I have stomach problems

271
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:52,890
and shall I tell you the story? When I was in Thessaloniki I met somebody, he is the friend of a friend.

272
00:55:52,960 --> 00:56:07,570
And we had to go for some period of time together and while we were travelling together, we met somebody

273
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:16,970
who was a known friend of my cousin.
So.... it goes on like this.

274
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:31,230
In the end you have no symptoms of course but you have this kind of going all around the world, all her life meeting people

275
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:41,700
 talking to people and then jumping from one subject to another without any stop. In the end of one hour you say,

276
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:45,610
I had enough of your symptoms, Lachesis, go.

277
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:55,180
Next time she speaks a little bit less. Now Cann-i. also we says loquacity.

278
00:56:55,250 --> 00:57:07,450
What kind of loquacity? It's totally different because you discuss with them. He brings the subject on Homeopathy

279
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:21,400
 because you are a homeopath and he will make a nice theory of why the remedies are acting, what is the theoretical

280
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:32,330
 basis of energy medicine and they have all kinds of explanation, how the remedy must be working.

281
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:46,090
'I think I have this feeling that the remedy must be affecting a level, rather the consciousness level I think.

282
00:57:46,160 --> 00:58:03,370
And through that, it may affect your feelings. If the feelings are affected, then eventually you may have an effect

283
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:08,170
 on the physical body but I'm not sure exactly about that'.

284
00:58:13,610 --> 00:58:22,490
This is a loquacity, a theoretical, you say my God he has the answer for everything!

285
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:32,570
You can stay with him for hours and he will volunteer to give you his own opinion.

286
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:40,110
But in the end, the mind you feel is so confused!

287
00:58:52,890 --> 00:58:58,150
He, himself, does not perceive. He will not say, my mind is confused.

288
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:06,750
You perceive that the mind is really confused. And he is theorizing and theorizing....

289
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:28,570
One case, he was describing why he was in that state and he attributed to the encounter he had with a woman.

290
00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:43,330
And how the woman reacted and what he did and all the theory about the relation, the woman etc.

291
00:59:49,680 --> 01:00:02,090
In the end you say, my God his mind is almost totally gone. There is also a very interesting element in them.

292
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:19,260
You do not feel, as we said in Calc-s., any sting, any hardness.

293
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:43,980
There is a kind of an acceptance. You tell Cann-i. that I feel that Sirius, Sirius is a star, is ascending some influence on the planet

294
01:00:44,050 --> 01:00:51,650
 trying to raise the consciousness of the planet. It's a great theory for him, he will believe it immediately

295
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:59,580
 that most probably it is like that or he will bring himself, another theory to explain to you how...

296
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:22,330
You understand the mentality of the person? He is believing, he is gullible. No critique.

297
01:01:23,370 --> 01:01:44,040
That is why the new generation which has been raised up with Cann-i., is the generation that accepts everything.

298
01:01:45,090 --> 01:01:55,280
You tell them anything and the mind is not critical at all. They say, why not, it may happen.

299
01:01:56,350 --> 01:02:07,120
It's not impossible, don't be closed minded, this can happen, that can happen, everything can happen.

300
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:21,370
And you sit back and you say, my God there is no critical mind? It breaks the critical faculty of the mind.

301
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:27,070
Cann-i. breaks the critical faculty of the mind.

302
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:38,050
He talks and talks and theories and you see behind there is no critique to say, what the hell I'm talking about?

303
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:40,320
There is no such a thing.

304
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:48,660
Where you have other remedies, they are very critical of course.

305
01:02:58,410 --> 01:03:03,570
-The Cannabis will be mostly indicated to people that have been taking hashish in the youth?

306
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:08,920
-Many times yes.
-Would you give it to somebody that never took hashish?

307
01:03:08,990 --> 01:03:11,890
-Yes, definitely.

308
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:31,220
Greeks by the time I was practicing back in 1970 where most of the American youth has tried Cann-i.

309
01:03:31,290 --> 01:03:48,770
on a percentage like 95%, Greeks youngsters, very, very few had used it by this time. Yet the remedy was indicated

310
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:59,500
 in spite of the fact, they never had Cann-i. themselves. But what I had observed all these years

311
01:03:59,570 --> 01:04:13,070
is that people who used Cann-i. in a kind of regular way, they became not actually confused but there is

312
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:23,490
no clearness in their mind anymore. Even if they have stopped taking the drug 10 years ago.

313
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:32,100
 So the young generation has to be careful.

314
01:04:32,170 --> 01:04:38,980
Because it's not as simple as you think it is.

315
01:04:41,237 --> 01:04:51,860
-To treat somebody with chronic Cann-i. intoxication, wouldn't that be isopathy if you give them

316
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:57,400
Cann-i. as a homeopathic remedy?

317
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:19,400
-No. You see isopathy in Homeopathy is just words. If you use, in a mechanical way, the substance

318
01:05:19,470 --> 01:05:26,770
that produced some situation, this is isopathy and this is not correct.

319
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:33,650
But if the symptoms of Cann-i. are there after Cann-i., then you give Cann-i..

320
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:45,660
But you can take Cann-i. and you develop symptoms of Pulsatilla. You can take Cann-i. and develop symptoms of Calc.

321
01:05:45,730 --> 01:05:52,020
You can take Cann-i. and develop symptoms of Mancinella. Different remedies.

322
01:05:52,090 --> 01:06:00,400
But if you take Cann-i. and develop symptoms of Cann-i. then it's homeopathic, it's not isopathic.

323
01:06:00,470 --> 01:06:07,640
Because the symptoms of the remedy are there. Is it clear?

324
01:06:08,410 --> 01:06:15,120
-No, it's not clear. I expected the symptoms to disappear when I gave Cann-i. as a remedy.

325
01:06:16,530 --> 01:06:20,220
-When to give Cann-i.? When you have that picture.

326
01:06:20,290 --> 01:06:23,100
-When I have that picture and I give the remedy ...

327
01:06:23,170 --> 01:06:31,061
-Then you can give the remedy Cann-i whether the person has taken Cann-i. or not.

328
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:41,470
But not because somebody has taken Cann-i., not because of that you just go and give Cann-i.

329
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:48,140
Because Cann-i. may have produced a state of Gelsemium, not Cann-i.

330
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:58,450
-I can just say the background. I have several toxicomanes, heroin addicted patients and some of them have the picture

331
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:05,402
of Cann-i. And I never dared to treat them as Cann-i. as homeopathic remedy. Because it was isopahy.

332
01:07:09,590 --> 01:07:19,850
-You can. Sure you can. If they have that picture it doesn't matter if they are from heroin or cocaine or whatever.

333
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:26,133
Because all these are hallucinogenic drugs.
