1
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:40,569
Staph. is full of feelings.
Feelings that cannot be expressed.

2
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:54,640
It's a remedy which has been sensitized in its feelings...

3
00:00:54,641 --> 00:01:03,439
that means the feelings are sensitive,
strong and therefore vulnerable.

4
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:17,220
If you have a lot of feelings, you feel for everything, then you are exposed to vulnerability.

5
00:01:17,221 --> 00:01:25,119
You can be easily hurt. If you close
your feelings, then you can protect yourself.

6
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:43,099
Staph. therefore wants to protect
itself by not expressing the feelings.

7
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,000
Not that she does not have the feelings.

8
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:53,978
Nat-m. does not have the feelings.
 Cuts down the feelings, no feelings.

9
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:10,079
Sepia no feelings but Ignatia is in between Nat-m. and Staph. and Staph. has feelings but they cannot be expressed.

10
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,969
Can you understand this? Cannot be expressed.

11
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:23,359
The reason is because she has been hurt repeatedly.

12
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:48,159
And then she decides that it is better not to have a confrontation because always she is the one who loses.

13
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,350
Never felt bad in a consultation.

14
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,529
 I'll explain to you. Do you know why
you feel bad in a consultation?

15
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:13,999
Somebody comes and you feel bad, that means you feel tired and then you say, he sucked my energy and this and that.

16
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:22,980
What is happening actually is that there is no communication.

17
00:03:22,981 --> 00:03:34,609
If a person is closed, no feelings, only brain is working  and talking and you try to get information

18
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:40,880
 there is no real communication. You feel isolated.

19
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:52,379
A patient like that is a patient who belongs to a group of remedies, different than other group.

20
00:03:52,380 --> 00:04:03,109
With Staph. she will never express her anger especially, she will sit there and she will have feelings.

21
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:09,619
That means there is going to be a communication, if you are open.

22
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:26,679
So you perceive only if your feelings are open. And you communicate and then you understand.

23
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:35,709
You will tell me, how can I be open to everybody? Everybody who comes there, first of all it's dangerous to be open.

24
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:44,599
Because you are exposed to a lot of dangers. The second thing is that it requires a lot of energy

25
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,609
to have feelings all the time for every patient who comes.

26
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:00,749
And then you are tired and exhausted. Feelings are gone. But at the same time see how you understand.

27
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:10,449
You have somebody with whom you live, your husband, your wife etc.

28
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:17,089
And she comes in the room,
 you look and say what's the matter?

29
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:22,829
She has said nothing. What's the matter?
What happened?

30
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:29,680
Can anybody else understand these
little changes in the face of that woman?

31
00:05:29,681 --> 00:05:36,829
Only the one who loves her, can understand. What happened? Something happened to you.

32
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,319
 The others don't realize anything.

33
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,589
So you love, you have feelings,
you understand in depth.

34
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:55,839
Nobody can tell you lies. You say, 'you
 are not feeling good today. Why?', 'Leave it'.

35
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:09,449
But the change, what you see is absolutely minimal in the face of the person and you can guarantee that

36
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:18,433
100, 200 people can see the person, cannot understand that this is happening in her, so inner feelings.

37
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:24,270
Only you can understand.
What are the changes? Minimal.

38
00:06:24,271 --> 00:06:32,589
Why you understand? Because you are open to that person. There is a communication then you understand.

39
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:42,729
Now a person comes to be treated and you are going to try to perceive what has happened in her feelings...

40
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:51,749
...in her soul, in her mental condition and
the bodily feelings are easily described.

41
00:06:52,650 --> 00:07:02,799
But this openess in communication is necessary. With Staph. you don't have a problem.

42
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:14,059
She will show you who she is. She is a sweet, sensitive person who will not ever be angry.

43
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:21,229
She will never be angry. It's a very nice feeling for you, for the husband, for anybody.

44
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:30,190
She is not going to demand...'I told you!'

45
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:41,409
Never from Staph. You will never get that reaction from Staph.

46
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:59,419
The anger is there, is inside but the more the anger, the more the trembling, the more the pressure

47
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:05,119
which develops inside but she will be controlled.

48
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:14,029
And she will withdraw the emotions but the emotions do not die with Staph. Emotions are there.

49
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:32,359
And in spite of the fact that the husband has many times insulted her, even in public.

50
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:45,429
If you do this with another remedy, with Sepia the feelings are gone very fast, with Nat-m. closed, finished, she insulted me.

51
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:49,639
With Nux-v, just closed and then it comes the anger back.

52
00:08:49,640 --> 00:09:05,399
With Staph. you insult and then she gets it inside but the feelings do not die. That means she keeps on loving the husband.

53
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:14,319
She can make sex with him the same night.
With Nat-m. forget it, five days.

54
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,280
Don't' touch me.

55
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:32,239
Staph. she seems to forget, why? Because the feelings are there, alive and she can communicate.

56
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:44,719
You see why in one case the woman says no and the other says yes? Because if the feelings are alive...

57
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,959
...there is communication, there is understanding, there is no this emptiness, this feeling of enstrangement.

58
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:15,009
  If the feelings are closed, you have sex with somebody? You feel, who is he, who is she?

59
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:19,089
This feelings of estrangement because there are no feelings.

60
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:26,749
Therefore Staph. will keep the anger inside but will keep the emotions as well.

61
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:40,590
As long as this can be tolerated. And she tolerates, she tolerates ...

62
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:49,759
...and that's why we say in Homeopathy ...

63
00:10:49,760 --> 00:11:05,559
...before you give Staph. you must think of the possibility what is going to happen, especially in a marriage situation.

64
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:16,759
Because the moment you give Staph.  then Staph. cannot anymore tolerate inside.

65
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,979
And she will hit back.

66
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:38,959
You give Staph. and the husband is very much used to come home, make me some coffee, take the newspaper...

67
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:47,449
Then one day she takes Staph. he comes home he says, 'make me the coffee', she says, 'you do it yourself'.

68
00:11:53,210 --> 00:12:00,209
You have said so many times, you are insensitive, you are this, you are that, Staph. comes out.

69
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:08,929
And there is a possibility of course he will be able to suppress again and then you repeat the potency, higher potency.

70
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:23,849
There are two things that may happen. One is that the husband decides to change his behavior or change woman.

71
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:37,879
There is no third solution. Sometimes the marriage becomes better, fuller, more complete and both are satisfied

72
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:48,269
 but sometimes also Staph. realizes I can't take it anymore and she may divorce.

73
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:56,635
In Staph. situation you see the social repercussions of disease.

74
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:07,429
You see we are living in a society which each one is diseased and we are interrelated.

75
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:17,539
And disease plays a major part
 in what we have created as a society today.

76
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:31,040
Who is the society today? What is doing? It's doing wars, killings....

77
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:41,479
...competition, anxiety. I want to attain more and more.

78
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:54,000
And then we lose the basics.
Staph. is a person who is close to health...

79
00:13:54,410 --> 00:14:04,029
... because it's more diseased to close
the emotions and stop the emotions. That is
 more diseased

80
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:12,050
 than Staph. Staph. closes, keeps the anger inside  cannot express the anger but still it's a better situation.

81
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:19,730
She is in a better place because still Staph. enjoys.

82
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:28,879
 If you don't have feelings, enjoyment goes away. In Sepia you remember we said, no feelings, she cannot even

83
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:38,199
enjoy her own children. No pleasure from looking at the children, playing, doing things, indifferent.

84
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,529
Sepia, no feelings.

85
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:56,919
That's why I said, when we see through Homeopathy, the feelings are reenergized, then that is very

86
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:03,850
very good to hear for Homeopathy.
For the progress of the person.

87
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:13,119
But the feelings may energize but maybe the heart is already in a bad condition, it breaks down or the liver

88
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:20,019
 is in a bad condition or the thyroid.

89
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,449
And then you have to carry on treating.

90
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:47,199
Then Staph. can go into the other extreme. That means she cannot tolerate anything at all and she loses control

91
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:52,099
and she starts reacting too much.

92
00:15:53,920 --> 00:16:03,600
That's why it says in the Repertory you will
 see throwing things, Staph. capital.

93
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:17,619
When the anger is so much she has to take
 this and just throw it; but with a difference.

94
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,869
 I have seen a few acute insanity cases with Staph. They are all expressing this, throw the plates, throw the vase

95
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:40,909
 just throw things as if she wants to take all
the anger out what it has been left inside.

96
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:51,959
 She wants to take it out by throwing things. Still on this condition you will see a kind of sweetness

97
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:58,939
you will not see violence. It's very
interesting, you will not see violence.

98
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:09,459
I remember one man, I have seen in America, who was the most violent Staph.

99
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:22,899
He said, 'I drive with my car and
somebody does some unjust to me...

100
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:35,869
...he doesn't allow me to pass and things like that and then the other guy opens the window and throws an insult to him.

101
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:54,829
And he says, 'I go home and I'm trembling and I want to hit my head on the wall. Stupid, why didn't you also insult him?

102
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:59,679
Why didn't you get out of the car and just go and kill him?'

103
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:11,489
But he cannot do it, he just thinks about it but he cannot do it. When I gave Staph. to this man, he says Stram., Hyos.

104
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:15,630
I say, no, no.

105
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:28,039
Hyos. when he wants to kill, he means it. 'I want to kill', it is another feeling all together.

106
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:33,919
You get the coldness in the eyes, you don't get communication.

107
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:46,359
 You get something but this belongs to the area of deep observation of very sensitive observation of course.

108
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:59,359
But in Hyos. you get in the eyes a feeling that she can really do it. She can kill at a certain moment, it's a coldness.

109
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:14,879
Staph. because it's expressing the anger, he describes different incidents where he wanted to.... but it was impossible.

110
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:26,969
He would go back home and hit his head on the wall saying you are so coward, you are so stupid. Gels., give me Gels. No, no.

111
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:39,389
The idea of I want to express anger and I cannot. And I want to throw things, I cannot. I want to kill, I cannot.

112
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:55,709
You have a constitutional Staph. that means the child is born Staph. a Staph. child that will not be able to express anger

113
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:04,449
but at the same time having that vulnerability. Feeling inside that sensitivity. The child is growing

114
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:14,969
 and is protected by the mother especially. They create a good environment for the child Staph.

115
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:31,289
The child Staph. will develop most probably into a kind of...he cannot become a man.

116
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:48,339
You see a man is connected with the idea of conqueror. You want to conquer, you want to be the power.

117
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:57,319
Staph. is lacking that. It is rather giving because it has a lot of sensitive emotions.

118
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:12,509
So if the child is born like this, it has a problem
 in having a relationship with somebody else.

119
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:27,499
A boy who is very sensitive, very shy, who looks, who observes, he knows, he feels but at the same time he feels he can be hurt.

120
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:33,259
If he tells me that, what shall  I say?

121
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:53,739
In Staph. the feelings are alive, also the sexual sphere is alive but they lack the power to express outside.

122
00:21:55,150 --> 00:22:18,449
That is why you will see usually in men that desire for sex. The desire is alive, what is he going to do?

123
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:23,570
He is going to resort to masturbation.

124
00:22:23,571 --> 00:22:35,109
Because he cannot have the normal sexual relationship.

125
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:46,459
Not all men will be like that, not at all but I say it might be the case.

126
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:57,919
I once treated a case a man of 38 years old and he had never had any relationship.

127
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:04,999
But he was masturbating since the age of 10,11 something like that.

128
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:16,049
He did not have homosexual tendencies or relations.

129
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:27,719
He got into the habit of masturbation and he was not able to communicate with the other sex.

130
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:39,619
You see the woman wants to feel that the man is  stronger, she can rely. Staph. is not stronger.

131
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:47,839
Staph. is the person who supports with the feeling the husband. That's why the husbands who have Staph. wives

132
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,589
they say, my wife is the best.

133
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:59,359
Because they go at home and they do whatever they like. Always the woman is there, available.

134
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:09,399
With all her feelings, with all her love. You insult her, 5 min., 15 min. she forgets it, again the feelings come.

135
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:20,919
In the night you want to have sex. OK have sex. It goes like this until all that builds up and one day she says, 'I had enough'.

136
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:28,199
But by herself actually is very difficult
 that Staph. will say 'I had enough'.

137
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:43,599
That means she got out of the Staph. situation  and then even if she does this, from time to time actually

138
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:52,519
 if you ask Staph. they say, yes from time to time I break out my anger quite violently.

139
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:58,529
I may throw things and do all kind of things but then it passes away.

140
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:02,239
Under the remedy, this does not go away.

141
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:14,019
The organism is lifted and the person understands that this makes me sick, I don't want it.

142
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:22,849
And that's why she goes into extremes like divorce sometimes.

143
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:36,759
In the Repertory it is expressed all that in words. But actually what you have to understand is the structure of the individual.

144
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:46,679
Feelings alive, anger is there, cannot be expressed but the feelings are alive, the sexual sphere is alive

145
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:56,579
 very alive but difficult to bring it out.

146
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:07,999
It's typical when you examine a Staph. you give an example where she has to suppress her anger

147
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:17,619
and the most common is when you sit on a queue and there are a lot of people in front and you wait for half an hour there.

148
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:24,600
And somebody tries to get there.
The Nux-v. says, 'Mr. go back'.

149
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:30,079
Staph. never will be able to say one word.

150
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:38,319
She can sit there and observe that, the anger is there but forget it. No way you can make her say

151
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:44,069
'please why don't you go back?'
 Even that she cannot.

152
00:26:49,560 --> 00:27:01,159
You go with Tarentula, he will
grab him and just throw him back.

153
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:17,899
These ideas will give the right remedy, the in depth remedy.

154
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:30,849
You say styes a lot of styes this is a hint
 for investigating the possibility of Staph.

155
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:39,239
If every time you see styes you give Staph. sometimes will be correct but this is not enough to understand.

156
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:47,579
And we have enough information today for Staph. to understand in depth what is going on.

157
00:27:47,580 --> 00:28:02,979
And then we see the acute Staph. situation where she is going mad. She has an acute insanity

158
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:16,719
and then she will swear, she will say bad words and she will throw things.

159
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:22,609
She will get up in the morning and the husband suddenly sees the whole kitchen is down.

160
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:36,969
She is gone out, finished. Call the doctor. And then she tells different things expressing anger.

161
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:49,229
One of the doctors of the center, it was a Sunday evening, she managed to put the patient into her car

162
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:52,199
and brought the patient in my home.

163
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:59,959
She was in a terrible state. She would say this, she would say that, she would express.

164
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:15,259
She was mostly angry with her mother in law. Her mother in law had suppressed her too much

165
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:19,479
and until she was lead to insanity.

166
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:31,399
So this insanity case she was doing all that, she was so angry. You know the doctor did not know what to do.

167
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:45,599
 I noticed that she was so sweet, doing
all that but sweetness was coming out.

168
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:53,250
While the action was violent, the words were violent, the eyes were producing sweetness.

169
00:29:53,251 --> 00:29:57,159
 You don't understand that but this is Staph.

170
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,270
You see anger can be killing.

171
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:16,120
You see anger with viciousness.

172
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:24,929
Nux-v., Aur., Lil-t., they are vicious in their anger.

173
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:34,439
With Staph.  no. It's anger but not vicious. You understand vicious?

174
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:43,599
Tell me another word for vicious. Malicious.

175
00:30:47,840 --> 00:31:06,879
It's very interesting that in Staph. these cutting words of whoever is connected with, it is like cutting the soul

176
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,199
and leaving a mark in the soul.

177
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:22,039
The same thing that you see in the physical body a sharp instrument like the surgeon cuts the physical body

178
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:26,399
 and then there it remains the pain.

179
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:38,529
The organism cannot get rid of that pain and we have after surgery pain that remains for very long time is treated.

180
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:47,280
You see injuries from sharp object. It's the same idea actually.

181
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,180
There is another characteristic of Staph.

182
00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:10,239
 We said she is full of feelings, she is full of sexual desire, energy but Staph. usually do not have

183
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:19,489
especially women, a lot of affairs. Therefore the woman may be just marry the man who has met, the first man

184
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:24,719
who met and they are married and then they try to have sex.

185
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:32,979
Now what happens with Staph.  There is an over excitement.

186
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:47,679
It means a lot of blood supply into the area where this becomes very sensitive.

187
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:57,439
And with the excitement and this and sexual intercourse immediately after you will have this cystitis

188
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:03,629
which begins from the first intercourse or
after intercourse. It is not after intercourse.

189
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:14,999
 It's when the excitement is too much and after the excitement in Staph. it's not a matter of being infected.

190
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:25,484
It's a matter of over supply of blood. That means the organs becomes very stimulated and then the cystitis starts.

191
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:36,489
Where the same thing if it happens because of the husband, the woman is not over stimulated and then it's Med.

192
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:51,869
That means you need Med. It means that the husband has been infected and in continuation infects the woman

193
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:59,359
and then she starts with cystitis, after a few days.

194
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:17,469
Usually with a layer of Med. in a woman you can see that she has been infected during her marriage

195
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:24,519
and because of the infection she starts having cystitis, another cystitis, another cystitis.

196
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,899
Then eventually she comes to you.

197
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:50,379
 This belongs to group 2 where you give a remedy and jumps to group 1 and then cystitis ceases.

198
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:55,739
Then she may have a cystitis once the year, once every two years.

199
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:07,300
This is the type that she can be infected by gonorrhea.

200
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:14,959
Lower lever 3 and 4 cannot be infected by gonorrhea.

201
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:22,439
If you are in that level, you can have free sex. Don't protect.

202
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:27,759
I don't advice you that but anyhow you understand I hope.

203
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:42,349
Also in Staph. children we see an over excitement, we observe early masturbation and we observe

204
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:49,400
only sometimes the teeth turn black.

205
00:35:52,240 --> 00:36:02,649
You see a child and a lot of teeth are becoming black in the base of the dentine.

206
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:08,279
 There are discolorations which they look black.

207
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:12,320
Dwells on sexual matters.

208
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:21,819
 Do you know what it means that? I will tell you.

209
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:41,319
It means that, for instance, a man goes to bed to sleep. He is not married and fantasizes a lot of sexual activities.

210
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:45,559
And then eventually he goes to sleep.

211
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:57,059
Either he goes to sleep or to masturbation or whatever. The idea is that sex occupies a lot. It's very strong element

212
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:02,935
with this remedy, it occupies a lot on the thoughts of the person. So it lies down and likes to fantasize

213
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:19,209
sexual matters which are not violent sex. It is
 not so much sexual, it's more romantic sex.

214
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:32,969
Why? The sensitivity of Staph. requires that element of tenderness. You treat Staph. with tenderness

215
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:38,679
 with kindness, with respect and she will give you everything.

216
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:52,799
She has no resistance but start hurting her, she closes, closes and then finally the explosion comes.

217
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:11,792
Something else we have to say about Staph. which is again characteristic and in most of the cases you will see it.

218
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:17,469
It's a very strong keynote.

219
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:29,079
When they sleep in the night time and they wake up in the morning, it's very good but if they try to sleep in the afternoon

220
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:41,279
and especially if they stay for more than half an hour asleep, one hour in the afternoon, they get up and they cannot.

221
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:48,359
They feel so rotten from afternoon sleep.

222
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:56,800
They say, 'if I sleep 5 minutes it's OK but if I sleep more than half an hour I can't get up, can't wake.'

223
00:38:57,001 --> 00:39:03,330
 They sleep deep and the sleep is not refreshing.

224
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:12,169
-I wanted to ask about the sexual dwelling. I understand that Staph. cannot be someone who would rape

225
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:18,220
 because he is too tender. He cannot do it by force.

226
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:30,470
Is there any situation that if a woman accepts him and wants him, he cannot resist?

227
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:46,979
Anything like showing of love or acceptance from woman he would not be able to resist her invitation?

228
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:51,209
Is it something which might be typical for Staph.

229
00:39:53,420 --> 00:40:06,399
-What we have to understand also is that Staph. has an element of femininity, not homosexuality.

230
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:12,559
He can be homosexual, he can go to that direction but it's femininity.

231
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:24,639
Therefore a man who has femininity is not aggressive and usually is the woman who takes the first initiative to invite.

232
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:35,239
And Staph. can respond very nicely but as long as will feel secure.

233
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:47,239
Why the Staph.  don't make easy love affairs? They are not the type of people they will run away.

234
00:40:47,240 --> 00:41:00,259
Who are that type? Med., Tarent., Nux-v., Lyc., yes. Staph. no. She is too sensitive to do that.

235
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:13,079
So if a man is invited, then he has to feel secure to go ahead. Otherwise resist.

236
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:21,039
-When Staph. sleeps in the afternoon they don't feel good the whole evening or for an hour ?

237
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:30,279
-They are not feeling well for an hour, not
 for the whole evening. The most one hour.

238
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:40,695
There are a lot of other remedies which are doing that. Oversleeping and then not feeling well.

239
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:54,089
Nat-s., Sulph. etc. but this has to say, after sleep I avoid it because I feel terrible if I go into a nap in the afternoon.

240
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:11,959
-I got a bit confused. You start telling that people with little change in the face you will not notice, only very little change.

241
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,868
What picture is this?

242
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:25,809
-No, no. I said in order to understand somebody you have to love them, you have to care about them and

243
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:31,289
if you love and care, you will notice even little changes.

244
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:43,619
I said how you communicate. You communicate by loving, by feeling things. Staph. has feelings, therefore

245
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:47,209
you communicate, therefore you feel good.

246
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:57,196
Otherwise as a doctor you can feel isolated and tired. Not with Staph.

247
00:42:57,570 --> 00:43:00,919
-What picture is this when you feel
isolated? Is this Nat-m.?

248
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:04,799
-This can be Nat-m., it can be Ign., closed remedies.

249
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:23,319
But in the Repertory it says ailments from grief, Staph. is capital, silent grief, Staph. is there.

250
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:33,880
But the feeling you get is different.

251
00:43:33,881 --> 00:43:46,999
 You don't get the feeling of isolation, you feel good. That is a sign that the person  is open in his emotions

252
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:54,399
 and this you don't go to the wrong remedies.

253
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:06,839
Also I said that in order to understand a person who is sitting in front of you, you have to keep your feelings

254
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:21,919
open but that does not mean you have a love affair because then you cannot cure the person.

255
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:30,839
Because you don't see objectively anymore and that's finished. You send this patient to your colleague

256
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:39,079
you do whatever you like, forget about treating this person because you love him/her.

257
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,240
You don't see objectively anymore.

258
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:56,143
 So you have to have open feelings but at the same time not get attached. Difficult.

259
00:44:56,340 --> 00:45:02,569
Especially when there is communication. The patient has open feelings, you have open feelings

260
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:07,319
and then there is communication. You have to learn to withdraw.

261
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:17,069
I learn as much I want, thank you, not anymore, I don't want to hear. We don't' want to hear stories, we want to find the remedy.

262
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:26,159
We are not interested because if you are so much attracted to somebody, you want to know everything.

263
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:32,119
That is not Homeopathy. Homeopathy is to get enough information to get down to the picture.

264
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:38,959
You get the remedy, finished the interview. Otherwise it is dangerous, I'm telling you.

265
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:51,249
When I develop the case it is all this
that I said is perceived in a flash.

266
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:57,228
 You get the feeling, maybe Staph.
You may ask one question.

267
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:04,989
How do you feel after afternoon sleep? You get immediately answer, I can't have it.

268
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:13,159
That's all you need, finished. Never mind the affairs and not affairs and things like that. That you are not interested.

269
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:18,639
We are not curing people because of the placebo effect. That means because we are nice.

270
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:28,639
When we talk like that and somebody is listening to us, they say you are so analytical but the moment you sit down

271
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:32,419
with the patient, you are not analytical, you are just an observer. But you are open observer.

272
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:42,489
 The patient does not know what you are looking for. So the patient he may even go angry out

273
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:51,265
A Nat-m. she will go out of the consultation feeling totally bad, especially if she has said a little bit about her own state.

274
00:46:57,810 --> 00:47:02,909
 Confessing, saying what she is feeling.

275
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:10,719
She says goes out of the consultation and
 says, 'I was ridiculous, I almost cried'

276
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:15,559
And then they start feeling bad.
 They go to sleep and they cannot sleep.

277
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:23,619
Because they had a bad consultation. What was bad in consultation? She spoke about certain things which are a bit deeper.

278
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:28,779
So we don't have the placebo effect. It's all nonsense.

279
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:40,859
We have the placebo effect but
not as curing but as an amelioration.

280
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:50,839
In the center in Athens what I had noticed,
 they were 30 doctors working.

281
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:58,349
2 of them they did not attend the classes,
 they don't know Homeopathy.

282
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:05,929
So they pass all the cases to somebody
else or they prescribe wrongly.

283
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:13,159
But they are the doctors who have the most clients, no client will leave them.

284
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:21,649
So you get finally the case, after a year nothing has happened and you prescribe, finally you find the remedy.

285
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:25,720
But in the meantime, one year the patient comes why?

286
00:48:25,721 --> 00:48:32,909
Because they have the knack to behave well with the patient.

287
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:38,479
They are nice with people, this is the placebo effect but the patient is not cured.

288
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:49,959
He says, maybe in this I'm better and they talk and they get out and their inside.

289
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:59,150
If you talk and if somebody is interested, yes you are going to have a rapport and if you are open

290
00:48:59,151 --> 00:49:01,839
 you are going to keep your patients.

291
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:10,319
Even if they are not getting better. But then you know that this is a placebo effect. You give the remedy

292
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:17,519
and he comes back and says, a little bit this and that, I'm better and then they continue.

293
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:26,759
Never mind what you give, they are better. But not really. In the end, when you take the sum results

294
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:33,089
 of your treatment, you see nothing.
That means he never got the right remedy.

295
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:47,489
-Do you mean that all the things we say to our patients is a placebo ? When I talk to a patient, I think our voice

296
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:59,309
has a tone and a frequency like the homeopathic remedies. As the color has, I don't see it as a placebo.

297
00:49:59,310 --> 00:50:10,639
-When you talk nicely and you are behaving nicely and the person is satisfied after the consultation

298
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:16,748
is a psychological interaction.
This is what they do in psychotherapy.

299
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:27,369
In psychotherapy, they claim they have results...

300
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:38,319
...and I have patients 10,15 years in psychotherapy being exactly the same as when they started.

301
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:44,559
The difference is that they depend on that conversation with the psychiatrist.

302
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:55,639
And if they visit every week or every 10 days or they telephone, I feel that, they explain.

303
00:50:57,660 --> 00:51:07,639
Now in America for instance they find all kinds of insight things which have happened in the past, mother, father.

304
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,760
They interfere with everything.

305
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:28,519
Your father died and you were in excursion and you didn't see him dying, that has remained for the rest of your life

306
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:35,039
and that's why you have this guilt feelings.

307
00:51:37,870 --> 00:51:46,279
And I said, OK now you know that, the guilt feelings they go away. Why they don't go away?

308
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:55,279
The psychiatrist told me, he found out that it is because I didn't see my father that I have these guilt feelings.

309
00:51:56,070 --> 00:52:04,029
Very good, now you know let's see what happens. Nothing. It's the same.

310
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:12,029
The anxiety is the same, the guilt feelings are the same. And then they find another excuse.

311
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:19,599
After you go on with these feelings of not seeing the father the moment he died, then they find another one.

312
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:28,080
Because your mother did not give you enough whatever....

313
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:38,039
 ...and they say all this useless talking
 but necessary because people are suffering and
they have

314
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:45,289
 to have some kind of release.
This is one type of release, communicating.

315
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:53,439
 If you have a good relationship in your life with a man or a woman do you need a psychiatrist?

316
00:52:56,530 --> 00:53:03,159
Why do you need the psychiatrist. You have your woman, you say I'm terribly upset today

317
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:12,359
because this has happened and the woman understands, she suffers with you, then it's finished, it's over.

318
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:19,439
Then you don't need to go to the psychiatrist. Or if you don't have a good relationship, the woman comes

319
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:24,710
'every time you come home you bring all your problems, I don't want your problems at home'.

320
00:53:24,711 --> 00:53:28,169
Then you need a psychiatrist.

321
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:32,409
 Of course because you can't express anything in the house.

322
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:41,119
I will get a psychiatrist and go and tell I was so upset etc. The psychiatrist will say 'yes I understand you'.

323
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:48,389
Sometimes they sleep. By the time they talk, the psychiatrist sleeps, it doesn't matter, as long as the patient talks.

324
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:57,439
That's the idea. You have seen the films, you have seen psychiatrists sitting on the back and sleeping, and snoring.

325
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:14,969
But it is necessary because he cannot have
 a natural outlet in the proper situation.

326
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:22,989
When I resist my anger, this anger is going to go inside and kill me. This is the idea with Staph.

327
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:31,199
It's going to go inside and kill her. What it does? What are the pathologies which Staph. develop?

328
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:47,009
One of the pathology it can be affecting the nervous system and producing chorea.

329
00:54:53,240 --> 00:55:00,329
Chorea in children which have been reprimanded and they cannot take it, they are sensitive.

330
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:08,639
And the first time the father shouted so much and then they start with the chorea movements.

331
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:19,569
And so therefore Staph. becomes for pathology one of the main remedies in chorea in children.

332
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:30,119
Also it's one of the main remedies in psoriasis in children, especially when the psoriasis is generalized.

333
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:46,409
If the child is sensitive and they don't cry easily, they will keep inside and then psoriasis comes out.

334
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:54,879
And this psoriasis can stay for many many years of course and then it comes as grown ups.

335
00:55:57,310 --> 00:56:06,039
I like also to hear when we lecture and we have an experience or a case, I would like to hear and the class would like to hear

336
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:14,519
instead of me telling because I may be telling whatever I like, I like to hear from you, your own experience concerning this remedy.

337
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:25,789
And I had a cases like this, I'm interested, I'm learning also. I'm open to learning all the time.

338
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:37,279
I don't say 'now that's it', no. I see something else one time, I keep it. I see it again, something is going on.

339
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:47,999
And then this becomes knowledge. Then you apply the new information, then it works, then it becomes knowledge.

340
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:57,489
That is how Homeopathy can develop really. And develop realistically, not by imagining things.

341
00:57:03,570 --> 00:57:10,039
You were in the orphanage? You need Tuberculinum.

342
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:22,559
That was told to me and I said, what is this because you are an orphan? Yes. Who said that? I tried to trace this

343
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:30,409
 and then they say, this person who
heard it from you. I say, forget it.

344
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:48,389
This is becoming projecting and distorting the information and finally reaching the information in totally different manner.

345
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:55,879
At the same time you have to have the sexual excitement. That means going in the night, fantasizing all the time

346
00:57:55,880 --> 00:58:03,359
and ending up most of the time in masturbation. And what is happening with Staph. also?

347
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:11,469
  It's not that he or she goes to masturbation and feels good, no.

348
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:22,439
They feel bad because they are sensitive. What am I doing? They feel it's not right but they do it next day

349
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:25,719
and it's not right and they suffer because of this.

350
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:32,139
In the same way they suffer after sexual intercourse.

351
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:55,119
I remember one case he said, I feel bad for 4 days, exhausted, low energy, depression for 4 days.

352
00:58:56,510 --> 00:59:07,559
And it was a man, actually he was a black man in America, a doctor who said, I have a problem because

353
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:13,279
I need more but I cannot do it because of the after effect.

354
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:25,009
The after effect, that means releasing the sexual energy does not give satisfaction but a dissatisfaction.

355
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:38,509
-I had a case of a 40 years old woman who had desire to become pregnant, who after many years of marriage

356
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:45,419
and going to hospitals and fertility clinics was unsuccessful in bearing children.

357
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:54,699
At first I had given Nat-m. and within few weeks she became pregnant but there was a spontaneous abortion

358
00:59:54,700 --> 01:00:00,700
and again I repeated the Nat-m. Again she became pregnant and a spontaneous abortion.

359
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:13,609
 Finally I asked her because she was very lovely, very sophisticated, quiet, delightful person very demure

360
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:21,499
 in her disposition and I said, 'how badly you want this child?' She says, 'I wanted this child all my life.'

361
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:27,729
 I said, 'how would you raise your child?' She said, 'I would raise this child with all the love and affection that

362
01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:32,959
 every woman on the planet could give'. 'And how would your husband would raise the child?'

363
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:37,329
 She said, 'I would never let that son of the bitch touch her'.

364
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:48,339
So many red flags went up and finally it came to pass that she finally acknowledged that she had been in abusive

365
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:57,339
 relationship physically and emotionally for the last 12 years with her husband. And I gave her Staph. 10M

366
01:00:57,340 --> 01:01:05,939
and within 4 months she was divorced. She was remarried within 6 months and then proceeded to have 3 children

367
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:08,919
 without any additional remedy.

368
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:20,759
-This aggravation after coition goes also in women?

369
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:25,390
-Also in women yes.

370
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:35,319
 They desire very much , the desire is there but the after effect is bad and it's bad physically

371
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:38,619
on the physical body but emotionally also.

372
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:48,110
The masturbation leaves not so much physical problems as much as psychological problems.

373
01:01:48,111 --> 01:01:56,349
-I want to relate an experience with Staph. I had a man about 40 years old, he had terrible headache.

374
01:01:56,350 --> 01:02:02,679
And what brought me to Staph. because he was an engineer, he didn't have any children, his wife was at home

375
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:13,759
all the time and he came in the evening, did the laundry. So I gave him Staph. and a week later the wife called and said

376
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:19,789
 'what did you do with my husband? I had such a nice husband'. I said 'how's the headache?'

377
01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:25,640
'The headache is better but he doesn't want to put the laundry anymore'.

378
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:46,009
-I want to stress also that we're describing here as Staph. is on group 1 level. We're describing the Staph.

379
01:02:46,010 --> 01:02:49,509
 here and we give the full picture.

380
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:57,479
You will ask me, you won't find Staph. in group 4? You will find but not as a full picture.

381
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:02,329
As you go down, the picture becomes smaller and smaller.

382
01:03:02,330 --> 01:03:10,400
So here maybe the Staph. is there but the effect is not going to be clear, it's going to be mixed with other remedies.

383
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:17,479
You give the remedy, it clears up a little bit the ground, it has some effect but not the effect that you are describing

384
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:22,380
  here in these cases where you give the Staph. and they divorce etc.

385
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:31,279
Don't expect this to happen in these cases, when you have the deep pathology here.

386
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:36,850
You just have a little bit of an effect
and then you proceed for the next remedy.

387
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:48,479
-I have 2 questions concerning Staph. One is I used to be a lawyer and from my practice as a lawyer

388
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:54,509
 I can remember that I met several women
 who were in very difficult relationships. They were beaten

389
01:03:54,510 --> 01:04:02,448
 by the husbands and I really got engaged for them and made sure that they can keep the apartment and so on.

390
01:04:02,850 --> 01:04:11,369
Very often then I experienced that either they make peace again with the same man they had beaten them before

391
01:04:11,370 --> 01:04:19,639
or they ended the relationship, got a divorce and then started the next relationship with a very similar type of man again.

392
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:22,959
-That's correct.

393
01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:30,680
Yes this can be done by Staph. women.

394
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:40,919
What you are describing can be done by a Staph. woman. This is the psychology.

395
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:44,519
-It is masochistic a little bit.

396
01:04:45,970 --> 01:04:58,359
-Well not exactly because masochism is different where you like to be hit. You like pain. Staph. does not like pain.

397
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:07,519
It takes it inside, the anger raises but this is up to here and then it doesn't come out. The anger is there.

398
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:19,759
You hit me. It's the pain and you feel if you are sensitive at all, you see it immediately in the feelings of the woman.

399
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:30,509
You brought pain! But she doesn't say, you brought pain, you hit me. You just see a little change on her face.

400
01:05:31,090 --> 01:05:36,699
And she just turns around and leaves.
It's totally different.

401
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:46,769
You hit Tarentula or Nux-v., Graph.,
 and you will see what happens.

402
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:57,681
-The second question is Staph. is the main remedy in the rubric 'cannot tolerate injustice'. So it's a main remedy

403
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:05,119
 if you have a case you ask a patient who cannot tolerate injustice, you will always think of Caust.

404
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:12,329
Why do we not think at first Staph.

405
01:06:17,850 --> 01:06:27,439
-The 'cannot tolerate injustice', first of all is a natural feeling. Everyone cannot tolerate.

406
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:37,989
What we say here as pathology it means
little injustice brings tremendous reaction.

407
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:44,009
This is pathology. Then they say, you are crazy. Why you do like this?

408
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:57,019
They have described to me, for instance, a Caust. they see in the street a man who goes with his donkey

409
01:06:57,020 --> 01:07:05,319
and the donkey knows that it's going to get one in the back. And the man just hits it in the back  and the donkey

410
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:13,919
 speeds up and Caust. sees that and wants to jump on this man who hit the donkey, and hit him.

411
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:24,729
   This is over reaction. It is not an injustice, simply injustice which everyone has.

412
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:39,279
There are injustices which are made in the world. For instance the Turks are doing a lot of injustice to the Kurds.

413
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:47,599
They are the power, they go there and they hit them. We all hear it, we say poor men, we don't do anything.

414
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:52,599
A Causticum will think what can I do?

415
01:07:53,560 --> 01:08:05,239
Thinks, thinks, sees the injustice and then he prepares to make a bomb and kill the Prime Minister of Turkey.

416
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:15,447
He will have to do that. Somebody says, you are crazy, they will catch you, they will kill you. He cannot resist.

417
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:23,349
That's Caust. Staph. is different in injustice.

418
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:30,999
Cannot tolerate injustice means, I take it inside and I suffer and I don't say anything.

419
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:41,340
So both you can say they cannot tolerate injustice but the one is revolutionary...

420
01:08:41,341 --> 01:08:48,119
... he wants really to throw a bomb, he is revolutionary.

421
01:08:48,120 --> 01:09:00,055
The other one will suffer inside because he cannot express, he cannot say, you have been unjust to me.

422
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:04,279
You give Staph. and then she will say it.

423
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:17,999
-I just wanted to tell you about a case I had many years ago and I didn't know very much about Homeopathy.

424
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:26,289
It was a lady that had really bad back. She couldn't sit down, she couldn't lie, she couldn't move at all.

425
01:09:26,290 --> 01:09:36,359
So I gave her Bry. and she got a little bit better. And then she came back and we were working on it

426
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:45,687
and suddenly one day she had this terrible back pain and I asked her if something had happened.

427
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:59,799
She said, she had a discussion with her boss at work. So I thought about Staph. I asked her if she could tell him off

428
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:05,729
and she said, 'no I could never do that'.
So I gave her Staph. and the pain was gone.

429
01:10:05,730 --> 01:10:20,759
 Then after quite half a year she telephoned me and she said, 'I've been in bed for 3 days with a terrible backache'.

430
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:35,839
I said why? She said I've been watching a movie on the television about some boys that were abused.

431
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:47,439
I said why did that come so strong to you? And she said, you know it was just what my father did to me

432
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:55,919
 when I was a young girl. And I didn't know before and I gave her Staph. again and it was gone.

433
01:10:57,530 --> 01:11:08,939
-How do we differentiate in chorea in children who have been reprimanded between Staph. and Agar.?

434
01:11:12,590 --> 01:11:26,799
-The Agar. will have more little muscles twitching. The Agar. also will have a different type, as we described.

435
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:41,400
The Agar. is somebody who is weak willed and anxious to the extreme.

436
01:11:41,401 --> 01:11:49,219
 You will have several points in which you may be differentiating...

437
01:11:49,220 --> 01:11:57,579
...and the Staph. will not be prescribed on the movements. It will be prescribed on the type of the person.

438
01:12:01,470 --> 01:12:11,689
 Pall. also will have similar situations from reprimand.

439
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:21,369
But in the Pall. the main issue that you will see is he is not recognized. He does not get the recognition he needs.

440
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:25,039
They don't tell him, 'you are a good boy'.

441
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:36,800
They need to be told every time, every day, if it's possible, 'you are a very good boy'. It is like Puls.

442
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:42,509
 It's a craving for recognition.

443
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:56,080
Not consolation. Puls. is similar, recognition. 'You are a good student. You are a good doctor'. This is not consolation.
