1
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:42,225
In Theory you will be judged more than the Materia Medica.

2
00:00:42,325 --> 00:00:48,769
All this you can find easily in the Repertory. You just turn the Repertory and you find it.

3
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:59,779
In Theory you saw what happened. He does not know the Theory, spoiled the case, now she is suffering. She would be a happy girl.

4
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:12,749
Though he knows Materia Medica. What he does not know, Theory.

5
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:22,479
And I have seen that many many good homeopaths, my students, spoiled their cases. Why?

6
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:28,999
Because they have not attended a full course, they don't know everything. That's why I say, ask questions

7
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:38,599
and make sure you understand a theoretical point. This is very important for me to feel secure that you are going

8
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:47,069
to be good in the future. In the future you will be learning Materia Medica every day, by feedback.

9
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:52,149
Theory you will never know unless you get it all in your mind.

10
00:01:52,150 --> 00:02:06,679
Do I lecture from paper in Theory? Everything is a concrete thing and that has to be transferred in you.

11
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:13,329
So you are secure with this knowledge.

12
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:33,940
This remedy is a remedy who is weak in general. Weak in physical.

13
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,159
Also they try to avoid any kind of aggression.

14
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:58,669
If two people fight in a room, Mag-m. will try to pacify, 'please, please, don't fight'. They cannot stand the aggression.

15
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:14,029
Somebody else can enjoy. Tarentula. He will come and hit one or the other. It depends how is each remedy.

16
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:23,264
Lycopodium will run away. People react differently.

17
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:33,039
This will try to pacify. 'Please don't fight'. And there is also another characteristic thing with this remedy

18
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,259
that they feel they are getting old.

19
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:49,779
Never mind what age, 30, 35. 'I feel I'm getting old'. It's the weakness, this feeling, the liver is not working properly.

20
00:03:49,950 --> 00:04:02,520
The digestion is not good and it takes the turn. Liver affection, hepatitis, jaundice.

21
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:16,839
There is another characteristic which is they're restless and anxiety or lying down and closing eyes.

22
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,879
He has to get up and walk.

23
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:34,859
You can imagine especially when the respiratory system is affected, there is a blockage in the nose and they cannot breathe.

24
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:41,730
They become very restless and they have to get up and walk.

25
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,639
The moment they lie down is very strange.

26
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:53,569
They lie down; the anxiety and the restlessness comes. And they have to get up and walk.

27
00:04:53,570 --> 00:05:02,590
They walk, they calm down, they go and lie down, after a while again, anxiety and restlessness.

28
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:18,169
Unrefreshing sleep as we said in, diarrhea from milk, which is the same with Mag-c. Aversion to milk

29
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:24,009
and diarrhea from milk. Regular headache crisis with vomiting and thirst.

30
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:32,499
What do we mean by that? Regular headache crisis with vomiting and thirst?

31
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:44,799
This is a severe syndrome which this remedy has concerning headaches, which comes in batches. For instance for 2 months

32
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:55,579
the headaches come every 5,10 days. Every 10 days, severe headache which totally exhausts them.

33
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:14,960
They go to bed and they have to vomit 1-2 times and then it calms down. But during the headache it develops strong thirst.

34
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:30,829
 This is very important for this remedy.

35
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:48,559
All the remedies actually which have the muriatic element are aggravated in the sea. Mur-ac., Nat-m., Mag-m.

36
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:25,779
Also infancy constipation during dentition. It's very strange that during dentition Cham. will do all this kind of things

37
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:34,440
which we know Cham. children are doing and these children develop constipation.

38
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,850
Who else cannot digest milk?

39
00:07:43,560 --> 00:08:00,064
There is another remedy which is Aethusa which cannot digest milk and vomits the milk. This has diarrhea from milk.

40
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:14,319
Aethusa has vomiting in pieces, from milk. It becomes sour, like sour milk and then it comes out.

41
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:45,719
Med. is a very frequently indicated remedy in Greece.

42
00:08:49,940 --> 00:09:06,709
I don't know in other countries but here is quite frequent. I have not seen it so much in other European countries.

43
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:21,019
They  are passionate people, passion for everything. Whatever they do, they do it with passion.

44
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:37,959
They breed animals, they have passion, they love them, they breed flowers. They do it with passion. They have boats,

45
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:50,699
fishing, it's a hobby for Med. They feel very well because they are in the sea and they are calm and fishing is very good.

46
00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:06,439
The amelioration by the sea is not amelioration, I see the sea from here and I see it's beautiful. Not this.

47
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:16,209
The amelioration has to be when they go inside the sea and they have a headache, they have a pain, they have a colic

48
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:23,170
 they go out of the sea and the pains are gone. This is amelioration from the sea.

49
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:32,679
Because there is nobody who does not like the sea. Who does not like to see the sea beautiful?

50
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,419
Then it's the opposite, then maybe he is sick.

51
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:52,289
Amelioration by the sea is with children with asthma for instance, they are suffering a lot, they come down to the sea

52
00:10:52,290 --> 00:11:04,619
 and the asthma disappears within 1,2 days. It's like strong medication. Children who have to take bronchodilators

53
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:13,839
 to exist, Med. children, they can go to the sea and they feel totally cured.

54
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:26,519
That is amelioration from the sea and then we have the night people who are better in the evening.

55
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:43,229
We see it with students who cannot study during the day. During the day they are restless, they waste their time

56
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:53,219
and the evening comes and the mind is more clear, there is more energy more concentrated and they can work until

57
00:11:53,220 --> 00:12:05,119
 3, 4 o'clock in the morning. This is a remedy which is ameliorated from the sunset to 3 o'clock in the morning.

58
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:18,010
 If somebody is ameliorated from 12 onwards  then it is Lycopodium.

59
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:37,079
You will mix this remedy with Lyc. because Lyc. feels better after 8, 9 o'clock, they start feeling better.

60
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:44,589
 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock better but from 12 o'clock onwards they say I feel much better.

61
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:55,519
And they can work at 1,2,3. The same with Med. Students work, the homework they do, everything they do

62
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:01,869
in the night and they have an effect in the night.

63
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:09,629
If they sit down to work during the day, forget it. There is no effect.

64
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:30,879
See also the desires, the combination of salt, fat, ice cubes, sour fruit, oranges, unripe green fruits, sweet alcoholic drinks.

65
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,800
They can have this combination of desires.

66
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:48,119
 If the sour fruit is missing, the unripe green fruit is missing, you start doubting.

67
00:13:50,440 --> 00:14:05,949
People who like the fruits, green because it's sour, this is the best they say, that is a Med. case and also it is another remedy

68
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:15,770
which we spoke about, having desire Calc-s.

69
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:24,020
About 2% of the class remembers.

70
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:54,289
Med.  in their sexual life are oversexed, they like sex, they enjoy sex but their relationships are lasting as long as the passion lasts.

71
00:14:54,290 --> 00:15:01,209
Then they are bored. They lose interest but this can last 3, 4 years.

72
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:14,159
How long a passion can last? Not more. According to statistics no more than 3 years.

73
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:22,119
 Med. is a remedy that will keep up relationship with passion, the longest.

74
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:37,369
It may reach up to 4 years, 5 years together with Lach. Lach. also has that. Plat., on the other hand

75
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:44,749
while it's so sexual and wants sex all the time, the passion does not last, it has to change.

76
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:59,999
So these people are passionate people with a lot of emotions, they are extroverts and sometimes you have the opposite type

77
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:09,919
where you have a very introvert person who is not able to express anything, to say anything, to go out. They cannot go out

78
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:25,370
they cannot express, they are very introvert. And they have to drink alcohol before go out and buy something from the store.

79
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:37,599
Mostly they like sweet alcoholic drinks.

80
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:50,350
You know this 'liqueur' ? Who likes liqueur?

81
00:16:50,351 --> 00:17:12,920
Liqueur because it's sweet it's liked by many people but it has to be really a desire.

82
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:31,330
These people cannot become easily alcoholics.

83
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:46,430
Because they are interested in sex so much that all the excitement and the energy goes there. They don't need to drink.

84
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:58,399
Shakespeare says the wine brings the desire but takes away the result.

85
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:11,929
Med's know that very well and they like to be sober when they have to do this kind of business.

86
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:33,639
What is interesting is that sometimes it takes the turn of life savior. They are extroverts and if it takes that turn

87
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:52,079
where the individual goes towards religion, the religious people that go with passion to religion and they want to do something,

88
00:18:52,080 --> 00:19:00,269
 they want to save the world and then they become healers. Because there is a lot of energy, they can become healers.

89
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:10,169
I have seen it in America where you have all these healers who are healing people. They gather and all of them

90
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:19,999
they pray together and then somebody gets better. This type is the Med. type.

91
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:52,120
No Verat. is different.

92
00:19:54,750 --> 00:20:09,679
I had a case once with a retired general of the army. He comes there and I'm taking his case with a lady doctor, next to me.

93
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:18,749
 He talks, he comes for his rhinitis. And we talk more to understand.

94
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:24,999
He tells me how much is involved with a group where he is the leader.

95
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:41,339
And then the idea comes to my mind that he is Med. And now I want to confirm, is he really Med.?

96
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:50,599
He is excited, he tells about his accomplishment, how people are healed. He heals the people

97
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:57,839
we help people, we're doing so much for the people.

98
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:15,319
I say, god when he is going to stop? He was bragging. In the Repertory we see 'egotistical', the ego is

99
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:25,200
very much promoted in Lach., in Plat., in Med.,
 in Sulph. Egotistical people.

100
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:33,999
So he makes all this performance and he doesn't give me a chance to ask him a question.

101
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:47,999
I said, if I ask him now 'did you get gonorrhea?', with all this excitement he will say 'no, never'. So I think something else.

102
00:21:54,370 --> 00:22:01,879
I say to myself if I put a question out to him totally unprotected, he will give me the right answer.

103
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:13,920
So I said to him, not 'did you get gonorrhea?' I said 'at what age did you get gonorrhea, 20 or 21?'

104
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,580
He said '21'.

105
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:43,579
He felt very bad because 'all this and now I'm exposed, I had Gonorrhea'.

106
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:54,059
We talked a little bit more, I said Med., go because I had to see cases very fast. I didn't have time to examine for ever.

107
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:58,329
A quarter of an hour, 20 minutes I had to find the remedy.

108
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:09,679
He goes away, then he never came back to us. He never came back for a follow up.

109
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:18,909
But by that time we didn't care so much about follow up, who comes, who does not come, people were coming in hundreds.

110
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:30,919
So somebody comes and says, 'I am with this general, I belong to this group'. 'Oh, the general.

111
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:53,319
How is he?'. 'He is quite well'. I said, 'he never came back to tell us how he is'. 'Yes because he felt uncomfortable

112
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:58,289
because of some question you put to him'.

113
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:15,769
I said, 'yes I know'. I'm talking about years later. This conversation took place. The man remained well most probably by Med.

114
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:28,949
He had that characteristic symptom of Med.  where I will make you a little bit nauseated now but I have to perform it.

115
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:45,549
Med. wakes up in the morning and there is mucus stuck in the throat and the post nasal mucus stuck there

116
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:54,890
 they feel it, they try to get it out and they cannot. In the morning the wife hears every morning...

117
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:02,910
 Very strongly.

118
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,640
You will never forget that.

119
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:27,600
There is another remedy which also feels stuck, what remedy?

120
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,930
Caust., very good.

121
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:51,959
It's different. The other is really... I mean you ask the wife and it is terrible. I've see it in a woman also, she was infected

122
00:25:51,960 --> 00:26:13,419
by her husband, she says 'it's antisocial but I have to go to the bathroom and try to get out the phlegm'.

123
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:27,399
Because it's bothering them very much and it has to come out to release and if it comes a little bit out, they feel released.

124
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:40,279
-Very often people who smoke for many years they have a lot of phlegm in the throat and they have to clear the throat

125
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:46,170
a lot especially after the night when they were lying down.

126
00:26:49,240 --> 00:27:02,359
-If they clear their throat it can't be Med. The people who smoke usually have the bronchi affected

127
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:09,399
and they are coughing  in the morning. It's different.

128
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:37,069
But you have also to take into consideration that we don't really confess people to the point where it' s OK up to a certain extent

129
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:40,399
when you have the symptoms Med., it's enough.

130
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:55,349
But going to details...what we know is, the idea is: over excited, over sexual, desire for sex a lot

131
00:27:55,350 --> 00:28:13,189
passion, loving passionately the flower, the animals, the woman, the boat etc. But now to the detail it will be not specific.

132
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:35,439
 If you have a pathology, you have a tumor that tumor which is the end result of pathology, this end result of pathology

133
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:46,020
 does not belong specifically to one or other remedy. It belongs to all remedies. All remedies can have the pathology.

134
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:13,369
You have remedies who are over sexed or they have perversions, Plat. and Lach., are the same kind.

135
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:33,819
-I heard and seen that when you take a very high potency of Med., I've seen some people are going a little bit crazy.

136
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:41,249
We had a student in our class, he was normal for two years and then one day he started disappearing

137
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:48,839
 from the class and then I met him somewhere. What happened to you? I took a very high dose of Med. and now

138
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:58,489
I'm writing a new book on LM and he is talking with god. He is treating people just by seeing them and decides,

139
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:08,239
 you know from up, he doesn't have to study anymore. He goes really crazy and he was a nice kid. He took about 50M or more.

140
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,640
-I don't know, I don't have that experience.

141
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:31,799
 It might be because he took Cann-i. the day before, I don't know.

142
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:49,409
-If I remember correctly you said once in one of your discussions or seminars in Germany that it can be very dangerous

143
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:57,319
 to give Med. to a person who is over 60 years old, is it correct?

144
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:09,139
-It is correct yes. You be careful always in older age not to go very high, with Med.  especially.

145
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:14,899
Because it's a powerful individual who has powerful reactions.

146
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:26,879
You may expect that you may have some powerful reactions, especially in people with heart problems.

147
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:35,019
You have to be careful. If the heart is involved one way or another, better go up to 200, not higher.

148
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:49,239
-If the amelioration by the sea is missing and instead you have fear of the sea because you had some incident

149
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:57,239
 in your childhood, could it still be Med.? Let's say you're almost being drowning but you are better in the evening

150
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,359
and all the other things are right?

151
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,480
-Yes he can absolutely.

152
00:32:04,481 --> 00:32:17,469
Also you remember this position? The knee-elbow position, a position which little children are taking frequently.

153
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:34,619
 And a very characteristic is a red eruption around the gluteal region. Very red eruption. Around the perineum.

154
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:48,729
 Where you use the napkin for the babies, all this area becomes very red, not because of the napkins

155
00:32:48,820 --> 00:33:00,719
 but because of the Med. state. Another thing is the soles of feet, very sensitive. This is also very strong.

156
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:11,000
They cannot walk on ground which is not even. It's painful.

157
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:26,170
And sticking their feet out in the night, feet are burning and they stick them out. Usually they sleep on abdomen.

158
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:33,559
I think that's it.

159
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:54,719
-Did you tell us that 20% of all people that have a suppressed Gonorrhea will die early because of a heart attack?

160
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,479
Between 50 and 55?

161
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:05,039
-No. There are different types of Gonorrhea. There is one type of Gonorrhea which is suppressing Gonorrhea

162
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:23,769
that means going inside. This is out of 1000, it is 100 people. Out of these people a quite big percentage

163
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:35,350
I may even say 20%, they may get a heart attack, not die. A heart attack early, that means from 40 to 55.

164
00:34:35,351 --> 00:34:47,869
 From those they had the Gonorrhea which is suppressed. From discharge in urethra went to condylomata

165
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:57,679
 condylomata were suppressed. Then this you have to watch. Watch these people because a big percentage

166
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:04,960
of this kind of people may develop a heart attack early in life.
