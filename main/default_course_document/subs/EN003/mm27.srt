1
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:38,490
It has that symptom, anxiety about health to a very great degree.

2
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:53,413
Anxiety about health, yet nihilistic. It doesn't believe in anything. Everything is a doubt for him.

3
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:08,473
Why? Because you do not find the remedy immediately and then you have these patients calling you

4
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:20,513
all the time because of their anxiety. You have given Calcarea, Agaricus, this or that remedy and you have Nitric acid

5
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:26,653
calling you all the time, I have this, I have that and what about this? And I have a pimple here, he comes and

6
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:38,160
he wants to see the pimple. You say, ok no problem. Next day they come with another pimple and then with another.

7
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:51,093
They take the shoes off and they show you in the end of the nail a little black spot starting perhaps some fungus.

8
00:01:51,160 --> 00:02:05,543
What about this? I don't know. I'm not a medicine man, maybe this is quite serious. This type of a person.

9
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:19,053
A type of a person who does not give, he takes. He looks at you under suspicion and he will not give you credit.

10
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:26,430
You feel he is judging you, he is mistrusting you.

11
00:02:26,497 --> 00:02:33,063
You say, you have nothing, you have no cancer.

12
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:39,550
Because they are afraid of some serious disease
What is a serious disease? Cancer.

13
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:46,693
They will leave you and go to another doctor. And tell them you have no cancer. And leave him and go to another doctor.

14
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:56,090
As if they try to find a doctor to tell them, yes you have cancer. If this happens with this patient

15
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:10,823
 the anxiety goes so deep that overwhelms the patient. And really you have him all the time coming back to you.

16
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,333
20 doctors told him no problem. 1 doctor told him maybe that is cancer.

17
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:28,703
Then that is the truth. He said the truth. All the 20 others did not know what they were talking about.

18
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:32,610
That type of a person.

19
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:45,573
Before they reach this terrible anxiety state, there is an anxiety where they feel they have something serious.

20
00:03:45,640 --> 00:04:00,293
And then they go to a state where you say, ok we're not eternal. We're going to die maybe I will die soon

21
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:14,590
 and then lose the joy of life. They lose the joy of life and they become nihilistic.

22
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:48,273
One who believes everything is a zero.

23
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:55,103
-He believes in the worst.
-No, he doesn't believe in anything.

24
00:04:55,170 --> 00:05:08,453
-A non believer with a negative side. Everything is zero. Everything is nothing. Nothing is worthy.

25
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:15,093
There are no good doctors, there are no good people.

26
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:23,370
Not even pessimist. He's something else.

27
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:43,763
In the morning, especially they have this attitude in the morning when they wake up, they wake up in such a bad mood,

28
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:49,863
 'Don't talk to me in the morning'. That type of attitude.

29
00:05:51,090 --> 00:06:09,813
They enter the office and somebody says, 'good morning'. They say 'morning'. Leave me alone. Is it possible to be a good morning?

30
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:21,263
It's a little bit of exaggeration but I'm talking about real cases which I have treated.

31
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:38,680
And typical cases where you get the real picture. They also think of suicide. With this attitude nothing is worth doing.

32
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:48,493
They have a suicide but at the same time there is the anxiety, fear of death, fear of anxiety and anxiety about health.

33
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:59,840
So they think of suicide all the time but they don't do it because they are afraid. Afraid of death, afraid of suicide.

34
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:06,853
-I have a question about fear of cancer. They go from one physician to the other.

35
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:13,773
And they are so happy when somebody just
 hints about the possibility of a positive answer.

36
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:24,420
- They are not happy exactly. They are satisfied. I thought I had cancer, now they found it. Or the liver, whatever they find.

37
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:33,333
-Does this not mean that in the emotional level they do have something which is asking for definition?

38
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:40,653
And they might call it cancer but inside they have something which is calling all the time and ask for touch.

39
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:48,093
I mean I have to believe that there is something emotionally which drives them all the time to do it.

40
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:57,433
-Maybe you have a point but I cannot go so far analyzing. What I described is facts. I described the way

41
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:05,093
that I have seen them behaving. I cannot analyze why they behave this way.

42
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:11,493
I mean the anxiety which I have seen is really tremendous. When the anxiety you see is overwhelming

43
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:20,973
the first remedy you think is Nitric acid and then Kali arsenicum and then Argentum nitricum and then Phosphorus.

44
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:34,773
Also there is another attitude. I mean listen to this person who is like this.

45
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:41,410
 Cannot forget. Unforgiving.

46
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:53,693
Something you have done.You have insulted him and he cannot forget, impossible. It stays, sticks inside.

47
00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:08,093
And you ask: 'if they come and ask you excuse me I have hurt you, will you feel satisfied? Will you forget?'

48
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:17,863
They will say invariably, 'I say ok but inside me I cannot forget, I cannot forgive'.

49
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:33,523
Unrefreshed sleep, waking at 2 a.m. As I said they wake up in a terrible state and with irritability

50
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:43,600
with tiredness and the day starts very very bad always.

51
00:09:51,560 --> 00:10:04,583
One of my very first cases was a terrible case of acne vulgaris. Terrible in a Greek salesman, he was in a shop

52
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:10,920
and I was frequenting the shop.

53
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:25,520
I had been studying 2-3 months already.

54
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:32,783
He says, can you do something for me? Or somebody else told him, ask George.

55
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:47,840
He said, why not. I did everything, I also drank my urine and nothing happened. He can give me.

56
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,013
I gave him a low potency because I was in the beginning, I did not know.

57
00:10:53,080 --> 00:11:08,080
He had a big reaction. He felt dizzy, I have to leave the shop, go home for 1-2 days and in 40 days his face was clean.

58
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:19,853
So all the customers they were coming said, 'what you did?' because they knew him for years with this terrible acne.

59
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:27,613
So a lot of customers come because of that.

60
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:37,600
And I remember this characteristic, I asked the boss how he behaves and all that?

61
00:11:37,667 --> 00:11:43,823
'He comes in the morning, we say good morning, he never answers.

62
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:55,193
And I tell him there are customers here, you have to laugh, he cannot do it. And also I tell you something, he says.

63
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:09,600
I have noticed that he bought a gun and he carries this gun and I asked him why and he answered me

64
00:12:09,667 --> 00:12:14,680
 in case... I need it.'

65
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:27,970
He says, 'I'm worried because if he commits suicide with that state of mind, my shop will be in trouble.'

66
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:37,720
He took Nitric acid and he sold his gun. He became another person all together. Very interesting.

67
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:50,953
-Is it possible that alcoholics can reach that state?

68
00:12:53,270 --> 00:13:07,813
-Yes they can reach that state but in order to be Nitric acid they have to have this feeling that he hurt me

69
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,593
I cannot forgive, I cannot forget'.

70
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:24,220
-Revengeful.
-It is not revengeful actually. It is they cannot forget, this is very important for Nitric acid.

71
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:48,613
-Does this state of mind can be the cause for drinking?

72
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:57,080
- I said, no. Because they are afraid of their health and they are careful.

73
00:13:57,147 --> 00:14:08,653
Some other things we have, the urine smell like horse urine. If you get that symptom also is a beautiful symptom for Nitric acid.

74
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:22,880
 Many many you ask but some of these cases they will say, 'yes exactly'. And this is a beautiful confirmation for Nitric acid.

75
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:38,253
 Also you have cracking in jaws while chewing and also cracks on the corners of the mouth.

76
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:52,120
Desires fat, salt and children indigestible things. Fat and salt, this combination if it is strong, esp. if fat...

77
00:14:54,830 --> 00:15:00,303
You know the way we say fat here, he says:

78
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:09,133
 'I look to the plates of the others and I take all the fat which is left by others and I eat it'.

79
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:17,533
 That's really desire for fat, this remedy has really desire for fat.

80
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,840
He eats his fat in the plate but also the fat which is left in the plates of others.

81
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:43,143
The feet are perspiring and very offensive and the perspiration is acid. It can eat up the socks.

82
00:15:51,680 --> 00:16:05,150
Splinter like pains which we saw also in Hepar sulphur. What other symptom of this remedy Hepar sulphur has?

83
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,640
Chilly yes.

84
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:33,613
Not offensive discharge. Hepar Sulphur has discharges like cheese, smelling like old cheese.

85
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:46,123
Also we said it has splinter like pains.

86
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:08,940
I want to go to the next remedy which is Nux vomica.

87
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:36,813
Before I start with Nux vomica, I want to give you some kind of advice of how to study.

88
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:48,520
I gave you too much information and it is stuffed now. Maybe you are confused in your head at this moment.

89
00:17:50,420 --> 00:18:02,093
But what I want to say, if you go back and you try to see your notes and you also have the assistance of these points

90
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:09,623
 try to establish the uniqueness of each remedy in your mind.

91
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:19,133
What is unique. These remedies they don't look alike. They are very much apart for one who knows.

92
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:35,393
Getting from the start the difference between the one and the other is the secret of success for Homeopathy.

93
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:41,813
When I read Homeopathy, the first book as you know it was this book.

94
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:56,973
I read this book right through if I remember well in 3 days or less. I read all the remedies, I was going one by one

95
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:02,973
and of course in the end you will think I could remember anything.

96
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:10,393
But what actually had impressed me during that time, it was some points from each remedy.

97
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,080
Oh, this is good for colds.

98
00:19:13,147 --> 00:19:20,103
 I did not know diseases by that time, I had no idea what disease is and how complicated it might be

99
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:25,973
and different types and then by reading this I'm reading all these diseases of the human race

100
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:33,093
I said, my God all this happens?
What they describe here?

101
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:40,303
But what it stayed was the essential things for each remedy.

102
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:49,783
So later on I would think, there was a remedy that is especially for the nails.

103
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:57,480
I would see the case and said that's the remedy, I read it. It was M....

104
00:19:57,547 --> 00:20:08,093
Myristica. I read this... felons around the nail and strong inflammation.

105
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:18,493
So each remedy has a unique personality. If you manage to get these few unique things for the remedy,

106
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,893
you have 50 % of your success.

107
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,893
It is unbelievable but it is true.

108
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:35,813
The problem is that usually when they teach Homeopathy, they try to teach everything in a remedy.

109
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:42,113
Of course the teacher himself maybe he is not clear of what is important, what is not important.

110
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:47,493
So coming here and clarifying this, take advantage of that clarification.

111
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:59,603
Take advantage of this point and try to remember  the uniqueness of the combination of 3-4 symptoms.

112
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:11,573
Here what is the uniqueness in the combination? It's the irritability, tremendous irritability

113
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:24,843
 easily anger and impatience and indigestion.

114
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:42,273
If you remember 3 i's, for instance. You make different combinations in your mind. Nux vomica is 3 i's.

115
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:55,773
Indigestion, irritability, impatience. So you see that the case has these 3.

116
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:17,913
Competitive. The Nux vomica you remember irritable and impatient and especially when they get tired

117
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:33,540
when they are confronted with a lot of issues, Nux vomicas they can just break the table of break this one here.

118
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:43,290
 The telephone will go like this. It's exactly like that.

119
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:03,573
Especially when pressurized, why?  Because they are people who accept responsibility,

120
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:08,843
 who are able, clever, quick to act and impatient.

121
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:18,333
Come on, come on, you didn't leave the place yet? He expects that you told him something and he is out.

122
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:36,233
What do you wait for? Many times you will see a Nux vomica from the way he behaves in the waiting room.

123
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:44,253
Many times it has happened that because you are many times late, you had a difficult case before

124
00:23:44,320 --> 00:24:00,253
 you couldn't calculate the time and he is late.
Then he comes like this, 5 minutes is ok. 10 minutes, 15 minutes he jumps.

125
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:09,860
 He goes to the secretary and says, 'listen is the doctor going to take me, yes or not? I had an appointment at 4 and it's a 4.15'.

126
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:20,773
The secretary says, 'wait a moment'. She calls you and say, 'somebody is upset'. 'Yes, please tell him to wait'. 'He cannot wait'.

127
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:35,813
Then you have to go out yourself to say, please Mister so and so. I'm very sorry but I have a very difficult case inside

128
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:41,153
almost dying and I have to deal. Can you wait? Can you give me another 15 minutes?

129
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:56,093
  You have to say exactly the minutes. If you don't go out and it is 25 min. he says, good bye, he goes.

130
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:03,383
Next time he comes, you know his remedy, if he comes. Maybe he will never come back.

131
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:14,923
That is the nerve, the irritability, the angriness which is with Nux vomica. And many times they have left the office.

132
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:21,663
And many times they try to find relief, they cannot and they come back.

133
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:33,093
And you explain to them. As soon as you explain, they go inside, they satisfy their ego, they calm down.

134
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:39,223
 It's ok but next time don't do it to me.
They cannot wait, impatient.

135
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:50,333
 Irritable and especially when they are overloaded and they are tired, there are two things

136
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:56,773
one they cannot sleep and second they cannot hold their anger back.

137
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:04,080
Immediately with the least provocation they will just shout.

138
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:18,730
So this is the Nux vomica and in a little bit exaggerated form but you will see different steps of that remedy.

139
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:24,983
What is an organism who works like that? Spasmodically?

140
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:31,973
Take this, he speaks on the telephone and in the other hand he signs. Go away.

141
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:41,303
What do you expect? Digestion going into pieces, duodenal ulcer will develop, cannot evacuate the stool.

142
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:50,333
 The stool will not come out. So the urge is there, the stool will not come out or they will go many many times before they can go out.

143
00:26:50,400 --> 00:27:05,560
Frequent urging with no effect is a typical constipation for Nux vomica and also the stool is usually dry and little balls together.

144
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:13,320
People who are suffering with constipation a lot.

145
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:25,353
 I am like this and I have an obligation.
I have to be here 4 o'clock.

146
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:32,543
 There is pressure, interviews etc. and I say, no I have to be at 4 o'clock, please make it quickly.

147
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:40,653
And I'm exhausted; so I need what? Stimulants. You need stimulants. What kind?

148
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:55,583
I drink coffee. Beer, alcohol, not the time of the work. They need stimulants to continue the work

149
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:58,973
 because the work demands a lot of energy.

150
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:06,893
Now in the night, when you go back home, you cannot sleep. As I said, they have sleeplessness.

151
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:20,503
Now in order to calm down and to relax, you need your whisky, 1 does no relax, 2 whiskies do not relax

152
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:33,880
3 whiskies do not relax, 4 whiskies you fell unconscious. I don't know how many whiskies each one can tolerate.

153
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:46,933
 I've never tasted actually the whisky. I don't even know the taste but unfortunately when I teach and I have

154
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:54,613
so many obligations, so many people asking things, my energy goes down and I have to drink coffee, as you see

155
00:28:54,680 --> 00:29:06,963
and then I become very irritable. But I don't take a Nux-v immediately because this is a passing thing if you sleep.

156
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:21,493
Tomorrow I'm leaving the island totally and perhaps I sleep 12-14 hours and then I recover. And that's how I can continue.

157
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:28,343
Because immediately after your course, I have the Russian doctors who are coming from Moscow.

158
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:48,263
So sleeplessness and wakes 3-4 a.m. You will see a lot of remedies which have sleeplessness.

159
00:29:48,330 --> 00:30:02,583
They sleep 1,2,3 hours and then they wake up. That's the time. 2,3,4 o'clock they wake up and then they cannot sleep anymore.

160
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:12,523
And Nux-v sleeps why? Because he stimulates himself and the organism is stimulated and cannot relax

161
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:20,373
 and go back to full relaxation that requires for sleep.

162
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:28,140
And then you have the nervous bladder.

163
00:30:28,207 --> 00:30:34,173
 The same thing that happens with the colon, it happens with the bladder.

164
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:44,603
Urging to urinate, a little bit comes out, a few drops. And then urging all the time, the woman or the man

165
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:50,770
has to go to the toilet and only a few drops are coming. The same thing with constipation.

166
00:30:50,837 --> 00:31:03,813
  You see the nervousness behind the idea of constipation. It's a nervous, irritable colon, irritable urinary bladder.

167
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:16,923
And of course you expect increased sexual desire. Of course, with all this energy.

168
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:33,573
You stimulate the energy and then the sexual desire is increasing and also you will see the impotency as well.

169
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:45,253
And the impotency is not that there is no erection but the erection is lost the moment that you start the sexual intercourse.

170
00:31:47,820 --> 00:32:09,573
Stimulants, desires, spices, fat, tasty, spicy things, with strong taste, alcohol, stimulants, coffee, tea, whatever.

171
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:18,613
Nux-v people reach a point where they are totally exhausted.

172
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:26,093
I've seen it in ministers when they are overwhelmed with the work.

173
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:39,933
And they go constantly without much sleep, in the end there is total exhaustion which looks like Calc.

174
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:54,673
Calc. is a remedy for total exhaustion and nervous breakdown. They give up and say, we cannot do anything, anymore.

175
00:32:54,740 --> 00:33:09,413
Nux-v will continue even in break down will continue to try to work. Calc. will say, forget it. I have to leave the work.

176
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:15,833
And many times they leave the work. Worse exertion, as we say.

177
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:24,673
They have worse exertion, too much work and then nervous breakdown and they have to leave.

178
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:34,693
Businessmen they stop the business, they cannot sign a check. They do not know what they're signing.

179
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,683
It's a total exhaustion of the organism.

180
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:53,413
We exhausted the organism and the society is structured in such a way that we're entering patterns of unhealthy living.

181
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:04,243
You are making all these efforts, expenses, airplanes, running, ferryboats they are bringing you here

182
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:10,873
and then finally you come here and I'm involved with that. I know the responsibility of that, that you have to learn

183
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:22,163
 that you don't have to do this, that you have to have so much information because your time and energy has to be repaid etc.

184
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:28,503
So I enter a pattern, you enter a pattern of not healthy living.

185
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:34,493
Because you came here and you should have been relaxing much more. And I don't give you this chance.

186
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:45,653
I make you work when you should be swimming during the morning hours. The lecture hours should be less

187
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:56,130
 to be more healthy. So if it was a School every day for a year it would be much more easy. But we cannot do that.

188
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:02,223
And now we enter to that pattern and many of us we become Nux vomicas.

189
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:11,913
- Is it possible that Nux then can sleep 14h a night or is somebody who can sleep

190
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:16,253
14h after exhaustion, not Nux vomica anymore?

191
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:33,773
-You may be looking like Nux-v but you are not Nux-v, especially when this is something which is temporary, for a period of time.

192
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:44,613
You push the organism and then an organism who is not Nux-v can sleep 15-20 hours.

193
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:54,093
Then you are not Nux-v. Nux-v does not allow you to sleep. Continue to go on without sleep.

194
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:04,413
If you exert yourself for a week and you become irritable, you don't mean to take Nux-v, just because of that.

195
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:14,783
Because if you sleep and you can sleep in the weekend, you say in the weekend OK I will not do anything

196
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:24,253
 and you manage to sleep, then your strength is recovered. And you don't need Nux-v.

197
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:32,213
But you can drive yourself to a Nux-v state by staying awake the weekend, by pushing yourself in the weekend

198
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:34,963
by doing things in the weekend.

199
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:45,440
Superficial Nux-v. It's like having a flu. It's the same thing.

200
00:36:46,680 --> 00:37:05,293
Fastidious of course. Fastidiousness in Nux-v is different than Arsenicum. It's the desire to do the job perfect.

201
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:15,043
They have a project and you have to do this. The organization and the performance; in this part, they are fastidious

202
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:20,983
but they are not fastidious, as far as I know at least, with their clothing.

203
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:36,103
The Arsenicum has to be perfect in appearance. The Nux-v wants to be perfect in performance.

204
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:49,883
Arsenicum perfection in appearance.
For Nux-v it's OK to be like this.

205
00:37:49,950 --> 00:38:01,703
For Arsenucum it's not OK the table to be like this. As long as there is a perfection in performance.

206
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:09,973
Therefore fastidious. They say, 'why didn't you do it? I told you to do this. I tell you to write the envelope

207
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:15,510
it's going to the Prime Minister, it has to be written this way, write it again'.

208
00:38:17,387 --> 00:38:28,293
 Maybe it will act but it has to be more towards the cold. Not absolutely cold but some people are very cold

209
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:33,213
some are less cold but towards the cold. And even if a person is warm and he is going to Nux-v state,

210
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:39,783
 his temperature of the body will lower down. That means not so warm as I used to be, he will say.

211
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:56,213
 Somebody is very irritable and this irritability comes from exertion, too much exhaustion

212
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:05,453
 then they are tired, they become very irritable.

213
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:23,240
They even sometimes can break out crying from exhaustion, from tiredness, they break out crying.

214
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:37,173
-When I started to learn Homeopathy, I took Nux-v and I had a proving but it happened so that I was only shouting

215
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:44,453
and couldn't stop anymore. So somebody said, you have to antidote with camphor.

216
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:54,693
And I took camphor and I had a camphor proving within 20 minutes. What happened there? I thought I die.

217
00:39:54,760 --> 00:40:06,053
-You are sensitive, you are a good prover. We need people like you in a proving of a remedy.

218
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:15,613
There are some people whose organism reacts very easily to homeopathic remedies.

219
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:29,093
Something else I will tell you because later on I will talk about provings and I will give the conditions

220
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:41,293
and the type of person that can make provings. She is the type, she is sensitive and she proves she is down to earth.

221
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:48,213
She will not use projections and imaginations and delusions and all kind of things.

222
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:53,693
Because in a proving you can imagine anything you like.

223
00:40:53,760 --> 00:41:01,933
 Especially if you are a little bit the type of person who says what is going to happen to me?

224
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:19,553
If you are that type, you better stay away from provings. You cannot do provings. You are not allowed to do provings

225
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:31,193
because you will give wrong information and this information will be written down by somebody else who thinks

226
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:36,173
 it's a great proving and then we have misinformation.

227
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:43,253
And in Homeopathy we have suffered from misinformation, I can tell you.

228
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:58,293
The whole of our science has suffered from misinformation. It is so difficult to say, this remedy is like that

229
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:05,713
because you can be describing only the character of one person, of one patient.

230
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:16,023
Which has nothing to do with the remedy. You give a remedy and then you go and describe his character.

231
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:18,513
His character is different than mine, different than his.

232
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:32,363
Each one of us has a different personality. So if I give him Euphrasia, now he comes he is better.

233
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:40,443
Then I see and I say, Euphrasia is asking a lot of questions because he is asking a lot of questions.

234
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:42,943
That is describing his personality.

235
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:53,543
Euphrasia is very theoretical, by looking at him, it has baldness here.

236
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:58,023
Whatever I can see, then I attribute it to Euphrasia, is wrong.

237
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:11,803
I have to separate the pathology from the personality traits. One person is a thinker, he thinks a lot

238
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:22,963
it is his personality and he is Nux-v . Another one is much more alert and quick. Still he is Nux-v.

239
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:46,820
How is a Nux-v  in a farmer? In an intellectual? In a painter? How is in a scientific man? How is in a performer?

240
00:43:47,320 --> 00:44:01,573
 You don't get the same type but all of them they will have this easy arousal, all of them they will be impatient, constipated.

241
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:20,093
But if I have a case of a Nux-v artist, you know artists most of them they are not healthy people.

242
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:28,673
 If you want to be a real artist, you have to be really sick. You don't agree, right.

243
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:38,143
 You have to be somewhat sick to be an artist because you are a sensitive person.

244
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:46,573
You are a person who perceives the world in a different way and this is the artist.

245
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:57,043
He describes the new, perceives the new.
So this requires a sensitivity in the organism.

246
00:44:57,110 --> 00:45:10,653
 These people of course in their sexual life they will be totally different in their behavior than a scientist Nux-v.

247
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:23,713
So if you take their sexual life and describe it as general sexual behavior of Nux-v, you are going wrong.

248
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:33,353
You are going the wrong direction and this is what is happening today. And I say, this is misinformation, come back to basics.

249
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:41,633
But basics that you can put your feet down in the earth and say, I can base myself here.

250
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:53,703
In Nux-v I have seen a lot of perversions. Extra energy which is there, they have different kinds of imagination, sex.

251
00:45:53,770 --> 00:46:03,800
It's not use describing to you all these details though it would make an interesting lesson of course.

252
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:15,853
But it's no use because if I do, I will be most probably describing the peculiarities of a personality

253
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:27,880
of an artist or a lawyer or a doctor.

254
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:44,883
Who should be a prover? Later on when we'll know more Homeopathy we'll do some provings all together

255
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:49,853
or those people who are interested and then I will tell you who can be and who cannot.

256
00:46:51,760 --> 00:47:00,183
I don't advice you at this moment to do provings because you don't know when to start, when to finish

257
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:05,580
what to write down, what not to write down. It's no use.

258
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:21,133
-I once had a patient who was in a coma. I did not have any symptoms I could use, I only knew the cause.

259
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:31,373
He had received antibiotics, he was taking a lot of drugs and had a lot of alcohol. So I gave him Nux-v 10M

260
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:41,633
and he woke the same evening. I just wanted to ask, Nux-v is frequently given to people not only who like stimulants

261
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:45,383
 but also for the ailments after stimulants?

262
00:47:48,040 --> 00:48:00,703
-Yes it is true. The idea is this. You stimulate the body, you produce many times a kind of Nux-v.

263
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:08,123
That's why we say, he has taken a lot of drugs, give him Nux-v. Because he has taken a lot of drugs.

264
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:13,863
Generalization of that type is not accurate of course.

265
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:22,803
 The question is why he was in a coma?

266
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:39,553
-His friends just told me that he had taken antibiotics, he had drunk a lot of alcohol and was taking a lot of drugs, that was all I knew.

267
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:43,263
-So therefore he was in a coma because of the drugs.

268
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:52,653
-I think so. Medication-drugs-alcohol.

269
00:48:54,230 --> 00:49:06,773
-If you don't have anything else to go by and if the person has come back, in the older books

270
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:15,133
they used to describe cases with the word debaucher.

271
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:29,003
These high livers who lived with a lot of women, liquer, a lot of sex and then they go to bed

272
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:35,442
3 o'clock in the morning they have to get up at 7 and they feel terrible. They said, take a dose of Nux-v.

273
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:50,543
 And sometimes it works of course because you have created a state of Nux-v like in his case and it works. Not always.

274
00:49:53,130 --> 00:50:00,783
-I had a patient who was a Nux-v, very nervous and swearing at home and shouting and smoking very heavily.

275
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:11,176
I gave her 1M once and she could not get near the cigarette. The effect was so strong.

276
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:18,880
 She said she has nauseated from cigarette from that moment and she quit smoking.

277
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:27,840
-That's very good effect. She became healthy very soon.

278
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:47,170
 Smoking cigarettes and all kinds of stimulants, taking drugs, hashish. Now they are on free market.

279
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:11,123
 We come to a remedy which is actually the opposite of Nux-v.

280
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:26,463
The typical Opium case is a case who is satisfied under all conditions. Satisfaction under all conditions.

281
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:47,623
What happened to the lady who took Apis? It's much better. Yesterday it was closed.

282
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:57,720
So perhaps those that have seen this case and looked like her case.

283
00:51:57,787 --> 00:52:05,973
In this case Apis acted very well, in her case Ledum acted very well.

284
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:17,933
Though they look almost identical because they were bitten on the same place, yet not the same remedy.

285
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:34,363
The situation is the same. The remedy is totally different. People are infected by a specific virus and they develop 20 different pictures.

286
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:47,573
The virus is the same. But it was so identical, her case with her case, you couldn't differentiate. So you have to take a chance.

287
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:56,553
Still it's a little bit hot, maybe one more dose.

288
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:19,993
In the previous seminar with the Italian doctors suddenly I come and there is somebody who has collapsed

289
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:31,903
sitting there and 10 of other doctors, students did that and that. The one the rescue remedies, the other take this.

290
00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:44,813
What happened? He said he had an accident because of the sun. He felt dizzy, he fell down and hit this.

291
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,653
Everyone was very excited.

292
00:53:57,570 --> 00:54:17,253
Then I saw him, he was really exhausted. He said, 'I want to vomit'. I touched his forehead, it was cold and sweaty.

293
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:29,574
I told him to give a dose of Carb-v. The doctors said, we take him back to lie down.

294
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:45,653
 I said, wait 2 minutes. He said, 'it's OK I will stay to see the class'. He attended the class.

295
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:59,520
In half an hour his temperature was
normal and next day he felt totally well.

296
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:06,520
So in all seminars we have some excitement.

297
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:19,850
I will take all the videos of the accidents during homeopathic seminars.

298
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:24,970
Happy under all conditions!

299
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:39,800
There is happiness and sleepiness.

300
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:47,773
You talk to him and suddenly, I have seen it honestly

301
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:55,653
 there was a fat man, from the very first cases, I'm talking about 1960.

302
00:55:55,720 --> 00:56:12,543
He said, my thyroid is affected. He was very very fat. We said a few words and then as he was sitting there, I hear hrrr....

303
00:56:18,370 --> 00:56:25,043
No more taking of the case. You like these things because you learn, you remember.

304
00:56:26,690 --> 00:56:34,773
Overpowering sleep even while talking, while reading. They take to read this.

305
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:39,560
Can you read? No I can read only 3 lines.

306
00:56:51,080 --> 00:57:02,273
It comes after Nux-v who is so alert, so irritable, so impatient and the other one lies down and says, how you feel?

307
00:57:05,730 --> 00:57:18,183
What's called this from lying down a lot? What's called the wounds from lying down? Bed sores.

308
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:30,253
Full of bed sores. 'How do you feel?', 'Quite well'.

309
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:45,960
It's very strange that you see the happiness in the face of this people.

310
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:56,283
 There is a happiness which is almost earthy.

311
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:13,863
No problem. Sleep, wake up for a while, see the world, being happy and go back again.

312
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:18,360
Snoring.

313
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:33,303
 Breathing stops on going to sleep. Which is the remedy which has that? Another remedy we spoke about?

314
00:58:33,370 --> 00:58:44,903
Lachesis. You have to do a lot of study when you go back.

315
00:58:50,260 --> 00:59:04,213
Breathing stops but what is this breathing that stops? It's different mechanism from Lachesis.

316
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:19,870
Lachesis is not connected with breathing. It's breathing, stops, jumps.

317
00:59:24,990 --> 00:59:33,673
Narcolepsy. Do you know narcolepsy? Difficult, slow and intermittent respiration.

318
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:43,600
As if the respiration stops and then starts again.

319
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:57,933
 They have this snoring. It is the state which we see in comas.

320
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:24,123
This deep breathing and there is earthy redness in the face, brown red faces with full lips.

321
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:41,703
Painless in usually painful conditions. We said that. Never mind the pains, the pains do not matter.

322
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:50,520
Complains of nothing. Wants nothing.
Seems to be in bliss though very sick.

323
01:00:51,240 --> 01:01:03,063
Severe constipation, no desire for stool. You see here how the two remedies go opposite? The one says, urging constipation.

324
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:12,790
 The other says, constipation and it's finished. No urging. This constipation looks like Alumina.

325
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:28,733
 Ailments from fright is a very interesting development for Opium because Opium is one of the main remedies for epilepsy.

326
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:38,813
Especially epilepsy in children who have convulsions, they are not bothered by convulsions.

327
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:50,713
They continue and you see this tendency to sleep all the time. They can sleep for hours.

328
01:01:51,490 --> 01:01:58,760
Opium people can sleep 14 hours the day.

329
01:01:58,827 --> 01:02:03,440
Pure bliss!

330
01:02:04,310 --> 01:02:13,293
And that is why people who wanted bliss took Opium and they went to heaven.

331
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:18,180
Who has taken Opium?

332
01:02:19,930 --> 01:02:29,550
Only one. Not, it's not one. I can see 1,2,3,4.

333
01:02:48,770 --> 01:02:55,253
Great flow of ideas, vivid imagination and they have they say, the opposite also.

334
01:02:55,320 --> 01:03:08,100
It's there when Hahnemann speaks of primary and secondary effects of provings.

335
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:22,773
Find paragraphs where Hahnemann speaks of primary and secondary action of drugs. Which paragraphs?

336
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:23,063
-Can you give Opium to children that lie and steal?

337
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:39,693
-Lie is another good quality of Opium. They lie, children can lie, grown ups can lie very easily.

338
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:48,173
In this happiness state, they can borrow money, don't give them back.

339
01:04:56,750 --> 01:05:03,620
It can have an irresponsibility quite strong.

340
01:05:03,687 --> 01:05:13,900
 Where Nux-v is very responsible, this remedy is irresponsible, with big letters.

341
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:21,663
-Is it also for stealing? For children?

342
01:05:21,730 --> 01:05:27,233
-For stealing not so much, for lying yes.

343
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:35,493
-I don't understand if they are such happy sleepers, why they aggravate during and after sleep?

344
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:41,243
-No they are not aggravated after sleep.
-It says aggravated during and after.

345
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:56,673
-During the breathing stop suddenly. While they are sleeping.

346
01:06:06,830 --> 01:06:21,183
They sleep deeply. Narcolepsy, falls into a heavy, stupid sleep. Which is the description also of a coma situation.

347
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:33,813
That's why it's a specific remedy for coma. When somebody is in coma really, with a brain stroke, with heart attack

348
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:46,293
coming out of the operation room without being recovering. And the breathing is of that type, the snoring is there

349
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:52,950
 the redness is there, then Opium will bring out of the coma.

350
01:06:54,930 --> 01:07:03,373
-I think of another case I have had. He was a very old man, 95 years old and normally very sleepy

351
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:12,813
sitting at the table and suddenly his son was calling me because he had hallucinations. He saw children who were

352
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:24,183
  not there and when I came he invited us to drink wine and he presented us persons who were not there.

353
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:30,853
And he was very happy, talking with his hallucinations, would that be a state of Opium too?

354
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:34,093
-Yes it can be.

355
01:07:45,070 --> 01:07:55,223
-I wish to ask you about the other side of Opium as this is the indolent side of Opium.

356
01:07:55,290 --> 01:07:57,533
-Yes great indolence.

357
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:01,553
-But there is also the other side. Over sensitivity.

358
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:11,073
-But let us remember that side now. I don't give you all the Materia Medica of all the remedies. I give you the most

359
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:26,493
important and those that you will really see. If we start going into details, we could do at most one remedy in a day.

360
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:38,013
Now we reach 45 remedies. It's very strange that with the Italians we reached the same number exactly.

361
01:08:40,230 --> 01:08:46,653
We could not make 50. 50 was not possible for me, for them.

362
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:52,630
In which potency can I give Opium?

363
01:08:52,697 --> 01:09:02,870
In potency you can give any potency,
as long as you don't give the real Opium.

364
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:24,573
Give it in potency. We can give from 6C to CM. You know now what it means 6C.

365
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:41,903
To a 4 year child, shock during birth, painlessness, often sleeping, appear less than 3 years in articulation.

366
01:09:42,910 --> 01:09:55,833
What you write here are characteristics of Opium and in such a case you can give it from 200 upwards, 1M, 10M.

367
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:22,823
Shock during birth, ailments from fright we say and you will find in the Repertory.

368
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:45,503
The child does not feel the pain and often sleeps much more and has a retardation. It feels  retarded, cannot articulate.

369
01:10:56,320 --> 01:11:00,243
Have you given Opium in this case?

370
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:12,405
- Before I came here, I just got to know the child briefly because of a tooth problem.

371
01:11:12,730 --> 01:11:18,093
They told me some details about the delivery and by this I got the idea of Opium.

372
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:30,533
I saw the child how retarded it was and my question is now what potency, how high the potency should be

373
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:33,543
which I can give to such a small child?

374
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:38,370
-At least 200 up to 50M.

375
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:45,873
-Last seminar I had asked you a case of sinusitis with a lot of sleepiness and I had prescribed Opium

376
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:52,953
because I did not know the sleepy element of Allium Cepa and you had asked me to give my patient a 10M.

377
01:11:53,020 --> 01:12:03,453
In that patient sinusitis drastically improved, the hypertrophy in the airways was clear, the sleepiness was gone to 90%.

378
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:09,653
He broke out in an urticaria area which was way back in his past history and lasted for about 4 weeks

379
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:16,170
 and his hypertension also came down slowly.
