1
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:27,729
I will give you the  essence of a very well known remedy, Sulph.

2
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:54,069
I'm going to talk to you, as I said, about Sulph., a very well known remedy.

3
00:00:54,820 --> 00:01:06,569
Many times the patient comes and he is Sulph. and we miss it. Why?

4
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:20,079
Because there is some information that has been given which is not wrong, it is said in such a way...

5
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,280
For instance, Sulph. is worse from heat.

6
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:33,239
 And you take it that this is absolutely so.

7
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:41,919
But you get a patient who is shivering
 from cold and he needs Sulph.

8
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:53,319
In your mind the idea of Sulph. being a warm remedy has been stuck and you cannot get it out.

9
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:17,100
From Kent and from other Materia Medicas, it is said in our books that Sulph. is a tall, stooped shouldered person

10
00:02:17,101 --> 00:02:21,799
dirty looking and philosophical.

11
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:35,149
You get the picture of an old man with beard, stooped shouldered and with philosophical ideas.

12
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,850
Where can you find such patient today?

13
00:02:40,851 --> 00:02:48,479
Forget it. Not even once in your life, you
will come in contact with this description.

14
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,790
But this description remains in our minds.

15
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:10,480
So what is actually true for Sulph. is that
when this element is needed...

16
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:22,450
...the characteristic of such a person
today a contemporary Sulph. case...

17
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:46,159
...is a person who enquires a lot, who is a skeptic, he wants to know why about everything.

18
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:56,280
Nothing passes him unless he makes
 an enquiry. I want to know why.

19
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,879
Not only he wants to know why but
eventually he can make a theory about it.

20
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,959
About the problem he was thinking.

21
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:29,450
Therefore if you take this type of person and you apply it today, you will see a kind of scientist who is involved

22
00:04:29,451 --> 00:04:35,209
too much with his mind and his thinking processes.

23
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:53,729
And the occupation of the mind is so much that the outside environment has no importance at all.

24
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:09,819
He is enquiring and he is trying to find out the truth; so he reads a lot, journals, books etc.

25
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:21,319
But he will never take a book and read it and take the book back to the shelf. The book will be left there

26
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:27,119
he will take another book, read and leave it there.

27
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:35,780
In the end when you ask such a typical
 person, how is your office?

28
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:47,449
 They say, 'it is a mess but I know exactly where I have everything. If somebody comes and touches

29
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:53,340
something, I know somebody has entered the room'.

30
00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:02,079
I remember the description of a person.
 I said, how is your room?

31
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:19,209
He says, it looks like a bombarded place. If you want to walk, you have to find little empty spaces to walk in the room.

32
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:25,829
Everything, the newspapers, the journals,
the books are all over the place.

33
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:39,119
I want to slowly develop the idea of that person who is enquiring. In the book it says, 'critical'.

34
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:48,139
It is one of the main remedies for
 being critical. What is critical with him?

35
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:54,799
It is that nothing passes by.
He wants to know the reason.

36
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:08,809
This is the idea behind because we have other remedies which we call critical but the basis of their criticism is different.

37
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:27,759
Ars. is very critical but Ars. is going to be very proper, the opposite of Sulph., very fastidious and his criticism

38
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:33,940
is always towards this disorder which is around him.

39
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:42,050
The one is with total disorder around him and he is critical.

40
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:47,920
The other needs absolute order and he is critical.

41
00:07:47,921 --> 00:07:56,619
He's critical because people are not correct, people are not honest, people are this and that.

42
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:08,617
Sulph. is not interested. He is interested about the essence of things. The truth. It's philosophy behind.

43
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:21,969
Ars. is not philosophy. Ars. what he wants is a materialistic person. He wants material things to be in order.

44
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:42,469
When I come here for the class I do this, I put this, 2 times, my shoes will be ... Absolute order.

45
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:53,559
When I see disorder inside, I become very critical. Look at him.

46
00:08:53,560 --> 00:09:00,039
Sulph. critical but in what?

47
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:42,559
When you take a case and you ask somebody 'are you critical?'. He says 'yes'.

48
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:50,709
You have to put it in context this critical.
What do you mean?

49
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:01,680
The real Sulph. patient will tell you a theory.

50
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:18,769
He will say, 'I don't accept ideas. I want to prove them myself. I want to know why the earth goes around the sun'.

51
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,519
 They are real scientists.

52
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:31,949
The problem is, when they need Sulph.,
they have gone too far in that respect.

53
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:43,639
That means the mind cannot anymore control itself. They are thinking without them being able to stop thinking.

54
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:57,359
Eventually there is an anxiety which develops. How this anxiety manifests?

55
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:08,449
This anxiety manifests in mainly two ways. Anxiety about the children and what is going to happen to the children.

56
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:15,299
Tremendous anxiety, they have to know
what time are you coming back.

57
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:30,559
The daughter says about 12 o'clock. 12 o'clock, she is not back. 12:10, 12:30 she goes out of the house

58
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,639
wait to see what happened to the daughter or to the son.

59
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:52,159
This kind of anxiety which is beyond logic. That means the organism has gone astray already.

60
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:06,969
There is another type of anxiety that
develops also which concerns their health.

61
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:17,999
Sulph. is one of the main remedies with
anxiety about health but what kind of anxiety?

62
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,079
They have read between other things, Medicine also. They know quite a lot about Medicine.

63
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:41,760
They know when the urine makes froth
that means there is protein in the urine.

64
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:47,479
And it's tremendous anxiety.

65
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:57,719
Maybe his wife has put some soap before and the urine becomes frothy because of the soap.

66
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:11,719
But he sees the froth and goes out of his mind in anxiety. Tremendous anxiety with the least provocation.

67
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:21,869
They see little things, what is this pain?
What is this? Here it's the liver.

68
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:35,587
In the same way the enquiry about the truth goes too far.

69
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:53,119
You can enquire in your profession, you have some enquiries, you do some research but if this is gone too far

70
00:13:53,120 --> 00:14:06,349
that means your mind keeps all the time occupied with these ideas so it does not allow you to fall asleep and relax.

71
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:18,199
You will see Sulph. waking up in the night, wide awake and immediately the mind starts thinking.

72
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:30,729
They fall asleep again, after an hour they are awake again. They wake up 3,4,5 times during the night.

73
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:40,999
You ask him how is your sleep. In the sleep it has this kind of pattern, waking frequently during the night

74
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:51,489
and the person is not groggy; as when you wake up you cannot open your eyes usually.

75
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:06,239
He is wide awake. And then comes again and again.

76
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:14,769
They are suffering quite a lot from sleeplessness. They have lost the balance already.

77
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:30,489
But you have to understand something else. With this mentality, with this enquiring mind they discover

78
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:46,340
 a lot of things, they read a lot, they know a lot and as a result it comes a kind of egotism. I know everything.

79
00:15:47,560 --> 00:16:04,559
A kind of all the truth. Egotism.
You are telling me? I know.

80
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:19,149
This is the time that he will deal with the issue because he has really enquired quite a lot, he read quite a lot

81
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:30,899
but this brings a state that if you doubt his knowledge, he will be angry.

82
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:53,719
With this mind which is working, with the feelings which are quite strong, the combustion of food is quite powerful.

83
00:16:53,720 --> 00:17:11,559
That means the organism needs fat to work with this engine that goes all the time. It needs a lot of food.

84
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:30,509
The typical Sulph. will have a tremendous appetite, it will eat a lot and especially will eat sugar things and fat.

85
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:49,160
That means alcohol of all types, whisky, wine, sweets, sugar a lot.

86
00:17:49,161 --> 00:18:00,289
They need it in order to give energy to the
brain.  Their brain needs a lot of energy.

87
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:10,959
And they have to take easy energy
which is from alcohol and sweets.

88
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:23,569
Sometimes a Sulph., you may ask, do you eat sweets and they will say no.

89
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:33,059
But if you ask him if he drinks, he will drink quite a lot of alcohol. Replacing sweets with alcohol.

90
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:37,799
Or vice versa, they stop alcohol and they go to sweets.

91
00:18:44,320 --> 00:19:00,429
There is this type who is lean, they take a lot of food but they remain thin because of the energy which is produced

92
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:06,079
quite easily. This is the one type.

93
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:22,359
And this person has the tendency really to be a little bit stoop shouldered especially when they are scientists.

94
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:33,859
Scientists who are sitting all day and reading, they may take that posture.

95
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:56,279
But there is another type of Sulph. who is obese and the characteristic is that he has blood congestions in different parts.

96
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:16,819
The lips can be quite red, the eye can be congested, redness of eyes, the conjunctiva becomes slightly

97
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:26,449
 inflamed becomes reddish and burning like sand.

98
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:38,240
It is characteristic the word that they will use if you ask them, what do you feel, they will say, 'I feel like I have

99
00:20:38,241 --> 00:20:42,489
sand under my eyelids'.

100
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:50,129
It is peculiar but almost they use the same words exactly.

101
00:20:51,640 --> 00:21:03,369
So energy is produced in this organism and how it manifests this energy, it has to go out. They feel very hot

102
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:17,069
they sweat a lot and most of the cases they bring out toxins through the perspiration and the perspiration is offensive.

103
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:31,639
How else they bring out the heat? The heat comes out from two places. One is the soles of the foot

104
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:44,559
which are burning hot and usually they sleep with feet out of covers, whether winter or spring or whatever.

105
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:58,609
That's the one place that heat is excessive. The other place, you remember, this is the down end and this is the high end.

106
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:04,689
They have a vertex which is burning hot.

107
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:19,750
Connect all this, this machine which works
and burns and needs food. It's a peculiar thing.

108
00:22:19,751 --> 00:22:25,269
When is the time that the machine needs fuel?

109
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,680
About 11 to 12 o'clock in the noon time.

110
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:42,549
Usually they say I have a gone empty feeling
 and I have to eat immediately something.

111
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:59,660
An empty feeling in the stomach and they have to eat, why? Because the glucose goes down.

112
00:22:59,661 --> 00:23:12,600
They become hypoglycemic during this time, 11 o'clock. You say, about 11? Oh yes at 11 o'clock I have an empty feeling.

113
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:26,989
What I tell you, are absolute characteristics. If you combine them in a case, it doesn't matter whether he has

114
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:39,119
a liver cirrhosis or whether he has cancer of the colon, cancer of the breast. Never mind the pathology.

115
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:51,179
Once you get this kind of picture as clear as
I described it, the result will be amazing.

116
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:04,659
Also the characteristic pains are burning pains.

117
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:28,519
Something else that you have to connect with the digestion and the combustion which takes place.

118
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:39,439
There is a kind of a fastness inside  this organism, it burns, it burns, it takes in a lot of calories and burns them out.

119
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,719
What happens?

120
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:48,650
It goes to bed and sleeps, 1 hour wakes up,
2 hours wakes up, 3 hours wakes up.

121
00:24:48,651 --> 00:24:55,930
At 5 o'clock in the morning, wakes up
with diarrhea and runs to the bathroom.

122
00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:08,690
5-5.30-6 o'clock and will wake up and they have to rush with almost diarrheic stool, not complete diarrhea

123
00:25:08,691 --> 00:25:16,939
it can be diarrhea sometimes but stool which is soft.

124
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:37,480
They are people who would like the cool
 air, they don't like the heat.

125
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:56,409
They perspire, they like coolness but this is not the desire for fresh air we see in Puls., it is different.

126
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:06,480
This burning, this heat which is produced
within the body, needs some cooling down.

127
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:16,969
 That's why they stick out their feet, out of covers. Sometimes they sleep totally uncovered.

128
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:43,509
Another characteristic will be that they
do not care about their appearance.

129
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:56,179
They can be very dirty and everybody else can see it, they don't care, they don't see it.

130
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:04,080
Cleanliness is not their priority.

131
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:24,400
 They may even wash locally, why? Because they think if I take a bath, I will waste my time.

132
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:34,480
Go to the bath, prepare the water etc.,
 so I wash locally and I go.

133
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:44,739
This is characteristic for them. They do not care.

134
00:27:50,930 --> 00:28:07,329
I remember my gardener, a local man, whom I had here and I saw him, he was having Parkinson's.

135
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:31,370
One day he hurt his thumb because
he was digging and he hurt his thumb.

136
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:38,389
So he said to me, 'do you have a remedy because I have some pain in my thumb'.

137
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:45,920
In the meantime I have seen all this trembling, especially the trembling of the lower lip is characteristic

138
00:28:45,921 --> 00:28:54,906
of Sulph. as well. But what I had observed it was that when he was coming in my place, he was so dirty

139
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:11,159
 he was almost urinated his pants, he
 wouldn't care. He was really dirty.

140
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:19,999
So I said OK I'll give you a good remedy
for your thumb, so I gave him Sulph.

141
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,840
You wouldn't believe that his Parkinson's
 was almost disappeared.

142
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:42,480
The Parkinson's it was within 3-4 months I observed that he was not anymore trembling as before

143
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:47,730
and later on, almost not at all.

144
00:29:51,480 --> 00:30:06,310
The interesting thing was that after some days
 he comes to my house and his clothes are clean.

145
00:30:06,311 --> 00:30:16,569
He has washed them and after that his clothes were really clean.

146
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:34,569
After a year or two, I can't remember, I see again... and I see also his pants again in a terrible state.

147
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:48,745
I said, that is the time and I said, 'don't you have pain in the thumb?'. I found a reason to give him the remedy, anyhow.

148
00:30:49,280 --> 00:31:00,000
He was so anxious about his blood pressure, he would ask me to take his blood pressure. That was the big thing.

149
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:12,929
Usually I would say, I knew how anxious he was about his blood pressure and I would make it a little bit less.

150
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:27,590
But when I see the relapse was coming, I said 'blood pressure is coming up Costas, you may need a remedy'.

151
00:31:27,591 --> 00:31:32,199
 'Yes give me the remedy'.

152
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:45,419
It's very human, it's very interesting that out of such little observations you can save the life of the person.

153
00:31:47,400 --> 00:32:01,479
Once you understand the nature of the remedies, you can recognize this in the patients and then it's beautiful.

154
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:10,569
Each one has its own peculiarities
and you are observant, you will see.

155
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:28,220
Another characteristic is that they cannot stand.

156
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:46,880
In Christian church they stand.

157
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:56,269
You go to the church, you stay in one place, you don't move. This is the worst thing for a Sulph. situation.

158
00:32:56,270 --> 00:33:07,509
To sit still standing without moving. They cannot stand standing.

159
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:40,599
Sulph. is the king of the skin eruptions. It is the main remedy that we have for skin eruptions in general.

160
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:53,319
There is a characteristic that you have to be careful in a skin eruption. That the skin eruption must have itching.

161
00:33:53,320 --> 00:34:01,920
If it does not have itching you better
think twice before you give Sulph.

162
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:21,799
You need the itching in the skin eruption and also you need to tell you that if water touches it makes it worse.

163
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:28,559
They don't like to wash and their eruptions do not like water.

164
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:36,659
If water comes in contact, the itching
 is more, they are aggravated.

165
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:55,249
So eczemas mostly but even other types, neurodermatitis, psoriasis but with itching.

166
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:05,799
Psoriasis usually does not have itching.
 The psoriasis of Sulph. has itching.

167
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:19,330
Sulph. will scratch and scratch and they have a kind of pleasure.

168
00:35:19,331 --> 00:35:29,569
Once they scratch and scratch more and more and the pleasure becomes like an orgasm almost.

169
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:40,809
It's so much the pleasure of scratching.
That's characteristic of Sulph.

170
00:35:48,320 --> 00:36:05,730
For food I told you, they desire very strongly sweets and they have strong aversion for eggs, for sour

171
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:14,649
 for fish and sometimes for olives.

172
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:34,149
They desire meat with fat. If they order meat, they say please leave the fat on, don't cut off the fat.

173
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:49,019
Not as much as Nit-ac. In Nit-ac. is like a bulimia. He sees the fat in the other plate and goes and gets the other

174
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:56,439
 person's fat from his plate.
But Sulph. enjoys it very much.

175
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:26,079
There are some peculiar things. Sulph. looks dirty, he is dirty; therefore his sweat is with a lot of toxins, it smells

176
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:37,870
 he does not realize his own smells but he is very disgusted if he smells the sweat from other people.

177
00:37:37,871 --> 00:37:41,819
They cannot stand it.

178
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:57,450
Also it is very strange that they have great disgust for things...like they go to a restaurant and if they see

179
00:37:57,451 --> 00:38:04,749
 the restaurant is not clean, they leave.
They go to another one. It's very strange.

180
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:17,169
How they perceive the uncleanliness in others and they don't perceive it in themselves, it's very strange.

181
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:30,880
Why? Because they are occupied
 in their mind with questions.

182
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:44,069
That's why they say the real philosopher...
the one who makes discoveries...

183
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:56,440
In older times people who made discoveries were closed in a little room and there in a very dirty environment

184
00:38:56,441 --> 00:39:03,199
 they were connecting wires and things like that.

185
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:15,959
And with the beard, they never shave. Why they don't shave, do you know? Because they are lazy.

186
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:25,240
All this energy is for mental application.

187
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:30,960
They are very lazy.

188
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:50,519
 You gave Lyc. and somebody is doing
 better but he says, 'lately I feel lazy'.

189
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:58,560
The most probable is that he is entering a state of Sulph.

190
00:39:58,561 --> 00:40:11,320
If the person himself realizes that he is entered a state of laziness, he is too lazy to do things, they're entering

191
00:40:11,321 --> 00:40:15,140
 a state of Sulph.

192
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:35,800
And in deep seated cases we see a rotation between Sulph., you may start, then go to Calc., then Lyc.

193
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:52,939
Good organisms that they have been stressed and been degenerated in their health can fall into that pattern.

194
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:13,589
But together with these ideas I gave you, don't forget that a Sulph. case can be very cold. Very cold.

195
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:26,089
Actually I remember a case where she came and said, what is your problem? She says, 'coldness I feel very cold, I can't live'.

196
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:44,799
I had one of my first students, I'm talking in about 68,69 sitting next to me who heard that Sulph. is a warm case.

197
00:41:44,800 --> 00:42:00,080
So he was sitting, he would write
in the prescription pad, I said Sulph.

198
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:08,039
 He turns around, he looks at me,
he doesn't write. I said, Sulph.

199
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:24,459
He writes, he gives the prescription. He says, 'his main problem was feeling cold and you give Sulph.?'

200
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:28,519
I said yes, sometimes this happens.

201
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:48,599
By that time in the Greek team I didn't want to appear as the teacher; so I let my first students become the teacher.

202
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:58,400
And they will say certain things and of course they forgot that I told them, sometimes Sulph. is cold.

203
00:42:58,401 --> 00:43:06,789
So they have taught Sulph. is a very hot person, burning feet, burning vertex.

204
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:10,439
And he says, I don't write.

205
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:29,919
Since that time, a lot of cases that need Sulph., they were very cold patients who needed Sulph.

206
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:42,260
Sour also, lemon, vinegar, they
 don't like. Spices they like.
