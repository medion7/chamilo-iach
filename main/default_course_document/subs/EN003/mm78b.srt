1
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:37,200
I want to talk a little bit about the Ign. state.

2
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:55,739
As keynotes for a remedy which is needed
so many times, in so many cases today.

3
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:08,810
How an Ign. state is made?

4
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:27,589
We can see certain individuals
who are rather closed people.

5
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:38,569
People who will not easily give up their own integrity.

6
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:55,649
Usually such people have an inborn sensitivity, let us say, they have artistic tendencies.

7
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:10,659
Their sensitivities, even if their profession is whatever, a constitutional Ign. has sensitivities, why?

8
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:26,379
Because they are people who were keeping themselves as an observer in life until certain age.

9
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:44,319
That means they protect themselves up to the time when suddenly they fall in love with somebody.

10
00:02:48,060 --> 00:03:04,419
You have to realize that they are sensitive people, serious, they go to Universities, they play the piano, they are artistic.

11
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:21,560
Suddenly the erotic feeling arises and due to the hysterical element which is inborn inside them

12
00:03:21,561 --> 00:03:32,539
they fall into a kind of unconditioned love affair.

13
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:39,580
But they have learned to be observers.

14
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:52,309
They have to be observing themselves. So by the time they fall in love so much, at the same time they see the danger.

15
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:57,920
That if the man leaves me, I'm finished.

16
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:10,849
 All along there is resistance. 'I will not
subdue myself. I will not give up myself'.

17
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:18,620
But at the same time the yearning is, 'I need to see him'.

18
00:04:18,621 --> 00:04:51,090
And many times in our societies, the western civilization -let's call it civilization- the involvement is with an illegal affair.

19
00:04:52,320 --> 00:05:03,989
And Ign. woman can fall in love very easily, much more easily with a married man, who has experience

20
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:27,779
 in love affairs and knows how to handle such an aggressive little animal because Ign. will behave in the beginning

21
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:36,499
 in a very aggressive way, not hitting but by intellect.

22
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:49,299
They will not accept unless the man knows how to handle such a woman without experience.

23
00:05:50,460 --> 00:06:09,140
And the sensitive, artistic, observing individual who is hysterical, who does not learn how to handle erotic situations

24
00:06:09,141 --> 00:06:14,739
 eventually she falls in love with such a person.

25
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:25,190
You can understand the kind of life she will have.

26
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:34,929
Because she will observe all the time.
The observation is there all the time.

27
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:43,470
The critical mind is all the time right there.

28
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:54,179
 He assumes, he looks at you and can make a summary of you and say, this is good, this is bad.

29
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,909
Because she has learned to observe.

30
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:15,529
That is why Kent in his Materia Medica, in the end of his lecture he says, when you take the case of an Ign...

31
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:37,489
...finish as quickly as possible the interview, look wise, don't talk much, give the remedy and go.

32
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:51,690
Because he has realized once you start talking, Ign. will be assuming, 'he is like this, he is not like this....'

33
00:07:52,140 --> 00:08:01,889
 and he had realized how much he was criticized by Ign. people.

34
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:30,880
This is true but we have to understand in depth that kind of constitution, which is a person who has been trying

35
00:08:30,881 --> 00:08:37,559
all along to keep her emotions in control.

36
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:53,100
Because she knows there is a feeling inside Ign., that once she will let all her emotions out, she can be

37
00:08:53,101 --> 00:09:03,119
behaving in a ridiculous way. So she
 tries to control her emotions. How?

38
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:16,089
 By mental effort but the effort of controlling emotions passes through the thyroid gland.

39
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:29,499
And she feels this constriction. You say, 'do you feel a constriction in your neck?', 'Yes, I have this constriction'.

40
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:43,840
The constriction is nothing else but the effort that emotions will stay on this part and will not become

41
00:09:43,841 --> 00:09:49,769
aware and overtake the individual.

42
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:58,289
The emotions should not overtake, this is the biggest struggle.

43
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:13,640
In the Repertory we have a rubric it says, 'silent grief'. Ign. is there, Nat-m. etc.

44
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:27,659
Silent grief means 'I will not show to the other people how much I suffer. I must not show how much I suffer'.

45
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:41,469
Of course this is stupid but she does not know it is stupid. Her concept is 'I must not look ridiculous'.

46
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:56,970
And the moment you take her case, for instance you touch upon the real painful spot and immediately

47
00:10:56,971 --> 00:11:05,689
 you see she will try to swallow it.

48
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:13,930
Not like other remedies that will cry immediately.

49
00:11:13,931 --> 00:11:32,319
Ign., she will try even if you touch this very painful spot, she will try to control herself and not show you what is going on.

50
00:11:44,330 --> 00:12:02,480
In children where the parents are fighting and the child perceives this fight, that something wrong is between the parents

51
00:12:02,481 --> 00:12:05,989
 what the child Ign. will do?

52
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:12,960
It's so much the pain that she cannot react.

53
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:33,319
 She is paralyzed, she will keep inside silent grief and the parents they don't even understand what is going with the child.

54
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:38,489
They don't perceive that the child is in a state of grief.

55
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:59,750
That is why we say that with Ign. we have a hysterical element which affects the nervous system

56
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:08,259
and therefore we will have nervous system affections.

57
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:31,280
You have epilepsy, you have nervous system affections and the element of hysteria is there. That means once

58
00:13:31,281 --> 00:13:37,509
they let themselves to have convulsions, they will overdo it.

59
00:13:41,600 --> 00:14:01,069
There is an exaggeration. In the same way if they let their emotions out, they become really ridiculous.

60
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:13,619
They overdo it to the extent that the other person may even get frightened with the reaction they have.

61
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:20,049
Because they are not used in such overwhelming reaction.

62
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:53,520
There is such a change which is imprinted upon the organism after an emotional stress and the weak point of Ign.

63
00:14:53,521 --> 00:15:02,399
is not money, not profession, not position in society.

64
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:15,019
The weak point is those she loves, the idea that she may lose them. This is the weak point of Ign.

65
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:24,489
Emotional attachment that was never revealed to the other person.

66
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:34,059
They don't have the possibility, the Ign's, to go and say 'My father! how are you?'. Kiss the father, kiss the mother...

67
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:41,370
They don't have that possibility. They are observing, their emotions are there, very powerful

68
00:15:41,371 --> 00:15:51,549
but they will not let them out. Maybe I become ridiculous if I let my emotions. This is the idea.

69
00:15:52,590 --> 00:16:01,759
So the moment they lose this, that destroys it, they cannot control it anymore.

70
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:11,090
And then the organism takes all the impact and then the disease starts.

71
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:15,639
Whatever is the predisposition in the organism.

72
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:31,590
They go into a state where they don't want to talk to anybody, they don't want to be consoled by anybody.

73
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:41,639
They feel that they are responsible and they, themselves must get out of this situation.

74
00:16:50,150 --> 00:17:01,900
And with this grief there is a peculiar thing that comes in the organism. I cannot explain it with physiology

75
00:17:01,901 --> 00:17:08,219
but this is definite and it is a point on which you can rely.

76
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:20,380
With the grief, with the silence, with keeping the emotions inside, with retraction of the person, he goes and closes himself

77
00:17:20,381 --> 00:17:27,520
 comes an aversion to fruits.
They don't like fruits anymore.

78
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:42,459
It is the beginning of a deep disturbance
 that will show itself after a few years.

79
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:54,140
Because fruits have certain vitamins and since the organism is producing these vitamins in excess

80
00:17:54,620 --> 00:18:03,979
but producing excess in losing something else.
 I don't know the physiology, I can't explain it but this is a fact.

81
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:13,409
And little things like 'do you like fruits?', 'No, I don't'. 'Since when?', 'Since two years?', 'What happened in two years'?

82
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:18,569
Then you become a prophet and say,
 how did he know Vithoulkas?

83
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:27,900
I said 'two year ago this happened'. He said 'yes' of course because I know the situation when this happens

84
00:18:27,901 --> 00:18:33,399
something had affected the organism deeply.

85
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:39,948
And then I become a prophet, this is not a prophecy, this is mathematics.

86
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:47,049
Just because I know certain information
which comes from the Materia Medica.

87
00:18:50,620 --> 00:19:02,880
These people are sensitive people and it is a wonderful thing also to see that sometimes where externally

88
00:19:02,881 --> 00:19:12,210
you may have somebody who is quite strong or things like this but internally there is the element of weakness

89
00:19:12,211 --> 00:19:14,999
on the emotional level.

90
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:32,169
Now how come that most of us we become
 Ign's when we lose somebody we love?

91
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:51,029
It is one of the weakness of the human
race. We don't see this in the animals.

92
00:19:53,530 --> 00:20:04,770
There is a cat and she has 3 kittens, you take the kittens away and the cat has no problem, she is happy.

93
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:11,039
The same with dogs.

94
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:26,219
From humans you take the children and see what happens.

95
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:38,070
Therefore we have, all of us, the privilege of being attached and we have the privilege to be happy

96
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:40,499
 because of this attachment.

97
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:49,849
When you take away the child, it dies, accident...

98
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:57,829
then the pain is unbearable and we have
 the development of diseases after that.

99
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,740
My child! Why?

100
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:18,860
Because of the attachment, because it was given you pleasure. When you are attached to somebody

101
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:22,960
you get pleasurey ou enjoy yourself.

102
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:33,299
So when you lose this, you are going into hell, from paradise.

103
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:43,460
From the paradise of living in an exalted, ecstatic way.

104
00:21:50,070 --> 00:22:10,960
In Ign. because of this hysterical element, we call it hysterical, it's an excessive sensitivity of the nervous system

105
00:22:10,961 --> 00:22:17,869
that can be stimulated.

106
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:31,579
In Ign. the brain in certain areas can be stimulated to a great extent and can live very ecstatic moments.

107
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:43,899
The more the moments of ecstasy, the worse will be the time when she will be in grief. They want to kill themselves.

108
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,339
Usually they don't, they think all this but they don't do it.

109
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:13,209
They may think, 'my life is finished,
I don't want to have anymore anything'.

110
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:28,329
The experience of Ign. is so painful that at a certain moment they decide 'I'll never let myself again be in love'.

111
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:45,390
The moment they make this decision, in the organism there is a deadening of an area in the brain

112
00:23:45,391 --> 00:23:56,259
in the amygdale or wherever the emotions are sitting. It's like a calcification of the area.

113
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:02,190
Closed, finished.

114
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:19,850
The emotions were closed but what was the chain effect that this closing of emotions had on the organism?

115
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:30,839
The ovaries are big, the uterus becomes bigger, the heart is affected...

116
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:48,079
and then they come with this problem and you give the remedy and then the organism tries to rejuvenate itself.

117
00:24:48,080 --> 00:25:02,839
And there is really a struggle, it's not easy, once this calcification has taken place of the emotional part.

118
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:26,520
If you manage to give a stimulation to the immune system, the emotions may be coming back

119
00:25:26,521 --> 00:25:37,039
maybe being alive again and then
 all the consequences will manifest.

120
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:50,120
What are the consequences? A series of side-effects which we call aggravation or bringing back old symptoms.
