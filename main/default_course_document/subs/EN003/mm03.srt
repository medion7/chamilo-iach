1
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:45,258
Here in Aconitum you see, fear of death and feeling that death is imminent or near.

2
00:00:45,330 --> 00:01:03,640
Death is near, any case whether it is a colitis, an acute condition, a chronic condition of any kind, once he has the fear of death

3
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:18,778
and that death is very near: I'm going to die tomorrow, in 3 days, in 3 months, once there is this element

4
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:31,328
you will have to think of Aconite, agonizing fear of death. The fear of death brings agony.

5
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:44,908
You will ask a case, do you have fear of death, they will say, yes I am afraid of death.

6
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:50,408
If they say it like this, this is not an Aconite condition.

7
00:01:51,740 --> 00:02:06,068
If the answer is 'yes my god I'm terrified!' then your mind should go to Aconite.

8
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:20,050
If on the top they will say, 'that not only I'm afraid but I'm afraid that I will die soon', this is more of an Aconite condition.

9
00:02:20,122 --> 00:02:26,240
Never mind what is the problem.

10
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:59,328
Panic states, intense panic which has sudden, violent palpitations, red face, one sided numbness,

11
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:24,950
faint feeling, perspiration, trembling, vertigo, dyspnoea, fear of death. All these symptoms are symptoms which arise from

12
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:41,328
a shock that a person has had while his life was threatened, that means he was closed in a lift.

13
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:58,168
And he felt I'm going to die now, I suffocate, I am here enclosed. He found himself in an accident, threatened by a pistol.

14
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:10,618
That state which is created in such a situation, if it repeats itself again and again and again or if that state

15
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:25,928
that you can imagine how the person behaves under the threat of death if that state appears in any condition

16
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,160
that is an Aconite state.

17
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:46,080
- Could I ask you if this fear of death has to be for themselves or can also cover a fear of death , for instance saying,

18
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,808
 I don't wish to die because I don't know what will happen to my children, of if I die I don't know

19
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:57,020
how my parents will handle that or is it an individual fear of death.

20
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:02,328
-No, the shock has to threaten his own life.

21
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:24,048
And it says, acute symptoms arising from exposure to dry, cold winds. Another causative factor is dry, cold winds bring about

22
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:32,510
violent palpitation, red face, one sided numbness, faint feeling, perspiration,  fear of death.

23
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:57,440
-Can this state be caused by watching a threatening situation?

24
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:18,258
-Threatening, yes. This can be caused by watching a threatening situation, by watching some scene under which

25
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:33,300
the life is threatened, by a robbery, this situation can arise. But the idea is that it does not have to arise always from that cause.

26
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:42,688
I'm just giving you the idea to show you how the person feels, I'm going to die.

27
00:06:42,760 --> 00:07:01,850
When somebody puts a pistol, in 2-3 minutes you are dead, right? It's finished, my life is gone.

28
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:16,448
You don't have to have the real fact that this person was threatened. What you have to have is the result of such action.

29
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,808
How a person feels when somebody puts a pistol.

30
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:31,848
It may never happen to this person but the idea is the same, the symptomatology of Aconitum is the same.

31
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:43,450
I'm going to die, I'm going to die! I'm dying!

32
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:59,928
Palpitation, restlessness. This panic states, nobody can live constantly in such panic states,

33
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:12,048
It is like a wave. It comes and then it goes
and then the person is calm.

34
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:24,928
There is no problem, so panic states that come to great intensity and then they go. But when they come

35
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:36,848
these people need immediately attention. They are the people who will run to the emergency hospitals

36
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:44,258
to save their life because they feel
that their life is really in danger.

37
00:08:44,330 --> 00:09:01,518
In more chronic states you will see the same idea. If somebody tells you 'well I'm tormented by fear of dying

38
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:09,160
and I'm married and I have 2 children and I think I'm going to die and leave these children orphans'.

39
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:17,288
If somebody tells you something like this, immediately your mind goes to... because the question that you will have to

40
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:26,688
ask immediately is: do you feel that you are going to die soon?. 'Yes!'. This is Aconite.

41
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:33,008
'Yes, I think I'm going to die quite soon'. 'When?'. 'I don't know but quite soon'.

42
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:40,608
This is an Aconite. It does not matter what it is, you see?

43
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:20,728
And there are certain specific fears which are elevators, tunnels, fear that their heart will stop, fear of going in the airplane,

44
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:37,538
fear of earthquake, fear in a crowd, in narrow places all these situations are situations where a person feels his life is in danger.

45
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:46,778
If there is an earthquake here, you will immediately feel fear, right?

46
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:58,800
If any of you stays with this fear, in order to counteract this fear, Aconite is a specific remedy.

47
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:09,240
Ah, I'm going to die, again it comes, again it comes, Aconite.

48
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:24,460
Intense nervous restlessness, tossing
about intense thirst for cold water.

49
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:35,968
This anxiety state which causes restlessness, the person wants to move all the time, up and down.

50
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:51,488
 You don't need to remember anything else for Aconite but if you go to the Repertory you will see

51
00:11:51,560 --> 00:12:01,548
3.000 symptoms of course but you have to have this picture to prescribe Aconite. This is where your mind says,

52
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:16,108
when you see the patient, is this a case of Aconite? Immediately when you have that picture your mind will go to Aconite.

53
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:29,870
That reminds me something, Georges was taking about. What? Aconite. You know it comes like this.

54
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:44,608
Closed in an elevator, ah I can't go in an elevator. Why? I feel I suffocate, I feel I will die. Possible Aconite.

55
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:55,170
Fear of death? Yes. How strong? Strong. Yes. You feel that you're going to die soon? Yes. Aconite.

56
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:10,320
So learning in this way the Materia Medica it will be very easy to find the remedy.

57
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:21,788
-Your experience of having prescribed the Aconite in chronic disease, do you see there are people who

58
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,928
would be present these panic states in any pathology?

59
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:41,270
-In any pathology they can present this picture, this agonizing fear of death with the feeling that death is coming soon.

60
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:47,858
-But after you prescribed a remedy, let's say in 10M or 50M, and do you see that they're braced up in future

61
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:52,338
for the pathology or do they still presenting the same thing?

62
00:13:52,410 --> 00:14:03,840
-It doesn't. The fear of death subsides almost immediately and totally.

63
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,870
-For future reference also?
-Yes, for future reference also.

64
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:21,808
 You see you get these chronic cases of Aconite, it's beautiful to see how the whole syndrome

65
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:28,610
is counteracted and the person for years lives without problem.

66
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:56,738
The way I write what impresses you here? Two or three things, that's all you have to remember.

67
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:17,330
What impresses you? Fear of cancer, especially cancer. They are not afraid of fear of brain stroke, of heart disease,

68
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:29,488
everything is cancer. Everything is overwhelmed in this case with the fear that they have cancer.

69
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:42,400
The second is twitchings, spasms,
 convulsions, chorea. Twitchings.

70
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:59,858
So if you have fear of cancer and
 twichings the remedy is Agaricus.

71
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:06,848
 It doesn't matter what is the pathology,
 just two things and the remedy is here.

72
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:16,560
There is no other remedy that has this combination. The idea is the combination of 2-3 symptoms.

73
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:23,928
You get the combination correctly,
you get the remedy.

74
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:43,618
Now of course, you have the main thing which is fear of cancer but this fear of cancer will present to you,

75
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:51,708
it will be presented as something which the patient is really concerned, about his health.

76
00:16:51,780 --> 00:17:06,360
He will say this, this, that and he will end up with the fear of cancer. And then your mind will go to certain remedies,

77
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:15,468
one of which is Agaricus.
Next question: do you have twitchings?

78
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:30,598
  What is twitchings? Oh, yes. Where? Here, there. Your case is finished.

79
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:49,008
You will not believe that this is how I go about finding the remedies. Because I have this knowledge in my head,

80
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:55,428
I short out the remedy, I say, not this remedy, not that remedy.

81
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:08,158
Which is the remedy George which has tremendous fear of cancer? 1,2,3,4. Ok, I eliminate quickly.

82
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:19,088
Now, this person I found out, that they develop this kind of fear, this kind of anxiety.

83
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:34,108
They are patients with weak character, with weak will, there is no will. There is some kind of weakness

84
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:44,258
in their character, dependency. They depend
 and they depend mainly on the doctor.

85
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:54,668
 Because you do not get immediately the remedy, you don't give immediately Agaricus.

86
00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:03,928
When I started Homeopathy, I did not know Agaricus had that picture and I would prescribe Nitric acid

87
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,138
because it has anxiety about health. And I would prescribe Lyc., Phos., Ars., Kali-ars., Arg-n

88
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:26,608
and then one day I found out the twitchings
 and I said, wait a moment, Agaricus, finish.

89
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:35,568
In the meantime I had this patient for 2 years.
 For 2 years the patient is coming and going, Arg-n. a little better,

90
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:41,458
Phosphorus a little bit better, not really.

91
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:54,448
And the fear just to give an example of this kind of fear. I have seen it in a Medical doctor.

92
00:19:54,520 --> 00:20:07,888
He works in the hospital. So in the hospital, he sees a case. He takes this case. This is a cancer of the colon.

93
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:15,418
The patient relates that I had mucus in the stool with blood etc.

94
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:30,478
Immediately he thinks that he also has exactly the same symptoms. He would telephone and say, well I just took a case

95
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:42,298
and I saw a case with cancer and I feel I have the same symptoms. What is the same symptoms?

96
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:49,148
 Mucus in my stool and sometimes I have seen also some blood.

97
00:20:50,240 --> 00:21:00,918
And I said for so many years I treat you, you never told me about mucus. He is sure he has mucus in the stool

98
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:10,700
and he has blood in the stool and he now found the cancer, he has the cancer of the colon.

99
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:24,218
 One night he came in a panic state. He said, 'I'm getting crazy. I saw another case and this is....'

100
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:40,048
and then I saw doing this, in that state you
 know? His facial (muscles), they were torturing, chorea.

101
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:52,210
 He didn't have the chorea but I saw the activity on the nervous system with the muscles.

102
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:04,840
It's so terrifying, the fear is overwhelming.

103
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:12,618
He says, what shall I do? I'm finished,
my life is finished. I'm dying from cancer.

104
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,000
Agaricus CM.

105
00:22:22,072 --> 00:22:30,498
 I telephone next day and I said, how are you?

106
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:52,108
He says 'I don't know after this crisis I had last night, I decided that I should never again be influenced

107
00:22:52,180 --> 00:23:00,630
by patients and by all this kind of cancer and all this'. I said, good decision.

108
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:12,770
What is the remedy you gave me? I said, I will not tell you the remedy.

109
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:23,808
He used to call me once the day and three times the day 'I have cancer, I have cancer, I have cancer'.

110
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:37,928
Three times the day for two years, he was one of my students. I mean you cannot cure your student, it's very bad.

111
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:58,308
Finally I told him the remedy but for years now he has not telephoned once. Maybe he took the remedy himself, I don't know.

112
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:11,788
But to give you the idea of the intensity that there is no logic behind, there is no logic behind that fear. There is no control.

113
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:20,728
Of course, these are extreme cases, you may find less extreme but still you see the fear of cancer.

114
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:31,378
You see the activity on the nervous system and the muscular then immediately you put these two things together.

115
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:38,808
Now I try to describe in a word what I told you.

116
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:49,340
Their anxiety is such that they may drive you crazy with their complains that they may end up with cancer.

117
00:24:51,090 --> 00:25:10,008
I've seen another case, a woman is pressing
 her breast trying to find the cancer. She is sure she has cancer.

118
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:28,288
She presses and presses, one time maybe a little knob will appear after so many times pressing.

119
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:37,268
I mean if you press 20 times the day, most probably an inflammation will start and you will see something.

120
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:43,720
That is the kind of fear.

121
00:25:52,520 --> 00:26:12,218
 And there is a connection in their understanding between death and graves, funerals, grave yards

122
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:21,720
always connecting everything with death from cancer.

123
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:44,918
There is an element of....I will try to explain: how a person who looks something and says, now this looks to me like a grave.

124
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:58,408
The mind goes to the grave, she goes to bed and says, this looks like my grave I don't want to lie down here.

125
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:09,230
You laugh but the suffering is tremendous.

126
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:34,888
Better during sleep, in this nervous activity it is better when they lie down, the chorea stops when they sleep.

127
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:52,430
They will have no problems and worse
 from coition. Sexual intercourse.

128
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:18,488
If they have sexual intercourse,
afterwards they feel very bad.

129
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:31,528
So fear of cancer and worse after coition in general, this combination gives again Agaricus.

130
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:40,358
Pains that exhibited diagonally is another symptom that you have to remember.

131
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:51,900
Left shoulder, right hip, left elbow, right knee.

132
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:24,368
Children after chorea which develops after you punish a child. The child develops chorea, Agaricus.

133
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:31,778
What impresses us in this remedy? Involuntary or unnoticed stool on passing flatus, resulting in shame and irritability.

134
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:43,208
Little ones will drop all over the carpet, yellow drops of mucus and stool, you can imagine.

135
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:55,040
Dissatisfied and angry with themselves especially when the process of digestion starts.

136
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:20,400
Alternating states, hypochondriac, consider life a burden in the morning and in the evening they are content and happy.

137
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:38,208
What you have to remember here is that
they suffer after eating, when the process of digestion starts

138
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:44,360
that means 1/2 an hour, 1 hour after
eating they start suffering.

139
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:57,850
 If they have this symptom plus involuntary stool on passing flatus, the remedy is Aloe.

140
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:25,888
They feel very bad because they cannot retain, they don't have to pass real stool, it is some kind of liquid

141
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:34,050
or a little bit of liquid which makes the rectum always dirty.

142
00:32:54,040 --> 00:33:08,160
Diarrhea, 5-6 a.m. is a characteristic of
Aloe and also of another remedy, Sulphur.

143
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:29,408
 But these people they suffer this time, during
 the process of digestion and they have this

144
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:38,900
on passing flatus, they have involuntary stool.

145
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:18,928
They suffer usually with hemorrhoids which come out and they look like a bunch of grapes, ameliorated by cold bathing.

146
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:43,768
Cold applications in general ameliorate
 this remedy, whatever it might be.

147
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:53,448
 It might be a headache ameliorated by cold application. Hemorrhoids, ameliorated by cold application.

148
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:58,360
It might be a pain in the abdomen, ameliorated by cold application.

149
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:16,590
Which is another remedy which
is ameliorated by cold application?

150
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:40,160
Ledum and Pulsatilla. Pulsatilla is a warm remedy. This is not a warm remedy; it doesn't have to be a warm remedy.

151
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:59,490
It has to have digestive problems with hemorrhoids and amelioration with cold applications.

152
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:30,320
Headache across forehead
ameliorated by cold application.

153
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:55,080
 Lumbago alternating with headache and hemorrhoids is typical, esp. lumbago alternating with hemorrhoids.

154
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:07,018
They have pain here and then the pain
goes away and hemorrhoids appear

155
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:17,320
and the hemorrhoids go back and
 the pain in the waist comes back.

156
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:33,328
Mental symptoms of Aloe are not pronounced as to differentiate. They are people who are weary

157
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:47,808
people who do not have the joy of life who are anxious about their healthy with a hypochondriac tendency.

158
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:59,288
All the time dealing with their stool, with their digestion, I do not have good digestion, you know this type.

159
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:12,768
What I want on that state is to remember a few things. If we go expand, expand, expand, in the end

160
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:21,518
you will not remember anything. What I want you is to grasp characteristics of each remedy

161
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:26,408
 so your mind will go there when you see these characteristics.

162
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:33,920
What I told you about hypochondriacal state is too many remedies which have that. And you will not be able to differentiate.

163
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:44,568
But if you see that, your mind immediately will differentiate. So I don't want you to have a lot of information at this stage.

164
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:58,528
If you learn that and make it your own, then you can add and build the different other symptomatology.

165
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:10,498
I give you the basis on which you can stand quite well and be able to treat most of your cases, not all.

166
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:15,760
Nobody can treat all of the cases in any case.

167
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:49,748
What makes you impressed? Slowness of body and mind, severe constipation and inactivity of rectum.

168
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:06,660
Slowness of body and mind.

169
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:19,898
Progressing into a state of paralysis, paralysis of rectum, of extremities paralysis of mind, of emotions, answers slowly,

170
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:24,308
  time passes very slowly for them confusion of mind, cannot express their feelings.

171
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:37,360
 This is a whole syndrome where you get a person who cannot express their symptoms.

172
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:52,648
They come in front of you and then they stay almost without being able to express how they feel.

173
00:40:52,720 --> 00:41:03,728
You say, how do you feel? And you see they make an effort to think how they feel. It is very difficult for them

174
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:25,068
the mind is very slow to express, to bring out. In the same way that the rectum is unable to bring out

175
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:32,068
to express, it is a feeling of paralysis.

176
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:49,198
Paralyzed feeling which ends up in actual paralysis sometimes. Alumina is indicated in Multiple Sclerosis

177
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:59,988
 is indicated in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Myopathy.

178
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:07,328
Severe constipation, inactivity of rectum
even soft stool requires great straining.

179
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:14,320
This is a very characteristic thing.

180
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:29,648
 No urging for many days, has to aid with the fingers. This is characteristic, the constipation is

181
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:37,428
so severe that they have to help with their fingers to bring out the stool.

182
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:55,328
In Alumina they come to you for severe constipation. You say, what do you have? Severe constipation.

183
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:59,038
 Then you ask, what else?

184
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:10,288
How do you feel? And then you see immediately that their mind is slow, not comprehending, you feel that

185
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:19,880
they don't understand the question. They stay and stare at you. They wait before answering.

186
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:35,398
And then this can go very far as to appear to have a mental case.

187
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:57,178
Mentally you feel they are retarded, very slow. They cannot answer, in answering they say 'am I speaking?'

188
00:43:57,250 --> 00:44:09,148
Can you imagine? You have to use your imagination with Materia Medica you have to use a lot your imagination.

189
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:25,088
How a person feels, that cannot think, cannot answer; tries very hard to express an idea, to bring out the stool

190
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:42,808
and then the idea comes and says who is talking now? Am I talking, they hear their voice and they don't realize that they are talking.

191
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:58,208
It's very difficult to perceive these things. You have to be really sensitive and imagine how a person can feel.

192
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:15,760
They feel like they are going crazy but it's not the fear of insanity which prevails but if the fear of insanity prevails

193
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:28,008
then the remedy is different. What prevails is the difficulty to express, to bring out; that prevails.

194
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:35,698
That is the whole issue with Alumina.

195
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:47,878
They have of course fear of insanity because in that state in which they are, it's natural to think that I'm going crazy.

196
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:58,838
But they are not bothered by it, the bothering is the difficulty to think, the slowness of mind.

197
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:08,548
Everything seems unreal, fear of knives, impulse to kill themselves when they see a knife of blood.

198
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:26,130
When they see a knife the idea comes, 'shall I, oh I'm afraid I will take it and kill myself or kill somebody'.

199
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:34,288
There is another remedy which has that, which one?

200
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:50,228
Mercury has that but Mercury shall it have constipation? No. Mercury will have salivation for instance.

201
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:54,288
The combination is different.

202
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:04,978
Here, we have constipation with the fear of knife and severe constipation, Alumina.

203
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:21,588
Dryness of mucus membranes and skin, itching without eruption.

204
00:47:45,980 --> 00:48:02,678
It's a dry person and see the peculiarity. Dryness of skin, dryness of mucus membranes, yet desire for dry food.

205
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:17,248
You will think that the person who has such dryness, would require a lot of liquid food.

206
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:21,748
No, they don't like it, they like the dry food.

207
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:44,518
They have an aversion and aggravation from potatoes. Itching without eruption also is a characteristic.

208
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:52,708
Dryness of skin, itching without eruption, constipation, Alumina.

209
00:48:52,780 --> 00:49:11,300
Itching without eruption, dryness if skin with difficulty to express ideas,  the state of slowness of the mind, Alumina.

210
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:30,760
And of course paralysis, M.S., Alzheimer.

211
00:49:30,832 --> 00:49:43,300
I mean you can understand we are describing a state of mind which is the beginning of Alzheimer's disease.

212
00:49:54,160 --> 00:50:03,808
 The idea is to pinpoint the pathology of each remedy. Where is the pathology?

213
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:09,528
 Around the mind
and what turn this pathology takes?

214
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:18,188
Around the digestive system and what
 modalities around the digestive system?

215
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:32,110
Within heart and what modalities? There are remedies which affect the heart, the guts, the stomach, the mind.

216
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:44,160
So what I'm trying to give you here is the primary seat of action of each remedy.

217
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:55,080
Mucus membranes, skin, dry mucus membranes, dryness of skin, dryness of mind.

218
00:50:57,070 --> 00:51:07,800
You see if the mind is liquid then it runs out. Which is the remedy who has liquid mind?

219
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:20,078
Lachesis, loquacity they cannot stop. The ideas come fast, like Coffea, Lachesis, Nux-vomica.

220
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:25,400
Now this, it's the opposite, dryness.

221
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:55,858
When somebody is dehydrated, tired in mind and body, they will go like that and you wait, they try to give you an answer.

222
00:51:55,930 --> 00:52:05,250
The same idea is with the stool they try
 very hard, nothing comes out.

223
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:11,600
They have energy. It's not a matter of great tiredness.

224
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:32,948
I don't intensify the idea of tiredness because all the remedies can be tired, all. But there are some remedies

225
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:40,848
on which we shall focus on the idea of tiredness. Alumina is not one of them.

226
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:55,640
Alumina has this dryness and difficulty of expulsion, of ideas, of stool etc.

227
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:17,140
I'm going to give you some cases which you will study and then, you can use your Repertory of course to get some ideas.

228
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:31,000
What mostly I want is if you can spot the main remedy that you would give first because of this information.

229
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:42,588
I want you to use this information and find out and you will tell me, in this case I would prescribe first that remedy.

230
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:49,668
Because these cases I'm going to give you are not typical of one remedy.

231
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:57,888
Usually they contain the possibility
 of 2, 3 or 4 remedies.

232
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:08,280
Which one you would give first and for what reason is very important, so we synchronize our thinking.

233
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:25,998
In order to solve such cases you need to remember this. That's why you will have to study today these remedies

234
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:33,520
read them again and again because on Wednesday when I will give you the cases

235
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:40,920
I will give you enough remedies,
maybe one of them will be.
