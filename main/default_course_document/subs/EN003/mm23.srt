1
00:00:34,347 --> 00:01:04,279
The Lyc. pathology is such that makes an individual to be open and extrovert and making a big appearance

2
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:18,559
but inwardly he feels not secure, he feels weak and especially when he is facing authorities in general.

3
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:40,179
They become coward. So you have this double face of the Lyc. where he will feel very much at ease and flamboyant

4
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:45,939
and making jokes, the big guy.

5
00:01:51,560 --> 00:02:04,839
Those people who are a little bit older, do you remember Mussolini? He was the dictator who makes a big speech

6
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,799
 and he was bloated always.

7
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:22,799
A lot of gas, like a balloon. There is no power behind.

8
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:40,559
And especially this appearance is in front of the other sex. A man who is a womanizer. Do you know what is a womanizer ?

9
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:53,399
Every woman falls for Lyc. This is the idea, this is what they love. They love the lack of responsibility.

10
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:13,919
They don't like to carry responsibility. Therefore they will act in such a way that their actions will carry no responsibility,

11
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:31,069
It's a men's remedy mostly. It's a man who loves very much to have one woman, one night and finish with her.

12
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:45,619
And then next time another woman, one night, two nights, no responsibility, no attachment, not real, deep relationship.

13
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:56,399
Not for Lyc. If it happens that they establish a relationship, they go into a family situation and then suddenly

14
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:04,589
they find themselves with a wife, two children and a lot of responsibilities.

15
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:20,589
They get really fearful inside and sometimes they leave even the family. Not all Lyc's leave the family but the idea is behind.

16
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:26,759
The idea that now I have so much, it will be too much for me.

17
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:35,029
So to have pleasure and not to have responsibility are important for them.

18
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:46,680
And that's why it is known to be the remedy
for men who are looking for one night stand.

19
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:54,599
They come to the office and you will see
 them flirting with your secretary there.

20
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:05,959
You have your secretary, usually is a young woman and they will be flirting, making themselves very big

21
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:11,849
and what's your telephone number and I'm this big guy.

22
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:24,859
When they enter inside, they have totally different attitude. They are afraid, coward.

23
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:50,269
I remember a case. I suspected this is a case of Lyc. He was a short man and then I asked the question 'are you coward?'

24
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:15,239
He said, 'ah! I will tell you a story so you make your own decision if I am coward'.

25
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:23,279
He said, 'I was in the Greek army and they were the rebels, the Communists and we were fighting the rebels in the woods

26
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:34,919
and he would belong to the army. He says, at one point we were encircled by the Communists and all the battalion

27
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,299
was captured, except me. He says, 'do you know why?'.

28
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:51,759
He said, 'when we found out that we were encircled, we all rushed to get away

29
00:06:51,760 --> 00:07:07,709
but we reached a place where there was a big ridge, a very big ridge, very deep and high, about 5 meters apart'.

30
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:21,959
He said, 'I had all the things we carry as a soldier and he says, can you imagine that I was the only one that out of fear

31
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:37,839
 I jumped from one place. The fear was so much that was impossible for me to stay. I jumped, nobody else did.

32
00:07:43,620 --> 00:08:03,919
I reached now the rest of the army and the colonel presented me, he said this is the hero who was not captured.

33
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:19,459
And I knew why I was not captured'. Just to give you an idea of the intensity of the cowardice, which is inside the Lyc.

34
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:36,859
But bloated the ego in front of the inferior. That's why I say dictator children who are dictators in their own house

35
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:46,079
they act like dictators. They go to school, what a nice boy. He never talks, he never does anything wrong.

36
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:55,939
He is very quite, he is very obedient. He goes back where he feels his power and then he becomes a dictator.

37
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:20,999
This remedy affects primarily the digestive system and affects the gallbladder and produces a lot of gas.

38
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:35,549
They wake up in the morning and they are bloated but their worse time is between 4 - 8 p.m.

39
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:47,199
This is a very well established symptom between 4 - 8 p.m. in the afternoon they feel rotten, they feel very bad

40
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:56,459
they feel low, depressed, bloated. They have no energy, they are irritable, they don't want to do anything

41
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,619
 their mind is not working.

42
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:10,029
The lungs are going wrong this time, the liver is going wrong this time etc.

43
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:28,889
It says here impotency due to sexual excesses. You imagine this man who tries to have this kind of relationship.

44
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:40,169
What happens is that he does not find anymore excitement unless it is something new.

45
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:51,139
They cannot be excited anymore so in the end when they are 35 they are going to marry. 36, 37, 38 they decide to marry

46
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:57,409
and 3 months after marriage they are totally impotent.

47
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:12,639
Or they will come to you and say, for the last 5 years I'm married, I do not have proper sexual intercourse with my wife.

48
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:24,909
Though they make like their wife, they are nice together but they cannot be excited sexually due to the fact that

49
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:41,479
 they have lived a life of superficial sex. Superficial sex is killing the desire and that's why the young people of today

50
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:51,019
very young people like 16,17,18,19, 20 they are impotent. Because of this reason.

51
00:11:51,020 --> 00:12:18,239
The sexual liberation allowed this generation to play with sex too much. At the age of 12,13 the girl must have a boyfriend

52
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:28,479
 at least in America. I don't know so much in Germany, probably not yet and Romania, you see she is feeling

53
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,179
 very embarrassed.
In Romania you don't have this kind of things.

54
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:48,849
But 12,13,14 they start. By the age of 19 they have lived everything. They know everything. They are fatal woman

55
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,039
who doesn't care about anything.

56
00:12:51,040 --> 00:13:05,359
In India on the contrary where man and woman are not allowed to have sex, 95% of the marriage, they stay.

57
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:12,379
Because they marry and for the first time the man the and woman have sex while they are married.

58
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:28,239
Such couples, such relationships are going to stay. But if one of them or two of them, have a lot of encounters before marriage

59
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:37,841
 they come to Lyc. and there are some other remedies. Impotency, indifference, they cannot be excited anymore.

60
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:48,759
 And the marriage is soon breaking down because each one tries to find a partner that will excite them again and again.

61
00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:06,319
So Lyc. together with Staph. and Agnus Castus are the 3 main remedies for impotency actually.

62
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:16,209
For different reasons each one of them. Lyc. we said for what reason they are impotent.

63
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:33,769
Staph., when we speak about it I will tell why Staph. becomes impotent.

64
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:46,270
Premature ejaculation, loss of erection during coition.

65
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,789
Why premature ejaculation, do you understand?

66
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:12,979
Because we said he is a womanizer, he gets therefore excited very much, in the first, second encounter

67
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:29,039
and then he cannot hold and there is orgasm very soon, before even the sexual act.

68
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:50,360
It is a remedy which is hungry at night. It's not so much. Appetite increases while eating.

69
00:15:52,080 --> 00:16:05,009
They sit down to eat, they eat a little bit and appetite is gone, that's one thing. Or they sit down to eat

70
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:12,779
no appetite and they start eating and appetite comes. So they have both.

71
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:28,159
Desire for sweets is quite strong and desire for warm drinks also is quite strong element for Lyc.

72
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:38,849
If you think he is a Lyc., for instance, and he says I have thirst for cold drinks, you think twice before you give it.

73
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:44,839
That point is quite important for Lyc.

74
00:16:48,170 --> 00:17:04,339
Another thing is emaciation of upper part of the body, they are emaciating here very much, losing flesh.

75
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:14,919
The bottom part becomes big and especially the belly.

76
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:24,159
It's bloated, mostly air, balloon.

77
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:46,919
You saw these strong wrinkles in her forehead? Lyc. is one of the remedies you will think when you have this

78
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:59,879
special kind of worry that produces this kind of wrinkles. Another very characteristic thing is heels cracked.

79
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:14,589
 The heels are dry and with big cracks without much pain. There is another remedy that has that, it's Calc-f.

80
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:42,519
One foot hot and the other cold, that is another peculiar symptom. In bed they touch the feet and one is cold the other is hot.

81
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:47,879
Very strange, they have it Puls. and Chel. also have that.

82
00:18:49,720 --> 00:19:03,939
Impossible to sleep on left side like Lach. Lach. and Lyc. and Phos. cannot sleep on left side.

83
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:22,639
-Are there special worries that makes this kind of wrinkles in the forehead? Do you know that ?

84
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:52,040
-I don't know. You see in fever especially the nostrils go in and out.

85
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:13,719
-Now we learn the Chel. and the Lyc. Do you think is now the time to learn the differential diagnosis between them?

86
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:32,719
-You must tell me. Aversion to cold drinks. Aversion for cheese, sometimes is also desire. Sometimes in the remedies

87
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:51,479
 you have polarities. For instance in Nat-m you have desire for salt and you have aversion to salt also.

88
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:05,469
So they get polarities. Sometimes I have seen Calc. with aversion to eggs.

89
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:19,319
It means disturbance of the calcium but taking a lot of calcium doesn't need more. It says, no, no calcium I don't need.

90
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:31,259
They have diarrhea and then they have constipation some other people.

91
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:47,199
Lyc. they need company. They are afraid of the dark, afraid to be alone in the house in the night, this cowardice.

92
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:02,029
The Israelis are correcting me, the Maltese are correcting me, the Germans are correcting me and here is the English

93
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:12,839
who is not correcting me. Let me hear it once from the original.

94
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:24,319
Cowardice. Did I say it correctly? Say it in the American way. Cowardice, but I will forget it.

95
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:30,079
If you get it wrongly from the beginning, forget it.

96
00:22:48,560 --> 00:23:04,169
A man 45, 50 stays in the house even little children are gone and he is alone. The mother took the children

97
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:10,193
and they are gone and he is going to sleep in the night. The night comes and...my God!

98
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:17,819
There is nobody in the house. It's not only that they are afraid of some spooky things

99
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:30,879
 they are also afraid of ghosts and things like that. But this is a feeling inside, I'm alone in the night.

100
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:45,640
 Not in my house where I live in the wilderness where you cannot see any house all around, but on a flat, on an apartment, next door.

101
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:53,719
Even if there is a child inside, they feel secure.

102
00:23:55,070 --> 00:24:02,539
As long as there is somebody in the next room, if the child is sleeping in the next room, they feel secure.

103
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:11,879
The moment they feel alone, that gives you the idea of cowardice.

104
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:28,889
Mostly they are afraid of the dark and being alone. They want company.

105
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:46,909
-You said it's mostly a men's remedy. I have two women Lyc. and they have fear of men, they are afraid of men.

106
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:56,509
-You see if you get a case like this or a case like that, special cases where women have been harassed

107
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:08,239
they have been raped, abused and things like that, especially these cases are terrible.

108
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:14,839
You cannot expect to have desire for men.

109
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:26,059
-I had a woman that it was so high, I put it in the computer 4 times, fear of men. She was very bloated and I gave her 200.

110
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:33,309
She said nothing changed and I said, we go to the computer again. I said, fear of men is still so high?

111
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:42,319
She said, no, no I have a boyfriend now. This is gone. In 4 weeks with Lyc.

112
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:58,279
-It is true that fear of men as you put fear of people, they are afraid of people. You have this symptom as a fear with Lyc.,

113
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:09,519
the same way as with Hyos., fear of people. But at the same time, they need somebody to rely upon, they have anxiety

114
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:18,119
about health, they are hypochondriacs. They can become so anxious about their health, totally hypochondriac.

115
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:39,379
Many times I have seen cases that they have much less symptoms than I have and they come to be treated.

116
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:56,879
I have a little pain in here, I say forget it. Live with this little pain here and there but the anxiety is so much that they cannot live

117
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:04,409
 it just simply is impossible for them to exist with this little bit of something.

118
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:27,129
There are a lot of differences. First of all the Chel. does not have this fear at all. These fears I mentioned, are not there.

119
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:40,159
On the contrary they are people down the earth without fears, having gallbladder problems but no bloated.

120
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:53,279
The problem is more inflammations of the gallbladder than the amount of bile that goes into the guts.

121
00:27:53,280 --> 00:28:08,019
Lyc. has a disturbance of the bile that is going into the colon and then you have the zymosis and then you have the bloatness.

122
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:27,609
With Chel. the effect is more on the gallbladder and the liver. They are not coward, they are not sexually driven.

123
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:31,359
Lyc. is sexually driven.

124
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,630
You cannot confuse them actually.

125
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:02,439
Lyc. after treatment is taking more responsibility or it will stay with that trait afterwards?

126
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:14,939
Yes he can take more responsibility. The fear is gone. Of course there is a special type of person who shuns responsibility

127
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:21,169
 to such an extent that he will just, one day, leave everything behind and disappear.

128
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:33,420
That is not going to change his character so much but they attain more self confidence.

129
00:29:33,421 --> 00:29:50,810
Underneath is a lack of self confidence. That the woman will say, bye, bye or that you are impotent or this or that.

130
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:28,289
 The Magnesias, the Chel., the Lyc. are affecting the digestive system primarily.

131
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:45,849
The Magnesias in general are people who do not like controversy, who do not like fighting.

132
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:55,040
They are the peace movement people, peace under any price.

133
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:03,560
 Mag-c. and Mag-m. have this trait.

134
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:18,739
We don't know how the gallbladder is affecting the guts. We say this person does not have guts

135
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:24,479
and the other day we say, he has gall, he has power.

136
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:34,480
Mag-c does not have. Another characteristic of this remedy is the body smells sour.

137
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:49,120
Another characteristic is that milk brings on diarrhea, makes the person worse, brings constipation, anything.

138
00:31:53,070 --> 00:32:00,210
Milk passes undigested.

139
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:12,249
Forsaken feeling, feels as if not loved by parents.

140
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:26,719
Children who feel they are forsaken. That means my mother loves better my brother. My father loves better my sister.

141
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:39,809
Who believe that, but they will not make a scene about that, will not fight to gain a position in the heart of the parents.

142
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,400
No controversy.

143
00:32:49,710 --> 00:33:03,809
 A great characteristic is that coryza starts before menses, the nose starts running the eyes start running as if she has a cold.

144
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:12,899
Then the menses go away and it's finished. That is just before menses, during menses and then, well.

145
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:18,380
If you have that, it's very characteristic.

146
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:30,030
Menses flow more profusely at night.

147
00:33:30,031 --> 00:33:43,589
While lying menses are flowing; when they are getting up and walk menses are retracting.

148
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:52,999
Craving for meat even in children is strong and aversion to vegetables.

149
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:00,880
They almost will say, 'never I eat vegetables, I'm not interested'.

150
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:16,839
Aversion to vegetables you think it's nothing but it's very important symptom because everybody eats vegetables

151
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:29,359
 like vegetables. If you find somebody who will say 'I never eat vegetables', then immediately your mind goes to Mag-c.

152
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:45,639
Unrefreshed sleep is common to all Magnesias, to Lyc. as well, to Lach. and Phos. Especially unrefreshing sleep

153
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:54,900
 is connected with misfunction of the liver. Misfunction of the liver makes you feel very unrefreshed in the morning.
