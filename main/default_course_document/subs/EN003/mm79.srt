1
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:32,419
We do some Materia Medica, one more remedy. Which is the next? Ah, it's Merc. yes.

2
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:38,399
It's good that we have to talk about Merc.

3
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:49,359
Excessive salivation, metallic taste and offensive breath are 3 symptoms that if you find is Merc.

4
00:00:54,990 --> 00:01:07,110
So we have apthae, gums are bleeding, profuse perspiration.

5
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,319
With every complain but not only does not relieve, it also aggravates the patient.

6
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:22,889
Now this is another point in which you
 have to ask to confirm Merc.

7
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:31,789
-Perspiration in German is correct.
-Sure, Germans are always correct.

8
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:40,200
Great weakness, pains worse on night,
worse both extremes of temperature.

9
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:54,279
Rapidly spreading ulcers... but I do not put here anything about the mental-emotional state of Merc.

10
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:00,599
So we shall be talking a little bit about the
 mental and emotional state of Merc.

11
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,789
Merc. is unpredictable.

12
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:17,679
It can go this way or that way. Merc. can
 go very fast up and very fast down.

13
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:31,479
You see how unpredictable he is when you try to hold the Merc.  it will go. It can go both extremes.

14
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:56,479
It's really a remedy which has a lot of anger inside and becomes introverted once they are hurt.

15
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:08,470
Once they are hurt, they close inside and they live only with their inner feelings and thoughts.

16
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:25,039
 They do not want to share things. And that is why they feel threatened by the environment because

17
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:35,349
the support, everybody has a support team, a support group around, it's broken down.

18
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:43,839
They come to the point where they feel that they are threatened very much by outside people.

19
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:54,599
They are so much threatened that they can reach even a delusion that everybody wants to do harm to them.

20
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,729
This is a reason why also they cannot express their emotions.

21
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:09,979
And because they cannot express their emotions, they start stammering.

22
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:22,139
Stammering with Merc. is a sweet stammering. It's not an aggressive stammering.

23
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:35,449
'I want to express my feelings but I cannot'. Sweet.

24
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:50,770
But the most interesting thing for the mental picture of Merc. is that this aggression that has been kept inside

25
00:04:50,771 --> 00:04:56,929
 it comes in waves as impulses to do violent things.

26
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:12,479
Suddenly it comes a wave and he described exactly that. There comes a wave and I just want to destroy everything.

27
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:27,029
And I want to do some violence and so much is strong this, that sometimes they say I need to go out and almost shout.

28
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:37,079
They try to keep themselves not
 to shout. Not to do violence.

29
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:45,909
There is a constant struggle, violence comes from inside and the struggle not to show it.

30
00:05:51,670 --> 00:06:15,419
So in this case apart from the symptoms which Merc. has, it has these core feelings of Merc.

31
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:21,479
The impulses to do violence but he has to resist.

32
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:40,009
Then if you put here one more symptom like, he feels everybody is his enemy, Merc. will shoot up.

33
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:49,639
Do you want me to show you how in this Repertory if you put the right symptom, you will get immediately Merc. first?

34
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:59,379
I will tell her to do that to show you that of course repertorization depends on what you are taking for repertorization.

35
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:09,620
And then if you take impulses then again Merc. will be...
