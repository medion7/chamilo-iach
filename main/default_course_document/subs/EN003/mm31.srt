1
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,160
It is a remedy which is excitable.

2
00:00:29,161 --> 00:00:49,469
Sensitive young girls, boys who are easily excited, easily expressing their excitement especially through dancing.

3
00:00:50,430 --> 00:01:00,719
  Movement always helps Sepia, whether it is in the first stage, where we have the excitement state

4
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:15,699
or whether it is on a second phase, where we have the collapse of the emotions collapse of the mind

5
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:27,479
collapse of the uterus, the intestines. Everything goes down, there is no stamina, there is stagnation.

6
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:36,569
Everything is heavy, the mind is heavy, the emotions are heavy, do not move.

7
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:50,219
And the people will complain that natural emotions that should be there, are not there anymore.

8
00:01:50,220 --> 00:02:01,520
What is a natural emotion? A natural emotion is to love your children. Even that is going away.

9
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:20,479
These situations will come out of shocks, out of traumatic experiences of the emotions.

10
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:38,999
The idea is that emotions, mind, sexual instinct, they all drop together with prolapses of the uterus

11
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:50,999
 prolapses of the intestines with a feeling that all the internal organs in the abdomen, will go out. All the time there is an

12
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:05,249
internal pressure, they feel that the internal organs will go out and that is why they will be better sitting, in what position?

13
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:17,990
Cross legged, they feel that supports better the feeling of the intestines.

14
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:43,419
Sepia is a remedy that you could say is pathologically detached from those she loves. There is no attachment really.

15
00:03:43,420 --> 00:04:00,680
These feelings of love which connect two people. Love connects two people, but if you say 'I'm detached'....

16
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:24,439
I have to say a few things to understand the feelings of Sepia. I have to analyze a little bit love.

17
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,610
We love our dogs.

18
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:46,709
 It means that we are attached to the dog. If there is attachment, there is no pleasure in love.

19
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:58,109
You love your wife, you are attached to your wife. Who can say I love my wife but if she feels she would like to go

20
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:02,599
 with another man, I would still love her.

21
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:13,129
The one who says that, is loving with detachment. Who can do that? Nobody.

22
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:39,119
Sepia cannot love. Who can do that? Only ideal people who have spiritually gone very far, where nobody can be there.

23
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:53,319
So love is a natural feeling but it contains within itself the possibility of pain.

24
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:05,559
So what is the most dangerous thing that you can do? It is to love with attachment.

25
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:17,789
That entails the possibility of pain in a very great degree.

26
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:33,789
Sepia understands that and she does not do it. She prefers to sit back and look detached upon a relationship.

27
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:39,520
Eventually she cannot love.

28
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:54,759
-My question is, Sepia understands it because she went through that experience of love which was

29
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,299
disappointing in a very severe way?

30
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:14,299
-Yes. Most probably the pathology of Sepia is formed in an individual who has been disappointed.

31
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:31,519
This excitable and sensitive individual came in contact with this stress and regresses back, collapses.

32
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:45,399
It's a collapse of the emotional level which has as a sequence the collapse of the three levels. The idea of collapse.

33
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:51,439
  The uterus loses its power of contraction.

34
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:03,639
When a woman has orgasm, there is contraction. Sepia cannot have the orgasm, there is no the power, there is no the desire.

35
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:49,169
Therefore it says enjoyment absent and to that extent it's connected; the hormonal system is affected.

36
00:08:50,380 --> 00:09:01,759
There are no hormones to stimulate and the organ collapses. You will see the uterus of a Sepia woman

37
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:13,719
 that it can protrude out from the vagina, you can see it from the vagina.

38
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:25,009
How many times you have seen this? None. The gynecologist sees it and the woman tells you.

39
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:36,559
I've never examined anybody physically. Say open this. You will be surprised about how much I know or you think I know.

40
00:09:51,210 --> 00:10:04,119
Because some rumors are going on especially in previous years, how George knows all this? From personal experience?

41
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:12,239
 It's not personal experience, from hearing the story.

42
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:26,600
And from observation but from far detached observation. Not attached observation.

43
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:42,729
-She is midwife, she is saying that she can assure this because several times she used Sepia and she remembers

44
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:49,209
one case of a Sepia woman after delivering her third child she had a prolapse of the uterus.

45
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:59,259
 She gave Sepia in 200 potency and all the symptoms came back nicely and the uterus involuted nicely again

46
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:07,580
 after giving the Sepia. She's never treated higher than 200. This is her experience she wanted to share.

47
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:25,839
Therefore Sepia will affect the emotions on this love level and will affect also the sexual organs, where love

48
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:31,839
 is expressed and in its more material form.

49
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:45,169
So Sepia loses the possibility to enjoy. There is no enjoyment, it is disinterested, no interest in life.

50
00:11:46,240 --> 00:12:06,719
The only thing that maybe makes her feel good is when she has to stimulate her organism to work fast and move the circulation.

51
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:24,909
Sepia would like jogging, some fast walking, fast movements, then instead of getting tired she feels more energy.

52
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:37,709
She says there is no energy and there is this heavy feeling, no feelings, no enjoyment, she says to the husband

53
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:49,719
forget it tonight I'm so tired. Next day she is tired, third day she is tired, 4th day tired, tired, one year tired, two years tired

54
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,439
she says let's go to a homeopath.

55
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:17,599
You see a beautiful woman and you think really hot stuff, she is going to be very ... then you enquire the husband

56
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,759
he says, forget it, nothing.

57
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:38,729
She will look like half asleep and things like that and you will think she is looking passionately at you.

58
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:55,959
She is sleeping actually, she is half asleep.
I'm terrible but I've seen these things and I've treated these cases

59
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:01,889
 and they have done well. The husband says, thank you very much.

60
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:31,079
What brings such a state is, I will tell you it's very interesting; Sepia condition of course comes from today's society easy.

61
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:44,349
The fear of having exposed yourself, you get the feedback and you finish and then you have a Sepia case.

62
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:54,349
But there is another type which develops Sepia symptomatology and which comes from young people of today.

63
00:14:54,350 --> 00:15:07,599
The young people of today because of doubting and searching for truth searching for spiritual awareness

64
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:18,589
searching for that which is the highest, which actually is secure.

65
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:40,519
They go to these spiritual people who are existing, especially from India and then they  hear 'you have to practice

66
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:52,319
abstinence and detachment', 'oh they say sex is very bad, I have to be detached'. And they try to be detached

67
00:15:52,320 --> 00:16:01,339
 and the more they try to be detached, the more Sepia state they bring upon themselves.

68
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:17,509
Detach, detach, don't have feelings, don't have sex, then they reach a state where they are without energy.

69
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:31,949
It says they drag themselves. Spiritual people who followed the guru, who followed an idea which never is going

70
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:52,469
to be fulfilled because this is not the way to ask for enlightenment. And these young people who have taken drugs,

71
00:16:52,470 --> 00:17:05,489
 who have destroyed their emotions and feelings, who have dealt very early with sexual matters 14,13, 16 years old

72
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:13,599
they go and have sex, 17 years old they don't feel anything. Then they search for god, then they search for truth

73
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:20,419
 then they search for the guru and the guru says, detach. He says, it's very easy to detach for me because I have no urge,

74
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:35,179
  no desires anymore, so it's OK. Then they bring themselves to the state of Sepia.

75
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:46,579
So it's very interesting for a homeopath to observe the creation of diseases, how diseases are created.

76
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:58,819
Out of 100 cases that you put inside there, 90% you ask when this disease has started and they will tell you

77
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:11,069
out of a traumatic experience, out of an inner conflict. And that inner conflict involves mostly the emotional side.

78
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:20,049
And then they can disease, they can progress, it can become from one stage to another. Eventually you may have

79
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:35,519
very deep pathology. Then you get the Sepia which has, I don't know physiology wise why it happens

80
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:50,229
instead of menses they have discharge, leucorrhea. They have menses but the menses are becoming less,

81
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:57,399
 premenstrual syndrome is very strong, before menses they are disturbed especially with depression

82
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:10,009
and irritability and a lot of discharges from the vagina. You get a little girl 12 years old, she hardly has started

83
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:21,239
her menses and she says leucorrhea constantly. This is 95% of the cases is Sepia case.

84
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:29,999
The leucorrhea, the discharge is yellowish-white.

85
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:55,729
So the dropping in the sex energy, in the feelings and in the intensity of the feelings and the dropping in the mental acuity

86
00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:02,039
 it points out to Sepia.

87
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:11,769
If you have of course a prolapsus somewhere in the intestines, that confirms it.

88
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:21,239
Better with strong exercise. That's another confirmation.

89
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:28,469
Leucorrhea in women, constant leucorrhea, a lot of leucorrhea another confirmation.

90
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:43,119
There is something else also that you see it very much in the literature and I have not seen it so much in practice.

91
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:56,719
The saddle around the nose. You know the lupus erythematosus creates a saddle around the nose and the cheeks.

92
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:13,479
 It creates a redness. In Sepia it can create a discoloration, a saddle,  they call it, on this area which is towards

93
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:20,609
 the yellowish but it can be also the redness of the lupus.

94
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:29,569
When it is red, Sepia is one of the remedies, when it is yellow, the remedy is Sepia.

95
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:47,319
Also these Sepia cases are very tired individuals. Tired physically, mentally, emotionally.

96
00:21:51,640 --> 00:22:03,169
A man who has been very active and then eventually becomes less and less active and less and less interested in sex.

97
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:19,239
In woman it arrives to aversion to sex. Anything to do with sexual matters makes her feel nauseous.

98
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:31,970
If she is married and during marriage she comes into a Sepia state, she has a terrible condition because she cannot handle it.

99
00:22:32,912 --> 00:22:42,409
The husband of course wants sex and she finally pretends etc. and it is a torture.

100
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:56,209
I have seen women who have pretended for years, Sepia women pretending for years that they are enjoying sex

101
00:22:56,210 --> 00:23:00,199
and they actually have aversion to sex.

102
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:19,849
'I cannot stand it', they say. If only caress, even that, caress I can stand it from the husband. But you put some

103
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:24,070
sexual connotation in the caressing...

104
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:35,760
If the caressing is fatherly it's OK.

105
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:50,949
  Another thing they have is of course, as I said before, the detachment makes them very acute observers.

106
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:09,339
You stay a little while with a Sepia case and she knows all your weak points. Then in the books it says, she is spiteful.

107
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:23,609
All people are spiteful. Sometimes if you touch them they will say something bad for you  but Sepia will find exactly

108
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:30,320
 the point where you feel the pain.
And she will hit you.

109
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:48,912
   Sepia is a cold remedy.

110
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:10,999
Of course the sadness and the depression of Sepia is of such indescribable matter, like she does not know what she likes.

111
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:20,659
There is nothing that she likes. That if it becomes deeper, then comes a state where without knowing why

112
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:26,319
 she cries and cries. And she does not know why she is crying.

113
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:35,559
But she will find a reason of course. My husband has left for a journey. The husband comes back.

114
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:46,059
My boy is going to go to the army. They find a reason. Why you cry? Because of a peculiar reason.

115
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:59,329
The idea is that unless they cry they feel that they have to commit suicide. Crying brings a kind of balance for Sepia.

116
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:11,239
Not all Sepias are like this. You have to understand the ideas.

117
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:29,679
You see in both Sepia cases that we had, you saw in the one case the sex is quite strong. I mean as a deeper remedy

118
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:38,839
you could say sex is quite strong. But sex is becoming less and less of a real issue.

119
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:45,369
   And in the second case sex has become out of question.

120
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:51,110
After Sepia sex is not going to be out of question.

121
00:26:55,530 --> 00:27:07,090
It will be freed of that frozen situation.
In women they call it frigidity, indifference to sex.

122
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:12,000
Fear of ghosts, of storms.

123
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:27,479
 Sepia actually can enjoy storms because Sepia can be stimulated by something which has intensity.

124
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:33,499
Because it is so difficult to move her. She will be stimulated.

125
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:44,319
And if you stimulate a Sepia case and she has an intellectual discussion, they feel better. The mind goes faster.

126
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:50,649
 The faster the mind, the better they feel. The faster the body, the better they feel.

127
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:57,290
 If you can stimulate their emotions also, they will feel very well.

128
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:02,939
Stimulate their emotions for a while and then the collapse comes.

129
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:13,279
Also it's one of the main remedies for having these empty feelings in the stomach, better eating.

130
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:25,849
But Sepia is not a big eater. Phosphorus is a big eater and Sulphur is a big eater and Iodine is a big eater.

131
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:32,139
And they feel better eating, Sepia is not a big eater but is better eating.

132
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:49,959
Kent has described the Sepia woman as a woman of very lean body like men's body without the pelvis.

133
00:28:49,960 --> 00:29:06,449
You know the natural woman pelvis to bear children is big. So women are bigger here. To be able to bear the children.

134
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:28,249
Sepia tend to be lean here, not to be really built up for bearing children. And that's why they have spontaneous abortions.

135
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:40,879
So a typical Sepia will have a difficulty bearing a child. In the 2nd month, 3rd, 4rth month the child is gone.

136
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:55,749
You give Sepia, she has five children. And then she curses because she says, I wanted only one.

137
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:14,009
It's a good remedy and quite frequently is indicated in the society today.

138
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:22,989
Who is a man Sepia, is anybody Sepia here?

139
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:53,719
-I was actually diagnosed as having systematic lupus erythematosus at one stage in my life. And Sepia was the first remedy

140
00:30:53,720 --> 00:31:04,829
that was prescribed for me. I also had this exanthema in my face as a butterfly which is known for lupus

141
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,079
 and this was really wonderful cure.

142
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:27,479
And it was prescribed for me because for years I had suffered from strong migraine headache, this was the leading symptom

143
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:31,319
 that actually led to the prescription of Sepia.

144
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:40,389
-Sepia has a left sided migraine over the left eye mostly. Where it was your headache?

145
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:53,809
-It was in the forehead.
-Not more in the one side or the other?
-No.

146
00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:09,319
-What I wanted to start saying is that this is described in the books, that you have such body but to find a typical Sepia

147
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:22,989
 like this is not so easy. Most of the Sepias will not be lean and thin like this. Most of the Sepias can be anybody.

148
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:34,489
You don't have to have this typical thin body with no hips.

149
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:49,699
-I learned in my homeopathic teaching in my school, where I went that Sepia has got the strongest

150
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:59,393
erotic appearance about it. They can be the most erotic people. For instance as described by Georges Bizet

151
00:32:59,493 --> 00:33:06,040
this figure of Carmen.  We learned that she was Sepia.

152
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:15,319
-Which Carmen, the opera?
-Yes.

153
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:26,199
-The woman.
-The main figure in Carmen was Sepia?

154
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,479
I don't know. Who said that?

155
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:50,081
-These are fantasies. I have started these many years ago in order to show examples, to take examples from different figures.

156
00:33:50,680 --> 00:34:02,449
I would say for instance Mussolini but I would support it with historical facts. Carmen had a lot of boyfriends.

157
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:22,199
Mussolini was a dictator but actually he was weak. He was a Lyc., he was bloated, he was egoist, he was womanizer.

158
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:33,319
All these are elements of Lyc. You can say, taken all these elements together this is an idea of Lyc.

159
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:49,189
I made this mistake in describing some people, known personalities. I said for the President of the USA.

160
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:21,839
I will describe to you and you will find it. A man with a face with a beard, Lincoln.

161
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:42,639
I said, he was philosophical, he was tall, lean, stoop shouldered, looks dirty and I said OK. And then I heard all my students

162
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:55,409
started describing the cases putting a lot of imagination like Carmen of Bizet is Sepia, no. I said before when

163
00:35:55,410 --> 00:36:04,039
I was describing you don't have to have a Sepia which is dry and lean and thin.

164
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:15,639
You may have Sepia who looks juicy and not dry and still it can be Sepia.

165
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,720
This is what I said.

166
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:40,249
-I have a Sepia woman that treated since March. She had bulgy eyes and it is a case I've never seen in the 7 years

167
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:48,321
 of my practice and I have it with me, I want to give it to my files. If you allow I can show it.

168
00:36:49,700 --> 00:37:00,939
The differential diagnosis to Apis was difficult. She had warts in the face and I decided in the end it was Sepia.

169
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:05,620
And it was gone in two weeks and she had it for two years.

170
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:22,620
30 of April and she came in March.

171
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:34,990
-Very good.
-We can show it on the camera.

172
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:49,079
-Yes, I don't think of practical matters, only women think of practical matters. It's very strange.

173
00:37:49,080 --> 00:38:05,399
 I said to my wife why is that if here is a table, so she puts the plate here. I don't push the plate here so I can eat.

174
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:10,620
I eat from there. Therefore I spill my food.

175
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:28,440
Why do I have to always do like this? It is so simple, it's very practical just pull this next to me and I can't think of that.

176
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:49,590
That is a very impressive picture. She got only Sepia?

177
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:30,440
Can you put your camera on and project the picture when she was treated?

178
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:15,469
You see the difference in her eyes. You see here the sadness and the anxiety, you see here the suffering in the soul?

179
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:20,829
Here there is some joy.

180
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:42,649
You see here she laughs but the eyes are showing emptiness and grief. On what symptoms did you prescribe Sepia?

181
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:50,839
-The warts on the face was one symptom but what made me decide Sepia was the red eyes, the burning

182
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:02,279
she had also rash in the nose when she came first.

183
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:12,519
She had prescriptions two years ago from the gynecologist for estrogen. She is 44 years old.

184
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:16,869
-What was the diagnosis for this case?

185
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:36,879
-The diagnosis was tiredness. She didn't like the grand children around her, she was dull.

186
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,199
-The allopathic diagnosis?

187
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:53,049
-I don't know. She went to several doctors, to dermatologist.
-What did they say?

188
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:59,449
-The dermatologist said, did they ever check your kidneys? That's what he asked her.

189
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:08,319
I said, were your kidneys checked? She said, never. I did nothing with the diagnosis of the school medicine

190
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:13,079
and I gave her Sepia.

191
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:29,169
-What is impressive here is the amelioration on the emotional level. Here is a woman who suffered a lot.

192
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:32,239
Did you ask her about sex?

193
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:39,000
-Yes she said that she has no sex, she has dry vagina.

194
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:58,519
With this picture she said, 'when I wake up in the morning and my husband wakes up, he only reaches out

195
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:04,009
with his arm and tries to touch my eyes to see if this is back'.

196
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:13,759
- How long? In one and a half month?

197
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,599
-One and a half month.

198
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:38,369
-You see the problem is that in your whole practice you will never see a similar case again.

199
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:45,840
Every time you have to individualize and you have to come back to the basics.

200
00:44:45,841 --> 00:44:59,340
Otherwise you expect to find a case like this, forget it. And most probably if we do find it will be Kali-c. or Apis.

201
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:14,509
Apis here is the remedy you look, you say Apis. Unless you take the symptoms and you find out, Apis is so sexual

202
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:18,269
and here she is not looking sexual.

203
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:33,439
-I wish to ask you if it's possible to have Sepia also without irritability and without premenstrual syndrome

204
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,919
or menses problems?

205
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:49,289
-Yes sure. There is no symptom almost in the Materia Medica which says this symptom will exclude the remedy.

206
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:51,630
There is no symptom.

207
00:45:51,631 --> 00:46:05,369
Even they will get sometimes where you will even have a cold remedy will be better by a hot remedy.

208
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:16,209
So there is no symptom that you can say if you are hot, you are excluded from these cold remedies. No.

209
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:40,529
The time of amelioration for Sepia is evening time. Evening time instead of being more tired, Sepia feels better.

210
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:46,009
Actually after moving around, she feels better.

211
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:23,979
The idea of Rhus-t. is that somebody who is stiff, what he wants to do?

212
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:27,799
He wants to move all the time.

213
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:46,699
-Can we give some feminine practical advice? Just an advice for this heat.

214
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:49,729
-What do you mean?

215
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:57,359
-Just for now, can I?
-Yes.

216
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:09,959
-OK. Everybody has the papers of this. They can hold it, you know it anyway. We can open the window and enjoy the class.

217
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:29,839
-Master of ceremonies, what do you say? No. The windows is better to have this because sun will come in and kill you.

218
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:40,399
That sun is very warm. In this weather he feels best, 'don't open the window, I feel comfortable'.

219
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:49,920
If a Rhus-t. is sitting there will have the window closed.

220
00:48:52,160 --> 00:49:01,479
 I feel comfortable. Why? Because Rhus-t. is always better with heat.

221
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:08,620
General heat and application of heat in the different parts.

222
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:20,119
The main points are worse cold, better heat, worse what weather?

223
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:30,899
That which brings the stiffness, the rheumatic stiffness, especially in the cervical region.

224
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:39,639
You have seen me doing all this time like this? It is because I need Rhus-t.

225
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:55,760
All the time you see them doing like this. It cracks.

226
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:05,760
 And the back.

227
00:50:07,053 --> 00:50:19,069
 They have to move all the time lumbago and cervical region is very prominent symptomatology.

228
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:31,309
And there is what we call restlessness. You cannot see them sitting, there is a restlessness of the mind

229
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:39,740
 restlessness of the emotions always.
The emotions are playful.

230
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:52,479
There is a boy's attitude. It's stiff and yet agile. How is that? You don't know.

231
00:50:52,520 --> 00:51:01,519
They get stiff very easily. The moment a draft is open, they fell it immediately either in cervical region or here.

232
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,609
They're stiff and they have to move.

233
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:12,439
They go to bed with a lumbago. They cannot stay in one place. The moment they are staying in one place

234
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:27,839
 one minute they have to move to another side, they turn. The restlessness on the lower limbs are very strong.

235
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:35,289
So you go to the bed side of somebody, you see he is sitting quietly, forget Rhus-t.

236
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:50,819
Even in the most severe pain Rhus-t. would love to move a little bit. And you see the more the pain, the less the movement

237
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:54,409
but the movement is there.

238
00:51:55,160 --> 00:52:03,600
If you observe the body is moving all the time. It says if you stop, I will grab you.

239
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:35,320
Stiffness all over the body, especially the joints.

240
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:56,639
Desire for milk is a keynote I can tell you, an invaluable keynote. This strong desire for milk. We mean from 3-6 lt. the day.

241
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:24,079
It says '5 lt. I can drink constantly. If I was not afraid of cholesterol, I could drink 5 lt. a day'. There is no stop for this milk.

242
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:33,930
And that is a keynote which is absolutely 100%.

243
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:58,329
Not acute, in a chronic condition. You have kidney problems, asthma, arthritic conditions, skin eruptions.

244
00:53:58,330 --> 00:54:14,799
Skin eruptions which are better with warm and better from heat and restlessness.

245
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:35,259
You cannot imagine the itching of Rhus-t., scratching and turning, scratching and turning, the whole night

246
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:47,329
may go scratching and turning. And if you suppress this, then the restlessness will come in the mind

247
00:54:47,330 --> 00:54:58,320
and it will not allow him to sleep, though not itching anymore, he cannot sleep, restlessness and sleeplessness.
