1
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:28,199
We will talk about the last big remedy which is Sulph.

2
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,600
Everybody knows Sulph.

3
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:53,760
Tall, stoop shouldered, philosophical...

4
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:10,640
This is a type which you will see sometimes
 not frequently in your practice.

5
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:24,389
 This description is very nice but you will not see it in your practice, very seldom you get this idea.

6
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:35,889
What you will see in your practice really which will be very frequent, it will be the sloppiness of Sulph.

7
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:41,649
Sulph. is one of the most sloppy.

8
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:58,569
This is almost in 90% of the cases. 90% of the cases are sloppy but in a way which is impressive

9
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:12,449
because everything in the room of such person looks dirty, absolutely dirty, as if nobody has ever gone in the room

10
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:29,599
 to clean it, the books, the papers, the rags, the food, you can open  the bag of a Sulph. case and you will see in the bag

11
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:38,519
the Organon, the notes, cutting papers and plus his breakfast.

12
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:51,279
And therefore of course the butter has gone into the notes, the marmalade has gone into the Organon

13
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:58,449
and you get this idea, you look and you say, my god.

14
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:12,039
And he knows exactly where everything is out of this chaos, he knows exactly where it is, in that corner of the house

15
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:21,999
 is lying the second edition of the Organon. He will go and pick it up. People many times have described the room

16
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:35,180
of a Sulph., they say, we cannot walk through the room because you have to go like this, there is one empty little space...

17
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:50,480
Why is like this? Because we say he is theorizing. What is theorizing?

18
00:03:51,160 --> 00:04:02,639
Actually it's not always theorizing. It is the idea I want to find out, the idea behind Sulph. is I want to know why.

19
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:16,910
So he takes that book, oh there is an interesting book concerning the energies of the cosmos.

20
00:04:16,911 --> 00:04:20,749
He will go, grab it and start reading it.

21
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:32,229
There is another book which says how seed grows, the mechanism, he will grab it and he takes it

22
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:38,969
 he reads it but once he reads it, then he puts it somewhere. There is no order.

23
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:53,239
This theorizing is without order, without system. This becomes the pathology of Sulph. in the same way

24
00:04:53,240 --> 00:05:06,719
 that the absolute organization of Ars. where everything is clean, meticulously put is again the opposite pathology.

25
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:20,959
I have heard saying 'I wish I could stand
some dirt'. The Ars. will say, 'I can't'.

26
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:31,219
There is a little piece here, they have to clean it, take it out, take the broom as to be everything meticulous.

27
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:38,039
Now you can imagine what happens
when a Sulph. and Ars. get married.

28
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,049
It is a disaster!

29
00:05:51,630 --> 00:06:03,599
The Sulph. will try because he loves his wife, will try to be organized and then he forgets, he goes inside the room

30
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:18,639
his feet are full of dirt and goes inside and the
 dirt goes inside, 'oh my god!' but it's too late. The wife is already behind.

31
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:38,520
And Sulph. of course is also very critical. You see there is a critical faculty over critical, criticizing everything.

32
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:50,900
'This course is no good, this man is not nice, this person is not so....'

33
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:04,909
 Something brings him to the point where he has to criticize.

34
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:13,939
When he becomes a nuisance for others because if you are critical all the time, then they cannot stand you.

35
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:23,280
But this critical faculty, this idea of
 theorizing and trying to understand why.

36
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,729
Unbelievable questions they have in
 their mind. They create questions.

37
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:41,199
Questions that never strike your mind.
It will come to the mind of a Sulph. case.

38
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:56,879
You see a scientist who is like this, sloppy and dirty and not caring about any kind of cleanliness.

39
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:13,689
Yet it's very strange, such a person goes to a friend to eat and they are disgusted because the plates are not clean

40
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:28,239
or the glasses are not clean. He feels disgusted and may not eat. He will say 'I'm not hungry'.

41
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:45,539
Disgust is one of the main symptoms of
Sulph. as well as their tolerance for dirt.

42
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:53,779
The tolerance for their own dirt, in their own bodies and in their own surrounding is unbelievable.

43
00:08:53,780 --> 00:09:01,350
Sometimes of course Sulph. has discharges which are offensive.

44
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:13,639
 All the discharges are offensive, the perspiration, the menses, the discharge, the eczemas which they develop they are offensive.

45
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:20,849
And sometimes they are bothered by this offensiveness themselves.

46
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:30,479
Because they do not have time to wash, in their mind there is no time, it's a waste of time.

47
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:38,510
You just go to the bathroom and prepare the bathroom and start cleaning, all this it's a ceremony

48
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:46,330
not understood by Sulph. So what they do,
they wash locally.

49
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:58,179
They wash quickly locally a little bit and then they are going, 'I'm clean now. It's OK I don't need more

50
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:06,479
what's the problem? The main problem is that we have to discuss a philosophical matter', this is very important.

51
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:21,199
You tell Sulph. we're going to have philosophical discussions about finding the truth, they get very excited.

52
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:28,690
They will come and stay and discuss and put ideas forward etc.

53
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:46,929
The scientists, as I said, are so sloppy and if you go to more gross inventors like 'I'm going to invent an electric car'

54
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:55,724
you go to his workshop, the workshop is really in a mess, it's really dirty.

55
00:10:55,824 --> 00:11:01,159
He, himself is always dirty. This is the idea of Sulph.

56
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:12,699
And then the organism gets a lot of heat and the heat is especially where? We said already, on top and on the soles.

57
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,179
These are typical Sulph. of course.

58
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:25,050
When we discuss about this, we're talking about a typical Sulph.

59
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:36,079
That means a Sulph. which is going to make a big difference.

60
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:42,930
The person is going to clean up its place, he finds the energy. Also there is no energy.

61
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:47,199
He says, I don't have the energy, I will clean it.

62
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:57,759
So one day it's so dirty, he has to put order. He starts putting some order a few hours, then it's finished. Then again next year.

63
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:07,609
Once the year he will put some order, this is the idea of Sulph.

64
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:17,549
And then because their system, they need energy, they need heat, they need also to take sweets.

65
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:30,569
They don't care about the consequences, they are totally oblivious until the time when they will have some real problem.

66
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:39,739
Then the anxiety about health of Sulph. starts and becomes very strong.

67
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:55,120
They are becoming hypochondriac.

68
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:09,959
'Doctor, examine me here, I feel something inside here'. It's OK, nothing.

69
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:19,010
They come next time and say, 'examine me there, now it's here definitely' and then you get this idea of anxiety

70
00:13:19,011 --> 00:13:22,409
 developing more and more.

71
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:33,350
Another keynote for Sulph. is that they need food. They burn out the food. They need a lot.

72
00:13:33,351 --> 00:13:41,719
Sometimes they get up in the night and they have to eat and the feeling of emptiness comes at about

73
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:51,120
11,12,1 o'clock around that time. It's an empty feeling and they have to eat something immediately.

74
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:59,060
They go to the house, if they are in the house and the wife says, OK wait half an hour to prepare something.

75
00:13:59,061 --> 00:14:06,779
He says, no, no, he grabs something to eat quickly and then he can eat two hours later.

76
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:14,289
Just to fill up this empty feeling which they feel.

77
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:28,129
In their desires and aversions we have primarily desire for sweets and aversion to two things, fish and eggs.

78
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:35,639
Fish and eggs they will almost never desire to eat.

79
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:52,370
Aversion to fat it's written here, it's very seldom to have aversion to fat. The desire for fat is strong.

80
00:14:52,730 --> 00:15:02,919
They eat fatty food, food that contains calories to burn.

81
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,480
Amelioration by cold bathing, this is not correct.

82
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:26,519
In the books they are written like this. Actually what you get is an aggravation from cold bathing.

83
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:34,919
Especially if they are having some eruptions.

84
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:57,929
Sulph. is one of the main remedies for eruptions with one characteristic. They have itching which is voluptuous

85
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:13,689
 It's pleasurable itching. They scratch and scratch and it's so pleasurable that a monk will think this is a sin.

86
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:25,239
Such pleasure.

87
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:40,040
Actually this is a case I had in a monastery. It is a very saintly man, he said I had to scratch and scratch and then I go

88
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:46,650
and pray, god forgive me, for this pleasure' he was feeling.

89
00:16:49,150 --> 00:17:07,339
There is another weak point. It is that they cannot support standing. Standing makes them feel irritable.

90
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:17,840
For instance, people who go to church and they have to stand, the Greek church is 2-3 hours, standing in one place

91
00:17:17,841 --> 00:17:29,960
 for Sulph., he has to either sit or go out.
It's not possible. Standing is the worst position.

92
00:17:49,160 --> 00:18:05,029
Another keynote is the sensation in the eyes that there is sand, also you will find it very frequently. Sand in the eyes

93
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:19,799
 it is a slight conjunctivitis with sand in
 the eyes. This is also characteristic.

94
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:37,479
Feet are perspiring, burning, hot perspiration, offensive and the feet are almost every day out, summer

95
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:42,639
and winter it doesn't matter. They are out of covers.

96
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:54,400
You get two things, emptiness in the stomach in the morning and feet out of covers and you finished.

97
00:18:54,460 --> 00:19:07,280
And you look at the person, really he looks dirty. A Sulph. will come and will have oil here and there.

98
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:20,959
They also like to collect things. They don't throw away things like Merc.

99
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:33,550
Merc. likes to collect, collect, newspapers, whatever and they keep it there. Merc. is similar in their rooms

100
00:19:33,551 --> 00:19:43,960
they are similar with Sulph. You can make a mistake but Sulph. is much more sloppy and dirty than Merc.

101
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:52,320
Mercury because they like to collect things, they put them there and there is no way to clean the room.

102
00:19:52,321 --> 00:19:55,360
Because of the collections.

103
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:19,287
Also you will in the Repertories saying, 'egotistical' because they have read a lot, they thought a lot.

104
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:32,479
They have the idea that they know better. 'I'm telling you. I know'. They believe that they know.

105
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:44,919
And they get this attitude which is a little bit out of reality.

106
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:04,019
-They like spices, is there any special spice?

107
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:19,010
-No. They don't like actually acid things like oranges.

108
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:23,879
They are oranges which are sweet and oranges which are a little bit acid.

109
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:34,560
Sulph. says, 'ugh, acid' where the orange is not really acid, it's a little bit acid, they don't like it.

110
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:59,850
In the books you will find it. The important things are desires fat, desires sweets and aversion eggs, aversion fish.

111
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:03,279
 These you can remember. You want to confirm.

112
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:15,040
A Sulph. who does not like sweets, you put a question mark. A Sulph. who has no warm feet, you put a question mark.

113
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:21,682
There are strong keynotes for Sulph.

114
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:30,159
- Sulph. doesn't come to the clinic as often as some homeopaths give Sulph. but can it be that there are more Sulph.

115
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,167
children than Sulph. grown ups?

116
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:38,640
Or does every Sulph. child turn into a Sulph. grown up?

117
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,769
I have relatively many Sulph. children and I do not have so many Sulph. grown ups.

118
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:48,319
So does the remedy pictures changes?

119
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:57,399
-No, no. It is just by chance that you may have seen it. I have not made this observation.

120
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:04,399
Actually I would say the opposite, not so many children and more grown ups.

121
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:12,810
Also don't forget, we say Sulph. has all kinds of eruptions.

122
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:18,399
Never mind what it is the eruption, Sulph. will have it, with itching.

123
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:28,169
If you see eruptions without itching, doubt very much whether this is a Sulph. case.

124
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:36,339
So it has to have the itching element. The itching, it itches the brain !

125
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:55,640
That nature is there and many times we have given when it's not indicated. It's going to bring about

126
00:23:55,641 --> 00:24:06,599
an aggravation of the situation. To an eruption, you give Sulph. and it's not indicated, you'll start having

127
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:19,799
aggravation, aggravation and the eruption
 will just grow and no effect.

128
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:25,639
The itching stays the same, worse, the aggravation is worse.

129
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:45,159
They like open air, they like coolness
 because they are perspiring a lot.

130
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:59,129
-We had in the University when I studied a Professor who looks like this, with eruption on the face

131
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:08,049
with a horrible mess in his room and one thing which I learned about him is that if you were to pass an exam

132
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:12,039
with him around lunch, when he is hungry, it was horrible.

133
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:16,759
Nobody can pass the exam. Is it something like that with strong hunger?

134
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:29,359
-Exactly. We brought you a nice present,
 swallow this, everybody will pass.

135
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:44,140
Another thing is also many times they cannot stand heights. Heights with looking down, it brings vertigo

136
00:25:44,141 --> 00:25:46,120
 and they don't like it.

137
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:54,599
These are the keynotes that you have to check out in a case of Sulph., if they are there.

138
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:17,189
It's very strange that in Homeopathy, many homeopaths prescribe Sulph. when not needed.

139
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:25,149
And they cannot recognize the Sulph., when it's needed. Why? Because they are missing the main points of Sulph.

140
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:33,160
And they have different ideas and projections. It's very difficult. You have to be very careful with projections

141
00:26:33,161 --> 00:26:35,151
 on the mental- emotional level.

142
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:51,370
You say, this person is not secure. It feels to me that it is insecure. Why? Because he said that when he goes

143
00:26:51,371 --> 00:26:58,529
to get his car, he first looks back.

144
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:08,049
And then you make a projection, you make a story. You have to be very careful in projecting some ideas.

145
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:21,830
This person is dirty. Why? Because
I saw oil here, Sulph.

146
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:33,349
Not like this. He has to have all the other elements. It just happened by the time he was coming to drop

147
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:39,749
something and then you give him Sulph.? Because something dropped on his shirt? No.

148
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:45,659
-Are there also Sulph's who are proper, tidy and clean?

149
00:27:45,660 --> 00:28:02,060
-Yes. There are some Sulph.s who are proper, tidy and clean and these are the cases where, as I explained again

150
00:28:02,061 --> 00:28:06,270
 there are degrees.

151
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:18,810
Somebody is cold, it's a cold person with some symptoms.

152
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:26,599
This is a pneumonia case. You start the pneumonia with Ars.

153
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:33,000
And then it's getting better but the person is getting warm.

154
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,119
It goes to Sulph.

155
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:48,850
Now in these cases where Sulph. is not the constitutional, it's just a matter of changing a little bit the temperature

156
00:28:48,851 --> 00:28:53,455
from cold to I'm not so cold.

157
00:28:53,760 --> 00:29:03,999
Wait, don't repeat Ars. I'm not so cold anymore, you search for a warm remedy.

158
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:18,519
In this case you will not find the symptom, as it's exaggerated in the relation which I do to you.

159
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:24,080
I relate these symptoms, I exaggerate so you get the idea.

160
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:37,079
There is another element which I forgot about, laziness. They feel lazy.

161
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:45,080
Just give him some ideas, give him something to occupy the mind and he is there but give him something

162
00:29:45,081 --> 00:29:55,359
practical to do and he is lazy. Give him some work to do like you have to learn, to study and learn

163
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,096
some boring things, forget it.

164
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:07,660
He will stay for 3 years in the same class.
 He is intelligent but he pays no attention.

165
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:21,119
So this person here, Ars., he will tell you 'I'm not so cold and lately I feel a little bit lazy'. These two words

166
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:34,959
indicate that he went into Sulph. state. It's not really lazy but for Ars. to be lazy is something he feels it already.

167
00:30:45,560 --> 00:31:01,119
Also there are two types. It can be fat, it can be lean. She can be Sulph. There is no fixed.

168
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:12,200
Because you get tall, thin, stoop shouldered, philosophical, dirty, you get an idea. You fix your mind in this idea

169
00:31:12,201 --> 00:31:26,030
 then you see a patient and he is not there and you go away from the idea. This is wrong. The keynotes are deciding factor.

170
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:45,509
-I wish to know something about the mental pathological picture. Perhaps if somebody has several times

171
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:58,480
gonorrhea and then treated. And then he gets for 25 years loss of concentration and all these typical symptoms of Sulph.

172
00:31:58,481 --> 00:32:07,889
like philosophical matters and reading one book in one night and in the other night, another subject

173
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,619
could it be like this?

174
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:15,629
What you have described so far is not typical
 of Sulph. It can be Cann-i., Cann-s.

175
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:27,979
But if in this picture you add feet burning, takes them out of cover, then it becomes Sulph. You have to be careful.

176
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:42,379
The idea also in the mental sphere is the criticism and the theoretical.

177
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:51,200
If you combine the two, then you get the idea. A philosopher, he likes to discuss all philosophical matters.

178
00:32:51,201 --> 00:32:59,899
He likes actually to criticize and to show
through this criticism, how intelligent he is.

179
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:07,919
If it's a Calc. child and goes into Sulph. state,
can still be obese? Yes it can be obese.

180
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:27,119
But to go from Calc. state to Sulph. state, usually it means that the child is burning more energy.

181
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:42,609
So it will be reducing in the weight. It will become a little bit thinner than before. Still it may be obese but thinner than before.

182
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:52,589
-In the past days we have heard so much about certain traumas which cause a certain pathology. What is the case in Sulph.?

183
00:33:53,400 --> 00:34:16,529
-The same causes. When somebody suffers in his ego, that means his ego is affected or his emotions have been

184
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:28,519
suffering because of different events in their lives, then eventually they will develop the Sulph. symptomatology.

185
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:39,780
We have to be separating these few things.

186
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:51,069
This is a pneumonia case.

187
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:59,359
Ars., Sulph., Calc.. With Calc. you treated the pneumonia, it's finished.

188
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:07,050
In this case you will not see the
mental- emotional picture of Sulph.

189
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:16,559
It's a different case, when we have a chronic case, the case that we discuss, where Sulph. is the main

190
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:23,919
chronic remedy for this patient.
This is what we're describing here.

191
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:41,179
This picture of Sulph. will tend to be of that type. We'll have a tendency. The feet here for Ars. being so cold

192
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:49,259
 you give Arsenicum and the feet are getting a little bit more warm than the other body.

193
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:56,279
That is an indication it's going towards the Sulph. state, the patient.

194
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:17,619
Because every symptom has a starting point and a climax. In between, all this time you have degrees of that symptom.

195
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:31,250
You get in the beginning stages a Sulph., the symptoms will be very subtle, not strong.

196
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,711
And as they go to a climax, then you have
 the description that I'm doing.

197
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:49,099
What I'm doing is, I'm giving here the direction. This is the direction it's going but you don't have it all along of course.

198
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:06,509
These are very difficult things but these are the things that make the difference in prescribing.

199
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:13,849
When you have a typical case, everybody will give Puls., everybody will give Sulph., everybody will give Calc.

200
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:22,020
The difference is when you are able to perceive quickly the development of a remedy.

201
00:37:22,021 --> 00:37:30,549
To say, that remedy is coming up and you give it  and then you see the difference, that's a miracle.

202
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:40,280
-I have heard that there are some remedies that are very deep acting, including Sulph., Calc., Lyc.

203
00:37:40,281 --> 00:37:48,319
My question is now, if there are strong Sulph. keynotes and the patient might need another remedy

204
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:53,319
as an upper layer, how can we differentiate this?

205
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:16,080
- Old homeopaths have observed that there was a cycle that goes like that. You start with Sulph., it goes to Calc.

206
00:38:16,081 --> 00:38:22,440
 the patient and then it goes to Lyc.
And then again the cycle.

207
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:29,029
It is a matter of intensity of symptoms.

208
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:44,689
You started with this intensity, Sulph., Calc., Lyc. and comes to this intensity. Sulph., Calc., Lyc. and comes to

209
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:55,530
this intensity, Sulph.,Calc.,Lyc. so you may need 3 times to go through this cycle in a treatment of 3-4 years

210
00:38:55,531 --> 00:39:04,719
 before you bring about a cure in severe chronic conditions.

211
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:16,690
-I have a daughter for whom I searched for 10 years to find the correct homeopathic remedy for her.

212
00:39:16,691 --> 00:39:25,559
A timid, withdrawn young girl, even in 12 or 14 years of age she did not have one girlfriend

213
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:34,159
and what I could very difficult tolerate, although I love her, is that she never answered to a question.

214
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:42,399
We went to restaurant and asked would you like to eat pizza or salad, she only moved her shoulders and kept quiet.

215
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:52,640
I gave her Ph-ac. and I don't know what kind of remedies until one day I discovered that between her books

216
00:39:52,641 --> 00:39:56,089
 I found a banana peel of last month.

217
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:59,400
Sulph. brought a certain amelioration.

218
00:39:59,401 --> 00:40:08,510
Is it possible that in females, maybe more than in males, you can also find the Sulph. type who is very timid

219
00:40:08,511 --> 00:40:16,079
 very withdrawn, does not make contact easily, does not desire to answer and mostly reads?

220
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:25,489
-The case he describes looks to me, of course I cannot answer hypothetical questions like that. I don't have

221
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:34,409
 all the information but it looks to me that Sulph. will do something and then another remedy has to be given.

222
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:48,399
You go to this timidity it's very high in climax, you start with Sulph. because you see some signs and the timidity will continue.

223
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:58,360
And she may need Sil. as a continuation, she may need Bar-c. and then comes back to Sulph.

224
00:40:58,361 --> 00:41:01,839
and then Bar-c. and then Sulph.

225
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:18,570
And you take her out of that intense timidity because this is something like between timidity and closeness

226
00:41:18,571 --> 00:41:26,689
 being very closed and lack of self confidence. All these issues have to be taken in consideration in this case

227
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:33,239
because this is the crux of the matter here, this timidity.

228
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,490
Sulph. will open up the case.

229
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:50,480
In the books we read Sulph. sometimes will open up the case, when there is no reaction from other remedies

230
00:41:50,481 --> 00:41:57,879
 you give Sulph., it opens up the case and then the next remedy becomes more clear.

231
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:09,860
These are ideas which are not to be followed blindly. You have to have this indication like the banana in the book.

232
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:17,189
There are some indications of Sulph., then you give it, then you see some effect, then you have to follow it up

233
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:20,349
 with another remedy.

234
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:34,450
-George, do Sulph. children have the same keynotes as the adults, of dirty and philosophical, do they have

235
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:39,289
unpleasant discharges, hot feet always put them out of covers?

236
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:47,960
-Yes, children usually because they have
strong mechanism, they will have eruptions.

237
00:42:47,961 --> 00:42:53,479
Children will have eruptions, they will be lazy, they will not do their lessons.

238
00:42:54,690 --> 00:43:04,400
'Do your lesson', 'No'. This type of person, 'oh I have to do now this'.

239
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:21,320
They have the laziness, the critical, not philosophical but the eruption, the dirtiness, the laziness.

240
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:37,549
And in desires they will have the desire for sweets and fish and eggs they will avoid.

241
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:45,079
Sometimes very strong aversion, sometimes
 they never touch in their life eggs or fish.

242
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,479
-Are they always lazy?

243
00:43:48,480 --> 00:44:05,879
-Laziness is very strong in children. That type of 'do I have to do that now?'. And they can be obese or thin children.

244
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:15,270
-George I want to relate a Sulph. case I have in my clinic. He is a high politician and he is one of the most elegant

245
00:44:15,271 --> 00:44:22,330
 persons which I even saw, completely tidy. And it took me a long time to find out that he is Sulph.

246
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,192
And he has high triglycerides.
His triglycerides are 4800.

247
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:41,880
When you take the blood and you put the syringe there, it turned white and then finally by talking with his wife

248
00:44:41,881 --> 00:44:50,000
 I found out he is Sulph. So with Sulph. the triglycerides are totally normal in spite of drinking alcohol.

249
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:58,759
-They are great alcohol drinkers.

250
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:06,259
-But the disturbance on this level is totally gone by Sulph., it was incredible.

251
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:20,236
-There is a kind of arteriosclerosis with Sulph. which comes early and you may see the trembling of arteriosclerosis.

252
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,880
It's not actually Parkinson.

253
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:38,769
The lower lip trembling and then the hand and it goes like this because of the early sclerosis of the arteries.

254
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:45,129
It's a kind of arteriosclerosis which comes early in life and produces this.

255
00:45:50,930 --> 00:46:06,200
I like to observe very much and I had a case here of Sulph. He would come and he was as if he had urinated his pants

256
00:46:06,201 --> 00:46:17,829
 he was always like that and big blotches
of whatever, I don't know what it was.

257
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:28,369
And then you give the Sulph. and he goes to cut his hair, put things clean.

258
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:35,149
It's automatic, they don't realize the changes. They don't realize. If you tell him, are you different now?

259
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:42,300
 He says, 'what is different? Ah this pain is better, yes'.

260
00:46:47,590 --> 00:47:01,029
The desk is full of papers and he says, don't touch anything because they know where is each paper.

261
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:11,529
You go and change and put order, they will kill you because they lose everything.

262
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:25,609
-I have two questions. The one is, what about the mental stamina to perform work?

263
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:36,380
-If they are not interested, mentally if they are not excited about the project, forget it. If they are interested

264
00:47:36,381 --> 00:47:39,710
 they will go on working day and night.

265
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:48,879
-And the other is, what about the sexual drive?

266
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:55,560
-Sexually they are performing quite well.

267
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:17,359
 It's not an area where they suffer. Of course, I don't say they have excessive sexual desires.

268
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:28,220
But because they're burning a lot of energy, they are producing a lot of energy, the sexual performance

269
00:48:28,221 --> 00:48:36,729
is quite good and I've not seen complaining, either men or women.

270
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:45,759
Laziness comes from the fact that mentally
 is not taking an interest in this subject.

271
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:52,820
Once they don't take interest, they cannot push themselves to do the work. This you have to do, this is

272
00:48:52,821 --> 00:48:57,619
your homework, forget it. This is your task,
you have to do. Forget it.

273
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:05,560
But if there is an exciting thing which excites them, they can sit the whole night talking about which

274
00:49:05,561 --> 00:49:11,909
 philosophical system is bad, which political system is bad.

275
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:17,120
They become the theoreticians behind the politicians.

276
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:23,560
They have all these ideas, they bring ideas because the mind is active but the moment you put them to do

277
00:49:23,561 --> 00:49:31,390
a task which is boring, the laziness comes.
And that's why they say, 'I'm lazy'.

278
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:40,480
-You said that the aversion to eggs is very strong. I know a patient who was the full picture of Sulph.

279
00:49:40,481 --> 00:49:47,410
but he has craving for eggs. He eats eggs every day in big quantity. Eggs and milk actually.

280
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:57,839
-I think is because of that. The egg craving comes from underlined Calc. You watch it out.

281
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:05,689
You will see Sulph. will cure him to a certain extend, then Calc., then most probably he will go into that.

282
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:16,919
-Months ago I had an amazing case with a horse. A patient of mine is dealing with horses and some day

283
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:24,039
 he phoned me and told me one of the horses had skin eruption and she described the horse very well.

284
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:31,200
She said, this horse is like a pig, very dirty.

285
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:48,889
All his stool is spread and very dirty. I gave Sulph. and the skin eruption went away.

286
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:58,809
It was amazing the horse became really clean. After this the stool was very proper, in one corner.

287
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:24,039
-It's very frequent that all discharges and stool is very offensive. Sulph. stool is very offensive.

288
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:36,319
One time I was in a Congress and the toilets were downstairs. Somebody went to the toilets and as I walked

289
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:45,000
downstairs the smell was coming all over.
Who went into this toilet?

290
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:50,689
 Find him and give him Sulph. quickly.

291
00:51:53,920 --> 00:52:04,090
It will change the offensiveness within one day because the fermentation is not correct.

292
00:52:04,091 --> 00:52:09,120
The moment it is correct, the smell goes.
