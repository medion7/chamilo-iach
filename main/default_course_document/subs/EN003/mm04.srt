1
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:46,270
Anacardium means in Greek 'one without heart'.

2
00:00:52,290 --> 00:01:00,920
One without a heart is a hard person.

3
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:25,398
Cruelty, hardness, malicious is a characteristic of this remedy. It's very interesting that in ancient Greece already

4
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:36,788
 I don't know how they found out, that people who ate this drug became heartless, became hard.

5
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:49,560
Most probably they have noticed that this
 remedy was bringing about a state of cruelty.

6
00:01:51,240 --> 00:02:01,218
But what is characteristic of this you see
 internal conflict, contradiction inside

7
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,490
 two things are contradicting inside me.

8
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:18,650
 And the idea is, the one is good and the other is bad.

9
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,150
Thinks he is possessed of two wills opposing each other.

10
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:52,848
This contradiction can be on any level and on anything. If they cannot decide really what is their best way

11
00:02:52,910 --> 00:03:02,168
 of going about, if they cannot decide, they
are vacillating between this and the opposite.

12
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:09,188
Most probably this is going to be an Anacardium case.

13
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:29,658
Vacillating, not being able to take decision, great lack of self-confidence with feelings of inferiority and emotional hardness.

14
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:45,708
Feelings of inferiority is very severe, lack of self-confidence. People who are really suffering with this idea.

15
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:54,800
'I'm not good, I do not know anything',
even if they are very good at their work.

16
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:06,038
I've seen a doctor working for years
in his laboratory, doing very well,

17
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:15,708
he was in charge of the department with tremendous lack of self-confidence.

18
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:28,298
He thought he was not able to perform anything. He thought that he was worse than the first young doctor who came in.

19
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:37,298
And he was given the half of the Materia Medica, he was in America.

20
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:49,858
That element was so strong, nice man, sweet. They can be very sweet. The emotional hardness we say here,

21
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:57,558
you will always hear they are beating their wife or they are killing animals and things like that.

22
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:04,578
 This can happen of course but not in all cases.

23
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:14,138
Especially the cases that do not have self confidence are very sweet, very nice.

24
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,448
A person who has inferiority complex, I am worse than anybody.

25
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:32,738
If you see a case where the suffering comes primarily from lack of self confidence then the remedy is

26
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,320
either Anacardium or Baryta Carbonica.

27
00:05:42,320 --> 00:06:01,728
If at the same time they are tormented by thoughts which are opposing each other, Anacardium.

28
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:33,838
You see here I've put either cruel, sadistic and malicious or helpless, hopeless, pleading, needy and insecure.

29
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:42,240
It can be either.

30
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:54,788
But all of them, all these types they will have
lack of self confidence and internal conflict.

31
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:10,808
Another characteristic of Anacardium is that the people who need Anacardium, they need to say swear words.

32
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:36,858
Go to hell, bastard. In their vocabulary such words slowly they come. If you observe a case and you observe

33
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:54,858
the developing of these traits you see a person who never sworn before neither his education nor his social status

34
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:59,637
 justifies this kind of language.

35
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:08,178
They suddenly need to express themselves,
 to express their anger with such words.

36
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,428
 That is the time where the Anacardium
picture is starting, is developing.

37
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:23,978
Both types will have the same tendency.

38
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:44,398
The question is, both these types, the cruel and sadistic and the helpless and hopeless, do both have this tendency?

39
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:49,338
I said, yes. Both have the tendency for swearing words.

40
00:08:49,400 --> 00:09:05,200
Another is sudden loss of memory. As if the mind is blocked. This is very characteristic again.

41
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:20,618
Anacardium will be a case where he leaves this room to go inside and bring the water from inside.

42
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:32,338
He reaches this room and he says, why did I come here?

43
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:46,180
Oh my God everybody needs Anacardium!

44
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:55,928
And there is a block, total block, sudden loss of memory.

45
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:13,675
He remembers everything and suddenly, even in young people, there is a block and then they say... 'oh water!'

46
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:37,508
So sudden loss of memory together with either lack of self confidence or internal conflict or

47
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:43,578
sensation of a band around a single part.
Like the knee, elbow.

48
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:52,338
You put a band here and you put it tight, how it feels?

49
00:10:52,400 --> 00:11:09,270
In different parts, joints they have the feeling of a tight band. The pain always has this feeling as if something is tight around.

50
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:21,938
This is really a characteristic if it goes with

51
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:31,410
sudden loss of memory or it goes with
the need to swear or with the conflict.

52
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:46,458
People also who are heartless, they can treat humans or animals as if they don't have feelings.

53
00:11:50,590 --> 00:12:00,800
There is something peculiar happening which I will try to describe. If I lose my feelings, I don't have feelings or I have

54
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:18,048
a hardness inside me, there is a block on my feelings, the feelings are usually fluid, they run they never stop.

55
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:25,660
You imagine some person whose feelings
 are stopped and become hard.

56
00:12:25,722 --> 00:12:33,490
Now such a person needs a shock to move his feelings.

57
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:47,768
The Anacardium is led to do malice, to do bad, to hurt somebody else to move his feelings.

58
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:38,738
If Anacardium gets irritated and angry, the tendency is that he wants really to do something very malicious, very hard.

59
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:51,403
You see you get angry, you shout a little bit and it's finished. The Anacardium needs to go all the way, to really hurt you

60
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:59,258
but in such a way you say, my god he does not have feelings this man or this woman?

61
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:13,098
He can be so harsh with animals. He has an animal and the animal is doing something bad and then

62
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:28,538
the punishment is extreme. He hits the animal and there is a kind of emotions inside, the emotions are very hard.

63
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:48,218
It's very difficult to make you imagine the situation, the emotions are hard so nothing

64
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:55,130
satisfies my anger unless I kill the dog.

65
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:10,358
And then there is the opposite state. Once the emotions are released, comes a state of tremendous

66
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:20,068
sensitivity on the emotions. It's the opposite state.

67
00:15:48,000 --> 00:16:10,218
Let us say, a woman has a relationship with a man and she feels insecure, she has no self confidence.

68
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:25,068
Therefore she can be hurt very easily because of that state. If you have next to you somebody who is inferior

69
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:34,818
feels that you are powerful she can be
hurt very easily. Now what happens?

70
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:46,550
She's hurt very easily  and the
 emotions become hard, harsh.

71
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:53,310
And then the tendency will be what?

72
00:16:53,372 --> 00:17:04,258
Either she will tell you the relationship is
 finished because there is no emotions.

73
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:16,130
The emotions are harsh, dead. So under this pain she feels, she will say 'go away'.

74
00:17:16,192 --> 00:17:28,728
And you maybe pleading saying why,
 why she has been hurt by little things

75
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:43,338
that you cannot imagine for what little reason but the sensitivity and the lack of self confidence is so great.

76
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:56,525
'You did not phone me, 3 hours passed and did not phone'. That is enough to make the emotions hard

77
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:06,440
 and then once they are hard, she is very harsh.

78
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:20,698
Go away, I don't like you, it's finished.
She does not feel anything, she can hurt more and more until such time

79
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:34,350
when that emotions have been satisfied with their cruelty and then she turns back to become again vulnerable etc.

80
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:53,358
 This conflict state: I'm so bad and then
another idea comes she says, I'm so good.

81
00:18:53,420 --> 00:19:01,188
Because the emotions when they come
they are very vulnerable, very sensitive.

82
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:15,908
Opposing states, the harshness and the super sensitivity like somebody who says, 'I've hurt you'.

83
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:34,141
'But no, you didn't hurt me'. 'No I know I've hurt you so badly'. Remembers something she has done and exaggerates this.

84
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:58,338
And there are also skin eruptions. Anacardium is a remedy which is indicated a lot in skin eruptions.

85
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:06,578
The main thing that you have to remember is that there are eruptions with intolerable itching and

86
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:16,298
the more she scratches the more the itching.
You can't imagine how much it can go.

87
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:24,818
It can lead the person to almost spasms. It can lead to a hysterical state where the person

88
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:39,808
scratches and goes up and down, it takes a brush, scratches with brush, with towel.

89
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,808
They scream! Then there is a climax and then they may calm.

90
00:20:53,720 --> 00:21:05,478
They tell you, I know that if I start scratching I had it'. So if you hear that, ah we go for Anacardium.

91
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:14,453
And then what happens? I scratch more and more until I go crazy. Anacardium.

92
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:27,828
Agaricus and Anacardium you will need them quite frequently actually in our times.

93
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:52,200
Because the beginning of mental derangement in our societies take this kind of picture, Agaricus or Anacardium so far.

94
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:07,488
There is a regeneration, a rearrangement
in the mind and the body, a different attitude

95
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:12,920
does not need to swear,
does not need to do this.

96
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:19,030
Does not need. It's gone.

97
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:36,821
-I would like to know if we should remember at Anacardium humiliation as a trigger point.

98
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:45,298
-No, who said it's humiliation, did I say humiliation?

99
00:22:45,360 --> 00:23:01,075
-No. Because you talked about sensitivity and if somebody decides to do something because of some small event.

100
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:21,938
-No, Anacardium has nothing to do with humiliation. Actually Anacardium can take a lot of humiliation without

101
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:30,708
really having the results of other remedies, like Ignatia, Natrum Muriaticum.

102
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:40,358
If you humiliate them, there is a big problem. With Anacardium you can humiliate them because

103
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:44,538
they feel humiliated themselves, it doesn't matter.

104
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:55,668
Is it possible that Anacardium will be harsh on himself and be nice outside? I said, no.

105
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:09,198
The remedy who is harsh to himself and nice outside is Aurum for instance. It can be very harsh and cruel to himself.

106
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:30,848
When I say no at that stage, things are absolutely cut and dry. But what I'm driving at is to give you the initial

107
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:43,738
 the basic idea. If you mix this idea, you dilute, you dilute and when it comes to the point, you don't recognize it.

108
00:24:45,740 --> 00:25:01,618
So lack of self confidence, sudden loss of memory and conflict, malicious the one, very sensitive the other.

109
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:06,978
That's it. That's Anacardium. What are the words?

110
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:14,058
I'm not interested on the words because
they are written down in all Materia Medicas.

111
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:28,098
You don't need another on top of this. What you need is to make a few points, write them down in big letters.

112
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:44,790
Fear of cancer, half a page, Agaricus. If fear of cancer is so small, Calcarea carbonica, it also has fear of cancer.

113
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:55,898
 But big fear of cancer overwhelming fear
 of cancer....you have to get this idea

114
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:03,760
words do not convey the idea, the intensity, the picture.

115
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:19,778
When a person sits down in front of you and says the first words, if you have this basic knowledge your mind will go

116
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:31,898
 to a small group of remedies immediately. And then from there you choose, you differentiate. But if you are lost

117
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:39,658
 in all this information which comes with thousands and thousands of symptoms then you are lost entirely.

118
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:47,917
You don't know where to search, where to look, what to do. This is the idea.

119
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,840
What do you see here?

120
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,280
What impresses you here?

121
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:37,960
Edema, spelt in American way. In English is spelt with oe.

122
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:54,040
Edema, swelling of the extremities. When we talk about swelling of the extremities they become really swell hard.

123
00:27:54,130 --> 00:28:00,900
Due to the dysfunction of the kidneys.

124
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:16,150
Puffy swelling especially under the eyes.

125
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:40,558
It is interesting that the pains of Apis are stinging pains as if stung  by a bee and then the swelling comes like urticaria

126
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:50,050
 or swelling of ankles and hard swelling.

127
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:24,458
Worse from heat. People who are suffering with heat and people who do have a sharp tongue, they sting you with their words.

128
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:53,138
They are people with strong emotions, jealous, passionate, sexually quite active and easily excited but also very awkward.

129
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:57,870
What is awkward?

130
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,628
-Unusual?

131
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:50,328
- It is clumsy. I am awkward if I walk here and I fall down. There is a state of passion, if somebody is

132
00:30:50,390 --> 00:31:01,078
 usually involved with his emotions, does not pay attention to the people around, so he either pushes, throws things

133
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:05,810
 falls down, you know clumsy.

134
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:14,008
This is another remedy which is better with cold applications.

135
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:20,978
It is a warm remedy, it has burning pains and it is better with cold applications.

136
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:31,360
Which is another remedy which is better with cold applications that we talked about?

137
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:51,770
-Aloe. This is what I want, the whole class, Aloe! You got the idea?

138
00:31:53,750 --> 00:32:05,740
Fear of cancer? Agaricus! You never forget this.

139
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:21,098
Once we come to the 20th remedy then we start wobbling, being awkward, very clumsy.

140
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:35,738
So kidney problems, swelling under the eyes, around the face, swellings in general, swelling which is burning

141
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:47,578
better with cold applications swellings of ankles
of the extremities, clumsiness, falls down,

142
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:52,160
 throws things around, he doesn't pay attention.

143
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:15,460
And then they cry and cry without any cause. Despondency.

144
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:39,880
Something is not good inside and they cry and cry. They don't know why. Dissatisfied.

145
00:33:54,650 --> 00:34:08,320
And this remedy which is hot and burning and which is better with cold applications, is it natural to have thirst?

146
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,818
-Yes.

147
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:18,378
- It does not. Remember this. It does
not have thirst. Usually is thirstless.

148
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:41,988
But when it has a chill during fever, then it becomes thirsty.

149
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:56,458
The remedy is thirstless but when there is fever and chill, the moment it feels cold, then it's thirsty,

150
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:01,230
the moment it feels warm then it's not thirsty.

151
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:10,340
This peculiarity you remember is Apis.

152
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:29,558
 Diarrhea, loses stool with motion.
Which is the other remedy that loses stool?

153
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,818
-Aloe.

154
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:44,700
-Aloe with flatus, with wind. This loses stool on motion.

155
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,920
You don't use your imagination.

156
00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:14,578
Intermittent fever. Chill with thirst at 3 pm.
At 3 pm there is an aggravation or there is a fever which comes

157
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:22,230
 and has its peak at 3 pm, this is Apis.

158
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,160
 I don't need anything more.

159
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:57,730
Extreme anxiety about health. Fear of death.

160
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:07,800
Which is the other remedy we said anxiety about health?

161
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:17,525
-Agaricus.

162
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,538
-Which was the fear of death?

163
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:37,050
-Aconite. Now, this has both anxiety about health and fear of death. Combines these two.

164
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:52,730
It's not that he is afraid he is going to die from cancer or whatever. He's just afraid to die, from heart, from cancer etc.

165
00:37:53,840 --> 00:38:06,338
So Argentum nitricum is one of the main remedies that we use for this syndrome that we see very frequently today

166
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:21,818
where people esp. people who have lived a nice life, they have enjoyed very much there is a point where they get

167
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:36,458
into that stage. They are afraid they are going
 to die and that their health is threatened.

168
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:48,898
But with this fear and anxiety what do we have together with this? The main impact is on impulsiveness.

169
00:38:49,720 --> 00:39:02,680
 He is impulsive. It's a person that he will speak out in a very impulsive way.

170
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:24,058
A person whose mind will stick on certain ideas which have danger and they are attracted by this idea.

171
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:41,658
The idea that I will put my fingers or a wire on the plug. And the person sits here and studies and the idea is there

172
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:49,528
what will happen if I put two wires in this plug? And he tries, and then the idea comes again

173
00:39:52,320 --> 00:40:03,888
he tries to concentrate and the idea comes again. And then he gets up, this is a little bit extreme,

174
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:17,000
 then he gets up and goes up to the point to stick the wires on that plug, to see what happens.

175
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,820
And the last minute he says, my god.

176
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:33,058
They are in a high place, they look down and they imagine what would happen if I just fall down.

177
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:42,518
 They say, 'go away from there' and then they go back again, what would happen, how would I feel.

178
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:51,818
And the idea comes again and again and at a certain moment they imagine they are falling down

179
00:40:51,880 --> 00:41:05,320
their head is crushed on the ground, they imagine the whole scene, and then they come back to themselves.

180
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:14,218
The mind is attracted by such idea. You understand that a mind that works in this way, the quality

181
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:23,840
of the mind is not good. It has a lot of problems.

182
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:38,898
 It's very strange how it's attracted to do things though the anxiety about health is so great,

183
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:46,560
 the fear of death is so great; yet they put there their hands.

184
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:59,278
A very characteristic case, I have said it many times. I was fishing with a friend and we got a fish, a dragon fish.

185
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:10,258
If you touch that fish you can die from pain. So I got one fish like that, put it in the basket and said to him.

186
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:21,018
This is a dragon fish, do you see it? Yes. Don't touch it. I put it in the basket and I continue fishing.

187
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:33,968
Then as I turn around and I see he is putting his hand in the basket to move it. I said 'for God's sake if this hits you

188
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:45,848
and you suddenly go like this, then we have to go back immediately'. Then I turn around fishing and
again his hand

189
00:42:45,910 --> 00:43:00,458
he is not fishing, just trying....I say 'for God's sake don't touch!'. Then I turn around and again.

190
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:04,658
 And then I thought, oh my God!

191
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:14,698
We have been treating him for anxiety about health, fear of death, he was a nice man, very communicative, Phosphorus.

192
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:20,280
We gave Phos again and again saying a little bit be better.

193
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:35,498
Then it's like an enlightenment, this is a case
 of Arg-n. We gave Arg-n, finished.

194
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:49,398
He was on the telephone all the time, I have my heart, then I have cancer then he had the head, then...

195
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:53,600
and just an observation like this, is finished.

196
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:10,988
They walk here and say, 'if I touch one line, I am finished'. And they can walk like this for hours not being able to

197
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:24,748
 touch a line because if I touch a line... They go around and they say 'if I turn in that corner

198
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:31,728
something bad will happen' and they turn around all this way from the other side.

199
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:51,378
They are stuck with certain ideas. The idea is to understand the quality of the mind, that you have to have in mind.

200
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:19,918
And there is also a problem if they have to meet somebody, to meet with an appointment. They get very anxious inside

201
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:27,258
and they have to run to the bathroom several times before they can go to the appointment.

202
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:40,738
Sometimes they reach to the point where they have diarrhea before the appointment is approaching

203
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:51,320
they have to run to the bathroom and
then quickly rush to the appointment.

204
00:45:52,280 --> 00:46:06,938
They come to be treated for colitis or others, it doesn't matter. What it matters is to have this unique characteristics of the remedy.

205
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:21,438
That is the whole secret in Homeopathy. We will be talking about 200 remedies and not one will look like another.

206
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:33,108
Each one will have its own personality, its own characteristics. Yet, if you look upon superficially you say

207
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:38,338
oh he has anxiety about his health, oh he has fear of death.

208
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:52,138
Yes but this coupled with this kind of mind, it makes it Arg-n. coupled with the fear that he soon dies

209
00:46:52,200 --> 00:47:00,658
it makes it Aconite, coupled with the overwhelming fear of cancer, makes it Agaricus.

210
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:25,740
It is a matter of combination of 2-3 symptoms together which you are expecting to see in an Arg-n case.

211
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:40,778
Another characteristic is aggravation, desire for sweets, desire for salt, strong desire but if he eats the sweets

212
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:55,698
then he has aggravation he has flatulence, burning in the stomach, bad feelings, bad condition.

213
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:12,888
Diarrhea after eating sugar. Sugar is like poison for him, though he desires sweets very much.

214
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:33,578
And then another characteristic on the digestion is that their abdomen is bloated with gas, with air.

215
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:50,200
And there are eructations which are very loud. You hear eructations of Arg-n, they cannot hide it

216
00:48:51,160 --> 00:49:00,000
 neither they will try to hide it. It's like a machine gun.

217
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:13,418
Gas from down and up in a forceful way.
You see the bloatness, you see the gas

218
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:36,060
but is it Lyc., is it Carb-v another one, is it Chin, or it is Arg-n? In order to be Arg-n  you need
these loud, machine gun eructations.

219
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:55,228
And they are worse from heat, who else is worse from heat?

220
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:02,670
Apis, very good.

221
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:14,890
Aggravation from heat, from sweets.

222
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:42,218
Another characteristic is what is called granular conjunctivitis. I will explain to you.

223
00:50:42,280 --> 00:51:00,188
In the white of the eye, there is a spot like raw meat, a very red spot on the conjunctiva.

224
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:14,660
You just see that sign, immediately your mind should go to two remedies, one is Arg-n and the other is Medorrhinum.

225
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:48,208
Red spot but not red eyes, this is different. When the whole of the eye is red and inflammed is different

226
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:56,298
it's Euphrasia, Clematis, Graphites, different remedies.

227
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:32,638
This is the eye here, it looks like this. If this is much bigger, most probably is Medorrhinum.

228
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:48,468
I had a friend of mine, he was suffering with asthma. Though he knew me, he never asked me for a remedy.

229
00:52:51,950 --> 00:53:04,878
One time he asked me for something very mild, I can't remember now. He had that spot and I knew.

230
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:21,968
Also I've seen him, he ate a lot of sweets I had observed and one time he asked for something very minute.

231
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:35,508
He says, do you have something for this? He was a pharmacist. I'm talking about 1969 when I first went to Greece.

232
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:47,138
As he was a pharmacist he used to take for his asthma, his medication, he didn't believe.

233
00:53:47,200 --> 00:54:00,538
I said, yes take this and I gave him a dose of Arg-n. He comes after few days and says, 'you know I had asthma

234
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:09,178
and after the remedy I don't feel the asthma anymore. Has anything to do with the remedy?'

235
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:18,948
I said, 'yes this is Homeopathy. You don't believe, you are a pharmacist, now you better believe'.

236
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:27,563
Maybe it was this spot here, I can't remember now but it was something irrelevant.

237
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:37,460
His whole organism changed.
Out of a little observation like that.

238
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:46,978
It is so important because it is unique. It is only this remedy which has that kind.

239
00:54:47,040 --> 00:55:04,190
Because if the whole conjunctiva becomes red, lots of remedies but that so strong is Argentum.

240
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:27,320
Everybody knows Arnica.

241
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:22,058
This is a remedy that does not like others to come near her. Why? Because of the fear they may hurt them.

242
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,058
They say don't touch me.

243
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:31,828
There are people who say, don't touch me,
 I don't like to be touched.

244
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:52,758
And this is a remedy which produces ailments after injuries from blunt instruments.

245
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:59,738
You hit like this and then all this becomes blue.

246
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:11,258
And it's very painful. If it blue but not painful, Arnica is not indicated. That's why Arnica will not act all the time.

247
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:31,797
Arnica has to be very painful. The idea is not only when they are under injury, when they are hurt.

248
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:46,328
They don't like to be approached, to be touched, to be squeezed as a constitution without being hurt.

249
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:13,870
It says, the pain of the head is such that the pillow feels very hard. The pillow how hard it can be?

250
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:22,483
But for them it is like stone, like lying on a stone. You understand the sensitivity?

251
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:48,748
This fear of being touched, approached, I have seen it in women that they cannot have sexual intercourse.

252
00:58:48,810 --> 00:59:01,638
Women who cannot even think of having full sexual intercourse. It is impossible for them to have the idea

253
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:19,360
 of being penetrated. The idea is as if they are hurt through sexual intercourse; so much that they will avoid totally.

254
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:29,880
 Not that they have aversion to sex. They have desire for sex but they cannot have full sexual intercourse.

255
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:45,538
I've met a woman of 35 years old. She never had any sexual intercourse though she had tremendous desire.

256
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:54,538
She said, the idea of being penetrated for me is totally out of question.

257
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:28,250
She became pregnant after 9 months, after Arnica. I said how? By accident. I said yes, accidents happen also.

258
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:43,178
This traumatic experience can be in premature birth. In premature birth, you may have some trauma, you may

259
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:59,868
have some injury to the head or to the body and then this will remain as a memory of trauma and then of course

260
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:06,750
 it may develop eventually into a case of Arnica.

261
01:01:07,970 --> 01:01:24,820
The most dramatic cure I have seen
with Arnica it was with one cock.

262
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:39,800
Who died with a brain injury.

263
01:01:58,850 --> 01:02:11,568
He was totally dead, he looked totally dead because he was hitting his head against the glass, trying to get

264
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:23,080
to the other cock who was to the other side and he was hitting, hitting and then he collapsed.

265
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:43,818
And the cock was given to me by my neighbor and I thought oh my god, I took the cock and told them that he died

266
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:56,338
most probably today because he was ok yesterday and whether they would like to cook him.

267
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:00,928
She said 'a dead cock? Never!'

268
01:03:00,990 --> 01:03:10,678
I said 'either you like to eat him or I can survive him, what do you prefer?'

269
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:23,628
She said 'you are joking?', I said 'why, he just died, you can eat him'.

270
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:38,898
So I brought some Arnica, I put some water and I gave the cock a little bit of a drop, put it in his mouth like this.

271
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:52,743
The moment I put it there was a jerk. I said to her, keep on giving this water. Next day, the cock was jumping.

272
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:16,218
It is a remedy that is indicated in head injuries with hematoma in the head even if the hematoma

273
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:33,938
has stayed for years and has caused severe problems. The hematoma can be absorbed back after years.

274
01:04:35,950 --> 01:04:42,670
This was very interesting case I just remembered.

275
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:55,998
He came to me to be treated but he was deaf  and we had to shout very much.

276
01:04:56,060 --> 01:05:14,478
'How are you?', 'I have this pain'. 'What about the pain?', 'It's ok, take Arnica'.

277
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:23,578
He gave me some characteristics, I don't remember now, I'm talking back in 1970. I gave a dose of Arnica

278
01:05:24,930 --> 01:05:35,509
and then after 2 months he comes back,
he was from a village and I said 'how are you?'

279
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:52,988
He said 'don't shout'. I said 'what?', 'I can hear and I don't know how it happened because I was deaf for 15 years. I can hear'.

280
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:15,957
His deafness was because of a head injury which had affected the acoustic nerve. Miraculous, in 2 months this was reduced.

281
01:06:16,130 --> 01:06:30,760
He said, don't shout. His hearing was back to 85-90 %, we could talk like this, no problem.

282
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:57,068
Another characteristic is that if you get a patient in semi-coma and you see he is in a such a deep state

283
01:06:57,130 --> 01:07:10,167
and you ask a question and immediately responds and gives you an answer and then goes back into coma.

284
01:07:11,490 --> 01:07:23,988
It's very interesting, it's like stimulating this person with some sock, he comes back

285
01:07:24,050 --> 01:07:30,648
gives you the answer and goes back to coma. This is characteristic of Arnica.

286
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:45,150
But if a person is in a coma and comes out of the coma and he starts giving you the answer, this is Baptisia.

287
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:55,200
If during the giving of the answer cannot finish his words and goes back into coma, that's Baptisia.

288
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:12,096
You just remember this, that first of all you have to have injuries, not injuries that cut the skin open.

289
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:27,628
You have usually injuries which they were blunt, a concussion not open, then there was a problem afterwards.

290
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:37,824
If the head was open, 99 % will not be Arnica indicated.

291
01:08:37,850 --> 01:08:46,378
If the head was not open, was concussed and after this you have dilatation of pupils, you have headaches

292
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:55,618
you have vertigos, you have fears, you have injuries, then Arnica will be indicated.

293
01:08:55,680 --> 01:09:08,138
Many many times in concussions, if you give Arnica immediately you dispense with all the problems

294
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:11,358
that the patient may have for years.

295
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:13,760
You just clear it.

296
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:24,258
Because in the beginning the extravasation of blood starts, you give Arnica immediately stops the blood coming out

297
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:30,901
 and absorbs the blood which is outside and clears the case.

298
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:50,120
But you have to give high potency in such case. 10M, 50M, CM. 50M is a good potency.

299
01:09:52,160 --> 01:10:04,608
Once I was going on a bus, I was getting up in a bus quickly and somebody else was coming with a steal frame

300
01:10:04,670 --> 01:10:12,760
and she was going down with the steel frame,
 I was going down and she hit me on my knee.

301
01:10:12,890 --> 01:10:23,808
I got into the bus and I was fainting from pain; I asked the bus driver to stop.

302
01:10:23,870 --> 01:10:36,458
I stayed in the street there and I tried to get a taxi because I was fainting all the time. I was trying not to faint.

303
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:54,938
And the taxi brought me outside of my home and I just managed to get inside my home with this severe pain, unbearable.

304
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:07,240
 And I grasped a dose of Arnica 50M. I put it there and in a minute  like miracle, the pain disappeared.

305
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:19,189
 Then you need Arnica. But it is wrong if with little injuries, you take Arnica.

306
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:30,608
This is not correct. If you have a strong injury you use these potencies. If you have a small injury, forget it.

307
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:49,483
Symmetrical eruptions, Arnica is famous but there are a lot of other remedies that have this symmetrical eruption.

308
01:11:52,800 --> 01:12:09,498
Heart infraction, we use Arnica in brain stroke, in heart infarction especially when the patient does not want

309
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:16,640
to be approached by others, fear of coming near.

310
01:12:38,989 --> 01:12:58,640
So the pillow feels hard, eructation and diarrhoea smell of spoiled eggs very characteristic

311
01:12:58,702 --> 01:13:03,890
and of course after injuries with blunt instrument.

312
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:20,298
Sometimes people use this, homeopaths, use Arnica they say, you go to the dentist take Arnica to prevent the pain. This is wrong.

313
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:33,378
Take Arnica as a preventive. This is wrong. There is no indication for Arnica. When the tooth is extracted

314
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:47,351
always there is blood running out. The blood has to stay inside enclosed and then the severe pain  starts

315
01:13:50,910 --> 01:13:55,900
and then Arnica is indicated.

316
01:14:01,387 --> 01:14:12,138
The same after extraction of tooth, Arnica is not indicated. They say, 'oh it did me good'.

317
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:18,840
Of course it will be good whether
 you took Arnica of did not take Arnica.

318
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:37,758
No before operation. Arnica in order to act has to have its own symptoms. Otherwise don't give it.

319
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:54,528
You spoil the remedy. By giving too many homeopathic remedies for little reasons, you spoil the possibility

320
01:14:54,590 --> 01:15:07,563
 of that person to react correctly in the correct remedy. There is no need to give remedy for little things, especially little injuries.

321
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:18,549
Don't use Arnica for little things, use Arnica for real problems. When there is a concussion and the person is in a coma,

322
01:15:19,450 --> 01:15:33,548
you speak to him and you see he answered and then back, 50M Arnica, he will come out of the coma within minutes.

323
01:15:34,090 --> 01:15:38,670
What about Arnica after birth?

324
01:15:41,820 --> 01:15:56,188
After birth there is a possibility of a rupture of the perineum. In this case, no Arnica is indicated.

325
01:15:56,250 --> 01:16:10,738
Maybe if the symptoms of Arnica are there, yes. If there is no rupture and there is severe pain left over, Arnica can be indicated.

326
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:16,880
But if there is rupture and then pain, no Arnica.
