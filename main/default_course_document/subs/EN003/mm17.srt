1
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:43,347
Cham. is a reactive remedy. Reaction immediately and the reaction is always a bad reaction.

2
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:53,247
Why? Because they feel the pain. The sense of pain for Cham. is very acute.

3
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:06,347
It seems that the organism does not produce the necessary opiates to calm down the pain.

4
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:19,557
You see some people can stand a lot of pain. And some others, less. Cham., the least.

5
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:27,877
The idea of pain makes them react.

6
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:42,680
And pain makes them also angry

7
00:01:49,650 --> 00:02:04,327
it's much more than irritability. When you have a patient and the nurse goes to the patient and takes some tea

8
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:19,730
 to the patient and the irritability is so much that he will find something wrong with the nurse to shout at her and throw a tantrum.

9
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:32,147
So the need is to express this irritability, this anger which is inside Cham.

10
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:48,357
The children are irritated in their gums when the teeth are coming out and are breaking through.

11
00:02:48,360 --> 00:03:00,857
Some of the Cham. cases, they cry day and night, they don't know what is wrong with them and the only thing

12
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:11,080
that can calm them down is to take the child and carry it.

13
00:03:11,183 --> 00:03:18,487
For the child this works like magic for Cham.

14
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:28,747
You have to move the child like this and walk. This calms them down, why?

15
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:37,047
We don't know the physiology, you can theorize. But we're interested in the fact. This is happening?

16
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:48,307
Yes, it's Cham. The mother will say, I have to take the child in my lap and walk around, lullaby it. It calms down.

17
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:51,920
You put it down, ouahh...

18
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,557
Very good translator!

19
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:30,167
-Not a question but a contribution. It has been demonstrated that rhythmic motions of the body produce an increase

20
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:36,650
of endorphins. This has been shown in mentally retarded.

21
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:55,297
You know that the Sufis have special rhythmic dances which they do before meditation or instead of meditation.

22
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:07,817
Most probably they have done the research and found out that this rhythmic movement produces it.

23
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:17,887
In the same way, you may say the rhythmic movement of the mind.

24
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:28,377
In the Greek Orthodox church when they pray, they say the prayer of the heart.

25
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:34,887
The prayer of the heart is the repetition of a specific phrase.

26
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:58,077
And then you can see in the teachings of other religions and especially in the Indian religions also they have the japa

27
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,857
 the repetition of sacred words.

28
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:17,277
And most probably this rhythmic movement of the mind, it calms down the mind and more opiates are produced

29
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:32,517
and then the state of ecstasy comes. The state in which the individual feels really in contact with the higher forces

30
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:41,017
 intelligence, God, whatever they do call it. It's very interesting contribution, thank you.

31
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:51,277
Is this a research done in a hospital?

32
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:05,597
-It's a research that was conducted with mentally retarded people because they do a lot of stereotypic movements

33
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:11,617
 shaking the upper body by themselves.

34
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:21,520
- So it reduces, Hell. reduces most probably the level of anxiety by doing this.

35
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:37,167
-It is as well being researched in marathon, in jogging people, in a big study.

36
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:41,117
It's the same that the endorphin production goes up very high.

37
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:50,777
-But marathon runners do they do some repetition of words? I want to win, I want to win.

38
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:06,357
-Some of them run 100 km, it's a rhythm.
-Oh, the rhythmic movement by itself.

39
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:20,960
Also with Sepia, this can be explained by Sepia that needs a specific movement to feel better on which we shall be talking about.

40
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:54,057
 Dissatisfaction is not the right world. They have dissatisfaction and malicious at the same time.

41
00:08:54,060 --> 00:09:08,327
They are malicious, irritable, dissatisfied together. Nasty they are very nasty and strangely behaving.

42
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:24,887
Cham. persons will not be satisfied even for 5 minutes the whole day. There is something wrong all the time

43
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:32,640
and they have to express it, and they find the least reason to express and to explode.

44
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:48,137
So you see this peculiarity, how it is expressed in the face. It says, the one cheek is red and the other is pale.

45
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,887
The one is hot and the other is cold.

46
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:04,160
This is a peculiar symptom. One ear is red and the other is not.

47
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:26,067
Which is the other remedy which has also great sensitivity to pain? Hepar Sulphur.

48
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:41,090
Which is the remedy which feels least the pain? Opium.

49
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:51,837
You see Opium is heavy, sleep, ecstasy all the time.

50
00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:02,437
In Opium you may get conditions that you don't believe that the people don't feel pain.

51
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:13,157
-Seven years ago I had this very bad car accident and all the legs were destroyed and everything was fractured.

52
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:18,697
 I didn't feel any pain, I thought I was paralyzed. There was no pain.

53
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:23,797
-For how long? For 1 hour?
-No, for 2 days but they gave me Opium right away.

54
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,077
They said I wouldn't have survived without Opium.

55
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:31,067
-They gave you Opium, that's why you did not feel pain?

56
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:35,567
-No, I didn't feel any pain after this accident.
-Before Opium.

57
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:43,957
-Yes. He came to visit me and he saw the situation, he gave me Opium right away. I was unconscious.

58
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,717
Two hours I was conscious and that time I didn't feel any pain.

59
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:54,557
-You were given homeopathic Opium high potency. I see.

60
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:19,197
I have seen cases where the skin has gone out, the whole body is a bed sore, when they lie in the same position

61
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:26,080
 the Opium snoring.

62
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:43,307
You feel the opiates. You say, 'how do you feel?'. They say, 'good! and you see legs are broken and he says good?

63
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:53,760
Now the Cham. is exactly the opposite.

64
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:12,687
You get a little child, he has some eczema here on the neck or on the face or somewhere and you try to just put this.

65
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,050
He makes like this.

66
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:31,060
They do it before you touch them. You say, do you feel pain? He looks because he cannot say if he feels pain.

67
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:36,880
That is aversion to be touched.

68
00:13:51,600 --> 00:14:16,087
Also Cham. will be the remedy for dental pains of any type as long as they are strong, they look like nerve pains

69
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:25,617
and they are aggravated with any change of the temperature of the mouth. Worse with cold or warm.

70
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:34,350
 They cannot stand any temperature in the mouth. The pain is unbearable.

71
00:14:54,190 --> 00:15:09,417
Arn. and Cham. have this smell of rotten eggs in the stool, in the mouth, in the saliva, in the discharges.

72
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:16,317
Have you ever smelt rotten egg?

73
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:27,190
Who has not smelt rotten egg? Only 4 people.

74
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:38,430
The smell of sulphuric acid yes.

75
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:20,717
You're treating a case of bronchitis and the aggravation comes 9 in the morning.

76
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:37,927
You will be thinking of Bry. and Cham. How you can differentiate? Very easily.

77
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:43,200
The one is very quiet, the other is very noisy.

78
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:58,027
A Bry. child, the mother will say, such a good girl. She sits there, she doesn't talk, she doesn't move.

79
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:03,840
For this child the mother says, this is a devil.

80
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:25,357
Hot sweat on head. The sweat is always hot unless it is very peculiar which the sweat is cold and we have the Calc.

81
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:32,287
Usually the sweat is hot. There is no sweat which is cold, unless it is Calc.

82
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,520
But if it is very hot then it is impressive.

83
00:17:56,030 --> 00:18:05,917
Stools like hot chopped eggs and spinach  is the sum of the diarrhea that you may see in the small ones, in the small children.

84
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:28,267
So what you have to see is the sensitivity to pain, the total denial of communication. He doesn't want to be told

85
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:38,997
 he doesn't want to be touched or interfered. They don't know what is wrong with them. You may give them something

86
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:54,040
 they throw it out and at 9 o'clock aggravation, in the morning or evening, severe reaction to pain. This is Cham.

87
00:18:55,530 --> 00:19:02,140
 These are the basic things of Cham. You don't have to remember anything else.

88
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,527
You'll recognize the Cham. immediately if you remember just that.

89
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:20,280
For Cham. you go to the Materia Medica, you have pages and pages and pages of symptoms. How can you remember it?

90
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:34,017
-Can you please give me any differentiation in the emotional plane with Cina?

91
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:57,887
-The main differentiation is that Cina is not so sensitive to pain. Cina will not react because of the pain.

92
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:18,157
Cina is the idea of the worms eating you up, eating your nervous system,

93
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:27,180
like you have worms that are touching your nervous system. How you would feel? You will never feel at ease.

94
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:39,117
You will feel some kind of irritation in the nervous system that makes you react in such a way. Capriciousness.

95
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:59,837
It is not so much the anger. It's the capriciousness there, and the sensitivity to pain. This remedy can have big outburst of anger.

96
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:37,657
For Kali-bi. you have to remember its main characteristic, stickiness.

97
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:55,437
The mind, the emotions and the physical discharges. Whatever comes out it's sticky.

98
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:05,437
Thoughts are sticky. Sticky thoughts is when somebody is explaining to you something and it takes long time

99
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:16,487
he repeats all the time and it's a sticky person. And then feelings are sticky. The person is expressing feelings

100
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:24,747
and then you have the impression that you have enough. OK, what do you want?

101
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:40,357
They don't say, they keep on expressing emotions and love and thoughts which are sticky. It's very difficult to explain.

102
00:22:55,210 --> 00:23:12,937
You know in the physical level what you will see is for instance the pus from a tumor. You try to open a tumor

103
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:28,680
and you take it out and you see the pus is coming out like this, in a cord. Like a hair.

104
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:40,267
The pus is sticky, the discharge from the nose is sticky. And then it goes down.

105
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:51,787
You vomit and there are sticky matters that they go down.

106
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:08,730
Unbelievably sticky.

107
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:29,677
I remember one of my teachers in India was BK Bose. By the time I was there he was 85 and he was a direct pupil of Kent.

108
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:41,617
That's why I went to the Calcutta college. He was teaching there just to meet him and hear what he has to say.

109
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:53,310
 He had to say very little because he was 85. Don't come to learn from me, if I'm still alive.

110
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:23,000
He had that story where Kent was examining a case of gangrene, where it was quite progressed and he lifted

111
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:42,840
the matter like that and he said ok Kali-bi. 10M. Without asking any questions. He said this man with active gangrene

112
00:25:42,843 --> 00:25:49,060
will take Kali-bi. and the case was cured.

113
00:25:49,063 --> 00:26:03,480
We all have seen such cases, gangrene cases expecially. Some of them develop after severe diabetes

114
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:17,367
long standing diabetes, or because of infections. And the homeopathic remedies help very much in this condition.

115
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:36,357
Another interesting case that I remember is about myself. One time I got up in the middle of the night with

116
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:53,437
severe pain in the stomach and the tendency to vomit and to faint. I tried to go to the kitchen from the bedroom

117
00:26:53,440 --> 00:27:05,217
in the meantime my wife woke up, but I realized I couldn't reach the kitchen and I came back and said to my wife

118
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:10,320
'don't worry, I will faint for half and hour'.

119
00:27:10,323 --> 00:27:24,990
It was 2-3 in the morning and I thought that if I faint for few minutes and won't come back my wife will start calling

120
00:27:24,993 --> 00:27:33,277
all kinds of doctors and ambulance and I didn't want any ambulance and any of the doctors to come and give me what?

121
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:44,320
You never know. I said I'll faint for half and hour. I calculated it's not possible to stay for half and hour.

122
00:27:44,623 --> 00:27:55,760
If she waits for half an hour I will be back and I know what to do. So I fainted, and after a few minutes I came back

123
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:09,317
and then I asked for a basin to throw up. As I was throwing up this cord was appearing and I said to her

124
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:22,400
bring me Kali-bi. 10M. I took the Kali-bi. and in 2-3 minutes I was asleep. The whole incident was over.

125
00:28:22,403 --> 00:28:33,000
It was a food poisoning. I'm prone to food poisoning because I don't pay any attention what I drink what I take.

126
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:56,560
I had it several times with Coca cola esp. if I combine it with mince meat, sauce. I get such poisonous

127
00:28:56,563 --> 00:29:03,560
conditions that I have fainted several times. One of these times it was this one.

128
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:15,540
 You see I have so many experiences myself apart from seeing the patient that I say, I live because of Homeopathy.

129
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:27,877
There is no question about that. That's why I devoted my time into teaching because if you would see

130
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:42,887
pictures of me when I was 20, I was looking very ill, I was very sick as a child. Not as a small child but after the war

131
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:53,517
 because we did not have anything to eat. We grew up with eating spinach, without anything else.

132
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:23,917
Anyhow I was with bad health and one of these people programmed to live 30-40 years, so I got a lease of another 25 already.

133
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:37,850
I am outlaw.

134
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:59,990
Another keynote for Kali-bi. is pain in small spots.

135
00:30:59,993 --> 00:31:19,967
You get a spot like this in the back. It says 'here, here'. It doesn't reflect or extend. It is very painful and in one point.

136
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:30,600
You get it wherever you may get this kind of pain localized without extension the first remedy is Kali-bi.

137
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:47,610
Now you get here the wrong impression.

138
00:31:47,613 --> 00:32:05,437
The small spot pain doesn't move. But if you get arthritic pains, these pains they move, they go along like which other remedy?

139
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:27,137
Like Berb. and like also Puls. and like Form.

140
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:46,977
These are the main remedies that we have to be thinking so it's not a small spot which goes here and then here, no.

141
00:32:46,980 --> 00:33:00,247
These small spot pains remain on one place usually. They are pressure on the roots of the nerves.

142
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:22,007
It's very severe and very persistent problem. The problems of Kali's in general are persistent problems, are deep problems.

143
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:40,037
And here also we have a remedy which combines symptoms of arthritis and rheumatoarthritic pains

144
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:56,037
 together with skin eruptions. And alternation of skin eruption or suppression of skin eruption and then rheumatic pains

145
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:02,560
 Dulcamara and also this remedy should be considered.

146
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:21,060
Cracking in joints, rheumatic pains in joints.

147
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:34,077
And also all the Kali's are remedies which affect the respiratory system.

148
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:44,757
Kali-bi. is one of the main remedies for uppermost part of the respiratory which is the sinuses.

149
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:53,540
Sinusitis whether it's frontal sinusitis

150
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:15,310
or maxillary sinusitis, especially if there is a lot of discharge; it doesn't have to be sticky  as long as it is a lot.

151
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:27,277
A key question is 'when do you have this discharge, in the morning, in the afternoon, in the evening?'

152
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:37,040
 He says, 'anytime I blow my nose I have discharge'. This is a typical answer for Kali-bi.

153
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:53,297
 You can understand they are feeling full of mucus in this area and their nose  is almost always blocked

154
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:58,397
 with mucus and they have to blow, to open and so they can breathe.

155
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:10,277
-Do they have postnasal discharge?
-A lot of postnasal discharge and Kali-bi. are chronic cases.

156
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:16,120
The sinusitis eventually they have to operate.

157
00:36:16,123 --> 00:36:28,927
You get this proper sinusitis, chronic sinusitis case where the sinuses always congested with a lot of pus inside.

158
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:35,930
 You take the X-rays, you see the inflammation for years and years and they're going like this.

159
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:44,757
Eventually you say they have to be operated. Of course after a few years starts again.

160
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:49,107
The sinusitis doesn't stop because you are operated.

161
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:56,617
-I'm sorry I didn't quite catch about the small spot pains. Do you say that it's wrong what is written?

162
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:12,827
-No. In the way it's written it says, small spot pains which shift rapidly, this is wrong. The small spot stay

163
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:23,350
but there are other pains that shift from here, there, there, arthritic pains, rheumatic pains yes.

164
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:39,249
-Also these Kali-bi. people stick to the family, they never go on vacation alone. Do you have this experience?

165
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:53,977
-Yes this is true. They are people who stick with the partner, they are not people that will play around

166
00:37:53,980 --> 00:38:03,717
they are serious people, lawyers, managers of the banks, the establishment.

167
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:18,237
They stick where is the best and they like to have the best. Best food, they like beer but if they do drink beer they have problems.

168
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:34,237
They have colitis, dyspnea. This remedy when we says it affects the respiratory, mostly the sinusitis, it doesn't mean

169
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:47,717
that you will find it only in sinusitis. You will find it also in chronic bronchitis, in asthmatic bronchitis, you will find all these conditions

170
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:58,237
and the aggravation of Kali-bi. which is in the middle of the night.

171
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:10,510
They wake up at 2-3-4 o'clock, dyspnea.

172
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:22,837
-I wish to ask you about this shifting of the spot pains.

173
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:36,077
-Shifting on the pointed pain is wrong, it doesn't move. The pain stays.

174
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:52,877
-My question is, I saw many cases from Geukens with such pains and they wander. One day in this place,

175
00:39:52,880 --> 00:40:02,597
the other day in another place. Not quickly but they are wandering these pains in small spots.

176
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:12,157
They were also abdominal pains, different kind of pains, muscular pains and so on.

177
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:23,637
- Mostly muscular pains which can be moving. These small spot pains which I mean are pains which are due to

178
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:36,757
pressure on the roots of the nerve. And these pains stay there, they are not superficial pains. They are severe pains

179
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:47,077
that will stay in one spot. They are other kind of pains which are muscular, which are on the muscle

180
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:52,567
and which are possible to move around.

181
00:40:55,810 --> 00:41:01,997
-Is there any color of the discharge of the sinusitis?

182
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:12,997
-The color of the discharge preferably is yellowish but not necessary.

183
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:22,517
Somebody was telling the other day concerning Hyper. He says, I did not give Hyper. because the pains were not shooting up.

184
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:32,247
No, you don't have to have all these conditions. You have a trauma on the peripheral nervous system, Hyper. is indicated.

185
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:43,767
Of course you have an inflammation here which shoots up the pain, also Hyper. is indicated.

186
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:18,917
Yes but it's not the only remedy which has spots. Oxalic acid also has small spot pains. But you have to have some kind

187
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:23,940
 of confirmation, at least the second or the third symptom.

188
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:55,997
Hair-like sensation in the back of the tongue. This is also characteristic to another remedy and it is Sil.

189
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:05,257
A sensation that hair is stuck in the back of the tongue. It's almost a constant sensation.

190
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:15,117
Little things like that make big difference in your prescription.

191
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:48,327
Usually it is a cold remedy, so it is better with warm but not very warm. Ars. can stand a lot of warm and she will not object.

192
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:07,247
Desire for beer but worse from beer.

193
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,097
-Did you see also warm type of Kali-bi.?

194
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:34,557
-I can't remember now but it is not impossible if the other things are there. Just because the person

195
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,037
is aggravated a little bit from warm.

196
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:53,077
And don't forget, as I have said, that most of the cases they have several layers.

197
00:44:55,810 --> 00:45:15,560
This is Kali-bi. Here is sinusitis and here also is rheumatic conditions. But the underlying remedy from this, is Sulphur.

198
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:25,080
And Sulphur symptom comes up while the whole picture looks like Kali-bi. you have a Sulphur symptom here.

199
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:36,187
 He says, I'm warm. You give Kali-bi. and then what happens?

200
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:45,400
It takes away that picture but it stays there and then you see how strong it appears that symptom?

201
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:55,157
The underlying symptom that was popping up in the first place now it has become quite strong in the next layer.

202
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:58,337
That means you have done your job.

203
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:06,567
But if you have given Sulphur on the beginning, the second layer, forget it.

204
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:13,327
 You aggravate the whole situation without bringing about a cure.

205
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:36,097
- I don't understand how it is aggravated in summer if it is a cold remedy?

206
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:47,557
-If it is a cold remedy of course in summer they will not say, I feel cold but you ask them, how you feel in comparison with others?

207
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:56,087
A cold remedy will describe to you that they are wearing a jacket when others are wearing only a shirt.

208
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:22,397
-The aggravation of Kali-bi. with its rheumatic pains can be during summer time?

209
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:27,420
If it is a cold remedy why do they have an aggravation on summer which is usually warm?

210
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:35,660
-Because the reason for the aggravation it can be exertion, it can be any other reason.

211
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:51,037
Also in asthmatic conditions it doesn't matter whether it's cold or winter or summer, they will continue having

212
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:56,037
the aggravation in 2,3, 4 o'clock in the morning.

213
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:10,440
The amelioration does not mean that the symptomatology goes away totally because of an amelioration.

214
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:30,717
It is a very relative issue, amelioration from drinking cold water. It is momentary amelioration. Amelioration of the cough

215
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:36,117
 when you eat something. It is a momentary amelioration.

216
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:42,647
After a while cough starts again and continues.

217
00:48:46,200 --> 00:49:01,647
And sometimes we have aggravations and ameliorations in a whole season. This is different. Aggravation during spring.

218
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:06,157
Aggravation during autumn. During winter.

219
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,320
Which is aggravation during winter?

220
00:49:10,323 --> 00:49:26,920
Petroleum. Aggravation during winter the first remedy you are thinking is Petroleum.

221
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:07,870
-I had a patient 3 weeks ago who suffered from a strong sinusitis.

222
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:16,487
Since 2 months she could not breath through the nose anymore

223
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:31,320
 and the doctor constantly prescribed antibiotics.

224
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:47,097
She had developed a strong itching because of the penicillin and came to me in this state.

225
00:50:55,450 --> 00:51:02,960
Then she had this stringy discharge which was running down her throat

226
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:27,640
and I gave her Kali-bi. and we kept on talking  for a short while and after 10 minutes she said, wait a minute it's all gone.

227
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:52,957
I had seen her that night around 8 p.m. and after she took the remedy that night at about 2 in the morning

228
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:59,547
she woke up with a strong rash in the face.

229
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:11,537
She went to the hospital because she did not know what to do and they gave her cortisone.

230
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:34,477
I had given her a C30 diluted in water and after 2 days it was better with her sinusitis.

231
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:46,437
My question is, was this reaction due to Kali-bi.?

232
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:56,897
-Yes sure. It was a very good reaction and it was because of the Kali-bi.

233
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:09,037
-But she could not had developed some kind of shock?

234
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:23,177
-No shock under homeopathic remedy. The shock is there but it is curative, it's a curative shock.

235
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:43,040
She could have had a reaction with her bronchi, a reaction like dyspnea between 2-3 and still the reaction is curative.
