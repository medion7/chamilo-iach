1
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:28,590
We have fear of death and panic, tremendous panic.

2
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:42,590
And a sense that death is coming. It's imminent. In the books it says that predicts the time of death.

3
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:57,521
This is in acute conditions. In chronic conditions you will not find that he will say, 10 o'clock I will die, we have another situation.

4
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:17,301
All the symptoms will not occur in one individual. With some individuals we shall have fear of death

5
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:26,680
vertigo, fear of fainting and intense tachycardia.

6
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:45,349
With other people we may have trembling, perspiration, urinating numbness, such as numbness of the half of the face.

7
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:58,470
Another group of patients may experience a
kind of psychogenic dyspnea like Lobelia.

8
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,130
And they need to take a deep breath.

9
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:25,330
Or we may have flushes of heat on the
whole body or especially in the head.

10
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:36,960
There is general aggravation time and
 this is most frequently in the night.

11
00:02:37,317 --> 00:02:44,720
Especially from midnight to 4 a.m.

12
00:02:44,779 --> 00:02:52,780
 And generalyl we have an aggravation from heat.

13
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:05,991
But sometimes aggravation from cold as well. 80% of the times is heat and 20% is cold.

14
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:20,381
And the crisis can be precipitated by heat, when they are heated up in a very warm room.

15
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,541
Now you see this individual with intense fear pounding tachycardia etc.

16
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:46,124
When the crisis come then that is the violence, the intensity, then there is the panic, there is the fear, all these are very intense.

17
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:53,421
When you converse to him, when he describes to you, he will not describe it with this intensity but he will say

18
00:03:53,480 --> 00:04:02,990
is 'I'm going to die', he has tremendous fear of death.

19
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:32,271
So these patients are very sympathetic as we said. They need company and also they express their feelings easily.

20
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:46,981
This sympathetic element leads to a state of anxiety about others. They are concerned very much about

21
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:56,280
 their relatives, their friends and they react out of proportion to something that is happening to a friend or relative.

22
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:07,941
What happened to you? Oh my God. The reaction is out of proportion to an event.

23
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:20,440
Because of that element they do not like to hear bad news. They have ailments from bad news.

24
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:32,791
You see there are certain rubrics in the Repertory that we do not see them in the patient, 'ailments from bad news'

25
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:37,221
we do not see that. You have to see the whole person.

26
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:46,021
I mean a crisis comes so many times, intense, the fear of death, perspiration, tachycardia etc.

27
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:56,471
Then they go out, they are sympathetic. It's the whole picture that will make a person Aconite.

28
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:07,461
Anxiety about other people. You have anxiety about others? Yes. You see it's an information which is useless.

29
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:15,557
What we're interested is to get the personality, the essence. Is that Aconite case?

30
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:37,631
And that is why we give the Materia Medica in this way, to make it alive. He says he is anxious about health, but he has not. Can't you see? He does not care.

31
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:48,861
In Greece for instance, the doctor asks 'are you sympathetic?'.' Yes very sympathetic'. Underlined 3 times.

32
00:06:48,920 --> 00:07:09,345
All Greeks are sympathetic. Ok, this is not a symptom because it is a quality that everybody has and feels....

33
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:31,541
Sympathetic is a symptom when the person is really suffering because of the suffering of the others.

34
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:38,600
And he cannot control himself.

35
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:52,311
The sympathetic is you want to put is as a symptom has to be really suffering because of others and cannot help it.

36
00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:17,901
I mean if a woman has a child, she is always sympathetic but a Phosphorus woman or the Aconite woman or the Sulphur woman will react completely different.

37
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:38,061
The Aconite in the Repertory says 'anxiety about others'. In Aconite we have an eruption and he says 'what happened, oh my God, what shall we do?'. It's an eruption and the anxiety about other is intense.

38
00:08:38,120 --> 00:09:04,030
 The Phosphorus has completely different. The Phos will act if everything is ok. He shows all the affection, all the concern, he is interested about you.

39
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:26,541
The Sulphur will not show it, the anxiety. The Sulphur will say, the child is late. It's usually coming at 12-1. They stay awake, they cannot sleep until they hear the door.

40
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:47,611
12.20 maybe he had an accident? And they get up from bed and they walk up and down, going in the veranda, watching the child coming.

41
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:52,611
Once they see the child coming, they will go back in sleep.

42
00:09:53,710 --> 00:10:09,947
The Phosphorus do not take this so much imagination. When he faces something which is very bad then he becomes very sympathetic.

43
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:25,115
Each remedy shows the sympathy in a different way, the Arsenicum also has anxiety about others. Anxiety about others in Arsenicum is inner anxiety.

44
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:36,684
Whom others? Those that he is connected and he feels a kind of security having them, the father, the mother, the brother. What happened to my brother?

45
00:10:36,784 --> 00:10:44,581
Because he holds on him and so he wants him to be well in order to help him in case he's not feeling well etc.

46
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:58,831
It is an anxiety on a reflex where he wants the support from others and he wants others to be well to support him.

47
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:10,541
It's a different thing in attitude, in personality. Anxiety about others it's underlined 3 times.

48
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:24,400
It doesn't say anything. It is not type of anxiety, is it the Phos anxiety, the Ars, the Sulph, the Calc anxiety?

49
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,841
So this we are interested to understand.

50
00:11:49,960 --> 00:12:05,021
In the acute state we said the fear of death, that he is going to die now within half an hour, 1,2 hours whatever it is, but now.

51
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:25,061
In chronic states the fear of death that is imminent it appears to be within a span of time, let's say in 3, 5 months, in 1 year 'the way I am, my heart is going to give in and I'm going to die'.

52
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:32,971
They are actually sure that they are going to die and they make preparation.

53
00:12:34,250 --> 00:13:05,800
They make their will and then they tell you that through the symptoms 'I'm absolutely sure that very soon my heart will stop and I'll die. Therefore I have to arrange everything that after my death everything will be taken care'.

54
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:39,230
 He is a prudent man he's just thinking about his death etc. Here we take into consideration everything which is pathological. It's not natural, it's not healthy for one to think that in 3, 5 months I'm going to die.

55
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:47,440
This is pathology and we take it in consideration.

56
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:24,300
Except from the fear of death, Aconite produces  also claustrophobia, fear of dark and especially fear of crowds.

57
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:32,330
Many times he will not sleep without the light on.

58
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:50,157
And he will not go through tunels if he knows that the lift is going through tunel he prefers to get up and go 5 storeys walking but will not go into the lift.

59
00:14:53,040 --> 00:15:06,381
Also you will not get an Aconite going into demonstration, when too many people are in the streets.

60
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:15,080
And they have also a fear of accident.

61
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:29,560
So much so that many times an Aconite will
not drive by himself. In order to drive they
need somebody else to accompany them.

62
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:38,800
Also Aconite has many times fear of disease and has to be added, it's not in the Repertory.

63
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:50,560
And also fear that his heart will stop beating.

64
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:05,491
It appears that those fears are gone and there is the least provocation, and then they come up.

65
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:15,161
In some cases there is an aggravation which reminds you of Lachesis.

66
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:29,961
And that is when they go to bed and they sleep for 10-15 minutes, then suddenly they wake up with tremendous fears, they jump up.

67
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:51,101
Now the difference is that with Lachesis the fear is not a fear of death; it's a fear of suffocation when they're falling asleep. By the time they go into sleep.

68
00:16:51,160 --> 00:17:05,271
 Aconite is a fear of death, is a panic which comes 10-15 minutes after sleep. You see the difference? It looks alike, you may confuse it but it's not the same.

69
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:22,621
It is 10-15 minutes, that means the person has gone into sleep and the moment that the logic mind has gone away, the fears that have been staying inside, they start suddenly.

70
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:32,440
And in such an intensity  that the person jumps up and he feels he is going to die.

71
00:17:48,613 --> 00:18:05,380
Also there is an aggravation from heat. He may explain it that he is getting warm in bed, that heat aggravates him and brings the crisis of the panic.

72
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:21,150
Sometimes these fears instead of making the person to wake up, they appear as nightmares.  So they go through tremendous nightmares.

73
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:38,192
And another fear that can come about is a kind of "mora". You know what is a "mora"? No. I will describe to you.

74
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:49,240
 When they try to wake up or they wake up without being able to move their limb. What's called this?

75
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:05,301
This can happen with Aconite. They wake up, they cannot move their limbs and they go into a state of fright and panic.

76
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:32,230
Anyhow what we observe in general is that
 the fears that have been engrafted in the subconscious mind, they surface very easily
the Aconite people and they bring out these states of panic and fear.

77
00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:00,411
The Aconite is also the number 1 remedy that is affected by earthquakes.

78
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:17,390
And it is an analogous state inside, like an earthquake happening. Inside the circulatory system is in such a turmoil as if an earthquake is taking place inside.

79
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:41,710
Sometimes the feeling of the earthquake inside is so strong that they wake up and they feel that
the ceiling may fall on them. They have the impression that there is actually an earthquake.

80
00:20:51,740 --> 00:21:02,200
It's a tremendous commotion inside. These states are going on and on. I have seen a state of Aconite which is terrifying.

81
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:36,520
One of the time of aggravations of Aconite is this time, the twilight. And I've seen a case of Aconite in a state of agony coming every night when the twilight comes, where the person will go into tremendous fear and will sob in a such a way as barking.

82
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:44,911
Terrified, full of fear, not being able to express anything at the moment.

83
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:55,741
It was terrible experience once that a doctor had. He took the patient inside and while he was in the consulting room, it was about this time

84
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:08,280
the person started the interview and then suddenly that syndrome came and it was so intense that the doctor was terrified.

85
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:26,291
He said, 'come in I cannot handle the situation'. With this syndrome they would call usually the ambulance and give her injection, valium.

86
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:31,480
It was terrible, the fear.

87
00:22:54,360 --> 00:23:05,231
With one dose of Aconite not only that crisis went away. It went away the whole. I mean this woman she was getting very frequently this attack.

88
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:21,871
So Aconite states can start from a million places like tachycardias, numbness etc and then we see the fear, fear of death, panic tremendous panic and then these terrific fears

89
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:36,940
 which come indescribable, they cannot say what happens to them and most probably they feel the death is imminent. That they are going to die and they take them to the ambulance.

90
00:23:54,610 --> 00:24:15,821
The claustrophobia also. I remember another case where the claustrophobia was so much
that if in the house they were 6 or 7 persons,
she would feel claustrophobic.

91
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:28,341
And she could not stay in that room. She had to leave. Therefore they say, I cannot invite my relatives in the house. With 6-7 people she felt claustrophobia.

92
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:34,160
So you understand the intensity of the claustrophobia.

93
00:24:40,795 --> 00:24:51,500
Also there is a fear of suffocation, esp. in warm colsed places.

94
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:02,941
And sometimes you will get a fear of open spaces. It's the opposite, exactly.

95
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:23,160
They cannot drive into the autobahn. They can drive in the city, they can go anywhere. As soon as they come in the autobahn where the space is open, they go into a panic, into a fear. They paralyze, they cannot drive anymore.

96
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:38,370
They cannot say why this is happening. They go into panic and they cannot explain why.

97
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:45,411
I'll give you some characteristics of the different systems. In the head:

98
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:55,360
In general we can say there are tormenting sensations in the head.

99
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:12,770
Tormenting headaches and vertigo. There is contraction often and fullness often accompanied by great heat.

100
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:21,712
There is a very characteristic sensation of voiding inside the head.

101
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:48,120
There are headaches which can come about after fright or after exposure to cold, dry winds. And this with cold, dry winds is characteristic of Aconite.

102
00:27:51,560 --> 00:28:04,040
The headaches are located mostly in occiput and forehead. One sided numbness of the face, as we said before

103
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:14,110
These headaches usually are accompanied by some kind of fear, fear of death.

104
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:36,560
Most probably Aconite will be indicated in a lot of cases with this tremendous fear, this upheaval.

105
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:47,470
 The fever is very high, the headache is very strong.

106
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:57,050
When we have severe cases of encephalitis and encephalomyelitis.

107
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:26,241
In the beginning of such cases we do not have frequently the possibility to treat such cases unfortunately but from my experience

108
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:42,170
I've seen that Homeopathy definitely can work and ensure better. We do not have the statistics yet that it can work better than antibiotics.

109
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:50,020
I have seen some dramatic cases in children recovered.

110
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:59,661
-Have you seen meningitis with good results?
-Yes.

111
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:13,581
The problem we cannot see many cases to have such statistics. We see cases of the child of my sister or the doctors who are in the center, their children.

112
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:22,131
The children are connected very much with Homeopathy and their parents know very well about Homeopathy.

113
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:36,361
This is the only time where you can take such responsibility. Also I don't suggest to take such cases especially when we are not medical doctors.

114
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:50,670
You don't know what to do if the remedy has failed. You may have a difficult situation.

115
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:14,080
It's also indicated in conjuctivitis esp. when this inflammation of the conjuctiva has come about after the exposure to cold wind.

116
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:22,120
An inflammation becomes soon cured.

117
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:38,440
The eyes become very sensitive to light and there is great photophobia.  To sunlight and artificial light.

118
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:58,960
 Also Aconite may be used sudden loss of sight after fright. If you have sudden loss of sight after fright you can be thinking of Aconite.

119
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:15,991
In the stomach you can have gastritis inflammation which will come about if somebody is over heated and drinks very cold water suddenly.

120
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:24,840
Then comes this burning in the stomach and the gastritis starts. Then Aconite is one of the remedies you have to think.

121
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:40,051
Also they have great thirst. Especially on waking in the morning.

122
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:06,480
In the abdomen you will find characteristic pains in the abdomen which extend to the chest.

123
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:35,600
Also retention of urine after a fright.

124
00:33:35,659 --> 00:33:58,450
The Aconite is very much used in case of a newborn because of the fright coming out to the world. If the urine is retained then Aconite is one of the main remedies.

125
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:06,850
Sudden bronchitis.

126
00:34:06,909 --> 00:34:18,720
 Sudden inflammation of the ovaries in cases of suppressed menses.

127
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:41,010
But all these symptoms are very well described in Kent and this is one of the remedies he gave in all these details.

128
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:52,721
But I would say we are using Aconite say 80% in chronic cases and 20% in acute.

129
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:14,421
We have hundreds of cases treated with Aconite for 5 years, 10 years, chronic cases. Especially of this type I described to you.

130
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:25,640
 Before we knew this remedy we would give Lachesis, Kali arsenicum, Belladonna, all other kinds of remedies that were not acting.

131
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:37,161
  And when we came out with the Aconite picture, then we had a great friend in all situations.

132
00:35:51,730 --> 00:36:01,370
All these symptoms the tachycardia, the vertigo, the headaches, the fainting they are not functional, pathological.

133
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:21,121
-I had a case where this lady she would wake up at night paralyzed. She couldn't move, she couldn't touch her husband to wake him up.

134
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:33,370
-Waking up in the fright in the night?
-Yes and also waking up in the morning just being paralyzed. She couldn't move.

135
00:36:35,077 --> 00:36:40,561
-You mean from "mora", what I said that they can not move their limbs?
-Yes.

136
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:54,190
- Phosporus, Lachesis, Sulphur.

137
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:06,291
-In all these cases the crisis is coming and going? They are not constant.

138
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:17,361
-Yes they are not constant situations. They come and go, every 2, 3 days, every day, once, twice the day.

139
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:27,600
They are not regular crisis but when they come they are intolerable.

140
00:37:42,920 --> 00:38:00,701
This is the idea that the fright took place. That fright they have it in the subconscious but not too deep and with the least provocation, with some sleep, it comes up.

141
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:15,280
With some thought that something may happen, it comes up. With too much heat, the crisis comes up. Going into a lift.

142
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:29,770
They are going to the road, they are driving the car, they are in a traffic jam, suddenly they look behind, they get into a panic.

143
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:41,331
-Can they suppress the crisis?
-They cannot, no. You mean suppress it by logic? No.

144
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:56,432
It is too strong, they cannot. They say 'yes I know but when the crisis comes they say, it's impossible to control myself'.

145
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:03,901
-Do you find that the fear of panic is always a fear of death?

146
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:09,361
-Most of them they will describe it as fear of death, most of them.

147
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:32,170
It's not only the fear of death because in some cases you will get the trembling, the fainting, you will get the perspiration. The fear of death starts and goes on in different stages.

148
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:47,061
-In Kent's Repertory there is a rubric which says effects of shock or shock in the mentals. Presumably you would put Aconite into that.

149
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:52,301
-Yes sure.
-What other remedies would you put in?

150
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:57,581
-I would put Opium, Gelsemium, Stramonium.

151
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:12,401
-Arnica?
-When we say shock we don't mean physical.

152
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:22,151
-You talk about mental?
-Yes.
-A crisis.

153
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:44,480
-When I give you this idea it's not that I'm covering the whole, because all remedies can have mentals. There is no remedy that can be left out of this.  I'm giving you the most prominent.

154
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:58,660
-I cannot say for what reason a person has a shock. Because he was too sympathetic to the other? Because he felt suddenly that something of this type may happen to him.

155
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:14,771
Because of different reason? Here the fright is not just a fright. The fright involves most of the time the possibility of death.

156
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:30,741
This is what I found out. I will suffocate now and die, or someone came and put a pistol etc. This idea is behind the Aconite causative factor.

157
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:54,921
In Homeopathy I found out that there is no, always. The word 'always', you can forget it. Most of the times, yes but always?

158
00:42:54,980 --> 00:43:10,750
Because you will get sometimes the Calcarea carbonica who is warm, the Pulsatilla who is cold, the Arsenicum who is also warm, you will getthe Nux vomica warm, the Argentum Nitricum who is cold.

159
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:22,821
You will say but Argentum is suffering from heat, this person is suffering from cold.  How do you get at it? Because the whole picture indicates, it's strong for Argentum nitricum.

160
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:33,000
Therefore you have to ignore the fact that this Argentum nitricum is worse cold.

161
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:12,491
Another thing that you have to remember is that Arsenicum is very cold in his body but hot in his head, ok?

162
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:25,931
Sometimes the heat is there and they say, I'm suffering from heat where the headache is quite warm.

163
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:52,751
I remember in a hospital in Calcutta, where we had weekends sitting there for watch and the nurse came down, I was with another doctor.

164
00:44:53,790 --> 00:45:15,970
The patient had tremendous pains, he was shouting. So rushed upstairs and we found that patient. in India, very warm and that patient was covered with four blankets

165
00:45:16,029 --> 00:45:47,040
She was holding the steels of the bed and she was screaming a word 'jolti' (water). And then she was on her top with a fan and fanning her head.

166
00:45:49,200 --> 00:46:08,750
When we went inside we saw this patient crying for water, and we give water and she was covered in the body where she was trembling like that and the face was absolutely hot.

167
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:31,530
We saw the whole picture of Arsenicum. You give Arsenicum and in 5 minutes the kidney colic was gone. You are not interested whether the colic was in gall bladder or kidneys. The picture is so intense and so clear.

168
00:46:44,890 --> 00:47:21,240
I was asking what is calling? Because I didn't know the words. The impression is to warm the person. When I saw the blankets, 4,5 blankets.

169
00:47:33,701 --> 00:47:48,760
There was a case actually by an American doctor who wrote the case and said, this person was warm and I gave Arsenicum and it acted.

170
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:58,451
And he was very angry by the teachers teaching that Arsenicum is a cold remedy.

171
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:10,101
Anyhow this is not a case where we will say definitely is an Arsenicum case, we still have to see whether it was Arsenicum and secondly

172
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:21,550
whether it was only the head that was warm and not the body but it is a fact that in Homeopathy
 I found there is not "always".
