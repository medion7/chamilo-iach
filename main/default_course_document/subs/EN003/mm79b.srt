1
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,920
Rapidly spread in ulcers but I do not put here

2
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,170
anything about the mental-emotional state of Mercury.

3
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:32,270
So we shall be talking a little bit about the mental-emotional state of Mercury.

4
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:47,590
Mercury is unpredictable. He can go this way or that way, he can go very fast up, 

5
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:57,530
very fast down. You see how unpredictable is when you try to hold the Mercury?

6
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:18,420
It will go, so it can go both extremes. It's really a remedy which has a lot of anger

7
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:27,850
inside and becomes introverted once they are hurt. 

8
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:38,920
Once they are hurt they close inside and they live only with their inner feelings and

9
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:54,840
thoughts. They do not want to share things and that's why they feel threatened by the

10
00:01:54,940 --> 00:02:03,930
environment because the support group, everybody has a support team, the support

11
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:11,420
team around is broken down. So they come to the point where they feel that they are

12
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:19,170
threatened very much by outside people. They are so much threatened that they can

13
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:25,520
reach even a delusion that everybody wants to do harm to them.

14
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:36,600
This is a reason why also they cannot express their emotions and because they can not

15
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,940
express their emotions, they start stammering.

16
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:53,850
And I said stammering with Mercury is a sweet stammering, it's not an aggressive stammering.

17
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:20,170
But the most interesting thing for the mental picture of Mercury is that this aggression that

18
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:28,700
has been kept inside it comes in waves as impulses to do violent things.

19
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:40,670
Suddenly it comes a wave that ... and he described exactly that there comes a wave

20
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:44,680
and I just want to destroy everything.

21
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:53,670
And I want to do some violence and so much strong is this that sometimes they say I

22
00:03:53,770 --> 00:04:06,510
need to go out almost and shout. They try to keep themselves not to shout, not to do

23
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:15,170
violence and there is a constant struggle, violence comes from inside and then the struggle 

24
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,200
not to show it.

25
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:46,510
In this case, apart from the symptoms which Mercury has, he has these core feelings

26
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:51,060
of Mercury, the impulses to do violence but he has to resist.

27
00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:04,680
And maybe one time or another when he feels secure, then if you put here, one more

28
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:11,120
symptom like feels everybody is his enemy, Mercury will shoot up.

29
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,360
Do you want me to show you how in this Repertory, if you put the right symptom, you will

30
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:26,430
get immediately Mercury first. I will tell her to do that to show you that of course

31
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:31,180
repertorisation depends on what you are taking for repertorisation.

32
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:40,530
And then if you take impulses, then again Mercury will be.

33
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,920
-How about the scars, the operation that he had and the pain. 

34
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,960
It doesn't mention anything in Mercury about this.

35
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,710
-No, Mercury does not have that symptom.

36
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,970
-So would you ignore it when you prescribe?

37
00:05:55,070 --> 00:06:02,880
-I would ignore it for the time being and maybe later on if that symptom remains, 

38
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:09,960
maybe a Staphysagria can come as second. You could actually give first Staphysagria and 

39
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:19,630
then Mercury but I see now that the Mercury symptoms are much more strong and over whelm

40
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,730
the idea of Staphysagria.

41
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:34,710
And it has really the history of Mercury symptoms. In the past also he has the Mercury

42
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:42,210
symptoms. So Mercury is running through from a period onwards. So maybe Mercury will

43
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:49,570
bring back all his lost energy and will cure all his physical problems.

44
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:09,300
Mercury you see he has the constipation, the cicatrices, salivation in the night, weakness

45
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:16,220
after stool, cutting pain, change of weather aggravates, desire for sweets, unrefreshing

46
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:22,570
sleep, pain stool, injuries operation. 

47
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,130
-We didn't put any mind symptoms.

48
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:30,150
-OK, just put one mind symptom. I will tell you.

49
00:07:46,400 --> 00:08:01,300
They have programmed my thinking. It's very obvious, if you take the right symptom.

50
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:09,800
Even if not taking the right symptoms, Mercury would come fourth, third, so you could

51
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:15,820
get the idea that somewhere there is Mercury. And then you go back...

52
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:30,210
Then the suppression, the impulses, Mercury feels unprotected, the defense mechanism

53
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:39,460
is weak. That's why the ulcers are spreading. There is an ulcer and the mechanism

54
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:45,300
instead of making the ulcer smaller and smaller, it allows the ulcer to be bigger and 

55
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:51,740
bigger. There is no power behind the defense mechanism. 

56
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:58,910
You see the weakness and the trembling because of the weakness.

57
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:06,650
The trembling and Mercury is one of the main remedies for Parkinson. 

58
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,240
Hands are trembling, legs are trembling.

59
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:29,390
Now he gave me his case the other day, just superficially like that and I was thinking

60
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:35,460
some remedies but never Mercury. I was thinking some remedies but I was not happy.

61
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,740
I said I cannot give the remedy, I will give him the wrong remedy.

62
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:50,480
And really you have to put together the symptoms because there is also the possibility

63
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:59,220
of Alumina, of Silica, of Bryonia, Stramonium, Staphysagria, all these possibilities are

64
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:07,310
there but what is the right remedy that will make the trick. That will free, will take him out

65
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:10,490
of the jail. He is in a jail now.
