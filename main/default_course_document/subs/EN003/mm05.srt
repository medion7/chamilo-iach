1
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:44,040
So here we come to a very interesting remedy: Arsenicum album.

2
00:00:47,960 --> 00:01:23,820
What we see here the combination that gives Arsenicum album is a feeling of insecurity coupled with anxiety about health, fear of death, fear of being alone, restlessness and prostration.

3
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,670
Can you imagine this individual?

4
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:18,779
The idea is that inside him, he feels that he has no support, that he is alone, that he does not have enough security.

5
00:02:18,851 --> 00:02:37,720
Nevermind the security, how much security he may have. He may have a lot of security, a lot of money, a lot of friends, wife, children, whatever, it doesn't matter; still the insecurity is there and wants always somebody next to him.

6
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:59,128
An individual who wants everything to be in order. Every disorder brings a kind of anxiety
 and a kind of insecurity.

7
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:16,140
He wants to know what belongs to him  that is his own.

8
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:39,018
So the fear of death, the restlessness and the anxiety together with the desire for order and cleanliness.

9
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:55,605
He is a person who dresses absolutely meticulously, absolutely well. The best clothes, the best buttons; the buttons are very important.

10
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:12,720
This has to be exactly on the spot. It can take half an hour to bring this exactly into order.

11
00:04:15,275 --> 00:04:32,480
You know the laces if they are not equal, he will not be happy. He will not tie them.

12
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:52,818
I have watched one time one of the doctors of the center. We've been in the sea to swim. Then I said, ok we finished, let's go.

13
00:04:52,890 --> 00:05:05,648
In 3 minutes I dressed and I was waiting for him to finish dressing. He put this, he put that, very slowly.

14
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:16,408
And then he reached the point of the laces. And I was watching and I said, god what is he doing?

15
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:22,018
He was pulling out and then he was pulling a little more and then he was pulling the other way.

16
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:35,648
And I said, 'oh my god come on let's finish. We're half an hour here'. He says, 'I'm coming' until he brought them

17
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:44,170
exactly to the size and then he tied them. I said, now I know your remedy.

18
00:05:52,620 --> 00:06:08,288
A child with fever is concerned with the blankets. Minding the blankets, they are too much down here

19
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:18,088
pulls the blankets so they fall both sides equally.
The child was in fever and the mother says,

20
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:28,400
 she told me to pull the blankets to the exact size. She could not rest. You see the restlessness.

21
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:44,098
Once I had an assistant professor in the University in Athens and he said, 'I would like to know what's Homeopathy'.

22
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:57,195
I said, very good. And I had a doctor with me by this time, she was my student, who was his student as well.

23
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:09,808
So we invited him and he sits in one place with his overcoat; it's winter. He has his overcoat, we talk.

24
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,508
After a while he gets up, he goes and sits in another place.

25
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:19,320
After a while he sits in another place. In the meantime we speak.

26
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:38,110
For 1 hour and a half I explained to him what is Homeopathy. He said in the end, ok this is all theoretical.

27
00:07:38,182 --> 00:07:51,510
 \I have a cold, can you give me something for my cold to go away?'. I said, now it's a good time.

28
00:07:51,720 --> 00:08:00,048
 I did not ask any question. I only saw that his nose was a little bit red.

29
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:18,998
Without asking any question I said to my student, bring Arsenicum 200. So she brings Arsenicum, gives to him and he leaves.

30
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:31,600
Before he says good bye I said, wait a moment. Because the cold was going down and his throat was painful.

31
00:08:31,672 --> 00:08:34,998
He said usually my colds are going down.

32
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:42,658
Tomorrow my cold will be there and I' start coughing and for 15 days I will be coughing.

33
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:52,898
I said, ok take this and what is going to happen by tomorrow evening, your nose will be running.

34
00:08:52,970 --> 00:09:03,340
And by the next day, you will be all right. He left.

35
00:09:03,412 --> 00:09:11,960
Next day in the evening, he picks up the telephone and says, 'my nose is running'. Close the telephone.

36
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:23,090
I heard his voice, he didn't even say his name. 'George, my nose is running'.

37
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:41,068
He is a strange character. You just met somebody. I'm talking about 1967 in Greece.

38
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:53,588
The other day he says, 'you told me that by today I will be alright'. A small pause.

39
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,170
'I'm ok'. Closed the telephone.

40
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:14,648
About 20 days later, because I knew what I had done. I had given him actually his constitutional remedy

41
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:23,720
by observing this, the feeling of the coldness which he had, the restlessness.

42
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:37,558
20 days later he picks up the telephone, he says, 'you know something I have been suffering for the last 15-20 years with gastritis.

43
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:49,168
So I have to have Maalox, it's an antacid drug to counteract the acidity of the stomach. I have Maalox everywhere

44
00:10:49,240 --> 00:11:00,368
in my pockets, in my drawers, in my car, in my house, in my office. I had to take all the time this, my stomach was burning.

45
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:10,000
Now since you gave me the remedy, I do not have that burning. Has anything to do with the remedy?', 'yes'.

46
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:23,638
You know 1967 in Greece, a professor of the University talking with a "charlatan" you know, telling him some

47
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:34,738
strange things he never heard before and now not only the cold went but now the gastritis is cured. Now what is this?

48
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:52,360
Well about a few months later, he says 'can you teach me?', I said yes, 'but nobody will ever know that I'm coming for lessons'.

49
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:03,290
This man became the first President of the Hellenic Homeopathic Medical Association.

50
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:24,208
What is this knowledge? Only believing that a person who is restless, who is cold, who has anxiety;

51
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:31,688
of course he did not express his anxiety but he knew himself how much anxiety, how much fear of death he had.

52
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:44,348
Later on he confessed. What made me give me Arsenicum? It was of course the acid discharge from the nose.

53
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:50,330
There is acid discharge which makes the nose red.

54
00:12:53,250 --> 00:13:05,448
Fastidious, critical about others and about himself. This is a characteristic, very critical.

55
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:33,950
They don't leave anything in chance, they
 will criticize everybody and everything.

56
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,888
Of course it has burning pains.

57
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:47,260
 Ameliorated by heat, hot drinks, hot applications.

58
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:57,890
So this remedy is a very cold remedy which
 is ameliorated by heat in every form.

59
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:09,938
Feels the cold very much and wants to be covered with many blankets except for the head which he wants exposed to fresh air.

60
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:23,398
This is another characteristic while in most acute cases, you will find Arsenicum freezing but the head is hot

61
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:28,220
and wants fresh air. Wants to be fanned.

62
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:46,418
Restless in bed, anxious in bed and fanning the head while he has five blankets. I remember one case in India

63
00:14:46,490 --> 00:15:00,048
 in the hospital, with kidney colic, lying in bed and being very restless. We went up to see the patient

64
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:11,008
very restless, the nurse was there and says, air, air, air in the head. He was covered in India with the heat

65
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:22,898
with 4 blankets, they put one after another. She could not get warm enough. And the head had to be fanned.

66
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:40,648
And he called for water, the nurse was fanning and giving him sips of water.

67
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:58,688
Arsenicum wants water, he feels thirsty but cannot drink a whole bottle. He wants this and again and again

68
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,278
the more the fever, the more frequent.

69
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:20,918
In chronic cases, he has a water cup and he can drink it in one hour, two hours, just sip by sip.

70
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:52,918
Actually if you remember this picture for Arsenicum is enough. The prostration, the restlessness, the coldness,

71
00:16:52,990 --> 00:17:08,048
 the heat of the face, the anxiety and in acute cases you will also see the prostration quite strong.

72
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:17,288
They get up though they are prostrated, they get up from bed because they cannot sit in one place

73
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:23,608
and they go and lie down in the sofa. And they get from the sofa and go and lie down to the chair.

74
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:28,188
They get up from the chair and they lie down to the bed.

75
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:42,440
All this time this restlessness and prostration and the fever and the coldness and the air and then the water in sips.

76
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:20,248
In diarrhea after food poisoning with coldness and prostration, it's almost a specific. Together with specific kind of thirst.

77
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:46,040
Prostration, weakness, tiredness. Prostration is stronger than tiredness, am I correct Mr. English?

78
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,900
Total exhaustion.

79
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:04,398
And asthmatic breathing which is worse lying down. With the head low, Arsenicum forget it.

80
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:10,200
They say, we have to prop up, they stay in a place like this.

81
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:26,738
And the time for aggravation starts after midnight and then it goes more and more, 1 o'clock is very aggravated

82
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:35,968
2 o'clock more aggravation and then slowly subsides and they go back to amelioration.

83
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:49,848
 So from midnight to 12 o'clock usually is their worse time. For asthma, for colics, for pains, whatever and in general.

84
00:19:51,360 --> 00:20:05,578
So the idea is you may have with Arsenicum a lot of symptoms. If you have within 30,40,50 symptoms

85
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:12,370
these symptoms that's a case of Arsenicum.

86
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:24,928
Hypochondriac is anxiety about health. It can reach the point where he is hypochondriac.

87
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:34,128
 Yes the anxiety is quite strong but usually is an anxiety because he is going to die. Fear of death.

88
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:52,688
It's connected with fear of death. Here we have fear of cancer, in Agaricus, but we don't have fear of death.

89
00:20:52,760 --> 00:21:01,088
They will say, I'm not afraid to die; I'm scared to death to get cancer not because I will die.

90
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:16,918
Because of the idea of ugliness, the cancer reminds you of death all the time; death is on me and I'm going to go in a grave.

91
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:22,808
This kind of mentality is Agaricus.
 Here, we have a different mentality all together.

92
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:41,948
 Order. This is mine. The possessiveness is strong with Arsenicum. They like what they possess.

93
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:51,378
They like to have it. They like to keep it. And that is why when they come to the state of anxiety and neurosis

94
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:58,838
they usually cannot go outside in the market, without having somebody next to them.

95
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:07,098
To accompany them, to feel secure that if something happens to them, this person whom they trust

96
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:11,768
they don't take anybody, they take those people who they trust.

97
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:20,420
This person will take me to the hospital, so I can be saved. I will not die.

98
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:41,738
It's very strange how the chemistry on the brain can produce some thoughts. You give Arsenicum and the fear of death is gone.

99
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:50,358
They don't think about it anymore. How is that the chemistry can produce a thought like this?

100
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:58,088
 How is that the chemistry of the brain
changes and produces fear of heart disease?

101
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:04,168
In Lachesis we shall see heart disease. In Aurum we will see heart disease.

102
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:29,958
'I have learned from other teachers that Arsenicum has a strong fear of cancer. In the Repertory also I see that

103
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:39,320
Arsenicum is indicated one of the two remedies which have in the 3rd degree'.

104
00:23:39,392 --> 00:23:43,988
This comes from a misunderstanding of my teaching.

105
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:52,628
Most probably it's somebody who listened to me teaching and then he brought his own idea.

106
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:07,058
What happened? In the way I said, anxiety, anxiety about health, it means fear of cancer etc. I could have said that.

107
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:18,018
But this is not<i> the</i> symptom. Now if somebody hears it and takes it as the symptom, is not my problem.

108
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:25,248
That's why such mistakes have gone through because this must be an addition.

109
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:31,040
If you look through, you will see it's an addition. From who?

110
00:24:54,270 --> 00:25:06,638
Fear of cancer it has to be 3 times there, it has to be Agaricus. It's 1 there.

111
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:18,448
What they did? Somebody listened to my tapes or teaching, heard this fear and put it 3 times.

112
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:28,688
Great anxiety about health. I have raised Arsenicum to the 3rd degree in the anxiety about health.

113
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:39,310
Because originally it was on the 2d degree in Kent's Repertory.

114
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:57,288
The original Kent's Repertory, see anxiety about health. Arsenicum is 1st or 2d degree?

115
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,160
It's 1st.

116
00:26:02,532 --> 00:26:12,888
This is what I say, in my experience the anxiety about health of Arsenicum is very strong

117
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:18,958
and it should be raised to the 3rd degree.
Not the fear of cancer specifically.

118
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:26,168
Anxiety about health. They feel anxious that something will happen to their health whether it will be

119
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:33,430
heart attack, whether it will be brain stroke, whether it will be cancer.

120
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:48,280
But the fear of cancer is not specifically fear of cancer. It is anxiety about health.

121
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:55,798
-What do you recommend for fear of cancer?
-What I recommend?

122
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:59,048
-First or second degree?

123
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:10,140
-If this has fear of cancer, Agaricus on the 3rd degree, this should go on the 2d, Arsenicum.

124
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:22,168
But if you have the Repertory and you can correct, you raise Agaricus to the 3rd degree.

125
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:29,200
Fear of cancer also is Calcarea carbonica, it has to be on the 2d degree.

126
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:40,408
Usually the Arsenicum album is very cold and does not tolerate cold water.

127
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:59,328
But for instance a German Arsenicum, may discipline himself into going into cold water in spite of the fact he does not like it.

128
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:08,090
As a result of going into cold water, he may eventually become accustomed to that.

129
00:28:08,647 --> 00:28:29,608
You can change all these symptoms. For instance a Nat-m who has desire for salt, may have no desire for salt

130
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:40,808
by using the mind saying it's not good for you to have salt. Eventually he feels no desire for salt.

131
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:53,778
In the same way, Lycopodium may not have desire for sweets, or Arg-n desires sweets.

132
00:28:53,850 --> 00:29:06,568
But if he hears sweets are not good, make you ill then they persuade themselves they are not good.

133
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:16,688
In this way yes, you can have the Arsenicum dipping into 15 degrees of Celsius.

134
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:34,178
I, myself used to be cold person. Now I'm not so cold. I carry on swimming in the winter here. And I was blue.

135
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:46,690
I was coming out after 1 minute in the sea and I was blue. But I still say it's good for you, do it. It doesn't matter.

136
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:15,058
So the next remedy that you are learning is Aurum metallicum. Severe depression, relieved only by thoughts of suicide.

137
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:24,360
Constantly dwelling on suicide. That's it. You don't have to remember anything else.

138
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:39,488
Hopeless, despondent. Profound melancholy with a history of attempted suicide, loathing of life.

139
00:30:51,280 --> 00:31:01,720
Here what we have to remember in Aurum is profound despondency.

140
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:23,658
 Anxiety of conscience as if they are guilty of some crime.

141
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:37,608
How would you feel if you had committed a murder and you have kept it inside? The sub-conscious will be

142
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:49,310
always in an upheaval with feelings of guilt. You will never be happy, you will be despondent.

143
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:59,488
Melancholy, depressed.

144
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:15,568
Aurum has this particular symptom of wanting to commit suicide by jumping from a high place.

145
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:23,744
You will ask, 'how are you thinking of committing suicide?' He will say, 'by jumping'.

146
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:31,728
They will not give you the information immediately. You have to understand he's Aurum and you have to ask him

147
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:46,008
how many times you think of suicide everyday? 20, 30, 50 times is the answer. How? By what means? By jumping.

148
00:32:48,620 --> 00:33:04,208
I remember the case of a patient who managed to survive a suicide. She said, 'I was in the terrace of a house'.

149
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:14,658
 Here in Greece we have these terraces on the roof, straight, with little protection.

150
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:30,328
She said, 'I found myself in that position and I was telling myself, now is your time, jump, jump and I said that

151
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:41,910
 if I would jump, I would be relieved from all this tremendous sadness and depression that I was carrying myself'.

152
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:59,190
So these beautiful descriptions are very valid because they point out exactly how an Aurum feels, at the moment before jumping.

153
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:21,288
Aurum the gold. How many people jumped, committed suicide in the financial depression in 1929

154
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:29,923
how many people jumped from the balcony because they lost their gold?

155
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:43,760
They lost the gold and down ! The gold goes up and down. The more up, the more down.

156
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:51,788
 This is the idea with the gold. People like to be the first.

157
00:34:51,860 --> 00:35:01,808
 Like to be in a high position. They enjoy being in a high position, why?

158
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:14,998
Because actually they do not have feelings. The feelings are hardened and being in a high position and getting

159
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:27,178
 the admiration of people from lower down, it makes them feel good.

160
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:39,168
The moment they lose that high position, they lose everything. They want to finish their life.

161
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:49,088
You see a very successful financial man. He thinks he lost not all his money but a lot of his money

162
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:59,368
and the first thing they think is, nobody loves me, I have no friends, my wife does not love me, my children have left me,

163
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:12,088
 I don't have connection with anybody, I don't see anything to look forward. I lost also the position and now I have to jump.

164
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:18,998
   It's the impulse inside, the feeling is from inside.

165
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:28,808
It is different between having courage and between, when they think of doing it they just do it.

166
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:34,488
With Aurum be careful because they are people who really commit suicide.

167
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:44,310
Not that they have courage, it's a different thing. I have courage to stay alive. I don't have courage to jump.

168
00:36:44,715 --> 00:36:48,998
-Normally they are people with courage in other things?

169
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:59,728
-No, not specifically. On the contrary, they lose courage immediately. They lose heart, they lose courage

170
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:10,798
if they lose what they think is their position in life.
They value very much the position. I have to be on the top.

171
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:24,740
The idea is there. Once they are not on the top, then nothing is worth. I better jump and kill myself. This is the idea.

172
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:38,008
 Of course by teaching, by saying things, students listen and then they transfer their understanding of what I have said.

173
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:48,618
So Aurum really jumps, that's what I have said. Not courage, it's madness. The moment they do it

174
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:52,320
they are crazy, they are mad, they are gone.

175
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:22,448
Another point you may see quite frequently is the Aurum, as I said, feel they lost everything. So nothing

176
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:29,158
keeps them in this earth. So it's better they kill themselves.

177
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:51,608
But one thing they feel that may keep them here and it is God. As they are inside them depressed, there is darkness inside

178
00:38:51,680 --> 00:39:00,800
the idea of steel, iron, like you have iron instead of emotions.

179
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:11,888
And they feel they're going down, they're going to jump, there is no hope, there is nothing. And at that moment

180
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:28,948
they start praying. And by praying inside, God help me, God help me, they can pray for 1-2 hours before they can feel

181
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:39,900
a little bit of release from this depression. So praying Aurum, it says in the Repertory 'praying'

182
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:54,040
Like here it says, desires to pray. These are words. What you have to perceive is the state which makes you do this.

183
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:03,456
 That is interesting, that you recognize in a human being and then you can save this person.

184
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:18,848
And neither they will tell you, 'I'm praying'. Very seldom. Praying is natural because human beings

185
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:34,288
we feel helpless many times. We all pray one way or another. But we don't stay for hours, in order to relieve

186
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:38,928
a little bit that tremendous depression to pray and pray and pray.

187
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:53,538
I remember in India, a boy came in the hostel where  I used to stay. He had a severe pain in his testes. Swelled up.

188
00:40:53,610 --> 00:41:01,348
He tried to take different remedies because he was in the School and he has asked different remedies

189
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:12,088
from the other teachers there in the School. Then he came to me, he says 'I cannot live with this pain, it is too much

190
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:24,838
and can you do something?'. Then I enquired and I saw the depression in the boy, not strong. I said to him, do you pray?

191
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:40,938
He says, 'I pray, I get up in the morning'. 'For how long?'. 'Two hours, two and a half hours I pray'. It's very good, Aurum.

192
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:47,500
Pain in 3,4 days was finished. Swelling went down.

193
00:41:53,685 --> 00:42:04,728
-You were talking about students who have problems during their studies. What do you suggest for students

194
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:13,808
before the final examinations, if they have diarrhea and insomnia and all this?

195
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,288
What would be the first remedy to think of?

196
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:30,248
-According to the symptoms. If they are terrified, trembling, I'm going to go to the examinations and they lose courage

197
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:41,280
and they are afraid, fearful, Gelsemium. But if they have diarrhea is different because it can be Arg-n.

198
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:59,880
And if they have total black out of the mind, the mind is so tired that they feel they cannot remember anything it's Picric Acid.

199
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:08,048
-I mean before the examinations. For example one week insomnia.

200
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:20,568
-One week insomnia before the examinations because of excitement, it might be either Nux Vomica or Coffea.

201
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:30,298
Because of excitement, you know they are so excited, reading, studying, the mind goes on continuously to think

202
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:39,318
then we have to think of Coffea or Nux Vomica. You see it depends how you give a question.

203
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:48,898
How you say a symptom and then I will give you the answer. Not me, Homeopathy has these answers.

204
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:13,480
Let's go to the next remedy.

205
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:23,320
 Belladonna.

206
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:40,248
Do you know what the word Belladonna means?

207
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:53,200
Bella in Italian means beautiful, donna, lady. Beautiful lady. Why Belladonna was called a beautiful lady?

208
00:44:53,950 --> 00:45:12,888
Because the ancients they have noticed that if a woman ate the berries of this plant, they used to have bright eyes and rosy cheeks.

209
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:28,048
It makes the face red and the eyes bright, they are shinning. And these are the characteristics of the remedy.

210
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:43,328
Redness of face and eyes, in fever the eyes are shining and red.

211
00:45:44,760 --> 00:46:05,100
Glistening, shining. And the whole body radiates heat in the Belladonna, especially in the Belladonna fever cases.

212
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:17,540
Without that heat of the body, Belladonna will not be indicated.

213
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:25,128
You have to remember a very characteristic of Belladonna:

214
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:39,888
The head is very warm, burning warm, red and the extremities, the hands and especially the feet are cold.

215
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:55,448
This is the great keynote of Belladonna. Hardly any case of Belladonna has warm feet.

216
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:09,238
The feet are cold while at the same time the head is very warm, very red and redness in general.

217
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:22,900
If a skin eruption is very red, the main thing that impresses you in a skin eruption is redness, then most probably is a Belladonna case.

218
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:38,358
Radiating heat at the same time, definitely Belladonna. Warm head, cold feet this is a Belladonna situation.

219
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:49,480
Extremities in general cold, hands and feet.

220
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:06,648
And of course Belladonna is known for having a great intensity of symptoms.

221
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:14,890
Symptoms are coming like a storm and suddenly and they become very prominent.

222
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:33,128
The headache comes within half an hour. They want not to move at all, they want to lie down, they don't want

223
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:41,340
any movement, any light, nothing that will disturb them.

224
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,420
And the headache is usually on the right side.

225
00:48:50,200 --> 00:49:05,208
Then during the Belladonna case, we have a characteristic that if they receive a jar like this, you go to the bed side

226
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:10,380
and you sit to look at the patient.

227
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:30,168
Wherever is the pain, in the abdomen, in the head, the jar makes the pain tremendous. This is very characteristic of Belladonna.

228
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:48,160
They are people with intense emotions and presence. They are strong, vital, self-confident.

229
00:49:54,240 --> 00:50:09,448
These emotions strong all day they continue during the night. So they go to sleep and there you see the activity.

230
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:18,378
 They start talking in their sleep very loudly. You can hear them.

231
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:26,918
Saying different things, conversations and the intensity is there.

232
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:40,378
Also the irritation on the meninges which is expressed with grinding of the teeth.

233
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:51,408
In the night. Which is the other remedy which has strong grinding of teeth?

234
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:13,588
-Tuberculinum. Usually when we see grinding of teeth, we think of Tuberculinum first and then we have to think of Belladonna.

235
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:19,908
There is another remedy of course, Cina, Stramonium also have grinding of the teeth, but that shows the activity

236
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:30,918
the irritation in the brain. Especially with the fever you see they're grinding their teeth, they're talking, the fever is very high

237
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:40,768
the headache is pounding, the redness in the face and the shining of the eyes. That makes the full picture of Belladonna.

238
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:46,350
And if you jerk them, they jump.

239
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:14,140
Of course cold applications ameliorate. I mean if you have somebody who is boiling, you put some cold applications and makes him better.

240
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:44,498
Desire for lemonade is very characteristic, during fever especially, squeezed lemon.

241
00:52:53,930 --> 00:53:16,440
Not "Fanta". Real lemon, we're talking about lemonade. By the time we were doing these provings, we did not have "Fanta".

242
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:25,028
-But what if somebody likes "Fanta"?

243
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:32,348
-Maybe he likes it because of the fizzing.
-Can you use it for Belladonna?

244
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:44,168
-No. The lemon must be the sour because Belladonna likes lemon.

245
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:50,910
It can eat lemon. Arsenicum, Belladonna, Veratrum album they like lemon

246
00:53:50,982 --> 00:54:00,248
and when we say lemonade, we mean natural juice.

247
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:14,140
Of course our taste today is degenerated and we may want "Fanta".

248
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:46,628
So what strikes you here is the irritability with the special, leave-me-alone, attitude.

249
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:58,128
Aggravated by any interference by any person. They lie down and the woman comes, she is concerned, how are you?

250
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:11,758
 They don't answer. You want something? No answer. Why they don't answer? Because they feel so irritable inside

251
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:18,498
and if they talk it's such an effort and the headache will become worse. And everything will become worse,

252
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:34,640
so they just don't answer. If they do answer, it's going to be very rude answer. Leave me alone.

253
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:56,248
Once I examined somebody who is Bryonia and he was lying on the sofa, looking at the wall. And I was behind him

254
00:55:56,320 --> 00:56:06,758
and the examination was all the time like this. Him, looking at the wall, answer me some questions

255
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:15,288
but he would not turn around to look at me. Why? Because it was very painful, he had a pneumonia.

256
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:26,768
And the coughing was so painful, every motion, everything makes it worse. So to turn around and talk to me

257
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:34,048
it was a great effort, he did not turn. So I did all the examination like this

258
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:43,968
and of course I prescribed Bryonia. He doesn't turn because he is painful.

259
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:55,378
You can ask him, you don't turn because it's painful? He may nod, something like that but the aggravation

260
00:56:55,450 --> 00:57:01,528
 therefore from motion, is very characteristic of that remedy

261
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:14,358
Never mind what it is, it is a sciatica, a lumbago, a headache, a pain in the stomach, pain in the abdomen, whatever.

262
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:21,370
Worse from any motion.

263
00:57:21,442 --> 00:57:31,168
 And another characteristic is very thirsty for large quantity, frequently.

264
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:43,488
That means I take this, I drink it. After half an hour, I need another one. After half an hour, I need another one.

265
00:57:43,560 --> 00:58:06,568
Very thirsty. It's one of the most thirsty remedies together with Phosphorus, Sulphur, Natrum muriaticum, very good.

266
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:09,880
For large quantities.

267
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,810
Strong fear of poverty.

268
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:41,148
  You see these people, a constitutional Bryonia has lived as a loner. The "leave me alone attitude".

269
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:53,838
They are much happier if they are left alone. They are not the people who will socialize, who will communicate

270
00:58:53,910 --> 00:58:59,240
they feel better if they are alone.  is me.

271
00:59:01,570 --> 00:59:17,688
 For instance like me. Here you laugh.
 Likes to be alone.

272
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:27,588
It can be, it doesn't matter, they are people
 who are duty bound, they will do their duty.

273
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:44,418
They will come and teach but they prefer to be alone. And they don't depend, they are people who do not like to depend.

274
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:48,480
If they want something, they will do it themselves.

275
00:59:49,760 --> 01:00:05,238
This attitude, when you don't rely on somebody, you get fear of poverty. That means, if I don't have enough money, what shall I do?

276
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:13,008
Because if you don't have friends, if you don't rely on somebody, if you don't have associates and you rely

277
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:23,848
on your own money not in anything else, then you get strong fear of poverty. And Bryonia is one of the remedies

278
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:34,568
with Psorinum, Sulphur and Calcarea carbonica and Calcarea fluorica and different other remedies, that have fear of poverty.

279
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:56,398
And it's very interesting also in their delirium, if they are lying in delirium, they will say, let's go home.

280
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:05,418
I want to go home. They feel better alone in their own house.

281
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:23,618
It's very interesting one case I had in a hospital, in Athens, where I was treating this patient.

282
01:01:23,690 --> 01:01:37,298
He was in a coma for 3 months, he came out of the coma and almost as soon as he came out of the coma

283
01:01:37,370 --> 01:01:46,968
after Opium, Sulphur and Hyoscyamus, I think these 3 remedies brought him out of the coma and the 4th remedy was Bryonia.

284
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:50,348
 He said, take me home; he did not know what he was saying.

285
01:01:53,070 --> 01:02:03,860
He could talk now but still not clear. He said, take me home, take me home, let's go home.

286
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:18,840
But he could not recognize his daughter for instance. He looked and said, 'let's go home, let's go home'. Bryonia.

287
01:02:20,890 --> 01:02:41,680
Coughing so painful that he has to hold his chest. I told you that. This movement of the chest is unbearable.

288
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:52,728
Headache on left side is characteristic and the pain goes to the left occipital protuberance.

289
01:02:55,600 --> 01:03:14,330
Pain over the left eye that extends to the left occipital protuberance, is Bryonia alone. Worse, motion.

290
01:03:55,400 --> 01:04:00,560
It's one of the few remedies that they like to sleep on left side.

291
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:23,210
But if they have gallbladder problems, they like to lie upon the painful part. They like to lie on the right side.

292
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:38,138
So it does not move. In a gallbladder inflammation, lying on the left side makes it worse.

293
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:48,438
They turn on the right side and they feel good. Belladonna, they don't like the pressure so they turn on the left side.

294
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:57,430
So Belladonna in a gallbladder inflammation, will be lying on the opposite side.

295
01:04:57,502 --> 01:05:04,040
Bryonia will lie on the side where there is the inflammation.

296
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:24,988
It's one of the remedies that have severe constipation like,  which is the other remedy that we talked about

297
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:27,498
and it has severe constipation?

298
01:05:27,570 --> 01:05:30,300
-Alumina.

299
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:43,908
-Alumina, severe constipation, it's similar. Bryonia and Alumina are similar in their constipation

300
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:52,848
and they sometimes complement each other in severe constipation.

301
01:05:52,920 --> 01:06:01,358
You start with Bryonia and then you go to Alumina. Or you start with Alumina, it's completed with Bryonia.

302
01:06:01,430 --> 01:06:11,600
Bryonia has dryness, it's a dry remedy, a remedy that needs water. Where is my water?

303
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:23,550
These remedies are dehydrated easily.

304
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:34,560
For whom this temperature is too much?

305
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:44,860
For whom it's pleasant?

306
01:06:48,190 --> 01:06:53,010
For whom it's cold?

307
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:09,808
It's an organism that loses the water easily. The water goes away from the organism easily, that is general.

308
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:16,400
Of course you may get a case where the thirst is normal.

309
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:29,848
-My question was, I know they are always thirsty. Almost always. My question was, if the pain is very strong?

310
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:33,838
-If the pain is very strong?
-They are still drinking or not?

311
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:35,808
-They are drinking yes.

312
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:40,238
-Because I think I read, maybe something from you.

313
01:07:40,310 --> 01:07:52,698
-Not from me.
-They avoid to drink because of the movement by drinking is so hard

314
01:07:52,770 --> 01:07:59,668
in pneumonia or other illness so they avoid drinking.

315
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:03,688
-Not from me.
-Ok, thank you.

316
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:17,338
-You see the thirst for Bryonia is strong, they cannot avoid it. They cannot say, let me not drink or drink later.

317
01:08:17,410 --> 01:08:26,304
It's strong thirst, need for water. They will drink.

318
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:46,208
The idea that they will have aggravation from motion and thirsty. Aggravation from motion and constipated.

319
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:48,960
Do you see the dryness?

320
01:08:49,730 --> 01:09:05,468
Constipation with very hard and dry stool as if burnt. That means there is no mucus in the intestines.

321
01:09:10,270 --> 01:09:17,000
Nausea and faintness from sitting up or rising in bed also is characteristic.

322
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:28,678
Especially in acute conditions, the moment they try to rise from bed they feel dizzy and they feel vomiting. They feel nauseous.

323
01:09:32,990 --> 01:09:41,968
If you have a chronic case, whatever, which has that particular symptom, you have to be thinking of Bryonia.

324
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:15,680
One more remedy and we finish for today. Otherwise you will have nightmares. You will see remedies in your sleep.
