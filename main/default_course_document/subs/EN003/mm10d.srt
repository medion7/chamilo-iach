1
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:44,056
The remedies are like every living being.

2
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,076
Starts with an ovum and a fertilization.

3
00:00:52,570 --> 00:01:01,056
A little bit of information, everything seems the same. Eventually develops more and more.

4
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:11,066
Then we have a certain period when we have information on symptomatology. We just have some symptoms.

5
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:27,576
Then these symptoms as we get experienced more and more, these flat symptoms develop into a living pathological entity.

6
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:35,450
And this is the final stage in the development of a remedy.

7
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:52,491
So Phos. is one of those remedies which we know quite a lot about and we have almost the final picture of its pathology.

8
00:01:53,050 --> 00:02:00,086
And what is this final picture of the pathology of Phos.?

9
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:17,750
They are individuals who have opened up, they have been opened.

10
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:36,056
And if you open a box with different things, they are just spilled out all the things inside the box.

11
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:51,326
The Phos. is the individual who has no box, no protection, no skin to retain within the skin everything else.

12
00:02:51,390 --> 00:03:04,576
The soul is coming out, the blood is oozing out. The soul is out.

13
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:10,980
And the mind also is out.

14
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:32,480
So what is this openess? They are open to receive impressions without the ability to resist.

15
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:46,450
If I...shout!

16
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:01,026
Each one received this shock in a different manner.

17
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:15,400
Some they did not even move. Some they moved a little bit. Some they did like this and some, 'ah! what it was that?'

18
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:33,456
Those who are Phos. indeed, the mind is out, is there. We've been talking on the first about the mental emotional body.

19
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:43,216
In the Phos. cases it comes out. It's like hovering outside of the body.

20
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:59,160
And when there is a shock outside, it comes back. That is what it says, startling easily.

21
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:13,840
 It is this idea with Phos. which the mind is diffused outside. The feelings are diffused.

22
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:29,456
If the feelings come out and somebody is suffering, immediately they pick up the suffering from the person who suffers.

23
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:40,376
And they suffer themselves. It says sympathetic but actually what kind of sympathetic?

24
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:51,976
That person who has this tendency to come out and see 'what happens? Oh you suffer!'.

25
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,576
They do not have a resistance. Suffering goes right through to them.

26
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:09,046
They see suffering and they move it inside and they, themselves are suffering.

27
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:25,476
The same thing with thunderstorms. 'Fear of thunderstorms'. Phos. is like this, 'what's going to happen?'.

28
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:33,016
 Eventually it says, 'something is going to happen'.

29
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:43,516
'Something bad is going to happen' and then it becomes strong anxiety; fear that something will happen.

30
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:54,036
Something will happen which has to do with what? It has to do with suffering either of himself or of others.

31
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:08,866
It's not fear that something will happen like an earthquake, like planetary catastrophe. These are other remedies which have this.

32
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:24,866
The anxiety and the fear of Phos. comes when they come into contact with suffering. They cannot tolerate suffering.

33
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:50,816
This is the main characteristic on the mental emotional level of Phos.

34
00:07:50,880 --> 00:08:03,176
So Phos. are people who perceive easily the feelings of the others; because they are open.

35
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:11,096
They have no protection. Whatever you feel, they feel. Whatever you think sometimes, they think.

36
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:17,576
Sometimes they perceive the thoughts of others because they are so open.

37
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:32,136
 And you say, this is a nice quality. It's not because this creates a suffering within the individual

38
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:44,136
which is sometimes unbearable. They cannot tolerate such strong suffering.

39
00:08:51,390 --> 00:09:06,330
And of course they are good listeners because they will say 'what did you say, this happens to you? Tell me!'

40
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:26,636
They come to you as a doctor, he is the patient. He sees that today you don't feel well. He says 'do you have any problem?'

41
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:37,006
'Yes'. 'What it is?'. And then he starts examining the doctor. What's the problem with the doctor

42
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:41,976
 he has to do something with this person who is suffering in front of him.

43
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:52,536
This is a little bit of exaggeration but this is the type that you will meet. A typical Phos. case.

44
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:18,286
They like to have somebody to talk to. These communicative people they have to have somebody.

45
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:42,096
 It says 'desires company' in capital letters.The idea is that Phos. actually needs somebody to reassure him

46
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:52,546
that nothing bad is going to happen. What they do? They communicate, they talk with the idea that

47
00:10:52,610 --> 00:11:06,760
 their mind is taken away from their anxiety. The anxiety, the free floating anxiety is mostly about their own health

48
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:18,837
 which is primary problem, and the anxiety about their loved ones. Their children, their wives, their husbands, mother, father.

49
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:33,896
If you get a Phos. case and the mother is sick, 'my God you have high blood pressure' and then the mother comes and says...

50
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:51,696
'what's happening? Stop, sit down', they will take care of the mother, they have to do something, why?

51
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,080
 Because they themselves are suffering.

52
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:13,056
In the hospital you will see a case where they will say, please take me away from this room because this woman is suffering a lot.

53
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:27,626
Forget it, the Phos. cannot stay in that room. It's not possible but somebody else says OK.

54
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:39,316
So that is the structure of Phos., the sensitivities of the Phos. people.

55
00:12:46,880 --> 00:13:00,996
They have anxiety about their health; the anxiety can be very hypochondriacal. With a little thing, this is cancer now.

56
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:15,056
This maybe cancer and then it is the type of the patient who will go to the doctor and he will be influenced by the doctor.

57
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:21,836
The doctor will say, no this is nothing, don't worry, you don't have cancer.

58
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:31,906
They calm down, they go away. Next day, two days later again they start but for a period of time

59
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:39,136
 they are better with the evaluation of the doctor who says 'there is no problem with you'.

60
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:46,456
It is not the same with other remedies so you have to start according to the information you have already.

61
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:57,440
You have to compare this kind of anxiety with the anxiety of ....

62
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:09,003
Agar., Ars., Kali-ars. But you see the difference there.

63
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:19,266
You see the Ars. will be very critical to what you say. They don't believe you.

64
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:29,076
An Ars. comes there with an anxiety about their health, with fear of cancer, with fear of something is wrong with them

65
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:38,376
and you say to them, 'no problem, nothing'. They will not believe you. They will go and check it out, take examinations

66
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:48,096
go to another two doctors to see whether they have the same opinion. It is different.

67
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:58,840
The reaction is different, the presence of the people in front of you are different.

68
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:10,416
You see the openess. It's very nice to have Phos. because they are concerned about you.

69
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:17,116
Sometimes you give the wrong remedy, you don't recognize a Phos. case, you give Nit-ac.

70
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:27,236
They come and they want to say that they are better. They want to please because they will cause pain to you

71
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:38,906
 if they say, 'I'm the same'. The Ars. or the Nit-ac. they are better. They will come there and say, 'I think I am the same'.

72
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:50,896
And unless you understand then you will be misguided to believe that they are the same or they are not the same.

73
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:58,746
On the contrary, the Phos. will say, I'm better. And you examine symptom by symptom and you don't see

74
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:08,120
much difference you say this is not better really. This is most probably a case of Phos.

75
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:30,936
The peculiar thing you have on the physical level, what you will need except of this oozing out, diffusion

76
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:45,136
bleeding easily, the blood is spilled out very naturally. The nose opens just for no reason. It runs blood.

77
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:52,760
The woman has metrorrhagias, the blood goes out.

78
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:04,916
Usually the days of the menses for a Phos. case are more than 5 and full of blood.

79
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:16,226
You know the blood starts a little, then it goes to a peak and then it goes down. With the Phos. is a lot of blood.

80
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:27,280
Every time they lose a lot of blood. They have a polypus, the polypus will bleed very easily.

81
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:37,696
 So this bleeding on the physical level that we see, usually in the children. In the history of the children you ask

82
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:47,286
 'this boy was bleeding in his first years?', 'Yes he was bleeding very much, we had to cauterize

83
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:53,840
the arteries and stop the bleeding by force.

84
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:02,896
Another characteristic that if you see then you think of Phos. is, except of the bleeding is

85
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:17,136
great thirst for cold water, big thirst. they drink a lot and the water has to be very cold. Why is this?

86
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,536
 From physiology point of view? You have somebody who is bleeding from his stomach.

87
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:32,636
He has history of duodenal ulcer with a lot of bleedings, you think of Phos.

88
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:48,130
In order to stop the bleeding what do you order your patient to do? Cold drinks. Why?

89
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:55,726
Because it has to contract the arteries so the bleeding will be reduced.

90
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:07,296
Phos. by nature feels that he needs this coldness to sustain itself.

91
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:22,966
Another characteristic of Phos., we said the bleeding, we said the openness in the character, the desire for communication.

92
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:38,110
We said the sympathetic element, very much affected, then what else you need?

93
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:51,936
The fear on electrical changes of the atmosphere and the fear of thunderstorms. Extreme fear of thunderstorms,

94
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:07,146
 grown ups they will go under the table. They will not be able to use their logical mind. The fear is overwhelming.

95
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:18,296
Also the Phos. cases have a specific sensitivity towards the change of the atmosphere.

96
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:24,816
Atmospheric changes when they are felt very much, they suffer a lot.

97
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:35,306
They call it the electrical changes in the atmosphere. That shows again the openess to the environment.

98
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:43,630
They are open to the influences of the environment.

99
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:56,726
Phos. has a similar symptom with Natrum Muriaticum. What it is?

100
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:11,166
Salt. They have a strong desire for salt. Fish also, correct.

101
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:27,216
Desire salt is one of the primary symptom, great thirst for cold water together with desire for salt makes for two remedies.

102
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,696
Nat-m and Phos. What is the difference?

103
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:42,272
The one is closed. Nothing affects Nat-m or at least they will not show it.

104
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:48,030
Phos. will be affected by everything on the environment and they will show it.

105
00:21:48,094 --> 00:21:54,816
So it's not possible to confuse the one for the other.

106
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:03,286
Desire for fish also. Both these remedies have excessive desire for fish.

107
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:20,136
They have all these fears, these anxieties and what they want? They want to communicate, to go to a friend

108
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:29,416
 and say in the telephone 'I have this and I have that' to talk about it. And they like to talk about their symptoms

109
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:40,896
 they like therefore communication. And in this way they learn that they can communicate very easily.

110
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:47,230
As a result of this, Phos. cases communicate very easily, communicate with the opposite sex.

111
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:59,626
They have easily communication with the opposite sex. Where the Nat-m is very difficult to make a new approach.

112
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:09,484
 For Phos., very easy. One girl left the Phos., next day Phos. has found another one. It's like this.

113
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:22,536
The Nat-m has a kind of love disappointment. It will take one year before it's over, two years.

114
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:30,536
For the Phos. a few days, a few weeks, it depends. Why? Because of this easy communication.

115
00:23:46,860 --> 00:24:02,280
Another characteristic is the time of aggravation. It's the time that the sun goes down. Twilight.

116
00:24:02,344 --> 00:24:09,856
And their great amelioration is after sleep.

117
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:18,516
Sleep makes them feel very good. It is like a medicine. It says, my medicine is to sleep.

118
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:31,616
Everything that they have after sleep it's gone and then of course as the day goes by, they have more and more problems.

119
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:42,240
And then in the twilight the anxiety rises and until they go to bed, they go to bed and sleep in 5 minutes.

120
00:24:42,304 --> 00:24:51,816
And they go through the whole night sleeping very nicely, very peacefully and in the morning they wake up very refreshed.

121
00:24:51,880 --> 00:25:04,410
This is one type of Phos. as we describe. But there is another type, the polarity. Another type of Phos.

122
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:15,056
which this sensitivity we have been talking about, sensitivity with the impressions, is so great

123
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:23,696
that eventually the Phos. may stay inside the house without being able to communicate with anybody

124
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:35,600
because they feel pain by communicating, by going out. It's a very severe state of border line insanity

125
00:25:35,664 --> 00:25:44,446
where people will stay inside, without being able to communicate with anybody because they claim that 'if I go outside

126
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:50,936
to the supermarket to buy something, I see people suffering and I cannot stand it. If they talk to me,

127
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,480
I see they are suffering and I cannot stand it, so I stay in the house'.

128
00:25:55,090 --> 00:26:06,816
So we have the opposite polarity where Phos. does not like company.

129
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:24,366
And also they will wake up in the morning unrefreshed.

130
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:40,536
In Phos. when the subconscious is not expressed, all these fears and they stay inside, they create a very

131
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:47,176
disturbed soul which wakes up in the morning very unrefreshed.

132
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:58,332
They see a lot of dreams, suffering through the subconscious, they wake up in the morning, they are terrible.

133
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:07,516
So you will find in the Repertory, 'sleep ameliorates': Phos. capital.

134
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:14,496
'Sleep aggravates', 'unrefreshed sleep': Phos. capital.

135
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:32,976
So it depends which type you are examining. And then you go to the main points and you ask about.

136
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:50,296
The suffering can be so much from the others that they cannot establish a relationship.

137
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:04,376
Of course the one type, the first type I'm talking about, sexually will feel what?

138
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:23,496
Very active, sexually active and easily aroused, easily performing but the other type, the closed type

139
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:30,400
is very difficult, almost impossible to have a contact.

140
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:57,986
I had one case, that she would be afraid so much - a woman of 35 - she could not have any sexual contact.

141
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:08,536
With the idea that she was afraid of the pain that she may experience by having sexual intercourse.

142
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:17,166
The same symptom, that symptom we have seen it also in another remedy we have talked about. Arnica, very good.

143
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:26,656
So in the study cases when we give you the symptoms, you just try to find which is...

144
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:35,556
You see the idea with Homeopathy always is to construct, out of the information, to construct this picture.

145
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:47,390
What picture are you constructing from this information? I construct a picture of Phos. or it doesn't look like Phos.
