1
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:34,209
You will be happy that we have this remedy because at one stage or another almost everyone

2
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:48,629
will need Ign. to bring back the
grief of a disappointed love affair.

3
00:00:49,890 --> 00:01:07,659
Ign's are sensitive people therefore. People who will fall in love once and this time is going to be very strong.

4
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:20,059
And if they get a disappointment they can
go into states which usually require Ign.

5
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:37,190
The most apparent symptom when it comes to that state is .... like this.

6
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:53,569
They try to get a deep breath and it's not possible. They feel the air does not satisfy their lungs.

7
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:18,279
Why they do this? Because their sensitivity does not allow them to speak out their great grief.

8
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:33,549
So they keep the grief inside very silently. Suffering inside but they will not say one word to anybody.

9
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:46,279
The only thing you can see is that the mind is always somewhere else; they are not present and from time

10
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,059
 to time, they go like this.

11
00:02:53,280 --> 00:03:09,029
If you see somebody in your family, especially the younger, between 20-50, they all get it.

12
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:36,199
Under 20, they go over, it's OK. But once they reach 20 and they decide this is good relation and let us say

13
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:43,249
one Ign. has a relation with a Phos.

14
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:53,599
The Ign. is going to have a problem with the Phos. case because Phos. is very communicative

15
00:03:53,600 --> 00:04:00,760
 he is very open. He can express his emotions.

16
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:18,639
The Ign. will stay, will watch, will admire but one time he will see that Phos.  is actually flirting with somebody

17
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:26,129
and she will not say anything. She will keep
 a bit silent. We say silent grief.

18
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:31,609
You see silent grief how strong it is with Ign.?

19
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:39,890
The Ign. will watch. 'My God! He is flirting!'

20
00:04:39,891 --> 00:04:48,119
 But this 'flirting!' is inside, outside it's
 integrity. It's not to say anything.

21
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:58,919
Maybe I made a mistake. We'll see next time. Again, second time. Then the third time....

22
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:10,689
This is within a period of 6 months, 9 months, the relationship is going very well because Ign. in the beginning

23
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:21,699
 if she has not been in a real Ign. state, they
 are sensitive people who express...

24
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:27,519
Now I tell you something so you
get some experience from life.

25
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:41,219
The more close a person is, the more
their emotions during an intimate relation.

26
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:55,279
A person who cannot express her/his emotionality in every day socializations keeps this emotionality

27
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,999
only for that particular person.

28
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:10,279
So all the emotions are concentrated and are expressed in that particular relation, in a very private manner

29
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,055
 in a very intimate way.

30
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:24,289
Once Ign. decides that this is the relationship, this is what I like, she opens up, then the emotions

31
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:28,769
are very strong. The same with Nat-m.

32
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:36,159
Both Ign. and Nat-m. are very alive emotionally people.

33
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:45,679
Therefore the emotions they have great force and are directed towards one person. They concentrate on one person.

34
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:54,243
They don't care about anything else. They don't care to say, to express their emotions to somebody else.

35
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:04,559
They are interested very much to get the emotional expression when they are together.

36
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:14,799
So that is very powerful and when the disappointment comes, the disappointment is really a shock.

37
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:25,069
It shakes the organism and it can reach the organism, reduce the organism to nothing.

38
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:41,069
And you see it collapses. Emotional, not mental collapse and suffering and physical collapse.

39
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:56,409
In noon time, they come back from work and they lie down and they cannot talk, they cannot express anything.

40
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:07,819
They close themselves into the room and there from time to time seldom, they will go into spasmodic crying.

41
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,479
Putting the pillow, so they don't hear in the next room.

42
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:36,879
And then they cry, they go out, now it's the dinner. They go to the table, they sit, the mother, the father

43
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,487
whoever is in the room don't understand anything.

44
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:50,790
What has been half an hour ago, has been
a torture inside, by herself. This is the idea.

45
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:55,863
 Nobody must see what I'm going through.

46
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:06,079
It is absolutely necessary. It's a silent grief. Everything is kept inside.

47
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:12,850
Only you can see the sighing.

48
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:25,159
So for us that we know, something is wrong.

49
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,200
And then you can be a prophet.

50
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:45,379
Because you see the lack of concentration. You talk to them and they are not present, they are not there.

51
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:54,040
They're thinking all the time; behind their mind is what happened to me.

52
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,280
He left me.

53
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:13,239
Actually he did not leave her but the sensitivity and the idea that immediately she perceives.

54
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:24,000
The book says, Ign. quick to perceive and quick in execution. They are very aware people.

55
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:34,919
So their awareness tells them very quickly, he is flirting. 1,2,3,5 times then everything is blocked inside

56
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:48,919
and then the vagus nerve, which is responsible for the normal function of the lungs, is cramped.

57
00:10:48,920 --> 00:11:03,159
Why? Ign. has a specific action upon the vagus nerve, the nerve which is responsible for the breathing. It cramps it.

58
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:23,769
They say when they describe, I feel as if my chest is so heavy; I cannot lift it to breathe.

59
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:37,839
Did you have a grief? Did something happened to you? They will think before answering you.

60
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:49,669
They will think, is it necessary for me to tell all that experience again? And then they will say something.

61
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:53,471
And then you insist because you know exactly what is the situation and you insist.

62
00:11:53,571 --> 00:12:01,359
The moment you insist more and more,
you see the crying comes to the eyes.

63
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:15,369
At the same time that tears come, there is the will to discipline themselves and not to show. They have to suffer by themselves.

64
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:23,049
This is my affair, it is something that
concerns only me and nobody else.

65
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:27,209
Why should I tell anybody else what I'm going through.

66
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:33,680
This is what is going on in the mind of an Ign. case.

67
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:44,639
Now this can be primarily because of a romantic disappointment.

68
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:57,119
The pathology develops because of that. But also the pathology can develop because you lost your mother, your father.

69
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:06,979
Because many times the relationship between our mother and father is romantic.

70
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:14,815
When a woman admires the father very much and she loses him, she can go to Ign. state.

71
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:29,272
Because it was almost an erotic relationship. The same with the boy who loses his mother. It was a kind of erotic relationship.

72
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,859
These cases will go into Ign. states.

73
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:42,709
-How is about children when the parents move to another place and they lose their environment?

74
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:56,219
-The same. Children they will say nothing but they will feel, I'm losing my mother....

75
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:17,719
And then Ign. will develop problems with the nervous system. That means convulsions, chorea.

76
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:37,219
-My question was if children are moved to another place? The parents decided to move from Germany

77
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:43,699
 to Greece and they lose their
environment, friends or the house?

78
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:57,639
-Less. Mostly you will see it in little children 5,6 when they lost their parents because of divorce.

79
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:07,119
They have divorced and the child at this age doesn't know, where is my mother, where is my father?

80
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:17,619
But not for friends, at least I've not seen it.

81
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:27,359
But going away from one place to another, it can cause some grief to children, there is no question.

82
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:34,389
This grief can be counteracted by the organism.

83
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:47,279
The child is sad on a few weeks and it's over, they forget but the divorce they don't forget.

84
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:56,415
Because it is something more steady. Not all
the children of divorce will go into Ign. state.

85
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:09,809
But it can be and it can be quite severe. When I say Ign. states, I don't mean just feeling heavy.

86
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:23,799
I mean ulcers, colitis, heart problems, liver problems, neuro muscular problems can develop after grief.

87
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:43,279
Grief is something which gives to the system such a shock that the predispositions of this organism can flare.

88
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:52,279
Suddenly they just come out. And with predisposition for diabetes, diabetes.

89
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:05,869
Juvenile diabetes in children, that means they are going to get it. Some children they get it at the age of 7

90
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:09,619
some they get it at the age of 15 or 16.

91
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:15,239
And you get it at the age of 15,16 under stress.

92
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:23,319
That means if the child did not have stress, it could have gone over in a nice, protected environment.

93
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:27,839
It could have gone over without ever appearing the diabetes.

94
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:54,849
We'll speak tomorrow about the conditions under which symptomatology appears in an organism.

95
00:17:54,850 --> 00:18:04,079
Which are the main causes for the manifestation of diseases? Exciting cause.

96
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:17,549
And you will have to answer and you can write it from today the question, when Hahnemann talks about maintaining

97
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:32,800
 cause and exciting cause. In which paragraphs Hahnemann speaks about exciting cause and maintaining cause?

98
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:34,400
I don't know the German word which is in the Organon, but it's better not to have the exact word

99
00:19:34,401 --> 00:19:37,719
 so you can search more.

100
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:49,689
If you don't know the exact word, you may be reading the whole Organon to find what is this.

101
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:05,179
In Ign. of course we have, like in all remedies, two states.

102
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:17,419
One state is what we call the constitutional picture. That means somebody who needs as a remedy

103
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:22,839
the one remedy that covers all his symptomatology.

104
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:38,839
And then we have the superficial picture of a remedy, which is a remedy used only during in acute condition.

105
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:52,759
I will explain to you this which is very important because when we talk about the remedies, we speak about

106
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,569
 the constitutional type of people.

107
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:08,560
Here we have the chronic condition of a remedy which is Sep.

108
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:21,919
Underneath Sep. is another condition, which is Nat-m.

109
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:40,129
We have that individual who has not received any of these remedies, who goes in a big love disappointment.

110
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:56,279
On top of this picture, we have the manifestation of this, which is Ign. You put here sighing.

111
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:06,279
And you put here, another thing that
was not there, lump in the throat.

112
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:15,540
And you put here chorea or whatever. Ticks.

113
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,889
You see the picture it doesn't look clear here.

114
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,129
It's intermingling with underneath.

115
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:46,139
This remedy is added upon the constitutional remedies of the person. This is his underlying background

116
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:54,329
it's not an Ign. and on top of that background, another picture is imprinted.

117
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:58,320
Which stays for 1 year, 2,3,5 years.

118
00:22:58,421 --> 00:23:10,479
He comes after grief in 5 years and he has his ticks, his gastritis  his colitis, his problems and you give Ign.

119
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,399
and this goes away.

120
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:24,709
This is the same way as we see in an acute condition. In an acute condition, we have here, on a Sepia

121
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:31,600
Nat-m. background, this person gets an influenza.

122
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:42,839
You see Gels. picture is developing as the uppermost picture. So you see the picture of influenza

123
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:53,529
and you give Gels. then. It goes away and then underneath stays the picture of Sep. and Nat-m.

124
00:23:53,530 --> 00:24:07,009
The same with this bronchitis and develops a picture of Bry. Sometimes two remedies are on top like

125
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:10,239
Bry. or Acon. and Sulph.

126
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:21,519
Acon. and Sulph. can be indicated in a case of bronchitis or pneumonia, on top of this underlying pictures.

127
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:33,809
So the acute states in order to cure really, you need Acon. and then Sulph. Or you need Ign. and perhaps

128
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:38,999
one more remedy, the Ph-ac.

129
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:47,199
And then you go back again to the original chronic symptomatology of the person.

130
00:24:49,680 --> 00:25:01,759
Why we cannot say, when you see a patient try to find the deepest remedy? Why we cannot say that?

131
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:09,599
Because the deepest remedy here is Nat-m.
and he comes here with symptoms of Gels.

132
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:18,199
You cannot give Nat-m. and cure him. He comes with symptoms of Ign. You cannot replace with Nat-m.

133
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:24,439
You have to go step by step. First remedy.

134
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:50,440
And as I said before, it is possible that in a
case the uppermost remedy may go away...

135
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:12,760
...and there is a possibility that another remedy will appear before the underlying constitutional remedy appears.

136
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:20,959
That means you cannot say at any moment really, which is the constitutional remedy of the person.

137
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:28,709
Because that breaks down the idea,
what is your constitutional remedy?

138
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:37,679
There is no such thing as what is your constitutional remedy. There is such a thing as what remedy

139
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,969
 did the most good for you?

140
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:52,959
The most good for me it has been by Nat-m.  But in order to reach Nat-m.  you had to give the Sepia.

141
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:59,959
You gave the Sepia and the person says,
there are changes but I'm not well.

142
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:09,109
But the Nat-m. has come up again, as clear picture.

143
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:16,472
You give it and then beautiful.

144
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:29,719
There is a case treated. This remedy, that remedy... A case that comes to a homeopath master

145
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:34,015
after that touch, it improves nevermind what.

146
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:45,509
Even if the remedy is incorrect or what they think is incorrect. It opens up the way, so even another practitioner

147
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:49,199
 who is not a master, can see the next remedy very quickly.

148
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:55,509
And there is 'now I can see your remedy! Take Lachesis'.

149
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:09,229
I went to George, he gave me Sep., nothing happened and then somebody else gave me Lach. and beautiful.

150
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:18,149
Yes but why did not anybody give you Lach. all these years and now suddenly the Lach. picture is prominent?

151
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:29,059
For this reason. Because somebody took away the first layer and then the next made itself apparent

152
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:36,620
more clearly and then you feel the difference much deeper and much stronger.

153
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:45,799
This is the difference between confusing
 a case and clearing up a case.

154
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:05,549
He says, take drainage remedies. Drainage remedy what is it? To clear up the way, I will give you first

155
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:10,309
 in every case, Tub., Syph., Med. and Psor.

156
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:21,809
So if you take these 4 remedies, 4 times the day for the rest of the year, your case will become clear.

157
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:29,039
That is dangerous, that is nonsense, that does not exist. It will confuse more and more the case.

158
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:37,809
So more and drainage remedy, more drainage remedies, then they end up totally confused.

159
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:48,129
We have to learn what are the signs to recognize the first uppermost remedy. This is what we are learning.

160
00:29:50,120 --> 00:30:01,379
Except from sighing and grief and silent grief, we have changeable moods. That means the Ign. never feels

161
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:16,599
at an equal state. Either too high or everything
is dark and then suddenly it comes up again.

162
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:22,520
 That 's another possibility and then disappointment.

163
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:28,279
Changeable mood is therefore very strong.

164
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:41,439
And another idea which is very
strong is a lump in the throat.

165
00:30:51,020 --> 00:31:01,688
The emotions are filtered through
 the different parts of the body.

166
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:18,539
Here is a portion of the body, let us say the thyroid gland, this station which filters emotions.

167
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:30,059
And it says, you can pass so much emotions to my throat. If the emotions are more, they cannot pass.

168
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:34,559
I can only tolerate so much emotions.

169
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:48,789
With Ign. this portion is closed. That means she has either mentally or willingly, she has said, not too much

170
00:31:49,050 --> 00:32:00,440
emotions because I cannot handle. If too much emotions come, I will become hysterical and I will lose...

171
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:31,999
...self-control. I will lose my self-image,
 my integrity and I cannot stand that.

172
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,329
 Therefore the emotions that can
 go through here are so much.

173
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,719
But if the emotions
 are too much what happens?

174
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:51,239
Here it's blocked and she feels a constriction here. This constriction is because the emotions do not go through

175
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:56,379
and are constricted there.
 It says, 'no emotions, no emotions'

176
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:04,550
 and the emotions say. we must release, we must go out, we must cry and he says, no emotions, no emotions.

177
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:13,439
Then you have this conflict which ends up with a feeling of constriction here.

178
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:23,429
The constriction sometimes is terrible, otherwise it is less terrible. But sometimes people have almost constantly

179
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:30,679
 a constriction in the throat.
Because the emotions do not come out.

180
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:46,679
-Is it because mainly of their pride?

181
00:33:53,460 --> 00:34:01,189
-Well, it is the make-up of the person. The make-up of the person is such, you cannot say pride because

182
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:06,439
you go and look 'haughty'. No, it's not like this.

183
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:15,969
They feel that if the emotions overtake
 them, they will be ridiculous.

184
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:28,400
If you see an Ign. for first time
making a scene, in a romantic affair....

185
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:47,889
....try to say this is unfair, what you've
 done to me  she cannot say it.

186
00:34:49,490 --> 00:35:00,879
 She will make a scene, she cannot talk, she goes into spasms. That is why you have convulsions.

187
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:12,739
And then we have the chorea states. Or she will do the scene, she will do all these things but at the same time

188
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:16,959
she perceives, I'm ridiculous, what am I doing now?

189
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,760
Then she cannot stop. She goes over and over.

190
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:28,059
It is the organism who does this, she cannot control it.

191
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:38,619
So she knows that if I go into that state where I'm not controlled anymore, I will be ridiculous and she is ridiculous

192
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:46,719
 she does this, she becomes hysterical. She can even fall down and kick in a hysterical way

193
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:51,519
and then she knows that she lost the game.

194
00:35:51,520 --> 00:36:01,639
That's why I wanted to say before that the Ign's are not sent away by the boyfriends. The Ign's send away

195
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:14,999
the boyfriend before they can be so
much suffering, if the boy rejects them.

196
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:23,890
So they cut the relationship before the boy says, 'I had enough'.

197
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:28,519
I said the example with the Phos. and the Ign.

198
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:39,159
The Phos. can tolerate 1,2,3,4,5. In the end he will say or the Ign. thinks the boy will say, 'I had enough

199
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,249
and I cannot tolerate you anymore'.

200
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:49,659
Because she becomes close. They go to the appointment, they are close. What's the problem?

201
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:53,129
Do you have something? No, no.

202
00:36:54,160 --> 00:37:02,649
And then she goes all the whole afternoon. In the mind of the Ign. is, yesterday he was flirting with another one.

203
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:06,719
He says, what's the problem, you are not enjoying.

204
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:22,229
No, no I'm well. She will not say. She will keep it, she will keep it, it will start here. She will start sighing

205
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:33,500
blocked until such a time where she cannot hold it anymore. She says it and she says whatever she thinks.

206
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:52,199
-I wish to ask you if it's true that sometimes in chronic diseases by Ign., chronic cases I mean, they are suppressing

207
00:37:52,200 --> 00:38:03,039
 so much their feelings that maybe they
don't remember the origin of the silent grief?

208
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:12,519
Even if they turn the page and they are thinking that they are still needing this person and this person

209
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:17,779
is wonderful and it was a wonderful person?

210
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:28,519
-Not the Ign. This can happen with Nat-m.
This is another state.

211
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:37,539
They turn around and they live with their imagination. This is the Nat-m. that can do it.

212
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:45,119
When we speak about Nat-m. we'll say something similar of what you're saying.

213
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,780
-But Ign. not at all?

214
00:38:47,781 --> 00:38:58,509
-Not at all you can never say.
I never say never with the remedies.

215
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:16,239
Never say never because even in some cases we say, for instance Ars. is cold remedy.

216
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:22,280
Calc. is a cold remedy.

217
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:35,999
Yet you will get some cases where the
case is Sulph. and you have given Sulph.

218
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:45,269
and it's very warm person and now it's gone to a state of Ars. Is it going to be freezing? No.

219
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:52,949
The thing that will tell you is, I'm not as hot as before. Still it's hot and yet it's Ars.

220
00:39:52,950 --> 00:40:02,039
That is where people are confused many times. He says, now they tell us in the book that Ars. is cold

221
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:07,029
and I have found an Ars. who was warm.

222
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:18,719
Once the hot person started being
 not so hot, then it can be a case of Ars.

223
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:30,879
Here what we have to find, we said about cramps, the spasmodic effect, the chorea, the convulsions.

224
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,039
I showed you how they are produced.

225
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:45,599
What we have is aversion to fruit. Aversion to fruit is characteristic of most of the Ign. cases.

226
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:55,119
Most of typical Ign. cases they stop eating fruits. Once they go into that grief, no fruits.

227
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:00,839
It is very interesting, no fruits.

228
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:09,969
And also they cannot tolerate smoke of the cigarettes. Somebody smokes .... Even themselves

229
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:14,959
they can smoke and they can go into
Ign. state and they can stop smoking.

230
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:23,759
But especially the others. If there is smoke in the room, Ign. will just walk out, she cannot tolerate it.

231
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:34,369
But not as frequent as aversion fruit. Aversion fruit with Ign., we have almost 80% of the cases aversion fruit.

232
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:40,749
It's very seldom you get such percentage in these remedies.

233
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:58,889
And aversion to consolation, which we have to remember is a symptom which shares with a few other remedies, Nat-m.

234
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:08,850
Don't tell Ign. 'Oh! you are a good girl, stop crying'.

235
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:24,649
 It depends, if it's the mother, she will do like that. If it's somebody else, she says please leave me alone. Forget it, not for me.

236
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:35,529
-I have a question for the fruits. I often see that people don't realize I don't need fruits, I don't eat fruits

237
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:40,529
but it's not expressed as aversion.

238
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:43,429
They stop to eat fruits.

239
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:52,200
-Yes, they stop eat fruits and they don't realize, they don't remember exactly. I mean exactly this. Very well said.

240
00:42:54,370 --> 00:43:06,379
When you ask this question, they sit back, sometimes they will say, 'I eat and then wait a moment...lately

241
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:10,519
...now I remember, I don't ask for fruits'.

242
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:20,039
That kind, if you are having the grief, the
sighing, the constriction it's all confirmation.

243
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:38,319
Also one of the earliest signs of being grief, the organism changes in such a way inside that fruits are like poison.

244
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:56,959
-One question more. This aversion of fruits it can be combined with a desire for sour apple, for example?

245
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:03,379
Because they have also desire for sour apples.

246
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:11,639
-Maybe yes. If they have aversion to all other fruits, yes it can be combined with some desire. But if the desire for

247
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:22,679
 sour apples is very strong, then we may think
 of some other remedies like Calc-s. etc.

248
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:31,949
They need green fruit and sour, it's
Verat. etc. We will be talking about it.

249
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:44,679
Also it's a remedy that is not, as I said, a communicative remedy.

250
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:59,359
If some of you encountered an Ign. case, in your first taking of the case, most probably you will not be able to recognize it.

251
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:15,089
Because she will give you symptoms not of the emotions, symptoms which she thinks 'it's OK if I say this.'

252
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:28,439
Even symptoms like constipation, she will feel uneasy to mention. She will give symptoms like 'yes sometimes

253
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:41,479
I have some headaches and the headaches
 are this and that, desire for sweets yes. Then desire for salt, yes'.

254
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:49,239
 She will answers your questions but when it comes to 'are you close or open?'

255
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:53,999
'I think sometimes I'm close, sometimes I'm open'.

256
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:07,010
That kind of feedback. We will be discussing some of the taking of the case in the afternoon.
