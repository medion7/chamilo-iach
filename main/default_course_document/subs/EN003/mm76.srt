00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:38,439
Bar-c. is a very interesting remedy which
is indicated very frequently in our times.

2
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:07,370
Immaturity, lack of self confidence.

3
00:01:07,371 --> 00:01:15,079
Which is the other remedy that has lack
 of self confidence strongly?

4
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:22,189
Anacardium. I don't hear the whole class, you have to study more.

5
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:38,769
Immediately your mind should go Anac., Bar-c. Otherwise you will have a problem.

6
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:55,539
Bar-c. problem, forget easily, the mind
 is not strong, the memory is not strong.

7
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:08,319
What is the difference between the memory
 of Bar-c. and the memory of Anac.?

8
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:28,090
The difference is that Bar-c. loses her memory, forgets names, people, forgets proper names, words.

9
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:39,719
 it's a constant forgetfulness.
Anac. has sudden loss of memory.

10
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:10,840
In Anacardium it becomes chronic eventually, yes.

11
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:24,969
 They feel, I forget too much, more and more. As the organism degenerates it becomes more and more.

12
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:47,449
Here in this remedy what we see? We see the resistance almost of the human being to mature,  to become an adult.

13
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:57,200
She says, I want to stay like a child.
 I want the protection of my mother.

14
00:03:57,201 --> 00:04:09,209
She may be a woman of 30 years old. She says, I need the protection of my mother. I need to be protected like a child.

15
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:17,639
 I want to regress to my childhood, I want to regress to the uterus of my mother, where there is the most protection.

16
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:33,599
This is the idea behind Bar-c. I don't want to grow. I don't want responsibility, please don't give me responsibility.

17
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:49,270
They are wonderful people for companion because they never demand, as long as they feel protected

18
00:04:49,271 --> 00:04:55,359
they will stick in a relationship.

19
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:09,039
Even if they are abused because the insecurity is so much that they are terrified to go away from the protection.

20
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:21,799
This is similar to another remedy that we shall
be talking later on which is Staphysagria.

21
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:39,049
It's a remedy that you will need a lot in children and in old age. Old people who become like children.

22
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:53,800
You hear usually the daughter who gives the case of her father. She says, my father has become like a baby.

23
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,909
This is typical expression for Bar-c. because she does not know what she is talking about.

24
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:04,999
But the description is exactly of Bar-c.

25
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:21,520
That means the brain has been reduced, the arteries have been sclerosed and the whole human being

26
00:06:21,521 --> 00:06:26,619
is regressing, going back to babyhood.

27
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:41,919
The saliva is running, they feel no confident to go by themselves, they need protection, they forget everything.

28
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:53,370
They cry like children old people but it's not indicated only to old people; this is wrong impression

29
00:06:53,371 --> 00:07:08,840
because most of the Bar-c's I have given, were to students and especially students of Medicine. Medical students.

30
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:23,920
This has an explanation because in Medicine you are requested to use your memory so much and to remember

31
00:07:23,921 --> 00:07:31,129
so much that the brain is overwhelmed with information.

32
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:46,040
It gets tired and gives in.

33
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:55,539
It says, 'forget it, I don't want to learn anymore, I don't want to see anybody, I just want my mother.

34
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:02,359
I want to find a place where I feel comfortable.'

35
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:12,970
And then the insecurity comes and then the lack of self confidence and you get the same problem with the Anac.

36
00:08:12,971 --> 00:08:22,969
where they feel they worth nothing. They can not accomplish anything, they will not be up to the point.

37
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:29,219
You give them a job and they feel, 'I cannot perform'.

38
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:55,280
In the children a characteristic is that their tonsils are so swollen that close up the entrance to esophagus.

39
00:08:55,281 --> 00:09:04,170
They cannot swallow. The tonsils are
touching each other almost, like this.

40
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:11,119
Huge tonsils indicate Bar-c. possibility.

41
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:46,640
Also a characteristic is even children they lose their hair. The hair is falling and baldness in very young age

42
00:09:46,641 --> 00:09:59,889
 it may indicate, not always, Bar-c. Usually the pathology of Bar-c. is accompanied by falling of hair.

43
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,679
Strong falling of hair.

44
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:18,280
Aversion to fruit is another symptom to remember and this is a symptom which is also prominent

45
00:10:18,281 --> 00:10:23,039
 to which remedy that we will be talking about?

46
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,319
-Ignatia.

47
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:35,050
-Very good. You just learn these little
 tips and you will see. Ignatia.
