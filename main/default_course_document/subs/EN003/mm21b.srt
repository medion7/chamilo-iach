1
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:50,269
Ipecacuanha, you will need mostly this remedy in asthma of children where you see easy vomiting.

2
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:54,440
They cough a little bit and they bring up vomiting.

3
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:10,299
Asthma which is mostly in the age between 7 and 12.

4
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:17,779
That is the action of this remedy but this is not all of course.

5
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:46,819
It has very impressive effect in cases after radiation. The people are nauseated all the time and they have

6
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,979
bad feeling with nausea and sometimes with vomiting.

7
00:01:53,040 --> 00:02:03,329
In this case, Ip. will ease this situation without of course curing the cancer or curing the situation.

8
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:14,880
Also you use it in hemorrhage that is coming in gushes.

9
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:28,819
The blood does not run all the time, on the same speed.

10
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:39,850
Like vomiting. Vomiting which comes in gushes.

11
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:53,920
And then there is a big amount of blood coming out and then less amount. Then suddenly a little bit more and then less again.

12
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:18,899
These are cases where they look like Carb-v. case where they feel exhausted, they feel white with

13
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:26,429
tremendous feeling  of nausea as if the soul is coming out.

14
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:37,900
I don't know how many of you have been in the sea when it's rough and it affects you. Who is affected by the rough sea?

15
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:45,859
So all of you know the feeling. This is the feeling.

16
00:03:51,880 --> 00:04:02,179
Yes you can take Ipecacuanha during that time and it can help you.

17
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:13,889
Whooping cough where the child loses breath and vomits. And all coughs which bring out vomiting very easily.

18
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:25,899
It's not all children who  cough that have vomiting. It's easy vomiting with coughing.

19
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:38,129
You see the child coughs a little bit and then it's vomiting. And it is because of coughing that the vomiting comes.

20
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:47,409
Because if the vomiting comes without coughing, just like that and especially if the vomiting in small children

21
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:52,080
 is because of milk, it's another remedy.

22
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:18,769
Now here we have a symptom which is 'stomach feels relaxed as if hanging down'.

23
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:35,400
I'll give you a medicine because you laugh involuntarily. What is the remedy?

24
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,930
Cann-i. and then Ignatia and Nat-m.

25
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:51,389
Nervous laughing in serious conditions and she is laughing. Nat-m.

26
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:28,459
There is a kind of rigid, inflexible, duty bound and then fearful that a disease is coming soon.

27
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,700
There are two things that don't go together.

28
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:49,899
When the fear comes, they fear that a disease is coming. 'I feel my cells are degenerating.

29
00:06:49,960 --> 00:07:02,109
My tissues of the body are not doing well and I'm going to be struck by a disease'. This is a fearful condition

30
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:09,939
that does not go with the duty bound, rigid, inflexible individual.

31
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,419
So what is happening here is when you have that state, you do not have this.

32
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:31,909
Once he breaks down, when these people with all the composure, they're composed people, who not break down easily.

33
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:49,539
But once they break down, then the most difficult thing for them is to face the degeneration of their organism.

34
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:58,059
They feel that the organism is degenerating fast and a disease is going to overcome.

35
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:18,299
Sleeplessness, this is very strange. This medicine that is so rigid and duty bound will have sleeplessness so much.

36
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:32,899
It's one of the main remedies for sleeplessness, especially if the sleep comes for a few hours, then no more sleep.

37
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:52,690
Or they stay awake for 2-3 hours, from 2 - 4, from 2 - 5 and by 5 o'clock they doze again.

38
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:06,339
It is like if they have a clock. They say, 'it is as if I have a clock in my body that wakes me up'.

39
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:27,579
They look at the time, it's 2.00, 2.05, 1.55 every night. And when they fall asleep, they can fall asleep 11.00, 11.30, 12.00.

40
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:41,869
 Then around 2 o'clock they wake up. It's a biological clock that wakes up Kali-c. I have not understood why.

41
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:51,709
Most probably people who are duty bound they always have a sense that they have not done their duty.

42
00:09:53,540 --> 00:10:06,549
And if you have that, something underneath eats you up in the subconscious. That you did not do your duty.

43
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:22,859
Many times they have come to me and have said that the hours that they sleep, actually they don't .They are half awake.

44
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:35,459
That's why I say, their sleep is very superficial. Actually what happens is not exactly like that. They don't realize that

45
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:51,779
certain hours they go very deep, ex. for half an hour, and so they are able to relax, regenerate and continue with their sleep.

46
00:10:51,940 --> 00:11:09,269
But they will come mostly to be consulted for insomnia, for sleeplessness. The next thing they complain is asthmatic respiration.

47
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:22,160
Asthma, the lungs are affected. It's the weak point of Kali-c.

48
00:11:22,321 --> 00:11:28,580
Again the asthmatic respiration is worse between 2 and 4.

49
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:47,560
And all the Kali's actually they have an aggravation around this time, between 2,3,4,5.

50
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,430
Depending on what type of a Kali it is.

51
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:00,940
Worse from coition, why?

52
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:14,109
Because all the Kali's are people tired in general. They are very tired and they suffer with weakness, exhaustion.

53
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:23,360
So having sexual intercourse, does not refresh them.

54
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:43,519
Actually it is a matter of biological reasons that somebody is not refreshed  he's unrefreshed after sex.

55
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:50,859
 The sexual intercourse should normally refresh both.

56
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:59,779
They should feel both very well after sexual intercourse, as long as it is done properly.

57
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:17,380
Now you'll ask what is properly. I'm not going to talk about it.

58
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:33,040
We have little girls here. They will never come back again.

59
00:13:46,030 --> 00:14:05,250
I once treated a man who, every time he would have sex, for 3 days he would be out of order.

60
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:18,459
He says, 'I need to have sex but if I have, I'm lying in bed totally'. He was a medical doctor, a black man, an American.

61
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,939
And his life was totally upside down.

62
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:35,699
Of course he was intellectual and he was thinking all kinds of things. With sex you don't have to think, you do it.

63
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,709
If you start thinking, you're going to be unrefreshed.

64
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:59,869
Because you are leaving your life to the hands of the other person. So you don't do it just like this, lightly, if you want to really enjoy it.

65
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:17,219
Kali-c. is a closed remedy, it's a closed person that does not give in, does not give himself up.

66
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:30,739
As I said, not all police officers get Kali-c. but I have seen that this type fits the picture.

67
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:44,219
The picture is always the disciplined one, the one whose mind is here and not on top of the head and people

68
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:58,240
who will not open up and joke with you and make laugh. They are quite serious, rigid.

69
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:10,029
And you will see the kidney problems is the third problem on which they suffer.

70
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:34,350
And that is why you will see like bags under the eyes.

71
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:43,370
If the kidneys are not working properly, you will start having these bags underneath.

72
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:57,799
More especially the Kali-c. have bags here on the inner angle of they eyelids.

73
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:10,619
They have two bags here and full bags here.

74
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:32,459
Pain in the back, worse turning in bed. What it means? It means that they will say, 'it is impossible for me to turn'.

75
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:44,299
But if they get up, they can walk, they can do. They go to lie down and they try to turn, impossible.

76
00:17:44,360 --> 00:18:01,069
There is lumbago which usually extends down both the sciatic nerves. Not going right down to the ankles but on the thighs.

77
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:19,909
Asthmatic respiration also which is worse lying down, with the head low, forget it. Like another remedy, we talked about this.

78
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,440
Arsenicum, very good.

79
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:44,890
Now this one has the same and these people have to get up and either sit in that position

80
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,520
 or that position.

81
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:19,109
This is also a remedy which looks like Medorrhinum in this position of amelioration, which is the knee-elbow position.

82
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:26,769
The knee-elbow position in asthma or in children, they sleep in this position

83
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:34,449
and this position ameliorates their state, whatever it may be.

84
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:43,429
If they have a colic, they sit like that. If they have asthma, they will sit like this. Especially the children but sometimes

85
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:52,510
 you will see it in grown ups. And this is a position which is known with Medorrhinum.

86
00:19:54,260 --> 00:20:04,179
-In the Repertory we have found 3 remedies in the rubric 'too much sense of duty'. Can you make some additions for us please?

87
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:22,489
-Which remedies? Aur. also is another remedy, duty bound. Nat-m., the Kali's, most of the Kali's.

88
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:32,169
Except of the Kali-bi. Kali-i.You have to be careful. This is not a symptom unless it is exaggerated.

89
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:40,749
It has to be really exaggerated the sense of duty. I have not done my duty. It has to be exaggerated

90
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:49,863
to be a symptom because normally we accept responsibility and we accept duty.

91
00:20:49,880 --> 00:21:02,599
I have to teach never mind whether I'm tired or not tired, I come and teach. I accept this. I'm not sick because I accept this.

92
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:18,019
But if I go back home and I say, I didn't do well, I neglected, I should have been doing this and that and then I cannot sleep

93
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:27,259
then there is a possibility for me needing Kali-c. By the way I think maybe I need it.

94
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:43,679
-It's written in Allen, Kali-c. never give it in a fever.

95
00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:09,239
-I disagree because Kali-c. you will need it in that situation with dyspnea, the pain etc. You will see in pneumonia

96
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:23,979
in the later stage of pneumonia especially if it has reached hepatisation where the lung is full of mucus and liquid

97
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:31,700
then you will need absolutely Kali-c. The problem is that this is a deep remedy, like Sulphur, Calcarea etc.

98
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:52,779
 So if you give it wrongly, you may have some aggravation without the amelioration of course.

99
00:22:52,840 --> 00:23:03,299
And that is why you will see some people writing these kind of observations.

100
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:10,379
Another observation for instance, I don't remember now where it's written, is don't give Lyc. 200

101
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:19,299
 because it brings out big reactions. This is nonsense, it doesn't exist such a thing.

102
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:28,539
You give and if it brings out a reaction, it's the best. No problem.

103
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:41,569
Actually the reaction is not possible to be predicted by us in all cases. You expect some case

104
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:49,569
you have some reaction and you don't have and in another case there is a huge reaction which you don't expect.

105
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:57,139
But this can happen with every remedy, it's not only with Lycopodium 200.

106
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:04,200
Depends on susceptibility, pathology, how deep is the pathology.

107
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:24,149
In Kali-c. for instance, Kent has written don't give it in arthritis, if it is progressed. If it is there for years and you have

108
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:34,619
some deformities in the joints. If you already have deformities in the joints he says, be careful

109
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:38,379
because you can have a big reaction.

110
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:50,389
But later on we shall be talking about these big reactions and about reactions which can bring a kind of catastrophe.

111
00:24:51,930 --> 00:25:18,000
Kent's idea was, in one of his observations, he said: if you give and there is a big reaction, the patient may go...

112
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:51,409
He says, if you give a high potency in an incurable case, you will have an aggravation and the person will die.

113
00:25:54,730 --> 00:26:04,899
He said this but he said also something else which is in contradiction to this.

114
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:36,339
It's very good when you have a patient dying - in the chapter of euthanasia - you may be giving a high potency

115
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:43,589
 and the person gets ameliorated for a certain period of time and he dies peacefully.

116
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:53,489
Do you see the contradiction? Both cases are incurable. In one case, you give a remedy and what you observe is

117
00:26:53,550 --> 00:27:02,619
an amelioration, the pain subsides, the person is better and in 2-3 days he dies.

118
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:12,739
On the other case you give a remedy and he says, because the case is incurable you have a big reaction and then he dies.

119
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:23,659
So the truth is somewhere in the middle or a little bit different.

120
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:34,769
A propos of the observation, different things that have been said by different masters, teachers.

121
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:52,739
Even Kent, don't misunderstand me because what I know, I know from Kent and I respect Kent as nobody else, after Hahnemann.

122
00:27:53,560 --> 00:28:04,419
But all we make mistakes. I say a few things which later on I find out post not exactly like this but different.

123
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:14,279
So what I found out is that the observation of Kent when you have a severe case and you give a high potency

124
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:22,739
 you may have a big reaction. But this big reaction, does not mean that the person is going to die.

125
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:32,259
It means that during the time of reaction, the picture of another remedy is developing and if you see it

126
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:45,499
and you give it, the person will go to recover. That means you push the organism very strongly, the organism is giving now

127
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:52,869
a lot of symptoms. You observe, without losing your mind and then you will see another picture developing.

128
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:58,909
You give it and there is fantastic amelioration.

129
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:14,139
So when there is an homeopathic aggravation, not proving, then there is a possibility for a cure.

130
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:30,739
When we have incurable cases, we observe an immediate amelioration and then the degeneration

131
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:41,189
and then death, whatever. So in treating a terminal cancer case, what is your observation what it can be.

132
00:29:41,250 --> 00:30:00,699
You give Ip. and there is better, 2,3,5 days, then the symptoms of Bry. appear. There is pain, cannot move

133
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:13,059
give Bry. better 3-5 days, the symptoms of Rhus-t. Give Rhus-t, 5 days, 6 days, 1 day, very short amelioration

134
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:22,699
 and then another remedy and you can take this person to death, dying with amelioration, amelioration and then

135
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:27,699
of course death because the case is incurable.

136
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:35,939
Then we have the observation of Kent of euthanasia. He says, you want your patient to die in peace?

137
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:53,439
Give him a high dose of the indicated remedy and he will be sedated, will feel calm, his pains will calm down and he will die.

138
00:30:53,500 --> 00:31:02,429
They don't die always with one remedy. You have to give a few remedies before they die. But still what

139
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:16,019
we say is that we can ameliorate the last part of the life of a person who is in really incurable situation.

140
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:29,179
And when you have dealt with such cases, you have seen the difference. How much better they die with Homeopathy than Allopathy.

141
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:37,859
The problem is that they don't believe us. They will say if they had allopathic medication, he would have lived

142
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:46,580
 more or something like that. Which of course is according to our experience, is nonsense.

143
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:58,829
-I had a case with an old man, he had liver cancer and he came out of the hospital because they couldn't do anything anymore.

144
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:14,189
He couldn't eat anymore and he had this food what they give them. He was in a terrible condition and I gave him Ars.

145
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:32,089
and 5 minutes later he asked for ice cream. It took more than 3 weeks when he was at home and he got constipation

146
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:41,949
 and Bry. state came out, I gave him Bry. In 5 minutes they took him to the toilet, he was sitting

147
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:46,179
on the toilet for 3 hours, everything came out.

148
00:32:46,720 --> 00:33:06,029
And he lived another 3 days and had hallucinate and got to Opium state. I gave him Opium 200 and within 3 hours he slept.

149
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:11,129
-That's the experience I'm talking about.

150
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:21,619
This  information, what I have here is in every book of Materia Medica. It is not different.

151
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:32,029
I have especially taken care not to write anything new. So when you have it in your hands, it will be useless.

152
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:43,549
You have to hear what I say which makes it a whole. Otherwise these are just words.

153
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:53,189
Because I know what is going to happen.

154
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:12,369
You know the little book which is essences? The stolen essences. I taught Bill Gray, he was here and we were talking about

155
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:21,179
Materia Medica and he kept notes, then he left, he went back home. I said to him these notes are for you because

156
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:26,339
 I'm going to write the Materia Medica and don't circulate this because this is not the whole thing.

157
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:39,009
Most probably he had also mistakes inside etc. He went in 3 months after he returned, the whole world

158
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:55,009
was reading papers, the stolen essences. In England they printed. It says written by fairies, gnomes and I was

159
00:35:55,070 --> 00:36:05,269
in America in a Congress and as I went out with all the other people somebody comes and says, 'do you like this book?'

160
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:20,009
I look, it was typed written. I said, 'how much is this?'. He said '30 dollars' in 1983.

161
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:34,179
I said 30 dollars for this? He said, 'I don't know who wrote it'. It looks like mine. I said to Bill Gray 'I told you not to'...

162
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:40,689
He said,'they stole my apartment, they stole my notes'.

163
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:18,979
What is the idea with Lach. if you get a Lach. case?

164
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,569
She says, suppressed sexuality.

165
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,459
-Suffocation.

166
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:46,750
-Whatever discharge comes out, makes her better.

167
00:37:52,000 --> 00:38:01,459
The idea is with this remedy we have a passion inside.

168
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:14,059
Strong emotions that reach a strong emotional state.

169
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:38,299
People that are easily roused emotionally, with little stimulation  there is the need to express.

170
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:54,529
 It is absolutely necessary for this remedy to bring out the emotions, the discharges.

171
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:14,559
If this passionate condition is choked out somewhere, problems start.

172
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:29,029
It can be choked here like the Nat-m and then the constriction is felt here very much.

173
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:38,939
The constriction for Lach. is different than the constriction for Nat-m.

174
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:52,469
Nat-m. imposes a constriction upon himself. It says almost consciously, I'm not going to feel again this way.

175
00:39:52,530 --> 00:40:06,719
Lach. says, I want to feel this way but I cannot and there is a push from inside but the constriction

176
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:16,019
is there and there is a lump and the lump is felt almost like a ball which goes up and down.

177
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:23,219
They swallow and the ball is there and it goes down and comes up again, the constriction is there.

178
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:39,219
Here they cannot even touch this area. This area has to be free all the time, forget the tie.

179
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:57,300
If she has to wear zivago she has to pull it all the time.

180
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:20,459
The feelings or the emotions which are not going out, create a state in which you have the pathology

181
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:31,229
 which we call hypertension. Hypertension, the blood raises, the pressure in the blood raises and we have

182
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:46,739
typical idiopathic hypertension. In both men and women but especially with men.

183
00:41:53,280 --> 00:42:06,570
Women are more prone to express the emotions, to speak.

184
00:42:06,631 --> 00:42:25,729
Men they don't speak so much. The loquacity that we said  in Lach., we see it in 80% and only 20% in men.

185
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:37,829
Loquacity which is such that is changing from one subject to the other, jumping from one theme to another theme.

186
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:52,569
And then it comes all the time, she has to talk about it and the picture comes to the mind. What is the problem with you?

187
00:42:55,490 --> 00:43:05,459
 You ask one question the Lach. and the whole interview for 1 hour, she talks constantly without you realizing.

188
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:18,859
She jumps, she connects constantly the one subject with the other. The moment that she talks about her menses

189
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:29,219
she will remember that her niece also has a problem with her menses and also there was a friend....

190
00:43:51,360 --> 00:44:04,289
And you are amazed, in the end you sit back, you don't say anything. You just say Lach.

191
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:13,869
They say, do you have everything? After an hour? I say yes of course we have everything.

192
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:21,140
She has not given any symptom, she has talked about all her family, the friends of the family

193
00:44:21,201 --> 00:44:26,479
she has talked about how she felt when she was there.

194
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:51,499
And you just ask one symptom, tell me you sleep well? What happens? It's a characteristic of Lach.

195
00:44:53,560 --> 00:45:12,129
There is an arrested respiration, as they sleep or they go to sleep, the vagus nerve paralyses for a second and the respiration totally stops.

196
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:23,889
Then there is a feeling that they cannot breath and they jump in a terrible terror while they are going into the sleep.

197
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:42,229
It's a terrifying for them experience, they know it very well and they will describe it to you very much.

198
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:54,649
Jealous, loquacious, left sided complains usually, not always, worse before and after night sleep.

199
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:13,979
Arrested respiration during sleep that makes her jump with terror. Impossible lying on left side and cannot tolerate tight collars.

200
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:21,249
Ameliorated by discharges when the flow of menses starts. Worse by suppressing the discharges.

201
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:43,819
So a very characteristic thing for Lach. is to suffer during night. The whole night they struggle and they battle

202
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:56,170
but especially when they fall asleep and when they come out of sleep. These two times is the worse.

203
00:46:57,410 --> 00:47:14,029
 And if somebody says 'I get up in the morning and I'm feeling terrible, I feel rotten as if there is no need why I should live'.

204
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:26,679
In the first hours of the morning they are very depressed and they don't like to live. Their loathing of life.

205
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:39,569
Depression in the morning, this is a Lach. state especially if they tell you that I have been lying only

206
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:52,240
on my right side as if I turn to my left, I have palpitation. They have to turn back to the right.

207
00:47:54,240 --> 00:48:04,699
Tight clothes or tightness in general they cannot tolerate. Even touching makes them worse, in every pain.

208
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:15,959
 They have a headache, you touch 'oh!'. They have a pain in sciatica, you don't touch. They don't like touching.

209
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:22,270
They like sometimes to press the head.

210
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:34,389
Mostly we will see in Lach. it starts on the left side and then goes to the right the problem.

211
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:44,720
The same as Mercurius-iodine-ruber.

212
00:48:53,100 --> 00:49:06,099
Lach. can have a right sided headache mostly and mostly right sided sciatica. Why do we say left sided?

213
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:18,109
Because many times the heart is involved. And there is a fear of the heart but the heart is really involved in the pathology of Lach.

214
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:27,599
It's one place where there is the seat of emotions. We say symbolically is the seat of emotions. Why?

215
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:34,079
Because when you have emotions, the heart is pumping a lot, palpitations etc.

216
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:52,349
Lach. is an individual who is very egotistical, who wants everything for himself, 'I'm great', they feel they are important.

217
00:49:53,800 --> 00:50:13,399
They feel that life owes them to feel well and if somebody else if living well, this is not fair. They don't like it.

218
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:24,959
There is this cramp in the heart, the heart feels there is pain and the pain extends

219
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:29,639
they have a problem and they have fear of heart disease.

220
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:53,099
Lach. is pathologically jealous to the extent that a woman she was describing about the husband how he felt.

221
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:13,940
The woman goes to the grocery shop to buy something. The Lach. will come out of the window and watch.

222
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:26,230
She is delaying, I know now they do it.

223
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:43,449
The imagination is so much that they imagine that definitely now she is having an affair with the grocery man.

224
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:54,519
If the woman is unlucky and somebody is before her or 2 people are before her to buy and then she comes 3rd in line, she had it.

225
00:51:54,580 --> 00:52:03,899
Because she will be back and Lach.
will go into a rage, they will make a big scene.

226
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:14,760
'I know I have seen you before, you are flirting..' All this is imagination!

227
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:42,519
The woman telephones: I'm going to go shopping. The woman takes a friend and they go shopping, a girlfriend.

228
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:55,089
The Lach. will say 'wait a moment. She went out, she did not tell me that she was going out together;

229
00:52:55,150 --> 00:53:07,299
so they went together and they did it. Because I know this woman is of loose morals.

230
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:16,309
 So the other woman becomes of loose moral, the woman who promotes the other one, his wife, took her out...

231
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:26,869
Until the woman says, 'forget it. Let's separate. I cannot stand it anymore'.

232
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:45,939
Because when we say jealousy, we mean a pathological jealousy. Everyone who has live emotions

233
00:53:46,000 --> 00:54:00,919
and is connected with somebody romantic, erotic etc, they bound to be jealous. If they are not jealous, they are not healthy.

234
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:04,820
That means the emotions are somewhat dead.

235
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:20,079
But jealousy comes with a reason. They have a reason, they see it, it's true. Sometimes you can foresee

236
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:25,259
what is going to follow and that is the normal jealousy.

237
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:35,989
I'm talking about that kind of jealousy which is totally crazy. Totally out of the mind.

238
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:51,139
Then we have jealousy which is like Lach. or Hyos. It has similar jealousy with more suspicious behind.

239
00:54:57,730 --> 00:55:06,909
Another characteristic for Lach. is when the menses are going to come, just the day before when the organism

240
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:16,189
is pressing out the blood but the blood, the flow has not started, this time woman feels rotten.

241
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:29,659
The day before menses, forget it, they are irritable, dissatisfied, they are crying, weeping, sad, depressed.

242
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:41,419
The flow starts and everything goes away like a cloud, as if it was a cloud and it was lift.

243
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:49,140
I describe is as if I have menses.

244
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:07,339
Is Lach. a person who is sexual or asexual?

245
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:17,259
You can say sexual of course. He wants a lot of sex. They are easily excited.

246
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:30,321
And the children also they have the sexual instinct quite strong and this drives them to masturbation.

247
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:39,339
A lot of masturbation in children where it leaves them exhausted because the other state of Lach. is an exhaustion state.

248
00:56:47,720 --> 00:57:04,709
Waves come, pain comes in waves, heat waves, flushes of heat. That's why it's indicated during the climacteric period for a woman.

249
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:18,320
Also you can find Lach. who is not loquacious at all.

250
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:35,979
She is very quiet, not speaking a lot, especially if a Lach. is having normal sex.

251
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:48,059
If her sexual life is normal, she will not
need to express so much through verbal.

252
00:57:55,200 --> 00:58:07,999
It's the communication, once the energy of communication goes in a natural channel there is no need to express.

253
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:14,599
Once the suppression comes in a sexual level, then it starts talking, talking.

254
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:24,109
It's a replacement for sexual dissatisfaction or no satisfaction.

255
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:38,819
In Lach. we have actually a great remedy for contemporary people because we see a lot of high blood pressure cases

256
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:50,119
we see the suppression of the sexual energy is quite a lot in our societies.

257
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:04,579
As I said Lach. is passionate and can be hurt quite easily like Nat-m.

258
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:15,059
Not as much but they can be hurt and this time they withhold the sexual energy and then the blood pressure

259
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:22,389
 goes high, the headaches start and they need to talk about.

260
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:37,949
-Do we always have jealousy in cases of Lach.?

261
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:46,269
-No, we don't always see jealousy. There are cases that they don't have jealousy at all. Actually they will tell you

262
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:52,899
I'm not jealous at all but the jealousy takes another form.

263
00:59:55,040 --> 01:00:07,069
For instance, the woman is not satisfied and she always complain and find something to keep the attention of the husband.

264
01:00:08,410 --> 01:00:22,319
They don't feel jealousy, these cases they don't even have loquacity, they don't have jealousy but the husband will say

265
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:30,059
 'she never seems satisfied. She will always find a fault with me', she will always state as if

266
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:37,719
there is a subconscious jealousy where they don't allow the husband to act freely.

267
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:48,899
Always finding something to draw his attention until they drive them crazy. It's another form of jealousy.

268
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:56,369
You ask them and they say no.
Does she make a jealousy scene? They say no.

269
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:05,479
Where the expressive Lach. makes a jealousy scene. They cannot retain, hold back themselves.

270
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:22,029
The energy is so much that they will attack and they will be very vicious with their tongue and they will tell things

271
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:28,539
that hurt and things which are totally crazy.

272
01:01:49,850 --> 01:01:56,039
-What is the difference of jealousy in Anac. and the jealousy of Lach.?

273
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:06,789
-If the synthesis has Anac. in the same degree as Lach., is wrong.

274
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:16,770
Jealousy is not a big symptom of Anacardium.

275
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:33,839
Nux-v., Gal-ac also has jealousy quite strongly. Calc-s. you may raise it because originally in Kent's Repertory

276
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:40,819
 either was not there or was first degree. You can raise it to the second degree.

277
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:50,970
Calc-s. has strong jealousy but Anac. no.
