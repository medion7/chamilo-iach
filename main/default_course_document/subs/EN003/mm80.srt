1
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:36,539
The person who needs Sil. is a person who is rather sensitive and at the same time refined.

2
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:53,969
You start with Calc-c., he is more down the earth, you go to Calc-p. who is more refined and then you go to Sil.

3
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,009
These remedies are similar.

4
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:05,999
With Sil. you have more refined individuals,
 that means more unhealthy.

5
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,769
They can have problems.

6
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:32,430
Sil. is an individual who can perspire a lot and feels the cold very much and who has the nails affected.

7
00:01:32,431 --> 00:01:42,716
Brittle with white spots. That's Sil. which looks like what? Another remedy that we did?

8
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:51,399
 A lot of perspiration, very sensitive to cold?

9
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,700
A lot of perspiration, sensitive to cold, breaking the nails...

10
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,850
Psorinum..

11
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:20,149
Very offensive perspiration for Psor., offensive perspiration in the feet for Sil.

12
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:29,920
Sil. has acid and offensive perspiration
 of the feet, tremendously acid.

13
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:43,040
 Eating up the socks.

14
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,850
Offensive and acrid,especially the feet, nails brittle.

15
00:02:52,750 --> 00:03:01,280
Another problem that we see many times with Sil. is scoliosis. Curvatures of the spine.

16
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,629
And Sil. is one of the main remedies for constipation.

17
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:28,869
You have somebody who is rather thin, who is very sensitive to cold, very sensitive to drafts of air and who is

18
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:36,040
constipated, then you go to Sil.
 Then you say, show me your nails.

19
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:43,989
If they have a lot of white spots, it's a confirmation, if the nails are breaking it's a confirmation.

20
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:58,309
It is the remedy that will open up tumors and will drain the tumor.

21
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,759
You have a tumor somewhere, no matter
 where it might be, inside or outside.

22
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:15,369
It will open it, it pushes the organism
to open the tumor and discharge.

23
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:30,199
That's why sometimes the old homeopaths who are dealing a lot with tuberculosis cases, they were careful with Sil.

24
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:39,949
in case the infection is spread in all the lungs
 and then they had a big aggravation.

25
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:50,789
The same with Phos. They said, you have to be careful. The same with Sulph.  you have to be careful in tuberculosis.

26
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:58,449
But when Sil. is indicated in tuberculosis, there is no problem. You give it and it will not open up.

27
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:05,439
In the cases where it is dangerous is when it is not indicated, when it will have some proving, it will go to the

28
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,759
sensitive area where is the tumor,
 it will open it up and that's all it will do.

29
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:26,439
Of course it is a remedy that you will give in all cases when there is suppuration because of the foreign thing

30
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:38,959
 into your body, which is creating suppuration, Sil. will take quickly it out.

31
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:51,610
Sil. is a timid remedy and they get brain fatigue.

32
00:05:51,950 --> 00:06:04,389
This brain fatigue comes after mental exertion, similar to Pic-ac. and then they have a difficulty in appearing

33
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:14,929
 in the public. They feel their brain is not going to withstand the stress of having a public lecture.

34
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:39,159
Then they gather some mental power and like our friend whom we saw, she gathered all her mental power, she did well.

35
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:48,119
She said, 'finally I do well but I have
 to push myself a lot to do that'.

36
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:59,399
It's not easy to make a public lecture, to speak when there is an audience because I feel my brain is not strong enough.

37
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:08,080
The spine is not strong enough,
 the brain gets fatigued easily.

38
00:07:08,081 --> 00:07:20,289
The toxins are coming out through perspiration. That's why it is offensive but not all perspiration is offensive.

39
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:29,079
Where in Psor. the whole person is really offensive.

40
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:41,439
In Sil. is the feet. Sil. people will say, we wash 3 times the day, otherwise my feet would be offensive

41
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:51,508
 and some people will put borax or something like this, antiperspirant, very dangerous especially for Sil.

42
00:07:51,630 --> 00:08:00,290
You put this antiperspirant in your feet and next time what you have? Stones in the kidneys.

43
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:14,880
In 2-3 years you develop stones in the kidneys. It's very dangerous to stop offensive perspiration by antiperspirant.

44
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:49,719
Sil. also is one of the remedies who is afraid of pins or needles, pointed things. In the same way as Spig.

45
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:07,299
Fear of pins and needles Spig., of course fear of injections is Hep.

46
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,799
Yielding is not so.

47
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:56,899
These points you have to have to prescribe Sil.

48
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:05,649
You don't prescribe Sil. because it's yielding, timid.

49
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:15,840
Somebody has seen a Sil. who is not affected in this mental level, strong woman, it says strong will power, Sil.

50
00:10:15,841 --> 00:10:18,386
This is nonsense.

51
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:25,959
Strong will power is not a symptom,
it's the normal personality of the person.

52
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:34,449
And you have to have the points
that we're discussing to confirm.

53
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:44,599
Don't forget that it is very difficult many times, especially for young people coming into Homeopathy

54
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:57,320
to discriminate between personality
qualities and pathological qualities. It's very difficult.

55
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:07,639
And once they see it, they grab it and they give it as information and this is causing confusion.

56
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:22,449
We'll try to reduce all this confusion and take the real essentials, keep them there and stay with them, as much as possible.

57
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:42,949
Otherwise you will have problems. Of course Sil. wants her head covered like Psor. They are so sensitive to cold air

58
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:49,140
and to drafts that many times they have to sleep with a hat.

59
00:11:49,520 --> 00:12:01,759
They put their hat and they sleep because they are so sensitive and then some, like Bernard Shaw...

60
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:14,629
... had written comedies where you had these old people wearing their hat to go to sleep.

61
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,359
Most probably they need Sil. or Psor.

62
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:35,699
-Somebody has broken his leg and usually they are operated on and these parts have been fit together

63
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:41,609
with nails and screws. Constantly
 he is developing purulent abscesses.

64
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:48,759
All the symptoms point to Sil. then I would have very much the danger that the body would try to of the nails

65
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:55,119
and the screws, if I give it, correct?
 What possibilities do I have then?

66
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:08,129
-This is a good legitimate question. What I imagine would happen in such a case, if the organism creates

67
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:21,609
around the foreign body, pus and inflammation. Inflammation, antibiotics, inflammation. If you give Sil.

68
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:33,969
you stop the inflammation. And what is going to happen? These are nailed, Sil. cannot push it out. What it will do

69
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:50,199
it will reduce the tendency to inflammation on the one hand and maybe it will open up a place from where the discharge

70
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,209
will come out and then it will heal.

71
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,330
I will not be afraid to give it in case Sil. symptoms are there.

72
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:07,439
 If the person is Sil. definitely is going to help.

73
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:20,399
-You said Sil. is timid and gives in very easily. Isn't that a very superficial giving in? Isn't she very strong

74
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,639
behind because that is what I read about it?

75
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:33,250
-You see the yielding comes from Kent.

76
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:45,399
 I don't pay much attention to that. That's why I say, it's yielding it's timid, you are not going to give Sil.

77
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,655
Most probably the person is normal in that respect and you don't have to say it has a strong will power

78
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:02,599
therefore he is not Sil. no.

79
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:09,399
Strong will power is a characteristic of his personality, you can give it.

80
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:18,349
I don't take it also that Sil. has strong will
power, as a symptom, No, I will not take it.

81
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:28,739
This most probably comes from people who have observed superficially and give out information on a superficial level.

82
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:41,369
You say, somebody has a will power strong or weak will power. It has to be really weak power, it has to be

83
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:49,119
 confirmed again and again and has to be,
after the remedy, changed.

84
00:15:49,120 --> 00:16:00,799
What is a will power? It is, am I going to be well? Yes, you are going to be well. Then he waits outside here...

85
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,359
...'Mr. Vithoulkas am I going to be well?' I said
 'yes, you're going to be well, don't worry'.

86
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:16,379
Then next morning, he waits for me in the street. He says, 'Mr. Vithoulkas shall I get well?'. 'Yes you will get well'.

87
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,109
This is a weak will power.

88
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:27,489
He has a problem, he comes again and again. You give Agaricus and then he doesn't come back.

89
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:34,229
This is my observation. When I teach I say about these things.

90
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:42,469
If somebody comes and tells me, 'I have a weak will power', like this lady whom we saw yesterday she was saying

91
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:46,633
I have a weak will power. Everybody will believe it. I will not believe it.

92
00:16:46,733 --> 00:16:55,799
 I want to see what kind, the situations, what is a weak will power, where, how it's expressed.

93
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:01,560
 It's so difficult to say it as a symptom.

94
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:29,439
We have Stram. when we have some type of aggression.

95
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:50,159
It is very seldom that Stram. will be indicated where there is no aggression. There is no violence.

96
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:58,159
When I say violence, I mean in the appearance of the symptoms, as well.

97
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:14,009
So Stram. is a remedy which can express that which is inside, which is on the subconscious and can express it

98
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:18,509
 in a violent manner, in a violent way.

99
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:31,499
We realize that these persons have kept inside them a lot of dark element, what we say the dark element.

100
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,079
It's a heavy darkness.

101
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:46,160
And it is indicative that they cannot stand external darkness.

102
00:18:46,161 --> 00:18:56,719
If you have a Stram. and you sleep in a dormitory and you switch off the light in the night, even if he is asleep

103
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:03,239
 he will wake up in a terror and will jump to open the lights.

104
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:22,280
The fear of darkness is so much which indicates the condition in which the person is living.

105
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:31,319
Yet, in spite of this description which I make, you may imagine somebody who comes in front of you

106
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,729
 and he is violent, no.

107
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:44,039
They are very controlled and very nice and can be very sweet when they are in the consultation room.

108
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:54,809
But then they will say from time to time or when time comes, the fit comes, the anger comes, the violence comes

109
00:19:54,810 --> 00:20:02,319
 and the violence is hitting, striking and killing.

110
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:12,320
It's not the desire only to kill, they kill. They
have to complete the action of violence.

111
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:23,800
Hyos., who is a similar remedy, has the desire to kill. It's very interesting because I cannot understand

112
00:20:23,801 --> 00:20:29,670
desire to kill and kill, what is the difference? There is a difference.

113
00:20:29,752 --> 00:20:43,939
Hyos. will tell you, 'I have the desire
to kill constantly'. 'Whom?'. 'Anybody'.

114
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:59,679
But they do not go ahead and detonate
their anger by doing some very violent thing.

115
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:10,199
Where Stram. will really take a knife and will charge and hit and then you see the aggression.

116
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,439
They hit children, the mother, the father.

117
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:24,689
They will attack, they are tremendously aggressive and violent in their fit of anger.

118
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:36,289
Children usually that develop Stram.
symptoms have been terrified by parents.

119
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:46,529
There is a little one here, 5 years old and he plays, he does this, they say, 'shut up!'. He continues.

120
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:58,799
The father grasp him and goes to the balcony and says, 'I'm going to throw you down now. You shall stop, yes or no?'

121
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:13,299
Great fright and then slowly that child develops symptoms of aggression. Eventually you enter the house

122
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:20,119
 it doesn't matter who you are,
he looks at you and goes and hits you.

123
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:39,799
Ailments from fright. People who got a
fright will develop symptoms of Stram.

124
00:22:56,210 --> 00:23:02,800
I have seen it also in women who
 had an experience of incest.

125
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:13,889
This experience is so frightening,
 that they go into convulsions.

126
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:31,199
So the convulsions of Stram. are very aggressive convulsions. If you look at these convulsions and what they do

127
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:41,799
 and how the muscles are in spasm, all the muscles are in movement and in spasm, it's frightening.

128
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:51,459
They express all this subconscious fear which is underneath.

129
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,990
Violence, fear of the dark...

130
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:33,209
 ...and fear of animals, especially dogs.

131
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:41,850
The idea of a dog is so frightening to them.

132
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:59,959
 It is like projecting their violence with the violence with which a dog can attack you. It becomes so terrifying.

133
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:22,079
And then the darkness is connected also with closed places, closed and dark is terrible. Going through tunnels

134
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:32,879
going through places which are dark and enclosed, forget it. They will go into panic attacks.

135
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:46,920
It's a remedy also that is given in
old times when we had rabies.

136
00:25:55,490 --> 00:26:08,319
 This idea of biting, you know the aggression
 of rabies and the fear of the water.

137
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:15,909
In such cases they have tremendous fear of coming near the water. How is that, why is that  I don't know

138
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:25,869
physiology wise. But definitely
 there is a great fear of water.

139
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:41,319
In their every day life they cannot
 have water running over their heads.

140
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:50,299
 To put the shower and the water runs here in front of the face, they think they will suffocate.

141
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:57,229
There is a fear of suffocation, especially if the water runs over their head. They say they cannot breath.

142
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:12,569
 They are terrified, the children will scream and will just throw the shower, they will go out.

143
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:26,859
We have to understand Stram. as this subconscious darkness which is there and the violence which

144
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:34,839
comes out and expressing itself in fits
and then it becomes very sweet.

145
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:56,839
Of course they will be afraid of being alone, especially in the night. The night comes and they are alone, they don't like it.

146
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:13,519
It is not a matter of wanting company, it's a matter of being exposed to an element of which they are very terrified.

147
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:28,449
 It's very interesting that this violent remedy, so violent that they can kill, they themselves are afraid of being injured.

148
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:39,269
Either the same person may have both the violence and the fear or they may have only the fear of being injured.

149
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,959
Fear of being injured and there is no violence.

150
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:55,400
Fear of being injured to the extent... The woman says 'I'm afraid to shake hands'

151
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,759
A strong German says 'I'm very glad to meet you', the Stram. 'ah...'

152
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:16,469
 This handshake is an injury for them.

153
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:23,129
-Can you differentiate the violence of Merc. and of Stram.?

154
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:36,610
-Merc. is not a violent remedy.
 It has violent impulses.

155
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:47,040
 The impulse to do violent things,
 to throw things to counter attack.

156
00:29:47,041 --> 00:29:59,269
 But there is not danger with a Merc. With a Stram. you are in danger, once he is in this violent mood

157
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:10,170
 because in Stram. we have a remedy with which we are dealing with serious mental cases.

158
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:22,669
You can understand the convulsions, the intensity, the violence, the hitting, the grimaces, the whole thing

159
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:31,399
 which comes out is a violent scenery.

160
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:44,239
- A patient after doing his A levels, he finished his school, he went to Turkey and came back with strong symptoms of mania.

161
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,319
After coming back he could not stop talking anymore.

162
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:56,359
He was talking constantly and he had strong dellusions he would be the best, the nicest, the best looking

163
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:07,880
 the biggest in the world. I saw him after he had been treated in the hospital with tranquillizers like Lithium.

164
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:20,679
 First he came in a severe depressive state and we actually take out Lithium. I gave him Nat-m. and fitted well.

165
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:27,909
After some weeks he developed some problems with his eyes. He always thought he was seeing everything in double

166
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:31,809
and he had a problem with the coordination of his muscles.

167
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:49,329
After giving him Stram. 1M, everything disappeared within 2 weeks.

168
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:57,839
And psychologically he was also very stable again.

169
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:07,589
-I have two questions about Stram. First is do they forget after having this violent states and second

170
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:13,919
 what is the differential diagnosis with Anac. that can also have these two states, one violent phase

171
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:17,439
and one rather tender phase?

172
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:28,659
-Of course they remember. When you see such cases and I have some in video, you will see the child is sitting there

173
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:34,249
 it's so sweet, so calm, answering the questions.

174
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:45,970
And the mother says, he rushes and describes the violence, the boy looks like an angel.

175
00:32:45,971 --> 00:32:51,559
You don't perceive the violence in front of you.

176
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:59,519
This is what I said. We describe like this and you say, this is a case of Stram.? It's not possible!

177
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:04,309
No, no it's possible because Stram. comes in fits.

178
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:15,489
Unless of course is on the last stage of schizophrenia and he is in a state completely gone.

179
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:22,209
-How is the stammering of Stram.?

180
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:30,449
-Stammering also is very strong and
 it has to be compared again with Merc.

181
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:45,209
But the Stram. stammering is much more violent than the Caust. or the Merc. stammering.

182
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:50,200
It is aggressive stammering.

183
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:01,210
You see the grimaces!

184
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:19,769
It is two forces that want to come out and say "mother".

185
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:28,599
 Mother is a nice word and so violent behind, this stammering.

186
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:36,049
It's the same, the idea of violence is behind. The convulsions.

187
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:43,439
- I would like to share with you a personal experience we went through with my son, who broke

188
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:50,119
with epileptic fits and Sil. helped him
immediately when he got it the first time.

189
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:59,789
And then about a year later, he was attacked by a psychopath, very badly, and brought a fit and nothing could help.

190
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:11,099
8 months later he was given Stram. and it took all the epileptic fits at once. After 8 months of constant fit

191
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:18,329
and no other remedy allopathic or homeopathic helped and Stram. took it immediately away.

192
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:31,279
-My question is regarding the fear of water. Is it a fear of water itself or the fear of suffocation?

193
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:39,409
For example, we have some case where the mother explains that the daughter is very afraid of even slight wind.

194
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:45,439
When the wind is blowing at the face, she can't breath, she makes like this....

195
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:54,679
-That's not Stram. There are two things about water. The one is the claustrophobia. It seems that for them

196
00:35:54,680 --> 00:36:06,200
 they are closed, there is no air to breathe
 but because of this water falling. And the other is the shiny surfaces.

197
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:25,869
 They bring them this violence from the sub-conscious. They don't like to look at the mirrors or calm water,  shiny.

198
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:36,599
They have fear of water. They say, 'I don't like to go to the sea, to the swimming pool, I don't like to swim

199
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:41,209
 I don't like to be with water'.

200
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:50,229
-From my experience, I've seen it frequently, patients who are taken away their heroin, who withdraw themselves

201
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:54,929
 from heroin, they often come into a Stram. state.

202
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:16,339
-Yes, the withdrawal syndrome, it can be very aggressive and many times of course they can have the picture of Stram.

203
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:24,457
They go to the sea. If they can go to the sea at all, they will say they will never look at the bottom of the sea.

204
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:31,529
The moment you go there and the sea
becomes dark inside, they are terrified.

205
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:52,309
Face hot and red with cold hands reminds
 you of Bell. Bell. also has the violence.

206
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:18,829
Something else also which I have mentioned many times in this course concerning Stram. are the fears again

207
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:21,799
from the subconscious which come with children.

208
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:30,119
Children are sleeping, they are very nice, the whole day no problem, they are sleeping and suddenly

209
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:39,649
in the night they will wake up with a terrifying nightmare.

210
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:50,869
And they wake up screaming and looking in terror and the mother goes and says, 'what's your problem?'

211
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,559
And the terror is there.

212
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:15,729
Almost every night they will go into that terror and of course many of these children will leave the bed

213
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:19,399
and go to sleep with the mother the rest of the night.

214
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:26,779
The terror is so much that they need to feel the contact. As soon as they are in contact with the mother

215
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:34,029
then they go back to sleep. But these nightmares, this kind of nightmares which are precursor (George said it)

216
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:46,509
of epileptic fits of convulsions if they are staying, they are coming many times out of vaccination and they are treated

217
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:51,839
 very well in the beginning stages with Stram.

218
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:58,439
-In Alzheimer's disease sometimes we also see this violence. Can we give the Stram. then?

219
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:07,539
-Yes, if there is violence definitely.
Convulsions, distortions of the face.

220
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:22,840
And the fear of darkness is a primary element but the fear of darkness you have to understand as that fear

221
00:40:22,841 --> 00:40:36,320
which comes from the unknown. The darkness is when you don't see, from these elements you don't see the monsters...

222
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:45,120
-George  I recognize in my grand child, she had a frightening experience, terrifying experience and then she developed nightmares.

223
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:53,519
Terrible nightmares and fear of dark but she was never violent. When she was conscious, she was never violent.

224
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,759
Do you recognize this also that they don't have to be violent?

225
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:08,859
-These children seldom are violent in their daily life. The violence comes with the fears when they arise

226
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:13,129
from the sub-conscious level. You enter the
sleep in order to relax. What do you do?

227
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:31,829
 You take away the logical mind. The logical mind is finished, then the sub-conscious takes over.

228
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:48,409
Once the sub-conscious takes over...there are cases of nightmares for 20 years, especially after incest.

229
00:41:51,320 --> 00:42:02,619
The child does not know what's going on and then finds out and that terror comes and the nights become

230
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:06,609
really nightmares.

231
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:14,369
-When you described the child, waking up at night, having nightmares, the next day when you ask the child...

232
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:25,169
-They don't remember. But you have to have the child waking up in terror, real terror because there are

233
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:32,679
a lot of other remedies that have nightmares.
Real terror and shout and they cannot wake up.

234
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:41,639
They see something, you are sure they see something there because they are so much engrossed in

235
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:46,500
that, that they see. Then it is Stram.

236
00:42:52,840 --> 00:43:06,559
The woman will shout. The husband is terrified. He says, I had to sleep in the other room.

237
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:18,989
Every night? Every night the same thing, that's Stram. If he wakes up and says...it's not Stram. It's different.

238
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:39,959
-I had one Stram. case with an 9 year old boy some years ago but it was very impressive.

239
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:48,919
The mother came to me because she did not know what to do. She said, the boy is terrifying the whole family

240
00:43:48,920 --> 00:44:00,779
 and especially her. He always had to know where she is. So as an example, when he is at school he stands up

241
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:08,079
 during the lesson and say, 'I now have to phone my mother to see where she is'. And he was very afraid

242
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:22,689
 and he got very aggressive when he could not find the mother. That lasted  for half a year before she came

243
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:30,949
 and I asked what happened? She told me she had missed the boy in the town, when she was shopping

244
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:38,579
and he was lost in a big shopping center
and they get back some hours later.

245
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:51,089
And since then it was like this. He had very much anxiety in the night and the light had to be on...

246
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:58,039
-And many times these children they
get up and they go with the mother.

247
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:11,039
-Yes, he doesn't want to be alone at all. He had very big, dark eyes, when he looked at me it was terrifying

248
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:21,809
and he told me that when he looks at his hands, he thought they are very big and that makes fear to him.

249
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:29,609
-It's very interesting what he says, which I had noticed and I have said it in other lectures, that there is

250
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:58,669
a darkness in the face. Very thick eyebrows, with dark eyes and it's very strange, not all of them.

251
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:15,099
It comes a woman with premenstrual syndrome, with severe, cramping pains and signs like that in the face, they will lead you.

252
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:21,179
I remember a case in the very beginning, premenstrual syndrome, what the hell is this now?

253
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:25,909
And I saw the face.

254
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:34,339
-In a very little child with terrible
nightmares must be the fear of dark?

255
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:49,339
-No, not necessarily. If these kind of terrors wake up, with that kind of terror, that is enough for Stram.

256
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:58,719
-I've got a relative in Germany that after a bomb attack in the war, during the war at age 3, she developed

257
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:04,981
this stammering with grimaces
 in the face. And she had it for 45 years now.

258
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:15,429
Now the last 5 years, she has been going under psychotherapy, so the stammering came down a little bit.

259
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:22,959
But now she is rather in a depressive state, with hanging eyelids and she is not very well.

260
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:35,609
And she never had any signs of violence. Whether one could think of giving Stram. as there is no violence there?

261
00:47:35,610 --> 00:47:39,559
-Yes, yes, yes.

262
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:42,779
-Do we have restlessness in Stram.?

263
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:55,840
-Yes, it's the violent movements than restlessness.

264
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,499
-Can the aggression also go towards oneself?

265
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:10,999
-You mean like suicidal or hitting yourself?

266
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:18,979
I don't know, I cannot answer this
question. I do not have cases like this.

267
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:32,789
-Stram. is also a big remedy for violence of drunkards and I remember a case of a person who regularly

268
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:43,469
when he was alcoholised, would come home, beat up his family, get all the furniture and mess everything up

269
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:46,207
and Stram. helped really a lot.

270
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:56,229
-Exactly, the idea is that the logical mind goes away and the sub-conscious takes over, whether it is in sleep

271
00:48:56,230 --> 00:49:06,280
or in waking state, it's the same idea. Alcohol takes the logical mind away the sub-conscious takes over.

272
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:19,629
The idea is when the sub-conscious takes over and this sub-conscious is violent, then the idea of Stram. comes.

273
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,959
Darkness and violence.

274
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:38,149
-My question is, if you've got children of violent parents, can this evoke a violent state in the children also?

275
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:47,305
-Sure. One time, I had a very interesting phenomenon.

276
00:49:53,640 --> 00:50:12,119
In a family, the father of the woman died and her husband did not have good relationship with his father in law.

277
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:15,539
Aggressive relationship.

278
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:30,519
After this death, it came this terrifying situation for this man, where he could find no rest at all.

279
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:39,029
After the death of his father in law. Could find no rest. Tremendous fear, he had to put on the lights  and to stay

280
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:46,759
the whole night awake. He could not rest,
could not sleep and it was going on.

281
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:55,250
Then it came the idea of Stram., I gave Stram.

282
00:50:57,790 --> 00:51:11,589
Then what happened is that the wife who was very nice, sweet, no connection with Stram. at all, she started having

283
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:17,799
 this fear of darkness and that irritability.

284
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:27,779
For a nice person to have irritability and anger, she says what is this? I have some anger, I want to hit my children.

285
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:36,910
And then Stram. calmed her down and
 then the children developed ticks, Stram.

286
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:41,839
 And then the other one Stram., the whole family.

287
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:52,179
I could never explained that phenomenon, I have never seen it again. What was it, something in the house?

288
00:51:54,930 --> 00:52:06,399
I still do not understand this kind of phenomenon. The whole family had to be pacified out of an aggressive state with Stram.

289
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:12,320
Very interesting.
