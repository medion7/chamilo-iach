1
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:39,000
So we go to Nat-c.

2
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:46,760
We have this nice remedy.

3
00:00:50,480 --> 00:01:05,619
It's a remedy you will give usually in cases where you will see a life long problem with stomach.

4
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:13,279
If there is a sensitive spot for Nat-c. this is the stomach.

5
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:29,760
Stomach troubles of any type. Mostly gastritis, duodenal ulcer and dyspepsia.

6
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:36,559
They eat little and this little they eat, they cannot digest.

7
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:54,369
Especially if the food contains some milk or they try to drink milk. For them it is difficult to digest milk and they have aversion to milk.

8
00:01:54,370 --> 00:02:06,359
It is one of the main remedies that have aversion to milk. So stomach problems with aversion to milk, goes straight to Nat-c.

9
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:15,209
If you have these two symptoms, go straight to Nat-c. You don't need anything else.

10
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,990
Aversion to certain persons.

11
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:40,079
It is interesting that Nat-c. people are sensitive, like all Natrums but sensitive especially to the presence of certain people.

12
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:54,189
The cannot tolerate the vibrations, the presence. They don't have to say anything, the presence, they are sensitive

13
00:02:54,190 --> 00:03:03,599
in receiving the impression of another person and say, I don't like you. And they will leave, they will go out.

14
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:14,999
 Usually this happens with women. I have not seen this with men but with women I have seen they cannot

15
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:23,259
tolerate a specific person. 'They are two persons I cannot tolerate, if they come to the room, I leave'.

16
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:33,960
They can be relatives or whatever, they cannot tolerate. It is a kind of hysterical almost reaction.

17
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:47,959
They are the people also who will not demand for themselves things.

18
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:56,199
They will not say, me first. Always it is the other person first.

19
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:06,549
You will say, is this pathology? We said serving others is good, is healthy. Yes but in Nat-c. goes to the extreme

20
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:19,289
where she likes to serve others, she likes to be the servant of other people. Not servant meaning something lower

21
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:47,079
but it is their desire to provide protection, food, whatever the other persons are needing, without making themselves present, aware.

22
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:53,780
We have other remedies which manipulate others. One of them is for instance is?

23
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:09,719
Where they boss other people, it's Chel.

24
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:28,379
Lyc. is different. They are not interested in the other person. They say, 'give me this, give me that', they are dictators.

25
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:45,339
The Lyc. does not say, 'this is best for you, you have to do it. You have to dress like this and you have to go tomorrow

26
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:59,849
 to see the minister, and do this and that'. No. These are the Chel., Dulc., other remedies. Lyc. will be dictator

27
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:10,440
'give me this! Why don't you give me this?'
They behave like little dictators in the family.

28
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:24,409
Nat-c. is not a person who manipulates, who tells you what to do.

29
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:35,309
It serves you like the wife who stays always in the background and what is your need, she provides.

30
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:41,069
Without making herself, neither they want to make themselves present.

31
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:54,229
I am a very important person and some people come. I have a Nat-c. wife, she will provide everything, she will leave.

32
00:06:54,930 --> 00:07:02,039
The Lach. will stay there. The Dulc. will stay, the Chel. will stay to protect you.

33
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:15,119
They will tell you what to do. Not in a dictatorship, this is different with Lyc. Lyc. do not really care.

34
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:24,839
When we say Lyc. don't think that all Lyc. are of that type.

35
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:34,339
Because as I said, you may need Lyc.and you have only digestive problems. That's it. Mentally-emotionally you don't need Lyc.

36
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:49,079
You are normal. So don't confuse it. Sometimes we say she is Plat.or he is Nux-v.

37
00:07:53,960 --> 00:08:03,989
To accuse somebody by the remedy he is supposed he has taken. He took Nux-v., we know what it's all about.

38
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:10,349
No you don't know because you don't know whether he took Nux-v. because of indigestion and Nux-v.

39
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:14,909
is one of the remedies that has indigestion.

40
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:32,409
We're talking about Nat-c.  still you have not seen the Nux-v. Both they have indigestion but totally different person.

41
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:52,419
They have to really pay attention to what they eat. They eat very simple food and they eat little amounts.

42
00:08:52,420 --> 00:09:03,879
That is why they are lean usually, the stomach is inside and the shoulders are like this.

43
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,129
They are lean persons.

44
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:21,039
Nice persons with everybody except of certain individuals.

45
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:29,279
If you get this, indigestion with aversion to certain people, that's Nat-c.

46
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:36,199
Usually in 90% of the cases you will have to have the aversion to milk. 'Milk? No I don't like'.

47
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:49,719
From 'I don't like' to 'terrible for me'. Or if I drink any kind milk my stomach is very upset.

48
00:09:52,120 --> 00:10:00,519
So sometimes we are lucky and with 3 words, the person sits there and says, 'I have stomach problems'.

49
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:09,959
You say, 'what about milk?', 'Don't even mention it to me'. The case is finished. Next.

50
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:28,990
Later on he says, 'I feel so well, this is gone, fears are gone'. You say, did I do it myself? You wonder.

51
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:43,069
Chronic effects of sunstroke is another. Nat-c. is the most sensitive to the sun out of the whole group.

52
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:53,229
Nat-m. is the second and Nat-p.  is the third. But this one is very much affected by the sun or the heat.

53
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:08,009
The sun is such a poison for them that even the sun falling on their head for seconds, it becomes unbearable.

54
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:17,999
They have to walk with a hat. They are people who are having a hat all the time and it they are going to pass

55
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,719
 from one pavement to the other into the sun, they will go quickly. Not to be exposed too much into the sun,

56
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:33,849
 very sensitive to the exposure of the sun. And therefore very easily having sunstrokes.

57
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:48,269
After effects of sunstrokes. I had a sunstroke and since that time I have stomach problems, headaches, whatever.

58
00:11:48,270 --> 00:12:00,509
You give Nat-c.  after effects of sunstroke. The whole thing, my problems started after sunstroke.

59
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:17,769
Great debility caused by summer heat. We had some heat waves in Greece, 2-3 years ago and in the Center

60
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:28,199
we had a lot of cases of Nat-c. They said, 'after the sunstroke after that summer I have this problem or that problem'.

61
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,169
 Different problems. You don't have to have only headaches.

62
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,400
Can anybody tell me why it's so much indicated?

63
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:29,840
Because of the sea? Sea is 75% of the earth.

64
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:44,430
Salt is a big element for the sea, an important element, a mineral which is easily disturbed in the body.

65
00:13:48,160 --> 00:14:01,579
Especially disturbed when you feel insulted or even worse rejected.

66
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:21,200
Fear of rejection to the extent that the person will say 'I will never go to that situation again. Never again!'

67
00:14:21,301 --> 00:14:35,160
And they can close so much that it becomes like a wound inside. Like no emotions. Esp. towards the situation

68
00:14:35,161 --> 00:14:54,680
which brought them this grief. What is this situation? Usually it's a situation of rejection in a relationship.

69
00:14:54,681 --> 00:15:04,720
Most of the cases of  Nat-m. will relate to you that their problems have started after a relationship in which they went

70
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:17,320
innocently. Giving themselves to the relationship and then being hurt deeply by the other person.

71
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:31,760
Like Ign., Nat-m., has strong emotions. They are not people without emotions. They're people with strong emotions.

72
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:44,000
When I say strong emotions, I mean intense. Emotionally they are not strong. They are weak people, that means

73
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:52,530
they don't have much resistance on the emotional level because you can hurt them so easily!

74
00:15:52,561 --> 00:15:54,049
And then we have insomnia from grief. They cannot sleep because of grief. You get that suffer with insomnia for years.

75
00:15:54,050 --> 00:16:06,930
They work in the office, they enter the office and some people are there, and somebody forgot to say goodmorning to them.

76
00:16:06,931 --> 00:16:14,039
Then they immediately take notice of that and they start thinking 'what have I done? Did I do something wrong?

77
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:25,050
Why he didn't say goodmorning? Most probably yesterday I did something, I said something, that hurt this person.

78
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:35,840
And then they go to bed to sleep and they think of this kind of things. Next morning they go and ask.....

79
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:41,790
'No, I didn't see you. Did not say goodmorning? I'm sorry'.

80
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:57,619
But the impact of such little thing is exaggerated. Now if the thing instead of being small is big, then the reaction

81
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:07,120
is tremendous and usually brings out not problems with the stomach but with the head. Headaches.

82
00:17:07,121 --> 00:17:19,919
And the headaches are headaches which start in sleep, after the end of the sleep. In the morning they wake up

83
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:26,680
and they have a headache. And the headache continues until the afternoon usually.

84
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:39,050
Another type of headache is the headache starts about 10 and continues until 2 or 3 in the afternoon.

85
00:17:39,051 --> 00:17:54,600
Such a headache esp. if it has the character of being like hammers beating, it's only Nat-m.

86
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:09,069
Also the grief they will keep inside. They cannot express it. They will not talk it over. They cannot talk over

87
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:19,030
their grief even with their wives, husbands. Even with the closest person, they feel that if they tell this grief

88
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:29,640
they will be ridiculed. They are afraid also of the reaction they may have. They may have a terrible reaction

89
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:38,910
and become really ridiculous.

90
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:52,670
Being ridiculous is something that stops them from doing anything.

91
00:18:55,570 --> 00:19:06,320
If they want to cry, if they need to cry and cannot resist it anymore, they will go into the room, close the door,

92
00:19:06,321 --> 00:19:20,489
go to the bed and cry there. Cry totally to themselves so nobody can hear them crying.

93
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:29,279
The same like the Ign. Ign. and Nat-m. are complementaries. Sometimes you start with the Ign.

94
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:41,360
esp. if the grief has produced this sighing but the grief is deep and you have to complete the action with Nat-m.

95
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:59,190
Of course such individuals who are so sensitive, so much reacting it is natural that sometimes the reaction will be

96
00:19:59,191 --> 00:20:14,590
towards the hysteria. Hysterical reaction.
If they break down, they cannot express emotions in

97
00:20:14,591 --> 00:20:24,810
a normal way. The expression is so much, so intense that we have a hysterical kind of a reaction.

98
00:20:24,811 --> 00:20:34,000
They cannot control anymore. They feel it and they protect themselves by not going into such situations.

99
00:20:34,001 --> 00:20:41,760
But once they are in the situation, they cannot control anymore, they are acting hysterical, they make themselves

100
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:51,689
ridiculous and that is the end. Also in a romantic situation what happens usually with a Nat-m. is that once

101
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:59,519
they have done such a scene they feel that they have been ridiculed, fall in the eyes of the other person

102
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:08,220
that they cannot anymore come back to the relationship. They feel the other person has seen them

103
00:21:08,221 --> 00:21:20,359
being so low, so ridiculus. And all this goes into their mind and they go to sleep and cannot sleep, all this comes

104
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,999
to their minds. 'I did this, I did that' and all bad things which happened, they happened in the time

105
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:40,599
 when they lie in bed and they try to sleep. And then we have insomnia from grief. They cannot sleep because of grief.

106
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:50,530
 You get people suffering from insomnia for years! With bad thoughts when going to bed.

107
00:21:50,531 --> 00:22:02,770
Everything that happens, happens during the time of lying in bed. And that is Nat-m.

108
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:06,959
One question you are asking and the question is what?

109
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:16,129
This little secret here, desire for salt is a big secret for Nat-m.

110
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:34,679
You just ask 'how is your desire for salt?'. They  say, 'I take the salt and make it white'. That is Nat-m.

111
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:46,099
If they say, 'I take the salt and I put salt' is different. 'A lot of salt' is different remedy and 'I make it white

112
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:50,260
I put so much salt' is Nat-m.

113
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:57,939
-They don't have aversion to salt, does this exclude Nat-m.

114
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:02,680
-No, it does not exclude.

115
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:27,680
If they just put like this it's Carb-v. If they put a little bit more is Verat. and Phos. If they make it white, it's Nat-m.

116
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:37,959
So this is something also that you have to take into consideration. Many times I've seen in the analysis of a case we make

117
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:49,159
I say no this is not a case of Carb-v. They say why? There is desire for salt.

118
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:56,889
 Yes but the desire for salt is the desire which Nat-m. has and not the desire of Phos. or the desire of this.

119
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:10,619
In the Repertory you have some kind of degrees but even between the same degree you have differences.

120
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:17,619
So you are learning slowly the type; is this the type with the desire for salt?

121
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:29,599
If there is somebody who comes to you and sits in front of the office, you're sitting there and he comes there and he is full of life.

122
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:37,959
He says, 'what do you want me to say. I'll tell everything'. 'Do you have desire for salt?'. 'Yes'.

123
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:54,719
That is Phosphorus. You cannot say, but he has headaches 10-2 or 10-4, I say yes but better be careful.

124
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:01,229
Because he is not the type of Nat-m.

125
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:14,939
And if you are not able to differentiate and to see this sage you will not be able to say what is. You will always be confused.

126
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:26,799
Is this going to be Caust., Ign., Nat-m. It's a lot of remedies that can be each case. How to differentiate?

127
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:34,719
You differentiate by seeing whether the combination of what he says in each totality.

128
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:55,029
Yesterday we spoke about Merc. You take <i>the</i> combination because if you take the pain after operation you are led to Staph.

129
00:25:55,030 --> 00:26:07,619
But if you take the whole of the history of the person the combination, it's the combination which leads you to the solution.

130
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:19,389
-I have a patient who is the Natrum type and I've given this and it was a relief but it was very deep grief behind.

131
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:29,639
It's a very old person, I didn't dare to give more than 200 each time because she was so weak.

132
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:41,369
And now there is a big desire for sweets and she is more open now but still there is a lot of grief. I wish I could go on

133
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:44,487
with a higher potency but still I don't dare this.

134
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:57,069
-No. If the desire for salt is less and on the other hand the desire for sweets has increased, most probably she is shifting

135
00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:06,409
 to another remedy, most probably to Lyc. They are complementary; after Nat-m. Lyc. many times is indicated.

136
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:19,939
So you see if the digestion, the bloatness and the gas is there, it's developing, you don't have to have so much gas.

137
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:27,360
A little bit of gas, it's going towards the Lyc. situation.

138
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,760
They cannot urinate in presence of others.

139
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:51,959
Because of the same sense of being ridiculed. Others seeing themselves and they would make comments or say something.

140
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:58,850
That's why they cannot urinate in the presence of others.

141
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:28,799
Aversion to fat is another strong point for Nat-m.  If you have desire for fat, it will make you think twice before you give Nat-m.

142
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:38,209
All the other symptoms have to be very strong to overcome the desire for fat in a Nat-m. case.

143
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:58,010
Fat and slimy, like the white of the egg when it is not boiled, forget it, he says 'uh..take it away'.

144
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:04,769
Desire for fish also is quite strong and farinaceous food.

145
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:23,559
Chicken and more the internal parts of the chicken, the liver, the guts of the animals. These parts specifically

146
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:32,669
they don't like and also chicken, I found out many Nat-m., they cannot eat chicken.

147
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:43,999
Aversion to the sun and of course photophobia.

148
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:58,909
Sun usually will bring headaches. If they lie in the sun for 10-15 minutes, the headache starts.

149
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:13,159
That's why they say, 'I like to lie down but for 5 minutes, not more. Because if I stay longer, then the headache starts'.

150
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:30,209
Also they are people who are having, if they are affected in this level, a lot of anxiety, hypochondriacal anxiety.

151
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:39,549
'My blood pressure today is so much, I have a pimple here, I have some headache. Do I have cancer?'

152
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:56,919
They keep on telephoning you for a lot of little things, which you know they don't have but for them it is a source of worry.

153
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:08,120
They bring out very easily these herpetic eruptions here in the lips. Recurently.

154
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:23,199
So if they are not assured, they are worried about this which is nothing.

155
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:40,679
Also they can hear that this is some point where somebody started a cancer. He saw some mucus in the stool

156
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:47,559
and then immediately they can search and find mucus in the stool. And then they can telephone and say

157
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:52,399
  'I have mucus in the stool'. 'What do you mean?'. 'Well I don't know'.

158
00:31:53,880 --> 00:32:01,409
So usually we don't pay attention because they are not affected in this level but if they are affected

159
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:06,320
they are one of the most hypochondriac patients.

160
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:17,279
The organism that has taken a lot of remedies  I found out that becomes insensitive to the right remedy

161
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:22,869
  and you may miss it, thinking it's not acting.

162
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:34,119
And that is why I'm in the habit, in such cases where they have taken a lot of remedies, I repeat 3-4 times.

163
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:43,649
Even high potency, in the beginning, the same potency every day, 3 days.

164
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:07,610
10001,10002,10003. If you can dilute it and succuss it a bit take one dose higher.

165
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:35,229
Nat-s. I have found out of the Natrums, is the most healthy one in mental-emotional level.

166
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:47,239
Usually you get no symptoms, very balanced people that they have either asthma, the lungs are weak

167
00:33:47,240 --> 00:34:05,269
 or the digestive system is weak. In this remedy we see an aggravation between 4-5 a.m. in the morning

168
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:17,559
which is very characteristic especially in asthma. Asthma which is aggravated between 4-5 a.m. usually indicates Nat-s.

169
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:26,749
In such cases you try to get symptoms of the mental-emotional and you do not get.

170
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:46,739
But if by chance you have a case of a grief and after grief you see the desire to die but serious desire to die

171
00:34:46,740 --> 00:35:05,479
very serious suicidal tendency the person feels that he has to fight all the time to counteract this tendency and it says

172
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:19,849
 'kill yourself, shoot' and then they say 'No. I must not do it because of my father, my mother, my children, my husband.'

173
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:31,909
They try to resist this tendency to kill this depression which brings immediately to the desire to shoot themselves.

174
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:42,439
But at the same time there is a resistance and a battle that they must not do it, because they will give great grief

175
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:46,759
to their people, whom they love.

176
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:57,239
And it is this idea of balance inside them that you see when this is not overthrown, you see a balance

177
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:03,779
in spite of the fact that they lost their children, their loved ones.

178
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:14,439
They keep a balance and when the balance is lost, the organism tries to bring a balance by counteracting

179
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:23,449
the tendency to suicide by saying, don't do it because you will give bad feelings to the people that you love.

180
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:32,159
And they are able to control it though they suffer quite a lot because of that tendency.

181
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:56,319
They are people who are balanced, who are healthy, who are successful. Whatever they do, they will do it correctly.

182
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:05,129
They are correct people. And when the grief comes is so much, they say 'why should I live now? There is no reason'.

183
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:13,359
But they have their children. I remember a very characteristic case of skin eruption.

184
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:20,639
I was called to see the man in Belgium while I was treating Krishnamurti.

185
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:30,969
And I saw him with his nurse and his doctor who also was a homeopath. I'm talking about 1966.

186
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:40,199
And he showed me the eruption, this is the eruption, you give a remedy.

187
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:59,189
And he was a very rich man, aluminum industrialist in Belgium, very proper and I tried to ask certain questions.

188
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:02,959
I could not get anything.

189
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:15,879
At a certain moment he told me, he lost
 his wife. He had lost his wife about 2 years ago.

190
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:25,149
'How do you feel?', 'Well, what can I do? It's a matter of fact'.

191
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:36,909
Then I cannot remember he gave me something, I looked in the Repertory and the idea of Nat-s. came to my mind.

192
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:52,239
Now how shall I tell him 'do you have suicidal tendencies?'. And his daughter was in front. His daughter, his nurse and his doctor.

193
00:38:52,690 --> 00:39:05,169
So you know the situation. Rather young in1966, that means I had only 6 years of experience in Homeopathy.

194
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:14,919
And I see this case, he showed me his eruption, I said God, give me one good symptom. But the idea of Nat-s.

195
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:27,999
came to my mind because he did not look like Nat-m. OK, he lost his wife but he said 'OK. I accepted, what can I do?'

196
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:34,549
But since the loss of the wife he had this skin eruption.

197
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:42,319
 Some grief is there? No, Nat-m. is not Ign.

198
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:58,739
And I thought of Nat-s. and I said to him, 'do you perhaps have thoughts of suicide, which you're trying to control

199
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:02,010
 because you don't want to hurt your daughter?'.

200
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:11,079
He goes like that to the doctor. 'This man is undressing me'.

201
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:24,599
I said, thank you very much. I say to the doctor, 'give him Nat-s'. In a few days the whole thing was disappearing.

202
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:37,329
You see, from this little information you can make a cure that looks miraculous where nobody else can do it.

203
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:51,609
I had not still that moment met exactly that situation. It was the first time I was meeting a Nat-s.

204
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:55,589
and these suicidal tendencies.

205
00:40:55,590 --> 00:41:04,000
And the way he said it, 'this man is undressing me here', it means I described exactly how he felt inwardly.

206
00:41:04,001 --> 00:41:13,719
Of course you will see this remedy develops in damp weather; it does not like damp weather.

207
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:36,749
If people stay in damp weather they develop either joint problems or lung problems, whatever. Then you may think of Nat-s.

208
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:56,929
Another characteristic is photophobia which is quite strong and this remedy is considered as a remedy which is sycotic.

209
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:00,400
They call it sycotic.

210
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:10,599
Why? Because we see a lot of condylomata and warts in its symptomatology. Increased sexual desire.

211
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:28,269
The sex desire usually is normal. With Nat-m. for instance, you have a characteristic, I go back because I did not mentioned this.

212
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:39,019
You get a characteristic deviation I would say. It's not exactly deviation but for Nat-m. who is so timid

213
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:54,870
you don't expect that during sex they talk shamelessly. They like to say words which excites them in sexual fashion.

214
00:42:56,620 --> 00:43:04,729
And they become shameless. It says in the Repertory 'shameless during sex'.

215
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:13,689
Why? Because they need to be excited, they need to hear or to say these kind of words.

216
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:27,699
Because they are closed and do not allow themselves in real life anything of that type, when they become loose

217
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:39,969
 then they can really become shameless. In the same way they cannot talk but if they drink they become very loquacious.

218
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:51,209
So you have in cases of mental aggravation, loquacity in Nat-m.  quite a lot or in order to speak, they have to drink.

219
00:43:51,210 --> 00:44:05,969
So in Nat-m. you see this kind of disturbances where in Nat-s. I don't remember a case where usually

220
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:14,119
they will say I'm normal with sex and do not have fears.

221
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:19,360
Very seldom you will find a fear in Nat-s.

222
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:30,759
I mean I don't know the picture of a Nat-s. insanity. I've never seen it.

223
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:43,759
And there is a great characteristic which is 'cheerful after stool'. After stool they feel really good.

224
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:52,759
It is automatic. I don't know what is stimulated there.

225
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:13,519
Headaches also which are connected with liver problems or with liver dysfunction are covered by this remedy.

226
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:24,649
-One question to Nat-s. They have this feeling of duty. Would they have Aurum too? I mean concerning suicide?

227
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:34,569
-Yes you have similarities with Aurum. The difference is that the Aurum suicidal tendency does not have the element

228
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:53,119
of trying to control it. When they think of suicide, they think what a nice thing to happen. If I die, the Aurum says, it's very good.

229
00:45:53,120 --> 00:46:00,379
They invite death, they like death. They think of death and they feel relieved.

230
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:10,729
These people they think of death and they say, 'oh what shall I cause to my children? What grief shall I cause to my wife?'

231
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:25,639
-There is a question to Nat-s. When somebody got a dose of Nat-s with asthmatic condition and after 2-3 days

232
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:32,809
 the asthma disappeared but within 4 weeks it comes back, what does it mean?

233
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:37,549
-Either the potency was too low or you need a repetition.

234
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:55,549
-It was an M thousand.
-It can be low for them and you can try repeating the remedy, let us 6-7 times.

235
00:46:55,550 --> 00:47:07,559
Because it means that either the potency is low or the pathology is quite strong and it comes back easily.

236
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:15,309
But if you have a general amelioration and asthma amelioration, that means the remedy is correct

237
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:19,039
you should not leave it. You should repeat it.

238
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:43,889
- Maybe there is a problem that people are taking drugs against asthma. You can give also C12, some homeopaths

239
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:53,389
 are giving high potency and because of these drugs you can repeat for a long time C12.

240
00:47:53,390 --> 00:48:04,119
-Definitely you can repeat in low potencies if people take cortisone. It's very difficult to treat homeopathically.

241
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:17,039
You will have a big problem unless you still have a clear picture of a remedy. If you have a clear picture

242
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:26,679
even with cortisone, you will see beautiful reaction. But cortisone masks the case, does not give you a clear picture

243
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:29,291
 and therefore it's very difficult for you to find the right remedy. Therefore you go slowly reducing cortisone

244
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:43,709
while the patient is improving a little bit and if you are lucky in 2-3 years  you manage to take him away completely from drugs

245
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:48,700
 and you manage to have
 a clear picture. If you are lucky.

246
00:48:49,240 --> 00:49:01,759
In the beginning of my practice when I came to Greece for the first time, I got all such cases. All cancers, epileptics

247
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:11,279
asthmatics with heavy drugs and I struggled with all these cases in the beginning, very much.

248
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:20,210
I have quite a lot of experience from such cases and that is why I give you now my experience.

249
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:38,129
You will waste a lot of time for a case, a lot of energy. For one case you may be dealing every day with problems

250
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:41,000
before you can bring them around.

251
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:54,280
 Cortisone is a terribly powerful hormone which changes the whole defense mechanism totally.
