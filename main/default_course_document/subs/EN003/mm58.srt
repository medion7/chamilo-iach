1
00:00:16,077 --> 00:00:17,085
Thuja

2
00:00:18,021 --> 00:00:25,994
I will give you some keynotes of Thuja.

3
00:00:27,186 --> 00:00:57,706
Thuja is a very interesting remedy because was used quite a lot in older times
when vaccination for smallpox was a general practice and side effects of vaccination appeared to be manageable with Thuja.

4
00:00:58,743 --> 00:01:16,736
I don’t know why, I don’t understand, an old homeopath Burnett found
that whatever side effects were produced by smallpox vaccination were nullified by Thuja.

5
00:01:17,392 --> 00:01:30,681
I remember myself being vaccinated as a child, usually the smallpox vaccination made a tumor and left always a mark.

6
00:01:32,536 --> 00:01:39,280
I still have the mark in my thigh.

7
00:01:40,856 --> 00:01:49,759
This tendency is a very characteristic of Thuja.

8
00:01:51,664 --> 00:02:04,217
It has the tendency to produce warts, excrescences, moles, growths in general.

9
00:02:08,904 --> 00:02:14,488
It affects the glands, produces swelling of the glands.

10
00:02:22,224 --> 00:02:46,584
If you will see a person who is a typical Thuja person
and you look at him you will see all over big moles, warts, and growths.

11
00:02:47,504 --> 00:02:56,272
It’s a pantheon of growths! It is true.

12
00:03:04,992 --> 00:03:21,432
The skin is quite oily, greasy, hair is greasy but the hair itself is very dry.

13
00:03:25,032 --> 00:03:33,095
Have you seen these youngsters today who put gel and make the hair like this?

14
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:37,240
This is almost typical of Thuja.

15
00:03:38,072 --> 00:03:46,833
If you see them their hair stands and you touch their hair and it’s not soft. It’s hard.

16
00:03:59,976 --> 00:04:20,384
If we go to physical characteristics for men we see very frequently
swelling of the prostate gland and many times cancer of the prostate.

17
00:04:38,106 --> 00:04:55,834
I remember as I child all the children praying together, most of the children had these warts in the fingers.

18
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:09,426
Once these growths are out there is no danger for the organism.

19
00:05:09,834 --> 00:05:17,066
The danger comes if they cauterize these growths.

20
00:05:19,034 --> 00:05:32,522
I remember a case we had seen, a woman who had come for mental problems, almost psychotic woman.

21
00:05:40,282 --> 00:05:51,042
She had been for years to a gynecologist who was cauterizing the growths in her vagina.

22
00:05:54,026 --> 00:06:08,714
She told the story, cauterized again came out and so on, said ok give Thuja.

23
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:19,026
She became well and then the warts were out again!

24
00:06:21,706 --> 00:06:39,596
She goes to visit the gynecologist and he calls us and told us that you gave a remedy
and the growths I’ve been cauterizing are back.

25
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:44,626
We said not to cauterize them. Don’t do anything anymore. You will see.

26
00:06:45,842 --> 00:06:59,850
The gynecologist became a follower of Homeopathy because he was impressed
because the warts were gone without cauterization.

27
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,970
This impressed him.

28
00:07:03,682 --> 00:07:13,401
Did not impress him that she was mad and she became well,
impressed him that the little growths there disappeared with Thuja.

29
00:07:14,218 --> 00:07:24,850
He said give it to me to give to all his patients.

30
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:31,481
Actually this gynecologist had a house here in Alonnisos.

31
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:38,066
Excuse me but my trousers are falling down!

32
00:07:39,658 --> 00:07:45,257
- Hyos.!

33
00:07:51,594 --> 00:07:54,986
– Sulph.!

34
00:07:56,162 --> 00:08:04,699
Totally shabby! I don’t think I am quite in that state yet.

35
00:08:10,563 --> 00:08:27,642
Anyhow, the cauterization and the suppression of this kind of growths
are very dangerous for the psychological condition of the person.

36
00:08:28,651 --> 00:08:34,394
Not only that, he can actually produce states like cancer etc.

37
00:08:39,347 --> 00:09:08,707
How do we recognize apart from these characteristics, the oily skin, the dryness of the hair, the perspiration has a sweetish smell 
also characteristic and something else which is very simple for you to remember is the aggravation from onions.

38
00:09:09,027 --> 00:09:20,220
They cannot stand onions but some other case you may see desire for onions.

39
00:09:20,405 --> 00:09:28,476
You can see both desire and aversion to onions but the characteristic really is the aggravation from onions.

40
00:09:29,204 --> 00:09:47,515
They will tell you that if I eat a tomato salad where onions have been cut in the salad and
I take the tomato because onion had touched on it I have an upset system.

41
00:09:48,531 --> 00:09:51,843
So sensitive they are to the onions!

42
00:09:53,923 --> 00:10:05,124
These are the little things which can make your life much easier.

43
00:10:18,947 --> 00:10:40,011
Going to the mental state of Thuja; it is very difficult for a homeopath to see a Thuja case from his character.

44
00:10:40,563 --> 00:10:44,237
The reason is he’s not an open person.

45
00:10:47,828 --> 00:11:02,540
Not only that but he is somebody that may give you misinformation just to check out if you can find out that this is misinformation.

46
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:10,035
They don’t realize it depends so much on the information that they give and has to be accurate.

47
00:11:11,092 --> 00:11:15,923
What does this have to do with my case?

48
00:11:17,251 --> 00:11:23,459
I do not see any connection, so why should I tell him?

49
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:36,604
So, he gives information which is wrong. In this way they hide, they are sneaking.

50
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:55,246
They are intelligent people, critical, people who take care of themselves quite a lot and take care of their pleasures.

51
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:27,046
They have a relationship and in this relationship they get some pleasure,
they will not show it to the other person so they will not depend on the relationship.

52
00:12:28,965 --> 00:12:44,773
When you show that you have a kind of weakness towards that person you become dependent.
Thuja will protect himself and not show this kind of dependence.

53
00:12:52,246 --> 00:12:59,536
They will not give information about their life, in general.

54
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:04,575
They will keep half of it in the dark.

55
00:13:11,566 --> 00:13:45,399
Their sexual desire is quite strong but it is earthy, a sexual thing.
Med. need the erotic element, they flirt, say nice things. With Thuja there is sex.

56
00:13:46,967 --> 00:13:49,799
The other is nonsense.

57
00:13:56,439 --> 00:14:02,470
They will go easily in a relationship which has no emotions.

58
00:14:04,023 --> 00:14:14,112
Therefore one understands that the emotional side is not really complete.

59
00:14:17,327 --> 00:14:29,255
It is an individual who is lacking in flexibility in the emotions.

60
00:14:35,727 --> 00:15:03,727
If somebody is very practical in sexual matters, in relationships, that means
the emotions are not playing a major part, is like a hardness of the emotions.

61
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,551
The emotions in their natural state are very flexible.

62
00:15:11,223 --> 00:15:15,591
You feel joy, sorrow, change.

63
00:15:17,222 --> 00:15:20,638
They have don’t have many changes.

64
00:15:21,374 --> 00:15:32,991
They’re fixed, immobilized.

65
00:15:33,949 --> 00:15:40,924
Because the emotions are the “weak” part of us.

66
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:54,661
Because if you love somebody you are weak towards that body because you don’t want to lose it.

67
00:15:55,837 --> 00:16:11,749
There is a weakness. Vulnerability. Thuja doesn’t want to be vulnerable.

68
00:16:16,188 --> 00:16:22,724
Cannot tolerate it. Therefore the emotions become hard.

69
00:16:23,572 --> 00:16:38,204
So this idea of hardness, callous… In Greek we say you are “callos” because your mind is stuck, fixed.

70
00:16:39,836 --> 00:16:47,637
You have tumor in your brain, a callous. It’s the same idea.

71
00:16:51,476 --> 00:17:00,388
The soul makes callouses, hard growths underneath.

72
00:17:03,133 --> 00:17:10,348
The same idea of callous, hardness is with the emotions.

73
00:17:17,172 --> 00:17:36,436
This picture, this patient, this pathology eventually may lead to fixed ideas.

74
00:17:54,589 --> 00:18:04,969
Obsessive or compulsive. He gets an idea and cannot get it out.

75
00:18:06,025 --> 00:18:10,153
That is so. Whatever it might be.

76
00:18:11,538 --> 00:18:28,290
And there is a peculiar state of mind which sometimes they go into a state where they feel that the body
is brittle and can break, it’s made of glass.

77
00:18:31,962 --> 00:18:35,289
This is very interesting.

78
00:18:36,961 --> 00:18:43,971
You see the hardness, the inflexibility and I am going to be broken!

79
00:18:44,940 --> 00:19:03,780
This is an idea which comes because of a deeper weakness.

80
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:19,628
These people can be very hard with others. If he is in the army he can give orders.

81
00:19:20,548 --> 00:19:23,468
Kill them!

82
00:19:25,067 --> 00:19:35,348
They are hard but behind it it’s the fear they make break down and go crazy.

83
00:19:36,748 --> 00:19:50,740
And this whole situation of growths, hardness comes as a secondary stage of gonorrhea.

84
00:19:52,668 --> 00:20:03,860
This is not known in medicine, they are know the different
stages of syphilis;

85
00:20:04,318 --> 00:20:23,468
 Primary, secondary where we have the rosacea and tertiary syphilis, the neurosyphilis which affects the
neurological system and of course the circulatory system.

86
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:31,206
It’s not known that gonorrhea has a primary and a secondary stage.

87
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:58,406
Thuja is the secondary stage of a gonorrhea which is coming through ancestors or it has come due to the fact that the individual himself got gonorrhea,
mistreated and eventually as a secondary stage they develop condylomata.

88
00:20:59,598 --> 00:21:12,639
All kind of condylomata can belong to Thuja because there are many other remedies; Dulc., Caust., Nit-ac., etc.

89
00:21:13,454 --> 00:21:31,953
But mostly when you see in the ancestors or the prehistory gonorrhea and then you see condylomata the remedy will be Thuja 90%.

90
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:40,841
You examine a person and you suspect Thuja.

91
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:43,145
It’s not easy to pin it down.

92
00:21:44,873 --> 00:21:48,057
Then you ask what about your father, is he still alive?

93
00:21:49,049 --> 00:22:05,178
If the father had gonorrhea before conception of the
person the father most probably  has died between 50-60 years old.

94
00:22:06,154 --> 00:22:17,402
You ask him, you got gonorrhea yourself, no,
your father is alive, no, he dies between 50-60.

95
00:22:18,146 --> 00:22:22,099
Usually you are right. From heart disease?

96
00:22:22,554 --> 00:22:44,170
Yes. In the prehistory of these people you see the father, usually, has dies from a heart attack at the age 55-62.

97
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:50,594
Quite young. Heart attack which is final.

98
00:22:53,371 --> 00:23:02,443
The heart attacks which are final that means nobody can save them is about 25% of the cases.

99
00:23:06,338 --> 00:23:08,802
The rest of the cases can be saved.

100
00:23:09,402 --> 00:23:15,138
Those who die usually there is a prehistory of gonorrhea.

101
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:21,554
So gonorrhea has made the heart quite sensitive.

102
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:44,546
When they give this miasm to the children the possibility is Med. and the second possibility in Thuja
especially if they have growths, warts, condylomata etc.

103
00:23:47,315 --> 00:23:58,491
Thuja will be indicated very frequently in cases where the patient
 says a lot of condylomata were suppressed, cauterized, etc.

104
00:23:59,802 --> 00:24:10,730
There is a metaphysical phenomenon almost transcendental,
 I don’t understand but it true.

105
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:14,434
Because I have checked it again and again.

106
00:24:15,634 --> 00:24:27,917
Many people who have come with these warts, I ask them where are the warts,
they are gone, how are they gone, many times they have given a story

107
00:24:28,637 --> 00:24:42,717
that they told me to through them in the night when then moon is full to
throw them to the moon, and what happens, next day I did not have them.

108
00:24:43,597 --> 00:25:07,941
Then one time a builder he said to me they told me to throw them in the sewers.

109
00:25:08,685 --> 00:25:15,381
So I passing where the water fall down and I throw them there and the next day they disappeared.

110
00:25:17,341 --> 00:25:19,045
You don’t know.

111
00:25:19,445 --> 00:25:22,173
Who heard about that?

112
00:25:23,293 --> 00:25:27,245
Mark Twain!

113
00:25:30,326 --> 00:25:35,397
I can swear I have heard this story again and again.

114
00:25:36,317 --> 00:25:38,494
It must be true.

115
00:25:39,749 --> 00:25:44,637
What happens with it, if it is suppression or not I haven’t still understood.

116
00:25:49,446 --> 00:26:04,550
Usually they take the children to the prayers and they pray but I don’t know how suddenly disappears.

117
00:26:11,405 --> 00:26:15,237
– In Ireland they buy the warts.

118
00:26:15,965 --> 00:26:28,157
A relative buys the warts of somebody and I know a friend of mine who had this and the mother gave 1 penny and the warts disappeared overnight.

119
00:26:29,461 --> 00:26:38,310
But this girl had constitutional homeopathic treatment and the wart came back and she felt better and she got a dose of Thuja too.

120
00:26:42,998 --> 00:26:48,349
– I want you to hear some other people with the experience.

121
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:59,078
In Portugal they offer olive oil with corn cobs and 3 days later it’s gone.

122
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,861
– They put olive oil?

123
00:27:02,541 --> 00:27:13,605
– On corn they get from the field and they make it as an offering, they pray and then 3 days later it’s gone.

124
00:27:20,845 --> 00:27:23,749
– It’s very interesting with this phenomenon.

125
00:27:26,317 --> 00:27:32,306
– You make a circle around the wart and the next day is gone.

126
00:27:32,331 --> 00:27:38,093
 – You have the experience or you heard it?

127
00:27:38,789 --> 00:27:43,954
– I heard it from several people. But it only works with a special kind of pen.

128
00:27:55,067 --> 00:28:04,643
– You have to put the mucus of a frog on the warts and then it’s gone.

129
00:28:06,442 --> 00:28:13,649
– Most probably of conditions amenable to self-suggestion.

130
00:28:16,202 --> 00:28:22,802
That means once people believe this is going to happen, it happens.

131
00:28:23,514 --> 00:28:26,731
– I had in my practice a few cases.

132
00:28:28,235 --> 00:28:39,739
In 3 I made a contract that they are really giving it to me and I bought them and disappeared in 1 week.

133
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:54,388
I did them a self-hypnosis or self-suggestion and I told them to go into relaxation and then it disappeared.

134
00:28:57,204 --> 00:29:00,275
– So self-suggestion is very important.

135
00:29:01,971 --> 00:29:07,851
– But it seems to work only in warts on the hands; it doesn’t work with warts on the foot sole.

136
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:14,698
– That is another good observation!

137
00:29:16,011 --> 00:29:19,235
– Tell me you experience.

138
00:29:20,027 --> 00:29:40,934
– There is a notion in our country if you have a wart especially in children
that if you tie your own hair around the wart and then a few days or weeks later it will be gone. But I did not see any cure.

139
00:29:42,734 --> 00:29:44,430
– But you heard that.

140
00:29:55,308 --> 00:30:13,743
– I had a patient and he a lot of condylomata on his penis, it really looked horrible like a cauliflower
and he could not show it to any woman anymore and first he went to a surgeon and they were cut and

141
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:30,596
cauterized and they multiplied and then he went in laser therapy but it was very painful and then again
they multiplied and become more and more and through homeopathy they went away and he is thankful.

142
00:30:31,892 --> 00:30:35,724
– Was Thuja one of the remedies you gave?

143
00:30:36,099 --> 00:30:38,859
– I don’t remember if it was Thuja or Nit-ac.

144
00:30:47,284 --> 00:31:07,900
– We have to take into consideration these facts because what we call placebo effect is always there in what I call minor things of course.

145
00:31:08,772 --> 00:31:32,708
You have serious condition, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, collagen diseases, you try to cure them with placebo… forget it.

146
00:31:33,819 --> 00:31:40,531
If you have psychopathic problems placebo, forget it.

147
00:31:42,644 --> 00:31:52,027
If you have little anxiety this can be amenable to placebo effect.

148
00:31:54,243 --> 00:32:15,507
I do not know that is the connection between Thuja and placebo effect because it’s very difficult to persuade a Thuja case or to affect a Thuja person by just talking.

149
00:32:16,212 --> 00:32:36,372
They don’t trust, they don’t pay attention, they don’t believe, they doubt there are always second thoughts; this is the type of individual that you will meet in such a case.

150
00:32:43,075 --> 00:32:51,539
Do you remember the case the AIDS case in London?

151
00:32:53,172 --> 00:32:57,331
We have to show this case perhaps. It is a very interesting case of Thuja.

152
00:33:02,483 --> 00:33:05,435
He had AIDS. He was a homosexual.

153
00:33:06,012 --> 00:33:34,580
He had AIDS in a quite progressed stage and I said you have to be careful after I treat you because if I treat you cannot get any more gonorrhea but if I treat your AIDS and you become better you can be infected with gonorrhea.

154
00:33:36,235 --> 00:33:48,964
I told him but he didn’t believe. And he was doing quite well and of course he had contact without protection and he got gonorrhea again.

155
00:33:54,963 --> 00:34:11,931
These people have multiple sexual contacts. I asked him are you steady or not?

156
00:34:12,747 --> 00:34:26,715
Steady. I thought I had found one steady in California and I asked him how many partners he had a year?

157
00:34:28,948 --> 00:34:33,524
He was thinking. I asked 10?

158
00:34:35,268 --> 00:34:46,325
I thought maybe 10 is a big number so I encouraged him to say… No 10 but 8. 20?

159
00:34:47,227 --> 00:34:48,619
He was thinking.

160
00:34:49,203 --> 00:35:01,939
He said about 300. 300 he was considering himself going steady!

161
00:35:02,811 --> 00:35:08,147
I said to him if you are not steady how many?

162
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:12,555
Over 1000 a year!

163
00:35:15,676 --> 00:35:26,748
When I examined deeper to see what is happening they said it is such an excitement!

164
00:35:27,243 --> 00:35:38,288
They have a contact in the morning, in the noon and in the evening they cannot sleep,
they have to go the communal baths and have sex again and then they can sleep.

165
00:35:42,769 --> 00:36:07,528
I was working on a research project Cornel in N.Y. looking in the psychopathology in HIV patients
and my job was to interview the HIV (+) males and one man came in and I asked him about the number of sexual partners he had.

166
00:36:08,048 --> 00:36:18,557
He said, well let’s put it this way I go down to the shop and get the newspaper
and by the time I got home after taking the newspaper I would have sex with maybe 15 or 17 men.

167
00:36:22,149 --> 00:36:29,997
That kind of reports was there.

168
00:36:32,060 --> 00:37:00,812
Back in 1983 when the whole thing came out and I was examining in America some of AIDS people,
very young, very healthy in the beginning and I would ask them how many times they had gonorrhea, maybe 5, how many times syphilis, 3 times.

169
00:37:03,044 --> 00:37:09,788
They said that they had to take antibiotics constantly because we have all these contacts.

170
00:37:10,285 --> 00:37:14,549
We take antibiotics for 2-3 years.

171
00:37:15,628 --> 00:37:25,847
After having syphilis 3 times, 5 times gonorrhea and antibiotics then the immune system was totally gone.

172
00:37:26,358 --> 00:38:03,470
Kaposi sarcoma, Pneumocystis carinii, end stages, not the AIDS related lymphadenopathy, we have total destruction of the immune system and that’s when I wrote
A New Model for Health and Disease I have my ideas during that time which I’ve inserted in that book.

173
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:22,110
Because this book was written back in 1985-1986 and my ideas came from talking with such people and what was happening, how it was spreading.

174
00:38:26,813 --> 00:38:45,213
And since that time I have predicted almost the spread of AIDS within the black people. Because of a gene, most probably which they have.

175
00:38:47,981 --> 00:38:52,589
They’re predisposed to the virus.

176
00:38:53,502 --> 00:39:04,931
Be careful, I know! You know that you are in danger?

177
00:39:06,835 --> 00:39:08,403
You’re celibate!

178
00:39:09,131 --> 00:39:11,378
That’s the best!

179
00:39:20,819 --> 00:39:45,891
It’s very interesting when we speak about Thuja and how many of such young individual needed that remedy where what it matters is not with whom I have this
very intimate contact, is whether I will have the pleasure.

180
00:39:47,946 --> 00:40:00,435
So Thuja individual has actually become a product of our times and our civilization.

181
00:40:02,835 --> 00:40:22,755
They don’t care about contact. Like we spoke Ign. they need emotional contact.
Thuja doesn’t need, it’s just pleasure, just myself. If I get pleasure I can forget you!

182
00:40:26,843 --> 00:40:37,820
It’s very bad. It’s not always that a Thuja is affected in mental emotional level.

183
00:40:38,531 --> 00:40:43,874
Because if you see a lot of growths as I said the mental emotional level is intact.

184
00:40:44,859 --> 00:41:01,763
You can see individual with a lot of emotions, giving but the body is in big danger. You will see the growth.

185
00:41:02,475 --> 00:41:03,675
They are going for cancer.

186
00:41:04,803 --> 00:41:09,794
They are heading to cancer, growths in the physical body.

187
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:39,801
I was just wondering if someone gets rid of his warts by some of these mystery stories we heard in your experience is that a suppression
or it doesn’t do anything when the warts disappear through throwing them away or selling them?

188
00:41:40,985 --> 00:41:42,489
– I cannot say, this is what I said before.

189
00:41:43,386 --> 00:41:48,353
I was not able to establish whether it was suppression or not.

190
00:41:48,857 --> 00:41:54,608
People were coming telling me I have this and
that and I had warts they are gone.

191
00:41:55,449 --> 00:42:04,314
 I could not relate the symptoms they tell me know are
related to the time when the warts were gone.

192
00:42:07,641 --> 00:42:14,376
– George, is the pathology of Thuja in emotional organs?

193
00:42:15,617 --> 00:42:18,673
What is the pathology of Thuja?

194
00:42:19,498 --> 00:42:41,473
It can be from hardness, a hard individual who will hide
his hardness to becoming a psychotic person with different ideas.

195
00:42:46,256 --> 00:42:49,648
Some people think I am the queen of England.

196
00:42:51,681 --> 00:43:07,185
They have a fixed idea. In your mental asylums you will find some of them who believe they are corn.

197
00:43:07,737 --> 00:43:10,465
You know the story.

198
00:43:14,681 --> 00:43:31,881
Where the chicken eat the corn, manger.

199
00:43:32,937 --> 00:43:37,337
He thinks he is a corn and the chicken will eat him.

200
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:45,314
They put him inside of course. I don’t know if it is true.

201
00:43:51,041 --> 00:44:01,993
Psychotherapy again and again, giving medicine so finally they re-examine, are you corn?

202
00:44:02,553 --> 00:44:04,593
No.

203
00:44:14,892 --> 00:44:25,821
They give him the paper, take him out of the asylum and next day he comes in a very anxious state.

204
00:44:26,732 --> 00:44:37,037
He says to the doctor, I know I am not a corn but do the chicken know?

205
00:44:45,044 --> 00:44:50,204
That kind of craziness…

206
00:45:11,428 --> 00:45:40,940
Secretive and the nails usually are brittle.
Perspiration oily, we said that.

207
00:45:43,916 --> 00:46:03,004
There is a very interesting keynote if you find it; when they go for stool the nose runs watery mucus.

208
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:13,108
They consider it as a habit.

209
00:46:13,644 --> 00:46:21,932
Usually they don’t say unless you suspect and ask them.

210
00:46:23,851 --> 00:46:31,227
He may tell you every time I go to stool I have to wipe my nose because the nose’s running with watery mucus.

211
00:46:35,252 --> 00:46:43,003
And another characteristic is that the urination is forked.

212
00:46:52,036 --> 00:46:58,595
You have to be careful because this can happen for the wrong reasons.

213
00:47:00,612 --> 00:47:20,196
In Thuja usually it happens to people who had gonorrhea before and now they have what is called non-specific-urethritis.

214
00:47:21,132 --> 00:47:32,933
This is a secondary stage of gonorrhea.
Condylomata and non-specific-urethritis are secondary stages of gonorrhea.

215
00:47:33,245 --> 00:47:54,925
The discharge in Thuja is quite sticky and the discharge sticks together
the penis and then the urination is forked.

216
00:47:58,412 --> 00:48:13,996
It is actually a chronic discharge which is called morning drop, a Greek expression.

217
00:48:14,796 --> 00:48:26,532
These people after they have gonorrhea mistreated every day in the day they little discharge.

218
00:48:27,092 --> 00:48:37,397
This discharge can get very dry and sticks together in the exit of the penis and the urination is forked.

219
00:48:42,332 --> 00:48:52,131
Sometimes there is hair that may be going there… Jews don’t have this kind of problem!

220
00:48:54,460 --> 00:49:14,052
You have eliminated that problem but for all others there are many possibilities.
Thuja must be a kind of very sticky, dry discharge.

221
00:49:16,844 --> 00:49:45,796
One more characteristic, this is quite good information because it is given easily;
when they are sleeping at a certain moment they see a dream that they are falling and they wake up.

222
00:49:46,836 --> 00:50:04,732
Dreams of falling from high place. It’s very characteristic.

223
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:18,292
In which position do they sleep? Do they have a certain position?

224
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:43,121
–No, I don’t remember a certain position for them.
If you remember these you will spot most probably most of you Thuja cases.

225
00:50:45,530 --> 00:51:05,906
But you have to remember everything I said, not half of it.
Questions?

226
00:51:08,898 --> 00:51:16,857
You mentioned something about they can head towards insanity.
Is there a fear of insanity here with them?

227
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:23,962
– They might have fear of insanity but they are not fearful individuals.

228
00:51:24,922 --> 00:51:38,250
In general they are individuals who are anxious, depressed but not fearful.

229
00:51:39,186 --> 00:51:49,402
You will seldom see fears as primary problem with Thuja.

230
00:51:59,754 --> 00:52:06,594
The feelings of worthlessness must be in what way?

231
00:52:10,361 --> 00:52:22,802
– In social matters and in professional they may not take a big position.

232
00:52:23,417 --> 00:52:29,201
They feel they are of an inferior type.

233
00:52:29,682 --> 00:52:44,594
There’s no real lack of self-confidence but they have not a high idea about themselves.

234
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:52,602
In general they are not individuals with aspiration, vision.

235
00:52:53,442 --> 00:52:55,498
They are down to earth.

236
00:53:07,722 --> 00:53:21,106
There is no excitement in that respect and therefore their idea about themselves is quite low.

237
00:53:25,522 --> 00:53:32,474
What we really believe of ourselves comes of what we are really doing, not what others think…

238
00:53:32,961 --> 00:53:48,575
George is very good, no, what I think about myself is very important and if I do things which are wrong
and have better idea about myself they know it, they are sneaky, secretive.

239
00:53:51,287 --> 00:53:59,110
With a woman, I’ll manage to take her to bed, that’s it now.

240
00:54:05,799 --> 00:54:22,135
It’s not like Anac. Or Bar-c. which don’t believe in themselves at all and have total lack of self-confidence.

241
00:54:23,303 --> 00:54:44,295
I have seen Anac. in a very nice medical doctor working in a laboratory,
knowing his job very well and he said every time I try to go the laboratory I tremble how I am going to do the examinations.

242
00:54:44,815 --> 00:54:46,967
I feel I don’t know anything!

243
00:54:49,631 --> 00:54:52,711
That’s the pathology.

244
00:54:53,495 --> 00:55:04,776
Here it is maybe overstressed a little bit.
Low self-esteem is the right word here.

245
00:55:05,999 --> 00:55:13,398
It’s a bad conscience but not in a conscious level.

246
00:55:15,551 --> 00:55:23,703
They say ok I cheated somebody, I’m clever. I cheat somebody else, I’, clever.

247
00:55:33,463 --> 00:55:43,791
George, can I just ask about the idea of guilt is that connected with that lack of self-esteem?

248
00:55:45,015 --> 00:55:56,813
– Yes. Because they know they have done wrong
things. It’s not something untrue.

249
00:55:59,261 --> 00:56:16,637
If you are hard you make things that transgress,
go beyond the moral and you don’t really care.

250
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:35,901
There is hardness. I have to survive, I have to do this,
this is the idea behind and then of course there is time when they feel guilt.

251
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:49,880
This idea on the paper; as if a strange person is by his side, is that a common delusion?

252
00:56:52,088 --> 00:56:55,703
– It is in the books, I can’t remember now.

253
00:56:58,727 --> 00:57:17,047
What I have seen is… animal living in abdomen.

254
00:57:17,736 --> 00:57:29,287
This is true. Something alive is in the abdomen, like Croc.
Influence of a superior power, as if body is fragile/made of glass.

255
00:57:30,231 --> 00:57:40,776
This is also typical.
Something alive in the abdomen and body made of glass and can break.

256
00:57:41,472 --> 00:57:52,129
The idea is not only his body is made of glass but they have to say I fear it may break.

257
00:57:53,042 --> 00:58:02,394
That’s the whole symptom.
Body and soul separated; I have not seen.

258
00:58:04,289 --> 00:58:27,041
But M.M. is not what I have seen because I haven’t seen all the M.M., I would be a superman!
I put some of this information which comes from the books.

259
00:58:29,225 --> 00:58:33,205
George did you see Thuja more in men in women?

260
00:58:33,589 --> 00:58:46,629
– Yes, more in men and it’s interesting
that Thuja woman is menish, like a man.

261
00:58:54,438 --> 00:59:00,749
Can be quite hard. A woman who
has testosterone quite a lot.

262
00:59:13,134 --> 00:59:19,037
Make a comment. I like to you hear your comments.

263
00:59:19,781 --> 00:59:40,077
This is about body being made of glass… I read somewhere Thuja patient as child was constantly told you are of no use, hopeless,

264
00:59:40,661 --> 01:00:05,141
nothing and therefore he/she wants to be loved by peers or parents and puts on a persona which in the later stages
starts to believe in but deep down in the subconscious he know he is not what he projects out and therefore it comes like ok

265
01:00:05,702 --> 01:00:19,910
I am not who I am therefore if somebody finds out I will break and has this idea
that my body is made of glass because glass breaks so fast.

266
01:00:20,701 --> 01:00:39,837
– More or less this is the idea. They fear they may break down and the real thing will come out.
They have guilt because they are doing these things.

267
01:00:40,814 --> 01:00:52,782
They put a persona or whatever but they have guilt and if the glass breaks,
symbolically, then everybody is going to see the real thing.

268
01:00:57,267 --> 01:01:07,658
What we like to hear is exact expression otherwise the projection may lead us ashtray.

269
01:01:08,898 --> 01:01:14,042
– Can we use Thuja for the aftereffects of vaccination?

270
01:01:15,282 --> 01:01:25,402
– In general, no.
Side effects of smallpox vaccination only.

271
01:01:26,842 --> 01:01:36,699
The idea of smallpox is similar to Thuja.
For instance, you’ll see if we have a breakout of smallpox Thuja would do quite a lot of job.

272
01:01:37,499 --> 01:02:03,594
Because it breaks down in many volcanoes.
You have to go to the ideas behind the symptoms. Growths. Many times malignant.

273
01:02:10,339 --> 01:02:15,740
– George I have 3 patients who did not tolerate the smallpox vaccination.

274
01:02:17,013 --> 01:02:23,845
They got high fever and very bad reaction and they developed Thuja symptoms and Thuja helped them.

275
01:02:24,589 --> 01:02:39,765
But I have not seen it antidoting the triple vaccination, hepatitis vaccination.
I have not seen Thuja acting in such cases.

276
01:02:42,004 --> 01:02:59,845
Smallpox is considered eliminated by the WHO,
WHO thinks it’s abolished from the planet which is not true.

277
01:03:00,548 --> 01:03:11,237
It’s going to come back because these things come in waves and we are not healthy enough to get smallpox.

278
01:03:14,045 --> 01:03:21,204
That’s all. If the population was healthy enough we would have a breakout of smallpox.

279
01:03:22,228 --> 01:03:34,717
But it will come in India, Africa, South America even though population is vaccinated.

280
01:03:35,484 --> 01:03:46,981
When I was in India studying, there was an experiment going on.
One town was vaccinated for smallpox and the other was not.

281
01:03:48,061 --> 01:04:16,941
The epidemic came and the victims were equal. I don’t know.
Vaccination is a serious matter and has to be dealt seriously by the medical establishment.

282
01:04:17,756 --> 01:04:31,900
They have to pay much more attention; they are doing something which is a massive destruction without understanding.

283
01:04:33,516 --> 01:04:45,900
They think they are protecting people but actually they are taking joy away from people,
making them depressed, anxious and sick.

284
01:05:02,886 --> 01:05:07,486
– In the sheet it is written that perspiration has sweets smell.

285
01:05:11,255 --> 01:05:20,423
Oily also. Face is oily and greasy.

286
01:05:21,494 --> 01:05:25,910
– How we can differentiate it is sweet smelling?

287
01:05:28,903 --> 01:05:35,134
– The patient will say it because he has been told.

288
01:05:36,447 --> 01:05:40,734
He himself is going to tell you. You are not going to smell!

289
01:05:54,231 --> 01:06:02,047
The moment the patient tells you he has sweetish smell the idea of Thuja comes to mind.

290
01:06:03,279 --> 01:06:26,287
Then you start investigating about different things; warts, condylomata,
gonorrhea, onions and eventually you can to the conclusion whether it is this or that remedy.

291
01:06:28,958 --> 01:06:56,799
In cases you will see that I am investigating in a different way than theoretically
because in theory we say we must be totally blank and let the patient talk and give all the information.

292
01:06:57,807 --> 01:07:11,007
 If we do that it will take 4 hours and
finally you will have only a confused case, so many symptoms and contradictory.

293
01:07:19,111 --> 01:07:38,094
When I had the Center in Athens there were 30 medical doctors, was one pediatrician doing this;
at least 3 hours for every case and then she brought the case to me to prescribe.

294
01:07:38,750 --> 01:07:42,782
It was impossible! There were so many things.

295
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:52,527
The gist of picture was not there.
You could give any remedy!

296
01:07:54,167 --> 01:08:05,639
If you know M.M. and have the assistance of the repertory your mind goes there.

297
01:08:06,254 --> 01:08:23,174
You investigate this area, then no, you give up this area, there is another hint,
you go and investigate another area and this is the reason why many times students will say what about this remedy.

298
01:08:24,343 --> 01:08:30,734
And I thought this remedy never crossed my mind, because of this reason.

299
01:08:32,886 --> 01:08:49,510
Any case can be Thuja because if you see Thuja symptomatology it’s about 5000 symptoms
so everybody will have some of these symptoms but has not any of these symptoms.

300
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:59,904
Therefore for me is out.
It has to have the characteristics.
