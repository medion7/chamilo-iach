1
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:42,439
I have to say a few things concerning the idea.

2
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,219
I have seen some homeopaths accusing others with their remedy.

3
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:19,049
If they know that this is the remedy they have taken, they accuse the person and say, ah yes Hyos. or Plat.!

4
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,359
Man giving information, she is Plat.

5
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:44,480
Like Hyos. is a difficult situation psychologically.

6
00:01:44,481 --> 00:02:01,550
They are really obsessive, jealous.
 They don't trust anybody.

7
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:13,919
They feel that everybody, most probably is plotting against them or maybe they try to poison them.

8
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:24,209
This is the turn which takes the Hyos. mentality.

9
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:44,639
It has to do a lot with the sexual instinct and you can say that is one of these remedies which are perverted sexually.

10
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:18,219
The perversion will take a turn where the person  has to talk about things which are disgusting.

11
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:39,640
For instance they'll talk about stool, urine, they will talk about it and also people who are...

12
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:48,239
...not in an asylum. They are quite all right.

13
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:58,759
They would like to deal with the stool. They have a stool and then they touch it and they play with the stool.

14
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:14,479
I have this experience which I have seen in a patient. It is terrible, very disgusting habit.

15
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,150
They can have very disgusting habits in many cases.

16
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:32,309
Another case I have seen is just taking
stuff from wounds and eat them.

17
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:56,079
But they also like to talk about these things, about sex, about sexual things and stools and urine.

18
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:08,369
A woman, for instance, if she goes to the bathroom to have stool, she closes the door, this is natural.

19
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:21,359
For a Hyos. it's different. She will leave the door open on purpose that the man will look at her.

20
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:28,519
All this idea. Playing with the stool etc.

21
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,839
This is what I call obsession.

22
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:55,599
There is something inside them which makes them do things obsessively, counting or doing like this.

23
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:11,999
They are upset and then you see....
and then they have an epileptic fit.

24
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:26,449
-Which other remedies are counting?
I didn't find it anywhere.

25
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:42,939
-One of them is this. Or they count objects.
 1,2,3 curtains.

26
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:07,639
Can you understand the obsession when
 they touch the stool and they mix the stool.

27
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:22,639
It's a state of madness almost but they
are not crazy. They are living in the society.

28
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,879
I remember a case when I was in India.

29
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:35,520
Also they are exhibitionists.

30
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:45,439
They will open, the men especially,
 and expose the genitals publically.

31
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:00,929
I remember a case when I was in India, one of our teachers in the school, he was a very old man

32
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:12,110
with a lot of experience and he was telling about Hyos. He had a mental case he was treating, without success.

33
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:28,219
 He said, one day in Calcutta the man got up into a high wall he climbed there and waited for the doctor

34
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,520
to pass underneath.

35
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:46,200
And while the doctor was passing, he urinated.

36
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:56,950
He saw him and he said, 'oh I know your remedy'.

37
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:09,439
He said, I gave him Hyos. and finally I got him better. He was trying to cure him with different other remedies

38
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:17,439
it was not possible. The little ones are
 going out... It's too much.

39
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,969
That's why I don't allow little ones here in the class.

40
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:47,959
Why do they take it out? In a case where you will see real insanity, they will expose constantly this.

41
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:55,469
They feel as if they cannot have something on the skin.

42
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:14,520
You take the case of a Hyos. woman. She is sitting there, you sit here and you know some women they sit

43
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:19,999
  relaxed, let us say.

44
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,739
In which case they can expose a little bit more than necessary.

45
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:35,999
Now the Hyos. woman she will sit there and it's very warm and she will pick up.. and ...

46
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:53,179
As if nothing happens. What's the difference? It's very hot.

47
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:03,909
I'm talking from experience.

48
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:27,460
There's a word in Greek? It's not naivety.

49
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:49,689
It's as if nothing happens and then continues to talk to you about her headache, about this, about that.

50
00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:01,440
No emotions. No shame.

51
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:18,889
 Also there is a tendency, even the
children, they hold their genitalia.

52
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:27,959
They sleep and they hold their genitalia. They put their hands inside all the time and hold their genitalia.

53
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:53,279
Plays with his genitalia, lies in bed with the
 hands between thighs, touching its genitalia.

54
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:03,949
'The symptoms you describe', she says, 'makes me think of children 2,3 years old where they do like this

55
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,980
 or they expose their genitalia'.

56
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:19,009
No, this is not Hyos.  Hyos. is when the urge is there to expose the person, without shame.

57
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:34,069
It's very interesting that when Hyos. gets into a state of grief, they are withdrawn inside them and there are no emotions.

58
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:47,679
Emotions are like wood. Not steel which become in Aur. Like wood, I have a wood inside.

59
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:59,439
It's not as heavy as Aur. depression. But it is almost no emotions. They can communicate, they can talk

60
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,280
they can say things but they feel nothing.

61
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:12,439
 It is a blockage. Jealousy comes and overtakes them from here.

62
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:21,879
They feel tremendous jealousy and they feel here and then this catches the emotions.

63
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:38,559
I don't know how this happens in anatomy or physiology. I cannot know the physiology of that thing.

64
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:51,659
Why these feelings here of jealousy will cut out the emotions? But this is what happens with Hyos.

65
00:14:51,660 --> 00:15:04,199
They lose the feelings. They lose the idea of life. It's not life anymore.

66
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,219
Whatever happens it doesn't matter.

67
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:20,059
And then in order to stimulate themselves sexually, they have to play with the genitals, to expose

68
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:24,809
 the person and to do all this kind of things.

69
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:43,649
I remember a case in the hospital. I had a severe case. Very severe case where he was in a coma.

70
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:54,869
In the hospital, after an operation for an aortic transplant.

71
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:06,879
I gave him certain remedies, Op., Sulph. and then came out of the coma but not completely.

72
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:17,549
He started having delirium because he was having still fever and he was in a delirium state.

73
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:30,039
He was talking all the time, all the night. The nurse told me that he is constantly talking and he had a high blood pressure.

74
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:44,069
Constantly talking and his face was red. I said, that's a case of Lach. So I prescribed Lach. 200, I think.

75
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:54,649
I went next day and he was almost dead. His blood pressure shoot up much more, he was in a much

76
00:16:54,650 --> 00:17:00,689
 worse state and he was mumbling.

77
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:08,479
The words could be heard the day before.
 When I went the next day....

78
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:22,699
... they had become mumbling but the nurse who was attending all night, she told me that after Lach...

79
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:38,199
He was a nice man, very conservative man, living in a religious family. His wife very religious but the nurse

80
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:53,119
 told me 'after you gave him that remedy, he started swearing', not swearing but talking about prostitutes ...

81
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:10,079
You understand. He started saying words of that type, with prostitutes and what he did or he did not do and all that.

82
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:19,230
Then when I saw him the next day, he was ....

83
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,389
I take the blood pressure, it was very high.

84
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:34,093
I thought he had a brain stroke because the vascular system was very much sclerosed.

85
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,944
Strong arteriosclerosis.

86
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,639
I said, oh my god I made a mistake.
 These mistakes are fatal.

87
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:49,679
The blood pressure was high, it's finished.
He will have a bleeding and it's finished.

88
00:18:50,920 --> 00:19:00,899
But then I noticed he was lying in bed and his hands were in his genitalia. And the information that she gave me

89
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:08,919
about swearing and saying words like this,
 I said my god, Hyos.

90
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:15,399
I gave Hyos. and brought him out of
the coma and that saved him.

91
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:21,679
This man lived another 10 years in very good condition.

92
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:40,840
The idea is that they use swearing words. Which is another remedy which likes to use swear words?

93
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:49,989
Something from A.... Anacardium!

94
00:19:54,980 --> 00:20:06,759
Hyos. swear words which are connected
with sex, with stool, urine, things like that.

95
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:52,599
Fear of water also is there. That means they get in a state of rabies.

96
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,319
Mad dog.

97
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:19,989
Also in cases of acute with high fever, there is a restlessness in the fingers, playing with the fingers

98
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:31,280
playing with the bed clothes, making a lot of movements with their fingers while they're in a state of high fever.

99
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:54,919
Because they are desperate, they come to you to be treated and they feel very bad. Apart from the fact that these people

100
00:21:54,920 --> 00:22:02,919
 may be epileptics, asthmatics, with colitis and all that.

101
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:12,109
And then they need to be treated. If you hit exactly to the point and tell them exactly how they feel

102
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:17,079
and what they do, they will accept.

103
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:25,123
-Are they able to develop any emotional
 contact with other people?

104
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:30,759
When they come? Do they have family?

105
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:41,059
-Yes but they are people who are quite apart, quite isolated.

106
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:54,479
 A typical Hyos. case can't be married but still  there is a distance between men and women very much.

107
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:08,839
She keeps a distance. Also what I have to say further for Hyos. is that even in a child this desire to kill

108
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:15,560
we said it has the desire to kill, I have been described.

109
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:26,370
When the patient sees that you really know
 what you are doing, they confess.

110
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:31,559
 I'll tell you what one woman has confessed to me.

111
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:46,079
She said, 'while we were children and I had my sister, she was younger but I was very jealous of her.'

112
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:27,429
She was sitting in front of the swimming pool, the little one, and she went by and just pushed her.

113
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:44,689
Then the little one ... and then she looked and said , 'I looked but had no feelings. I just pushed her to die'.

114
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:56,270
Then the mother heard the voices and came
 and took the child out of the swimming pool.

115
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:12,589
 This is desire to kill and many times people they have confessed to me, oh yes I have desire to kill!

116
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:28,819
Did you ever try? No. They do not try very frequently, otherwise we have a problem but the desire is there.

117
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:40,489
There are a lot of remedies which have that. Plat. and Hep. has that but for Hyos. is quite strong.

118
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:51,249
-The sexual behavior could it be related to some sexual abuse that they had in the past or some history in the family life?

119
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,900
-I do not know.
