1
00:00:17,644 --> 00:00:26,204
Before I start going further I would
like to hear any kind of questions

2
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:35,284
that you may have, something you did
not understand, so we can go ahead.

3
00:01:07,524 --> 00:01:16,300
-I have several questions regarding the
remedy. One has to do with coffee nullifying

4
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,852
the remedy I'll go with that first and then
I want to ask about tea and other things

5
00:01:22,044 --> 00:01:28,812
that antidote the remedy... For the coffee you
said she took Nat-m. yesterday in the case...

6
00:01:29,868 --> 00:01:39,251
-The case of the journalist. Yes, she used to take
10 coffees a day in order to continue her work.

7
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:45,316
-She said if the
coffee will antidote...

8
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:50,468
-These people, if they continue drinking
coffee, it is not possible to work.

9
00:01:51,877 --> 00:02:01,029
You can forget about it. So she attributed the
amelioration of stopping drinking coffee.

10
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:19,348
That is why I said if you now drink coffee,
then it will antidote the remedy I have given

11
00:02:19,788 --> 00:02:25,492
you and then you will come back to
the exhausting state you were before

12
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:35,956
where you had to drink 10 coffees a day in order
to perform your work to which she did not agree.

13
00:02:40,428 --> 00:02:45,707
It would be interesting. I know what was
going to happen because I have seen it

14
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:54,933
with a lot of patients. The moment
that a patient comes and has a problem

15
00:02:55,804 --> 00:03:00,788
he will stop drinking coffee. He takes
the remedy and he becomes well.

16
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:07,284
So he feels now I am well I can drink
coffee. And the moment they start drinking

17
00:03:07,732 --> 00:03:14,348
coffee, they come back and I asked her
because the remedy has acted very well.

18
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:20,924
So I said what happened and you
relapsed in 6 months or earlier.

19
00:03:22,716 --> 00:03:26,804
Did you drink coffee?
They said yes.

20
00:03:27,796 --> 00:03:33,268
Then I give again and again they drink
coffee and then they relapse again.

21
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:41,521
Perhaps the 3rd time they stop. And
then I see they remain well after that.

22
00:03:41,801 --> 00:03:51,321
This is one circumstance in which I realize
the coffee antidotes the treatment.

23
00:03:52,337 --> 00:03:53,929
There is no question about that.

24
00:03:56,705 --> 00:04:14,969
There is another possibility where after
several relapses because of drinking coffee

25
00:04:16,193 --> 00:04:25,313
and after the person was swearing to me the
last time he will never drink coffee again

26
00:04:26,256 --> 00:04:33,400
because he was relative and I said I will not
give you any more if you keep on drinking coffee.

27
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:46,032
So finally I gave him the last time
and 2 or 3 years later he called me

28
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:56,304
for something else and he said I have
been drinking coffee the last year and

29
00:04:56,688 --> 00:05:03,176
I had no relapse of
the original case.

30
00:05:03,656 --> 00:05:13,592
It was a severe sinusitis
ready to go for operation.

31
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:21,560
So Kali-b. stopped that
entirely and he was quite well.

32
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:28,000
After a few months he started drinking
coffee. 6 months later back the sinusitis.

33
00:05:29,608 --> 00:05:35,906
The 3rd time I told him if you keep on
drinking coffee, I will not give you a remedy anymore.

34
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:41,009
After the 3rd
time he remained well.

35
00:05:41,385 --> 00:05:47,401
A year later he tried drinking coffee
again and it was not a relapse.

36
00:05:47,889 --> 00:06:00,433
But when he called me, maybe 4-5 years
later, he called me because he had

37
00:06:00,785 --> 00:06:15,081
a urinary difficulty...so I said do you also
have vertigo? He says how do you know

38
00:06:15,425 --> 00:06:19,410
I can't believe that you know I
have vertigo, yes I have vertigo!

39
00:06:20,953 --> 00:06:31,993
Take a dose of Conium and for years now,
he is in my age, he is not bothering me.

40
00:06:33,697 --> 00:06:39,265
So you know very well what
happens with drinking coffee.

41
00:06:39,593 --> 00:06:46,065
Drinking coffee sooner or later
will antidote the treatment.

42
00:06:46,578 --> 00:06:54,929
There are some teachers who say
you can drink coffee, no problem.

43
00:06:58,081 --> 00:07:07,233
I said to these teachers have you
ever given the right remedy?

44
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:16,265
Because if you give wrong
remedies, there is no problem.

45
00:07:16,873 --> 00:07:24,048
You can take coffee or whatever you like.
The condition will remain the same more or less.

46
00:07:24,681 --> 00:07:34,971
If you have given a remedy which
affects a little portion of the disease

47
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:42,395
then drinking coffee will have no
difference. They will remain the same.

48
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:50,386
But if you bring back the whole balance
in the organism, the organism becomes

49
00:07:51,091 --> 00:08:00,763
sensitive to any kind of chemical drug.
And caffeine is a chemical drug

50
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:07,891
which stimulates the nervous system and the
continuous stimulation will definitely

51
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:13,443
bring about a relapse.
This is a fact.

52
00:08:14,275 --> 00:08:19,395
George says don't drink coffee, no with
my treatment you can drink coffee.

53
00:08:19,876 --> 00:08:32,757
How is that possible? She had another question
I think, just wait. Tell me the second.

54
00:08:36,868 --> 00:08:39,923
-Tea and chocolate they also...

55
00:08:40,411 --> 00:08:45,747
-Tea also has an amount of
caffeine, as everybody knows.

56
00:08:46,347 --> 00:08:55,316
I don't know why the caffeine in the
tea is not as effective in stimulating

57
00:08:56,076 --> 00:09:03,155
the nervous system as the coffee which
is burned out, which is prepared.

58
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:21,819
Coffee grounds which have been fried. How
the frying had activated the caffeine

59
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:29,851
quality in the coffee, I don't know.
What I know is that if you drink coffee

60
00:09:30,228 --> 00:09:38,155
with caffeine, you will have a relapse
if you have the correct remedy.

61
00:09:39,267 --> 00:09:46,187
With no correct remedy it doesn't
matter you can drink whatever you like.

62
00:09:47,204 --> 00:09:51,883
-Does decaffeinated coffee antidote?
It is Ok to take decaf?

63
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:59,875
-Perhaps it will antidote a few cases
that have sensitivity to the tea.

64
00:10:00,915 --> 00:10:06,730
There are some patients they say if I
drink half a cup of tea I have tremendous

65
00:10:07,203 --> 00:10:12,771
palpitations. These patients you
have to stop them from drinking tea.

66
00:10:13,595 --> 00:10:23,268
Whatever is the chemical that may be
using and have an effect on the organism

67
00:10:23,676 --> 00:10:26,123
and they know it, you
have to stop it.

68
00:10:27,003 --> 00:10:34,003
If some person says I am very sensitive to
vinegar. If I drink vinegar I am destroyed.

69
00:10:34,363 --> 00:10:46,202
You have to stop it. Even simple substances
are causing a tremendous reaction

70
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:52,995
to the organism, you must stop it because
you give the remedy, the organism tries

71
00:10:53,699 --> 00:11:01,771
to bring balance. This takes time.
Takes from a few days to a few months.

72
00:11:03,107 --> 00:11:17,939
In this period of time the organism works
in order to bring about a total balance.

73
00:11:19,275 --> 00:11:26,276
In this process you enter with a stimulant
which is sensitive to the organism

74
00:11:26,947 --> 00:11:29,035
and it is antagonistic.

75
00:11:30,195 --> 00:11:35,403
The one goes towards one direction for
cure and the other goes to the opposite

76
00:11:35,819 --> 00:11:38,444
direction destroying
the organism.

77
00:11:40,003 --> 00:11:52,107
That is why you have to stop all irritants
that may affect the human organism.

78
00:11:58,163 --> 00:12:01,659
-There was this journalist she was
drinking 10 cups of coffee every day and

79
00:12:03,731 --> 00:12:09,762
I observed that people drinking 2 lt of
coffee a day, when they just take it away

80
00:12:10,156 --> 00:12:16,371
they get a lot symptoms
like headaches.

81
00:12:17,051 --> 00:12:24,700
Sometimes I wait before I give the remedy
till these symptoms are less or gone.

82
00:12:26,236 --> 00:12:33,171
But you gave Nat-m. You gave
the remedy for 20 days?

83
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:48,843
-I told her to take a little bit. Here
you have to understand my problem.

84
00:12:49,395 --> 00:12:56,443
She is a scientist, she has come from a
very serious scientific magazine and

85
00:12:56,803 --> 00:13:06,315
I don't want to have problems. She
says let me have an experiment.

86
00:13:06,931 --> 00:13:15,267
But if I give an experiment and cause a
problem to her, she will come out publicly

87
00:13:15,932 --> 00:13:22,939
and say these people are killing people.
She comes out and says I have now suicidal

88
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:30,259
depression so he caused me a trouble.
He knew he could cause me trouble,

89
00:13:31,051 --> 00:13:36,866
I did not know and he still
agreed to give me the remedy.

90
00:13:37,675 --> 00:13:46,075
I was taking a chance by giving Nat-m.
Because she could accuse me for having

91
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:52,835
a lot of symptoms if I was not
exact and it was a close remedy.

92
00:13:53,315 --> 00:13:57,891
If the remedy was not close there was
no problem, would have no effect.

93
00:13:58,427 --> 00:14:05,411
But if it was not close? So I wrote
you would have some headaches etc.

94
00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:13,426
but I did not write you may have suicidal
disposition which she might had.

95
00:14:13,771 --> 00:14:21,067
I did not know because I did not take her
case. Because she says I don't want to

96
00:14:21,603 --> 00:14:27,939
be treated. I want to see whether when
you say there is proving of the remedy

97
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:33,731
if this remedy will give me the
symptoms that you are recording.

98
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:38,155
This is what I want to see.
You see how difficult it was.

99
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:49,707
You have to understand also one thing
that when you talk on these levels

100
00:14:50,283 --> 00:14:56,131
people do not accept nonsense. If you
talk nonsense they will say go to hell...

101
00:14:58,091 --> 00:15:10,075
And it's on my shoulders to try to
prevent what bad things can happen

102
00:15:10,435 --> 00:15:18,587
for Homeopathy and
to save this system.

103
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:27,875
In 1960 when I came into the scenery
when I tried to investigate I saw only

104
00:15:28,251 --> 00:15:38,236
French Homeopathy. And it was a bottle
with 20 remedies for different pathologies

105
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:46,835
and people who would prescribe 10, 15,
20 remedies... That was all that existed

106
00:15:47,163 --> 00:15:52,115
and Homeopathy had a very bad
position in the whole world.

107
00:15:53,467 --> 00:15:59,162
Then I started fighting
and people fought back.

108
00:15:59,547 --> 00:16:10,764
Even now people are fighting back George
is this or that, George is old-fashioned...

109
00:16:15,043 --> 00:16:18,195
I want to see who is
modern-fashioned.

110
00:16:19,587 --> 00:16:27,091
I went through periods where the
homeopathic pharmaceutical industry was

111
00:16:27,499 --> 00:16:30,251
against me very overtly.

112
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:56,907
I remember the director of a French
company asked me for a meeting.

113
00:16:57,435 --> 00:17:04,371
So he calls the director of [company] and
says I'm going to have a meeting with G.V.

114
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:16,259
And I am flying to London to see G.V. He
told me himself, he said don't meet him,

115
00:17:16,571 --> 00:17:25,500
kill him. I don't believe he really meant
it that he should shoot me but that was

116
00:17:25,923 --> 00:17:27,019
the idea behind.

117
00:17:27,811 --> 00:17:40,700
In 1983 I was in congress in Washington
D.C. and both his parents were there.

118
00:17:41,444 --> 00:17:49,035
And one of them said to me doing
like this we should kill you.

119
00:17:51,723 --> 00:17:58,795
I said why? Because if we follow
your system, we will go bankrupt.

120
00:18:01,995 --> 00:18:09,147
Do you realize how serious it was and I
had to manipulate all this situation and

121
00:18:09,579 --> 00:18:21,939
to persuade that it was to their advantage
if I taught and homeopaths were effective

122
00:18:22,243 --> 00:18:27,563
in their treatment because the prestige
of Homeopathy will rise and automatically

123
00:18:28,451 --> 00:18:31,339
their sales will increase.

124
00:18:33,492 --> 00:18:44,437
But all this was taking me a lot of
effort and still people are attacking me...

125
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:59,428
For curing people. Not the allopaths, the
homeopaths I mean. This is the situation.

126
00:19:00,363 --> 00:19:06,635
This stupidity is beyond belief. Because
before everyone who is a homeopath

127
00:19:07,828 --> 00:19:15,756
wanted Homeopathy to have a prestige,
otherwise they will totally exterminate

128
00:19:16,203 --> 00:19:19,051
Homeopathy. They
are very powerful.

129
00:19:19,947 --> 00:19:24,755
They can just wipe us out
if we don't have effect.

130
00:19:27,971 --> 00:19:33,931
And most of the so-called homeopaths
today they don't have an effect.

131
00:19:34,395 --> 00:19:39,803
They just give remedies here
and there without real effect.

132
00:19:40,771 --> 00:19:50,147
They can have some effect, few cases
may be responding but they think...

133
00:19:52,587 --> 00:19:57,379
Some people will say, I don't have to
give the remedy, actually if I think

134
00:19:58,236 --> 00:20:03,523
the correct remedy, the person will
be cured and things like that.

135
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:09,532
I meditate, I don't need to
take the case, take Staph.

136
00:20:11,891 --> 00:20:15,195
And this is supposed
to be Homeopathy.

137
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:26,771
I have to get all the impact. Because
when they call me in Germany in

138
00:20:27,171 --> 00:20:34,963
Bonn Medical School the professors say
come and speak to the medical students.

139
00:20:35,884 --> 00:20:41,843
And from the time they invited me to the
time I was there, they investigated what

140
00:20:42,227 --> 00:20:50,331
Homeopathy is. And they hear that there
are people who prescribe zebra because

141
00:20:51,148 --> 00:21:05,268
if somebody likes blue and white like
her... You must take zebra. Not only that.

142
00:21:06,915 --> 00:21:13,995
So when I arrived, they said wait a
moment before you go to the auditorium to

143
00:21:14,355 --> 00:21:20,571
speak to the students we have to put some
questions. I said yes, what questions?

144
00:21:21,435 --> 00:21:28,139
Two German professors one pathology
[internal medicine] professor and the other

145
00:21:28,524 --> 00:21:36,371
one psychiatry professor. One woman and
one man. Very serious. Not like me.

146
00:21:42,155 --> 00:21:52,803
And said we hear that you give remedies
because people look like an animal...

147
00:21:56,643 --> 00:22:05,883
We hear that you prescribe
this with these indications.

148
00:22:06,235 --> 00:22:14,484
If somebody wears a pair of trousers
with this... They knew more than I knew by

149
00:22:14,779 --> 00:22:23,339
that time of the different nonsense
that was going on all around the world.

150
00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:31,491
And I had to explain to them that I
am against this even more than you.

151
00:22:38,204 --> 00:22:51,204
They seemed to be persuaded. Then fortunately
I had a journal in which I had written

152
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:57,211
my attitude towards this.

153
00:22:58,595 --> 00:23:05,876
It was a European Journal of Homeopathy, I
was publishing that Journal by that time

154
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:13,738
and I brought it to them to read.
And they said come and teach.

155
00:23:15,819 --> 00:23:26,316
But all these, thousands of such things in
order to support the right Homeopathy and

156
00:23:26,691 --> 00:23:31,995
in the meantime some people come around
"I am a teacher", you are a teacher but

157
00:23:32,499 --> 00:23:40,612
what do you teach? It's not a matter
of being a teacher, everybody says

158
00:23:40,979 --> 00:23:45,747
I am a teacher of Homeopathy,
because there are no standards.

159
00:23:46,236 --> 00:23:53,507
What you teach is the main thing and
what is the effect of what you teach?

160
00:23:58,443 --> 00:24:04,379
I call somebody from America to teach
here, I don't want to tell his name.

161
00:24:04,748 --> 00:24:10,443
He comes and the first thing he
says is I don't agree with George.

162
00:24:14,931 --> 00:24:21,531
People come back and say what the truth is.
You brought a teacher who says

163
00:24:21,725 --> 00:24:29,189
I don't agree with George because of
this and that reason and then whom to

164
00:24:29,693 --> 00:24:33,661
believe, yourself or the other
teacher which you brought?

165
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:41,757
I called another teacher, he comes and
says that George says there is an initial

166
00:24:42,134 --> 00:24:45,405
aggravation. I have never
seen an initial aggravation.

167
00:24:47,893 --> 00:24:57,021
George says that there might be a possibility
that old problems they may reappear.

168
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:04,085
I've never seen problems
of the old coming back.

169
00:25:06,981 --> 00:25:18,014
Where is my position?
What should I say to the students?

170
00:25:21,221 --> 00:25:43,403
And then they go back and start fighting...
I don't know if I answered your question.

171
00:25:46,906 --> 00:25:50,594
-I have a question related
to the antidotal influences.

172
00:25:57,003 --> 00:26:02,730
What is your experience with people
who are drinking coke, coca-cola?

173
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:13,099
-It's the same. Coca-cola has less
effect but the coke that contains together

174
00:26:13,563 --> 00:26:19,299
with the caffeine has
a stimulating effect.

175
00:26:19,826 --> 00:26:26,339
Some people drink one glass of Coca-cola
and they cannot sleep the whole night.

176
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:31,936
These people it's dangerous
if they are drink Coca-cola.

177
00:26:39,633 --> 00:26:49,537
Coca-cola definitely to some people
especially if they drink 2-3 glasses a day,

178
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:59,976
sometimes they drink the whole
bottle... then it will antidote.

179
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:08,808
But you may say Ok then we have to live in
a sterilized world. It is not like this.

180
00:27:10,225 --> 00:27:15,585
Because the pollution also if you
are exposed in a lot of pollution...

181
00:27:16,584 --> 00:27:23,320
If you live in the center of Athens or in a
town with a lot of pollution and you have

182
00:27:23,752 --> 00:27:31,977
a lung problem, you are going to have a
relapse much easier than somebody living

183
00:27:32,441 --> 00:27:38,256
in the island here. That is
true but what else can we do?

184
00:27:39,232 --> 00:27:44,120
Each one has to protect his
own self as much as possible.

185
00:27:57,136 --> 00:28:02,272
-I hear frequently from my patients that
they are swearing that coffee doesn't do

186
00:28:02,649 --> 00:28:10,208
anything with them because I explained them
that everything that has a stimulating

187
00:28:10,585 --> 00:28:14,729
effect is not good. And they swear because
they don't want to give up the coffee,

188
00:28:15,473 --> 00:28:20,552
that is has no effect any coffee.
What is the best argument?

189
00:28:22,018 --> 00:28:33,084
-That is true. There are some people who say
I can drink coffee in the night and then

190
00:28:33,467 --> 00:28:36,067
I can go to bed and
sleep immediately.

191
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:43,683
It is true that coffee has no
sensitivity towards their organism.

192
00:28:47,788 --> 00:28:56,659
Such people that there is no real effect of
the coffee upon their organism before the

193
00:28:57,188 --> 00:29:04,164
treatment, they may continue but we don't
say that in order to protect the patient.

194
00:29:06,524 --> 00:29:19,868
Even if they tell me there is no effect, I
have to doubt because if there was no effect

195
00:29:20,308 --> 00:29:25,044
why they don't want to change
it to tea or something else?

196
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:34,179
There is something that pleases them and
this pleasure maybe is not excessive or

197
00:29:34,532 --> 00:29:43,812
is not lubricating their minds but still might
be some effect. And they cannot stop it.

198
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:50,547
-I also forbid them the coffee because of this,
I say even if you don't feel the effect,

199
00:29:51,036 --> 00:29:57,884
it might have an effect.
-This is also my experience.

200
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:04,867
-The next, what I very frequently hear
George, is that the people who deal with me

201
00:30:05,251 --> 00:30:10,419
ask me for how long I must stop the
coffee... One week, one year, one month...

202
00:30:12,492 --> 00:30:13,796
-That's another question.

203
00:30:14,172 --> 00:30:17,932
-I normally say to them as
long as you have complaints.

204
00:30:21,635 --> 00:30:29,763
-That is true. What I usually say to
them; you have to stop for 3 years.

205
00:30:31,724 --> 00:30:38,139
If they stay well for 3 years and after that
they start drinking coffee and they relapse

206
00:30:38,715 --> 00:30:43,283
and they come to me I say in
your case you needed 5 years.

207
00:30:43,924 --> 00:30:49,900
So next time you stop it for 5 years.
This is the argument.

208
00:30:50,476 --> 00:30:55,155
For how long do I have to stop? Because
some people as soon as they finish

209
00:30:55,587 --> 00:31:01,859
the treatment they start drinking coffee.
I don't take remedies anymore.

210
00:31:04,636 --> 00:31:09,564
-I normally make a compromise with them
and say Ok stop it for 1 month at least

211
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:15,243
and if after drinking coffee you write
down that you drank one at least to have

212
00:31:15,868 --> 00:31:19,372
a proof that the remedy
was spoilt from this.

213
00:31:19,828 --> 00:31:27,972
Sometimes I cannot say for 3 years because
it seems too much challenge for them...

214
00:31:34,611 --> 00:31:52,387
-My experience is that some people who
are kind of bon viveur, rich people...

215
00:31:53,092 --> 00:32:04,308
They say Ok forget George, they drink
coffee and when they relapse they come and

216
00:32:04,683 --> 00:32:13,515
they tell you the remedy has not acted just
for this period of time I was somewhat

217
00:32:13,876 --> 00:32:21,539
better but then I relapsed totally. I
know they have been drinking coffee.

218
00:32:22,923 --> 00:32:28,827
You know how many times people think I read
the minds of the people, it's not that.

219
00:32:29,396 --> 00:32:35,652
It's my observation. I know the psychology
and I understand what each one is doing

220
00:32:36,004 --> 00:32:40,716
and what is thinking etc. I said
Ok you have been drinking coffee?

221
00:32:44,364 --> 00:32:54,533
One time. I said not one time one
time a day. Yes Ok one time a day.

222
00:32:55,540 --> 00:33:03,971
Not one time a day. Sometimes
you drank 2 coffees a day. Ok...

223
00:33:05,452 --> 00:33:10,988
But they come and tell you the remedy did
not act because it acted only for a period

224
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:18,403
of time. They think
they can bluff me.

225
00:33:19,436 --> 00:33:24,028
And there is another group of people
who come and say there was no effect.

226
00:33:27,452 --> 00:33:35,683
What about this and that...? And then they
say this I don't remember I had this.

227
00:33:40,076 --> 00:33:49,900
And I said to them now you have to decide,
you tell me you are totally the same

228
00:33:50,339 --> 00:33:51,771
and I believe you.

229
00:33:52,459 --> 00:33:59,643
But if you are better, the remedy is correct
and I have to continue with the same

230
00:34:00,068 --> 00:34:11,083
remedy and you tell me the remedy had no
effect, I will try to find another remedy

231
00:34:11,612 --> 00:34:20,204
for you. That means I will be searching again
out of 2000 remedies for the next one.

232
00:34:20,548 --> 00:34:27,059
But if that which I gave you was really the
correct one, I will search for 2000 months

233
00:34:27,779 --> 00:34:34,435
every time you come giving you the wrong
remedy because we will have missed

234
00:34:35,116 --> 00:34:42,180
the correct one. So what do you think now?
Are you the same or better?

235
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:48,044
He says Ok don't
give another remedy.

236
00:34:50,916 --> 00:35:01,372
Because you realize it's not the same but
since he is not totally well he thinks he can

237
00:35:01,715 --> 00:35:12,604
tell you a lie and you can believe them
and you will give them a better remedy...

238
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:29,597
There was a question also from another
student here. He says in paragraph 46,

239
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:38,691
there is place about vaccination.
Could you explain this?

240
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:54,908
Hahnemann says about positive
effect of vaccination, does he?

241
00:35:56,684 --> 00:36:04,821
In paragraph 46, he does not say about
vaccination. Later on he will talk about it.

242
00:36:12,027 --> 00:36:21,307
But what has been misunderstood about
vaccination and Hahnemann is this.

243
00:36:22,308 --> 00:36:32,964
That Hahnemann was treating epidemics
during his time that were very much

244
00:36:35,788 --> 00:36:46,028
in action, the children epidemics, and he
had found out that if he knew the genius

245
00:36:46,531 --> 00:36:55,427
of the epidemic, he treats 1,2,3,4 people
and out of 4 people three needed Bell.

246
00:36:56,196 --> 00:37:00,803
And then he treats some more
and out of 10, 7 needed Bell.

247
00:37:01,212 --> 00:37:11,292
The genius for this epidemic is Bell. So
he gave Bell. to many other people and

248
00:37:11,692 --> 00:37:22,892
he found out that there was a
minimizing of the epidemic.

249
00:37:25,388 --> 00:37:32,508
The people who took the Bell. were a
small percentage of the other population

250
00:37:32,948 --> 00:37:44,452
that fell sick. And he said that this is a
preventing medicine, a homeoprophylaxis,

251
00:37:44,844 --> 00:37:51,924
they called it later on and they
made a big thing out of that.

252
00:37:55,203 --> 00:38:11,924
Some people said we will give you Thuja,
so you are protected from smallpox.

253
00:38:14,587 --> 00:38:25,100
We'll give you another remedy and
you are protected from chickenpox.

254
00:38:25,852 --> 00:38:30,347
We'll give you another to protect
you from whooping cough.

255
00:38:32,291 --> 00:38:42,604
Without the epidemic I will give you now,
there is no epidemic, and this-what I gave

256
00:38:42,924 --> 00:38:47,243
you-will protect you when the epidemic
comes, don't worry, you will not get it.

257
00:38:48,355 --> 00:38:55,212
That is totally wrong. Why?

258
00:38:56,516 --> 00:39:12,568
Because the potentized remedies are acting
once the symptoms are in the person

259
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:24,720
then on the power of the fact that the
symptoms are manifesting, then the action

260
00:39:25,128 --> 00:39:33,200
of the remedy can be curative. Otherwise
you take a remedy which has nothing

261
00:39:33,568 --> 00:39:36,464
to do with your present
symptomatology.

262
00:39:37,448 --> 00:39:46,360
The organism , the most it can do, if
there are proving symptoms after a month

263
00:39:46,816 --> 00:39:51,936
or two I will get rid of that
symptom and return back to normal.

264
00:39:53,680 --> 00:40:05,656
Therefore there is no logical reason for
a remedy that I took two years ago will

265
00:40:06,065 --> 00:40:13,544
protect me now from malaria which
is an epidemic at the moment.

266
00:40:15,608 --> 00:40:27,048
Now what Bell. was doing during the time
of the epidemic ,it was for those people...

267
00:40:27,504 --> 00:40:39,376
If you take Bell. and there is an effect
of the epidemic, scarlet fever, whatever

268
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:49,201
but you keep on taking the Bell. so the
scarlet fever or whatever the epidemic is,

269
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:57,079
as soon as it manifests the first symptoms
you are taking the correct remedy

270
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:06,024
because the genius of the epidemic is Bell.
and reduces the effect and the overall

271
00:41:06,608 --> 00:41:10,911
progress of the disease.

272
00:41:13,161 --> 00:41:20,657
So the action is curative
again, not preventive.

273
00:41:23,176 --> 00:41:31,951
By the time there is the epidemic, you know
the genius epidemicus, you may give it

274
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:42,689
to your friends, population and maybe
some of them will be spared or will go

275
00:41:43,192 --> 00:41:46,991
through the epidemic
in a mild form.

276
00:41:48,048 --> 00:42:01,401
These are the facts. Otherwise we will be
attacked in bluffing people, telling lies to

277
00:42:01,928 --> 00:42:12,824
people and of course the responsibility
which they can accuse us for doing such

278
00:42:13,272 --> 00:42:20,039
a thing is tremendous. Who takes the
responsibility? Shall I tell the people instead

279
00:42:20,528 --> 00:42:26,416
of vaccination give Bell.? To all
the population and will be saved?

280
00:42:27,056 --> 00:42:31,200
Two people will die and
the third one will be me.

281
00:42:36,695 --> 00:42:45,545
So irresponsible ideas of that
type manifest again and again.

282
00:42:49,312 --> 00:42:57,000
Influenzinum i.e. is a remedy that if you
give it during an epidemic it may protect

283
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,449
some people but what happens?

284
00:43:00,835 --> 00:43:10,088
Let's say you give Influenzinum
to your friends or to your group.

285
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:25,040
The thing is today, who is
able to have influenza?

286
00:43:26,008 --> 00:43:38,176
Very few people out of us because we are
sick chronically, we are protected from

287
00:43:38,528 --> 00:43:43,640
having an epidemic by the
fact we are sick enough.

288
00:43:45,384 --> 00:43:56,688
So you cannot attribute the non-effective
of the influenza to the fact you gave

289
00:43:57,032 --> 00:44:03,216
Influenzinum to the people. Sometimes
people ask me for Influenzinum to protect them.

290
00:44:03,704 --> 00:44:10,866
Every year it protects me, please
give me this, I know he is quite sick and

291
00:44:11,202 --> 00:44:14,738
I say you can take it. He
will be protected of course.

292
00:44:18,946 --> 00:44:24,650
But if I treated him and I know the level
of his health, I will not tell him take

293
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:31,769
Influenzinum to protect you because
I will not be sure about it.

294
00:44:32,186 --> 00:44:35,826
But I'm sure if I know
how sick somebody is.

295
00:44:55,658 --> 00:45:01,545
-I would like to say something to the
question you gave before, when you asked

296
00:45:02,002 --> 00:45:07,002
what shall I say to the students if they
hear from one teacher one thing and

297
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:12,682
from me the other thing. I think it's very
easy to remember your first words from

298
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:20,753
the four-year course, you first told us,
you should believe nothing you hear

299
00:45:21,154 --> 00:45:25,994
from me, just listen, go home
and look whether it works.

300
00:45:26,426 --> 00:45:33,562
I can tell you it really works, if you
consequently follow the rules of Homeopathy

301
00:45:34,402 --> 00:45:39,465
and I think the other teachers may be
ameliorating something in their patients,

302
00:45:39,946 --> 00:45:42,522
but they have never
seen a real cure.

303
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:57,057
-Well, she stood first in the examination
on the first examinations we had for

304
00:45:57,426 --> 00:46:02,738
the four-year course ,
because she understands.

305
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:12,075
Once you understand, it's easy to follow but
if you get the knowledge in a superficial

306
00:46:12,426 --> 00:46:24,699
way and you say well, let me try this and that
and then you meet with the first difficult

307
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:36,818
case, what you are going to do to different
other methods? Then you will be lost.

308
00:46:38,002 --> 00:46:46,034
This is for sure. But if you insist, even
if you lose a patient, it doesn't matter.

309
00:46:46,626 --> 00:46:49,782
You say, I cannot treat you,
I cannot find you a remedy.

310
00:46:50,646 --> 00:46:58,919
Like yesterday you saw this example, in front
of you, I said I don't know the remedy.

311
00:46:59,334 --> 00:47:07,861
Do whatever you like, I cannot take up this
case. I lost this case but really I did not

312
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:11,710
because I stay with
my principles.

313
00:47:13,126 --> 00:47:22,478
What I want is that I always tell the
truth and I don't bluff anybody.

314
00:47:24,934 --> 00:47:30,470
This is very important for the
conscience of a homeopath.

315
00:47:31,294 --> 00:47:37,357
Because it is so easy to bluff the patient.
There are people who say crazy things

316
00:47:37,878 --> 00:47:43,534
to the patients and they
believe it and they go and do...

317
00:47:45,566 --> 00:47:58,046
I don't want to mention now but in the
end the patient is totally the same.

318
00:47:58,462 --> 00:48:05,926
There is no difference in their
health and they are desperate.

319
00:48:06,326 --> 00:48:12,181
They go away and say Homeopathy
does not work. He promised me...

320
00:48:18,734 --> 00:48:25,926
Can you imagine that people will
maintain that you don't have to give

321
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:37,726
a potentized remedy. What you have to
do is to write in a piece of paper

322
00:48:38,918 --> 00:48:49,958
Lyc. 10M and put over this paper a glass of
water and this paper will boil the water

323
00:48:50,822 --> 00:48:58,262
and will potentize this water
and it becomes Lyc. 10M.

324
00:48:58,622 --> 00:49:08,206
Then you give it to the patient to drink it.
That is maintained in a public discussion.

325
00:49:10,302 --> 00:49:17,062
People do not get up and say you
are totally out of your mind.

326
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:22,093
What can I say?

327
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:37,559
And then when in England the Minister of
Health wants to extinguish Homeopathy

328
00:49:38,007 --> 00:49:44,942
from the national health
system... what can people say?

329
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:55,583
Can you get up and argue? You have said this.
Can you argue now, you are a charlatan

330
00:49:55,989 --> 00:50:04,822
and should be kicked out from the
NHS if you maintain such things?

331
00:50:05,238 --> 00:50:14,766
Is this correct or not? Unbelievable
things that I have to deal with.

332
00:50:15,302 --> 00:50:20,014
And yet there are
people who believe.

333
00:50:23,838 --> 00:50:27,678
-It's not the Minister of Health
who wants to stop Homeopathy.

334
00:50:30,702 --> 00:50:37,997
It's many other people attacking. It is the
BMA and the reason they're attacking us

335
00:50:38,359 --> 00:50:44,758
is not potentizing 10M by one piece
of paper but our basic principles.

336
00:50:45,238 --> 00:50:54,245
They are attacking things like potency,
Similimum, the foundation of our profession.

337
00:50:54,686 --> 00:51:01,070
It's not just based on nonsense. We
are being attacked for root causes.

338
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:06,374
-I have attended all these process.
What happened with the parliament and

339
00:51:06,821 --> 00:51:11,813
what the arguments were. Who were
the people from who the parliament

340
00:51:12,646 --> 00:51:15,758
maintaining Homeopathy
should be kicked out.

341
00:51:16,638 --> 00:51:20,062
I have attended the whole
thing and I have it all...

342
00:51:20,382 --> 00:51:23,382
If you like I can give
you all the data.

343
00:51:24,349 --> 00:51:28,517
But the question for me is
not that, who accuses us.

344
00:51:29,886 --> 00:51:37,870
Of course the medical association will
be very happy to get rid of Homeopathy

345
00:51:38,342 --> 00:51:45,629
Of course the pharmaceutical companies
will have their own people in

346
00:51:46,006 --> 00:51:53,438
the government and they will push them and
go along and kick out but all this is

347
00:51:53,894 --> 00:52:09,110
based on the fact that there is no effect
and that people are bluffed and the NHS

348
00:52:09,574 --> 00:52:16,502
is paying money for nothing, for no effect.
This was the argument.

349
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:20,654
Why should we be spend
money on nonsense?

350
00:52:21,974 --> 00:52:28,686
They can come to me to show me what is
nonsense when they bring me 10 cases

351
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:41,590
and I ask them how much you spend in
your life for your health and how much

352
00:52:41,982 --> 00:52:47,886
you would spend now that I will treat you
and find out. They don't come to me.

353
00:52:49,590 --> 00:52:58,734
And they maintain with the arguments
which have been promoted by such people

354
00:52:59,262 --> 00:53:04,638
irresponsible people and they have the
arguments, they say what is going on here?

355
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:12,085
We just spend money for nothing. It
is not a matter of who accuses you.

356
00:53:13,806 --> 00:53:18,832
Because the pharmaceutical industry
has a network that can affect even

357
00:53:19,351 --> 00:53:26,479
the Prime Minister. They have no problem.
If the matter becomes very serious,

358
00:53:27,136 --> 00:53:32,336
it's a matter of money, whether
it is 1 million or 1 billion.

359
00:53:34,514 --> 00:53:44,169
They can do whatever they like but the
basis and the arguments on which they base

360
00:53:44,905 --> 00:53:56,658
their decision to kick out Homeopathy from
NHS is based on what kind of nonsense

361
00:53:57,314 --> 00:54:02,218
we have publicly
said and exposed.

362
00:54:09,186 --> 00:54:15,602
-The real reason why the remedy that is...
when a glass of water is put over a piece

363
00:54:16,545 --> 00:54:21,185
of paper where the remedy is written, the
reason it doesn't work is that the remedy

364
00:54:21,529 --> 00:54:40,073
is written in Latin. If you write it in
Greek, it will work...It's been proven...

365
00:54:58,329 --> 00:55:03,208
-For us perhaps this thing about the piece
of paper or remedies sent with energy

366
00:55:03,704 --> 00:55:08,056
looks like nonsense. But for the other
people what we say about potentization of

367
00:55:08,456 --> 00:55:13,296
remedies and very small quantities,
all this also sounds like nonsense.

368
00:55:13,817 --> 00:55:19,241
So that's the problem. What I think we
should do focus on is to produce evidence

369
00:55:19,584 --> 00:55:24,792
about clinical results. And that's
what would convince people eventually.

370
00:55:25,297 --> 00:55:30,184
And what I also would like to say
about evidence-based medicine,

371
00:55:30,809 --> 00:55:38,104
the whole concept of it isn't actually to
find the exact mechanism something works.

372
00:55:38,816 --> 00:55:46,240
It is about clinical evidence. It is about
clinical trials which show that something

373
00:55:47,097 --> 00:55:52,945
has statistically these results. So we
shouldn't be against evidence-based medicine.

374
00:55:53,313 --> 00:55:57,824
It's not exactly the mechanism in the
laboratory. It's about clinical results.

375
00:55:58,168 --> 00:56:06,208
-You are right. We are not against EBM,
we are in favor but we say EBM should be

376
00:56:06,625 --> 00:56:13,904
based on real cure. I don't think you are
right in saying that's all they mean.

377
00:56:14,552 --> 00:56:20,128
They mean, tell us the mechanism
through which you bring about...

378
00:56:25,585 --> 00:56:30,864
-About EBM. It's very standardized. They
have several categories of evidence from

379
00:56:31,296 --> 00:56:40,545
A to E. I don't remember exactly but it
is like A evidence comes from prospective

380
00:56:40,905 --> 00:56:47,016
trials, B from randomized controlled
that means with placebo, C comes from

381
00:56:47,369 --> 00:56:54,528
a well-known teacher on a subject
and he has results with something...

382
00:56:54,784 --> 00:56:57,112
This is called evidence
categorizing C, not as good as A.

383
00:56:57,585 --> 00:57:01,385
It's very standardized,
with EBM.

384
00:57:02,809 --> 00:57:15,441
-They have standardized but what my
argument is that we can show evidence

385
00:57:16,081 --> 00:57:17,793
in curing people.

386
00:57:18,473 --> 00:57:27,745
But in order to do that, we have before
to agree what is to cure a person.

387
00:57:29,873 --> 00:57:42,385
Therefore a person who is mad and is
treated by Homeopathy and now has a

388
00:57:42,744 --> 00:57:48,136
duodenal ulcer is an
evidence-based cure.

389
00:57:49,177 --> 00:57:59,937
We have to agree that the parameters for
the quality of life are considered as EBM.

390
00:58:02,073 --> 00:58:13,210
We have several papers if you go to
science direct, if you go Pubmed,

391
00:58:13,745 --> 00:58:22,657
you will bring down a lot of research
that shows effect of homeopathic remedies

392
00:58:23,209 --> 00:58:35,737
but this research has been based
on wrong idea of research for us.

393
00:58:38,352 --> 00:58:48,784
In the last gynecology Congress that was
held in Athens, we presented a research

394
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:59,993
which is going on in "Helena", the
gynecology public hospital, in which women

395
00:59:00,433 --> 00:59:09,136
over 40 that have tried all kinds of
different methods could not get pregnant,

396
00:59:10,024 --> 00:59:20,353
through Homeopathy they were so many,
about 70% of them they had an effect,

397
00:59:21,137 --> 00:59:22,609
they became pregnant.

398
00:59:23,209 --> 00:59:34,377
Such a paper is based on 1 to 1 individual.
That means we did not give one remedy

399
00:59:34,793 --> 00:59:42,848
to all of them. They say give one remedy
to all of them and if you have an effect

400
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:45,288
then we will accept it.

401
00:59:45,952 --> 00:59:53,328
Why don't you accept the fact that these
sterile women had the possibility

402
00:59:53,793 --> 00:59:57,993
to become pregnant under
homeopathic treatment?

403
00:59:58,985 --> 01:00:09,105
When you send a paper like that they have
a lot of arguments against such a paper.

404
01:00:09,945 --> 01:00:13,401
Because it is not according
to the standards as you said.

405
01:00:14,313 --> 01:00:20,992
Randomization and all this kind of
standardization which they have imposed.

406
01:00:21,456 --> 01:00:26,120
How can we prove it? What we
can prove is the evidence.

407
01:00:27,977 --> 01:00:36,698
Out of 10, 7 had become pregnant. The
number is small... We need more numbers.

408
01:00:37,352 --> 01:00:47,496
How many do you need? 40. Ok we will do
with 40. Oh yes but... 1,2,3,4,5 parameters

409
01:00:47,897 --> 01:00:52,177
were not correct, they
will always find...

410
01:00:52,656 --> 01:00:57,552
And that is why I mock
with this evidence.

411
01:01:00,361 --> 01:01:14,905
They come afterwards, after a double
blind study has been done, and criticize

412
01:01:15,336 --> 01:01:20,912
the study and they destroy the study
but in the meantime the remedy

413
01:01:21,241 --> 01:01:29,824
which was selected to become the
curative agent has been distributed

414
01:01:30,152 --> 01:01:31,560
all over the world.

415
01:01:32,504 --> 01:01:40,768
But there is a study afterwards that
says the research was not correct,

416
01:01:41,089 --> 01:01:46,056
the people who did the research were
paid from the pharmaceutical industry.

417
01:01:46,464 --> 01:02:08,560
These people... nobody criticizes that.
That is true because you are very good.

418
01:02:10,497 --> 01:02:22,297
She was the first to enter the Medical
School and she stood first in graduating.

419
01:02:23,336 --> 01:02:31,720
She's a genius. She
knows quite a lot.

420
01:02:53,593 --> 01:02:57,992
-I didn't understand two
things about yesterday lesson.

421
01:02:58,808 --> 01:03:06,280
I didn't understand that in a list of
symptoms obtained by a proving of a remedy

422
01:03:06,681 --> 01:03:14,248
in a person, how can we distinguish
primary effect and secondary effect

423
01:03:15,064 --> 01:03:16,320
of the remedy?

424
01:03:17,328 --> 01:03:19,920
-That is a good question. You
don't have to extinguish.

425
01:03:20,457 --> 01:03:28,113
Actually you have to record the primary
as well as the secondary symptoms

426
01:03:28,817 --> 01:03:33,656
from a proving and that becomes
the picture of the remedy.

427
01:03:40,665 --> 01:03:50,025
He says in the primary effect there is, in
Opium i.e., constipation, in the secondary

428
01:03:50,496 --> 01:03:55,504
effect the organism
comes and has diarrhea.

429
01:03:56,041 --> 01:04:01,649
So Opium can be indicated both
in constipation and in diarrhea.

430
01:04:04,928 --> 01:04:12,345
So you have to record all the symptoms
from the very beginning you start a proving,

431
01:04:12,729 --> 01:04:15,745
you have to
record all the symptoms.

432
01:04:16,153 --> 01:04:22,544
Initially you will record primary symptoms
and as you go along you will record

433
01:04:22,881 --> 01:04:24,753
also secondary symptoms.

434
01:04:25,305 --> 01:04:32,649
-Ok. And the other question is I didn't
understand the reason why if a person

435
01:04:33,545 --> 01:04:41,272
ameliorates a bit after a remedy and then
he gets an aggravation we can define him

436
01:04:42,177 --> 01:04:44,889
as incurable. Why?

437
01:04:46,817 --> 01:04:58,178
-This is an observation of the old masters
especially Kent who was really a healer.

438
01:04:58,705 --> 01:05:04,633
He was treating thousands of patients
and had a lot of experience.

439
01:05:10,329 --> 01:05:20,137
He noticed this phenomenon that once you
give a remedy in a deep pathology and

440
01:05:20,497 --> 01:05:29,536
there is amelioration and then
aggravation, you have to be careful.

441
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:35,329
If now you give another remedy and instead
of initial aggravation there is an

442
01:05:35,649 --> 01:05:43,057
amelioration and then a relapse, that
indicates once it happens 2-3 times that

443
01:05:43,513 --> 01:05:50,616
the patient is incurable
according to him.

444
01:05:52,153 --> 01:05:56,769
But he also said something
else to which I do not agree.

445
01:05:57,737 --> 01:06:08,537
That if there is an aggravation, the
aggravation can be so great that maybe

446
01:06:08,961 --> 01:06:19,802
the patient will end up dying. I have
said that not all cases are like this.

447
01:06:20,409 --> 01:06:29,929
There are cases in which there was a long
aggravation, the patient's life was really

448
01:06:30,353 --> 01:06:37,465
in danger, but during that aggravation if
you observe, you can see the next remedy

449
01:06:37,849 --> 01:06:41,280
and then you can give it and
then you reverse the process.

450
01:06:41,665 --> 01:06:49,776
But that very long aggravation like
expected in the case you saw yesterday,

451
01:06:50,552 --> 01:06:59,072
we have to wait 2-3 months and the
child will remain in bed and shouting...

452
01:06:59,664 --> 01:07:06,264
But then eventually the picture of the
next remedy may appear, will appear...

453
01:07:06,824 --> 01:07:13,872
and if you give it, then it starts
the other process of amelioration.

454
01:07:21,104 --> 01:07:24,736
Which Medical School
have you finished?

455
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:35,848
-University of Bologna, Italy...

456
01:07:37,752 --> 01:07:44,385
-Because in Italy there are some very
good Medical Schools and some very...

457
01:07:44,888 --> 01:07:47,304
in the south...

458
01:07:55,088 --> 01:08:00,104
I expected that
from you... I can see.

459
01:08:14,968 --> 01:08:21,058
-I still have some questions about
vaccination. It seems that around the world

460
01:08:21,394 --> 01:08:29,834
according to everybody many diseases have
been eradicated, for example in the USA

461
01:08:30,171 --> 01:08:35,683
we don't see polio, except
from unvaccinated people.

462
01:08:36,058 --> 01:08:41,306
I know you mentioned last time, that
people who are harmed more strongly by

463
01:08:41,802 --> 01:08:46,146
the vaccination are the ones who would
have been most susceptible to that

464
01:08:46,603 --> 01:08:52,306
particular disease. But still if
nobody gets it, it is doing something.

465
01:08:52,642 --> 01:08:54,058
What is it really doing?

466
01:08:55,123 --> 01:08:57,914
-Actually I didn't get the question.
Can you repeat it please?

467
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:07,026
-How do vaccinations work? We understand
they are harmful but they seem to

468
01:09:07,315 --> 01:09:12,122
eliminate these diseases all over
the world. How does it work?

469
01:09:17,186 --> 01:09:24,729
-There are several issues. It's a big subject
to analyze it properly. But I will summarize.

470
01:09:27,274 --> 01:09:39,396
At this moment the western population,
Europe, America, Canada are not candidates

471
01:09:39,835 --> 01:09:50,323
for epidemics. The reason is they
are all very sick chronically.

472
01:09:50,907 --> 01:09:55,210
There is no possibility that
an epidemic can spread.

473
01:09:55,691 --> 01:10:08,307
If by chance there is one or two sporadic
incidents, such sporadic incidents they are

474
01:10:08,722 --> 01:10:15,962
not coming to the forefront and only the
hospitals may know what is going on.

475
01:10:18,043 --> 01:10:24,434
Why this epidemic does not
spread if there is an incident?

476
01:10:25,762 --> 01:10:33,963
The reason is that all the people around
that person who got sick are immune

477
01:10:34,691 --> 01:10:40,138
to such an epidemic because of
their own chronic problems.

478
01:10:40,794 --> 01:10:47,018
So it cannot spread, it cannot go from one
to another because there is no possibility

479
01:10:47,771 --> 01:10:52,299
to get infected.
That's one reason.

480
01:10:53,386 --> 01:11:00,066
The second reason is that
epidemics manifest in waves.

481
01:11:01,010 --> 01:11:16,746
There are periods where TB is raving, killing
lots of people and the wave came down

482
01:11:17,210 --> 01:11:22,914
before the manifestation or the
discovery of the vaccination.

483
01:11:23,682 --> 01:11:26,178
It was coming down according
to the statistics.

484
01:11:26,675 --> 01:11:38,483
So you will see there are natural waves
of epidemics, which after there is a peak

485
01:11:39,155 --> 01:11:44,961
they will go down by themselves
even without any vaccination.

486
01:11:45,596 --> 01:11:55,139
And this we observe in areas where people
can be affected like the Asians and

487
01:11:56,834 --> 01:12:06,249
the South Americans are the people to
which these observations are valid.

488
01:12:07,202 --> 01:12:17,147
There you will see a wave coming, killing
people and then it goes away and doesn't

489
01:12:18,435 --> 01:12:23,842
come back or it comes for 1,2,3
years and the 5th year it is gone.

490
01:12:24,842 --> 01:12:28,874
They are coming back again
after 10 years or 15 years.

491
01:12:35,029 --> 01:12:40,892
If you do not take into consideration all
these factors, you will not be able to draw

492
01:12:41,749 --> 01:12:44,365
conclusions which are correct.

493
01:12:44,853 --> 01:12:59,405
Because you think, smallpox has been
eliminated, is it due to the vaccination?

494
01:13:01,949 --> 01:13:10,486
The argument can be that the vaccination
attributed into the bad health of

495
01:13:10,813 --> 01:13:20,693
the people so they could not, because
of the bad damage done, they could not

496
01:13:21,045 --> 01:13:28,061
anymore get the smallpox or
any other acute disease.

497
01:13:34,077 --> 01:13:43,238
If we really wanted to have the real facts,
we should observe populations like India,

498
01:13:44,277 --> 01:13:50,332
Pakistan, Asian people ... in how
the epidemics behave there.

499
01:13:52,149 --> 01:14:03,235
And we will see that there are times when TB
is coming up or when an epidemic comes up.

500
01:14:04,411 --> 01:14:12,211
In India I have been told, I have not
seen the facts, that in the older times,

501
01:14:16,188 --> 01:14:29,612
before the war , that they left a
city without smallpox vaccination.

502
01:14:29,955 --> 01:14:37,034
In India smallpox was active and
another city was vaccinated.

503
01:14:38,915 --> 01:14:44,771
The epidemic came in both, the city with
vaccination and the city without vaccination.

504
01:14:45,267 --> 01:14:52,850
The number of deaths was similar.
What do you say about that?

505
01:14:54,259 --> 01:15:07,545
I heard while I was in India in the colleges,
I do not have the real facts but if that is true

506
01:15:08,425 --> 01:15:15,896
that is something that we would
have to explore to see really whether

507
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:24,560
in a strong population the vaccination
actually is effective or not.

508
01:15:25,089 --> 01:15:33,145
Because my theory of vaccination is that
the vaccination which is given to a strong

509
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:39,272
organism is rejected, the
effect does not stay.

510
01:15:39,785 --> 01:15:57,825
There is a reaction with an abscess and
the person is not immunized anymore.

511
01:15:58,601 --> 01:16:06,025
He comes back to the original state. That
could explain why the deaths between

512
01:16:06,649 --> 01:16:10,464
the one city and the
other were the same.

513
01:16:11,633 --> 01:16:20,026
Because when the epidemic came, the
people who were vaccinated, most of them

514
01:16:20,513 --> 01:16:25,360
were ready to get it again because they
got rid of the effect of the vaccination.

515
01:16:27,513 --> 01:16:32,397
Why was the same? Because you may say,
the population

516
01:16:33,573 --> 01:16:49,437
that was sensitive to the smallpox,
in the city of vaccination

517
01:16:49,813 --> 01:16:54,765
should have been protected more than the other city.

518
01:16:57,052 --> 01:17:09,510
But what could have happen that those
who were vaccinated

519
01:17:11,174 --> 01:17:20,854
and got rid of the vaccination, 
maybe they were left with a sensitivity to the smallpox.

520
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:33,119
Then they would be easy victims like
an unvaccinated person even worse.

521
01:17:34,926 --> 01:17:44,358
So some of the people of the vaccinated
city became sick because of the vaccination

522
01:17:45,190 --> 01:17:53,104
and could not get it. But the numbers
were the same because the city

523
01:17:53,608 --> 01:17:59,880
which had the vaccination and the people got
rid of the effect of the vaccination

524
01:18:01,296 --> 01:18:07,355
were maintained with an extra
sensitivity to the smallpox.

525
01:18:08,274 --> 01:18:13,578
That is why the deaths were
equal in these two cities.

526
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:20,090
These are arguments that
could be investigated.

527
01:18:22,026 --> 01:18:27,477
They are difficult things to investigate,
I understand, but before we come to conclusions

528
01:18:28,413 --> 01:18:35,069
and say look at the
population, look why at Sabin

529
01:18:35,349 --> 01:18:45,005
what has done for poliomyelitis... It saved
but what is the cost?

530
01:18:48,397 --> 01:19:02,805
Is the cost a similar disease like M.S.
which is expanding like an epidemic today?

531
01:19:03,245 --> 01:19:12,277
Is the cost? Maybe we have to examine
it before we come to conclusions.

532
01:19:13,605 --> 01:19:27,949
Vaccinations have affected and
saved, question mark, in what way?

533
01:19:31,029 --> 01:19:43,653
Genius, what do you say?
You gave up your genius quality?

534
01:19:55,677 --> 01:20:07,421
I'll tell you something. This is not the
idea of reading this and going over.

535
01:20:07,932 --> 01:20:14,788
The idea is really understanding in
depth so you clarify the issues.

536
01:20:15,317 --> 01:20:21,373
So if you are clear, then you can give the
answers when somebody is challenging you.

537
01:20:23,605 --> 01:20:29,324
What Steven has said now is a question
that has been put to me so many times

538
01:20:29,941 --> 01:20:34,637
by so many allopathic doctors.

539
01:20:35,933 --> 01:20:43,660
When you give an answer which is
logical, they stop and think.

540
01:20:46,261 --> 01:20:54,813
But if you say well I don't
know, you leave a black whole.

541
01:21:00,556 --> 01:21:07,265
Somebody who has not spoken yet.

542
01:21:10,585 --> 01:21:15,889
-I have a question which is lying 
in my head, maybe for 3 years,

543
01:21:18,944 --> 01:21:22,792
I sent you an email, can I read it?

544
01:21:25,738 --> 01:21:32,249
This question is concerning how
patient's personality is influenced by

545
01:21:32,617 --> 01:21:45,177
his predispositions? Let us say we have one
clear cut case Level 1 for instance Calc.

546
01:21:47,865 --> 01:21:55,136
The patient produces a very clear picture
of Calc. symptoms and in the state of

547
01:21:55,504 --> 01:22:05,065
a sensitive balance of health, he has some
personal traits which we have connected

548
01:22:05,465 --> 01:22:08,561
with the constitutional
type of Calc.

549
01:22:10,745 --> 01:22:16,795
We can say this is a psoric
patient and is very healthy...

550
01:22:17,475 --> 01:22:20,451
but I have a
hypothetical question.

551
01:22:21,075 --> 01:22:34,571
If this patient before is born,
inherited different complex of predispositions.

552
01:22:35,227 --> 01:22:45,131
For instance sycotic predispositions and
it's logical when the disease will manifest

553
01:22:45,498 --> 01:22:51,410
in these patients the other
remedy (Calc.) will be indicated.

554
01:22:52,043 --> 01:22:59,731
But I absolutely cannot understand in the
state of health of this patient with

555
01:23:00,282 --> 01:23:11,179
sycotic predispositions, why these
predispositions will influence the personality?

556
01:23:12,403 --> 01:23:23,763
-Wait a moment. You made a mistake
thinking that a person is born as Calc.

557
01:23:25,066 --> 01:23:39,674
but you suppose also that this person has
a predisposition for sycotic miasm and

558
01:23:40,082 --> 01:23:44,226
also has a predisposition
for the syphilitic miasm.

559
01:23:46,531 --> 01:23:53,802
There are several things you are asking. I
thought you were asking a logical question

560
01:23:54,754 --> 01:24:05,643
which you'll say if a person is born
as a Calc., then what do we consider

561
01:24:06,371 --> 01:24:13,554
as his symptomatology if
he's in a balanced state?

562
01:24:14,802 --> 01:24:22,590
That means when his pathology will manifest
at what age,

563
01:24:23,318 --> 01:24:29,460
with what provocation if he is balanced.

564
01:24:29,900 --> 01:24:41,372
He's born, he's healthy, he's balanced
and now at the age of 20 he has a stress

565
01:24:42,477 --> 01:24:48,388
and there is a manifestation of Calc.
symptoms.

566
01:24:54,075 --> 01:25:08,036
The traits of his personality how can be
influenced by the fact that he is Calc.?

567
01:25:10,115 --> 01:25:17,265
Further if he has underneath
sycotic miasm and syphilitic miasm

568
01:25:17,905 --> 01:25:21,401
how all this mixture
will end up?

569
01:25:25,442 --> 01:25:29,722
I confused you because you didn't want to
ask this, you were asking something else

570
01:25:30,746 --> 01:25:33,593
which I did not understand
but it doesn't matter.

571
01:25:34,545 --> 01:25:41,970
Now this can be a question to which you can agree
and everyone would like to hear the answer.
