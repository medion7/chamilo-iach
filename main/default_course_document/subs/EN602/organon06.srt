1
00:00:22,418 --> 00:00:33,134
Paragraph 73, "Acute diseases likewise admit of division into several classes.

2
00:00:33,334 --> 00:00:40,057
The first are those which attack single individuals; they are occasioned by hurtful

3
00:00:40,257 --> 00:00:46,220
influences to which the patient happened to be exposed.

4
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:52,891
Excesses in sensual enjoyment, or deprivation of the same; violent physical

5
00:00:53,091 --> 00:01:00,055
impressions; exposure to cold; overheating; excessive muscular exertion; physical or

6
00:01:00,255 --> 00:01:04,905
mental excitement, etc., give rise to acute febrile diseases.

7
00:01:05,105 --> 00:01:11,342
They are, however, in reality but transient aggravations of latent psora,

8
00:01:11,542 --> 00:01:20,055
which returns to its dormant condition of its own accord, provided the acute disease

9
00:01:20,255 --> 00:01:26,216
was not too violent and speedily relieved."

10
00:01:26,416 --> 00:01:41,905
He tries to give an explanation of simple acute diseases, not the epidemics,

11
00:01:42,105 --> 00:01:58,757
the individual diseases. He says these are transient excitations of the predisposition

12
00:01:58,957 --> 00:02:11,324
usually of psora - the miasm psora - because we have a predisposition due to the

13
00:02:11,524 --> 00:02:21,970
psoric miasm, acute manifestations can come after an exposure to cold, after a lot of

14
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:42,990
drinking alcohol, overheating, excessive exertion, mental excitation...

15
00:02:43,190 --> 00:03:02,856
this is the most interesting excess in sensual enjoyment or deprivation of the same.

16
00:03:03,056 --> 00:03:16,578
I don't know how an acute condition can develop after excess in sensual enjoyment

17
00:03:16,778 --> 00:03:23,643
and even more deprivation of the same.

18
00:03:23,843 --> 00:03:34,990
Deprivation of the sexual activity, that means the organism has a lot of hormonal

19
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:45,694
activity and cannot find an outlet, this can cause a febrile state.

20
00:03:45,894 --> 00:03:55,476
I am not sure, I have not seen, maybe it exists but he mentions it

21
00:03:55,676 --> 00:04:04,452
and I don't know under what conditions these people were living at the time.

22
00:04:04,652 --> 00:04:23,658
What I may suggest for this is that if some young people are engaged in constant

23
00:04:23,858 --> 00:04:35,985
sexual activity to the limit where they are totally exhausted most probably because

24
00:04:36,185 --> 00:04:51,089
the organism is exhausted then will manifest a common cold or an acute condition.

25
00:04:51,289 --> 00:05:08,796
But to attribute this to the deprivation is not understood.

26
00:05:08,996 --> 00:05:20,689
We know deprivation of sexual urge gives a kind of symptomatology

27
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:35,288
which is many times akin to Conium.

28
00:05:35,488 --> 00:05:48,472
If for one reason or another the person, especially the woman, cannot satisfy

29
00:05:48,672 --> 00:06:04,465
her sexual appetite, then the most probable is to develop vertigos of no origin.

30
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:17,640
The labyrinths are Ok, there is no real focus for the vertigos and the vertigos are

31
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:24,739
quite strong and especially when lying down, when getting up from bed, when turning

32
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:28,341
in bed.

33
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:40,188
When you have this kind of vertigos together with deprivation of sexual urge...

34
00:06:40,388 --> 00:06:51,147
In our books we say than Con. is indicated in women who have lost their husbands.

35
00:06:51,347 --> 00:07:02,561
So they need to bring back the balance on that level, they need a dose of Con.

36
00:07:02,761 --> 00:07:12,213
If you don't give Con. to such women, they cannot get over the problem,

37
00:07:12,413 --> 00:07:26,485
whatever it might be. So Con. is a remedy not for acute.

38
00:07:26,685 --> 00:07:37,104
Hahnemann says here they develop a febrile condition which as I said I don't know.

39
00:07:37,304 --> 00:07:46,851
The excess of sexual enjoyment, we have other remedies, we know quite a lot of

40
00:07:47,051 --> 00:08:14,927
remedies. The leading remedy is Platina but also Origanon, Stram., Hyosc., Bell.

41
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:29,666
They have excessive energy in general which affects the brain and they produce

42
00:08:29,866 --> 00:08:39,813
the impulse of the individual to have sexual activity, a lot.

43
00:08:40,013 --> 00:08:47,539
And the sexual activity is not satisfying them. Never mind how much

44
00:08:48,702 --> 00:08:56,314
sexual activity they may have, they want some more, some more...

45
00:08:56,514 --> 00:09:04,879
I remember a case with cancer with metastasis all over and when I realized that it was

46
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:15,540
a case of Plat. I asked her whether she was used to masturbate.

47
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:32,140
She said 40 times a day. It's really excessive. Why is that, it's another story...

48
00:09:47,563 --> 00:09:54,795
"in reality but transient aggravations of latent psora". Attributes them to psora.

49
00:09:54,995 --> 00:10:02,465
This is not absolutely accurate.

50
00:10:02,665 --> 00:10:12,908
Today most of the organisms are coming from a background that has been affected

51
00:10:13,108 --> 00:10:29,140
by gonorrhea, syphilis and by TB, so you cannot say only from psora but it is a way

52
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:38,261
of saying that such a condition is transient and it is going to go away.

53
00:10:40,201 --> 00:10:49,301
"The second class includes sporadic diseases which attack several persons

54
00:10:49,501 --> 00:10:56,831
simultaneously in isolated localities. They are engendered by meteoric or telluric

55
00:10:57,031 --> 00:11:05,352
agencies, to the morbific influence of which, only few persons are susceptible

56
00:11:05,552 --> 00:11:22,436
at a time." He goes very far. His observation is really impressive.

57
00:11:22,636 --> 00:11:33,348
Today science has confirmed that the activity of the sun, when there are sun

58
00:11:33,548 --> 00:11:45,290
explosions, are connected with the manifestation of certain diseases and epidemics.

59
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:56,672
For a man to write this in the year 1800 is really impressive.

60
00:12:00,462 --> 00:12:05,234
And this is also something that a homeopath can notice.

61
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:15,514
I have noticed since many years that when you have a lot of patients to see,

62
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:28,257
not one or two a day but 10-20 a day or more, then you observe the prevalence

63
00:12:31,038 --> 00:12:35,167
at a certain period of a certain pathology.

64
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:51,242
People come with ear problem, arthritic problems, stomach problems.

65
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:07,562
And it is true that I had this idea and then I found out that it has been confirmed

66
00:13:07,762 --> 00:13:15,564
by science that this phenomenon happens.

67
00:13:15,764 --> 00:13:21,919
"Next to this class come the epidemic diseases, which attack many persons at the

68
00:13:22,119 --> 00:13:30,169
same time; they arise from the same cause, and individual cases resemble each other;

69
00:13:30,369 --> 00:13:38,193
these diseases usually become infectious when they pervade crowded districts,

70
00:13:38,393 --> 00:13:47,687
where they create fevers of a distinct kind; and as the cases of disease are of like

71
00:13:47,887 --> 00:13:57,293
origin, they are also alike in their manifestations; but if left to themselves, they will,

72
00:13:57,493 --> 00:14:07,109
within a limited period, terminate in recovery or death."

73
00:14:07,309 --> 00:14:15,341
This is the definition of the acute. Never mind whether there is an epidemic or not.

74
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:28,959
When you have an acute, you have a bronchitis or a bronchopneumonia,

75
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:40,200
this will end either in lysis, if you let it alone, or in death.

76
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:51,222
The percentage of death is different for different febrile conditions.

77
00:14:51,422 --> 00:15:00,982
Influenza has a percentage of deaths, bronchitis has another and

78
00:15:01,182 --> 00:15:08,178
bronchopneumonia another and pneumonia has another.

79
00:15:08,378 --> 00:15:22,248
In any case all these cases they have a prodromal period, an incubation period,

80
00:15:22,448 --> 00:15:29,841
then we have the manifestation of the crisis and then we have the lysis either

81
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:38,164
by death or by cure.

82
00:15:38,364 --> 00:15:50,415
I will say something now you may jump of your seats but unfortunately I have to say.

83
00:15:50,615 --> 00:16:01,533
If humanity in general has been left alone without medications,

84
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:09,521
it would have automatically regulated what today we call the problem

85
00:16:09,721 --> 00:16:16,703
of over population of the planet.

86
00:16:16,903 --> 00:16:23,960
Automatically the epidemic diseases, the acute diseases would have killed so many

87
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:30,567
as they are born.

88
00:16:30,767 --> 00:16:41,771
And the actual number of people living would be almost the same number

89
00:16:41,971 --> 00:16:45,493
all along the years.

90
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:58,156
We have entered into this process of nature by our intelligence and we have

91
00:16:58,356 --> 00:17:08,963
disturbed the overall balance of population in the planet.

92
00:17:10,281 --> 00:17:19,715
What is it going to be the long term results of such interference, I do not know.

93
00:17:21,578 --> 00:17:33,986
I do not know whether this interference will end up in extermination of the race.

94
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:40,183
There is such a possibility according to my understanding.

95
00:17:40,383 --> 00:17:53,669
See the difference if Homeopathy was left alone to treat all acute and chronic

96
00:17:53,869 --> 00:18:04,360
conditions. It would have 2 results.

97
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:15,020
The people would be much happier in general. The people who would stay alive.

98
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:26,192
And a lot more people would die. So a regulation of the population of the Earth

99
00:18:26,392 --> 00:18:37,641
could be with a natural system of healing and automatically the population would

100
00:18:37,841 --> 00:18:45,041
stay healthy with healthy minds.

101
00:18:45,241 --> 00:18:58,461
What was happening in ancient Greece where all these ideas came down and were

102
00:18:58,661 --> 00:19:11,099
distributed in the world and we could have an ideal world where would

103
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:23,259
prevail not the war but peace, not hatred but love.

104
00:19:23,459 --> 00:19:31,166
Because if you give me Nux-v. I am not so much excited and attacking

105
00:19:31,366 --> 00:19:37,978
and I can control myself and I can hear the other point of view.

106
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:48,723
But if I am in a state of Stramonium, I will not listen to anything.

107
00:19:48,923 --> 00:19:58,290
And from such psychotic conditions as we have brought ourselves through the constant

108
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:15,887
suppression of diseases to the CNS, then the world will be much more balanced.

109
00:20:16,087 --> 00:20:30,673
They would understand that the war is not in favor of anybody. But why there is war?

110
00:20:30,873 --> 00:20:35,819
Because there are some minds which are sick.

111
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:39,969
What did they want these minds which are sick?

112
00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:51,112
They want control, power, money to use for power.

113
00:20:52,747 --> 00:21:17,668
Let us say, I will give you today 10 billion euros...

114
00:21:17,868 --> 00:21:27,756
Do you think you will become more happy? You will be excited for one hour or two

115
00:21:27,956 --> 00:21:34,799
and then you will go into deep depression and anxiety on how to increase these

116
00:21:34,999 --> 00:21:47,546
money or how to keep these money. You will be the most unhappy people of the world.

117
00:21:47,746 --> 00:21:59,918
I treated a lot of very wealthy people and I know what I am saying to you is a fact.

118
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:06,288
They have the appearance that they are happy.

119
00:22:06,488 --> 00:22:19,012
I remember one who was telling me that he wanted to give a lot of money to

120
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:28,348
somebody who said why do you give me this? I don't need it.

121
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:36,450
But he says please take it. He said because I wanted to feel that I have done

122
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:45,366
something to feel some emotions. That I did a good thing and gave it to this person

123
00:22:45,566 --> 00:22:53,971
and this person was very happy and I gave happiness to a person, maybe I could move

124
00:22:54,171 --> 00:23:04,492
something in me, as far as feelings were concerned. Please take it.

125
00:23:04,692 --> 00:23:12,907
I told you three cars have been given to me as a present.

126
00:23:13,107 --> 00:23:19,546
The first car was given to me by a very rich man, one of the richest in Greece.

127
00:23:19,746 --> 00:23:28,271
He came here to be treated and drove with him in my jeep, I had an old jeep.

128
00:23:28,471 --> 00:23:41,829
He says has it any brakes? I said yes don't worry I have brakes and we can stop.

129
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:58,825
Then he called his secretary and said send George the blue jeep... it's from him.

130
00:23:59,025 --> 00:24:04,936
I said thank you. I had no problem.

131
00:24:07,773 --> 00:24:14,952
I have treated these people and I have seen their shortcomings.

132
00:24:15,152 --> 00:24:25,418
He said to me I want you to promise that if I have cancer ever you will give me

133
00:24:25,618 --> 00:24:38,668
something to kill me. We don't have such remedies. We have remedies only to heal.

134
00:24:38,868 --> 00:24:49,850
The idea that he could go in suffering after such a luxurious life...

135
00:24:50,050 --> 00:25:02,141
This is also interesting, we have to note, that the nature has its own laws of natural

136
00:25:02,341 --> 00:25:12,293
selection. Therefore it has allowed certain diseases which we call epidemics to

137
00:25:12,493 --> 00:25:26,734
be contagious. If there is an over population and there is an epidemic, a lot of people

138
00:25:26,934 --> 00:25:37,382
will be infected and will die through the epidemic. So it's a natural selection.

139
00:25:37,582 --> 00:25:46,731
Nature had to have some means to reduce the population and to keep the balance.

140
00:25:46,931 --> 00:25:53,589
The epidemics were the tool of the nature to keep the number of the people living

141
00:25:53,789 --> 00:26:05,184
on the earth in a balance state and increase but not an explosion of population.

142
00:26:05,384 --> 00:26:10,834
Here we have an explosion of population.

143
00:26:11,034 --> 00:26:19,476
The last 50 years from 3,5 billion we have come to 8 billion people.

144
00:26:19,676 --> 00:26:24,900
It's a tremendous explosion. Due to what? Due to medicine.

145
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:31,775
So the question is why you don't like medicine if you can save so many lives?

146
00:26:31,975 --> 00:26:39,469
The question is philosophically if you take it and you see the long run of this issue,

147
00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:44,278
you end up in extermination of the human race.

148
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:50,012
The other way, natural selection, but you have the healing method that brings more

149
00:26:50,212 --> 00:27:01,575
and more health to the people, eventually after 3-4 centuries

150
00:27:01,775 --> 00:27:09,490
the human race is rectified, is becoming healthier and healthier.

151
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:14,065
The people who live, live in a healthy state and

152
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:23,935
a healthy individual cannot run into war, into crazy things...

153
00:27:24,135 --> 00:27:35,409
cannot kill each other for a few arguments or for a few euros...

154
00:27:39,169 --> 00:27:48,160
You see how wrongly the whole set up of the earth has been perceived and

155
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:53,585
everybody thinks medicine is correct because it saves my life.

156
00:27:53,785 --> 00:28:03,630
Vaccination is correct because it eliminated smallpox... they don't see the long-term

157
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:15,741
effect and they don't see the underlying degeneration which is due to such practices.

158
00:28:18,637 --> 00:28:35,845
If I put this lecture on the internet, I will make Homeopathy very popular.

159
00:28:36,045 --> 00:28:52,173
But at the expense of my immediate termination. I like to do it.

160
00:28:52,373 --> 00:29:03,893
My disease is this that I am provocative...

161
00:29:04,093 --> 00:29:09,984
This is part of a disease of course, it is not totally healthy.

162
00:29:10,184 --> 00:29:16,221
If you know what you are doing is going to kill you and you do it, then you are not

163
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:27,063
totally healthy even if what you did is saving the humanity.

164
00:29:30,259 --> 00:29:42,320
Genius, you agree? Shall I put it on the Internet?

165
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,431
-No.

166
00:29:45,631 --> 00:30:12,548
-Who says yes? 3,4...7. You want to preserve myself. I will not be preserved in any case.

167
00:30:12,748 --> 00:30:19,230
For other reasons. Not because they will kill me.

168
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:23,132
But Homeopathy will become popular.

169
00:30:23,332 --> 00:30:34,115
The idea will be discussed by all the media and will be in favor and against...

170
00:30:34,315 --> 00:30:44,858
People who are controlling us, they will think what a good idea maybe we have to do it...

171
00:30:45,058 --> 00:30:59,291
but we ourselves will take the real medicine so we can stay alive and all the others...

172
00:31:05,783 --> 00:31:12,765
Since a long time I have this idea of writing an article on these matters.

173
00:31:12,965 --> 00:31:27,635
But I have avoided so far. I don't know if... I can use a nickname?

174
00:31:27,835 --> 00:31:54,797
By the time they want to find out, immediately they will find out who it is.

175
00:32:05,052 --> 00:32:20,236
"It is a matter of regret that we are still obliged to count among chronic diseases

176
00:32:20,436 --> 00:32:27,579
very common affections which are to be regarded as the result of allopathic treatment,

177
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:37,225
and the continual use of violent, heroic medicines, in large and increasing doses.

178
00:32:37,425 --> 00:32:58,164
Examples of that kind are: the abuse of calomel, corrosive sublimate, mercurial

179
00:32:58,364 --> 00:33:07,911
ointment, nitrate of silver, iodine and its ointments, opium, valerian, Peruvian bark

180
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:17,650
and quinia, digitalis, prussic acid, sulphur and sulphuric acid, the use of purgatives

181
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:32,821
persisted in for years, bloodletting, leeches, issues, setons...

182
00:33:33,021 --> 00:33:39,598
[...]During this exhausting and deleterious treatment, the vital force is compelled,

183
00:33:39,798 --> 00:33:47,370
in defense of life, to alter the entire organism.

184
00:33:50,343 --> 00:34:03,983
Accordingly, it diminishes or increases the irritability, or sensibility of various parts..."

185
00:34:08,517 --> 00:34:21,746
In this phrase he says something which if you are careful you should ask me a question.

186
00:34:21,946 --> 00:34:45,196
The allopathic medicine of the time diminishes or increases the irritability.

187
00:34:45,396 --> 00:34:56,396
The question you should ask is when the irritability is decreased isn't it a good thing?

188
00:35:01,981 --> 00:35:15,574
They idea here is that the natural tendencies, parameters, qualities of the human

189
00:35:15,774 --> 00:35:27,822
organism are different for each other. Some people are easily angered,

190
00:35:28,022 --> 00:35:38,765
some others are more calm, some are very calm they never get angry.

191
00:35:38,965 --> 00:35:51,357
There is a natural state of the human in healthy state which contains irritability,

192
00:35:51,557 --> 00:36:01,472
certain amount of anxiety, concern for others.

193
00:36:01,672 --> 00:36:13,713
Hahnemann knows that and knows that the increase of irritability or the diminution

194
00:36:13,913 --> 00:36:23,012
of it is a pathology. Therefore we have to understand that each one of us has certain

195
00:36:23,212 --> 00:36:29,986
qualities. One is very fast in his mind, perceives things very fast, the other takes longer

196
00:36:30,186 --> 00:36:35,011
time, both are healthy.

197
00:36:35,211 --> 00:36:44,817
If the natural irritability of a person becomes excessive, then it becomes a pathology.

198
00:36:45,017 --> 00:36:53,111
Then you have to decrease and the remedy will decrease the excessive irritability.

199
00:36:53,311 --> 00:37:02,864
Many times you put the question. What do you mean by irritability or anxiety?

200
00:37:03,064 --> 00:37:21,111
Anxiety and irritability are possibilities our brain has in order to cope with life.

201
00:37:21,311 --> 00:37:36,105
If we did not have the possibility of fear, you see a lion and you go to pet it and

202
00:37:36,305 --> 00:37:47,966
he eats you up. Because there is no fear. If there was no the possibility of fear.

203
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:59,214
When there is no possibility of fear a lot of outrageous things could take place.

204
00:37:59,414 --> 00:38:06,769
You are not afraid so you are in the brink of a wall and then you fall.

205
00:38:06,969 --> 00:38:14,208
Therefore fear is needed. The moment that fear becomes a burden,

206
00:38:14,408 --> 00:38:20,483
a limitation to your life, then it becomes pathology.

207
00:38:20,683 --> 00:38:28,266
The moment that the anger becomes so great that becomes a limitation to your life,

208
00:38:28,466 --> 00:38:36,712
then you need treatment. But you need the anger to react.

209
00:38:36,912 --> 00:38:45,901
An organism who does not produce anger ever is a dead organism

210
00:38:46,101 --> 00:38:56,470
and that means this organ or the place of the organ of anger which is a part in the brain

211
00:38:56,670 --> 00:39:12,124
has been dulled, killed, exterminated due to chemical drugs you have been using.

212
00:39:12,324 --> 00:39:31,549
See how simple it is? 250 years ago this man had perceived that, exactly.

213
00:39:31,749 --> 00:39:47,284
It is a phenomenon which I have not seen in any Nobel Prize winners who are

214
00:39:47,484 --> 00:40:00,967
supposed to be big minds. Big minds discover an enzyme which is going to be...

215
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:07,205
for the future of humanity if we cultivate this enzyme and give it back

216
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:12,907
to the organism, then we will have excessive results...

217
00:40:13,107 --> 00:40:26,636
This never happens... the alternative Nobel Prize is more important.

218
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:35,476
There is a reason I say that.

219
00:40:35,676 --> 00:40:43,807
In order they would give me the Alternative Nobel Prize, they were observing my life

220
00:40:44,007 --> 00:40:56,709
for 7 years. And the idea is on this Prize how much you have benefited humanity.

221
00:40:56,909 --> 00:41:00,932
Have you already benefited the humanity? Then we will give you the prize.

222
00:41:01,132 --> 00:41:09,466
The Nobel Prize is not... whether you benefited or not it's not important.

223
00:41:09,666 --> 00:41:20,684
What's important is to discover something new. I've told you many times.

224
00:41:20,884 --> 00:41:29,907
The last, the 7th year they asked me for a report, what you have done this year and

225
00:41:30,107 --> 00:41:36,030
I said to my secretary don't send them, they are never going to give it to me,

226
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:46,383
don't send the report. That year I was elected to get the Prize.

227
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:52,623
It's not the money because the money is a quarter of what the Nobel Prize is.

228
00:41:52,823 --> 00:42:04,054
It's much less but it's the prestige that gave a lot of promotion to Homeopathy

229
00:42:04,254 --> 00:42:16,374
and that was important. Anyhow the Nobel Prize is also good.

230
00:42:41,298 --> 00:42:49,285
"[...] If not entirely prostrated, it is gradually and abnormally deranged,

231
00:42:49,485 --> 00:42:58,308
according to the individual character of each drug.

232
00:42:58,508 --> 00:43:06,150
During this exhausting and deleterious treatment, the vital force is compelled,

233
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:18,654
in defense of life, to alter the entire organism."

234
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:34,581
He says, if you inject things in the organism, the organism in order to be kept alive

235
00:43:34,781 --> 00:43:52,957
it has to rearrange things within the organism. It means a multimillion changes in

236
00:43:53,157 --> 00:44:03,428
the electrochemical, biochemical structure of the organism.

237
00:44:03,628 --> 00:44:20,366
They have to adapt the bad function of the liver which is not producing this particular

238
00:44:20,566 --> 00:44:25,061
product which is needed for the kidneys.

239
00:44:25,261 --> 00:44:33,581
The kidneys have to rearrange themselves, the heart has to rearrange itself,

240
00:44:33,781 --> 00:44:46,270
the calcium, the potassium has to be rearranged...

241
00:44:54,074 --> 00:45:03,901
When there is a kidney failure, the kidneys are not functioning...

242
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:11,284
What is one of the most common side effects?

243
00:45:11,484 --> 00:45:19,965
One is anemia which is produced and at the same time the increase of the potassium

244
00:45:20,165 --> 00:45:26,862
in the organism which can bring a heart attack.

245
00:45:27,062 --> 00:45:34,806
All these rearrangements were due to the fact that the person got gonorrhea, that

246
00:45:35,006 --> 00:45:45,676
was treated through antibiotics and finally another gonorrhea and again antibiotics

247
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:54,554
and finally the breakdown of the kidneys. But in the meantime the organism tries

248
00:45:54,754 --> 00:46:16,250
to survive and rearranges. Why does it raise the potassium level?

249
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:27,714
You understand that he has seen exactly that.

250
00:46:27,914 --> 00:46:36,345
The organism has to rearrange in order to preserve life, so the person will not die.

251
00:46:36,545 --> 00:46:47,641
And this is what we are practicing all the time. We inject, the organism rearranges

252
00:46:47,841 --> 00:46:53,658
until one organ or another breaks down and that's the end.

253
00:47:07,797 --> 00:47:16,088
"Accordingly, it diminishes or increases the irritability, or sensibility of various parts;

254
00:47:16,288 --> 00:47:23,909
it produces hypertrophy or atrophy; softening or induration in certain organs, resulting

255
00:47:24,109 --> 00:47:36,812
eventually in destruction, or, at least, in organic lesions (deformities) of external or

256
00:47:37,012 --> 00:47:45,494
internal parts. These are some of the results of the efforts of nature to protect the

257
00:47:45,694 --> 00:47:55,647
organism against complete destruction, to which it is exposed by the constant renewal

258
00:47:55,847 --> 00:48:06,559
of aggressive treatment with pernicious substances."

259
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:17,178
Paragraph 75, "Instances of ruined health, resulting from allopathic treatment, are very

260
00:48:17,378 --> 00:48:29,312
common in modern times. They constitute the most pitiable, and incurable of chronic

261
00:48:29,512 --> 00:48:40,473
diseases..." He says something which is really scaring.

262
00:48:40,673 --> 00:48:49,193
He says if somebody has taken repeatedly this kind of treatments,

263
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:54,349
eventually he becomes incurable.

264
00:49:03,792 --> 00:49:15,976
"and it is to be feared that remedies will probably never be found, or invented for the

265
00:49:16,176 --> 00:49:25,941
cure of such condition, when they have reached a certain degree of severity."

266
00:49:26,141 --> 00:49:34,080
He had the same experience as we have when in the end stages of pathology

267
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:43,076
we cannot see the remedy. He says remedies will not be found.

268
00:49:43,276 --> 00:49:49,694
Not these I know so far but even in the future. If you find more remedies, you will not

269
00:49:49,894 --> 00:49:58,474
be able to find remedies that will cure damage done by chemical drugs.

270
00:50:02,234 --> 00:50:12,037
You want to ask a question? Sure. If you want to ask a question, you have to ask.

271
00:50:12,237 --> 00:50:17,385
Otherwise if we proceed and some questions stay in your mind, there is no meaning.

272
00:50:17,585 --> 00:50:28,286
You come here to clarify, if you are interested. Can you come here?

273
00:50:30,962 --> 00:50:38,835
Whoever wants to ask a question will come here to be a famous person

274
00:50:39,035 --> 00:50:47,320
who will be videoed and will remain in the history of Homeopathy!

275
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:54,382
When you put a question, that means you contribute to the teaching

276
00:50:54,582 --> 00:51:02,269
of a future medicine, which is going to overwhelm the world.

277
00:51:02,469 --> 00:51:06,900
So you will become famous all over the world!

278
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:12,690
-I want to ask, Hahnemann says here that by allopathic treatment which leads

279
00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:21,294
to chronic diseases, there is no healing treatment...

280
00:51:21,494 --> 00:51:24,220
-There is no remedy that can heal such a condition.

281
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:30,849
-But I want to ask. Yesterday the small girl...

282
00:51:31,049 --> 00:51:34,755
-The Still disease.

283
00:51:34,955 --> 00:51:45,452
-She was sent to be treated by allopathic treatment and then she comes again and

284
00:51:45,652 --> 00:51:53,249
can she be treated after that?

285
00:51:53,449 --> 00:52:00,302
-I said that in this condition because it's progressed too far, we cannot discover

286
00:52:00,502 --> 00:52:07,708
the indicated remedy. The remedy cannot be found in this condition.

287
00:52:07,908 --> 00:52:14,926
Therefore we have to face the problem with the parents.

288
00:52:15,126 --> 00:52:24,663
The parents say what shall we do? The child is in pain. You have to tell them what to do.

289
00:52:24,863 --> 00:52:32,737
If you tell them I cannot do anything anymore, what they will most probably do is to

290
00:52:32,937 --> 00:52:43,709
take the child to the hospital and the hospital will treat the child with violent medicine.

291
00:52:43,909 --> 00:52:54,966
What I say further than that is that maybe due to the many remedies given,

292
00:52:55,166 --> 00:53:10,908
the actual symptoms are masked and if through the giving of strong drugs, we can

293
00:53:11,108 --> 00:53:20,913
kind of nullify or neutralize the effect of the homeopathic remedies given so far,

294
00:53:21,113 --> 00:53:28,588
the child will come to a much more difficult condition.

295
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:35,804
She will be given drugs and after a while there is going to be a relapse.

296
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:43,808
That time when the relapse comes, there is a possibility we may recognize a clearer

297
00:53:44,008 --> 00:53:51,227
picture in which case we may enter again starting the treatment.

298
00:53:51,427 --> 00:53:59,760
I don't know if that will work. Most probably the child is incurable as far as

299
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:11,696
Homeopathy is concerned. But the child will remain alive, will not die but with a lot

300
00:54:11,896 --> 00:54:16,122
of problems, mental, emotional and physical.

301
00:54:16,322 --> 00:54:24,587
Especially if the physical problems of that child are eliminated,

302
00:54:24,787 --> 00:54:33,389
she will have tremendous problems in mental and emotional condition.

303
00:54:33,589 --> 00:54:37,849
If she is not treated homeopathically, she will go.

304
00:54:38,049 --> 00:54:45,098
Now mentally/ emotionally she is quite... she was present, she was aware.

305
00:54:45,298 --> 00:54:51,516
Mental and emotional state was perfect.

306
00:54:51,716 --> 00:54:59,306
Let me see her after the allopathic treatment.

307
00:55:06,712 --> 00:55:12,503
-I have an objection concerning the emotional health of this child.

308
00:55:12,703 --> 00:55:16,380
Because she had a big aversion to her mother. It's a big emotional issue for a child of

309
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:20,188
7 years old. So I don't think she is emotionally healthy.

310
00:55:20,388 --> 00:55:24,218
Perhaps this issue which we didn't emphasize very much in the analysis

311
00:55:24,418 --> 00:55:32,000
is connected to her problem. That's what I think.

312
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:45,409
-I won't argue with you. But I still have to tell a few things concerning the depth

313
00:55:45,609 --> 00:55:56,020
of the pathology. If the pathology goes inside into the mental and emotional,

314
00:55:56,220 --> 00:56:03,761
you will see a totally different child altogether.

315
00:56:03,961 --> 00:56:12,450
That will never be satisfied... depression, anxiety, panics.

316
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:18,225
The fact, you are right...

317
00:57:03,872 --> 00:57:14,314
Let us say a person who has disgust.

318
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:20,760
Once she saw the fly going inside, she will never touch this.

319
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:31,237
I also don't feel nice if a fly is inside but my disgust is natural.

320
00:57:31,437 --> 00:57:42,371
Her disgust for her mother is natural because her mother has behaved in such a way

321
00:57:42,571 --> 00:57:52,525
that she has hurt her tremendously. I don't know details, maybe they can tell us,

322
00:57:52,725 --> 00:58:07,271
but must be a mother which is a real... bitch.

323
00:58:11,224 --> 00:58:17,122
Why does she like this particular cup?

324
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:38,959
I don't want to go over the time because I know you are...

325
00:58:43,256 --> 00:58:51,479
-The old homeopathic schools all they say is that camphor oil can spoil

326
00:58:51,679 --> 00:58:57,879
all the negative problems from wrong remedies...

327
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:07,381
I even tried it myself in case of pains with wrong remedies and really felt a relief

328
00:59:07,581 --> 00:59:13,945
as if the pressure has gone away. This might be a solution.

329
00:59:14,145 --> 00:59:25,013
-This is true. Either coffee or camphor could be used as antidotes.

330
00:59:27,911 --> 00:59:37,788
But in this case she needs a really powerful shake in the organism to bring back

331
00:59:37,988 --> 00:59:52,938
the original state. Camphor or coffee will not be sufficient.

332
00:59:53,138 --> 00:59:57,007
This is my impression but this is also my experience.

333
00:59:57,207 --> 01:00:05,363
I've seen this happening that after they have been taking allopathic drugs,

334
01:00:05,563 --> 01:00:13,735
they come back in a very bad state, then I am able to see the remedy.

335
01:00:33,805 --> 01:01:01,409
Paragraph 76, "It is only through homoeopathy that providence has vouchsafed to us

336
01:01:01,609 --> 01:01:10,982
the means of curing natural diseases; but not those chronic external and internal

337
01:01:11,182 --> 01:01:18,578
lesions and deformities, wantonly forced upon the human organism by unskillful

338
01:01:18,778 --> 01:01:24,637
treatment, and pernicious medicines."

339
01:01:24,837 --> 01:01:34,526
Hahnemann was claiming much less than we claim today that we can cure.

340
01:01:34,726 --> 01:01:48,372
He said whether we have a deformity or we have internal lesions,

341
01:01:48,572 --> 01:01:55,749
then forget about cure.

342
01:02:00,515 --> 01:02:07,316
"...wantonly forced upon the human organism by unskillful treatment,

343
01:02:07,516 --> 01:02:16,120
and pernicious medicines."

344
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:19,882
He says whatever has happened in an organism... that means he has tried and

345
01:02:20,082 --> 01:02:29,668
found he could not cure. People who have taken a lot of the derivatives of mercury,

346
01:02:29,868 --> 01:02:38,953
of opium, morphine he was not able to cure them anymore.

347
01:02:44,342 --> 01:02:53,053
But it's very strange. When you talk with conventional doctors, the first thing

348
01:02:53,253 --> 01:02:58,992
they will ask you is Homeopathy can cure cancer?

349
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:09,030
Wait a moment, before you reach cancer, all this hierarchy of diseases

350
01:03:09,230 --> 01:03:14,125
you are not interested to cure? You are interested to cure only the cancer?

351
01:03:14,325 --> 01:03:20,327
What is your results on cancer? Nothing, I don't cure cancer.

352
01:03:20,527 --> 01:03:34,192
What about all the others? If you can cure cancer, then we are interested.

353
01:03:34,392 --> 01:03:39,696
"Nevertheless, if proper measures are directed against the chronic miasm, perhaps

354
01:03:39,896 --> 01:03:49,504
lurking in the system, the vital force might still be made to undo much of the mischief,

355
01:03:49,704 --> 01:03:58,030
provided it had not been weakened by treatment to such an extent as to prevent it

356
01:03:58,230 --> 01:04:05,879
from being undisturbed for a sufficient number of years, required for the

357
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:18,376
accomplishment of the enormous task." He says his experience is this.

358
01:04:18,576 --> 01:04:27,698
When he has met with such cases he used other measures like correcting the food

359
01:04:27,898 --> 01:04:38,629
intake, the mode of life and give the possibility of the organism to react, so he can bring

360
01:04:38,829 --> 01:04:47,040
out some symptoms, on which he can base the prescription and sometimes it can...

361
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:59,445
He doesn't say cure anymore he says "might still be made to undo much of the

362
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:05,263
mischief".

363
01:05:07,716 --> 01:05:27,299
I read from another 6th edition but a good translation by C. Wesselhoeft M.D.

364
01:05:27,499 --> 01:05:35,444
This was published in 1917 by Boericke and Taffel in the U.S.

365
01:05:35,644 --> 01:05:44,664
and it was an expensive book and then Jane Publisher produced the one that you have.

366
01:05:44,864 --> 01:05:52,546
With Boericke translation which is different than this one.

367
01:06:10,006 --> 01:06:21,144
"The art of healing is not, and never will be perfected so far, as to enable us to rectify

368
01:06:21,344 --> 01:06:32,831
the countless ill effects so often observed after allopathic treatment".

369
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:58,283
This child which we saw he had all the kinds of vaccination, all kinds of antibiotics etc.

370
01:06:58,483 --> 01:07:04,721
To undo this he was trying the poor man, he is one of the best homeopaths in

371
01:07:04,921 --> 01:07:14,886
Germany, he was trying to counteract the damage that had been done.

372
01:07:15,086 --> 01:07:26,224
The damage is not only what you see. You see the deformities.

373
01:07:26,424 --> 01:07:43,836
The damage is in the system. The whole organism is damaged by this interference.

374
01:07:44,036 --> 01:07:50,560
I will make another prediction that the race, because we are different races...

375
01:07:50,760 --> 01:08:02,959
South Americans, Indians, North Americans, Canadians, Greeks, Germans...

376
01:08:03,159 --> 01:08:15,160
The race will adapt the soonest Homeopathy as main treatment will be the one

377
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:24,156
that will survive finally after 2000 years.

378
01:08:24,356 --> 01:08:30,867
After 2000 years few people will remain in the planet and these people will be using

379
01:08:31,067 --> 01:08:38,645
only Homeopathy. It's easy to make such a prediction.

380
01:08:38,845 --> 01:08:48,115
Who is going to live 2000 years to say George you are wrong.

381
01:08:48,315 --> 01:08:56,505
But what is written now, it can continue for thousands of years.

382
01:08:56,705 --> 01:09:03,965
Another 2000 years about the humanity will take before it can correct itself

383
01:09:04,165 --> 01:09:15,562
with all the atrocities and the mistakes and the stupidities they have done.

384
01:09:19,491 --> 01:09:27,231
I don't want to go into politics because...

385
01:09:28,541 --> 01:09:36,893
I will read one more paragraph 77, "The name of chronic diseases does not apply to

386
01:09:37,093 --> 01:09:45,902
those which are produced by constant exposure to avoidable noxious influences;

387
01:09:46,102 --> 01:09:54,712
by indulgence in habitual excesses in eating, drinking, and various kinds of health

388
01:09:54,912 --> 01:10:04,538
destroying debauchery; nor to those diseases which result from constant want of

389
01:10:04,738 --> 01:10:17,397
the necessaries of life; unhealthy dwellings, particularly in marshy localities;

390
01:10:17,597 --> 01:10:23,063
diseases peculiar to the inhabitants of cellars."

391
01:10:23,263 --> 01:10:34,142
Here Hahnemann is not very accurate, I will tell you why.

392
01:10:35,605 --> 01:10:42,339
"diseases peculiar to the inhabitants of cellars or other confined places, suffering

393
01:10:42,539 --> 01:10:49,610
from want of fresh air and exercise; nor those which are the result of overtaxed

394
01:10:49,810 --> 01:10:58,582
body and mind, or continued mortifications and trouble."

395
01:11:01,314 --> 01:11:09,779
So he says you cannot call chronic disease, a disease which comes from overdrinking

396
01:11:09,979 --> 01:11:14,901
that means from alcoholism.

397
01:11:15,101 --> 01:11:27,452
If somebody lives in an unhealthy environment and he is sick because of that

398
01:11:27,652 --> 01:11:37,256
you have to take into consideration, in order to understand this, two things.

399
01:11:37,456 --> 01:11:46,370
First that most probably what he means here is that you cannot consider it as a chronic

400
01:11:46,570 --> 01:11:58,375
condition, as long as once the conditions change, they will come back to health.

401
01:11:58,575 --> 01:12:06,531
I don't know if he will say later on but this is most probably what he means.

402
01:12:06,731 --> 01:12:20,656
That means as long as you have a pain in the knee because of the wetness in a cellar,

403
01:12:20,856 --> 01:12:31,543
unless you bring out this man to the sun and live a normal life, if the organism can

404
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:40,306
by itself restore health, this is not considered a chronic condition.

405
01:12:40,506 --> 01:12:58,302
But if this condition continues for some time... this is recorded, that's my problem.

406
01:12:58,502 --> 01:13:09,377
Everyone will see I was playing with the flies! You excuse me because we have to

407
01:13:09,577 --> 01:13:23,596
laugh sometimes. If you are very serious all the time, you will go to sleep.

408
01:13:23,796 --> 01:13:34,439
If this condition continues for a long period of time, it will trigger the chronic

409
01:13:34,639 --> 01:13:45,168
predisposition of the organism and then we will have the manifestation of a chronic

410
01:13:45,368 --> 01:13:57,792
disease due to alcohol or bad living in an unhealthy environment etc.

411
01:13:57,992 --> 01:14:09,867
There is a point where the organism in order to counteract or to survive has to bring up

412
01:14:10,067 --> 01:14:21,491
a defense. This defense triggers the second line of defense

413
01:14:21,691 --> 01:14:33,306
which is triggering the predisposition which is genetically ingrained into his body.

414
01:14:36,116 --> 01:14:48,080
Hahnemann does not say exactly that. He says, this you cannot consider

415
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:54,756
as chronic but we must have in mind that if they continue too long,

416
01:14:54,956 --> 01:15:01,262
they will trigger chronic conditions.

417
01:15:01,462 --> 01:15:06,222
"Provided there is no other chronic miasm pervading the organism, unhealthy

418
01:15:06,422 --> 01:15:19,408
conditions like the above, will vanish of their own accord, under an improved mode

419
01:15:19,608 --> 01:15:25,329
of living, and they do not deserve the name of chronic diseases."
