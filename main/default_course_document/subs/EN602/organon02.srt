1
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:33,137
In paragraph 44, he is asking the question if two similar diseases are met

2
00:00:33,337 --> 00:00:37,091
in the organism what happens?

3
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:44,191
Do they go to different places and the answer is given in paragraph 45.

4
00:00:44,391 --> 00:00:52,506
He says, "No! Two diseases, differing, it is true, in kind but very similar

5
00:00:52,706 --> 00:01:00,299
in their phenomena..." What does he mean by that?

6
00:01:00,499 --> 00:01:06,345
He says two diseases which are different in pathology

7
00:01:06,545 --> 00:01:12,865
but similar in their phenomena...

8
00:01:13,065 --> 00:01:20,152
Do you understand? Can anybody tell me what he understands of that?

9
00:01:32,866 --> 00:01:48,099
There are different pathologies but if the overall symptoms are similar

10
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:57,967
the remedy is the same. I will give you an example.

11
00:02:03,596 --> 00:02:17,627
You have a case of gastritis with heartburns

12
00:02:17,827 --> 00:02:27,317
which needs according to the symptoms Nux-v.

13
00:02:27,517 --> 00:02:34,604
because of heartburn and different other Nux-v. symptoms.

14
00:02:34,804 --> 00:02:43,798
And you have another case of spastic colitis,

15
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:56,787
which the overall symptoms indicate the same remedy, Nux-v.

16
00:02:56,987 --> 00:03:10,167
Though the pathology is different "but very similar in their phenomena

17
00:03:10,367 --> 00:03:18,053
and effects and in the sufferings and symptoms they severally produce,

18
00:03:18,253 --> 00:03:23,357
invariably annihilate one another, whenever they meet together

19
00:03:23,557 --> 00:03:35,081
in the organism." What he means here, still we do not see today.

20
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:49,950
As I said before, this cannot be seen by us because we quickly stop

21
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:55,848
the disease by some medication and so we do not allow time for

22
00:04:00,453 --> 00:04:02,667
another disease to come and cure the previous one.

23
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:25,873
In his mind the understanding has come how diseases are cured.

24
00:04:28,742 --> 00:04:33,627
So he observes this phenomenon, which we cannot observe anymore

25
00:04:33,827 --> 00:04:46,207
but for him suddenly comes the light. This is the way nature cures diseases.

26
00:04:50,161 --> 00:05:03,815
Later on he will find out that remedies produce similar symptomatology

27
00:05:04,015 --> 00:05:12,491
with diseases and when a remedy is producing a similar symptomatology,

28
00:05:12,691 --> 00:05:16,920
then that remedy can cure the disease.

29
00:05:22,438 --> 00:05:29,068
This paragraph has no other meaning, he explains his way of thinking

30
00:05:29,268 --> 00:05:38,359
before he arrives at the conclusion, that in order to cure a disease,

31
00:05:38,559 --> 00:05:45,641
nature cures this way, therefore the natural way to cure is the way

32
00:05:47,422 --> 00:05:49,159
I am going to tell you later on.

33
00:05:53,070 --> 00:06:06,721
This is the meaning of this paragraph and if you take it literally

34
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:13,157
you may not understand what he says.

35
00:06:43,414 --> 00:06:47,649
"invariably annihilate one another whenever they meet together

36
00:06:47,849 --> 00:06:58,129
in the organism; the stronger disease namely, annihilates the weaker,

37
00:07:01,778 --> 00:07:08,958
and that for this simple reason, because the stronger morbific power

38
00:07:09,158 --> 00:07:16,831
when it invades the system, by reason of its similarity of action

39
00:07:17,031 --> 00:07:24,135
involves precisely the same part of the organism that were previously

40
00:07:24,335 --> 00:07:30,062
affected by the weaker morbid irritation, which, consequently,

41
00:07:30,262 --> 00:07:35,840
can no longer act on these parts, but is extinguished."

42
00:07:39,015 --> 00:07:48,815
In this paragraph he gives an explanation but the explanation is not correct.

43
00:07:53,383 --> 00:08:05,422
He has an understanding but is it correct? We can discuss about it, we'll find out.

44
00:08:05,622 --> 00:08:11,251
He says when a similar disease comes into the organism,

45
00:08:11,451 --> 00:08:16,677
then this similar is stronger.

46
00:08:16,877 --> 00:08:23,181
First of all how do you know it's stronger?

47
00:08:23,381 --> 00:08:33,130
He presupposes that the next disease that comes, which is similar, is stronger.

48
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:45,751
Why? It could be weaker. And because it is stronger, it occupies the places.

49
00:08:45,951 --> 00:08:54,954
If the previous disease was occupying the liver, now the new one which is similar,

50
00:08:55,154 --> 00:09:03,162
comes and occupies the liver itself

51
00:09:03,362 --> 00:09:11,255
and therefore annihilates and extinguishes the previous one.

52
00:09:11,455 --> 00:09:17,299
But what happens with the new one? He does not say.

53
00:09:17,499 --> 00:09:32,045
It's an understanding that he has but his understanding on this point is not correct.

54
00:09:34,631 --> 00:09:40,328
I will explain to you why I say that and what actually happens.

55
00:09:40,528 --> 00:09:46,687
"because whenever the vital force, deranged by the primary disease,

56
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:53,430
is more strongly attacked by the new, very similar, but stronger dynamic

57
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:59,358
morbific power" he assumes that the new is stronger.

58
00:10:06,683 --> 00:10:18,380
With this logic we would have to admit that the similar remedy,

59
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:29,404
which we give and cure the condition, is stronger than the disease.

60
00:10:29,604 --> 00:10:41,195
But this is not true because the potentized remedy cannot cause such

61
00:10:41,395 --> 00:10:51,439
a damage that a real pathology, a real disease can cause in the organism.

62
00:10:52,678 --> 00:11:00,275
We cannot say that the potency we give is stronger.

63
00:11:00,475 --> 00:11:10,152
Later on he will say that the potency is stronger than the disease.

64
00:11:10,352 --> 00:11:17,563
And therefore it's a kind of fight between them and the stronger

65
00:11:17,763 --> 00:11:34,721
annihilates and extinguishes the weaker.

66
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,343
This cannot be true.

67
00:11:52,879 --> 00:12:00,037
These issues have never been discussed. Either some people take this

68
00:12:00,237 --> 00:12:07,273
for granted "this is the Bible and it is finished" or some others say

69
00:12:07,473 --> 00:12:12,925
" I don't understand the Organon" and they don't even read it.

70
00:12:15,593 --> 00:12:23,598
We have to read the Organon with logic and with experience.

71
00:12:23,798 --> 00:12:35,592
Otherwise we will not understand the real treasure that it contains.

72
00:12:35,792 --> 00:12:42,298
If you stay with that in your mind, stronger and weaker disease,

73
00:12:42,498 --> 00:12:45,889
dissimilar is stronger...

74
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:56,972
there is something which is left inside as a question mark.

75
00:13:01,373 --> 00:13:05,440
You feel something is not correct.

76
00:13:18,371 --> 00:13:24,126
"is more strongly attacked by the new, very similar" he repeats the same thing

77
00:13:24,326 --> 00:13:31,258
"but stronger dynamic morbific power, it therefore now remains affected

78
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:40,189
by the latter alone, whereby the original, similar but weaker disease must,

79
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:46,872
as a mere dynamic power without material substratum, cease to exercise

80
00:13:47,072 --> 00:13:55,554
any further morbid influence on the vital force, consequently it must cease to exist".

81
00:13:58,531 --> 00:14:08,205
It makes no logic here but he was not in a position yet to perceive what was

82
00:14:08,405 --> 00:14:14,074
actually happening in the organism under the homeopathic remedy.

83
00:14:14,274 --> 00:14:29,601
But he had noticed that when 2 dissimilar diseases are met there was a kind

84
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:42,499
of annihilation of both. It does not say "the stronger stays".

85
00:14:42,699 --> 00:14:52,443
He says the stronger and the weaker are both annihilated...

86
00:15:24,653 --> 00:15:27,556
I will complete and then you ask.

87
00:15:27,756 --> 00:15:35,754
It's interesting now he had written this all along in the fifth edition

88
00:15:35,954 --> 00:15:41,966
and he seems he was not happy with what he had written.

89
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:57,896
So he comes in the 6th edition and he adds "or (in other words), the new similar

90
00:15:58,096 --> 00:16:07,372
but stronger morbific potency" he introduces the idea of potency now.

91
00:16:07,572 --> 00:16:16,936
"controls the feelings of the patient and hence the life principle

92
00:16:17,136 --> 00:16:22,240
on account of its peculiarity."

93
00:16:35,616 --> 00:16:40,378
He's trying to understand himself what was going on.

94
00:16:42,636 --> 00:16:46,469
"The new similar but stronger morbific potency controls the feelings

95
00:16:46,669 --> 00:16:58,718
of the patient and hence the life principle on account of its peculiarity,

96
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:08,707
can no longer feel the weaker similar which becomes extinguished."

97
00:17:08,907 --> 00:17:26,414
That means the potency of the new similar disease is such

98
00:17:26,614 --> 00:17:33,691
that controls the feelings of the person.

99
00:17:35,396 --> 00:17:44,379
Here the feelings have a different meaning, the actual thing that he wants

100
00:17:44,579 --> 00:17:51,049
to say is the sensation of the patient.

101
00:17:54,006 --> 00:18:10,383
And since it controls the sensation of the patient therefore

102
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:26,504
"controls the life principle on account of its peculiarity" of the new disease.

103
00:18:26,704 --> 00:18:44,189
The new disease controls the feelings of the patient

104
00:18:51,507 --> 00:19:02,809
and for it was never anything material, but a dynamic - spirit-like - affection.

105
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:11,141
The life principle henceforth is affected only and this but temporarily

106
00:19:11,341 --> 00:19:15,760
by the new, similar but stronger morbific potency."

107
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:25,142
The life principle is affected only temporarily.

108
00:19:25,342 --> 00:19:35,169
So he has to explain how a stronger influence extinguishes the weaker

109
00:19:35,369 --> 00:19:40,890
but it doesn't stay itself.

110
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:49,144
He runs into great problems and he cannot explain it.

111
00:19:55,655 --> 00:20:15,522
"The life principle henceforth is affected only" it is absurd

112
00:20:15,722 --> 00:20:23,415
"and this but temporarily". It is affected only for the time being.

113
00:20:26,219 --> 00:20:32,857
"by the new similar but stronger morbific potency".

114
00:20:48,088 --> 00:20:58,281
And later on he will give examples where he'd seen this phenomenon taking place.

115
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:04,825
You want to ask.

116
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:17,032
-I don't understand well. Can you give us an example?

117
00:21:17,232 --> 00:21:24,690
Like something in your practice why Hahnemann is not right?

118
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:37,932
-Here there is no matter of giving examples. It's a theoretical matter.

119
00:21:38,132 --> 00:21:46,994
Hahnemann says that a stronger disease similar extinguishes the weaker.

120
00:21:47,194 --> 00:21:55,143
This is his explanation. He has seen this happening in nature.

121
00:21:55,343 --> 00:22:01,507
This is something which he has observed.

122
00:22:01,707 --> 00:22:11,815
He thinks that this phenomenon takes place because the second disease

123
00:22:12,015 --> 00:22:14,806
is stronger than the first one.

124
00:22:15,006 --> 00:22:19,850
And I say this is wrong. I will explain it to you.

125
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:25,004
I will give you an example but this is what he says here.

126
00:22:25,204 --> 00:22:33,142
This is theoretical explanation, he has seen a fact and he gives his own

127
00:22:33,342 --> 00:22:46,063
explanation and understanding. With my logic this is not correct.

128
00:22:46,263 --> 00:22:52,763
Why? Because there are missing several things.

129
00:22:52,963 --> 00:23:00,337
First of all how come that the stronger disease that affected

130
00:23:00,537 --> 00:23:03,977
the organism does not stay?

131
00:23:17,943 --> 00:23:37,662
If I have a drug that can suppress, extinguish pathology,

132
00:23:37,862 --> 00:23:48,320
then I can say that this drug is stronger than the disease

133
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:55,675
and extinguishes the symptomatology of the disease. This I can say.

134
00:23:55,875 --> 00:24:11,958
But what we know today is that if this drug is stronger than the disease

135
00:24:12,158 --> 00:24:22,557
then this drug will put its stamp on the organism.

136
00:24:27,474 --> 00:24:40,252
This we know it to be true because we know the side effects of all drugs.

137
00:24:40,452 --> 00:24:46,334
All drugs which are given for extinguishing the disease

138
00:24:46,534 --> 00:24:57,293
are stronger than the disease and they suppress

139
00:24:57,493 --> 00:25:03,120
whatever pathological manifestation is there.

140
00:25:11,724 --> 00:25:17,503
-I want to point a question that 3 paragraphs later, in paragraph 50

141
00:25:17,703 --> 00:25:24,636
Hahnemann says the disease after that stays, he never says that it goes off,

142
00:25:24,836 --> 00:25:30,831
he just gives this example here but after that says that some of the disease go

143
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:36,639
if it is morbid it goes. Some of the disease stay.

144
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:41,328
When they are similar, the stronger disease stays after that in the organism.

145
00:25:41,528 --> 00:25:53,301
This is a disadvantage of this way. The question is why you think it is not right?

146
00:25:53,501 --> 00:26:00,368
-How else can I explain? I have already explained.

147
00:26:02,744 --> 00:26:07,522
When there are 2 dissimilar diseases, the one suppresses the other

148
00:26:07,722 --> 00:26:12,989
or they find different places where they stay.

149
00:26:13,189 --> 00:26:20,013
In conventional treatment the drug which is given is always stronger

150
00:26:20,213 --> 00:26:24,536
than the disease...

151
00:26:24,736 --> 00:26:31,966
Wait, if you don't understand this try to listen to what I say

152
00:26:32,166 --> 00:26:36,924
because I cannot repeat too many times.

153
00:26:37,124 --> 00:26:45,771
The disease can be extinguished by a stronger drug.

154
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:52,529
-But the drug is not similar.

155
00:26:56,193 --> 00:27:06,275
-Here he says that if the disease is similar, it's stronger.

156
00:27:06,475 --> 00:27:12,241
So my argument is not that it doesn't work...

157
00:27:12,441 --> 00:27:16,537
this works but not in the way he explains it.

158
00:27:16,737 --> 00:27:23,985
It does not happen in the way he explains. It happens in another way.

159
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:31,938
I will explain to you now what is the way that happens to cure

160
00:27:32,138 --> 00:27:36,868
the disease by a similar remedy.

161
00:27:52,436 --> 00:27:59,180
-I understood this paragraph in that way. If somebody has a sore throat

162
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:05,840
that will be cured by Bell. but while he is in that process, he has also meningitis,

163
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,474
he will also be cured with Bell.

164
00:28:08,674 --> 00:28:12,814
So the meningitis is the most dangerous disease and will override the sore throat.

165
00:28:13,014 --> 00:28:18,469
Both are cured with Bell. This I understood from the paragraph.

166
00:28:18,669 --> 00:28:29,210
-No, it's another thing you are saying. It's different.

167
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:33,126
I will give you now the explanation.

168
00:28:33,326 --> 00:28:40,967
What is the explanation of the similar and how it acts?

169
00:28:41,167 --> 00:28:51,940
When there is the manifestation of a symptomatology due to a disease,

170
00:28:52,140 --> 00:29:01,836
this manifestation is what we call the overall symptoms of the patient.

171
00:29:02,036 --> 00:29:08,758
So the symptoms of the patient what do they represent?

172
00:29:08,958 --> 00:29:19,352
They represent bad guys that appear the headache, the fever and all that?

173
00:29:19,552 --> 00:29:24,143
All these are bad things happening in the organism?

174
00:29:24,343 --> 00:29:34,358
Or the organism in its effort to cure itself produces these symptoms?

175
00:29:36,701 --> 00:29:43,876
The symptoms are the effort of the organism to cure itself.

176
00:29:48,332 --> 00:29:55,717
Imagine that there is an immune system behind the organism

177
00:29:55,917 --> 00:30:06,137
which is stimulated by the bacteria, virus and in its effort the organism produces

178
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:13,401
fever, headaches, pains, inflammation etc.

179
00:30:13,601 --> 00:30:28,223
So what we observe in the organism is its effort to cure itself.

180
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:35,002
Is this logical? Do you understand it?

181
00:30:35,202 --> 00:30:45,251
Is anybody who says no I don't believe it? Symptoms are accidental?

182
00:30:45,451 --> 00:30:55,979
Symptoms are organized by an intelligence in such a way as to counteract

183
00:30:56,179 --> 00:31:02,967
all the imbalances, electrochemical reactions which are happening in the

184
00:31:03,167 --> 00:31:14,119
organism under attack. The defense of the organism is the manifestation...

185
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:21,638
How do we know that the organism is defending himself? By the symptoms.

186
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:43,478
The fever is necessary. Streptococcus needs in order to die to bring the heat

187
00:31:43,678 --> 00:31:52,735
of the body more than 38.8 C. sometimes 39 or 40C.

188
00:31:52,935 --> 00:32:00,558
And then it is extinguishing the microbes.

189
00:32:00,758 --> 00:03:46,600
But now the fever comes down, as the culture of the microbes in the organism

190
00:03:46,800 --> 00:32:18,907
has died most of it, the fever comes down.

191
00:32:19,107 --> 00:32:25,691
As the organism becomes cold again there are some guys which have remained

192
00:32:25,891 --> 00:32:32,779
alive and they start multiplying again and start multiplying quite fast.

193
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:52,018
Next day you observe the fever is quite high, the organism has to go 38.9 or 39.3 C.

194
00:32:52,218 --> 00:33:05,511
The 3rd day if the organism is sensitive towards the attack of particular bacteria

195
00:33:05,711 --> 00:33:14,473
is going to be 40 C and then it becomes dangerous and then we have different

196
00:33:14,673 --> 00:33:19,747
kinds of other phenomena.

197
00:33:19,947 --> 00:33:23,622
But definitely what the organism is producing is for his defense,

198
00:33:23,822 --> 00:33:26,953
otherwise he will die.

199
00:33:27,153 --> 00:33:34,886
If you can imagine that a microbe comes into the organism

200
00:33:35,086 --> 00:33:45,189
and the organism does not react, the body will be eaten up,

201
00:33:45,389 --> 00:33:51,626
he will just dissolve after a few days, eaten up by the microbes.

202
00:33:53,950 --> 00:34:01,236
The organism must react, there is a danger,how? By symptoms.

203
00:34:02,942 --> 00:34:11,079
So all the symptoms are the means through which the organism defends itself.

204
00:34:11,279 --> 00:34:14,411
You have to be very careful here.

205
00:34:14,611 --> 00:34:25,704
Unless you understand this point you will never understand how it works.

206
00:34:29,502 --> 00:34:38,357
What is best? To suppress the symptoms, because there is high fever,

207
00:34:38,557 --> 00:34:48,477
anti-fever remedies, there are tremendous headaches, some painkillers and

208
00:34:48,677 --> 00:34:57,775
at the same time there are some affected joints, anti-inflammatory drugs

209
00:34:57,975 --> 00:35:03,741
to be allopathically treated, to suppress all this reaction of the organism.

210
00:35:03,941 --> 00:35:09,315
As a result there are side effects etc. and the disease is going bad.

211
00:35:09,515 --> 00:35:20,521
What is the best way to do it? If you give a stronger drug, this suppresses it.

212
00:35:20,721 --> 00:35:24,436
What is the best way to do it?

213
00:35:38,227 --> 00:35:44,853
You take a case of chronic headaches or menstrual problems,

214
00:35:45,053 --> 00:35:58,703
severe abdominal pains together with vomiting, all kind of symptoms...

215
00:36:10,758 --> 00:36:18,179
Twice a week I have a headache, I go to bed for one day and I am finished.

216
00:36:18,379 --> 00:36:33,429
And then next week again, 4-5 days I'm alright...

217
00:36:37,033 --> 00:36:45,301
This indicates that the organism is not balanced. Something is going wrong.

218
00:36:45,501 --> 00:37:00,375
The organism tries every time through these symptoms to cure itself.

219
00:37:00,575 --> 00:37:10,495
It's making an effort and then it gives up. I don't have enough energy,

220
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:19,932
ammunition, means to bring about a total cure.

221
00:37:20,132 --> 00:37:28,887
Next month another crisis and then again another crisis...

222
00:37:29,087 --> 00:37:40,105
Imagine this organism that through such symptoms tries to cure itself.

223
00:37:40,305 --> 00:37:49,074
But every time fails to bring about a final cure.

224
00:37:49,274 --> 00:38:00,968
We come and we take the symptoms and we base our prescription

225
00:38:01,168 --> 00:38:13,422
on the symptoms trying to fit the remedy to the symptoms.

226
00:38:13,622 --> 00:38:23,057
To make the remedy as similar as possible to the symptoms of the organism.

227
00:38:23,257 --> 00:38:26,280
And then we give the remedy.

228
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:37,960
Somebody who is logical will say, if you give a remedy that you know it produces

229
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:48,151
the symptoms of your patient, you will kill him because you will augment,

230
00:38:48,351 --> 00:38:51,638
you will increase his symptoms.

231
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:58,547
If the disease produces some symptoms and you found a way to give a remedy

232
00:38:58,747 --> 00:39:03,742
that has similar symptoms, you give the remedy and you produce

233
00:39:03,942 --> 00:39:08,903
a tremendous aggravation that may kill the patient.

234
00:39:12,706 --> 00:39:25,420
This is what Hahnemann was doing. He gave doses 1X, 2X repeatedly

235
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:38,794
but these were similar remedies so the aggravations he produced were

236
00:39:38,994 --> 00:39:41,817
quite frightening.

237
00:39:42,017 --> 00:39:49,605
So he tried to cure and almost killed the patient.

238
00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:59,886
So he says wait a moment I will reduce the dose to 1/10 and then again

239
00:40:00,086 --> 00:40:08,587
so 2X or 3X, again he saw aggravations.

240
00:40:08,787 --> 00:40:15,601
Then he reduced more and more until he reaches in the later years

241
00:40:15,801 --> 00:40:31,370
the idea of potentization and also the constant reducing of the material

242
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:35,129
of the remedy he was giving.

243
00:40:35,329 --> 00:40:51,750
As far as strength was concerned this was a weaker and weaker similar disease

244
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,625
he was giving.

245
00:40:54,825 --> 00:41:02,728
Why when he gave 1X-3X he saw the aggravation and he was feeling

246
00:41:02,928 --> 00:41:07,198
he will kill the patient?

247
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:16,310
So himself later on, he will write all this and you will read it, he said when I gave

248
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:27,477
these low potencies, I saw aggravations... and then I reduced the material dose.

249
00:41:27,677 --> 00:41:39,496
That means by reducing the material dose, he made the new disease weaker

250
00:41:39,696 --> 00:41:46,945
but this weaker disease was better acting.

251
00:41:49,653 --> 00:41:57,594
I have given you all the facts for you to understand what has happened.

252
00:41:57,794 --> 00:42:05,421
What is the explanation of the cure of a patient with a similar remedy?

253
00:42:05,621 --> 00:42:11,659
Can anybody tell me?

254
00:42:42,804 --> 00:42:52,581
-I know from your explanation, the remedy because it is similar to the disease

255
00:42:52,781 --> 00:42:57,392
produces an aggravation in the sick patient and that stimulates

256
00:42:57,592 --> 00:43:05,460
the defense mechanism and causes a healing reaction...

257
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:08,948
-But why stimulates in the healing reaction?

258
00:43:09,148 --> 00:43:11,515
-Because it produces an aggravation...

259
00:43:11,715 --> 00:43:14,084
-And why it produces an aggravation?

260
00:43:14,284 --> 00:43:18,720
-Because it is similar.

261
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:26,541
-Because it can produce a similar reaction to the organism.

262
00:43:26,741 --> 00:43:30,806
We make a proving and then we write down the symptoms.

263
00:43:31,006 --> 00:43:37,067
Then the disease comes and we say this disease looks like Belladonna.

264
00:43:37,267 --> 00:43:44,980
Because we have tried to see what Bell. could do, if stimulated

265
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:54,891
the defense mechanism. If you drink drops of Bell. 1X, which is a poison

266
00:43:55,091 --> 00:44:04,152
and there are some poisoning cases of Bell., the symptomatology is similar.

267
00:44:11,169 --> 00:44:19,994
What you are actually doing is by giving the homeopathic remedy

268
00:44:20,194 --> 00:44:29,567
not only you do not suppress, that means I give you a stronger and annihilates.

269
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:36,948
No, on the contrary you give the remedy, you increase the symptoms first.

270
00:44:38,732 --> 00:44:46,529
That is why we have the initial aggravation and we say very good.

271
00:44:46,729 --> 00:44:52,993
When we see the initial aggravation, that means we have hit the remedy exactly

272
00:44:53,193 --> 00:44:58,457
and the organism is in a good condition to produce a reaction,

273
00:44:58,657 --> 00:45:02,880
to increase the symptoms.

274
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:13,464
It was needed that the organism is stimulated, as if it was given extra force

275
00:45:13,664 --> 00:45:19,588
to produce this aggravation... you will see aggravations in chronic headaches

276
00:45:19,788 --> 00:45:22,535
which are terrible.

277
00:45:22,735 --> 00:45:29,509
Patients will say I never felt so bad in my life, for two days I was lying in bed

278
00:45:29,709 --> 00:45:44,005
with headaches... It means that the mechanism is exactly opposite than

279
00:45:44,205 --> 00:45:52,544
what it is explained here by Hahnemann.

280
00:45:52,744 --> 00:46:01,719
The remedy increases the reaction of the organism by giving the extra force

281
00:46:01,919 --> 00:46:18,768
which is missing in its natural state and therefore cannot have an explosion,

282
00:46:18,968 --> 00:46:25,619
an aggravation, a healing crisis.

283
00:46:25,819 --> 00:46:28,793
A healing crisis is nothing else but this phenomenon.

284
00:46:28,993 --> 00:46:37,009
You give a similar remedy, produce a tremendous aggravation

285
00:46:37,209 --> 00:46:42,369
and then the cure comes.

286
00:46:45,607 --> 00:47:01,399
But if you give a stronger remedy, you may suppress even with a similar remedy

287
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:07,663
you may suppress some symptoms.

288
00:47:07,863 --> 00:47:18,708
If you give a remedy, which is similar to a portion of the totality,

289
00:47:18,908 --> 00:47:26,807
not the Similimum, just similar, you can suppress with the homeopathic remedy.

290
00:47:27,007 --> 00:47:32,431
In which case would happen what he thinks and says here...

291
00:47:32,631 --> 00:47:37,228
A partial suppression may take place.

292
00:47:37,428 --> 00:47:45,881
For instance you have a case with headaches on the right side.

293
00:47:46,081 --> 00:47:52,524
You give Chelidomium but Chel. is not really indicated in the whole

294
00:47:52,724 --> 00:47:57,069
but it covers this local symptom. It is going to suppress this.

295
00:47:57,269 --> 00:48:04,361
It is going to take away the headache on the right side.

296
00:48:04,561 --> 00:48:09,975
For one month there is no headache, next month the headache appears

297
00:48:10,175 --> 00:48:15,241
on the left side.

298
00:48:16,946 --> 00:48:32,065
If that was true, then we could suppress all the time and we do suppress

299
00:48:32,265 --> 00:48:34,080
by the wrong remedy but not entirely wrong.

300
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:39,714
If it is entirely wrong, it will do nothing. But if it is similar, it may suppress.

301
00:48:39,914 --> 00:48:54,852
Then this can happen. Do you understand the process? Is it clear?

302
00:48:57,085 --> 00:48:59,177
Helen, don't monopolize the ...

303
00:48:59,377 --> 00:49:15,011
-But I had a question like 10 minutes ago. To me this is the most difficult part...

304
00:49:15,211 --> 00:49:25,144
of homeopathy. What is a disease? Disease is not the symptoms, right?

305
00:49:25,344 --> 00:49:31,771
Not all the symptoms are produced by the body to fight the pathogen.

306
00:49:31,971 --> 00:49:40,390
Some of the symptoms are produced by the pathogen itself.

307
00:49:41,825 --> 00:50:01,595
-No, I will explain it to you. I will give you an example so you may understand.

308
00:50:05,275 --> 00:50:19,727
When you have an influenza, the symptoms of the disease are

309
00:50:19,927 --> 00:50:26,741
the high temperature and also the pain in the bones.

310
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:31,045
All else is something else.

311
00:50:37,866 --> 00:50:49,697
You cannot say that this is due to the disease and these symptoms are due

312
00:50:49,897 --> 00:50:56,015
to something else. Everything is due to the disease.

313
00:50:56,215 --> 00:51:06,808
But the disease is nothing else, as we can understand it, but the manifestation

314
00:51:07,008 --> 00:51:15,688
of symptomatology. This is representing the manifestation, the externalization

315
00:51:15,888 --> 00:51:21,814
so we perceive it of the imbalance.

316
00:51:22,014 --> 00:51:28,861
You may call it imbalance, disease, dysfunction...

317
00:51:29,061 --> 00:51:38,897
By disease you may think only of microbes or bacteria, it's not only that.

318
00:51:39,097 --> 00:51:44,710
It can be stress, it can be anything.

319
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:56,219
The stress produces a host of symptoms that can remain as a chronic condition.

320
00:51:56,419 --> 00:52:09,508
That means the organism is like encoding. In order to counteract the fact

321
00:52:09,708 --> 00:52:28,061
that I lost my job, I produce a state of panic attacks, depression, anxiety.

322
00:52:28,261 --> 00:52:33,788
So this is the defense of my organism in order to survive.

323
00:52:33,988 --> 00:52:44,784
Otherwise I have to kill myself. All these symptoms are to prevent us from dying.

324
00:52:44,984 --> 00:52:55,042
This is our defense. Now because I have encoded in me that because I do not

325
00:52:55,242 --> 00:53:06,274
have the job, I must have (the organism decides) anxiety and confusion and

326
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:12,791
I lose some of my memory and a host of symptoms.

327
00:53:12,991 --> 00:53:17,648
If the organism has decided to have these symptoms,

328
00:53:17,848 --> 00:53:26,302
they will repeat themselves again and again because through this

329
00:53:26,502 --> 00:53:30,835
the organism tries to cure itself.

330
00:53:31,035 --> 00:53:34,245
I will give another example.

331
00:53:34,445 --> 00:53:42,781
If you lose a beloved person, what is the first natural reaction?

332
00:53:42,981 --> 00:53:56,665
You cry, you weep one, two, three days... What is this weeping for?

333
00:53:56,865 --> 00:54:07,317
It is to get rid of the sadness and the deep sorrow and the pain inside.

334
00:54:07,517 --> 00:54:18,010
And you weep one month, two months, three, four, five months...

335
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:28,125
even a big loss is controlled. Why? Because the organism is healthy

336
00:54:28,325 --> 00:54:33,594
and allowed you to react in the best possible way.

337
00:54:33,794 --> 00:54:41,652
Take now another organism who is not so healthy. What will he do?

338
00:54:41,852 --> 00:54:51,482
He says I lost my mother whom I loved very much but I could not cry.

339
00:54:51,682 --> 00:55:00,818
I felt this stricture here but I could not cry.

340
00:55:01,018 --> 00:55:09,767
He comes 3 years after the death of his mother and he gives you the symptoms

341
00:55:09,967 --> 00:55:19,021
of his stress and you say Ok take Nat-m. and the whole thing is solved.

342
00:55:19,221 --> 00:55:30,175
Because you know the constriction and the sadness... and the picture fits.

343
00:55:30,375 --> 00:55:35,517
How much salt you take? I started taking a lot of salt. Why?

344
00:55:35,717 --> 00:55:45,550
Because the chemistry of the body has been unbalanced and now the Natrum

345
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:55,060
which is needed to nourish the nervous system is not enough.

346
00:55:55,260 --> 00:56:04,977
Because of the imbalance the salt I take is not absorbed, so I don't have

347
00:56:05,177 --> 00:56:20,669
enough salt. Sometimes I take salt and I eat it to complete the loss.

348
00:56:20,869 --> 00:56:31,324
This imbalance, how you bring it back? By giving a remedy which has produced

349
00:56:31,524 --> 00:56:35,432
similar symptoms.

350
00:56:35,632 --> 00:56:43,302
That means the person that you give Nat-m. in such a case

351
00:56:43,502 --> 00:56:49,920
what is the most natural reaction that he will have?

352
00:56:50,128 --> 00:56:55,812
If he was having headaches, he will have strong headaches and the next thing

353
00:56:56,012 --> 00:57:07,638
is, he will break out into crying after 3 years for 2-3 days.

354
00:57:07,838 --> 00:57:23,681
That will be the 'lysis' of the problem. Because you stimulated the organism

355
00:57:23,881 --> 00:57:30,462
with similar symptoms, with a remedy that produces similar symptoms,

356
00:57:30,662 --> 00:57:35,903
you brought out the aggravation and then the 'lysis'.

357
00:57:45,377 --> 00:57:49,051
The fact that he does not give an explanation of how the remedy works,

358
00:57:49,987 --> 00:58:01,595
it does not mean anything, neither anything is lost from his genius.

359
00:58:03,601 --> 00:58:10,306
But we have to look upon and to understand what we are reading and

360
00:58:10,506 --> 00:58:19,312
that's why you are here, to hear the explanation. You want to speak.

361
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:30,169
-I wanted to ask... you said I think in this paragraph that Hahnemann says

362
00:58:30,369 --> 00:58:38,037
in the beginning by giving low potencies or remedies close to their crude form,

363
00:58:38,237 --> 00:58:43,313
he brought about strong aggravations almost killing the patient.

364
00:58:43,513 --> 00:58:49,275
And I remember this in several paragraphs in the Organon.

365
00:58:49,475 --> 00:58:52,869
He said you have to potentize, to raise potency.

366
00:58:53,069 --> 00:58:57,800
We know that actually if we increase the potency, especially in severely

367
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,793
sick patients, then we can bring about severe aggravations.

368
00:59:02,993 --> 00:59:09,917
That's why we give low potencies. These two things are opposite. That's the question.

369
00:59:10,117 --> 00:59:17,183
-That is correct. Later on we will see that what Hahnemann meant

370
00:59:17,383 --> 00:59:23,241
by aggravation is totally different than what we mean by aggravation

371
00:59:23,441 --> 00:59:27,726
when we say from high potency.

372
00:59:39,605 --> 00:59:41,756
I think you understand this.

373
00:59:44,341 --> 00:59:50,721
Now if you ask, why we give 200CH, it lasts only for 3 months and then

374
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:57,190
there is a relapse and then you give 1M and the amelioration lasts for 6 months

375
00:59:57,390 --> 01:00:02,254
and then back... Finally you give 10M and it goes away.

376
01:00:02,454 --> 01:00:13,078
This is the potency, the force with which you have to stimulate the vital force,

377
01:00:13,278 --> 01:00:19,062
the energy of the body it needs a great force to react.

378
01:00:19,262 --> 01:00:34,005
It is like somebody who has something which is heavy, under this heaviness

379
01:00:34,205 --> 01:00:42,218
he throws some things and then they come back. They don't go...

380
01:00:42,418 --> 01:00:56,052
Until he goes so nervous and throws away with great force,

381
01:00:56,252 --> 01:00:59,502
then they never come back.

382
01:01:02,237 --> 01:01:15,838
It is an idea which I brought into Homeopathy and later on I remember

383
01:01:16,038 --> 01:01:22,553
I was talking with an American. He was writing this idea.

384
01:01:22,753 --> 01:01:28,037
I said yes but you don't mention that I have brought this idea.

385
01:01:28,237 --> 01:01:35,690
He said you brought the idea? This is common sense.

386
01:01:42,871 --> 01:01:47,504
It's common sense but nobody knows until I have explained it.

387
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:53,365
After that it's common sense.

388
01:01:59,353 --> 01:02:05,224
-I wouldn't like to open a debate that could maybe not finished until the end

389
01:02:05,424 --> 01:02:11,471
of the night but I think we cannot doubt that Hahnemann noticed that

390
01:02:13,231 --> 01:02:20,961
the final effect of a given dose is stimulating the defense mechanism.

391
01:02:21,161 --> 01:02:27,426
But he has a few problems to answer the question how it works.

392
01:02:27,626 --> 01:02:33,646
Because we observe the facts and we have maybe to put a theory

393
01:02:33,846 --> 01:02:36,972
despite the fact that Hahnemann agrees that we don't need any theories.

394
01:02:37,172 --> 01:02:43,491
I would like to go back to the paragraph 1 and especially not forget the

395
01:02:43,691 --> 01:02:50,572
aphorism 9 in which he says that when there is health, it means that the vital force

396
01:02:50,772 --> 01:02:57,685
is undisturbed and the disease is only a mistuning of the vital force.

397
01:02:57,885 --> 01:03:08,890
And in paragraph 1 he says, I summarize a little bit, our goal is to cure sick people

398
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:20,203
and that biology does not obey the same laws than in organic matter.

399
01:03:20,403 --> 01:03:27,588
And he says that we'll never be clever enough to understand what are

400
01:03:27,788 --> 01:03:32,160
the mechanisms of life, of disease and so on.

401
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:38,833
Putting all these items together, he says that there is a fact, certainly inside

402
01:03:39,033 --> 01:03:44,228
the vital force is mistuned and the only way we have to know that is by

403
01:03:44,428 --> 01:03:50,498
the symptoms that we can notice.

404
01:03:50,698 --> 01:03:55,879
To cure we have to explore the properties of every disease, of every

405
01:03:56,079 --> 01:04:01,282
artificial disease, which we call remedies, in the way that we cannot

406
01:04:01,482 --> 01:04:06,821
understand the way of the mistuning of the organism.

407
01:04:07,021 --> 01:04:10,795
This is characterized by the set of symptoms.

408
01:04:10,995 --> 01:04:18,014
So coming back to his own explanations, it's only a force that can act on a force.

409
01:04:28,938 --> 01:04:35,476
Exactly like the geometry in mathematics. We have the direction and the intensity.

410
01:04:35,676 --> 01:04:40,097
When you give the remedy, we can assume it's a kind of force acting on

411
01:04:40,297 --> 01:04:48,578
the vital force and we understand that the only way to have after the action

412
01:04:48,778 --> 01:04:54,218
the reaction of the body we have to stimulate it by a stronger force.

413
01:04:56,301 --> 01:05:04,774
-That's correct. What you are saying is that the vital force which is

414
01:05:04,974 --> 01:05:15,369
the central intelligence of the body decides what to do, always.

415
01:05:15,569 --> 01:05:21,078
What kind of reaction will be there will be decided by the vital force

416
01:05:21,278 --> 01:05:24,276
which is behind all the mechanisms.

417
01:05:24,476 --> 01:05:31,440
We call it immune system, reticuloendothelial system, hormonal system...

418
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:41,226
all these are the conglomeration of defenses of the human body.

419
01:05:41,426 --> 01:05:49,454
All these are regulated by an intelligence which is behind all that system.

420
01:05:49,654 --> 01:06:03,770
And that system decides how much will raise the hormones, how much will raise

421
01:06:03,970 --> 01:06:17,397
the red blood cells, the white cells... it is an immensely complicated system

422
01:06:17,597 --> 01:06:24,977
that I think nobody can ever understand how it is regulated.

423
01:06:25,177 --> 01:06:32,815
But what we can only know is the manifested effect, which are the symptoms.

424
01:06:34,965 --> 01:06:40,007
Sometimes we can understand the physiopathology of a symptom

425
01:06:40,207 --> 01:06:44,790
but not all symptoms. Never.

426
01:06:47,292 --> 01:06:52,289
-In the last example you say to give to the patient Nat-m.

427
01:06:52,489 --> 01:06:56,898
But I have to ask you why not Ign.?

428
01:06:57,098 --> 01:07:07,970
-Why not Ph-ac., Lach. also? I just brought it as an example.

429
01:07:09,367 --> 01:07:20,557
-Because Hahnemann in paragraph 210 he distinguishes mental diseases

430
01:07:20,757 --> 01:07:28,975
and he said to treat mental diseases like an acute and then we have to give

431
01:07:29,175 --> 01:07:32,467
the antipsoric.

432
01:07:32,667 --> 01:07:37,783
Before we treat with an acute remedy and then with an antipsoric.

433
01:07:37,983 --> 01:07:43,446
My question is about the method that you use...

434
01:07:45,542 --> 01:07:52,995
-A mental remedy, a remedy that has more mental effect.

435
01:07:53,195 --> 01:07:58,218
Why I did not say Ignatia and I said Natrum muriaticum?

436
01:07:58,418 --> 01:08:07,698
Nat-m. has also emotional and mental symptoms, as well as Ignatia.

437
01:08:07,898 --> 01:08:19,760
There are differential symptoms that separate Ign. from Nat-m.

438
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:26,812
But when I gave an example and I said Nat-m. is just... You don't always

439
01:08:27,012 --> 01:08:29,938
give Nat-m.

440
01:08:30,138 --> 01:08:35,927
Most of the times you give Ign., as you say.

441
01:08:36,127 --> 01:08:44,890
If I say always give Ign., all will give Ignatia forgetting that some cases

442
01:08:45,090 --> 01:08:57,508
are going to be Nat-m. or Staph. with similar symptoms.

443
01:08:57,708 --> 01:09:22,498
-My question was because Ign. is not an antipsoric remedy and Nat-m. is antipsoric...

444
01:09:22,698 --> 01:09:26,766
-Who told you that?

445
01:09:26,966 --> 01:09:35,251
-Hahnemann puts Ignatia in Materia Medica Pura and Nat-m. in the chronic diseases.

446
01:09:35,451 --> 01:09:40,524
-No. That has nothing to do with psoric and syphilitic...

447
01:09:40,724 --> 01:09:46,804
If there are Ign. symptoms you have to prescribe Ign.

448
01:09:47,004 --> 01:09:53,240
You cannot say that I think this person needs a psoric remedy.

449
01:09:53,440 --> 01:10:01,465
Therefore I do not give Ign. because it is not a psoric remedy. I will give Nat-m.

450
01:10:01,665 --> 01:10:06,748
You must not say that. Because if you do, you will make mistakes.

451
01:10:06,948 --> 01:10:14,038
So forget about the idea of miasms when you prescribe a remedy.

452
01:10:14,238 --> 01:10:23,497
A remedy is needed when their symptomatology is on the patient.

453
01:10:23,697 --> 01:10:29,467
That's a rule that if you don't follow, you will go wrong.

454
01:10:29,667 --> 01:10:35,602
Because you feel this is a syphilitic patient.

455
01:10:35,802 --> 01:10:41,948
Because his teeth is like that and because his face is like this...

456
01:10:42,148 --> 01:10:48,422
and because he is washing his hands frequently and because he is spending

457
01:10:48,622 --> 01:10:53,317
a lot of money for nothing.

458
01:10:53,517 --> 01:10:59,880
When he comes to me and he gives me symptoms of Lach., I will give him Lach.

459
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:09,585
Ignoring the fact... I can see the syphilitic symptoms, not giving Syphilinum

460
01:11:09,785 --> 01:11:15,865
because of that or Mercury or any purely syphilitic remedy.

461
01:11:16,065 --> 01:11:24,279
Until after a year or 2 or 3 during the treatment, he will manifest symptoms

462
01:11:24,479 --> 01:11:33,535
of Merc. or Syph. But when he comes and has symptoms of Lach., I will give Lach.

463
01:11:33,735 --> 01:11:37,879
When he comes and has symptoms of Med., I will give him Med.

464
01:11:38,079 --> 01:11:46,738
He is syphilitic why you give Med? Because he has Med. symptoms.

465
01:11:46,938 --> 01:11:51,368
You have to be careful with that because there is such a misunderstanding

466
01:11:51,568 --> 01:11:56,100
in these matters and people are teaching others the wrong way.

467
01:11:56,300 --> 01:12:03,664
It's a pity that Homeopathy which can be so effective is not effective because

468
01:12:03,864 --> 01:12:10,031
of wrong teachings and misunderstandings of what Hahnemann said

469
01:12:14,584 --> 01:12:25,582
and what can actually this healing method do. It's a great pity.

470
01:12:25,782 --> 01:12:40,263
Anyhow it was explained properly? I see in some of your eyes some elements

471
01:12:40,463 --> 01:12:44,837
of not comprehending what I have said.

472
01:12:45,037 --> 01:12:51,473
This is something which either you understand or you don't understand.

473
01:12:55,373 --> 01:13:00,606
Do not be afraid to say I do not understand, explain to me again.

474
01:13:01,378 --> 01:13:04,719
Because it is a basic idea.

475
01:13:04,919 --> 01:13:20,240
-What is difficult to understand is that Hahnemann was wrong, just to say it.

476
01:13:22,843 --> 01:13:33,410
-There is also possibility that he meant the force should be stronger,

477
01:13:33,610 --> 01:13:39,425
no matter what the material substance is. The dose doesn't matter.

478
01:13:39,625 --> 01:13:47,933
-Yes but ...does not occupy the place... He gives his own explanation.

479
01:13:48,133 --> 01:13:51,694
His understanding is such that the new disease occupies the places of the older

480
01:13:51,894 --> 01:13:56,578
similar and extinguishes because it occupies the place...

481
01:13:56,778 --> 01:14:00,166
All this kind of explanation for somebody who reads it, will not understand it.

482
01:14:00,366 --> 01:14:14,661
I am sure. When I was reading... I read the Organon in 1960.

483
01:14:26,589 --> 01:14:32,527
I read this book and I can tell you I've never read it again

484
01:14:32,727 --> 01:14:38,861
and I am just reading it again now after 50 years.

485
01:14:40,035 --> 01:14:51,607
But this book contains a treasure of medicine. For those who understand it.

486
01:14:51,807 --> 01:14:59,461
The fact that I analyze this paragraph and I say maybe he has a misunderstanding

487
01:14:59,661 --> 01:15:09,689
is nothing. Why we should make a religion out of that saying this is the Bible?

488
01:15:09,889 --> 01:15:20,632
It's more than a treasure because you will see later on the ideas

489
01:15:20,832 --> 01:15:24,546
which are produced, they are unbelievable.

490
01:15:26,098 --> 01:15:32,420
-I understand what you are saying when we give one remedy and what happens

491
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:41,133
but what we just read now in nature when two similar diseases meet

492
01:15:41,333 --> 01:15:44,660
(aphorism 45) what exactly happens?

493
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:48,924
Because when he says that nature, when he is giving the example of smallpox

494
01:15:49,124 --> 01:15:56,478
and cowpox, one goes away but what happens to the other one

495
01:15:56,678 --> 01:16:03,679
I am not able to understand. Although we don't see it today, what do you think?

496
01:16:03,879 --> 01:16:10,590
-First of all today we don't have the experience he was having but I think

497
01:16:10,790 --> 01:16:17,014
the same thing happens.

498
01:16:17,214 --> 01:16:21,620
Maybe he did not notice the initial aggravation.

499
01:16:21,906 --> 01:16:35,937
If the two diseases met, he did not notice or has not been told to him that

500
01:16:36,137 --> 01:16:47,282
on the first day there was an aggravation when the two similar diseases met.

501
01:16:47,482 --> 01:16:56,972
That means the defense mechanism, the vital force was mobilized and got rid

502
01:16:57,172 --> 01:17:02,552
with a crisis. This is my explanation.

503
01:17:02,752 --> 01:17:10,719
This was a good question because I've never thought, I just understand it now.

504
01:17:15,249 --> 01:17:23,838
Another paragraph? Ok, another paragraph.

505
01:17:34,946 --> 01:17:46,060
The other paragraph is not so interesting. He gives some examples of which

506
01:17:46,260 --> 01:17:56,433
we are not knowing today. And he mentions the authors of the different examples

507
01:17:56,633 --> 01:18:05,635
that he gives. It's quite a huge paragraph, if I read it all it will take half an hour.

508
01:18:05,835 --> 01:18:16,068
As I read very slowly but the understanding is that he gives...

509
01:18:22,338 --> 01:18:31,783
"The measles bear a strong resemblance in the character of its fever and cough

510
01:18:31,983 --> 01:18:42,043
to the whooping-cough, and hence it was that Bosquillon noticed,

511
01:18:42,243 --> 01:18:52,031
in an epidemic where both these affections prevailed, that many children

512
01:18:52,231 --> 01:19:00,819
who then took measles remained free from whooping-cough during that epidemic.

513
01:19:01,019 --> 01:19:09,932
They would all have been protected from, and rendered incapable of being infected

514
01:19:10,132 --> 01:19:20,210
by the whooping-cough in that and all subsequent epidemics, by the measles,

515
01:19:20,410 --> 01:19:28,216
if the whooping-cough were not a disease that has only a partial similarity to

516
01:19:28,416 --> 01:19:36,892
the measles, that is to say, if it had also a cutaneous eruption similar to what

517
01:19:37,092 --> 01:19:45,061
the latter possesses. As it is, however, the measles can but preserve

518
01:19:45,261 --> 01:19:54,120
a large number from whooping-cough homeopathically, and that only in the

519
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:58,950
epidemic prevailing at the time."

520
01:19:59,150 --> 01:20:07,351
This is not exactly the right example but anyhow let's have another word.

521
01:20:07,551 --> 01:20:17,317
"Smallpox coming on after vaccination, as well on account of its greater strength

522
01:20:17,517 --> 01:20:21,346
as its great similarity..." let's find another example.

523
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:31,878
"How often does smallpox cause deafness and dyspnea!

524
01:20:32,078 --> 01:20:42,369
And both these chronic diseases it removed on reaching its acme,

525
01:20:42,569 --> 01:20:47,285
as J. Fr. Closs observed."

526
01:20:49,338 --> 01:21:00,010
The example he gives is not in favor of his explanation.

527
01:21:00,210 --> 01:21:18,967
Smallpox affected the deafness which was there and dyspnea.

528
01:21:19,167 --> 01:21:27,638
"And both these chronic diseases it removed on reaching its acme".

529
01:21:27,838 --> 01:21:38,417
But what was happening is that smallpox is primarily a disease which manifests

530
01:21:38,617 --> 01:21:52,972
on the skin. Therefore the deafness which was there as a chronic condition

531
01:21:53,172 --> 01:21:59,630
and dyspnea through the manifestation of an eruption on the skin

532
01:21:59,830 --> 01:22:06,173
were ameliorated. This is not a similar or dissimilar disease.

533
01:22:06,373 --> 01:22:20,885
It's a matter of manifestation of the problem on the skin level, so strong,

534
01:22:21,085 --> 01:22:29,610
that internal diseases are cured as we all know to happen.

535
01:22:29,810 --> 01:22:35,108
When we give a remedy and then a manifestation on the skin takes place,

536
01:22:35,308 --> 01:22:45,414
we say "very good" because it cures the internal problem.

537
01:22:45,614 --> 01:22:53,667
This is a weak point for Hahnemann but it doesn't matter, we don't have to stick

538
01:22:53,867 --> 01:22:54,946
very much to this, neither here to what he says ...

539
01:22:55,146 --> 01:23:04,798
measles bear a strong resemblance to whooping-cough...

540
01:23:04,998 --> 01:23:11,382
Paragraph 47, "Nothing could teach the physician in a plainer and more

541
01:23:11,582 --> 01:23:24,587
convincing manner than the above what kind of artificial morbific agent (medicine)

542
01:23:24,787 --> 01:23:32,319
he ought to choose in order to cure in a sure, rapid and permanent manner,

543
01:23:32,519 --> 01:23:48,398
conformably with the process that takes place in nature."

544
01:23:48,598 --> 01:24:04,598
All his argument is to say that the only correct means to use in treating diseases

545
01:24:04,798 --> 01:24:09,268
is the similar remedy.

546
01:24:09,468 --> 01:24:17,522
Paragraph 48, "Neither in the course of nature, as we see from all the above

547
01:24:17,722 --> 01:24:27,222
examples, nor by the physician's art, can an existing affection or malady

548
01:24:27,422 --> 01:24:36,886
in any one instance be removed by a dissimilar morbific agent, be it ever so strong,

549
01:24:37,086 --> 01:24:46,990
but solely by one that is similar in symptoms and is somewhat stronger,

550
01:24:47,190 --> 01:24:54,425
according to eternal, irrevocable laws of nature, which have not hitherto

551
01:24:54,625 --> 01:25:02,865
been recognized." This is clear.

552
01:25:08,595 --> 01:25:15,069
Paragraph 49, "We should have been able to meet with many more real,

553
01:25:15,269 --> 01:25:22,200
natural homoeopathic cures of this kind if, on the one hand, the attention of

554
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:29,479
Observers had been more directed to them, and, on the other hand,

555
01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:38,547
if nature had not been so deficient in helpful homoeopathic diseases."

556
01:25:38,747 --> 01:25:46,988
What he says is actually what I said before. He says it was through observation

557
01:25:47,188 --> 01:25:56,784
which was missed all along with any other physician that they did not find out

558
01:25:56,984 --> 01:26:01,222
how nature cures.

559
01:26:01,422 --> 01:26:11,486
It was due to my observations that I found out this law and this could have been

560
01:26:11,686 --> 01:26:20,513
much more obvious if we could have much more examples.

561
01:26:20,713 --> 01:26:30,697
As I said today we cannot find any examples but during their time the diseases

562
01:26:30,897 --> 01:26:38,950
were plain at the moment, were much more free to do whatever they like

563
01:26:39,150 --> 01:26:42,320
with the human organism.

564
01:26:55,869 --> 01:27:04,631
I have talked too much in my life and my vocal cords are becoming less

565
01:27:04,831 --> 01:27:07,816
and less helpful.

566
01:27:12,513 --> 01:27:20,574
Paragraph 50, "Mighty Nature herself has..." You see the idea of Hahnemann...

567
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:34,287
He uses an expression "Mighty Nature". You see his perception of Nature.

568
01:27:34,487 --> 01:27:44,972
He understands what a wonderful thing Nature is. He wonders about Nature.

569
01:27:45,172 --> 01:27:55,604
He meditates upon the effects of Nature especially on diseases.

570
01:27:55,804 --> 01:28:05,061
"...herself has, as we see, at her command, as instruments for effecting

571
01:28:05,261 --> 01:28:21,966
homoeopathic cures, little besides the miasmatic diseases of constant character,

572
01:28:22,166 --> 01:28:29,172
(the itch) measles and smallpox, morbific agents which, as remedies, are either

573
01:28:29,372 --> 01:28:42,710
more dangerous to life and more to be dreaded than the disease they are to cure,

574
01:28:49,918 --> 01:29:00,181
they themselves require curing, in order to be eradicated in their turn

575
01:29:00,381 --> 01:29:07,117
- both circumstances that make their employment, as homoeopathic remedies,

576
01:29:07,317 --> 01:29:12,039
difficult, uncertain and dangerous..."

577
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:21,537
Well, he says it will be nice that we could give a disease for another but

578
01:29:21,737 --> 01:29:35,445
that would have been very dangerous. We cannot give one disease to cure another...

579
01:29:35,645 --> 01:29:44,198
I think you are tired and with all these we have to go to a lighter subject like the one

580
01:29:44,398 --> 01:29:50,363
we discussed in the morning.

581
01:29:52,495 --> 01:30:02,254
Those people who do not like to hear they have the permission to go...

582
01:30:02,454 --> 01:30:16,249
Somebody put the question and said what about concerning homosexuality?

583
01:30:16,449 --> 01:30:30,656
What about the old Greeks who practice a homosexual life?

584
01:30:30,856 --> 01:30:38,594
And what we know in countries where the contact between man and woman is

585
01:30:38,794 --> 01:30:48,925
very prohibited unless they have been in a marriage, the practice of homosexuality

586
01:30:49,125 --> 01:31:03,937
is also quite used. This is different than homosexuality.

587
01:31:04,137 --> 01:31:21,361
The fact that there are hormonal needs that need to have an outlet

588
01:31:21,561 --> 01:31:34,055
in the young age, the young people have a hormonal level quite high and they have

589
01:31:34,255 --> 01:31:40,909
to have an outlet for such a hormonal function.

590
01:31:41,109 --> 01:31:54,291
Therefore they practice primarily masturbation and as secondary outlet

591
01:31:54,491 --> 01:32:02,884
they find, especially if people are overcrowded, overpopulated or

592
01:32:03,084 --> 01:32:13,429
if there are boys staying together in one place like a hostel, you may get some

593
01:32:13,629 --> 01:32:19,878
incidental - what appears to be a - homosexuality. It's not homosexuality.

594
01:32:20,078 --> 01:32:29,643
It's an outlet of a hormonal excess that has to be detonated.

595
01:32:29,843 --> 01:32:41,058
These boys when they come in the correct age 21, 22 they get married and

596
01:32:41,258 --> 01:32:51,634
they are very active, as they tell me, when I was in India for instance.

597
01:32:51,834 --> 01:33:01,989
Indians are sexually very active people.

598
01:33:02,189 --> 01:33:09,662
There is no effect because they had some homosexual experiences in their

599
01:33:09,862 --> 01:33:20,554
young age. Of course, there might be some, especially of late, that because

600
01:33:20,754 --> 01:33:30,235
of predisposition they may continue to practice homosexuality.

601
01:33:30,435 --> 01:33:38,084
This is one part but homosexuality is a much more complicated issue that

602
01:33:38,284 --> 01:33:49,020
I don't want to go now and expand in all the different aspects of homosexuality.

603
01:33:50,647 --> 01:34:00,446
But what I said this morning is a part of an explanation for homosexuality.

604
01:34:00,646 --> 01:34:08,268
The ancient Greeks were like the Indians.

605
01:34:08,468 --> 01:34:17,174
I know because I have spoken a lot with Indian people while I was in India.

606
01:34:17,374 --> 01:34:26,380
I treated them, they explained to me, they told me exactly what was happening

607
01:34:26,580 --> 01:34:41,714
and this is my experience. So in countries like Pakistan, India, Arab countries

608
01:34:41,914 --> 01:34:51,379
maybe, Afghanistan maybe...

609
01:34:51,579 --> 01:35:10,838
On the other hand today there are people who don't feel any attraction

610
01:35:11,038 --> 01:35:20,968
for sexual act. That means the hormones are in a very low level.

611
01:35:21,168 --> 01:35:28,713
They feel no attraction, they have never felt an attraction and these people can

612
01:35:28,913 --> 01:35:36,838
end up going into a monastery. They're the most happy in a monastic life,

613
01:35:37,038 --> 01:35:48,560
devoting themselves to the cultivation of their spiritual part.

614
01:35:51,388 --> 01:36:01,624
But at the same time in monasteries end up some people who have been

615
01:36:01,824 --> 01:36:11,179
disappointed from life and they don't want to live anymore in this world.

616
01:36:11,379 --> 01:36:17,336
They feel it's very painful, so they leave and they go.

617
01:36:17,536 --> 01:36:28,956
These people who were having love affairs, who were sexually active,

618
01:36:29,156 --> 01:36:43,211
heterosexual (straight), they go to the monastery and there maybe some other

619
01:36:43,411 --> 01:36:48,671
things are happening... I don't want to go into details.

620
01:36:48,871 --> 01:36:55,526
The homosexuality that may develop after that it's a matter of conditions and

621
01:36:55,726 --> 01:37:07,084
surroundings and environmental factors that may lead or not...

622
01:37:07,284 --> 01:37:21,984
but what I say is that definitely the hormonal imbalance in an organism can dictate

623
01:37:22,184 --> 01:37:26,324
the sexual behavior of the individual.

624
01:37:26,524 --> 01:37:32,187
When they come to us and we give the homeopathic remedy,

625
01:37:32,387 --> 01:37:41,679
this balance comes back and the person behaves normally.

626
01:37:41,879 --> 01:37:54,544
As Helen remembers, when I was in Berkeley in California, I was treating a case of

627
01:37:54,744 --> 01:38:08,600
a woman 27 and during the consultation she told me "I am a lesbian".

628
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:17,339
I said to her then "you have to know that if I give you a remedy, you may become

629
01:38:17,539 --> 01:38:34,833
straight". She got angry, she said "What do you think? I am lesbian by choice.

630
01:38:35,033 --> 01:38:45,154
Close the circuit." The class was in another floor.

631
01:38:45,354 --> 01:38:51,866
I turned off the circuit and I explained to her.

632
01:38:52,066 --> 01:38:59,419
She said "Ok, I will take the treatment. Turn on the TV".

633
01:38:59,619 --> 01:39:06,661
I turned on the TV and I continued taking the case.

634
01:39:06,861 --> 01:39:15,570
And I go down to the class. What has happened in the class?

635
01:39:15,770 --> 01:39:26,705
When the girl said turn off the TV, on the receivers they were down,

636
01:39:26,905 --> 01:39:30,671
the people turned their receivers off but they didn't know after that,

637
01:39:30,871 --> 01:39:35,901
they had no communication that the case was continuing.

638
01:39:36,101 --> 01:39:45,467
So they remained with the TV turned off without knowing the continuation

639
01:39:45,667 --> 01:39:56,169
of the case. Then I go to the class and I see a very hostile class.

640
01:39:56,369 --> 01:40:05,738
I pretended I don't understand and I start explaining the case

641
01:40:05,938 --> 01:40:10,900
and why I wanted to give this remedy.

642
01:40:11,100 --> 01:40:22,130
Before 5 minutes one of them gets up and says I am offended because I am also

643
01:40:22,330 --> 01:40:31,667
a lesbian and with your behavior...and I leave. So she left.

644
01:40:31,867 --> 01:40:39,566
I pretended I am not influenced and I continued the analysis of the case.

645
01:40:39,766 --> 01:40:52,418
After another 5 minutes another one gets up and says I am also a lesbian, so I leave...

646
01:40:52,618 --> 01:40:56,311
I said to myself that something is wrong.

647
01:40:56,511 --> 01:41:05,675
I said to them "did you attend the continuation of the taking of the case?"

648
01:41:05,875 --> 01:41:12,144
They said no. Because we turned off the TV the moment she said to do so...

649
01:41:12,344 --> 01:41:16,367
And nobody knew what happened.

650
01:41:16,567 --> 01:41:28,109
The girl was so happy with the taking of the case, the explanation that she donated

651
01:41:28,309 --> 01:41:36,360
to the Clinic where I was teaching, a few thousand dollars by herself.

652
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:48,783
Just because she was so happy I took her case.

653
01:41:48,983 --> 01:41:56,350
Then I told them that I had to tell her because if she was lesbian by choice,

654
01:41:59,567 --> 01:42:09,696
she may not want to take the remedy. So I had to tell her.

655
01:42:09,896 --> 01:42:14,808
So I explained it and everybody was happy.

656
01:42:15,008 --> 01:42:25,709
2 months later she comes for a follow up and she says I am married with a man,

657
01:42:25,909 --> 01:42:36,749
not with a woman. "Are you happy? - Yes I am happy". This is the experience.

658
01:42:36,949 --> 01:42:45,864
Of course I had a shock. And like Helen, Roger Morrison said

659
01:42:46,064 --> 01:42:52,768
"George don't talk about homosexuality, because here it's a big issue."

660
01:42:52,968 --> 01:43:04,970
I said I don't criticize but I also say that these people born homosexuals

661
01:43:05,170 --> 01:43:10,370
cannot do otherwise because of their predisposition in which they have been

662
01:43:10,570 --> 01:43:19,438
born. You cannot blame them. But this is not the only group.

663
01:43:19,638 --> 01:43:32,594
There are several other groups that they do not have the excuse.

664
01:43:32,794 --> 01:43:39,939
I had other cases, they had confessed to me.

665
01:43:40,139 --> 01:43:48,042
Rich boys with a lot of money and good looking.

666
01:43:48,242 --> 01:43:56,149
They said "Why not? We wanted to experience". That is not homosexuality.

667
01:43:56,349 --> 01:44:04,493
That is different. Because if you have a lot of offer, you are a good looking,

668
01:44:04,693 --> 01:44:14,344
rich boy, every woman wants to have sex with you in order to catch you.

669
01:44:14,544 --> 01:44:25,615
They feel that. Then the instinct becomes dull, they are not interested anymore

670
01:44:25,815 --> 01:44:37,003
on having sex with a woman. Because it's missing the feelings of being in love.

671
01:44:38,594 --> 01:44:51,465
I remember a man who said to me sometimes I wake up in the morning and I look

672
01:44:51,665 --> 01:44:58,720
in the bed next to me and say who is she? He was having sex all night with that girl

673
01:44:58,920 --> 01:45:10,244
with he was sleeping with and he was wondering... I never knew this woman.

674
01:45:10,444 --> 01:45:21,945
He was describing to me... If you continue to do like that, you may try other things

675
01:45:22,145 --> 01:45:32,741
as well, very soon. And he tried of course. Not homosexuality. He did other things.

676
01:45:32,941 --> 01:45:39,368
The instinct was blunted, blocked.

677
01:45:41,145 --> 01:45:49,291
You want to remain alive. I said to all the young people to take it easy.

678
01:45:51,733 --> 01:45:57,235
Don't go with the first woman they offer you...

679
01:45:59,983 --> 01:46:05,438
Within one day they meet and they go and sleep together.

680
01:46:05,638 --> 01:46:13,710
For me that's totally wrong. For both people who are doing this. Why?

681
01:46:13,910 --> 01:46:21,337
Because in this way they will blunt the emotions.

682
01:46:21,537 --> 01:46:29,969
In the end they will have no emotions, only sexual stimulation, nothing else.

683
01:46:33,028 --> 01:46:43,434
Unless there is this connection of feelings, spiritual feeling, you feel friendly,

684
01:46:43,634 --> 01:46:50,177
you feel connected... how can you have sex?

685
01:46:50,377 --> 01:46:57,618
Young people think it is clever if they do it. They destroy themselves.

686
01:47:15,401 --> 01:47:27,227
As I said many times I am not preaching celibacy. On the contrary.

687
01:47:27,427 --> 01:47:35,910
But don't overdo it. That's my advice to you.

688
01:47:40,366 --> 01:47:50,755
Why all the Indians when they laugh they are full of happiness?

689
01:47:50,955 --> 01:47:55,406
Because they practice austerity.

690
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:05,018
We don't.

691
01:48:08,350 --> 01:48:18,098
Any question? You have 3 minutes for questions?

692
01:48:34,604 --> 01:48:38,703
Are you English? Russian!

693
01:48:44,091 --> 01:48:58,051
-I wonder if you can give your opinion for using isopathic remedies.

694
01:48:58,251 --> 01:49:07,321
There is a book written by Smith on autism where he says you can treat using both...

695
01:49:09,375 --> 01:49:19,928
and then also use isopathic remedies from the vaccines. You have much better results.

696
01:49:20,128 --> 01:49:27,665
-You want to hear my real opinion or...?

697
01:49:32,054 --> 01:49:37,615
I will explain to you what happens with isopathic remedies.

698
01:49:37,815 --> 01:49:42,408
There is something right and wrong in there.

699
01:49:42,608 --> 01:49:50,352
But I need to explain to you more and I don't feel I have the energy.

700
01:49:50,552 --> 01:49:53,114
He has a short question, short answer.

701
01:49:53,314 --> 01:50:03,982
-Because you started with Ancient Greeks... For many years I wanted to ask you

702
01:50:04,182 --> 01:50:09,651
and I am still confused. Believe me I appreciate very much what Ancient Greece

703
01:50:09,851 --> 01:50:16,124
has done for civilization and I have read a lot about this. I just want to understand.

704
01:50:16,324 --> 01:50:20,765
You said about young people, their urges, homosexuality...

705
01:50:20,965 --> 01:50:27,799
Young people, hormones...I totally agree.

706
01:50:27,999 --> 01:50:36,709
But in Ancient Greece and in other civilizations there were important figures.

707
01:50:36,909 --> 01:50:40,041
There were people who were very much appreciated.

708
01:50:40,241 --> 01:50:47,434
Philosophers, orators who also had sometimes these kinds of...

709
01:50:47,634 --> 01:50:56,114
You understand? This is my question. They didn't have this urge. Wise men.

710
01:50:56,314 --> 01:50:59,658
They should be wise men.

711
01:50:59,858 --> 01:51:03,293
-I understand. You say that because of Socrates.

712
01:51:03,493 --> 01:51:11,668
Socrates was supposed to be one who could have sexual contact.

713
01:51:11,868 --> 01:51:21,616
He was a very ugly man but of course he was a genius and he was a very

714
01:51:21,816 --> 01:51:27,196
fascinating teacher, extremely deep.

715
01:51:27,396 --> 01:51:37,502
And it was natural that his students would be fascinated by such a huge spirit.

716
01:51:37,702 --> 01:51:45,911
That is true. And sometimes some things have been recorded

717
01:51:46,111 --> 01:51:52,170
but I will tell you something.

718
01:51:52,370 --> 01:52:01,393
Even if such practice that has been recorded, it was very rare but it has been

719
01:52:01,593 --> 01:52:12,905
exaggerated in our society to justify our present situation.

720
01:52:13,105 --> 01:52:15,696
To say, look at the ancient Greeks, they were doing the same.

721
01:52:15,896 --> 01:52:27,646
They were not doing the same. It was under this condition, the spirit, fascinated, etc.

722
01:52:27,846 --> 01:52:37,995
He was attracting the young people of his time.

723
01:52:38,195 --> 01:52:57,927
Greeks are absolutely genius in killing all the genius people who come from Greece.

724
01:52:58,127 --> 01:53:07,549
It is like a curse to the race that they should kill any great spirit.

725
01:53:07,749 --> 01:53:25,408
The reason I am still alive... You understand I am not a genius!

726
01:53:25,608 --> 01:53:31,260
Otherwise they have promised me several times they will kill me.

727
01:53:31,460 --> 01:53:36,971
But the promise has not come true.

728
01:53:37,171 --> 01:53:40,462
-You are lucky.

729
01:53:40,662 --> 01:54:04,485
I must also say that I believe that this era around 300- 400 B.C. this was the acme

730
01:54:04,685 --> 01:54:15,654
of human civilization and so many ideas have been produced.

731
01:54:15,854 --> 01:54:26,784
Those ancient people have written down almost everything about freedom, justice,

732
01:54:26,984 --> 01:54:37,960
all kinds of philosophical issues, revolving around the human life.

733
01:54:38,160 --> 01:54:46,357
It's unbelievable. I am not a scholar of this. I just have studied a little bit.

734
01:54:46,557 --> 01:55:01,268
It's amazing if you study this. A civilization that had reached its acme.

735
01:55:01,468 --> 01:55:08,294
After that it starts a degeneration of the human race.

736
01:55:08,494 --> 01:55:18,434
Today we are in the bottom of degeneration. We have totally steeped down to

737
01:55:18,634 --> 01:55:26,020
the total degeneration. This is my theory.

738
01:55:26,220 --> 01:55:44,470
After that what is going to happen...? I don't know. We'll disappear as a civilization.

739
01:55:44,670 --> 01:55:53,079
The south Americans will come to north America...

740
01:55:56,260 --> 01:56:02,198
Don't tell me to give you predictions, they will be very depressing.

741
01:56:02,398 --> 01:56:12,433
You will go home very depressed. But it's very disappointing

742
01:56:12,633 --> 01:56:16,891
the condition in which we are as human beings.

743
01:56:19,954 --> 01:56:28,811
If you see the way that wars are performed and what happens in wars

744
01:56:29,011 --> 01:56:40,161
it is unbelievable. We are not humans, we are beasts.

745
01:56:41,748 --> 01:56:53,320
What intrigues me is that the point in the brain that can bring you to heaven,

746
01:56:53,520 --> 01:57:00,879

01:57:26,454 --> 01:57:34,400
"My God! I cannot believe!"
