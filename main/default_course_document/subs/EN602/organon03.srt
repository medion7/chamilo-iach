1
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:47,963
50.The style that Hahnemann writes is very detailed.

2
00:00:48,163 --> 00:00:57,342
He writes in such a way that he wants to leave nothing outside of the meaning of

3
00:00:57,542 --> 00:01:11,090
the paragraph. Therefore if we take it word by word we are going to go very far and

4
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,690
it will take very long time.

5
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:31,923
That's why I try to summarize the meaning of the paragraph and in paragraph 50

6
00:01:36,076 --> 00:01:48,100
he writes that Nature cures by similar, that's why cure is actually by symptom

7
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:51,561
similar to the disease.

8
00:01:51,761 --> 00:02:01,903
Paragraph 51, "This therapeutic law is rendered obvious to all intelligent minds

9
00:02:02,103 --> 00:02:08,745
by these instances, and they are simply sufficient for this end.

10
00:02:08,945 --> 00:02:23,375
But, on the other hand, see what advantages man has over crude Nature in her

11
00:02:23,575 --> 00:02:30,458
happy-go-lucky operations. How many thousands more of homoeopathic morbific

12
00:02:30,658 --> 00:02:40,877
agents has not man at his disposal for the relief of his suffering fellow-creatures in

13
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:48,685
the medicinal substances universally distributed throughout creation!"

14
00:02:48,885 --> 00:02:56,826
Do you understand what he says? Who understands? Tell me.

15
00:03:06,903 --> 00:03:11,973
-He says that nature only randomly cures by similars and it's very rare but we

16
00:03:12,173 --> 00:03:18,108
have many more homeopathic drugs available so we are lucky.

17
00:03:20,431 --> 00:03:27,579
-Nature can cure accidentally a few things. But we have in our disposal

18
00:03:27,779 --> 00:03:39,579
thousands of agents, that means remedies, with which we can cure diseases.

19
00:03:42,601 --> 00:03:57,787
"In them he has producers of disease of all possible varieties of action,

20
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:04,755
for all the innumerable, for all conceivable and inconceivable natural diseases,

21
00:04:04,955 --> 00:04:09,903
to which they can render homoeopathic aid - morbific agents

22
00:04:10,103 --> 00:04:15,788
(medicinal substances), whose power, when their remedial employment is

23
00:04:15,988 --> 00:04:25,003
completed, being overcome by the vital force, disappears spontaneously without

24
00:04:25,203 --> 00:04:33,676
requiring a second course of treatment for its extirpation, like the itch - artificial

25
00:04:33,876 --> 00:04:43,416
morbific agents, which the physician can attenuate, subdivide and potentize almost

26
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:53,763
to an infinite extent, and the dose of which he can diminish to such a degree that

27
00:04:53,963 --> 00:05:03,633
they shall remain only slightly stronger than the similar natural disease

28
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:09,826
they are employed to cure". This is one sentence.

29
00:05:10,026 --> 00:05:13,466
For Hahnemann it was very simple. He is doing this all the time.

30
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:22,186
He gives tremendously big sentences. Now you tell me what he says.

31
00:05:27,676 --> 00:05:37,212
He says that we have at our disposal thousands of such remedies and also potencies

32
00:05:37,412 --> 00:05:46,347
in such a way as to choose a potency that will be stronger than the disease and cure

33
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:54,749
the disease. The idea of the potency being stronger is fixed in his mind.

34
00:06:04,318 --> 00:06:13,108
This is quite interesting from our point of view because he was experimenting

35
00:06:13,308 --> 00:06:24,874
with low potencies and yet he says that the remedy can be attenuated

36
00:06:25,074 --> 00:06:27,478
to an infinite degree.

37
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:35,569
That means he understands that the more he attenuates the dose

38
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:40,331
the more powerful it becomes.

39
00:06:53,453 --> 00:07:00,460
"so that in this incomparable method of cure, there is no necessity for any violent

40
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:09,171
attack upon the organism for the eradication of even an inveterate disease of old

41
00:07:09,371 --> 00:07:11,184
standing."

42
00:07:12,821 --> 00:07:21,898
This phrase, just immediately after he has the idea of being stronger,

43
00:07:22,098 --> 00:07:31,972
he says the means through which we cure are very mild.

44
00:07:40,837 --> 00:07:47,743
"there is no necessity for any violent attack upon the organism for the eradication of

45
00:07:47,943 --> 00:07:57,576
even an inveterate disease of old standing; the cure by this method takes place by

46
00:07:57,776 --> 00:08:06,093
only a gentle, imperceptible and yet often rapid transition from the tormenting

47
00:08:06,293 --> 00:08:12,542
natural disease to the desired state of permanent health."

48
00:08:14,905 --> 00:08:25,967
By the time of Hahnemann diseases were much simpler and his experience was that

49
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:32,522
with one treatment he could cure a chronic condition.

50
00:08:36,512 --> 00:08:43,054
This idea is not valid anymore with the condition of health of contemporary people.

51
00:08:47,357 --> 00:08:54,907
In paragraph 52, "Surely no intelligent physician, after these examples as clear as

52
00:08:55,107 --> 00:09:03,231
daylight, can still go on in the old ordinary system of medicine, attacking the body,

53
00:09:03,431 --> 00:09:10,102
as has hitherto been done, in its least diseased parts with (allopathic) medicines that

54
00:09:10,302 --> 00:09:17,380
have no direct pathological (homoeopathic) relation to the disease to be cured,

55
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:27,983
with purgatives, counter-irritants, derivatives" these are the means of the then

56
00:09:28,183 --> 00:09:37,285
conventional medicine "and thus at a sacrifice of the patient's strength,

57
00:09:37,485 --> 00:09:46,122
inducing a morbid state quite heterogeneous and dissimilar to the original one."

58
00:09:46,322 --> 00:09:51,119
After this discovery of mind, he says you don't have to attack the organism

59
00:09:51,439 --> 00:09:57,280
with such violent means, with which not only you don't cure the patients

60
00:09:57,896 --> 00:10:05,109
but you create on top of it, parallel to the disease, another artificial disease due to

61
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:09,450
the medications that you are using.

62
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:20,145
You see how contemporary he is? When he was writing this, he was considered

63
00:10:20,345 --> 00:10:28,850
totally out of any comprehension of his contemporary colleagues.

64
00:10:38,565 --> 00:10:46,792
"to the ruin of his constitution, by large doses of mixtures of medicines generally of

65
00:10:46,992 --> 00:10:55,127
unknown qualities" He says they attack the organisms with mixtures, with chemicals

66
00:10:55,327 --> 00:11:00,136
of which they don't even know their origin.

67
00:11:00,336 --> 00:11:12,768
"thus at a sacrifice of the patient's strength, inducing a morbid state quite

68
00:11:12,968 --> 00:11:19,192
heterogeneous and dissimilar to the original one

69
00:11:21,015 --> 00:11:26,959
[...]the employment of which can have no other result, as is demonstrated by the

70
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:34,705
eternal laws of nature in the above and all other cases in the world in which

71
00:11:34,905 --> 00:11:41,735
a dissimilar disease is added to the other in the human organism,

72
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:53,286
for a cure is never thereby effected in disease, but an aggravation is the invariable

73
00:11:53,486 --> 00:11:55,904
consequence."

74
00:11:56,104 --> 00:12:02,064
So no cure can happen in such a way and only an aggravation.

75
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:14,437
"therefore it can have no other result than that either"... he repeats the same idea

76
00:12:14,637 --> 00:12:23,432
again and again. So once you understand the meaning of one paragraph...

77
00:12:23,632 --> 00:12:30,873
Each paragraph has a specific meaning but Hahnemann wants to make it very clear

78
00:12:31,073 --> 00:12:36,317
and he repeats this idea again and again in the same paragraph.

79
00:12:36,517 --> 00:12:47,722
You don't have to go through it and remember everything which he says.

80
00:12:53,615 --> 00:13:07,353
He concludes that there are only 2 methods one with similars and one with the

81
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:20,039
opposites. And he says that the opposites never bring about a real cure.

82
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:31,256
"True, mild cures take place, as we see, only in a homoeopathic way - a way which,

83
00:13:31,456 --> 00:13:41,217
as we have also shown above in a different manner, by experience and deductions,

84
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:48,901
is also the true and only one whereby diseases may be most surely, rapidly and

85
00:13:49,101 --> 00:13:56,665
permanently extinguished by art; for this mode of cure is founded on an eternal,

86
00:13:56,865 --> 00:14:01,173
infallible law of nature."

87
00:14:08,034 --> 00:14:17,598
What he says is that cure can never happen with giving medicines which have

88
00:14:17,798 --> 00:14:26,016
an opposite effect. This is not always correct, of course.

89
00:14:26,216 --> 00:14:41,417
What happens is that in conventional medicine the means that we have discovered

90
00:14:41,617 --> 00:14:49,340
are much more subtle and not as crude as those used at that time.

91
00:14:49,540 --> 00:15:05,617
What happens by using antibiotics, which is the main method of treatment of

92
00:15:05,817 --> 00:15:17,591
any kind of inflammatory disease, is that once the person is attacked by an agent

93
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:29,428
and there is an inflammation we have 2 possibilities.

94
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:43,302
One is that the antibiotic will suppress the acute disease

95
00:15:43,502 --> 00:15:54,682
and will exterminate the causative factor whether it is bacteria or microbe etc.

96
00:15:56,698 --> 00:16:08,251
After that the organism will try to get rid of this invention of the antibiotics

97
00:16:08,451 --> 00:16:17,708
so he processes the chemicals and if the organism is strong enough, he can

98
00:16:17,908 --> 00:16:27,127
overcome it and can reestablish the original condition in which he was.

99
00:16:27,327 --> 00:16:36,527
But if the organism was not strong enough, then he can never overcome it and

100
00:16:36,727 --> 00:16:45,483
the organism is imprinted with a new disease which will remain for the rest of

101
00:16:45,683 --> 00:16:47,737
the life of the person.

102
00:16:47,937 --> 00:16:54,764
So strong organism can overcome treatment with antibiotics.

103
00:16:54,964 --> 00:17:12,990
Weak organisms are going to be destroyed and either die or remain in a state of

104
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:19,232
chronic disability.

105
00:17:24,855 --> 00:17:31,057
When Hahnemann says there is no other way but the homeopathic

106
00:17:31,257 --> 00:17:38,939
this is not absolutely true. What is true is that there is no other way

107
00:17:39,139 --> 00:17:49,741
which can cure with such a mild way as the homeopathic remedy. That is true.

108
00:17:49,941 --> 00:18:08,189
On the other hand we have to understand that the diseases that we see today

109
00:18:08,389 --> 00:18:18,743
are of such deep nature that many times we cannot cure

110
00:18:18,943 --> 00:18:22,502
with Homeopathy as well.

111
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:33,531
So there is a group of diseases today that the human race is suffering from

112
00:18:33,731 --> 00:18:39,986
that cannot be cured with Homeopathy.

113
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:51,165
Even very good Homeopathy, all kinds of Homeopathy...

114
00:18:53,105 --> 00:19:03,001
We consider them to be incurable. Kent had also realized this and in

115
00:19:03,201 --> 00:19:10,599
his observations he had said that if you see that you give a remedy

116
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:20,521
and there is an immediate amelioration and after a few days there is a relapse

117
00:19:20,721 --> 00:19:25,812
this case is considered incurable by Homeopathy.

118
00:19:26,012 --> 00:19:33,767
We saw a case this morning which is actually in this level.

119
00:19:37,365 --> 00:19:45,234
I told you about the other case almost identical to this with the difference

120
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:55,525
that the one I was talking to you about it was a girl of this style, very thin,

121
00:19:55,725 --> 00:20:10,788
but her knees were so big with a little leg and tremendously swollen.

122
00:20:10,988 --> 00:20:18,828
What happened with this girl after 9 months the swelling went down,

123
00:20:19,028 --> 00:20:32,484
the body became more muscular but even 9 months later the swelling

124
00:20:32,684 --> 00:20:39,167
had remained. That means the deformity could not be reduced to

125
00:20:39,367 --> 00:20:49,975
totally normal condition but the girl could run, could do anything without pain.

126
00:20:53,076 --> 00:20:59,175
What is the difference between this case and the case I saw?

127
00:20:59,648 --> 00:21:08,143
When I saw the case I described to you, it was coming from a hospital

128
00:21:08,621 --> 00:21:18,153
under heavy drugs, cortisone and methotrexate and therefore the organism

129
00:21:18,353 --> 00:21:23,669
gave out a clear picture.

130
00:21:25,997 --> 00:21:34,982
That's why I said here about the child. Let the child go to the hospital

131
00:21:35,182 --> 00:21:41,478
and find out what happens. It's not going to be cured.

132
00:21:41,678 --> 00:21:47,578
In the beginning the cortisone will show an effect on the inflammation

133
00:21:47,778 --> 00:21:52,192
and the child will move a little bit better.

134
00:21:52,392 --> 00:21:58,664
But as the organism will have a secondary reaction after the cortisone,

135
00:21:58,864 --> 00:22:03,049
then there will be an explosion. Then the pains will be much more,

136
00:22:03,249 --> 00:22:10,078
the cortisone and the methotrexate need to be increased.

137
00:22:10,278 --> 00:22:18,265
After a period of time they will realize they could do nothing.

138
00:22:18,465 --> 00:22:26,987
Now they say come here to treat. I don't know if they say it.

139
00:22:27,187 --> 00:22:30,752
Maybe there are some people who may say that.

140
00:22:30,952 --> 00:22:43,906
But they do not realize that this kind of harassed organism is not a strong organism.

141
00:22:44,106 --> 00:22:52,395
It's an organism which has been weakened in its very deep defenses.

142
00:22:54,217 --> 00:23:00,509
Such an organism cannot overcome it.

143
00:23:00,709 --> 00:23:09,353
The problem with conventional Medicine is that they put all cases with the same

144
00:23:09,553 --> 00:23:17,056
pathology and the same level together. They think it's Ok.

145
00:23:18,265 --> 00:23:26,217
If I treat a few cases and they have recovered (kind of), all cases will recover.

146
00:23:26,417 --> 00:23:35,055
No, not all cases will recover. There will be cases like this one that goes to

147
00:23:35,255 --> 00:23:42,784
the hospital and they will soon find out that she cannot be cured.

148
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:50,929
Unless... what? Who can tell me?

149
00:23:55,477 --> 00:24:02,866
If this child is given cortisone and methotrexate and she is improved

150
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:17,420
for 6 months, what will happen?

151
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:45,994
In order to get a skin eruption it has to happen that MTX contains a substance

152
00:24:46,194 --> 00:24:54,217
which is homeopathic to the case, in which case she will have a correct reaction.

153
00:24:54,417 --> 00:24:58,480
She will have the wrong reaction. That means the problem will be pushed on

154
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:11,177
the mental/ emotional level. This girl will remain a wreck mentally and emotionally.

155
00:25:11,377 --> 00:25:20,989
As long as the girl will remain in a state of fears, panic, anxieties, depression

156
00:25:21,189 --> 00:25:27,881
the pains will be remaining less.

157
00:25:28,081 --> 00:25:34,061
But if the organism is strong enough will bring back again and again

158
00:25:34,261 --> 00:25:39,708
the inflammation to the periphery, to the joints.

159
00:26:00,009 --> 00:26:08,482
After the hospital has given up and the child returns,

160
00:26:08,682 --> 00:26:16,902
the picture of the remedy will be much more clear.

161
00:26:22,698 --> 00:26:35,450
After the heavy treatment the organism is like nullifying all the effect of

162
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:38,650
the homeopathic remedies.

163
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:46,829
The homeopathic remedies had several effect, she was very aggressive,

164
00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:48,767
give Stram., the aggressiveness is going down.

165
00:26:48,967 --> 00:26:54,120
Then there was a depression, you give Aurum and it comes out.

166
00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:03,275
All these symptoms were suppressed in a way, after the conventional treatment

167
00:27:03,475 --> 00:27:16,189
they will flare up and will show a picture which can be leading and you may give

168
00:27:16,389 --> 00:27:19,599
the remedy and the action will be there.

169
00:27:31,727 --> 00:27:42,035
I believe that Sulphur had the best effect and maybe could not wait longer.

170
00:27:42,235 --> 00:27:50,833
If you waited to see really the next remedy, maybe waited 2-3 months,

171
00:27:51,033 --> 00:27:59,711
the next remedy will be apparent and then there could be a process.

172
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:08,477
Instead the parents were pressurizing and you can give a remedy to counteract

173
00:28:08,677 --> 00:28:13,064
certain symptoms but not the disease.

174
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:40,991
"[...] The homoeopathic way is the only proper one, because of the three possible

175
00:28:41,191 --> 00:28:47,814
modes of employing medicines in diseases, it is the only direct way to a mild, sure,

176
00:28:48,014 --> 00:28:54,249
permanent cure without doing injury in another direction, and without weakening

177
00:28:54,449 --> 00:29:02,467
the patient. The pure homoeopathic mode of cure is the only proper way,

178
00:29:02,667 --> 00:29:10,730
the only direct way..." He repeats the same idea again and again.

179
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:14,375
"the only way possible to human skill"

180
00:29:15,422 --> 00:29:20,307
"The allopathic method of treatment utilized many things against disease,

181
00:29:20,507 --> 00:29:29,307
but usually only improper ones and ruled for ages in different forms called

182
00:29:29,507 --> 00:29:34,903
systems. Every one of these, following each other from time to time and

183
00:29:35,103 --> 00:29:42,342
differing greatly each from the other, honored itself with the name

184
00:29:42,542 --> 00:29:47,087
of Rational Medicine."

185
00:29:47,287 --> 00:29:55,592
By that time the conventional Medicine was called the rational Medicine.

186
00:29:58,401 --> 00:30:09,115
Totally irrational actually... Today we have the same problem.

187
00:30:09,315 --> 00:30:28,295
They say we accept only the medicine which gives evidence.

188
00:30:28,495 --> 00:30:39,358
Evidence- based medicine. Rational that time, now evidence-based medicine.

189
00:30:39,558 --> 00:30:48,233
What is evidence-based? Evidence-based is when there is evidence that the patient

190
00:30:48,433 --> 00:30:55,500
is cured. Then you have an evidence that this is correct remedy.

191
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:12,894
What they mean is that if you can show me in an experiment that the particular

192
00:31:13,094 --> 00:31:28,575
chemical drug can kill the causative factor this is evidence-based medicine.

193
00:31:28,775 --> 00:31:40,086
Evidence means I can see that this drug can kill these bacteria.

194
00:31:40,248 --> 00:31:48,973
And ignores the fact that there is another method that cures the patient.

195
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:55,181
Evidence-based medicine is not interested about cure or not cure.

196
00:31:55,381 --> 00:32:02,553
It's only interested if you can prove to me and I can see it in the microscope or

197
00:32:02,753 --> 00:32:18,058
in a way that this drug can kill this morbific agent. Totally irrational.

198
00:32:31,245 --> 00:32:37,486
Paragraph 55, "The second mode of employing medicines in diseases,

199
00:32:37,686 --> 00:32:44,649
the allopathic or heteropathic, which without any pathological relation to what

200
00:32:44,849 --> 00:32:52,247
is actually diseased in the body, attacks the parts most exempt from the disease,

201
00:32:52,447 --> 00:32:56,810
in order to draw away the disease through them."

202
00:32:57,010 --> 00:33:04,640
He means here that there is a part which suffers, which is the liver, and says that

203
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:09,722
you attack another part, which is the blood, bloodletting.

204
00:33:09,922 --> 00:33:23,753
They thought that by letting the blood the disease will go away...

205
00:33:27,623 --> 00:33:33,012
"Soon, however, the public became convinced that the sufferings of the sick

206
00:33:33,212 --> 00:33:39,446
increased and heightened with the introduction of every one of these systems

207
00:33:39,646 --> 00:33:44,601
and methods of cure if followed exactly."

208
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:54,845
That means if the doctor who does the bloodletting or applying the different

209
00:33:55,045 --> 00:34:01,814
therapies of the time did not realize that his patient is getting worse, that patient

210
00:34:02,014 --> 00:34:09,692
would die and he did not realize. He says you have to draw all the blood.

211
00:34:09,892 --> 00:34:24,154
Draws, draws, draws... all the blood and then the patient is gone, not the disease.

212
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:29,930
That was the idea. That was the experience. That's why he writes that.

213
00:34:31,055 --> 00:34:39,272
"The third and only remaining method of employing medicine in diseases, which,

214
00:34:39,472 --> 00:34:47,335
besides the other two just alluded to, is the only other possible one, is the

215
00:34:47,535 --> 00:34:55,397
antipathic (enantiopathic) or palliative method, wherewith the physician could

216
00:34:55,597 --> 00:35:01,677
hitherto appear to be most useful and hoped most certainly to gain

217
00:35:01,877 --> 00:35:08,692
his patient's confidence by deluding him with momentary amelioration.

218
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:21,290
But I shall now proceed to show how inefficacious and how injurious this third

219
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:34,120
and sole remaining way..." So he refers here to milder means of treating

220
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:40,487
which are having an effect, which is for a short period of time.

221
00:35:40,687 --> 00:35:50,681
They show amelioration and the doctor is very happy and then he says

222
00:35:55,070 --> 00:36:03,713
"deluding the patient by this momentary amelioration".

223
00:36:03,913 --> 00:36:12,396
"it is certainly the only one of the modes of treatment adopted by the allopaths

224
00:36:12,596 --> 00:36:18,365
that had any manifest relation to a portion of the sufferings caused by

225
00:36:18,565 --> 00:36:30,885
the natural disease; but what kind of relation? Of a truth the very one

226
00:36:37,009 --> 00:36:44,335
(the exact contrary of the right one) that ought most to be avoided if we would

227
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:53,181
not delude and make a mockery of the patient affected with a chronic disease."

228
00:36:53,381 --> 00:37:03,647
He talks about the partial amelioration of a chronic condition by using means

229
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:12,298
which are milder than some other ones that could kill the patient.

230
00:37:12,498 --> 00:37:24,818
This is something which happens today also with different systems of therapies.

231
00:37:25,018 --> 00:37:34,043
Today we have hundreds of different ways of therapies.

232
00:37:35,749 --> 00:37:49,432
Some of them are able to bring about a kind of partial amelioration.

233
00:37:49,632 --> 00:38:02,107
If you meditate and you are an excitable person, it will do good to your heart

234
00:38:02,307 --> 00:38:05,789
and your heart will calm down.

235
00:38:05,989 --> 00:38:15,634
If you take some herbs that will have an effect upon the different parts of

236
00:38:15,834 --> 00:38:27,961
your body and there are aromatherapies and too many therapies that today

237
00:38:28,161 --> 00:38:34,007
can have a partial effect and show a partial amelioration.

238
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:46,604
But in the same way a partial amelioration could be by the similar, not the

239
00:38:46,804 --> 00:38:50,985
Similimum, the similar homeopathic remedy.

240
00:38:51,185 --> 00:38:57,497
If the remedy is close enough, it can have an effect for a week or two...

241
00:39:11,955 --> 00:39:19,862
"In order to carry into practice this antipathic method, the ordinary physician

242
00:39:20,062 --> 00:39:27,498
gives, for a single troublesome symptom from among the many other symptoms of

243
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:38,040
the disease, which he passes by unheeded, a medicine concerning which it is

244
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:46,103
known that it produces the exact opposite of the morbid symptom sought

245
00:39:46,303 --> 00:39:54,436
to be subdued, from which, agreeably to the fifteen - centuries - old traditional rule

246
00:39:54,636 --> 00:39:58,275
of the antiquated medical school."

247
00:39:58,475 --> 00:40:06,802
He actually talks about the herbal medicine here. The effect of the herbal medicine.

248
00:40:07,002 --> 00:40:14,335
The medicine which call the grannies-medicine.

249
00:40:22,203 --> 00:40:35,459
He means that through tradition people learn that certain herbs have a specific

250
00:40:35,659 --> 00:40:46,312
effect upon a specific disorder. And he says the doctor does not pay attention to the

251
00:40:46,512 --> 00:40:53,211
global symptomatology of the patient. He takes one symptom, for instance,

252
00:40:53,411 --> 00:41:05,963
if the prostate gland is swollen and there is no way to urinate, then there are some

253
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:12,483
herbs that will facilitate the urination.

254
00:41:12,683 --> 00:41:27,917
If there is some sand in the kidneys, there are some herbs that may be used and have

255
00:41:28,117 --> 00:41:36,677
an effect in cleaning the kidneys. This is what he means.

256
00:41:36,877 --> 00:41:48,072
But he says out of the 3 methods, the best one and the most effective and the mildest

257
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:55,669
is the homeopathic. Today still remains valid what he says.

258
00:41:57,259 --> 00:42:09,041
Paragraph 58, "If in estimating the value of this mode of employing medicines,

259
00:42:09,241 --> 00:42:15,948
we should even pass over the circumstance that it is an extremely faulty

260
00:42:16,148 --> 00:42:25,461
symptomatic treatment..." He goes on criticizing this kind of treatment

261
00:42:25,661 --> 00:42:35,688
which treats one symptom by a mild herb.

262
00:42:38,214 --> 00:42:45,998
Paragraph 59, "Important symptoms of persistent diseases have never yet been

263
00:42:46,198 --> 00:42:52,432
treated with such palliative, antagonistic remedies, without the opposite state,

264
00:42:52,632 --> 00:42:59,006
a relapse - indeed, a palpable aggravation of the malady - occurring a few hours

265
00:42:59,206 --> 00:43:01,216
afterwards".

266
00:43:03,005 --> 00:43:11,751
He says again the same thing. You give this palliative, after a while there is a relapse

267
00:43:11,951 --> 00:43:16,209
and the relapse may be even worse than the first time.

268
00:43:16,409 --> 00:43:21,208
This is something we have observed as well.

269
00:43:21,408 --> 00:43:32,727
If a disease has been suppressed, when it comes back as a relapse,

270
00:43:32,927 --> 00:43:41,292
the relapse is much more intense than the original state.

271
00:43:57,004 --> 00:44:08,826
If you take multiple sclerosis and cortisone is given and while the person

272
00:44:09,026 --> 00:44:17,391
could not walk or walk with difficulty, within 2 days he starts walking normally.

273
00:44:19,329 --> 00:44:30,569
But when the relapse comes, it's much more serious than when he started.

274
00:44:30,769 --> 00:44:37,197
Then you repeat the cortisone and then he starts walking again.

275
00:44:37,397 --> 00:44:46,693
The 3rd or the 4th time every patient with M.S. realizes that they should stop

276
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:54,289
taking cortisone because finally the relapse is always much worse

277
00:44:54,489 --> 00:44:57,157
than the beginning.

278
00:44:57,357 --> 00:45:06,615
What is the difference with homeopathic treatment - does Homeopathy cure M.S.?

279
00:45:06,815 --> 00:45:18,691
A few cases can be cured. If we see the case from the very beginning, we can cure.

280
00:45:18,891 --> 00:45:24,195
But it has to be within 6 months or 1 year.

281
00:45:24,395 --> 00:45:46,519
If the damage has been done in the plaques, then what happens is that

282
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:57,759
due to the edema which is formed due to the plaque,

283
00:45:57,959 --> 00:46:08,960
the cortisone reduces the edema and the pressure goes away and the nerves

284
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:14,813
work better. And that is why there is this kind of amelioration.

285
00:46:15,013 --> 00:46:23,107
But in the meantime you have weakened the immune system, so next time

286
00:46:23,307 --> 00:46:29,102
it cannot produce the same reaction.

287
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:35,847
It takes cortisone and while cortisone is needed for a week in the first place

288
00:46:36,524 --> 00:46:44,877
then it needs two weeks of cortisone, then three weeks, then five weeks and

289
00:46:45,077 --> 00:46:57,396
the relapse or the final distraction is much faster with people who take cortisone

290
00:46:57,596 --> 00:47:01,435
than people who avoid cortisone.

291
00:47:01,635 --> 00:47:05,737
There are some people who can avoid cortisone, who decide that cortisone is not

292
00:47:05,937 --> 00:47:10,465
good, they take it one time, they see the bad effect and they stop, they don't take

293
00:47:10,665 --> 00:47:23,566
it again and they try other means; acupuncture, homeopathy etc.

294
00:47:23,766 --> 00:47:27,402
Such people will live longer.

295
00:47:30,155 --> 00:47:34,806
People under cortisone will go fast.

296
00:47:42,682 --> 00:47:53,341
Do you want to ask something? You don't have any questions about all these things?

297
00:48:16,478 --> 00:48:23,455
Hahnemann gives an example here which is interesting.

298
00:48:27,912 --> 00:48:39,098
He says "For a persistent tendency to sleepiness during the day the physician

299
00:48:39,298 --> 00:48:51,848
prescribes coffee, whose primary action is to enliven; and when it had exhausted

300
00:48:52,048 --> 00:48:59,735
its action the day somnolence increased". So those who drink coffee they know.

301
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:11,479
They drink one cup of coffee and they become more alive but after 2-3 hours

302
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:19,113
the whole organism goes down and the sleepiness becomes much stronger.

303
00:49:19,313 --> 00:49:29,579
This is the reason we forbid our patients to drink coffee.

304
00:49:31,018 --> 00:49:37,998
Because how does this liveliness come? By stimulating the nervous system.

305
00:49:38,536 --> 00:49:44,548
So coffee stimulates the nervous system and produces this effect with the side

306
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:47,430
effect later on which is much worse.

307
00:49:48,593 --> 00:49:56,266
So there are people, especially mentally working people, that they have to work,

308
00:49:58,806 --> 00:50:05,282
scientists, journalists, they have to work mentally and drink a lot of coffee. Like me.

309
00:50:12,763 --> 00:50:19,662
You can check. I leave it here and see it's not coffee. I leave it on purpose.

310
00:50:19,862 --> 00:50:36,095
They drink 10 coffees the day to be able to continue with their intellectual work.

311
00:50:36,295 --> 00:50:40,639
And this becomes an impediment for the homeopathic treatment.

312
00:50:40,839 --> 00:50:49,901
It counteracts the action of the remedy. You know the German scientist who came

313
00:50:50,101 --> 00:51:09,133
to take an interview from me... it's a scientific magazine.

314
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:19,228
She came to take an interview with me and she wanted to make an experiment

315
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:23,182
after we had a lot of discussions.

316
00:51:23,382 --> 00:51:33,413
She said can you give me a remedy to see whether you can produce in me certain

317
00:51:33,613 --> 00:51:38,180
symptoms that you claim that you produce?

318
00:51:40,041 --> 00:51:49,690
I said Ok I will do this. In the meantime... there was an interview for 3 days from

319
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:55,001
morning till nights. This kind of interview.

320
00:51:55,201 --> 00:52:07,441
She was a biochemist and she was the head of scientific department...

321
00:52:07,641 --> 00:52:15,696
We ate together, we talked a lot etc. So by the third day I knew quite about

322
00:52:15,896 --> 00:52:24,222
her organism. She did not know, of course. She would take the salt and put.

323
00:52:24,422 --> 00:52:35,346
She was closed. My conclusion was that she needed Nat-m.

324
00:52:35,546 --> 00:52:47,167
How is your relationship? Do you have a nice man? No, I don't have.

325
00:52:47,367 --> 00:53:01,351
He has left her! I said Nat-m. I will give you this little sugar, you put it in water

326
00:53:01,551 --> 00:53:10,924
in your house and for 20 days you take a sip from that water. That's all.

327
00:53:11,124 --> 00:53:16,466
Ok I will do. But with one condition.

328
00:53:16,666 --> 00:53:23,520
If you want to see an effect, you will have to stop drinking coffee.

329
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:36,580
She says I drink 10 coffees a day in order to do my job. I will not be able to do my job.

330
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:47,247
I said I think you will be able to do your job. So she took it.

331
00:53:47,447 --> 00:53:56,704
In the meantime in the envelope I wrote - in case the remedy was not the exact

332
00:53:56,904 --> 00:54:03,874
remedy she needed to be cured and it was close - the symptoms that she might

333
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:11,547
have after the 200CH taking every day. I wrote that you may have a headache in

334
00:54:11,747 --> 00:54:13,989
the morning...

335
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:25,351
I wrote certain symptoms I thought maybe will come because of the repetition,

336
00:54:25,551 --> 00:54:41,358
the proving. About 9 months later we met in Berlin in the Congress.

337
00:54:41,558 --> 00:54:54,883
Where in that congress I have been given this little car, and she came for a follow up.

338
00:54:55,083 --> 00:55:08,015
She says nothing happened with the remedy you gave me. I said nothing?.

339
00:55:12,007 --> 00:55:23,512
But I see that you feel quite well, not only that, but today that you woke up at

340
00:55:23,712 --> 00:55:30,295
about 4-5 a.m. - and it was 11 a.m. when we met - and you still feel so good,

341
00:55:30,495 --> 00:55:43,008
in spite of the fact you have not slept. She said, yes it is true. I went to bed at 4 a.m.

342
00:55:45,759 --> 00:56:02,588
I said this is due to the fact that I gave you a remedy that I thought it will cure you.

343
00:56:02,788 --> 00:56:10,920
And you have been doing all your job all these months without drinking any coffee.

344
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:16,697
Yes. How do you explain that?

345
00:56:16,897 --> 00:56:33,789
She said why accept that this little powder brought a cure to me and not say that

346
00:56:33,989 --> 00:56:44,835
I am feeling well because I stopped drinking coffee?

347
00:56:47,935 --> 00:56:55,379
I said I understand you are a scientist, you like experiments and therefore we will

348
00:56:55,579 --> 00:57:04,988
do now the next experiment to find out whether it was due to coffee or not.

349
00:57:05,188 --> 00:57:25,536
Very simple. If it is because of the coffee then... I told you that if you drink coffee

350
00:57:25,736 --> 00:57:32,686
the action of the remedy will stop and you agreed.

351
00:57:32,886 --> 00:57:40,205
If you drink coffee because it will stop the action of the remedy, you will come back

352
00:57:40,405 --> 00:57:48,809
to the terrible state you were when you came to interview me. Will you do it?

353
00:57:50,282 --> 00:57:57,615
She said no.

354
00:57:59,243 --> 00:58:16,528
We wrote an article, she said you may understand, it is a scientific magazine.

355
00:58:16,728 --> 00:58:24,358
We cannot come out and praise Homeopathy. So we have written an article which

356
00:58:24,558 --> 00:58:33,620
was balanced but in the end it will be a little phrase saying maybe there is

357
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:38,659
something in these sugar pills.

358
00:58:38,859 --> 00:58:44,938
And they did write an article of that type which I have it.

359
00:58:45,138 --> 00:58:52,805
But it was a big struggle. You know how easily she could find a way...

360
00:58:53,005 --> 00:58:58,967
Why not, I stopped coffee. I told her, Ok why don't you drink now,

361
00:58:59,167 --> 00:59:07,416
if you want to find out really, drink 1-2 weeks of coffee and you come back to

362
00:59:07,616 --> 00:59:17,308
the previous state. She was beaming with energy and she was so well.

363
00:59:17,508 --> 00:59:27,867
When I saw her the first time she was depressed... Now she was beaming.

364
00:59:29,949 --> 00:59:36,162
Since you are a scientist, do it. She knew very well actually but you see

365
00:59:36,362 --> 00:59:49,447
immediately the human mind, how she found out an excuse.

366
00:59:51,766 --> 01:00:03,858
That is why I have said no coffee when you take homeopathic remedies.

367
01:00:09,447 --> 01:00:13,131
"[...]  for frequent waking at night he gave in the evening, without heeding

368
01:00:14,862 --> 01:00:18,102
the other symptoms of the disease, opium, which by virtue of its primary action

369
01:00:18,302 --> 01:00:26,559
produced the same night (stupefied, dull) sleep, but the subsequent nights..."

370
01:00:26,759 --> 01:00:35,164
He gives different examples. " [...]The old school physician rejoices that he is able

371
01:00:35,364 --> 01:00:44,583
to reduce for several hours the velocity of the small rapid pulse in

372
01:00:44,783 --> 01:00:55,036
cachectic patients with the very first dose of uncombined purple foxglove

373
01:00:55,236 --> 01:00:59,804
(which in its primary action makes the pulse slower)."

374
01:01:00,241 --> 01:01:12,710
I don't know what foxglove is. It may be a kind of herb. Digitalis?

375
01:01:17,896 --> 01:01:30,259
How do you know? You concluded it or you know? You know the name, Ok.

376
01:01:30,459 --> 01:01:39,251
So giving Digitalis of course reduces the palpitation but then you stop

377
01:01:39,451 --> 01:01:42,789
the Digitalis and the palpitation comes back.

378
01:01:42,989 --> 01:01:52,849
Paragraph 60, "If these ill-effects are produced, as may very naturally be expected

379
01:01:53,049 --> 01:02:00,601
from the antipathic employment of medicines, the ordinary physician imagines

380
01:02:00,801 --> 01:02:10,183
he can get over the difficulty by giving, at each renewed aggravation, a stronger

381
01:02:10,383 --> 01:02:17,082
dose of the remedy..." As I said before every time there is a relapse, he has to give

382
01:02:17,282 --> 01:02:24,951
a stronger dose... It's unbelievable how accurate he is.

383
01:02:26,696 --> 01:02:38,556
"whereby an equally transient suppression is effected"

384
01:02:38,756 --> 01:02:44,951
For the time being there is a suppression and when the remedy stops

385
01:02:45,151 --> 01:02:48,435
the suppression goes away.

386
01:02:48,635 --> 01:02:58,951
Paragraph 61, "had physicians been capable of reflecting on the sad results

387
01:02:59,151 --> 01:03:07,477
of the antagonistic employment of medicines, they had long since discovered

388
01:03:07,677 --> 01:03:17,245
the grand truth, THAT THE TRUE RADICAL HEALING ART MUST BE FOUND IN

389
01:03:17,445 --> 01:03:24,648
THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF SUCH AN ANTIPATHIC TREATMENT OF THE SYMPTOMS

390
01:03:24,848 --> 01:03:33,379
OF DISEASE; they would have become convinced, that as a medicinal action,

391
01:03:33,579 --> 01:03:44,045
antagonistic to the symptoms of the disease is followed by only transient relief,

392
01:03:44,245 --> 01:03:50,984
and after that is passed, by invariable aggravation..."

393
01:03:53,503 --> 01:04:00,519
What I said about the child? The moment they will treat the child with heavy drugs

394
01:04:00,719 --> 01:04:07,379
the relapse of the child will be quite severe and during that time the picture of the

395
01:04:07,579 --> 01:04:12,923
remedy might be quite clear. You have to be careful.

396
01:04:15,869 --> 01:04:22,818
Paragraph 62, "but on what this pernicious result of the palliative, antipathic

397
01:04:24,634 --> 01:04:28,090
treatment and the efficacy of the reverse, the homoeopathic treatment depend,

398
01:04:28,290 --> 01:04:31,501
is explained by the following facts..."

399
01:04:36,733 --> 01:04:48,091
Paragraph 63, "Every agent that acts upon the vitality, every medicine, deranges

400
01:04:48,291 --> 01:04:57,819
more or less the vital force, and causes a certain alteration in the health of the

401
01:04:58,019 --> 01:05:06,773
individual for a longer or a shorter period. This is termed primary action.

402
01:05:06,973 --> 01:05:17,127
Although a product of the medicinal and vital powers conjointly, it is principally

403
01:05:17,327 --> 01:05:25,150
due to the former power. To its action our vital force endeavors to oppose

404
01:05:25,350 --> 01:05:37,212
its own energy. This resistant action is a property, is indeed an automatic action

405
01:05:37,412 --> 01:05:43,917
of our life-preserving power, which goes by the name of secondary action

406
01:05:44,117 --> 01:05:50,469
or counteraction."

407
01:05:50,669 --> 01:06:05,236
He says every medicinal agent will cause an effect.

408
01:06:07,639 --> 01:06:11,153
And that is called a primary action.

409
01:06:16,425 --> 01:06:25,611
During the process of the organism coming back to normal

410
01:06:25,811 --> 01:06:32,278
there is another stage which he calls secondary action.

411
01:06:32,478 --> 01:06:44,875
So the first action is the stimulation and depends on the dose

412
01:06:45,075 --> 01:06:52,937
and after the organism has reached... it's like a pendulum.

413
01:06:53,137 --> 01:07:04,100
After it has reached this side, then the organism will go back until it comes to

414
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:13,519
the original state. This is the first idea of the proving of remedies.

415
01:07:13,719 --> 01:07:21,474
This is how he is going to describe the proving of the remedies.

416
01:07:22,215 --> 01:07:26,242
"During the primary action of the artificial morbific agents (medicines)

417
01:07:29,192 --> 01:07:33,684
on our healthy body, as seen in the following examples, our vital force seems

418
01:07:33,884 --> 01:07:40,041
to conduct itself merely in a passive (receptive) manners, and appears,

419
01:07:40,241 --> 01:07:45,321
so to say, compelled to permit the impressions of the artificial power..."

420
01:07:45,521 --> 01:07:52,725
First the organism accepts it and permits the action. It's passive.

421
01:07:52,925 --> 01:07:57,376
And then gets angry and reacts.

422
01:07:59,901 --> 01:08:08,040
"acting from without to take place in it and thereby after its state of health;

423
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:15,754
it then, however, appears to rouse itself again"

424
01:08:18,895 --> 01:08:30,134
The organism gets up, reacts and we have a secondary action "to develop (A) the

425
01:08:30,334 --> 01:08:38,351
exact opposite condition of health (counteraction, secondary action ) to this effect

426
01:08:38,551 --> 01:08:52,266
(primary action) produced upon it, if there be such an opposite, and that in as great

427
01:08:52,466 --> 01:09:04,010
a degree as was the effect (primary action) of the artificial morbific agent on it,

428
01:09:04,210 --> 01:09:08,738
and proportionate to its own energy."

429
01:09:08,938 --> 01:09:19,288
When you take a chemical drug, the organism has to accept it

430
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:26,671
and this produces certain symptomatology.

431
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:38,695
After a while the organisms tries to get rid of the action of this drug

432
01:09:38,895 --> 01:09:45,865
and produces another set of symptoms which he calls secondary symptoms.

433
01:10:02,492 --> 01:10:09,391
"or (B) if there be not in nature a state exactly the opposite of the primary action,

434
01:10:09,591 --> 01:10:19,632
it appears to endeavor to indifferentiate itself, that is, to make its superior power

435
01:10:19,832 --> 01:10:26,957
available in the extinction of the change wrought in it from without

436
01:10:27,157 --> 01:10:34,128
(by the medicine), in the place of which it substitutes its normal state

437
01:10:34,328 --> 01:10:39,284
(secondary action, curative action)."

438
01:10:39,484 --> 01:10:50,561
This secondary action, that means the reaction to the invader, he calls the curative

439
01:10:50,761 --> 01:11:02,947
action. This is the basis of the disease, how disease is produced.

440
01:11:03,147 --> 01:11:16,775
There is an invader, whether it is chemical or psychological or biological.

441
01:11:21,667 --> 01:11:39,728
And the organisms accepts it and feels suppressed but there is a point when the

442
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:48,481
organisms reacts back. I'll give you an example.

443
01:11:58,300 --> 01:12:08,210
There is an invasion of bacteria. The organism accepts it.

444
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:25,586
And for a period of time these bacteria are increasing in number

445
01:12:25,786 --> 01:12:31,014
until there is a critical point.

446
01:12:31,214 --> 01:12:41,797
At the critical point the organism decides that now I have a situation

447
01:12:41,997 --> 01:12:48,357
which is dangerous and I have to react.

448
01:12:50,645 --> 01:13:06,304
This time is when we perceive the actual symptoms of the disease.

449
01:13:06,504 --> 01:13:11,538
Actually they are not symptoms of the disease, they are symptoms of the

450
01:13:11,738 --> 01:13:30,899
defense mechanism reacting towards the disease. Is this clear?

451
01:13:47,023 --> 01:13:57,813
Another example. Let's take another invader.

452
01:14:03,692 --> 01:14:14,268
Let's take the action of a stressful information.

453
01:14:14,468 --> 01:14:29,269
There is somebody who comes and tells you your son had an accident

454
01:14:29,469 --> 01:14:32,400
in the streets half an hour ago.

455
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:46,029
With the information there is something you feel.

456
01:14:46,229 --> 01:15:02,908
Primary action. Fear, anxiety, different feelings and sensations.

457
01:15:03,108 --> 01:15:19,395
Now the organism has 2 possibilities. One is to admit this stress

458
01:15:19,595 --> 01:15:41,875
and accommodate it. What I mean is being able not to react immediately.

459
01:15:42,075 --> 01:16:00,751
You keep your control and you deal with the stress and either the stress will

460
01:16:00,951 --> 01:16:14,908
leave nothing because you dealt with it, you overcame the results and your organism

461
01:16:15,108 --> 01:16:18,940
is detoxified.

462
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:27,817
There is another situation where your organism will not be able to deal with

463
01:16:28,017 --> 01:16:38,980
such a stress and he will mobilize a defense mechanism that will have to

464
01:16:39,180 --> 01:16:45,217
accommodate the stress within the organism.

465
01:16:47,661 --> 01:16:52,428
Accommodate the stress means that if you have a weak stomach,

466
01:16:52,628 --> 01:17:04,750
you will start having nausea, eventually heartburns, vomiting and finally

467
01:17:05,875 --> 01:17:08,628
a tumor or cancer.

468
01:17:08,828 --> 01:17:21,312
In another organism it means that after the stress there is severe palpitation

469
01:17:21,512 --> 01:17:30,856
and heart infarct. On another organism there is a skin eruption which manifests

470
01:17:31,056 --> 01:17:36,516
3 days after the stress with psoriasis all over the place.

471
01:17:45,043 --> 01:17:53,299
At a certain moment there is an invasion and there is the reaction from

472
01:17:53,499 --> 01:18:01,847
the organism. And the organism either is able to counteract the invader and have

473
01:18:02,047 --> 01:18:12,127
no side effects or will have side effects which we call disease.

474
01:18:12,327 --> 01:18:23,102
Now he has psoriasis, gastritis, M.S., ulcerative colitis...

475
01:18:30,553 --> 01:18:39,671
This is how disease is produced but what manifests as symptomatology is always

476
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:54,010
the reaction of the organism in order to accommodate a stress to which is weak

477
01:18:54,210 --> 01:18:58,002
in facing it completely and get rid of it.

478
01:18:58,202 --> 01:19:03,831
If I cannot face it completely and I cannot get rid of that stress...

479
01:19:04,031 --> 01:19:16,280
I lost my loved one... if I can accommodate it and I can cry and go over it, no problem.

480
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:27,221
If there is a weakness in me that I cannot overcome, then the weakness will be

481
01:19:27,421 --> 01:19:35,799
shown upon my weakest point in the organism.

482
01:19:35,999 --> 01:19:47,390
Heart, stomach, kidneys, whatever.

483
01:19:55,452 --> 01:20:00,265
In the same way the proving is done.

484
01:20:03,913 --> 01:20:16,647
We take pure organisms, which are in good condition and we give some amount

485
01:20:16,847 --> 01:20:24,561
of drug which is for the organism a foreign thing.

486
01:20:24,761 --> 01:20:32,133
So we actually poison the organism slowly to see how he will react.

487
01:20:32,333 --> 01:20:36,824
In the same way that disease is produced, in the same way we produce

488
01:20:37,024 --> 01:20:44,745
an artificial disease through taking a drug every day.

489
01:20:54,560 --> 01:21:02,600
The primary and secondary reaction for us they don't have to be separated.

490
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:14,538
Both consist the action of the remedy.

491
01:21:14,738 --> 01:21:23,029
So whatever symptoms a remedy is producing in the organism

492
01:21:23,229 --> 01:21:30,205
these symptoms we write down as a reaction of the organism.

493
01:21:30,405 --> 01:21:36,929
The proving is nothing else but the effort of the organism to get rid of

494
01:21:37,129 --> 01:21:42,433
the foreign substance that we inserted in it.

495
01:21:46,233 --> 01:22:00,729
That's why it is very dangerous what some people are doing

496
01:22:00,929 --> 01:22:06,754
thinking they are doing a proper proving.

497
01:22:06,954 --> 01:22:16,135
That means taking a dose of 30CH and then start recording symptoms.

498
01:22:16,335 --> 01:22:25,360
Most of the time this is wrong and it's a matter of imagination more

499
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:35,750
than actual fact. In order to have an effect on the organism,

500
01:22:35,950 --> 01:22:47,358
the organism must receive a substance which he considers it as foreign and

501
01:22:47,558 --> 01:22:57,830
dangerous and has to get rid of this. To have the secondary reaction.

502
01:22:58,030 --> 01:23:06,164
Secondary reaction is when the organism tries to get rid of what we inserted in it.

503
01:23:06,364 --> 01:23:14,861
In order to recognize this you have to insert a large enough dose.

504
01:23:15,061 --> 01:23:21,489
It's not the potency. We will explain later on.

505
01:23:21,689 --> 01:23:27,535
Hahnemann created a problem with this later on when he speaks about the high

506
01:23:30,860 --> 01:23:35,216
potency that you can give to a prover but he adds one sentence which is very

507
01:23:35,416 --> 01:23:45,392
important. He says, you can give a potency to a person and see a proving

508
01:23:45,592 --> 01:23:51,051
if he is sensitive enough to that drug.

509
01:24:03,223 --> 01:24:12,115
-In the case of the invader being the stressful news what is the secondary reaction?

510
01:24:12,315 --> 01:24:19,944
The expression of grief or the pathology i.e. a stomach ulcer...?

511
01:24:21,844 --> 01:24:27,662
-You want to say the example. Which example? Of the microbes?

512
01:24:27,862 --> 01:24:33,162
-The stressful news. Your son...

513
01:24:33,362 --> 01:24:41,622
-When they tell you something which is very bad for you to hear

514
01:24:41,822 --> 01:25:00,497
there is some primary reaction. You shout, you may laugh nervously...

515
01:25:03,716 --> 01:25:11,824
But the organism is not able to control this stress.

516
01:25:12,024 --> 01:25:19,189
That means the organism is affected quite deeply.

517
01:25:19,389 --> 01:25:25,323
So the primary reaction is the shouting, the nervous laughing etc.

518
01:25:25,523 --> 01:25:36,757
The secondary reaction is when the effect comes upon the brain and

519
01:25:36,957 --> 01:25:44,384
there is a depression. That is the secondary reaction.

520
01:25:44,584 --> 01:25:55,469
There is a panic attack, an anxiety and stays in the organism... that is a secondary

521
01:25:55,669 --> 01:26:06,571
reaction. The primary reaction was to be hysterical. You fell down and you had a

522
01:26:06,771 --> 01:26:16,456
hysteric fit. Then you get up and the organism faces the stress and the stress is

523
01:26:16,656 --> 01:26:25,277
so big that you cannot overcome by natural reactions.

524
01:26:25,477 --> 01:26:33,843
And then the effect stays in the organism. But the effect you cannot see it.

525
01:26:34,043 --> 01:26:40,270
What you see is only the reaction of the organism.

526
01:26:42,209 --> 01:26:52,823
What you see is the panic attacks which come every time that there is something

527
01:26:53,023 --> 01:26:57,436
that reminds you of that time of stress.

528
01:26:57,636 --> 01:27:18,695
If in the time of stress, there was a sound, a cock shouting,

529
01:27:23,135 --> 01:27:56,350
the organism connects the two and when there is a cock making that sound,

530
01:27:56,550 --> 01:28:04,414
then there is a panic state. That is something encoded in the organism and

531
01:28:04,614 --> 01:28:13,979
it is a reaction of the organism in order to save you from killing yourself

532
01:28:14,179 --> 01:28:20,074
because the stress is too much, I cannot overcome it (the organism).

533
01:28:20,274 --> 01:28:28,041
So it has found a way to side track you from death, from dying.
