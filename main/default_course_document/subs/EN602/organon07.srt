1
00:00:20,152 --> 00:00:31,647
She has found the question that we had concerning caffeine from coffee and

2
00:00:31,847 --> 00:00:38,068
caffeine from tea. Why the one is very active and the other is not?

3
00:00:38,268 --> 00:00:51,228
She went to the Internet where she found the answer. The answer is...

4
00:00:51,428 --> 00:01:03,817
-... that caffeine is like adenosine that bring the induction in producing adrenalin

5
00:01:04,017 --> 00:01:08,423
and not adrenaline and so it excites the nervous system.

6
00:01:08,623 --> 00:01:20,514
The caffeine in tea it happens that if we infuse the tea in the water for 2 min.,

7
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:27,885
we make the extraction of caffeine and so tea is an excitant.

8
00:01:28,085 --> 00:01:39,461
Instead if we infuse the tea in the water for 3 or 5 min., we extract also

9
00:01:39,661 --> 00:01:58,925
tannin combined with caffeine that inhibits the action of caffeine.

10
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:05,455
So tea infused for 3-5 min. or more is not that excitant like coffee.

11
00:02:07,665 --> 00:02:14,570
-Thank you. That was a big question for me, I did not know the answer.

12
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:21,940
Because many times people will say tea has also caffeine... I say I don't know.

13
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:31,368
But it does not act. I thought it was the process of preparation because we fry

14
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:42,068
the coffee grounds and I thought maybe that activated the caffeine to the extent

15
00:02:42,268 --> 00:02:46,680
to be much more active.

16
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:52,902
But what she found out is the absolute answer to the problem.

17
00:02:53,102 --> 00:03:05,985
If you take out within 2 minutes, the tea can be dangerous.

18
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:10,287
That means the tea will have extracted only the caffeine.

19
00:03:10,487 --> 00:03:18,664
If you take it out there is no tannin coming out later on and the tea stays

20
00:03:18,864 --> 00:03:27,737
with caffeine. That means within 2 minutes if you take it out the caffeine is active.

21
00:03:27,937 --> 00:03:43,493
When you leave it for 3-5 min., tannin is binding with caffeine and neutralizes

22
00:03:43,693 --> 00:04:03,700
the effect of the caffeine. She found this on the Internet. An Italian study.

23
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:18,618
By a homeopath? No. It's a very good explanation. I can use it.

24
00:04:28,963 --> 00:04:43,690
Everybody has this Boericke translation and I have a different translation and since

25
00:04:43,890 --> 00:05:00,967
we are having a problem... Do you find it difficult to attend? Let me see.

26
00:06:27,436 --> 00:06:47,245
Paragraph 78, "The true natural chronic diseases are those that arise from a chronic

27
00:06:47,445 --> 00:06:58,152
miasm, which when left to themselves, and unchecked (not treated) by the

28
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:05,840
employment of those remedies that are specific for them, always go on increasing

29
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:17,296
and growing worse..." A chronic disease always when is left without treatment

30
00:07:18,111 --> 00:07:21,678
becomes worse and worse.

31
00:07:21,878 --> 00:07:35,192
"not withstanding the best mental and corporeal regimen" without being affected by

32
00:07:35,392 --> 00:07:48,682
the best mode of life, mental or physical.

33
00:07:48,882 --> 00:07:58,523
"and torment the patient to the end of his life with ever aggravated sufferings

34
00:08:00,499 --> 00:08:05,930
[...]for the most robust constitution, the best regulated mode of living and the most

35
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:14,199
vigorous energy of the vital force are insufficient for their eradication."

36
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:21,347
What he says is that even if the organism is in a good condition, that means in the

37
00:08:21,547 --> 00:08:34,843
Level 1, once the chronic disease has started will continue till the end of the life

38
00:08:35,043 --> 00:08:41,931
undermining and degenerating constantly the organism.

39
00:08:42,131 --> 00:08:51,755
Paragraph 79, "Hitherto syphilis alone has been to some extent known as such a

40
00:08:51,955 --> 00:09:00,100
chronic, miasmatic disease, which when uncured ceases only with the termination

41
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,792
of life."

42
00:09:13,118 --> 00:09:30,734
My brain jumps...Syphilis when untreated will continue until it kills the patient.

43
00:09:32,842 --> 00:09:50,385
"Sycosis (the condylomatous disease), equally ineradicable by the vital force without

44
00:09:50,585 --> 00:09:58,461
proper medicinal treatment, was not recognized as a chronic miasmatic disease of a

45
00:09:58,661 --> 00:10:06,371
peculiar character, which it nevertheless undoubtedly is, and physicians imagined they

46
00:10:06,571 --> 00:10:12,705
had cured it when they had destroyed the growths upon the skin..."

47
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:24,022
Likewise sycosis is such a disease that can be chronic, it cannot be cured and wrongly

48
00:10:24,222 --> 00:10:33,695
the doctors thought that if they eradicated, suppressed, cauterized the condylomata,

49
00:10:33,895 --> 00:10:43,010
which sycosis has a secondary stage, they thought they had cured the disease.

50
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:52,910
This was not true, which is correct.

51
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:07,807
Paragraph 80, "Incalculably greater and more important than the two chronic miasms

52
00:11:08,007 --> 00:11:14,897
just named, however, is the chronic miasm of psora" like the 2 other miasms there is

53
00:11:15,097 --> 00:11:19,584
another miasm which is equally important,

54
00:11:19,784 --> 00:11:26,643
"which, while those two reveal their specific internal dyscrasia, the one by the

55
00:11:26,843 --> 00:11:34,701
venereal chancre, the other by the cauliflower-like growths, does also, after

56
00:11:34,901 --> 00:11:40,319
the completion of the internal infection of the whole organism, announce by a

57
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:48,435
peculiar cutaneous eruption, sometimes consisting only of a few vesicles

58
00:11:48,635 --> 00:12:00,528
accompanied by intolerable voluptuous tickling itching (and a peculiar odor)..."

59
00:12:00,728 --> 00:12:11,921
in the same way that syphilis can manifest with the chancre and sycosis can manifest

60
00:12:12,121 --> 00:12:22,169
with the condylomata, psora can manifest with a skin eruption and even if the skin

61
00:12:22,369 --> 00:12:40,819
eruption is very mild, it's only a little bit of itching and a few vesicles.

62
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:48,820
"the psora, the only real fundamental cause and producer of all the other numerous.."

63
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:57,921
So he considers the psoric miasm as the basis of the other 2.

64
00:12:58,121 --> 00:13:17,054
That means that if the humanity had not been affected by the psoric miasm,

65
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:27,814
which was the first, then we may have not been able to be infected by syphilis or

66
00:13:28,014 --> 00:13:36,639
sycosis. The psoric miasm is the basic miasm, he considered it as the most difficult

67
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:44,548
to eradicate and he considers it the basis of all diseases.

68
00:13:44,748 --> 00:13:58,942
Here comes a great philosophical problem which is why humans are prone

69
00:13:59,142 --> 00:14:08,662
to diseases. Why do we have to fall ill in the first place?

70
00:14:11,452 --> 00:14:19,428
Couldn't we live a certain period of time without diseases? It would be nice.

71
00:14:21,897 --> 00:14:35,186
The question arises, if psoric miasm is the basis of syphilis and gonorrhea,

72
00:14:35,386 --> 00:14:43,898
what is the basis of the psoric miasm? What is behind the psoric miasm?

73
00:14:44,098 --> 00:14:57,857
What happened and humans became prone to skin diseases in general?

74
00:14:58,057 --> 00:15:03,322
Something must have happened.

75
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:30,044
You feel hot? Who feels hot? Who does not feel hot?

76
00:15:37,713 --> 00:15:44,309
I thought I need a dose of Puls.

77
00:15:48,543 --> 00:15:58,600
The question what brought about the original psoric miasm is a question that cannot

78
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:04,465
be answered in a scientific way.

79
00:16:04,665 --> 00:16:16,513
It can be answered only as a projection of an idea and a possibility but never no one

80
00:16:16,713 --> 00:16:37,074
is going to prove that the original people were doing this or that in order

81
00:16:37,274 --> 00:16:47,109
to have such a fate. But still I will give you a few ideas to think about it.

82
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:57,166
Take for instance, I am sure you have seen a lot of documentaries with primitive

83
00:16:57,366 --> 00:17:16,629
people, like the Amazonian people, very primitive living in groups in the bushes.

84
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:32,502
We have to imagine that humanity has started from this primitive state and we are

85
00:17:32,702 --> 00:17:45,190
the end result of a process of health and disease and here we are and we take an

86
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:50,623
account of what we have managed to be.

87
00:17:50,823 --> 00:18:06,587
If you ask a basic question, are we happier than those poor people in the Amazon?

88
00:18:06,787 --> 00:18:15,092
The answer may be not in our favor.

89
00:18:19,563 --> 00:18:38,171
I have seen that the primitive people are much more vital, happy, joyful than we are.

90
00:18:38,371 --> 00:18:48,269
This is one fact. There is another fact.

91
00:19:01,292 --> 00:19:16,716
We have a tremendous range of diseases, what we call chronic diseases,

92
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:30,687
complicated problems. These people, they don't have.

93
00:19:30,887 --> 00:19:45,858
There is another fact also that we live longer, our span of life is longer than the

94
00:19:46,058 --> 00:19:55,545
primitive people. Their average life is 45, our average life is 75.

95
00:19:58,062 --> 00:20:08,217
It's not correct? Do you know the statistics? You don't know...

96
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:15,069
Nobody can hear you. Not even myself.

97
00:20:22,311 --> 00:20:35,326
-Hunter gatherers which is the proper name for the people, not "primitive",

98
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:41,446
when we were hunter gatherers whoever is in that stage right now, they live

99
00:20:41,646 --> 00:20:47,254
long lives, some of them they die from infections of course, because we do know

100
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:53,111
that some of the people they live for a very long time, they have elders who are in

101
00:20:53,311 --> 00:20:59,825
their 80s and 90s...

102
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:08,164
-I don't mean to say that there is nobody from these people who do not live up

103
00:21:08,364 --> 00:21:13,044
to 80 or 90. I mean to say that the average span of life...

104
00:21:13,244 --> 00:21:16,302
-That's a myth.

105
00:21:16,502 --> 00:21:24,589
-This is not correct what I say? The average span of life of primitive people is between

106
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:42,660
40 and 50 years. They die because of acute diseases and epidemics, snake bites...

107
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:53,715
so definitely our average span of life is longer than the primitive people's.

108
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:10,061
These are the facts.

109
00:22:12,532 --> 00:22:22,363
There are no facts but there is a myth; which is the myth?

110
00:22:22,563 --> 00:22:42,481
People who live beyond the age of the primitive people, the myth says it was a couple

111
00:22:42,681 --> 00:22:51,442
Adam and Eve who lived in a paradise.

112
00:22:51,642 --> 00:23:02,680
And the myth says that these people were very happy living in the paradise.

113
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:13,100
They were happy under one condition that they will not eat a fruit from the tree

114
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:17,901
of knowledge.

115
00:23:23,942 --> 00:23:32,896
These people were not supposed to eat from a tree that will give them

116
00:23:35,103 --> 00:23:45,656
knowledge, because knowledge will take them from paradise to hell.

117
00:23:49,739 --> 00:23:57,561
This is something strange to think, how come knowledge can take you from the

118
00:23:57,761 --> 00:24:03,033
paradise to hell?

119
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:16,162
What is this knowledge, the first knowledge that they became aware of?

120
00:24:16,362 --> 00:24:25,552
They did not know up to a certain time and suddenly they became aware of

121
00:24:25,752 --> 00:24:36,694
a knowledge. They became aware that they were naked.

122
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:49,916
-They became aware that they were naked after they've tasted it.

123
00:24:50,116 --> 00:24:55,498
-She's correct in a way... She doesn't say the whole thing.

124
00:24:55,698 --> 00:25:09,514
They became aware of their difference in the sex.

125
00:25:09,714 --> 00:25:15,317
They became aware that I am a man and she is a woman.

126
00:25:15,517 --> 00:25:24,044
Before, this knowledge was not there. That means not that they could not see,

127
00:25:24,244 --> 00:25:36,247
of course they could see, but suddenly they realized that I am not a complete human

128
00:25:36,447 --> 00:25:48,174
being, in order to continue to exist I need another part which is the other sex.

129
00:25:48,374 --> 00:25:59,562
And that knowledge brought about a sense of shame.

130
00:25:59,762 --> 00:26:15,413
So they cover their genitals because this awareness of the difference between sexes

131
00:26:15,613 --> 00:26:23,747
brings about the first sense of shame.

132
00:26:26,357 --> 00:26:32,438
So they have eaten from the tree of knowledge, that means from now on they are

133
00:26:32,638 --> 00:26:44,480
going to investigate and to make research, double-blind research...

134
00:26:44,680 --> 00:27:00,033
they are going to investigate in order to find out why is this and why is that and

135
00:27:00,233 --> 00:27:08,670
then the snake comes and gives the apple to Eve and says if you eat this you will

136
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:13,743
know quite a lot.

137
00:27:15,324 --> 00:27:24,665
If you put all these together, you have to come to a conclusion that

138
00:27:24,865 --> 00:27:35,150
the original knowledge feeling the separateness of the human being, who is not

139
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:45,550
anymore connected to cosmos, because before they were living in paradise.

140
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:53,761
Paradise is not only what you see, the trees... you can put any depressed person

141
00:27:53,961 --> 00:28:02,070
in the best environment, he will not change, the paradise is inside, is a feeling of

142
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:12,137
connectedness. I do not need anything, I am complete.

143
00:28:12,337 --> 00:28:26,317
But I am complete, I'm innocent, I'm near the state of animal.

144
00:28:26,517 --> 00:28:37,526
Animals they don't separate sexes. They are not shy to have sex in front of you.

145
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:46,372
But can't we have sex in front of everybody? It's impossible to think it because

146
00:28:46,572 --> 00:28:52,646
there is a sense of I am doing something wrong.

147
00:28:55,914 --> 00:29:06,169
So from the moment they start thinking in this way,

148
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:25,128
there is automatically in their mental/ emotional make-up a seismic impact.

149
00:29:31,855 --> 00:29:48,444
So the origins of what was going to come later on as a kind of internal disturbance

150
00:29:48,644 --> 00:29:55,957
with an external manifestation of diseases, it must have started on the mental

151
00:29:56,157 --> 00:30:09,394
emotional sphere, with the idea of men being incomplete and not anymore

152
00:30:09,594 --> 00:30:16,586
one with the Divine, one with Cosmos.

153
00:30:20,511 --> 00:30:30,949
If you see now the history of diseases, you will see that most of the diseases in

154
00:30:31,149 --> 00:30:48,337
the ancient times are diseases manifesting in the skin with a prevalence of leprosy.

155
00:30:48,537 --> 00:30:59,418
Leprosy was the prevalent and the worst skin eruption.

156
00:30:59,618 --> 00:31:15,507
We may have to understand that the basis of the psoric miasm is this knowledge

157
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:29,370
that we are alone and we are not protected and we are not safe anymore.

158
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:40,580
And these feelings eventually will create an internal imbalance which will manifest

159
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:56,379
as a psoric miasm upon which different other infectious diseases will come and grow.

160
00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:24,721
-I thought the feeling of being isolated is a syphilitic miasm.

161
00:32:24,921 --> 00:32:36,067
Isn't it a syphilitic miasm and not a psoric? The feeling of being isolated...

162
00:32:36,267 --> 00:32:43,576
Is it of syphilis or psora?

163
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:57,421
-No. This has nothing to do. Even if you go through the Repertory and you see

164
00:32:57,621 --> 00:33:03,380
"abandoned"...

165
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:24,171
I'll show you something since you talk about this isolation, rejected, forsaken.

166
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:42,962
If you go and see "forsaken", the feeling of isolation, which remedy you seek there?

167
00:33:43,162 --> 00:33:55,703
You see Psorinum, Pulsatilla is also a psoric remedy.

168
00:33:55,903 --> 00:34:10,766
What you are saying is not correct in this manner, that symptoms, as other miasms

169
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:25,246
are complicated, are similar and the difference is that the symptom is more or less

170
00:34:25,446 --> 00:34:29,895
the same but much deeper.

171
00:34:30,095 --> 00:34:35,856
If there are 3 miasms complicated, you may have a symptom which appears in syphilis,

172
00:34:36,056 --> 00:34:50,105
sycosis or psora. The difference will be that this symptom will be much more deep

173
00:34:50,305 --> 00:35:02,689
and difficult to treat. If the person is psoric it will be easier to treat.

174
00:35:02,889 --> 00:35:10,591
If the person has had syphilis, gonorrhea coming along in his ancestry, not that he

175
00:35:10,791 --> 00:35:23,294
himself must get syphilis or gonorrhea, then the symptom will be much more difficult

176
00:35:23,494 --> 00:35:27,399
to cure. But the symptoms can be similar.

177
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:35,377
I just showed you the feeling these people have, forsaken feeling, I am alone,

178
00:35:35,577 --> 00:35:46,518
my mother left, my mother rejected me, the idea of rejection, the people

179
00:35:46,718 --> 00:35:50,256
who were rejected from paradise.

180
00:35:50,456 --> 00:35:54,672
I have never spoken about these things because they are theoretical, but since we

181
00:35:54,872 --> 00:36:03,709
are speaking about theory, it's good that you may meditate upon these ideas.

182
00:36:13,351 --> 00:36:19,316
-May I ask something about the problem that you have said before

183
00:36:19,516 --> 00:36:25,937
about the lack of connectedness, the lack of being connected.

184
00:36:26,137 --> 00:36:30,391
Have you seen from your experience that people who have cancer,

185
00:36:30,591 --> 00:36:37,583
mainly women with cancer in the sexual organs, have this feeling?

186
00:36:37,783 --> 00:36:44,708
Because I have 4 cases of young women around their 30s and 40s with cancer of

187
00:36:44,908 --> 00:36:52,336
uterus, cancer of breast with metastasis, another cancer of breast with metastasis,

188
00:36:52,536 --> 00:36:58,817
and pre-cancer condition in the uterus CIN 3.

189
00:36:59,017 --> 00:37:04,821
4 of them have this problem, complete lack of connectedness with the other sex

190
00:37:05,021 --> 00:37:11,310
and other people. Is it accidental?

191
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:17,730
Because according to my poor experience it is not an accident.

192
00:37:21,367 --> 00:37:35,157
-These feelings of being isolated, being disconnected, abandoned, separated

193
00:37:36,775 --> 00:37:43,256
these feelings are of deep, negative effect upon the organism.

194
00:37:44,883 --> 00:37:52,087
Whether they will end up in a malignancy, I do not know but definitely they will

195
00:37:53,289 --> 00:38:04,747
end up in some kind of severe chronic condition.

196
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:27,368
Couples that they love each other for many years and the one relies upon the other,

197
00:38:27,568 --> 00:38:34,728
the feeling of security is there. I have somebody who cares about me,

198
00:38:34,928 --> 00:38:46,722
I have somebody whom I can trust and can turn to him in case of trouble.

199
00:38:46,922 --> 00:38:53,982
These couples live much happier and longer.

200
00:38:57,107 --> 00:39:08,006
Such couples are very rare to find in our western societies.

201
00:39:08,206 --> 00:39:20,495
Most of the people after the first enthusiasm within 2-3 years they become like

202
00:39:20,695 --> 00:39:37,834
strangers. And then naturally the person will look for something to replace what

203
00:39:38,034 --> 00:39:46,836
was there before, so they have another partner and another partner...

204
00:39:47,036 --> 00:39:56,993
These people can have 3-4 marriages but they can never be really happy.

205
00:39:57,193 --> 00:40:02,347
They can be happy for very short period of time.

206
00:40:02,547 --> 00:40:17,936
But the couple that stay together for a long period of time 50 years,

207
00:40:18,136 --> 00:40:25,295
they are living longer than those who separate and they try to find another partner

208
00:40:25,495 --> 00:40:39,106
and another... The big secret for staying together is that

209
00:40:39,306 --> 00:40:57,686
especially the woman must not have multiple sexual experiences, multiple partners.

210
00:41:01,016 --> 00:41:14,035
Many years ago the idea was that if you don't really enjoy life as a young person and

211
00:41:14,235 --> 00:41:27,051
you don't have a good time and then once you have the experience,

212
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:33,365
then you get married and you stay with a partner. Forget it, it will be the opposite.

213
00:41:33,565 --> 00:41:46,632
You cannot stay with the partner, you will divorce, whether physically or essentially.

214
00:41:46,832 --> 00:41:53,742
You may stay together but you are separated, it's my enemy, I stay because of my

215
00:41:53,942 --> 00:42:01,637
obligations, I have children... I have nothing to do, not even sex nothing.

216
00:42:01,837 --> 00:42:11,675
They live together in the same house. This is not what I mean separation.

217
00:42:11,875 --> 00:42:30,928
Separation will come if the woman has multiple experiences. Men also...

218
00:42:31,128 --> 00:42:37,512
I'll talk about men as well.

219
00:42:55,021 --> 00:43:06,956
What I want to say is this that in my experience couples especially in countries

220
00:43:07,156 --> 00:43:15,629
where the social conditions do not permit man and woman coming together before

221
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:24,198
the marriage, there the marriages last.

222
00:43:24,398 --> 00:43:34,130
In countries where there is freedom in expressing the sexuality from the young age...

223
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:45,926
In America if the girl is 14 and she had not have sexual experience, the parents think

224
00:43:46,126 --> 00:43:56,297
the girl is sick. They think something is wrong. I was asked to treat.

225
00:43:56,497 --> 00:44:04,823
"Our daughter stays in the house, does not go out with boys..."

226
00:44:05,023 --> 00:44:12,220
When I speak to the daughter she was perfectly sane, she said I don't have the urge

227
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:18,611
to go with a boy. How can I go with a boy, because my mother wants me to?

228
00:44:18,811 --> 00:44:26,356
I don't feel like going with a boy. If I fall in love with somebody, I will do it.

229
00:44:26,556 --> 00:44:38,411
That, which was the healthiest response, for the American culture was sickness.

230
00:44:47,845 --> 00:44:58,059
The fact remains therefore that if there are no multiple experiences of a woman

231
00:44:58,259 --> 00:45:07,237
before marriage, then the marriage will last. They don't separate.

232
00:45:08,653 --> 00:45:16,398
Especially when the man falls in love with a woman and marries that woman,

233
00:45:19,473 --> 00:45:21,558
this couple will remain forever without any problem.

234
00:45:21,758 --> 00:45:32,718
They don't dare going out of that connection. That happens today less and less...

235
00:45:32,918 --> 00:45:43,783
Because the experience we have is such that does not allow us to trust each other.

236
00:45:43,983 --> 00:45:54,442
Not only trust but feel, especially on the part of the woman, because a woman she's

237
00:45:54,642 --> 00:45:59,239
27, she has not been with a man...

238
00:45:59,439 --> 00:46:06,209
The society makes her feel that something is wrong with her but the woman is not

239
00:46:06,409 --> 00:46:15,126
mature enough to go with a man. And the woman has to be very strong in character,

240
00:46:15,326 --> 00:46:23,529
facing the society which says, "Didn't you marry yet? -No, I did not marry - Why?

241
00:46:23,729 --> 00:46:29,446
-I dind't find the right man. If I find the right man I will marry".

242
00:46:29,646 --> 00:46:37,410
That simple answer is never given.

243
00:47:25,802 --> 00:47:46,915
This kind of couples will stay together but it is very seldom today that they find

244
00:47:47,115 --> 00:47:53,175
the right person, the right man or woman.

245
00:47:53,375 --> 00:48:12,536
-Just to see your way of thinking. If Adam and Eve originally were complete

246
00:48:12,736 --> 00:48:20,641
why they were still created to be different? Why this difference was needed

247
00:48:20,841 --> 00:48:29,940
if they had the same internal state? God had foreseen that this will happen...?

248
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:34,974
-This is going even deeper in the investigation.

249
00:48:35,174 --> 00:48:39,583
-We want to see your thinking.

250
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:50,890
-There are theories after that, the role of humans etc. but I don't want to go into that.

251
00:48:51,090 --> 00:49:02,198
I want to give you facts. Except of the myth of Adam and Eve but this story was

252
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:07,465
written by somebody. Somebody thought about it and wrote it down.

253
00:49:07,665 --> 00:49:16,605
Somebody who has written this most probably understood in depth the problem

254
00:49:16,805 --> 00:49:30,474
of the humans and he has given some information many years ago.

255
00:49:30,674 --> 00:49:40,954
5000 years ago, he has devised this story.

256
00:49:41,802 --> 00:49:50,816
From there on whatever information we have we use and we try to understand.

257
00:49:51,016 --> 00:49:58,647
What is our place in the Cosmos, why we came?

258
00:49:58,847 --> 00:50:09,835
And you will see if you take this fact, they were in the paradise connected...

259
00:50:10,035 --> 00:50:18,856
and then you see the evolution of the humans, as we come today to understand

260
00:50:19,056 --> 00:50:36,567
who we are, that still today the most of the educated western people are looking

261
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:41,872
for happiness and to be back in paradise.

262
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:54,569
How? Either by a perfect relationship, if possible, between a man and a woman or

263
00:50:54,769 --> 00:51:05,680
a perfect relationship with the Cosmos. If they can enter again the original state

264
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:15,282
that was the paradise state but now WITH the knowledge of what is good and

265
00:51:15,482 --> 00:51:21,554
what is bad and better don't do this.

266
00:51:26,372 --> 00:51:33,341
The original people did not know why, they had no knowledge.

267
00:51:33,541 --> 00:51:41,454
If we have the knowledge, that in order to find again the paradise, we have to follow

268
00:51:41,654 --> 00:51:48,191
certain patterns that will lead us there, then we will be in paradise WITH knowledge.

269
00:51:48,391 --> 00:51:57,156
Then we cannot fall back into that hell.

270
00:51:57,356 --> 00:52:05,130
Actually the society we created is a society of hell.

271
00:52:06,284 --> 00:52:14,105
Coming back from the original to the end with knowledge.

272
00:52:14,305 --> 00:52:25,449
People that have knowledge, joy, bliss, the feeling inside them that they are

273
00:52:25,649 --> 00:52:32,423
connected to something much bigger that nothing can separate them again.

274
00:52:32,623 --> 00:52:44,270
I have to do this and that... In the future societies will be totally different than

275
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:59,630
they are today. There will be societies with totally different attitudes.

276
00:53:14,583 --> 00:53:26,439
Once the societies have understood the real meaning of sexual play and

277
00:53:26,639 --> 00:53:37,360
understanding and how this should be coupled with the feelings of connectedness,

278
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:45,684
if they understand this, they will never allow in a society somebody to have sex at

279
00:53:45,884 --> 00:53:54,672
the age of 14-19 but it will be more after the 20th.

280
00:53:54,872 --> 00:54:06,557
And until that time the society will be giving to the young people all the facilities

281
00:54:06,757 --> 00:54:18,055
to feel happy and to be creative and to be working for others in the fields

282
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:23,398
or in the industries or in producing.

283
00:54:23,598 --> 00:54:31,160
Once this young generation comes of age, if they have not played around with a lot

284
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:45,069
of partners, they will be able to recognize who is the real partner and then they will

285
00:54:45,269 --> 00:54:49,915
be immediately connected and feel happy in that connection.

286
00:54:50,115 --> 00:54:56,419
There will be a totally different society than the one we have created.

287
00:54:56,619 --> 00:55:05,112
-The problem of lack of connectedness that some people have leads to certain

288
00:55:05,312 --> 00:55:12,739
pathology. This lack of this emotion can be cured by homeopathic medicine?

289
00:55:12,939 --> 00:55:20,224
Because it is something that comes very early in the life of the individual.

290
00:55:20,424 --> 00:55:26,452
Can it be reversed?

291
00:55:28,621 --> 00:55:32,456
-I will tell you. What happens is that in a family you have mother,

292
00:55:32,656 --> 00:55:36,530
father and children.

293
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:44,329
The moment that these parents realize their role in how they should raise their

294
00:55:44,529 --> 00:55:53,599
children, what they need, they need to feel secure, love and at the same time to

295
00:55:53,799 --> 00:55:56,818
be independent.

296
00:55:57,018 --> 00:56:02,368
If the parents give this kind of upbringing to the child, this feeling of

297
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:06,976
disconnectedness will be minimized.

298
00:56:07,176 --> 00:56:18,694
If the parents give the sensation to the child that is not wanted, it's a burden to them,

299
00:56:18,894 --> 00:56:27,792
I have also to stay in because I needed to go to the cinema, theater and I have you...

300
00:56:27,992 --> 00:56:35,933
If they just say it once, the child will perceive and will start the anxiety about the

301
00:56:36,133 --> 00:56:44,962
feeling of rejection and of disconnectedness, as they grow up they cannot anymore

302
00:56:45,162 --> 00:56:51,391
feel the trust.

303
00:56:57,356 --> 00:57:03,356
If the parents treat a child like that, the child will go out to find another mother,

304
00:57:03,556 --> 00:57:07,306
sister or brother, very early.

305
00:57:07,506 --> 00:57:16,250
Whom they find? The first person who is nice to them "I like your eyes..." or

306
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:24,049
"You are beautiful" etc. They go to sleep together and they have sex.

307
00:57:24,249 --> 00:57:31,121
Just the boy says you are beautiful and I like you and they go and have sex.

308
00:57:31,321 --> 00:57:37,199
That is the state of the society in which we are in.

309
00:57:37,399 --> 00:57:48,809
What is promoted is, at least in America, which is the paradigm of the world,

310
00:57:49,009 --> 00:57:56,593
you are 12-13 get out of the house and live by yourself.

311
00:57:56,793 --> 00:58:09,277
If somebody feels so unprotected in the society, will try to survive and he will do

312
00:58:09,477 --> 00:58:16,332
things that are not according to his conscience.

313
00:58:16,532 --> 00:58:25,999
So he will do things that will bring more and more the possibility and

314
00:58:26,199 --> 00:58:32,673
the predisposition for chronic conditions.

315
00:58:32,873 --> 00:58:41,157
Children today go out and take drugs because they are unhappy, they take a drug,

316
00:58:41,357 --> 00:58:46,976
makes them happy for a while and more drugs until they die.

317
00:58:47,176 --> 00:58:54,272
You know how many deaths there are because of drugs?

318
00:58:56,273 --> 00:59:04,763
This comes from a society which is unjust, unfair, which looks only for material gains,

319
00:59:04,963 --> 00:59:14,951
looks only for money, money has become the god, but money separates people

320
00:59:15,151 --> 00:59:17,398
between rich and poor.

321
00:59:17,598 --> 00:59:23,931
And the more the difference, the more this separation, the more the anxiety,

322
00:59:24,131 --> 00:59:28,578
the more the insecurity.

323
00:59:28,778 --> 00:59:40,154
Today in Greece in the last 2 years we had 3000 suicides because of financial

324
00:59:40,354 --> 00:59:44,880
reasons. They cannot pay their debts. They shoot themselves,

325
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:49,116
they jump from high places.

326
00:59:49,316 --> 00:59:54,614
Because the society says do you have money? Yes. You are somebody.

327
00:59:54,814 --> 00:59:57,954
You don't have money? You are nothing.

328
00:59:58,154 --> 01:00:06,240
They push us to that state believing that globalization is a nice thing

329
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:13,851
where everybody will be happy. Nobody will be happy.

330
01:00:14,051 --> 01:00:20,598
Even the rich will not be happy because they have too much and the poor will not

331
01:00:20,798 --> 01:00:25,670
be happy because they have too little.

332
01:00:25,870 --> 01:00:32,331
These are the facts and they cannot see it unfortunately.

333
01:00:32,531 --> 01:00:40,349
Homeopathy cannot do anything.

334
01:00:55,639 --> 01:01:05,638
Hahnemann went as far as the basic miasm. Psoric.

335
01:01:05,838 --> 01:01:14,097
I will tell you something that you can remember.

336
01:01:14,297 --> 01:01:31,294
The feeling of anxiety actually is the same symptom as in the physical body the itch.

337
01:01:31,494 --> 01:01:40,263
If you have itching, it does not leave you alone, you have to scratch.

338
01:01:40,463 --> 01:01:46,126
You go to bed, you sleep for a while 2 hours, you wake up and then you scratch

339
01:01:46,326 --> 01:01:50,419
and you become despaired.

340
01:01:50,619 --> 01:02:00,723
If you push this inside, it will bring up an anxiety that will come the same hours

341
01:02:00,923 --> 01:02:07,960
that the itching was coming.

342
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:14,371
If you were scratching 1-3 a.m., the anxiety will wake up in the night without any

343
01:02:14,571 --> 01:02:32,984
reason. It is like somebody is scratching your soul. There is no peace.

344
01:02:33,184 --> 01:02:44,065
There is inside something which they cannot explain what it is.

345
01:02:44,265 --> 01:02:48,248
Nobody can explain this. Then we have the development of psychotherapies,

346
01:02:48,448 --> 01:02:50,699
they try to explain.

347
01:02:50,899 --> 01:02:57,714
They say when you were young, you hide this and that and you're rejected but I will

348
01:02:57,914 --> 01:03:10,377
tell you. Suppressed skin eruption especially an eczema or an eruption that has

349
01:03:10,577 --> 01:03:17,904
a lot of itch and you need to scratch, this person will develop anxiety of the

350
01:03:18,104 --> 01:03:32,442
worst type. Not depression. It is the same thing.

351
01:03:38,261 --> 01:03:47,302
What is the reason for anxiety? He has suppressed the eruption, he goes to the

352
01:03:47,502 --> 01:03:50,404
psychotherapist because he cannot live anymore.

353
01:03:50,604 --> 01:03:58,083
He has this anxiety and he tries to find out deep causes of what happened in the

354
01:03:58,283 --> 01:04:14,308
young age... most of the time... Helen don't overdo it. Wait.

355
01:04:18,917 --> 01:04:30,965
The psychotherapists instead of understanding that the anxiety is only the result

356
01:04:31,165 --> 01:04:37,704
of a suppression of a skin eruption, he goes for psychotherapy 4-10 years.

357
01:04:37,904 --> 01:04:48,221
He comes to you and you give Staph. the itching comes back and the anxiety is gone.

358
01:04:48,421 --> 01:04:53,410
He says I have been doing 10 years of psychotherapy and nothing happened.

359
01:04:53,610 --> 01:04:59,223
You gave me 1 dose of Sulph. and now the anxiety is gone!

360
01:04:59,423 --> 01:05:07,366
The skin eruption comes back. Helen, speak out loudly.

361
01:05:07,566 --> 01:05:12,330
-OK, say the eruption was suppressed and asthma appeared.

362
01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:17,797
Will that person still have anxiety or asthma will take care of that,

363
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:20,836
the suppressed itch?

364
01:05:21,036 --> 01:05:31,435
-No, the itch will not always create anxiety. The itch can go to the lungs and create

365
01:05:31,635 --> 01:05:39,528
a dyspnea which will come more or less at the time of the itch.

366
01:05:39,728 --> 01:05:46,693
If the itch was coming when you go to bed or you sleep 2 hours and then the itch

367
01:05:46,893 --> 01:05:58,069
wakes you up, the asthma will come between 2-4 the time that the original itch

368
01:05:58,269 --> 01:06:02,225
is created.

369
01:06:02,425 --> 01:06:15,693
The young children of older times like 50-100 years ago,

370
01:06:20,906 --> 01:06:27,992
the most diffused skin eruption was the scabies.

371
01:06:28,192 --> 01:06:37,153
This is what the scabies are cause of the psoric miasm according to Hahnemann.

372
01:06:37,353 --> 01:06:47,481
Who knows what scabies are? We can communicate.

373
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:27,182
Hahnemann in paragraph 80 continues to say that "I may say innumerable forms of

374
01:07:27,382 --> 01:07:39,310
disease, which, under the names of nervous debility, hysteria, hypochondriasis,

375
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:49,497
mania, melancholia, imbecility, madness, epilepsy and convulsions of all sorts,

376
01:07:49,697 --> 01:08:00,871
softening of the bones (rachitis), scoliosis and kyphosis, caries, cancer, fungus

377
01:08:01,071 --> 01:08:17,318
nematodes, neoplasms, gout, hemorrhoids, jaundice, cyanosis, dropsy,

378
01:08:17,518 --> 01:08:30,472
amenorrhea..." he mentions all kinds of diseases.

379
01:08:30,672 --> 01:08:39,949
"defects of the senses and pains of thousands of kinds, etc., figure in systematic

380
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:47,319
works on pathology as peculiar, independent diseases."

381
01:08:47,519 --> 01:08:58,376
So he says all these diseases are originating from the psoric miasm.

382
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:13,871
Here are a lot of questions. Why since we have one basis, psoric miasm,

383
01:09:14,071 --> 01:09:23,808
why we have so many differentiations in diseases?

384
01:09:26,726 --> 01:09:33,006
Why not all of us have the same diseases, if we have the same basis?

385
01:09:33,206 --> 01:09:41,998
What differentiates one person to get a disease of the nervous system and another

386
01:09:42,198 --> 01:09:49,517
to get a disease of the lungs and another one to get a disease of the kidneys?

387
01:09:49,717 --> 01:09:53,351
Come here.

388
01:10:03,304 --> 01:10:11,314
-I have a question. What do you think about the note of the paragraph 80?

389
01:10:12,671 --> 01:10:24,004
-In these paragraphs, in this 6th edition, there are some editions especially

390
01:10:24,204 --> 01:10:30,625
in the notes which I'm not sure they are originally from Hahnemann.

391
01:10:30,825 --> 01:10:41,874
Most probably Melanie has put her hand to that as well. Cherchez la femme!

392
01:10:45,205 --> 01:10:50,822
"I spent twelve years in investigating the source of this incredibly large number

393
01:10:51,022 --> 01:10:58,374
of chronic affections, in ascertaining and collecting certain proofs of this great

394
01:10:58,574 --> 01:11:08,999
truth, which had remained unknown to all former or contemporary observers,

395
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:16,549
and in discovering at the same time the principal (antipsoric) remedies,

396
01:11:16,749 --> 01:11:24,184
which collectively are nearly a match for this thousand-headed monster."

397
01:11:24,384 --> 01:11:29,180
You have a question on that? Question for that?

398
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:36,587
-Yes, what do you think about the anti-psoric drugs?

399
01:11:39,028 --> 01:11:49,760
-What he means here is that he observed that he treated this kind of diseases

400
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:55,657
he mentioned with a bunch of remedies.

401
01:11:55,857 --> 01:12:04,580
For instance he noticed that I treated asthma with this and that remedy, put it

402
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:09,782
together, then I treated the other disease with this and that remedy, put it

403
01:12:09,982 --> 01:12:16,142
together. Finally he put together a bunch of remedies which he called

404
01:12:16,342 --> 01:12:26,985
anti-psoric, because according to him these remedies have cured the psoric

405
01:12:27,185 --> 01:12:33,567
manifestations of the patient. That's the one.

406
01:12:33,767 --> 01:12:40,382
It is not like he says give an antipsoric. He says select from these remedies

407
01:12:40,582 --> 01:12:45,998
the right one for the case and maybe you will be able to cure.

408
01:12:46,198 --> 01:12:55,571
There is another question? You have noticed a little bit further?

409
01:12:58,860 --> 01:13:09,193
"the true physician can now select for his curative agents those whose medicinal

410
01:13:09,393 --> 01:13:16,651
symptoms correspond in the most similar manner to the chronic disease he has to

411
01:13:16,851 --> 01:13:27,886
cure; and thus, by the employment of medicines more suitable for this miasm,

412
01:13:28,086 --> 01:13:37,511
he is enabled to render more essential service and almost invariably to effect

413
01:13:37,711 --> 01:13:44,836
a perfect cure." I will read the whole paragraph...

414
01:13:45,036 --> 01:13:57,885
"How much greater cause is there now for rejoicing that the desired goal has been

415
01:13:58,085 --> 01:14:09,519
so much more nearly attained, in as much as the recently discovered and far more

416
01:14:09,719 --> 01:14:17,702
specific homoeopathic remedies for chronic affections arising from psora and the

417
01:14:17,902 --> 01:14:27,830
special instructions for their preparation and employment have been published;

418
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:35,730
and from among them the true physician can now select for his curative agents

419
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:42,857
those whose medicinal symptoms correspond in the most similar manner to the

420
01:14:43,057 --> 01:14:46,154
chronic disease he has to cure."

421
01:14:46,354 --> 01:14:54,641
What he says is that now I have discovered that the main problems

422
01:14:54,841 --> 01:15:03,489
which I mention "chronic diseases" these could be cured with this bunch of

423
01:15:03,689 --> 01:15:14,756
remedies which I have prepared and I have also potentized and they are ready

424
01:15:14,956 --> 01:15:24,214
for the doctors to use and they must rejoice that there is a way of treating

425
01:15:24,414 --> 01:15:33,983
chronic cases. Take your Organon.

426
01:15:34,183 --> 01:15:40,876
-Can we go back to the question you were just about to answer before we divert it.

427
01:15:41,076 --> 01:15:45,845
You were just about to answer why we have so many differentiations in diseases.

428
01:15:46,045 --> 01:15:50,428
The one person gets one in the nervous system, the other lung disease, the other

429
01:15:50,628 --> 01:15:57,633
kidney... Could you please answer that? You were interrupted.

430
01:15:57,833 --> 01:16:09,255
-I put the question, not the answer. I said naturally I have to ask you this!

431
01:16:09,455 --> 01:16:18,222
Otherwise you will accept something on the face of what I say...

432
01:16:19,812 --> 01:16:29,986
Since the basis is the same why such differentiations?

433
01:16:30,186 --> 01:16:35,401
All the systems are affected in different people with different way and in a different

434
01:16:35,601 --> 01:16:45,977
intensity. Why is that? It is a question. Not the answer.

435
01:16:46,177 --> 01:16:53,985
The answer... I don't know.

436
01:16:58,615 --> 01:17:06,747
You can think and you can tell me.

437
01:17:08,378 --> 01:17:14,690
But the predisposition is exactly, he says, the psoric miasm.

438
01:17:14,890 --> 01:17:23,674
It's the predisposition that brings out the disease. Therefore what happens there?

439
01:17:23,874 --> 01:17:39,542
Thank you. I look nice... What is your question?

440
01:17:45,707 --> 01:17:53,166
-Many times as you said when we give the right remedy a skin eruption comes up

441
01:17:53,366 --> 01:18:01,106
but this skin eruption, the aggravation can be really strong, the skin cracks, it starts

442
01:18:01,306 --> 01:18:07,192
oozing and the patient becomes very much liable to staphylococcal infection,

443
01:18:07,392 --> 01:18:12,285
how long do we wait for...

444
01:18:12,485 --> 01:18:20,845
-For as long as you withstand all this turmoil? That is a big question.

445
01:18:21,045 --> 01:18:29,212
The thing is that when the manifestation of the skin eruption becomes worse and

446
01:18:29,412 --> 01:18:33,513
worse, the symptoms become more and more clear.

447
01:18:33,713 --> 01:18:41,431
So there is a time when the organism will give a picture for the next remedy.

448
01:18:41,631 --> 01:18:49,333
It needs another remedy of course but it has to be the correct one.

449
01:18:49,533 --> 01:18:57,374
It's better to wait as long as you can see now I have 2-3 keynotes of a remedy and

450
01:18:57,574 --> 01:19:03,307
I have a general condition as well, then I give this remedy and then the skin eruption

451
01:19:03,507 --> 01:19:10,631
will disappear within...

452
01:19:10,831 --> 01:19:21,160
I remember a case in Celle, who was in Celle? You were in Celle!

453
01:19:21,408 --> 01:19:52,447
There was a case of a skin eruption and I waited until I was sure about the remedy.

454
01:19:52,647 --> 01:20:06,274
So the patient came in Celle in Germany, I took the case, the remedy was Pulsatilla

455
01:20:06,474 --> 01:20:18,353
and I said to the class the itching will stop tonight. For months she was scratching.

456
01:20:18,553 --> 01:20:32,523
2 days later I said to the doctor in attendance to call the patient and to report to the

457
01:20:32,723 --> 01:20:41,188
class. She said the itching stopped immediately after the remedy.

458
01:20:41,388 --> 01:20:46,408
But you have to wait. Do you remember this case? No.

459
01:20:46,608 --> 01:20:55,042
It was a small boy if I remember well with neurodermatitis.

460
01:21:03,660 --> 01:21:14,037
-If in a case like she mentions, the skin eruption comes after the remedy,

461
01:21:14,237 --> 01:21:24,561
if the patient is in a better level of health will it become like an infection...?

462
01:21:24,761 --> 01:21:39,159
-It can have an infection. It can be quite severe infection because the cracks are

463
01:21:39,359 --> 01:21:50,438
deep and especially the women deal with things in kitchen where they put their

464
01:21:50,638 --> 01:22:03,446
hands into different... I remember a case she came she had asthma, I've given

465
01:22:03,646 --> 01:22:15,079
the remedy, then there was a tremendous eczema with cracks, said ok, placebo,

466
01:22:15,279 --> 01:22:24,538
wait, and then one time she comes with fever 39 C.

467
01:22:24,738 --> 01:22:34,618
The whole arm was swollen and red, she was going for septicemia, I had several

468
01:22:34,818 --> 01:22:41,549
doctors working in different places, I took her to the kitchen because all the other

469
01:22:41,749 --> 01:22:51,191
rooms were filled with patients, I took her, I asked 2 questions and I gave

470
01:22:51,391 --> 01:23:06,457
Sulphur 50M. Goodbye. I remember it was Friday night.

471
01:23:09,135 --> 01:23:19,050
And I go home in the night and as I recall all the cases and I recalled the case

472
01:23:19,250 --> 01:23:26,474
and I said to myself what have you done?

473
01:23:26,674 --> 01:23:33,738
This case if the remedy does not act, she will go to septicemia and most probably

474
01:23:33,938 --> 01:23:40,041
until Monday she will die. Especially if she believes the remedy is correct and

475
01:23:40,241 --> 01:23:50,396
the remedy is not correct... I couldn't sleep. I turned around and Sunday comes

476
01:23:50,596 --> 01:23:56,475
and I can't sleep. I was exhausted.

477
01:23:56,675 --> 01:24:07,747
I went on Monday to the Center and there she comes suddenly.

478
01:24:07,947 --> 01:24:15,877
She says look the eczema was almost gone in 3 days.

479
01:24:16,077 --> 01:24:21,725
The redness and the swelling was gone. I said Thank God!

480
01:24:21,925 --> 01:24:33,397
I prayed 2 days for her not to die. You understand in a situation where we have

481
01:24:33,597 --> 01:24:47,988
a government that was dictatorship, police was the absolute governor.

482
01:24:48,188 --> 01:24:53,995
If they had accused me, they would put me forever...

483
01:24:54,195 --> 01:25:08,990
Genius, you don't like this situation... 50M, one dose cured the case.

484
01:25:09,190 --> 01:25:16,709
I remember this case and I know when I see this, get away from anything that

485
01:25:16,909 --> 01:25:29,912
can infect your hands because it can be quite deep, the infection. Thank you.
