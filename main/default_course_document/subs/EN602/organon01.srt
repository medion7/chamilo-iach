1
00:00:20,933 --> 00:00:31,652
In paragraph 40, Hahnemann says, I just add a few thing and few ideas...

2
00:00:37,867 --> 00:00:44,834
Hahnemann says that if there is a new disease, which is dissimilar, not similar with

3
00:00:45,377 --> 00:00:55,504
the one existing... "[...] the new disease, after having long acted on the organism,

4
00:00:57,443 --> 00:01:07,107
at length joins the old one that is dissimilar to it, and forms with it

5
00:01:09,171 --> 00:01:15,144
a complex disease, so that each of them occupies a particular locality in

6
00:01:15,495 --> 00:01:27,011
the organism, namely, the organs peculiarly adapted for it..."

7
00:01:28,872 --> 00:01:40,745
What Hahnemann writes here is a very advanced idea concerning of what was going

8
00:01:41,288 --> 00:01:46,739
to happen in the world 2 centuries later.

9
00:01:50,272 --> 00:02:02,857
He says that when there is a disease, let us say there is chronic high blood pressure

10
00:02:07,511 --> 00:02:23,946
and after some years there is some other chronic condition, which stays for a while

11
00:02:26,156 --> 00:02:34,978
and then the 2 together join and form a new entity.

12
00:02:41,843 --> 00:02:52,041
This is the idea of what we battle here to separate concerning the layers of remedies.

13
00:02:52,972 --> 00:03:02,340
You know in these cases that we see here mostly are complicated cases and

14
00:03:03,698 --> 00:03:08,747
we try to find the uppermost layer.

15
00:03:09,098 --> 00:03:19,110
What actually we try to do is to separate what belongs to a deeper problem that

16
00:03:19,422 --> 00:03:22,718
was there and what has been added afterwards.

17
00:03:23,076 --> 00:03:36,664
Many times we say that this remedy will take care of some of the symptoms

18
00:03:37,556 --> 00:03:47,755
and later on another remedy is needed where the deeper, older disease will

19
00:03:48,029 --> 00:03:54,583
come up to the surface and has to be treated with another remedy.

20
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:18,801
It is an observation which is really made by a genius by that time 250 years ago.

21
00:04:19,001 --> 00:04:24,214
And I don't understand how people today they want to practice Homeopathy

22
00:04:24,414 --> 00:04:31,620
without understanding these basic issues which are here.

23
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:41,315
There are some teachers they say "Why do you need it? It's Hahnemann. Old stuff.

24
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:48,896
You don't need it." Unless a homeopath understands what is written in the Organon

25
00:04:49,096 --> 00:04:58,938
and what I have said based on the Organon, there is no possibility that anybody

26
00:04:59,138 --> 00:05:18,123
can cure a complicated case in which the organism has been tortured by influence

27
00:05:18,323 --> 00:05:31,437
of different diseases and drugs combined to cure the one or the other disease.

28
00:05:39,271 --> 00:05:48,630
So in order to connect paragraph 41, "Much more frequent than the natural diseases

29
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:57,385
associating with and complicating one another in the same body

30
00:05:57,585 --> 00:06:10,271
are the morbid complication resulting from the art of the ordinary practitioner..."

31
00:06:10,471 --> 00:06:26,249
He's ironic here "[...]  which the inappropriate medical treatment

32
00:06:27,914 --> 00:06:36,661
(the allopathic method) is apt to produce by the long-continued employment of

33
00:06:36,861 --> 00:06:45,881
unsuitable drugs..." He says something which is prophetic.

34
00:06:46,081 --> 00:06:50,648
He says apart from nature itself, which can affect the organism with two

35
00:06:50,848 --> 00:06:58,455
dissimilar diseases, and each one will take its place in the organism, will affect

36
00:06:58,655 --> 00:07:08,364
the heart, the kidneys and will affect also the skin or the respiratory system.

37
00:07:08,564 --> 00:07:18,091
Apart from these which can happen in a natural way much more frequent is

38
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:26,301
what the doctors are doing to the organism through inappropriate treatment

39
00:07:26,501 --> 00:07:37,448
which they give and create new complex disease.

40
00:07:37,648 --> 00:07:57,129
He considers that the allopathic way of treating diseases is dissimilar...

41
00:07:57,329 --> 00:08:04,653
Since two dissimilar diseases do not extinguish each other, in the same way you have

42
00:08:04,853 --> 00:08:16,740
a disease and you have a dissimilar drug, which is given to combat this disease...

43
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:24,256
These two now will form a new disease in the body.

44
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:36,284
Which is actually what has been happening all along with conventional medicine.

45
00:08:36,484 --> 00:08:46,703
Most of the conventional medicines are dissimilar to the disease, which is supposed

46
00:08:46,903 --> 00:08:55,803
to be treated. Therefore invariably they will create a complex condition

47
00:08:56,003 --> 00:09:09,823
in the organism and each one will occupy an organism or an organ or a system

48
00:09:10,023 --> 00:09:15,334
to which they have preference.

49
00:09:26,343 --> 00:09:36,945
What he says is that there is no way to treat really any chronic conditions

50
00:09:37,145 --> 00:09:41,466
with allopathic medicine.

51
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:46,937
With medicines which are not similar to the disease.

52
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:24,553
"[...]the constant repetition of the unsuitable medical agent will create a new,

53
00:10:24,753 --> 00:10:35,496
often very tedious, morbid conditions which might be anticipated from

54
00:10:35,696 --> 00:10:39,277
the peculiar powers of the drug."

55
00:10:39,477 --> 00:10:55,857
He was talking with an experience of the drugs used then, which were much more

56
00:10:56,057 --> 00:11:08,542
crude, not refined. Today we are using much more refined drugs and therefore

57
00:11:08,742 --> 00:11:11,657
more dangerous actually.

58
00:11:16,037 --> 00:11:26,281
Why they are much more dangerous? Because they are quickly able to suppress

59
00:11:26,481 --> 00:11:34,465
the disease, do not allow the organism to have a chance to react and

60
00:11:34,665 --> 00:11:57,603
the new disease which manifests will be occupying an organ which will be vulnerable

61
00:11:57,803 --> 00:12:00,937
to such drugs.

62
00:12:04,344 --> 00:12:14,752
Because the new drugs are subtle, they are going to affect the subtlest part

63
00:12:14,952 --> 00:12:24,690
of our being, which is the nervous system, central and peripheral.

64
00:12:28,613 --> 00:12:36,114
If you carefully read this paragraph, you will understand what has happened today

65
00:12:36,314 --> 00:12:38,400
in the world.

66
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:47,183
The drugs that have been used all along these years have pushed the pathology

67
00:12:47,383 --> 00:12:57,908
towards the central and peripheral nervous system and has created a society

68
00:12:58,108 --> 00:13:07,403
which is sick on a very deep mental emotional level.

69
00:13:10,967 --> 00:13:17,140
This is what he actually says. By constant repetition. He's so careful with his

70
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:30,217
expression. He says if you repeat frequently a drug, it will definitely make a damage.

71
00:13:37,112 --> 00:13:48,888
You see why it is so difficult that this kind of teaching is difficult to be taught

72
00:13:49,088 --> 00:13:57,383
in a medical school with conventional medical people.

73
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:08,644
Because you can imagine a teacher going in the class saying if you give antibiotics,

74
00:14:08,844 --> 00:14:16,870
cortisone, chemotherapy you are going to damage the organism.

75
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:21,001
And the other teacher will come and say in order to save your life

76
00:14:21,201 --> 00:14:32,728
you have to take these drugs. You understand the real problem in diffusing

77
00:14:32,928 --> 00:14:40,282
Homeopathy and being accepted on a bigger scale.

78
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:52,997
Also from this paragraph you may understand that the idea of giving a remedy

79
00:14:53,197 --> 00:15:04,167
for the totality is not valid anymore for contemporary people, especially those who

80
00:15:04,367 --> 00:15:11,538
have been vaccinated a lot, who have been taking a lot of drugs and who have created

81
00:15:11,738 --> 00:15:16,270
in their organism a complex...

82
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:22,413
So when they come to the homeopath, he must understand what this vaccination

83
00:15:22,613 --> 00:15:32,664
has done, what was the formation of the problem after this particular drug

84
00:15:32,864 --> 00:15:41,475
that was taken and what happened later on with an acute condition that came

85
00:15:41,675 --> 00:15:45,891
and was treated wrongly and was suppressed etc.

86
00:15:46,091 --> 00:15:57,946
Then you have a complex so complicated and you have to be so careful to treat

87
00:15:58,146 --> 00:16:09,460
the uppermost layer, so the next layer underneath can manifest itself,

88
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:14,020
give you more information and the 3rd and the 4th remedy...

89
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:21,010
and then the organism feels relieved.

90
00:16:23,142 --> 00:16:31,329
You see how many times you give a remedy and the patient comes and says

91
00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:40,587
I'm the same. But you take carefully the case and you see some changes

92
00:16:40,787 --> 00:16:46,260
and you see also some new symptoms that have appeared.

93
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:58,068
For the patient means nothing. You expect after you have given Arsenicum

94
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:03,819
underneath is a layer of Phosphorus

95
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:14,766
and you have based your prescription in a few keynotes of Arsenicum.

96
00:17:14,966 --> 00:17:33,759
One keynote of Arsenicum is the thirst, sipping, usually with hot drinks.

97
00:17:33,959 --> 00:17:38,961
They like hot drinks because they feel very cold.

98
00:17:39,161 --> 00:17:46,752
And you have given Arsenicum and he says there's no change, I am the same.

99
00:17:46,952 --> 00:17:55,194
You say what about the thirst, are you still drinking like this?

100
00:17:55,394 --> 00:18:06,995
He says, no I can drink half a cup. This becomes very important for the homeopath.

101
00:18:07,195 --> 00:18:16,165
A little thing like that. And the next question is the water you want must be

102
00:18:16,365 --> 00:18:27,026
in room temperature or it must be cold? Lately I need cold water.

103
00:18:27,226 --> 00:18:35,359
This indicates that the underlying layer of Phosphorus which you expect

104
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:41,335
is coming up, whether it's completed or not, it will depend further on

105
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:51,040
the investigation, but these little changes show that your first remedy was correct

106
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,411
in spite of the fact he says I am the same.

107
00:18:54,611 --> 00:19:02,195
He is the same but unless you examine properly the case how can you untangle

108
00:19:02,395 --> 00:19:11,399
such a complicated issue that has become through all the vaccination, the drugs,

109
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:25,130
the pollution, the recreational drugs that young people are using today, alcohol...

110
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:35,009
Is the alcohol a drug? No, but the alcohol can produce a case which is alcoholism

111
00:19:35,209 --> 00:19:44,236
which is a disease with specific symptomatology.

112
00:19:44,436 --> 00:19:53,151
Which disease has occupied more the liver.

113
00:19:53,351 --> 00:20:05,744
But this person before alcoholism had hay fever.

114
00:20:05,944 --> 00:20:14,308
And now the hay fever after the vaccination has become from time to time dyspnea

115
00:20:14,508 --> 00:20:17,992
or asthmatic condition.

116
00:20:25,403 --> 00:20:32,497
And due to vaccinations or anything that was affecting his organism,

117
00:20:32,697 --> 00:20:36,035
his kidneys are affected as well.

118
00:20:39,874 --> 00:20:48,906
You see 3 parts, the upper respiratory tract, the liver and the kidneys are affected

119
00:20:49,106 --> 00:20:57,187
in that person and if you investigate you may find exactly what has happened

120
00:20:57,387 --> 00:21:00,711
in the history of the person.

121
00:21:01,912 --> 00:21:10,172
But you have to investigate, with this information in mind.

122
00:21:13,622 --> 00:21:21,089
If you don't have this information, if you don't know how disease is produced

123
00:21:21,289 --> 00:21:28,702
in a human organism, how can you investigate in a chaotic situation?

124
00:21:28,902 --> 00:21:36,690
I have rheumatic pains, I have hay fever, I'm an alcoholic... You're lost.

125
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:57,181
The problem can be solved like this if you have read the Organon. Of course not.

126
00:21:57,381 --> 00:22:07,748
The Organon is a part of the knowledge. The other part which is equally important

127
00:22:07,948 --> 00:22:14,349
is the knowledge of Materia Medica.

128
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:21,839
And then the combination of the knowledge of the layers and the knowledge

129
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:29,373
of the M.M. gives you the possibility to clear up the case.

130
00:22:37,543 --> 00:22:44,323
You may say what you tell us is so difficult, how can we do it?

131
00:22:44,523 --> 00:22:55,507
And that is why we have what we call the repertorisation.

132
00:22:55,707 --> 00:23:04,276
The repertorisation was necessary from almost the very beginning of Homeopathy.

133
00:23:04,476 --> 00:23:17,312
We had computer system through repertorisation and I'm sure Fred will tell you

134
00:23:17,512 --> 00:23:24,347
how repertorisation was done initially with the hand.

135
00:23:24,547 --> 00:23:37,829
I remember one of my first cases when I was in South Africa in 1960 and there was

136
00:23:38,029 --> 00:23:49,503
a nice girl. I liked her. I was flirting and told her to take her case.

137
00:23:49,703 --> 00:23:59,000
It was a big thing to impress her. Then I started repertorising because I had only

138
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:07,732
Kent's Repertory and with my hand I repertorised the totality.

139
00:24:07,932 --> 00:24:14,643
I could not make out anything. Then I started repertorising, eliminating

140
00:24:14,843 --> 00:24:24,228
repertorisation. I worked so hard and I slept, I could not make out.

141
00:24:26,637 --> 00:24:34,904
On waking in the morning at 6 o'clock without repertorisation, it came to my mind

142
00:24:35,104 --> 00:24:41,237
the remedy is Ignatia.

143
00:24:41,437 --> 00:24:49,209
Because I had made all this work, I had studied the M.M. already quite a lot.

144
00:24:49,409 --> 00:24:56,806
I knew the remedy. She was cured.

145
00:24:57,006 --> 00:25:01,641
But after that she became of no interest to me.

146
00:25:08,631 --> 00:25:13,409
Ignatia is hysterical and very sensitive.

147
00:25:13,609 --> 00:25:21,922
If they come back to the normal, there is no interest.

148
00:25:44,748 --> 00:25:55,427
In paragraph 42 says, "Nature herself permits, as has been stated in some cases,

149
00:25:55,627 --> 00:26:02,718
the simultaneous occurrence of two (indeed, of three) natural diseases

150
00:26:02,918 --> 00:26:06,677
in one and the same body..."

151
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:17,419
He had already noticed this. This is impressive because most probably

152
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:30,887
what was happening in his time, it was that he received all cases that were incurable

153
00:26:31,087 --> 00:26:38,610
during that time, so he was receiving all the complicated cases of the time.

154
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:46,399
During this time where most people were healthy and the organism by itself

155
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:53,021
whether given a remedy or not they recovered spontaneously.

156
00:26:53,221 --> 00:27:01,755
But those who did not recover could not be cured by any kind of bloodletting,

157
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:10,971
or the mercury that was given and all these different heavy drugs.

158
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:18,204
So he was receiving all the complicated cases and that's why he was able to do

159
00:27:18,404 --> 00:27:21,511
this observation.

160
00:27:24,979 --> 00:27:30,932
Nature herself permits in the same body 3 different diseases.

161
00:27:31,132 --> 00:27:39,858
"[...]This complication, however, it must be remarked, happens only in the case

162
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:46,968
of two dissimilar diseases [...]and cannot cure one another, but, as it seems,

163
00:27:47,168 --> 00:27:55,175
both (or all three) remain, as it were, separate in the organism, and each takes

164
00:27:55,375 --> 00:28:03,718
possession of the parts and systems peculiarly appropriate to it."

165
00:28:03,918 --> 00:28:13,574
In paragraph 43 says, "Totally different, however, is the result when two similar

166
00:28:13,774 --> 00:28:22,493
diseases meet together in the organism, that is to say, when to the disease already

167
00:28:22,693 --> 00:28:27,871
present a stronger similar one is added.

168
00:28:28,071 --> 00:28:38,038
In such cases we see how a cure can be affected by the operations of nature,

169
00:28:38,238 --> 00:28:45,064
and we get a lesson as to how man ought to cure."

170
00:28:45,264 --> 00:28:51,930
This is something that he could have observed only himself.

171
00:28:52,130 --> 00:29:05,812
Today we do not see this because nothing is left to exist in the organism for long

172
00:29:06,012 --> 00:29:14,534
enough, so another disease will come someday which will be similar and cure.

173
00:29:14,734 --> 00:29:25,788
This observation is not in our experience. We don't know it.

174
00:29:25,988 --> 00:29:33,907
But in his time it was happening because they could not suppress immediately

175
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:38,752
the one or the other disease.

176
00:29:51,568 --> 00:30:06,573
Paragraph 44, "Two diseases similar to each other can neither repel one another,

177
00:30:06,773 --> 00:30:22,363
nor suspend on another, so that the old one shall return after the new one has run

178
00:30:22,563 --> 00:30:29,241
its course..." So he concludes that if there are 2 dissimilar diseases, if they come to the

179
00:30:29,441 --> 00:30:41,841
body, the one will run its course and suppress the other, which is already there and

180
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:54,180
once this runs its course and it's gone the next one will manifest.

181
00:30:55,188 --> 00:30:57,867
We don't have this experience either in our contemporary cases.

182
00:30:58,067 --> 00:31:09,647
We do not see this because we have such wonderful drugs.

183
00:31:15,034 --> 00:31:21,246
What the wonderful drugs are doing, when things are happening like this...

184
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:31,926
Somebody has a colitis and he tries to cure it and takes some spasmolytic drugs

185
00:31:32,126 --> 00:31:44,487
and then one day he gets a pneumonia, treated with allopathic drugs and then

186
00:31:44,687 --> 00:31:51,681
because of the suppression of the pneumonia the person develops

187
00:31:51,881 --> 00:31:55,458
an asthmatic condition.

188
00:31:55,658 --> 00:32:19,453
He has now asthma and colitis. What happens for a homeopath who sees such a case?

189
00:32:24,534 --> 00:32:40,619
You search for the remedy and you may see several remedies indicated.

190
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:45,690
This is a possibility. But there is another possibility.

191
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:56,951
If the organism is strong, his immune system is in very good condition and

192
00:32:57,151 --> 00:33:07,878
it can happen that both the asthma and the colitis need the same remedy.

193
00:33:08,078 --> 00:33:15,321
So you give the remedy and then the person comes and says my asthma is better,

194
00:33:15,521 --> 00:33:23,341
my colitis is better with one remedy.

195
00:33:23,541 --> 00:33:35,943
That indicates an immune system which is quite strong and also indicates the person

196
00:33:36,143 --> 00:33:40,383
is going to live for many years.

197
00:33:43,293 --> 00:33:57,488
Also indicates that if that person is careful with his organism and does not misuse

198
00:33:57,688 --> 00:34:07,726
his organism by staying awake at night, by drugs, by all the kind of things that we do

199
00:34:07,926 --> 00:34:20,487
today, especially the younger people, we can see later on after a year or two

200
00:34:20,687 --> 00:34:23,630
the underlying layer as well.

201
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:33,555
That means one remedy has acted beautifully, has relieved both pathologies but

202
00:34:33,755 --> 00:34:44,718
still the organism because it went into this condition it means he had a predisposition.

203
00:34:49,648 --> 00:34:59,925
Can we try to find what was the underlying remedy, which was even beyond the

204
00:35:00,125 --> 00:35:08,254
Calc. Carbonica or beyond Phosphorus or whatever remedy, Arsenicum you gave...?

205
00:35:08,454 --> 00:35:24,362
Is it possible after Calc.Carb. there were small problems that indicated

206
00:35:24,562 --> 00:35:33,818
for instance Sulphur? It is possible but many people they go away

207
00:35:34,018 --> 00:35:39,118
and they will be happy with Calc. and they will never come back.

208
00:35:39,318 --> 00:35:50,878
When later on they will develop some itching in the skin and some little anxiety

209
00:35:51,078 --> 00:35:58,596
and irritability and the itching becomes quite strong and then there is some kind

210
00:35:58,796 --> 00:36:07,400
of eczema, they forget the homeopath and they go to the dermatologist, they take

211
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,356
a cream and they fix it.

212
00:36:20,308 --> 00:36:29,073
This layer, the underlying layer, is the layer on which it was possible to develop

213
00:36:29,273 --> 00:36:40,749
the spastic colitis through stress that the person went through and needed

214
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:49,990
Nat-m. or Calc. but there was no homeopath to give Nat-m. at the moment

215
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:56,333
so he remained with the spastic colitis and spasmolytics that he was taking for years.

216
00:36:56,533 --> 00:37:07,838
Then the pneumonia came and it was not treated homeopathically.

217
00:37:08,038 --> 00:37:14,740
It was treated allopathically, so this was suppressed and then the asthma came.

218
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:31,523
In most of the cases will be complicated. Different remedies needed in order to cure

219
00:37:31,723 --> 00:37:40,568
but even in a case where the remedy that you will give covers both the pathologies

220
00:37:40,768 --> 00:37:51,568
there is the underlying remedy that if it can be found there is no danger of people

221
00:37:51,768 --> 00:37:58,643
having a relapse on the colitis or on the asthma.

222
00:38:00,309 --> 00:38:09,174
If you do not give this underlying remedy, the possibility is always under stress

223
00:38:09,374 --> 00:38:12,960
to have a relapse.

224
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:23,920
And what will be the relapse? The same sensitivities that he had before,

225
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,233
the colitis is coming back...

226
00:38:30,265 --> 00:38:39,052
But you have to be careful because he will come after 2 years and say that I was well

227
00:38:39,252 --> 00:38:54,171
but now I had a stress, my wife left me. I love my wife and she left me.

228
00:38:54,371 --> 00:39:00,900
And my colitis is back.

229
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:06,327
Then the most probable is that you look at your notes and you see Calc. has cured and

230
00:39:06,527 --> 00:39:15,545
you give him Calc. Carb. It's not always like that.

231
00:39:15,745 --> 00:39:25,059
It might be that this time because the manifestation of symptoms are not exactly

232
00:39:25,259 --> 00:39:34,280
the same for Calc., now Ignatia is needed first.

233
00:39:35,754 --> 00:39:45,680
The organism has been weakened all these 3-4 years, he needs now the Ignatia

234
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:54,563
which takes away the sadness, keeps the colitis, the colitis becomes worse and

235
00:39:54,763 --> 00:40:04,652
then comes again the remedy which you have given before, the Calc. Carb.

236
00:40:18,214 --> 00:40:22,677
I understand it is a little bit difficult.

237
00:40:34,503 --> 00:40:41,060
-What if this underlying layer that is the base of all the pathology is not clear to us?

238
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:46,292
We cannot see the remedy. We just wait...

239
00:40:46,492 --> 00:41:10,912
-Yes wait. The idea of Hahnemann was that they are layers due to 3 basic miasms.

240
00:41:11,112 --> 00:41:25,098
Psoric, syphilitic, sycotic. He considers the psoric miasm, as the deepest and the oldest.

241
00:41:25,298 --> 00:41:37,795
Which is true. Syphilis manifests in the world quite later, while manifestations

242
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:46,918
on the skin we have from the very old times.

243
00:41:50,967 --> 00:42:01,898
The miasm or the layer which will manifest on the last portion of the treatment of

244
00:42:02,098 --> 00:42:12,120
a person will be of a miasmatic character akin to the psoric miasm.

245
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:22,314
That's why I said that you may need Sulphur which is underneath but it's not

246
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:34,347
recognized, it's not given and therefore the relapse will be of the same type

247
00:42:34,547 --> 00:42:38,486
as before, colitis.

248
00:42:38,686 --> 00:42:48,056
You may say a miasm can go away with one remedy Sulph. or whatever?

249
00:42:48,256 --> 00:42:57,841
No, you may need 2 or 3 or 4 remedies before you can eliminate a miasm.

250
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:23,937
You will see if you treat people for long periods of time...

251
00:43:24,137 --> 00:43:29,117
Usually the homeopaths have such possibilities because the person has been

252
00:43:29,317 --> 00:43:35,056
originally benefited and therefore he comes back to the homeopath and

253
00:43:35,256 --> 00:43:45,334
the homeopath has the possibility to see the different miasmatic predisposition

254
00:43:45,534 --> 00:43:50,100
coming up as the time goes by.

255
00:43:54,518 --> 00:44:09,837
That is why you may see that you have treated a deep pathology

256
00:44:10,037 --> 00:44:19,448
and you have used Med., Thuja, Nat-s. basic sycotic remedies.

257
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:41,579
And as the symptomatology changes, the person comes with great irritability

258
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:51,658
and you treat with Nux-v.

259
00:44:51,858 --> 00:45:03,032
After a year you lose the patient, he does not come, he is under stress

260
00:45:03,232 --> 00:45:07,023
and he is depressed.

261
00:45:10,364 --> 00:45:20,927
And you see the depression is of Merc. type and you give Mercury and some

262
00:45:21,127 --> 00:45:32,874
changes are there but still the depression continues and he has suicidal thoughts.

263
00:45:33,074 --> 00:45:37,851
You give Aur., suicidal thoughts are gone, the depression is ameliorated.

264
00:45:44,168 --> 00:45:55,854
After you have treated a person for the sycotic condition, remedies that will come up

265
00:45:56,054 --> 00:46:05,741
would rather belong to the syphilitic miasm. And you may wonder how is that?

266
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:22,110
I treated him for a pathology and it was quite severe and I helped him.

267
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:30,707
Now under stress instead of the original pathology coming back

268
00:46:30,907 --> 00:46:40,986
the depression comes. Is that a deeper state?

269
00:46:41,186 --> 00:46:51,146
If that happens it means, no, the original pathology was of a more severe type

270
00:46:51,346 --> 00:47:02,516
than the manifested, later on, depression which needed Merc. and Aur. to be cured.

271
00:47:02,716 --> 00:47:08,379
That means the original pathology would kill the patient.

272
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:17,074
The life of the patient was in danger. So it was a very severe condition.

273
00:47:19,553 --> 00:47:27,314
Now under stress what is left in the organism is the next layer which is of

274
00:47:27,514 --> 00:47:37,037
a syphilitic origin, it's activated and it brings out symptoms of depression.

275
00:47:37,237 --> 00:47:46,281
You give Mercury, Aurum-Muriaticum, Aurum-Metallicum...

276
00:47:48,375 --> 00:47:54,229
This can happen especially with cases you treat from childhood with

277
00:47:54,429 --> 00:48:00,587
severe problems and the children are really in danger.

278
00:48:00,787 --> 00:48:12,434
When they are 20 they come and they tell you that I don't feel well,

279
00:48:12,634 --> 00:48:26,126
I'm depressed and you investigate and whether the girl has thought of suicide

280
00:48:26,326 --> 00:48:51,586
and she may admit that she has made an attempt to suicide

281
00:48:51,786 --> 00:48:58,775
not in a serious way, not jumping from the Acropolis but...

282
00:49:01,295 --> 00:49:10,213
And then you say why you did that? And you find out that it is because of

283
00:49:10,413 --> 00:49:31,960
love disappointment. The syphilitic layer brings up a psychological condition

284
00:49:34,829 --> 00:49:46,579
that the girl falls in love quite easily and without control.

285
00:49:49,263 --> 00:50:01,104
As a result she has an affair and because of full-blown erotic passion,

286
00:50:01,304 --> 00:50:10,338
the other person gets tired quite easily and after a while he says goodbye.

287
00:50:10,538 --> 00:50:19,684
And then she overcomes this and falls in love again and the same scenery is produced.

288
00:50:19,884 --> 00:50:27,783
The 2d or 3rd time she will commit suicide. She is going to an Aur. state.

289
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:32,290
Most probably not Aur.-Metalicum but Aur-Muriaticum.

290
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:41,696
But still this is the syphilitic layer underneath which gives imbalance in that area.

291
00:50:45,437 --> 00:51:03,459
The sycotic layer gives a passion which is much mundane, more physical.

292
00:51:03,659 --> 00:51:12,767
Testosterone is high even in women. And explosions...

293
00:51:12,967 --> 00:51:29,480
You will see in their love affairs they hit, they attack, they make a lot of scenes,

294
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,690
very much aggressive.

295
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:58,012
When this layer is gone and the syphilitic layer has come up, the physical passion is

296
00:51:58,212 --> 00:52:16,823
reduced and it takes a direction which is not absolutely normal.

297
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:28,210
When the syphilis layer is manifesting in a person affecting the sexual sphere,

298
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:38,224
then the desire of the person for having contact, is not going to be the normal contact

299
00:52:38,424 --> 00:52:57,747
between men and women, it twists the instinct and in order to be excited

300
00:52:57,947 --> 00:53:04,239
it needs kinky sex...

301
00:53:04,439 --> 00:53:13,666
In order to be stimulated, when the layer which is manifesting is of a syphilitic

302
00:53:13,866 --> 00:53:24,829
condition, they are not happy, they are not satisfied with normal sex.

303
00:53:25,029 --> 00:53:34,766
They need something different. There comes sadism, masochism, homosexuality...

304
00:53:45,038 --> 00:53:52,764
all the deviations from normal sex.

305
00:54:01,161 --> 00:54:09,084
They are driven towards this direction. They have not a choice.

306
00:54:13,347 --> 00:54:30,823
It's driven to be because of the layer which is affecting the sexual sphere

307
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:38,996
and there in this area of the sexual sphere...

308
00:54:43,736 --> 00:54:50,059
That when the syphilitic miasm is active.

309
00:54:51,532 --> 00:55:01,731
That finding could be not a partner of the opposite sex. it can be a partner of

310
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:24,276
the same sex. These tendencies are inside the person. They fight them.

311
00:55:24,476 --> 00:55:43,731
In that inner fight in order to find an outlet to the suffering, they turn to religion

312
00:55:43,931 --> 00:56:01,168
and they find the outlet "unless I get out of this hell" there is an outlet for merging

313
00:56:01,368 --> 00:56:05,088
or contacting the Divine.

314
00:56:32,128 --> 00:56:42,105
If the person is on a syphilitic layer and chooses to have a partner, whether it's of

315
00:56:42,305 --> 00:56:53,619
the opposite sex or even of the same sex, because of being not balanced the person

316
00:56:53,819 --> 00:57:10,658
inside him, what happens is that he projects to this connection his own desires.

317
00:57:10,858 --> 00:57:23,226
That this partner is the best for me, he is absolutely the perfect human being

318
00:57:23,426 --> 00:57:32,218
and that, one day, leads to a tremendous disappointment because they found out

319
00:57:32,418 --> 00:57:43,036
he was not what they thought. Because of the syphilis underneath.

320
00:57:43,236 --> 00:57:50,906
And because they project it with their own imagination. Things do not really exist.

321
00:57:51,106 --> 00:57:58,688
The disappointment is very great and they are lead to suicidal thoughts or suicides.

322
00:58:05,678 --> 00:58:21,515
That is why I was saying that in order to be able the young people at the age of 20 -25

323
00:58:21,715 --> 00:58:28,799
to really fall in love and to enjoy this, they have to be healthy.

324
00:58:28,999 --> 00:58:41,928
Otherwise it is dangerous for a person, who is not balanced in his innermost self

325
00:58:42,128 --> 00:58:54,431
and who is under the influence of sycosis or syphilis, to fall in love really in the way

326
00:58:54,631 --> 00:59:00,556
where you give everything to the other person, you hand over.

327
00:59:00,756 --> 00:59:12,190
In a love affair, when it is full, you hand over your life to somebody else.

328
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:21,284
If you do that and you are not balanced, you are in for trouble.

329
00:59:25,587 --> 00:59:31,957
What's going to happen? Is your heart going to break down or is your mind going

330
00:59:32,157 --> 00:59:38,824
to break down? Are you going to commit suicide?

331
00:59:39,024 --> 00:59:51,090
It depends on the miasmatic condition on which you are under, which turn will take.

332
00:59:59,338 --> 01:00:12,045
Perhaps you have heard me saying that if somebody had gonorrhea, at the age of 20,

333
01:00:12,245 --> 01:00:27,054
and at the age of 48 there is a heart attack, I have said that this is due to the gonorrhea

334
01:00:27,254 --> 01:00:36,110
because the sycotic miasm affects a lot the heart as an organ

335
01:00:38,669 --> 01:00:46,319
and the weak point is the heart for a person who had gonorrhea.

336
01:00:46,519 --> 01:00:57,998
At that age of 48 he is married, he has children. At 30 he was married.

337
01:00:58,198 --> 01:01:04,418
He has now children that are 14, 15...20.

338
01:01:04,618 --> 01:01:12,753
But due to the excessive sexual desire

339
01:01:12,953 --> 01:01:23,779
that the gonorrhea has produced to this organism he is prone to

340
01:01:23,979 --> 01:01:38,724
fall in love with another woman. Around that age 48, 49, 50, 52.

341
01:01:38,924 --> 01:01:49,229
In such a case the action of the heart becomes full.

342
01:01:49,429 --> 01:01:58,887
They need in order to support the strong passions that have arisen, the heart works

343
01:01:59,087 --> 01:02:06,227
in full speed. That is the time when there is a heart infract and death occurs.

344
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:19,996
This is the full explanation why people with gonorrhea at the age of 20,

345
01:02:20,196 --> 01:02:28,954
if treated wrongly, it has been suppressed and especially if there is no condylomata

346
01:02:29,154 --> 01:02:36,290
manifesting after the treatment...

347
01:02:36,490 --> 01:02:49,457
If condylomata manifest after the gonorrhea treatment, it's a very good sign.

348
01:02:49,657 --> 01:03:00,522
The heart is spared. But if you keep on suppressing the condylomata and then

349
01:03:00,722 --> 01:03:06,952
the heart will give in. When will it give in?

350
01:03:07,152 --> 01:03:19,934
When it will have to give a full force of blood to the system.

351
01:03:20,134 --> 01:03:30,705
When you see a person whom you desire very much and you have a passion,

352
01:03:30,905 --> 01:03:42,361
the palpitation is tremendous. That is the dangerous moment.

353
01:03:57,206 --> 01:04:08,388
How much important it is that these miasms, the syphilis, the gonorrhea, psoric

354
01:04:08,588 --> 01:04:19,083
are not staying in the body? Which is the system that can help eradicate this miasm?

355
01:04:19,283 --> 01:04:25,347
Only Homeopathy. Which kind of Homeopathy?

356
01:04:25,547 --> 01:04:36,750
Not the Homeopathy where you prescribe 20 drugs or you have crazy ideas,

357
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:40,976
take this crazy remedy or another.

358
01:04:41,176 --> 01:04:48,719
This is a matter of creating a scientific investigation where you are trying to understand

359
01:04:48,919 --> 01:04:57,255
what has happened right through in the life of a person, what has been created as a

360
01:04:57,455 --> 01:05:08,742
complex within the organism and try in a scientific way to get rid of the layers

361
01:05:08,942 --> 01:05:19,434
one by one. And it is not good either to say "You are syphilitic, take Syphilinum".

362
01:05:22,383 --> 01:05:25,498
No, you take Syphilinum, if Syphilinum symptoms are there.

363
01:05:27,674 --> 01:05:34,996
But unless these symptoms are not there and you take Syphilinum, you damage

364
01:05:35,196 --> 01:05:52,236
yourself actually. Especially if you repeat. Or take Med. Unless Med. You take Thuja...

365
01:06:00,128 --> 01:06:07,765
You have to have the symptoms of the remedy. That's why I'm against of those people

366
01:06:07,965 --> 01:06:24,858
who teach when I have a case I always start with Tuberculinum

367
01:06:25,058 --> 01:06:32,594
because tuberculosis is usual in our society and then a dose of Syphilinum 10M

368
01:06:32,794 --> 01:06:41,344
and then Medorrhinum 10M and the Psorinum 10M.

369
01:06:41,544 --> 01:06:58,744
When I was in America they told me there was someone who was giving these

370
01:06:58,944 --> 01:07:03,238
remedies regularly and he was an Indian guru by the way.

371
01:07:03,438 --> 01:07:08,080
Who would say to a new comer, give him a dose of Tub 10M or several doses

372
01:07:08,522 --> 01:07:18,541
and then if the person still remained alive, then Syph. 10M for a period of time.

373
01:07:18,741 --> 01:07:27,476
To clear up the miasms. The medical doctor who came and told me this because

374
01:07:27,676 --> 01:07:36,938
he was forced by the guru to do this because he was the medical man responsible

375
01:07:37,138 --> 01:07:40,431
in this big affair with this guru.

376
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:48,622
Then I explained to him and said most probably these are the symptoms that you are

377
01:07:48,822 --> 01:07:54,821
getting now all these people. He says exactly.

378
01:07:59,803 --> 01:08:07,312
They were doing proving of these deep remedies upon all the people and as a result

379
01:08:07,512 --> 01:08:12,250
they had total confusion in the organism.

380
01:08:12,450 --> 01:08:17,549
He brought me cases that I could not make out anything.

381
01:08:27,508 --> 01:08:35,015
-When we have a case like a Med. case. A man who had gonorrhea in his youth and

382
01:08:35,215 --> 01:08:40,713
comes to us in older age with severe heart problems, under heavy allopathic

383
01:08:40,913 --> 01:08:49,408
medication and he is a clearly a Med. Case, what potency can we use of Med.?

384
01:09:00,806 --> 01:09:04,062
-The highest is 200CH, better 30CH.

385
01:09:04,759 --> 01:09:05,650
-Daily?

386
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:11,850
-If there is a heart problem, first you give one dose. See if there is any reaction and

387
01:09:12,050 --> 01:09:20,490
if there is one and then he is better for 20 days, then next time you may repeat more

388
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:22,543
times.

389
01:09:22,743 --> 01:09:27,656
-Even daily? Because of the allopathic medication which antidotes the homeopathic

390
01:09:27,856 --> 01:09:31,570
remedy.

391
01:09:33,205 --> 01:09:39,980
-The one dose, if the remedy is correct, will give a result but the result will remain

392
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:47,003
for 2 weeks. Then you start again and you give every day.

393
01:09:47,203 --> 01:09:50,955
-There is no fear of suppression?

394
01:09:51,155 --> 01:09:58,442
-No, but it depends on what the pathology is.

395
01:09:58,642 --> 01:10:08,692
If the arteries are closed due to arteriosclerosis, then you have to go slowly,

396
01:10:08,892 --> 01:10:13,303
not to produce a big reaction.

397
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:17,140
-Can we give the remedy less often?

398
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:22,694
-As long as he takes the allopathic drug.

399
01:10:22,894 --> 01:10:29,873
If you can reduce the allopathic drugs, you may reduce the homeopathic as well.

400
01:10:35,448 --> 01:10:41,226
-If I understand you correctly, you said in syphilis if there are layers of miasms in

401
01:10:41,426 --> 01:10:48,626
the body, then they will be like that syphilis in the very bottom and

402
01:10:48,826 --> 01:10:57,157
if you remove it from the bottom, then sycosis will come up.

403
01:10:57,357 --> 01:11:05,045
A while ago, I think last year you said you know how some homeopaths believe that

404
01:11:05,245 --> 01:11:11,516
tuberculosis is made out of syphilis and psora or syphilis made out of psora

405
01:11:11,716 --> 01:11:18,426
and sycosis and I remember you said this is not true because then if you give

406
01:11:18,626 --> 01:11:24,625
something to treat tuberculosis, then syphilis would come up.

407
01:11:24,825 --> 01:11:27,194
Isn't that what you said?

408
01:11:27,394 --> 01:11:32,618
-Yes, that's correct. I just simply refer to the 3 miasms.

409
01:11:32,818 --> 01:11:40,669
Actually they are not only 3 miasms. The tubercular is a miasm by itself.

410
01:11:44,782 --> 01:11:48,541
-They say for example that tuberculosis is made out of psora...

411
01:11:48,741 --> 01:11:56,323
-No, I cannot say that. I gave the definition of the miasm.

412
01:11:56,523 --> 01:12:02,383
The definition is that you have to have an infecting agent first.

413
01:12:02,583 --> 01:12:18,312
Then you have to have the fact that this infective agent stays within the body

414
01:12:18,512 --> 01:12:29,041
and when he has children, the children get the predisposition to the disease.

415
01:12:29,241 --> 01:12:39,923
This is characteristic of syphilis and gonorrhea and also of tuberculosis.

416
01:12:40,123 --> 01:12:51,115
And then we can call it a separate tubercular miasm. For all practical purposes.

417
01:12:51,315 --> 01:13:04,747
What else can be a kind of a miasm? If there are such sequences.

418
01:13:04,947 --> 01:13:11,102
That means an infective agent that stays within the body and transmits to

419
01:13:11,302 --> 01:13:21,343
the new generation and then this pathology of the new generation is given

420
01:13:21,543 --> 01:13:31,361
the original remedy that caused and cures,

421
01:13:31,561 --> 01:13:34,849
then you may say that this is a miasm.

422
01:13:35,049 --> 01:13:42,507
But you have to have the infection, the possibility to transmit it

423
01:13:42,707 --> 01:13:50,513
that means staying in the genetic predisposition of the person and give it to the

424
01:13:50,713 --> 01:13:57,873
children and the children have to be treated and cured by the original agent.

425
01:13:58,073 --> 01:14:04,804
If that happens which is true, it happens with tuberculosis

426
01:14:05,004 --> 01:14:09,901
then we can say we have another tubercular miasm.

427
01:14:15,730 --> 01:14:27,011
But I don't know which other pathology we may consider as a miasmatic condition.

428
01:14:39,990 --> 01:14:52,139
-Before you said that the case of the colitis and the asthma, if it returns because

429
01:14:52,339 --> 01:15:16,539
his wife left him and colitis reappeared, we have not to give Calc. but Ign.

430
01:15:16,739 --> 01:15:22,665
This is because of an acute disease.

431
01:15:22,865 --> 01:15:34,378
-Exactly. On chronic state there is an acute, you have to treat first this and

432
01:15:34,578 --> 01:15:36,557
then the chronic.

433
01:15:36,757 --> 01:15:41,672
-And then the layer of primary psora.

434
01:15:41,872 --> 01:15:44,152
-Which country you come from?

435
01:15:44,352 --> 01:16:08,021
-Italy. I have another question. You say that it's not a choice to have a partner.

436
01:16:08,221 --> 01:16:22,339
-It's a compulsion. It is like a compulsive tendency that cannot be resisted

437
01:16:22,539 --> 01:16:33,690
when the syphilitic action is there and the person is under this and affecting

438
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:45,163
the sexual sphere, it's a compulsion. They need to do it in this way.

439
01:16:45,363 --> 01:16:49,244
-But we can say that for all mental symptoms? That is not a choice?

440
01:16:49,444 --> 01:16:51,802
-Yes, sure.

441
01:16:52,002 --> 01:16:54,787
-So irritability it's not a choice.

442
01:16:54,987 --> 01:17:00,289
-Irritability is not a choice, angriness is not a choice.

443
01:17:00,489 --> 01:17:12,270
It's something that leads you to hit the other person...It's a hormonal mixture.

444
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:17,076
-It's like an automatic response.

445
01:17:17,276 --> 01:17:30,948
-Yes. Also our social behavior is a matter of hormones, a matter of miasms.

446
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:46,419
-I have maybe a strange question but I want to see your way of thinking.

447
01:17:46,619 --> 01:17:52,233
I very much agree with the idea that if you have a syphilitic background, it will be

448
01:17:52,433 --> 01:17:59,943
this kind of distorted sexual attractions, homosexuality...

449
01:18:00,143 --> 01:18:06,647
On the other hand we agree with the idea that animals and especially

450
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:11,220
the wild animals are healthy. They select by nature...

451
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:19,985
I've seen several times in movies with biology subject homosexual tendencies

452
01:18:20,185 --> 01:18:29,182
in animals like frogs, deers... How could you explain this?

453
01:18:29,382 --> 01:18:39,976
-There are different ways to explain. I don't know if you know this experiment

454
01:18:40,176 --> 01:18:56,157
with pesticides that was affecting the behavior of animals becoming homosexual.

455
01:18:56,357 --> 01:19:04,217
No pollution, yes I'll go to that.

456
01:19:04,417 --> 01:19:27,063
Because what happens today, let's say the perversion or the sexual preference,

457
01:19:27,263 --> 01:19:36,966
it is exploding. Everybody knows that this is a phenomenon that is absolutely

458
01:19:37,166 --> 01:19:47,264
diffused all over, especially the civilized societies.

459
01:19:47,464 --> 01:20:01,561
Why these civilized societies? What is the difference between the civilized society

460
01:20:01,761 --> 01:20:09,032
having such a percentage and the primitive societies they have very little percentage?

461
01:20:09,232 --> 01:20:18,376
What is the difference? It's in the fact that we have damaged ourselves quite deeply

462
01:20:18,576 --> 01:20:29,034
on that level, especially the reproductive area.

463
01:20:29,234 --> 01:20:46,890
Now why they found such animals also to have this? This is a possibility.

464
01:20:47,090 --> 01:21:01,151
That's why when the organism is disturbed by a miasm, then it can take this way.

465
01:21:01,351 --> 01:21:09,068
There is a possibility in the nature of living beings to be.

466
01:21:09,268 --> 01:21:21,937
The more civilized, the more the tendency. What is the tendency?

467
01:21:22,137 --> 01:21:43,361
From a spiritual point of view, it is the tendency of the humans to get away from

468
01:21:43,561 --> 01:21:55,289
this incompleteness with which we come to this world. We need the opposite.

469
01:21:55,489 --> 01:22:08,005
So what you may be asking is a society in which we will not have

470
01:22:08,205 --> 01:22:20,132
this problem of being incomplete. What could be? A society where the 2 sexes

471
01:22:20,332 --> 01:22:29,125
would be equally active in the human organism.

472
01:22:29,325 --> 01:22:40,241
So spiritually the tendency is to feel complete in yourself.

473
01:23:41,432 --> 01:24:05,167
Is there anybody that does not want to hear? ...  what can I do?

474
01:24:10,632 --> 01:24:19,546
We have to decide whether we talk about these issues as a matter of information

475
01:24:19,746 --> 01:24:30,923
within a group of specialists, as homeopaths, or we hide and we bypass this issue.

476
01:24:31,123 --> 01:24:38,463
And the issue is whether what I say is correct or not.

477
01:24:38,663 --> 01:24:46,189
If it is correct, maybe accept it. If it is not correct, then reject it.

478
01:24:46,389 --> 01:24:56,275
You may have the possibility to disagree with what I say.

479
01:24:56,475 --> 01:25:01,888
This is not correct for these reasons.

480
01:25:02,088 --> 01:25:16,289
I understand that this may be a sensitive issue but giving at the same time

481
01:25:16,489 --> 01:25:23,894
the information and the explanation of what is happening.

482
01:25:27,191 --> 01:25:35,527
Perhaps you did not understand that what I said is that this tendency of

483
01:25:35,727 --> 01:25:55,143
a human being having inside both sexes is a spiritual state that may reach humanity

484
01:25:55,343 --> 01:25:58,879
in 2000 years.

485
01:25:59,079 --> 01:26:11,857
And goes through that state at this moment which is not really the best state but

486
01:26:12,057 --> 01:26:21,828
the tendency is that the human being must free himself from suffering.

487
01:26:22,028 --> 01:26:28,646
And the suffering is because we are not complete.

488
01:26:28,846 --> 01:26:40,894
We need something to complete us. For a man it can be a woman or for a man

489
01:26:41,094 --> 01:26:45,723
can be another friend or for a woman it can be another woman...

490
01:26:45,923 --> 01:27:01,418
But this is the need and I say that in this need you are going to have some problems.

491
01:27:01,618 --> 01:27:10,320
When the other person, whom you trusted so much will tell you bye-bye,

492
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:12,697
I don't agree with you.

493
01:27:12,897 --> 01:27:20,276
That means you have projected in the other person qualities that there are not

494
01:27:20,476 --> 01:27:33,469
there. You are going to treat patients and you must understand

495
01:27:33,669 --> 01:27:37,693
what you are treating and why there is a blockage...

496
01:27:37,893 --> 01:27:45,005
Unless this is clear, how can you find out and help?

497
01:27:47,819 --> 01:27:58,440
If somebody is over-sexed, especially a woman, she is in tremendous need for

498
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:19,971
sexual contact, nymphomaniac, can I speak about nymphomaniacs?

499
01:28:20,171 --> 01:28:34,720
Why not? If a woman is driven by her hormonal imbalance in that state,

500
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:53,114
you are going to help her by giving a remedy that will reduce her sexual pleasure.

501
01:28:53,314 --> 01:29:02,429
You get a woman who needs Platina, she comes there for headaches she does not

502
01:29:02,629 --> 01:29:07,377
tell you about her sexuality.

503
01:29:07,577 --> 01:29:13,080
You did not ask, you did not know. You give Plat. and when she comes she says

504
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:27,382
what have you done? My pleasure is gone. I don't need so much sexual activity

505
01:29:27,582 --> 01:29:35,766
anymore. Ok what do you want? You want your sexual activity and your headaches

506
01:29:37,434 --> 01:29:43,981
or you want a better balance with no headaches and less sexual activity?

507
01:29:44,181 --> 01:29:53,341
I had such a case. She said does your remedy have to do with the reduction?

508
01:29:53,541 --> 01:30:10,819
I said no. This woman she called me about a month ago and she said

509
01:30:11,019 --> 01:30:13,998
can you please give me the remedy you gave me for the headaches?

510
01:30:14,198 --> 01:30:21,544
I was feeling so well. But it had reduced her sexual activity to the extent that

511
01:30:21,744 --> 01:30:30,802
she complained the next time she came here. She is in my age.

512
01:30:31,002 --> 01:30:39,895
She says give me this because I have the anxiety. She says I have taken the remedy

513
01:30:40,095 --> 01:30:46,234
several times but the last time I took it, it didn't work.

514
01:30:46,434 --> 01:30:54,770
I asked what potency you took? Take a higher potency now. You cannot avoid that.

515
01:30:54,970 --> 01:31:05,821
You cannot say Ok I like it and I don't want to lose this pleasure...

516
01:31:06,021 --> 01:31:11,770
You are going to bring about balance to the organism as a whole.

517
01:31:11,970 --> 01:31:20,374
If this is not accepted, then this is not the fault of the homeopath.

518
01:31:21,614 --> 01:31:29,033
-If we say that mental and physical symptoms are automatic response

519
01:31:29,233 --> 01:31:38,614
to external information, can we say that psychosomatic medicine cannot exist?

520
01:31:38,814 --> 01:31:46,039
-No, wait a moment. Psychosomatic medicine, I don't know exactly what you mean.

521
01:31:46,239 --> 01:31:59,086
But the fact that a psychological state can be transmitted into the physical body

522
01:31:59,286 --> 01:32:09,404
this is a fact. If you say psychosomatic medicine is this kind of treatment,

523
01:32:09,604 --> 01:32:12,389
I don't know what you mean.

524
01:32:12,589 --> 01:32:18,376
-I mean that mental symptoms can cause physical symptoms.

525
01:32:18,576 --> 01:32:32,296
-Yes mental symptoms can be transformed into physical symptoms. It is fact 100%.

526
01:32:32,496 --> 01:32:42,647
I thought it was a kind of treatment you mean.

527
01:32:44,202 --> 01:32:52,315
But whatever treatment, if a mental symptom is transferred to the physical body

528
01:32:52,515 --> 01:33:00,425
is a correct treatment. And vice versa.

529
01:33:00,625 --> 01:33:06,937
If you treat the physical and goes to the mental, this is not correct treatment.

530
01:33:07,137 --> 01:33:14,053
So psychosomatic idea of medicine is correct.

531
01:33:14,253 --> 01:33:24,283
Treating is correct when it has the right direction. From deeper to more outer.
