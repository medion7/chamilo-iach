1
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:45,043
Paragraph 88, "If in these voluntary details
nothing has been mentioned respecting

2
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:54,088
several parts or functions of the body
or his metal state, the physician asks

3
00:00:54,655 --> 00:01:01,111
what more can be told in regard to
these parts and these functions,

4
00:01:01,783 --> 00:01:14,143
or the state of his disposition of mind,
but in doing this he only makes use of

5
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:23,543
general expressions, in order that his
informants may be obliged to enter into

6
00:01:23,976 --> 00:01:27,568
special details
concerning them."

7
00:01:34,096 --> 00:01:45,103
He says if you have not asked or he
has not spoken about certain areas

8
00:01:45,895 --> 00:01:53,896
the doctor should ask about such areas
especially concerning the mental condition

9
00:01:54,336 --> 00:02:03,288
and disposition and put the question
in such a way, in a general way,

10
00:02:03,807 --> 00:02:11,119
so the patient may elaborate
on this by himself.

11
00:02:15,728 --> 00:02:25,840
Par. 89, "When the patient (for it is on him
we have chiefly to rely for a description

12
00:02:26,575 --> 00:02:41,431
of his sensations, except in the case of
feigned diseases) has by these details,

13
00:02:41,839 --> 00:02:51,016
given of his own accord"
It's very important.

14
00:02:51,544 --> 00:02:59,960
If somebody will voluntarily give information,
that information you underline it.

15
00:03:00,735 --> 00:03:08,505
It is clear information so you have to
underline it and you have to rely on it.

16
00:03:14,588 --> 00:03:23,405
"... of his own accord and in answer to
inquiries, furnished the requisite information

17
00:03:23,788 --> 00:03:30,011
and traced a tolerably perfect
picture of the disease,

18
00:03:32,284 --> 00:03:35,759
the physician is at liberty and obliged (if
he feels he has not yet gained all the

19
00:03:37,824 --> 00:03:43,271
information he needs) to ask more
precise, more special questions."

20
00:03:52,791 --> 00:04:00,382
If the patient has given "a tolerably
perfect picture of the disease"...

21
00:04:05,383 --> 00:04:11,535
If the patient has given more or less
a complete picture of his disease,

22
00:04:12,344 --> 00:04:25,184
the doctor is obliged to ask more
precise information about his disease.

23
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:38,760
Par. 90, "When the physician has
finished writing down these particulars,

24
00:04:40,303 --> 00:04:47,735
he then makes a note of what he
himself observes in the patient,

25
00:04:48,616 --> 00:04:59,105
and ascertains how much of that was peculiar
to the patient in his healthy state."

26
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:13,423
If the doctor observes something on the
patient, for instance the patient is sitting

27
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:21,511
all the time and moving and is restless, is
making gesture, tics, closes his eyes etc.

28
00:05:23,088 --> 00:05:33,312
he must ask him since what time do you
do this? Do you remember when you

29
00:05:33,647 --> 00:05:46,615
started being restless? When
did I start getting restless?

30
00:05:49,072 --> 00:05:54,703
One time I did an
experiment with the class.

31
00:05:55,247 --> 00:06:06,503
I said I have been teaching (the Greek
doctors) you for years and now I want

32
00:06:06,872 --> 00:06:15,920
you to write down all my symptoms.
What you have observed as symptoms.

33
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:20,799
It was a total failure.

34
00:06:27,175 --> 00:06:35,863
One he observed correctly and
he wrote down my symptoms.

35
00:06:38,143 --> 00:06:44,775
All the others were projections
of their imagination.

36
00:06:55,831 --> 00:07:07,560
The best way to teach Homeopathy would
be always to have the people around

37
00:07:08,024 --> 00:07:18,752
and the patient and for everything that
I observe, I could ask each one of them

38
00:07:19,327 --> 00:07:21,855
to tell me what do you observe?

39
00:07:22,239 --> 00:07:31,278
Sometimes I come in the class and I say
do you observe the eyes of this person?

40
00:07:31,871 --> 00:07:35,911
Yes. What did you see?

41
00:07:37,719 --> 00:07:47,887
In his eye there is a great sadness, how
many in the class saw sadness? Only 10%.

42
00:07:49,383 --> 00:07:54,679
But for me it is so obvious.
How can you not see it?

43
00:08:04,455 --> 00:08:13,031
Observation is a
matter of detachment.

44
00:08:15,055 --> 00:08:29,375
That means the doctor must never be
attached to the patient in any way.

45
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:39,663
Because here enters a nice woman and
you are a man and you like women and

46
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:46,999
immediately your natural
instinct is to like that person.

47
00:08:47,767 --> 00:08:52,303
From that moment onwards
forget taking a correct case.

48
00:08:52,664 --> 00:08:56,903
You cannot get an
objective case.

49
00:08:58,495 --> 00:09:07,207
You are going to write down your impression
about this person. How nice she is...

50
00:09:08,671 --> 00:09:16,994
One time one of my doctors in Athens, they
were giving me their cases in the night

51
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:24,795
for me to prescribe on the paper. So I
prescribed very quickly, I read and I prescribe.

52
00:09:25,235 --> 00:09:36,763
I have to prescribe 30-40 cases at the end of
the day. I read this, it's a nice young man,

53
00:09:37,155 --> 00:09:48,468
(she's a very good looking doctor) so I
understood from the paper they like each other.

54
00:09:49,556 --> 00:10:00,164
So I wrote her you have to re-take
the case and stop flirting with him.

55
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:16,363
She retook the case and she was amazed
to find out that this was a manic

56
00:10:16,771 --> 00:10:22,323
depression case. Where it was a simple
case of a nice man who had some itching

57
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:27,730
in the nose... Nothing! There
was nothing in the case.

58
00:10:28,171 --> 00:10:31,091
Why this man came to be treated?

59
00:10:33,763 --> 00:10:43,602
When she really investigated, being detached
and observing, she found out he was

60
00:10:43,924 --> 00:10:54,818
mentally very disturbed. These people who
are bipolars, manic depressive cases...

61
00:10:56,058 --> 00:11:04,537
in their manic state they are wonderful
people with a lot of fascination for others

62
00:11:04,961 --> 00:11:13,017
because the energy is flowing and they
can be so expressive and can say things...

63
00:11:13,394 --> 00:11:22,730
And unless you sit back and realize they are
overdoing it because it is very obvious

64
00:11:23,569 --> 00:11:29,729
they are going over the board in their
expression, you realize that they are

65
00:11:30,234 --> 00:11:31,857
mentally disturbed.

66
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:43,025
So in order to take a good
case, you have to be detached.

67
00:11:43,729 --> 00:11:50,256
Detached does not mean that you are
not interested about the case.

68
00:11:50,673 --> 00:12:07,857
You are interested about the case but not
about the person as an erotic friend.

69
00:12:09,057 --> 00:12:15,633
You are interested about his passions,
his disease and you want to help him.

70
00:12:15,953 --> 00:12:21,185
If your mind is concentrated on this
line, you cannot fall to the other side.

71
00:12:25,129 --> 00:12:39,690
Because a lot of patients especially women
towards men they try to seduce the doctor

72
00:12:40,489 --> 00:12:49,513
by playing nice.... They perceive immediately
whether a doctor likes them or not and

73
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:56,281
then they handle it. And once
they get involved, a homeopath...

74
00:12:56,914 --> 00:13:12,722
A M.D., doesn't matter. He knows that in
duodenal ulcer he has to prescribe that

75
00:13:13,105 --> 00:13:15,441
medicine and finish.

76
00:13:15,842 --> 00:13:22,121
But for a homeopath who tries to
understand the picture of the pathology

77
00:13:22,537 --> 00:13:34,122
in a human being, understand how deep it
is, you have really to be on your guard

78
00:13:34,449 --> 00:13:41,177
all the time. And immediately you perceive
that the woman tries to seduce you.

79
00:13:41,489 --> 00:13:44,929
So you handle it,
otherwise you fall.

80
00:13:54,625 --> 00:14:02,145
And then you fail... As I
was saying to Frederick...

81
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:16,898
We were talking before and I said to
him how is it possible that Homeopathy

82
00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:29,193
in Greece is going upwards all the time, how
is it possible that we have 3 hospitals

83
00:14:29,585 --> 00:14:40,679
carrying clinical research with the consent
of the doctors in the hospitals,

84
00:14:41,063 --> 00:14:49,390
the directors of the hospitals. 3
public hospitals are running this.

85
00:14:49,808 --> 00:14:58,416
We have a University where M.D.
can get a master's degree.

86
00:14:58,823 --> 00:15:05,927
How is it possible that the media, the
media are crazy for me to go to media

87
00:15:06,264 --> 00:15:12,231
and speak, you know how many invitations I
have received, I said no, I don't come.

88
00:15:14,263 --> 00:15:22,760
How is that possible that the Greek doctors
at this moment who are my students,

89
00:15:23,544 --> 00:15:34,603
one of them is Katie, they have no
problem with their patients

90
00:15:35,171 --> 00:15:51,107
during such a financial crisis in Greece and the
patients are paying from their own pocket?

91
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:58,115
All the Greek patients going to Homeopathy
they pay from their own pocket.

92
00:15:58,482 --> 00:16:02,458
They don't rely on insurance.

93
00:16:06,274 --> 00:16:14,318
All my old students have become rich. How
is that possible that in England

94
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:22,102
things are going down, in Belgium things
are going down homeopathically.

95
00:16:22,447 --> 00:16:26,687
In America, even in Germany.

96
00:16:29,206 --> 00:16:40,335
They tell me in England a lot of homeopaths
are closing down their practices, 50%.

97
00:16:41,175 --> 00:16:45,750
But some good ones will stay.

98
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:59,663
Homeopathy relies on the prestige which
is produced by those good homeopaths

99
00:16:59,967 --> 00:17:08,855
who have effect. How can you have an effect
if you do crazy things,

100
00:17:09,198 --> 00:17:14,846
if you have crazy fantasies, if you play
around with the patients?

101
00:17:19,023 --> 00:17:30,001
This is a science, which I consider the highest
in the field of Medicine, but requires

102
00:17:31,105 --> 00:17:43,625
personalities that are quite complete in
their understanding of the human suffering.

103
00:17:52,353 --> 00:17:53,712
Speak out.

104
00:17:56,256 --> 00:18:02,736
-I want to ask you about the detachment
you said before between the patient and the doctor.

105
00:18:03,803 --> 00:18:11,308
Does it include only
erotic emotions or also friendship?

106
00:18:12,164 --> 00:18:21,723
Sometimes there is a problem and the
doctor must stop taking the case...

107
00:18:22,099 --> 00:18:35,547
-Sure. To treat a friend is equally difficult.
Because your old-time friend has an idea about you

108
00:18:35,979 --> 00:18:42,867
and you have an idea about him
and you can't see him as a fresh new case.

109
00:18:44,788 --> 00:18:50,972
This is the difficulty also with treating
your wife, your children, mother and father.

110
00:18:51,532 --> 00:18:59,780
This is a real problem as well. And the
biggest problem is treating yourself.

111
00:19:09,868 --> 00:19:17,636
Because it's very difficult to see objectively
and to see that these are the points

112
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:24,892
which are pathological and do
not belong to the personality.

113
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:29,628
I have a personality, if you take my
personality and you describe it

114
00:19:30,645 --> 00:19:34,197
because I took that medicine, it's
totally wrong.

115
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:42,317
But there are some points in my mental/
emotional structure which are gone beyond,

116
00:19:45,045 --> 00:19:48,214
then you have to
find out and use them.

117
00:19:53,252 --> 00:20:03,293
Shall I put you in the test of
observation and write down my symptoms?

118
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:17,109
...which is something I actually need... I
don't see you are willing to do it.

119
00:20:18,521 --> 00:20:21,873
-I know something from
yesterday; heat aggravates.

120
00:20:25,729 --> 00:20:45,752
-Heat aggravates. Desire for hot drinks. This
is an impression. I like cold drinks as well.

121
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,920
Another? Sensitive to draft.

122
00:21:00,193 --> 00:21:10,201
Correct, especially when I have
a cold or I am under an acute.

123
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:16,010
Michael? I thought you
want to say something...

124
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:35,169
A problem with digestion. Yes,
I have said too much actually.

125
00:21:37,768 --> 00:21:51,977
Desire chocolate. Sweets, in general
and meat. Moving my right leg.

126
00:21:55,825 --> 00:22:00,760
-As far as I understood you have sleeplessness
when you are excited in your mind.

127
00:22:03,273 --> 00:22:09,777
-Especially when I have a crowd
here waiting for me the next day.

128
00:22:13,536 --> 00:22:22,120
This is something which I have
all along the years of my life.

129
00:22:22,417 --> 00:22:31,833
Only this year I managed to control it.
That's why I am still alive I think.

130
00:22:34,712 --> 00:22:39,744
I sleep quite well now for
the last 9-10 months.

131
00:22:42,953 --> 00:22:49,096
I was never able to sleep when I
had something important to do.

132
00:22:54,441 --> 00:22:57,217
Good observations.

133
00:22:57,548 --> 00:22:59,139
-You hate flies.

134
00:23:06,356 --> 00:23:14,941
-Yes, that is true but not to the extent
I pretend to do it because I am playing with that.

135
00:23:18,827 --> 00:23:25,875
A good observation would have
been you pretend you do not like flies

136
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:31,748
and you play with that. That
is a more deep observation.

137
00:23:32,668 --> 00:23:38,980
Because when you have to sit
down for almost 2 hours here...

138
00:23:39,644 --> 00:23:50,876
the span of attention of a normal brain
is 10 minutes, then stops and then again.

139
00:23:53,531 --> 00:24:03,452
The normal course of a lecture should
never be more than 45 minutes.

140
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:11,115
We made you sit here -because we want
to give you much information

141
00:24:11,723 --> 00:24:21,236
- 2 hours in a row without interval.
This is really criminal.

142
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:36,148
Therefore I have to say things to enliven
you, stories...

143
00:24:36,564 --> 00:24:42,564
Otherwise serious lecture for 2 hours every one 
will be sleeping in the end of the hour.

144
00:25:07,351 --> 00:25:15,166
The observation should not be desire
warm drinks, easy dehydration.

145
00:25:16,687 --> 00:25:20,615
I dehydrate easily
and I need liquids.

146
00:25:27,334 --> 00:25:46,238
In 1980 there was here a meeting of
all the people

147
00:25:46,534 --> 00:25:50,926
who do research in the
homeopathic world.

148
00:25:51,487 --> 00:25:56,183
I brought them all here, I
had a rich patient

149
00:25:56,551 --> 00:26:03,102
who paid their expenses and
we had discussions.

150
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:14,127
During this time Alonissos
had no ferry boats,

151
00:26:14,567 --> 00:26:20,638
there were some boats
coming from time to time.

152
00:26:23,822 --> 00:26:30,598
I took the responsibility to invite
the people here and between them

153
00:26:30,983 --> 00:26:33,871
it was Benveniste.

154
00:26:40,326 --> 00:26:50,903
We had discussions and one night at
about 1.00 a.m. somebody comes to

155
00:26:51,247 --> 00:27:00,855
my house and says Benveniste has a
heart attack. And he's lying in a room

156
00:27:01,311 --> 00:27:13,535
in Roussoum without telephone, without the
possibility of having any transportation

157
00:27:13,934 --> 00:27:26,175
to take him to any hospital and Peter
Fisher was here, he is the editor

158
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:34,094
of Homeopathy in England.
-He treats the Queen.

159
00:27:34,975 --> 00:27:44,192
-Yes he's treating the Queen now. Then Dr.
Elliot was Queen's physician

160
00:27:45,854 --> 00:27:57,687
who was here then, Dr. Reilly was here
and about 20 - 25 people were here.

161
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:06,942
Anyhow, 1 a.m. they come and tell
me Benveniste has a heart attack.

162
00:28:09,055 --> 00:28:20,951
It's Peter Fisher, Dr. Reilly, they woke
up and one more, I can't remember, and

163
00:28:21,414 --> 00:28:32,295
myself we go back and I see Benveniste is
lying there, he knew that he had a problem

164
00:28:32,655 --> 00:28:37,847
with his heart, he was M.D.
he understood.

165
00:28:38,375 --> 00:28:52,663
He had a heart infarct, he had pain and he
was lying totally immovable in the bed,

166
00:28:53,727 --> 00:29:09,007
with pain, closed eyes and at 1.30 a.m. I
asked his wife, she gave me a little bit

167
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:13,214
of information but I
had what I could see.

168
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:29,575
I said to Peter and to
David he needs Ars. 200CH.

169
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,095
Immediately there
was a reaction.

170
00:29:35,127 --> 00:29:41,806
He does not move, no restlessness,
where did you find the Ars.?

171
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:56,399
I said you did not see his eyelids. They
were trembling, he had them closed but

172
00:29:56,767 --> 00:30:07,431
trembling constantly. You did not
observe that being a medical doctor,

173
00:30:08,551 --> 00:30:14,375
he knows the problem being in an isolated
place, he has a heart attack, he does not

174
00:30:14,742 --> 00:30:28,608
have access to any hospital, so he feels
his time has come and that he will die

175
00:30:29,007 --> 00:30:34,934
in Alonissos and he keeps
totally imnmovable.

176
00:30:35,254 --> 00:30:42,198
Because being a M.D. knows that in
a heart infarct he must not move.

177
00:30:42,639 --> 00:30:50,198
You must keep quite. No matter how much
pain you have, the best thing to do is not

178
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:58,078
to give extra work to your heart,
so you have to stay still.

179
00:30:59,911 --> 00:31:05,887
That is why. I said he has great anxiety
about his health, he has fear of death,

180
00:31:06,902 --> 00:31:15,390
there is restlessness but the restlessness
appears only in his lids, the time is 2.00 a.m.

181
00:31:15,895 --> 00:31:26,671
we know the aggravation time for Ars. is
between 1-3 a.m. give a dose of Ars. 200CH.

182
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:39,951
He took the Ars. 200. I waited until he
fell asleep and then I left at about 3 a.m.

183
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:50,743
Then we had to meet the group at 9 a.m.
and I passed to see him before going to

184
00:31:51,103 --> 00:31:57,815
the group to see how he is because there
was no possibility for him to move.

185
00:31:59,863 --> 00:32:15,549
It was 7.30 a.m. I was without sleep. I asked
the wife how he is, she said he is still sleeping.

186
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:19,004
I said this is a
good sign, he is not dead.

187
00:32:24,092 --> 00:32:38,372
I left and I came to the class where
we met and there was great anxiety.

188
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:43,172
In the group nobody spoke. All the
responsibility was with Mr. Vithoulkas,

189
00:32:43,892 --> 00:32:49,556
he treated the case. You
understand the situation,

190
00:32:50,061 --> 00:33:00,389
nobody accused me or said anything but still
I felt the heaviness of the atmosphere.

191
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:13,478
In the meantime he had asked, when we
were there,

192
00:33:18,302 --> 00:33:24,253
to leave immediately with the first boat 
the next day in the morning,

193
00:33:25,493 --> 00:33:32,021
to get a ticket so he can leave Alonissos and go to Volos.

194
00:33:35,486 --> 00:33:47,670
I think it was about 9.30 a.m. when we saw
him coming to the class to participate

195
00:33:48,078 --> 00:34:01,518
in the discussion. He says I feel quite
alright now and I am not going to leave.

196
00:34:02,222 --> 00:34:05,590
He had the possibility
to leave Alonissos.

197
00:34:06,622 --> 00:34:15,124
Not only his heart infarct was resolved
but his anxiety and the fear of death

198
00:34:15,644 --> 00:34:24,821
was minimized. He continued and stayed
all along till we finished the week

199
00:34:25,156 --> 00:34:31,051
of the works we had to do without
any problem and then he left.

200
00:34:32,636 --> 00:34:42,900
If I did not have the observation and
if my observation was not correct and

201
00:34:43,187 --> 00:34:50,772
I did not put things together, I could
have given all other remedies except Ars.

202
00:34:53,428 --> 00:35:07,092
And maybe ending up in a tragedy or
in a very bad fame for Homeopathy.

203
00:35:13,068 --> 00:35:23,556
This is how I learn with my master Mr.
Hahnemann., I learned what to do.

204
00:35:26,548 --> 00:35:36,724
When I read the Organon I thought it was
the easiest book to read ever in my life

205
00:35:37,019 --> 00:35:38,283
and the most interesting.

206
00:35:39,196 --> 00:35:43,730
When I asked the Germans later on, my
students, they said Organon

207
00:35:44,915 --> 00:35:59,362
 is very difficult book to understand.
Long sentences, obscure ideas.

208
00:35:59,986 --> 00:36:08,746
For me it was unbelievable. I was in state
of excitement when I was reading it.

209
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:13,402
And I read it right through
one time and never again.

210
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:19,482
From time to time when I had to teach,
I will open one paragraph and maybe

211
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:25,545
I will speak. But never read like I
am trying now for a second time.

212
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:38,307
In the beginning and in the end they
say to complete the understanding.

213
00:36:39,674 --> 00:36:52,387
Paragraph 90, "When the physician has
finished writing down these particulars,

214
00:36:52,994 --> 00:36:59,017
he then makes a note of what he himself
observes in the patient, and ascertains

215
00:36:59,427 --> 00:37:05,514
how much of that was peculiar to
the patient in his healthy state."

216
00:37:06,114 --> 00:37:14,530
It is true that next day I ask
Benveniste about the restlessness.

217
00:37:15,154 --> 00:37:24,171
He says internally I felt very restless but
I knew I should not move and that's why

218
00:37:24,506 --> 00:37:26,674
I was keeping so quite.

219
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:48,913
So you have a chance to ask
whatever you like now.

220
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:59,858
On the Organon, outside of the Organon,
anything that comes to your mind

221
00:38:01,186 --> 00:38:04,521
except of one thing...

222
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:22,433
-I wanted to ask the following; we had a
very interesting topic with Mr. Schroyens

223
00:38:23,097 --> 00:38:31,794
concerning the topic when two opposite
symptoms occur in a patient and normally

224
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:35,266
I have the impression...

225
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:39,593
-Two opposite symptoms
in the patient?

226
00:38:40,529 --> 00:38:41,657
-Yes.

227
00:38:43,201 --> 00:38:45,393
-Can you give me an example?

228
00:38:48,841 --> 00:38:56,552
-2-3 weeks ago, I had a patient that she
said to me that when there was cold

229
00:38:56,873 --> 00:39:01,825
and wet weather she hated it and she had
some pains in the back and everything

230
00:39:02,137 --> 00:39:09,049
is aggravated from cold and wet. After 5
minutes she told me in general she has

231
00:39:09,376 --> 00:39:15,384
aversion to heat and she doesn't like hot
weather and she's aggravated by being

232
00:39:15,777 --> 00:39:26,546
warm in a room. First I saw a Rhus
tox thing and then Pulsatilla.

233
00:39:28,008 --> 00:39:33,344
When I repertorised I can go to this
or what we said today to this point...

234
00:39:38,553 --> 00:39:45,352
The truth was that in this case I thought
the uppermost layer was Rhus tox because

235
00:39:45,681 --> 00:39:52,953
cold was bothering her the most and below
there was a Pulsatilla thing from her older

236
00:39:53,425 --> 00:39:59,249
state. My question is now this can
come very frequently like this.

237
00:39:59,641 --> 00:40:03,072
-You answered to the question. The
question whether this is frequent or not;

238
00:40:03,433 --> 00:40:11,265
this is not frequent. But it is a fact it can
be aggravated on one set of symptoms and

239
00:40:11,464 --> 00:40:16,312
can be ameliorated another set of
symptoms with the opposite conditions.

240
00:40:16,777 --> 00:40:19,514
This can happen but
not very frequently.

241
00:40:19,881 --> 00:40:24,369
-So you mean it is more frequent that
this is existing in one remedy that

242
00:40:24,729 --> 00:40:26,977
the opposite symptoms
are present.

243
00:40:27,329 --> 00:40:34,473
-It doesn't necessarily need to be in one
remedy but what is necessary for you is

244
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:42,297
to evaluate which is the most disturbing
at the moment and give it more importance.

245
00:40:42,753 --> 00:40:47,560
And if you give more importance, underline
it, then most probably the remedy that

246
00:40:47,944 --> 00:40:50,232
has the symptoms will come up.

247
00:40:51,041 --> 00:41:01,354
Underlining means giving importance to this
because the patient is suffering a lot

248
00:41:01,697 --> 00:41:08,968
from that group of symptoms. There is
another group of symptoms still but not

249
00:41:09,297 --> 00:41:15,889
so severe. This would be
underlined once or twice.

250
00:41:17,369 --> 00:41:20,520
-This can be an
underneath layer as well.

251
00:41:20,993 --> 00:41:26,536
-Yes. It does not have to be covered
with one remedy both situations.

252
00:41:27,705 --> 00:41:34,617
One situation will go away and the other
situation will stay for the next layer.

253
00:41:36,361 --> 00:41:44,905
-When I see the opposite symptoms, I see
this in a patient having different layers,

254
00:41:45,345 --> 00:41:49,249
an uppermost and the underneath layer
coming half a year later maybe.

255
00:41:50,121 --> 00:41:57,104
But how can differentiate clearly when
there is somebody who is having this

256
00:41:57,448 --> 00:42:04,640
in one remedy... or if it is two layers
above this possibility or only one remedy

257
00:42:04,993 --> 00:42:06,689
and the other another
possibility.

258
00:42:07,105 --> 00:42:14,024
-I told you. There is a possibility that
both opposite situations are covered

259
00:42:14,376 --> 00:42:16,904
by one remedy. That
is one possibility.

260
00:42:17,305 --> 00:42:24,361
There is another one, the uppermost
layer is covered by Rhus tox and once

261
00:42:24,705 --> 00:42:29,385
Rhus tox is gone then
the other layer...

262
00:42:29,784 --> 00:42:33,784
or rather I'll give another
example which is more clear.

263
00:42:34,705 --> 00:42:44,161
You give Pulsatilla and it takes away the
aggravation from heat and in 6, 9 months

264
00:42:45,089 --> 00:42:52,264
there comes a set of symptoms
which need Silica. Freezing cold.

265
00:42:54,105 --> 00:42:59,881
So Silica will take care
of the underlying layer.

266
00:43:00,849 --> 00:43:08,568
Sometimes the patient may say under
certain circumstances I feel bad

267
00:43:09,065 --> 00:43:16,106
when there is a draft but still you
decide Pulsatilla is the uppermost.

268
00:43:16,585 --> 00:43:22,065
Give Pulsatilla, then it goes away. Then
it comes the draft and the coldness

269
00:43:22,449 --> 00:43:33,409
underneath, give Silica... Thank you.
You said the answer.

270
00:43:51,449 --> 00:44:04,353
-I speak Russian. We discuss the
theory of psora by Hahnemann

271
00:44:08,961 --> 00:44:13,425
and I wanted to ask a question
about the treatment of scabies.

272
00:44:16,576 --> 00:44:23,720
I had several patients that were
treated by me homeopathically

273
00:44:28,297 --> 00:44:33,152
it was a very long and tormenting
process for the patients.

274
00:44:35,336 --> 00:44:41,288
But yet afterwards they got better.
They were cured.

275
00:44:41,649 --> 00:44:43,073
-For how long did it last?

276
00:44:45,881 --> 00:44:56,113
-It lasted for several months. After
the potency 50M they got cured.

277
00:45:08,216 --> 00:45:11,624
But recently I read
an article by Burnett

278
00:45:17,761 --> 00:45:23,185
that was called the retake of
psora theory by Hahnemann.

279
00:45:31,849 --> 00:45:40,443
He writes there that it's absolutely
tormenting treating patients by this dynamical treatment

280
00:45:47,706 --> 00:45:58,009
that the patient skin should
be allowed to be treated externally

281
00:45:58,369 --> 00:46:01,569
by some ointments creams...

282
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:13,056
What do you think about this?

283
00:46:16,993 --> 00:46:45,409
-Scabies is infecting but it infects quite
healthy individuals. Usually children.

284
00:46:46,104 --> 00:46:56,561
Children which have good constitutions
are infected by scabies.

285
00:46:57,713 --> 00:47:10,385
Because scabies is a local infective
agent, it does not give general symptoms

286
00:47:10,737 --> 00:47:15,528
as reaction of the organism and it's
very difficult to find the remedy.

287
00:47:17,105 --> 00:47:32,209
In the meantime the problem is first the
suffering is tremendous because the itch

288
00:47:32,657 --> 00:47:43,169
is great. The second problem is that the
whole family is in danger of getting it

289
00:47:43,576 --> 00:47:54,048
as well, so you have to fight with time
and you have to find quickly the remedy

290
00:47:54,520 --> 00:48:03,264
and cure it. If you don't find it, you may
try for 2-5 months, then the whole family

291
00:48:03,673 --> 00:48:10,553
is infected by scabies. And scabies
have eaten up different places.

292
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:21,329
That's why because we cannot find the
remedy, we have to rely on the disinfectant

293
00:48:22,009 --> 00:48:44,048
because there is an effective cream
for scabies which can kill the acari.

294
00:48:47,056 --> 00:48:57,881
I don't know how much this kind of
treatment can affect the body in general.

295
00:48:58,177 --> 00:49:04,520
I believe it is going to affect it.
To what extent I am not able to say.

296
00:49:05,128 --> 00:49:11,248
Because again the same problem with
contemporary people, they cannot be

297
00:49:11,545 --> 00:49:18,793
infected by acaris. Not healthy
enough to be infected by acaris.

298
00:49:23,392 --> 00:49:30,896
But definitely once you are affected, a child
which is affected and by the old times

299
00:49:31,209 --> 00:49:42,817
they had quite strong treatment for that,
it was 60 years ago they had a strong

300
00:49:43,208 --> 00:49:50,016
ointment that they used to use
and suppressed the scabies.

301
00:49:52,409 --> 00:50:01,977
Then it would produce
the psoric miasm.

302
00:50:04,369 --> 00:50:13,497
Burnett most probably had the same
problem as I have when I meet such cases

303
00:50:14,456 --> 00:50:21,136
that unless you find the remedy quickly
the people will not tolerate it.

304
00:50:21,489 --> 00:50:24,777
They will go and get the remedy.

305
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:45,272
-Concerning this question, I am thinking
about what kind of damage is done

306
00:50:45,624 --> 00:50:52,745
with killing the bacteria. Because
logically when we have infected skin and

307
00:50:53,264 --> 00:50:58,384
we apply something some ointment
which will kill the bacteria,

308
00:50:59,129 --> 00:51:04,929
there must be some kind of inflammatory
process which is now unknown to us

309
00:51:05,568 --> 00:51:10,056
which will lead to the secondary
psoric manifestation.

310
00:51:12,937 --> 00:51:14,729
-I don't understand
the question.

311
00:51:16,873 --> 00:51:25,992
-What is the mechanism of secondary
manifestation when the primary infection

312
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:32,232
is suppressed?

313
00:51:34,449 --> 00:51:43,112
-I don't know the internal mechanism.
It's so complicated.

314
00:51:47,065 --> 00:51:53,024
It's within the sphere of the infinite,
the processes inside the body

315
00:51:53,689 --> 00:51:55,936
which are taking place.

316
00:51:56,410 --> 00:52:05,073
What I know also is that when
you are treating i.e. ringworm...

317
00:52:06,937 --> 00:52:31,057
Who knows ringworm? Ringworm is an
acari also which starts with a pimple

318
00:52:31,904 --> 00:52:45,201
and then this pimple expands in a circle
and the itch is great and it expands...

319
00:52:48,032 --> 00:52:53,112
If you do not treat it homeopathically
and you treat it allopathically

320
00:52:53,712 --> 00:53:04,489
you are definitely going to have the
manifestation of psora, that means a kind of

321
00:53:04,769 --> 00:53:09,664
a chronic condition which
will be quite severe.

322
00:53:11,584 --> 00:53:21,041
I have seen that again and again.
But the mechanism, I do not know.

323
00:53:31,464 --> 00:53:38,464
-3 things. The first is one
thing I will share with you.

324
00:53:38,833 --> 00:53:45,560
There is an Italian doctor who made
studies about the terms used by Hahnemann

325
00:53:46,008 --> 00:53:53,768
like scabies or [Italian word] or lepra and
what he found is that scabies was used

326
00:53:54,409 --> 00:53:57,529
as synonymous of itching.

327
00:53:58,488 --> 00:54:23,008
So in this way of view the acute of psora
is the manifestation of small vesicle with

328
00:54:23,464 --> 00:54:24,764
pus and itch...

329
00:54:44,216 --> 00:54:50,040
But in this way of view the scabies
was not the clinical problem

330
00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:56,255
but it was synonymous
to itching.

331
00:54:56,767 --> 00:55:04,558
So the origin of psora was psoriasis, not
scabies for this Italian doctor because

332
00:55:04,879 --> 00:55:08,679
he made etymological studies.

333
00:55:13,023 --> 00:55:22,022
Doctor Angelo Micozzi. If you want
I can write all his explanation.

334
00:55:22,495 --> 00:55:24,839
-He's an unknown fellow.

335
00:55:26,063 --> 00:55:28,279
-In Italy he is not.

336
00:55:30,975 --> 00:55:34,942
-I don't agree. I think
it is totally wrong.

337
00:55:39,271 --> 00:55:49,976
I am not sure psoriasis is a pure a psoric
miasm. It's more syphilitic and psoric

338
00:55:50,391 --> 00:56:00,519
at the same time. Scabies is...
at least what Hahnemann means...

339
00:56:01,727 --> 00:56:13,719
because the scabies were manifesting in
very old times. Psoriasis I don't know.

340
00:56:14,383 --> 00:56:22,863
You are entering the internet and tell
me when psoriasis was first diagnosed.

341
00:56:23,535 --> 00:56:34,575
-Because in his study he found that lepra
was used as a synonymous of psoriasis.

342
00:56:35,615 --> 00:56:37,335
-Of psoriasis?!

343
00:56:49,607 --> 00:56:55,431
-That's what he found. We know lepra but
there was also called lepra vulgaris

344
00:56:56,343 --> 00:57:06,883
which was in reality psoriasis. There
was lepra as we know it and

345
00:57:07,308 --> 00:57:12,323
there was also lepra vulgaris
which was the psoriasis.

346
00:57:10,973 --> 00:57:22,133
-First time I hear such a theory with
which I do not agree initially but...

347
00:57:26,181 --> 00:57:32,020
-And I came here to Alonissos with
two questions about the Organon.

348
00:57:33,876 --> 00:57:39,292
If you think there is a way to
translate the word "vital force"

349
00:57:40,205 --> 00:57:44,085
into a modern language.
-What do you propose?

350
00:57:45,541 --> 00:57:53,708
-It's really difficult because there is a
scientific theory about complex systems...

351
00:57:55,500 --> 00:58:07,148
What I propose is that vital force are
all the rules that govern our organism...

352
00:58:24,268 --> 00:58:26,588
But I don't know...

353
00:58:29,444 --> 00:58:38,692
-In my understanding the vital force is a
neutral energy that permeates everyone

354
00:58:41,541 --> 00:58:49,540
and because it comes through our
bodies, we shape it and we use it.

355
00:58:53,213 --> 00:58:58,189
It's a neutral energy that comes
through us, animates the body,

356
00:58:59,228 --> 00:59:08,797
we shape it through our actions
and we transform it from neutral

357
00:59:09,557 --> 00:59:15,901
to something else which may be...

358
00:59:20,788 --> 00:59:25,892
-Vital force interacts
with our organism...

359
00:59:26,469 --> 00:59:36,629
-We say it is bioenergy. It's another term
that you can be using but the main thing

360
00:59:37,036 --> 00:59:42,676
is to understand what it is all about.
All this is theoretical unless you have

361
00:59:43,029 --> 00:59:46,717
the experience and which
is the experience?

362
00:59:47,541 --> 00:59:53,972
The experience is to have seen a whole
formation of energy coming out of

363
00:59:54,308 --> 01:00:07,341
the person who is dying. We may develop
sensitive lenses and the moment of death,

364
01:00:07,845 --> 01:00:16,965
that the body separates from the energy, we
can film this exodus, this externalization.

365
01:00:17,965 --> 01:00:26,780
And then people will say yes we knew all
that. But before we find the correct lenses

366
01:00:27,348 --> 01:00:32,740
to film this, people may have
different ideas about it.

367
01:00:34,829 --> 01:00:40,389
-And the last question. What do you
think about the note in paragraph 31

368
01:00:41,389 --> 01:00:48,124
where Hahnemann speaks about what he
thinks about the dynamics of diseases

369
01:00:48,572 --> 01:00:51,924
and he used the word
"metaphysical".

370
01:00:59,037 --> 01:01:06,116
-Par. 31 Ok. I will
read it for your sake.

371
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:20,708
"The inimical forces, partly psychical,
partly physical, to which our terrestrial

372
01:01:21,036 --> 01:01:29,956
existence is exposed, which are
termed morbific noxious agents,

373
01:01:30,997 --> 01:01:41,285
do not possess the power of morbidly
deranging the health of man unconditionally;

374
01:01:42,916 --> 01:01:52,749
but we are made ill by them only when our
organism is sufficiently disposed and

375
01:01:53,093 --> 01:01:59,388
susceptible to the attack of the
morbific cause that may be present,

376
01:02:01,173 --> 01:02:12,244
and to be altered in its health, deranged
and made to undergo abnormal sensations

377
01:02:12,628 --> 01:02:20,004
and functions - hence they do not produce
disease in every one nor at all times."

378
01:02:21,973 --> 01:02:26,069
If you want me to explain
this, I can tell you this.

379
01:02:27,605 --> 01:02:37,701
He says the inimical forces, whether
they are material or psychical,

380
01:02:40,749 --> 01:02:53,445
that means the natural causes of
disease, do not have an unlimited power

381
01:02:53,884 --> 01:02:55,428
over the organism.

382
01:02:55,853 --> 01:03:02,749
That means once a disease comes, it does
not mean that all of us will be sick.

383
01:03:04,108 --> 01:03:14,429
But it will depend on our structure
whether we will accept to be sick or not

384
01:03:17,069 --> 01:03:30,923
and he wants to bring this in
contradistinction with the drugs which have

385
01:03:31,195 --> 01:03:34,891
an unlimited action
upon the organism.

386
01:03:35,587 --> 01:03:43,146
That means any drug, if you take in large
enough doses, will produce some effect

387
01:03:43,834 --> 01:03:49,194
on the organism. But the natural
disease does not have this power.

388
01:03:49,907 --> 01:03:54,163
You have to have a predisposition
in order to be infected.

389
01:03:55,291 --> 01:04:00,466
-Do you think that this is the reason
that antibiotics are suppressive?

390
01:04:01,034 --> 01:04:02,101
-Exactly.

391
01:04:23,097 --> 01:04:36,089
Who wants to speak? The time
is in a meditative mood.

392
01:04:50,545 --> 01:04:54,377
-I want your opinion
about a case that I had.

393
01:04:55,457 --> 01:05:14,161
I had a young woman who was divorced,
was around 45, who has adopted a child

394
01:05:15,424 --> 01:05:24,401
in spite of the different opinion of her
boyfriend and she visited me because

395
01:05:24,761 --> 01:05:39,625
she has a great loss of weight. She
has lost over 20 kilos in 2 years.

396
01:05:41,369 --> 01:05:46,705
She was depressed because she was
pressed by her mother to divorce him,

397
01:05:48,713 --> 01:05:58,121
her boyfriend didn't want to adopt the
child and be the father and I thought

398
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:01,783
that something bad has happened
to her because of her pallor.

399
01:06:03,031 --> 01:06:11,207
-Stop here. I want you to tell me what you
understand the pathology of this woman

400
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:20,713
may be from the
description so far.

401
01:06:22,223 --> 01:06:29,911
What can be the pathology of a woman
aged 45 who is having a conflict with

402
01:06:30,264 --> 01:06:38,610
her boyfriend and also emotional problem
with the mother who is pressurizing her

403
01:06:39,010 --> 01:06:44,986
to divorce this man and the man does not
want to adopt the child and the woman

404
01:06:45,306 --> 01:06:48,721
has found herself
in that conflict.

405
01:06:49,217 --> 01:06:59,370
What is the organ that most probably
will break down and will not function?

406
01:07:02,730 --> 01:07:16,290
Correct, the thyroid. Most probably
the problem is the thyroid.

407
01:07:17,642 --> 01:07:23,569
-I suspected that beyond the emotional
pathology something was deeper.

408
01:07:24,121 --> 01:07:30,089
Because I thought of anorexia nervosa.
I suggested a psychiatrist examination

409
01:07:30,465 --> 01:07:33,753
and an examination
from an internist.

410
01:07:40,089 --> 01:07:44,577
The psychiatrist confirmed my suspicion
that beyond emotional pathology

411
01:07:44,945 --> 01:07:54,730
there was something deeper. The
pathology wasn't only emotional.

412
01:07:59,561 --> 01:08:09,402
The internist who examined her suggested
further laboratory examination.

413
01:08:10,106 --> 01:08:23,074
This was normal. I suspected
that something wasn't real.

414
01:08:23,738 --> 01:08:29,162
After some months a pediatrician
called me and told me that this woman

415
01:08:29,546 --> 01:08:34,633
was dying of cancer. The diagnosis
of cancer was 3 years ago.

416
01:08:35,369 --> 01:08:42,537
That means that she lied to 3 scientists
and when she had adopted the child

417
01:08:43,186 --> 01:08:48,826
she had the diagnosis of cancer and I
cannot understand why this woman lied

418
01:08:49,570 --> 01:08:58,497
to 3 doctors... She knew that and she
didn't tell me or the other 2 doctors.

419
01:09:00,354 --> 01:09:02,250
And she wanted me to help her.

420
01:09:02,610 --> 01:09:04,066
-Where was the cancer?

421
01:09:04,938 --> 01:09:10,233
-The cancer was in breast and she
had metastases all over the body.

422
01:09:13,481 --> 01:09:15,865
-So she knew her diagnosis.

423
01:09:16,530 --> 01:09:21,034
-But she didn't tell me, nor to the
psychiatrist, nor to the internist.

424
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:29,297
And now the child is under the care
of the grandparents who are 80 and

425
01:09:29,649 --> 01:09:34,881
72 years old. That means that the
child is the victim of all this.

426
01:09:36,898 --> 01:09:44,161
The father went away. Why did this
woman tell lies to 3 doctors?

427
01:09:50,754 --> 01:09:52,330
-It's very simple.

428
01:10:10,770 --> 01:10:18,217
She wanted most probably to have the
child and if she said I have cancer

429
01:10:18,577 --> 01:10:30,122
nobody would give her the child. No
organization will give a child to a woman

430
01:10:30,506 --> 01:10:35,530
that is known to have cancer.
She may die after a few years.

431
01:10:45,962 --> 01:10:56,034
But if she did not have cancer I would expect
that the conflict will be on this area,

432
01:10:56,434 --> 01:11:03,401
which is the area affected by emotions.
Helen was correct.

433
01:11:19,514 --> 01:11:34,906
Next? You still have 35 seconds for
a question. Greeks are active.

434
01:11:36,970 --> 01:11:44,106
-Suppose that a person has some
symptoms that are covered by a remedy

435
01:11:44,386 --> 01:11:46,577
that has not been
discovered yet.

436
01:11:51,361 --> 01:11:56,833
So he goes to the homeopath and
he gives a close remedy and then

437
01:11:57,490 --> 01:12:00,138
another remedy which
is again close...

438
01:12:00,490 --> 01:12:04,833
-If he is a good homeopath
slowly he may bring about...

439
01:12:05,113 --> 01:12:08,713
-That's what I wanted to ask. Is there a
possibility for this person to be cured?

440
01:12:09,393 --> 01:12:11,929
-Yes, but it will
take much longer.

441
01:12:14,114 --> 01:12:16,746
-Even if the totality
is not there.

442
01:12:17,418 --> 01:12:20,545
-Yes, I believe. But it
will take much longer.
