1
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:54,751
Paragraph 65, It's the after effect and the curative effect. This is understood.

2
00:00:54,951 --> 00:01:00,017
Primary effect, secondary effect... The primary accepts,

3
00:01:00,217 --> 00:01:07,499
the secondary is the reaction of the vital force and these are the symptoms

4
00:01:07,699 --> 00:01:13,547
which are developing during the reaction of the vital force.

5
00:01:13,747 --> 00:01:19,420
But for a proving we do not separate primary and secondary.

6
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:29,329
We take down everything and this constitutes the picture of the remedy.

7
00:01:29,529 --> 00:01:36,054
"Examples of the first instance referred to are familiar to everybody.

8
00:01:36,254 --> 00:01:47,011
A hand bathed in hot water is at first much warmer..." He gives an example.

9
00:01:47,211 --> 00:01:54,529
You put your hand, first you burn, then it becomes red, then the secondary effect

10
00:01:54,729 --> 00:02:02,173
is to become white. If you put your hand in hot water.

11
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:14,731
"A person heated by violent bodily exercise (primary effect) afterwards feels

12
00:02:14,931 --> 00:02:24,403
chills and rigors (secondary effect). To one who was yesterday heated by drinking

13
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:36,277
much wine (primary effect), today every breath of air feels too cold (counter effect

14
00:02:36,477 --> 00:02:40,305
of the organism, secondary effect)."

15
00:02:46,037 --> 00:02:58,568
And he goes on giving examples of primary and secondary reactions of the organism.

16
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:22,980
"A conspicuous opposite or after effect is imperceptible during the action of very

17
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:30,060
minute homeopathic doses of alternative potencies in a healthy body although

18
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:36,302
minute doses when closely observed may be seen to produce a perceptible

19
00:03:36,502 --> 00:03:44,799
primary effect the living organism sets up only so much counter effect as is required

20
00:03:44,999 --> 00:03:51,615
for the reestablishment of the normal condition."

21
00:03:51,815 --> 00:04:00,154
Because if you give a potency there is no material substance so the primary effect

22
00:04:00,354 --> 00:04:09,139
is not perceptible. What is perceptible? It's only the secondary effect.

23
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:18,931
So when you take a homeopathic remedy, for instance you want to do a proving

24
00:04:19,131 --> 00:04:28,105
and you take a dose of 200CH or 30CH. You will feel nothing.

25
00:04:28,305 --> 00:04:40,460
But if you are sensitive to this, after a few hours, days, you may have

26
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,724
some symptoms of the proving.

27
00:04:44,924 --> 00:04:51,430
But the primary effect is not there because of the minuteness of the dose.

28
00:04:57,905 --> 00:05:05,696
-So we prescribe on both primary effect and secondary effect, right?

29
00:05:05,896 --> 00:05:11,797
-All material drugs have primary and secondary effect.

30
00:05:11,997 --> 00:05:19,821
The high potencies can have secondary effects in a proving.

31
00:05:20,021 --> 00:05:24,985
-But say if it's a virus infection and the virus had an effect, we take both.

32
00:05:25,185 --> 00:05:31,853
Whatever virus did and whatever body responding to the virus, right?

33
00:05:32,053 --> 00:05:39,029
Or say a person was bitten by a snake, the snake venom affected the body

34
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:42,138
very strongly...

35
00:05:42,338 --> 00:05:53,754
-The primary effect is the pain. The secondary is when the blood is poisoned and

36
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:57,341
then becomes swollen.

37
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:08,184
-Why is it not a primary effect of the venom of the permeability of the blood vessel?

38
00:06:09,739 --> 00:06:18,111
-He calls it primary and secondary because he has noticed that in certain drugs,

39
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:27,674
if you take a drug, the primary effect could be this, the secondary effect could be

40
00:06:27,874 --> 00:06:31,129
the opposite.

41
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:34,043
-We prescribe on both, right?

42
00:06:34,243 --> 00:06:41,097
-We prescribe on both because we have the picture of the proving from primary and

43
00:06:41,297 --> 00:06:45,126
secondary effects.

44
00:06:45,326 --> 00:06:50,828
The MM is consisted of primary and secondary effects.

45
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:56,435
But do not pay too much attention to this, it is not important.

46
00:06:56,635 --> 00:07:01,729
It doesn't differentiate anything in the prescription of a remedy.

47
00:07:01,929 --> 00:07:14,935
Hahnemann is very precise and he wants to put everything into order and

48
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:20,297
that is why he says all that.

49
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:31,508
"These incontrovertible truths, which spontaneously offer themselves to our notice

50
00:07:35,258 --> 00:07:38,162
and experience, explain to us the beneficial action that takes place under

51
00:07:39,162 --> 00:07:45,281
homoeopathic treatment; while, on the other hand, they demonstrate the perversity

52
00:07:46,311 --> 00:07:50,678
of the antipathic and palliative treatment of diseases with antagonistically

53
00:07:53,883 --> 00:07:53,314
acting medicines."

54
00:07:55,586 --> 00:07:58,693
He continues to hammer the idea don't give palliative remedies.

55
00:07:59,596 --> 00:08:07,778
Try to give a remedy that covers the totality of the symptoms.

56
00:08:08,941 --> 00:08:15,796
"We learn from homeopathic cures that after the extinction of the natural disease

57
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:24,681
there is up to linger in the system a remnant of the drug disease and gendered by

58
00:08:24,881 --> 00:08:32,942
the minute doses of medicine required by this method of cure and which were

59
00:08:33,142 --> 00:08:41,050
just sufficient to overcome and to supersede dissimilar natural disease

60
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,666
by the similitude of their symptoms."

61
00:08:44,866 --> 00:08:58,474
What it means here? According to his experiments and his ideas,

62
00:08:58,674 --> 00:09:09,708
his method of prescribing by this time he was prescribing low potencies.

63
00:09:12,764 --> 00:09:20,981
Sometimes the low potency due to the sensitivity that the remedy has to

64
00:09:21,181 --> 00:09:35,118
the organism will leave some effects of its own on the patient.

65
00:09:35,318 --> 00:09:40,109
He will call this aggravation later on.

66
00:09:40,309 --> 00:09:46,211
"But we also learn that this remnant of drug disease is very transient"

67
00:09:46,411 --> 00:09:52,704
but what is left over as a result of the remedy given is going away.

68
00:09:52,904 --> 00:10:00,397
"and vanishes easily and quickly on account of the extreme minuteness of the dose"

69
00:10:00,597 --> 00:10:09,110
because the dose is very little this effect is going away.

70
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:18,124
"This prevents the vital force from being aroused to a greater degree of

71
00:10:18,324 --> 00:10:26,585
counteraction against this slight artificial effect that is required for the restoration

72
00:10:26,785 --> 00:10:31,554
of feeling to the standard of health."

73
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,850
This prevents the vital force from being aroused...

74
00:10:41,053 --> 00:10:46,208
He says the vital force because of the minuteness of the dose is not interested

75
00:10:46,408 --> 00:10:49,977
to be aroused and counteract the effect.

76
00:10:50,177 --> 00:10:56,572
That's why the effect will stay for a while and then it will go away by itself.

77
00:10:56,772 --> 00:11:01,339
This is what he means here.

78
00:11:01,539 --> 00:11:07,962
"That is for the purpose of complete recovery the vital force needs to make but

79
00:11:08,162 --> 00:11:13,957
a slight additional exertion to overcome the effects of the medicine

80
00:11:15,988 --> 00:11:21,963
after the extinction of the disease."

81
00:11:27,485 --> 00:11:38,830
Still underneath is his idea that he has given a similar but stronger disease and

82
00:11:39,134 --> 00:11:53,025
his idea is that once this is stronger, it's going to leave some effect on the organism.

83
00:11:53,225 --> 00:12:01,883
And this little effect because of the minuteness of the dose will be transient

84
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:11,727
and the vital force has to do very little effort to get rid of what is left over from

85
00:12:11,927 --> 00:12:26,945
the remedy that was prescribed. Has anybody understood? Genius?

86
00:12:42,063 --> 00:12:49,080
"In the antipathic (palliative) mode of treatment, however precisely the reverse

87
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:57,172
of this takes place. The medicinal symptom which the physician opposes to

88
00:12:57,372 --> 00:13:02,782
the disease symptom (for example, the insensibility and stupefaction caused

89
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:06,883
by opium in its primary action to acute pain) is certainly not alien, not allopathic

90
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:12,810
of the latter."

91
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:19,332
He speaks with his own experience by that time.

92
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:31,378
What was the main painkiller they had at their disposal? Opium.

93
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:40,555
So he had noticed the effect of it. The primary effect of it is to make the person

94
00:13:40,755 --> 00:13:50,005
stupid, so he does not understand anything, not even the pain.

95
00:13:50,205 --> 00:14:00,313
On account of this the patient does not feel the pain but he says later on the pain

96
00:14:00,513 --> 00:14:11,692
will come in a greater force. Therefore Opium has not actually cured the pain.

97
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:20,687
It suppressed the pain and in the effect of the Opium, the organism will make

98
00:14:20,887 --> 00:14:24,835
a big effort to get rid of the Opium effect.

99
00:14:25,035 --> 00:14:32,398
He compares the 2 systems. One we give very minute dose and if something

100
00:14:32,598 --> 00:14:42,287
is left over because of the dose, the organism makes a small effort and gets rid of it.

101
00:14:42,487 --> 00:14:53,461
If you prescribe with the idea of opposites, you will give Opium, you suppress

102
00:14:53,661 --> 00:14:59,767
the pain, you suppress the whole organism actually, the organism does not feel

103
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:11,122
the pain but later on the effect is gone, the organism gets rid of the effect of Opium

104
00:15:11,322 --> 00:15:16,357
and the final effect is the relapse of the pain.

105
00:15:22,892 --> 00:15:29,850
The Organon is a book that was written during that time where all this kind of

106
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:39,044
treatment was used and he had to write in a German way which needs details

107
00:15:39,244 --> 00:15:48,117
to be persuaded and he writes mostly these details for his colleagues who were

108
00:15:48,317 --> 00:15:52,269
going to criticize what he was doing.

109
00:15:52,469 --> 00:15:57,945
And that's why he goes so meticulously.

110
00:15:58,145 --> 00:16:07,822
The important points in the Organon are few.

111
00:16:08,022 --> 00:16:17,490
But in any case whatever he says is absolutely true, even he had no idea of what

112
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:24,841
was coming later on as chemical drugs.

113
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:32,324
He gives all the background of what happens today when people are taking

114
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:42,434
chemical drugs. His observations were the observations of a genius.

115
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:06,686
"The extinction of the disease symptom is in this case to be accomplished by an

116
00:17:06,886 --> 00:17:12,212
opposite drug symptom which is quite impossible.

117
00:17:12,412 --> 00:17:18,258
It is true that the antipathic medicine acts upon the same diseased region of the

118
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:25,231
body and with the same degree of certainty as the homeopathic medicine selected

119
00:17:25,431 --> 00:17:31,010
on account of its similar morbific effect but the formal being an opposite to the

120
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:40,470
symptom of the disease it only obscures the latter and render is imperceptible for

121
00:17:42,698 --> 00:17:46,206
a short time". Again the same idea.

122
00:17:46,406 --> 00:17:57,338
You give the opposite, you push the disease and then disease comes back.

123
00:17:57,538 --> 00:18:08,199
"The vital force perceives no disagreeable sensation neither from the symptom

124
00:18:08,399 --> 00:18:13,974
of the disease nor from that of the opposite drug during the first moment of the

125
00:18:14,174 --> 00:18:22,824
effect produced by the opponent palliative because both appear to have cancelled

126
00:18:23,024 --> 00:18:31,753
or to have dynamically neutralize each other the benumbing power of Opium seems

127
00:18:31,953 --> 00:18:38,261
to neutralize this pain."

128
00:18:38,461 --> 00:18:45,507
He just talks about the obvious thing and how Opium...

129
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:48,917
What he says actually is that Opium is not a curative agent.

130
00:18:49,117 --> 00:18:55,464
It's an agent which suppresses the disease for a while or the pain and benumbs the

131
00:18:55,664 --> 00:19:00,201
organism and then the pain comes back.

132
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:09,856
"During the first minutes of palliative effect, the vital force feels as if in health

133
00:19:10,056 --> 00:19:17,228
perceiving neither the benumbing effect of Opium nor the pain of the disease."

134
00:19:17,428 --> 00:19:30,792
For a while the patient feels he is quite good. This is what happens today...

135
00:19:30,992 --> 00:19:40,981
And how dangerous it is. What is an equivalent of what he says here

136
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:48,555
with what we know to happen in our modern societies.

137
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:53,018
What drugs?

138
00:19:53,218 --> 00:19:57,643
-Recreational.

139
00:19:57,843 --> 00:20:05,218
-Mostly heroine.

140
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:25,248
Those who take heroine they feel so well for a certain short period of time.

141
00:20:25,448 --> 00:20:34,332
They feel so good on the top of the world and then of course there is a relapse of

142
00:20:34,532 --> 00:20:42,505
their sadness, depression and bad feelings to the extent that they need another

143
00:20:42,705 --> 00:20:47,063
dose and another dose... until they die.

144
00:20:52,176 --> 00:20:59,787
It's not the same with antidepressants? This is a good question.

145
00:20:59,987 --> 00:21:11,507
What is the antidepressant? It's a drug which has been regulated in each dose

146
00:21:11,707 --> 00:21:23,283
to stimulate the brain in producing opiates, serotonin but in a controlled way.

147
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:33,610
If you give, from these antidepressant drugs, a huge dose, it will be like taking

148
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:40,775
heroine or like taking opium in big doses.

149
00:21:40,975 --> 00:21:46,438
But the difference with the drugs is the controlling of the dose.

150
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:53,876
That's why the psychiatrists who prescribe these drugs usually they say

151
00:21:54,076 --> 00:21:58,071
it is not going to act immediately.

152
00:21:58,271 --> 00:22:06,433
You need a few days before you can feel the effect.

153
00:22:06,633 --> 00:22:12,719
They say keep on taking it though there is no effect.

154
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:23,969
For 2-3 days the patient feels no change. Why? They want to raise the amount

155
00:22:24,169 --> 00:22:38,453
of opiates - morphine or whatever- derivatives of opium, most probably all of these..

156
00:22:38,653 --> 00:22:50,129
until the level is raised in the blood to such an extent as to create the desired effect.

157
00:22:50,329 --> 00:23:06,220
That means to substitute the normal flow of serotonin in a human being

158
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:14,359
who is in joy or in happiness.

159
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:30,493
I am not an expert in this but anyhow I have a general idea.

160
00:23:30,693 --> 00:23:42,887
What I know is this, students who want to excel in their examinations

161
00:23:43,087 --> 00:23:53,877
they used to take, I don't know if they do it today, but 50 years ago

162
00:23:54,077 --> 00:24:04,992
they used to take ephedrine and the mind became so lucid and all the information

163
00:24:05,192 --> 00:24:11,806
comes and they can write fantastic exams.

164
00:24:12,006 --> 00:24:18,850
As a result such persons they are damaged for life.

165
00:24:20,973 --> 00:24:28,848
They can become even psychotic eventually, they are not able to concentrate.

166
00:24:29,048 --> 00:24:35,721
They have what they call an attention deficit disorder.

167
00:24:38,705 --> 00:24:49,087
For these discoveries that neurophysiology has done the recent 30 years

168
00:24:49,287 --> 00:25:01,140
which are quite impressive how the brain functions and how you can interfere with

169
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:13,541
the brain. I remember perhaps 50 years ago they were doing experiments with

170
00:25:13,741 --> 00:25:22,731
electrodes where they connected them in the brain and they stimulated the brain

171
00:25:22,931 --> 00:25:27,890
to produce happiness.

172
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:36,562
That means they have found the place in the brain which is responsible

173
00:25:36,762 --> 00:25:46,682
for these feelings, I don't know exactly which place...

174
00:25:50,245 --> 00:25:56,249
but they have found, they put the electrodes and they stimulated and the people

175
00:25:56,449 --> 00:26:02,090
were in happiness.

176
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:12,269
If they did that for some period of time, the persons could be damaged for life.

177
00:26:19,512 --> 00:26:27,026
His observations are nothing else but what we know today to be the effect

178
00:26:27,226 --> 00:26:33,813
of heroine. Heroine is a derivative of opium.

179
00:26:51,029 --> 00:27:00,020
Can you repeat please? It's a derivative of opium.

180
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:05,251
-Heroine and morphine is a derivative of opium.

181
00:27:05,451 --> 00:27:13,052
-Can I ask you a question? Why so many teenagers commit suicide when they are

182
00:27:13,252 --> 00:27:21,952
put on those serotonin reuptake inhibitors... why are teenagers different from adults?

183
00:27:22,152 --> 00:27:30,006
More of them commit suicide then.

184
00:27:30,575 --> 00:27:34,663
-Teenagers who take what? Antidepressants.

185
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:37,641
-Why do you think?

186
00:27:39,302 --> 00:27:44,797
-I don't know. This is the first time I hear these statistics. I have to think about it.

187
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:55,418
But if it is true I don't know. But it is a well-known fact that if somebody is on a

188
00:27:55,618 --> 00:29:02,521
psychotherapy with such drugs [talking in Greek searching for the right word]

189
00:29:02,721 --> 00:29:06,823
...Ok, during the therapy with drugs.

190
00:29:07,023 --> 00:29:13,529
It is a well-known fact that for a certain period of time, when the person comes out

191
00:29:13,729 --> 00:29:22,652
of the depression, that is the time they commit suicide. This is an established fact.

192
00:29:22,852 --> 00:29:30,904
Now if you say why, it is very easy to get the answer.

193
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:40,277
The answer is the same as we say all along that a symptom is produced in order

194
00:29:40,477 --> 00:29:51,860
to save the life of the person. Any symptom, anxiety, depression is produced

195
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:58,400
in order to prevent a much worse situation.

196
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:05,692
It's the defense of the organism. So the organism says put this person

197
00:30:05,892 --> 00:30:12,159
in depression, otherwise he will commit suicide.

198
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:17,078
Now you come in an artificial way and you take out the depression.

199
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:24,931
You bring the person face to face with the problem that brought him

200
00:30:25,131 --> 00:30:33,979
to the depression. If the problem had not been resolved and they suddenly face

201
00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:41,005
again the problem in reality, they cannot stand it and commit suicide.

202
00:30:41,205 --> 00:30:48,913
That's the explanation. Is it clear?

203
00:30:53,988 --> 00:31:07,780
-I have a question for the ephedrine you said. You said 50 years ago students

204
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:21,514
took ephedrine for being better in the exams and you said they destroyed...

205
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:31,459
-They destroyed part of the brain. This is a general rule. I want you to understand.

206
00:31:31,659 --> 00:31:42,124
You stimulate a portion of the brain, if you stimulate it too much,

207
00:31:42,324 --> 00:31:53,763
you make it work that point, you force it to work but in the end it may be

208
00:31:53,963 --> 00:32:01,403
destroyed totally. It's like a machine overworking full speed and you burn it.

209
00:32:01,603 --> 00:32:11,537
So you burn the area of the brain which you force through a chemical to overwork.

210
00:32:11,737 --> 00:32:20,356
-My question is that is there any chance by homeopathy to recover?

211
00:32:20,556 --> 00:32:25,436
-It's very difficult.

212
00:32:25,636 --> 00:32:29,165
-Because on the other side there are so many students I know they take Ritalin

213
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:36,206
or cocaine and things like these to pass the examination and a lot of them have

214
00:32:36,406 --> 00:32:42,494
been using marijuana where they were pupils in younger age, so they have a lot

215
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:49,222
of problems to concentrate and they sit there and they get mixed up totally.

216
00:32:49,422 --> 00:32:57,170
So now in Germany I know from a lot of my patients and my sons they take Ritalin,

217
00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:01,214
you know Retalin?

218
00:33:01,414 --> 00:33:09,352
-I know. I also know that in Germany they force the children if they are restless

219
00:33:09,552 --> 00:33:14,848
to take Ritalin.

220
00:33:15,048 --> 00:33:21,368
-I am just talking about those students later on they really take Ritalin for

221
00:33:21,568 --> 00:33:27,075
better result for their studies. So what happens to those people?

222
00:33:27,275 --> 00:33:32,529
-I'll tell you. The difference is again the regulation of the dose.

223
00:33:32,729 --> 00:33:39,979
That means they regulate in such a way they will not burn out the area of the brain

224
00:33:40,179 --> 00:33:53,467
towards which these chemicals are acting. If they overdo it they will burn it.

225
00:33:53,667 --> 00:34:03,897
Whether a ADD child will take Ritalin for 2-3 years regulated in doses

226
00:34:04,097 --> 00:34:12,786
and then continue without it, it's possible to be treated and cured.

227
00:34:12,986 --> 00:34:25,078
But if they burn out a child through excessive doses, it's very difficult to recover.

228
00:34:44,028 --> 00:34:50,681
No more questions.

229
00:34:50,881 --> 00:35:00,697
Paragraph 70, "After these premises, the following points must be admitted

230
00:35:00,897 --> 00:35:05,540
as true: 1st. All that a physician may regard as curable in diseases,

231
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:10,390
consists entirely in the complaints of the patient, and the morbid changes of

232
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:17,129
his health perceptible to the senses; that is to say, it consists entirely

233
00:35:17,329 --> 00:35:24,824
in the totality of symptoms through which the disease expresses its demand

234
00:35:25,024 --> 00:35:32,037
for the appropriate remedy; while, on the other hand, every fictitious

235
00:35:32,237 --> 00:35:39,026
or obscure, internal cause and condition, or imaginary, material, morbific matter

236
00:35:39,226 --> 00:35:44,103
are not objects of treatment."

237
00:35:47,368 --> 00:35:55,038
The only things that you have to treat are the symptoms

238
00:35:55,238 --> 00:36:04,948
and there are no behind the symptoms a disease which you must treat.

239
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:17,550
In reality what he says is that a disease manifests only through symptoms

240
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:28,845
and the senses perceive these symptoms and the totality of these symptoms

241
00:36:29,045 --> 00:36:38,379
are your guidelines on which you will prescribe the right remedy.

242
00:36:45,468 --> 00:36:52,037
"2nd.This change of health (discord of feeling) which we call disease, can only

243
00:36:52,237 --> 00:37:00,339
be changed back to the normal state by means of medicines, the curative power

244
00:37:00,539 --> 00:37:09,248
of which, consequently, consists in their ability to alter the state of feelings; i.e.,

245
00:37:09,448 --> 00:37:14,129
in the production of peculiar, morbid symptoms, recognized most distinctly

246
00:37:14,329 --> 00:37:21,473
and purely by testing these medicines upon the bodies of healthy persons."

247
00:37:21,673 --> 00:37:31,428
So this change in the health which we call disease can only be cured

248
00:37:31,628 --> 00:37:40,310
through remedies which have produced in the healthy person similar symptoms.

249
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:46,782
"3rd. According to experience, natural disease cannot be cured by medicines

250
00:37:46,982 --> 00:38:02,243
producing by themselves, in healthy persons, a morbid condition dissimilar to

251
00:38:02,443 --> 00:38:08,596
and different from that of the disease to be cured. It is, therefore, incurable by

252
00:38:08,796 --> 00:38:10,612
allopathic treatment,

253
00:38:10,812 --> 00:38:17,202
and even nature herself never cures natural disease by super-adding another disease,

254
00:38:17,402 --> 00:38:25,444
dissimilar to, though of much greater intensity than the first."

255
00:38:25,644 --> 00:38:39,741
So the only way to cure is by medicines which are producing similar effect.

256
00:38:39,941 --> 00:38:48,077
If they are dissimilar, then they cannot cure.

257
00:38:48,277 --> 00:38:53,502
"4th. Experience also teaches that only transient relief is procured by medicines

258
00:38:53,702 --> 00:39:00,552
inclined to generate in a healthy person, an artificial symptom which is the exact

259
00:39:00,752 --> 00:39:06,181
opposite of certain symptoms, peculiar to the natural disease to be cured.

260
00:39:06,381 --> 00:39:12,341
And we also learn that such medicines can never cure an inveterate disease, without

261
00:39:12,541 --> 00:39:17,300
always creating a subsequent aggravation of the same.

262
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:22,578
On this account this antipathic, palliative process is entirely inappropriate

263
00:39:22,778 --> 00:39:30,976
in its application to chronic and serious diseases."

264
00:39:31,176 --> 00:39:40,311
What he says is that first of all why the organism cannot cure by itself

265
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:43,643
a chronic disease?

266
00:39:43,843 --> 00:39:52,492
Because he does not have the possibility to produce a similar disease as he calls it

267
00:39:52,692 --> 00:40:00,148
to produce a medicine by itself to cure itself.

268
00:40:00,348 --> 00:40:12,596
Therefore there is always the effort of the organism through the fits of the crisis

269
00:40:12,796 --> 00:40:25,395
in chronic diseases, there is an extra effort of the organism to cure itself.

270
00:40:25,595 --> 00:40:35,115
Also if you give an antipathic remedy, you are not going to cure.

271
00:40:35,315 --> 00:40:44,079
So he will drive to the conclusion that the only method of cure is the homeopathic.

272
00:40:47,527 --> 00:40:53,377
"Experience also teaches that only transient relief is procured by medicines inclined

273
00:40:53,577 --> 00:41:05,751
to generate in a healthy person, an artificial symptom which is the exact opposite

274
00:41:05,951 --> 00:41:08,230
of certain symptoms..."

275
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:12,143
"5th. The only really salutary treatment is that of the homoeopathic method,

276
00:41:12,343 --> 00:41:19,310
according to which the totality of symptoms of a natural disease is combated by

277
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:28,686
a medicine in commensurate dose, capable of creating in the healthy body,

278
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:35,094
symptoms most similar to those of the natural disease."

279
00:41:35,294 --> 00:41:44,026
So he tells all the previous ones not this, not that, chronic diseases cannot be cured

280
00:41:44,226 --> 00:41:50,688
and the only way to cure is with homeopathic treatment, with drugs which have

281
00:41:50,888 --> 00:41:55,182
produced similar symptoms to the disease.

282
00:41:55,382 --> 00:42:00,528
"And as diseases are only dynamic disturbances of the vital force, they are

283
00:42:00,728 --> 00:42:07,836
overcome without additional suffering, and having been perfectly and

284
00:42:08,036 --> 00:42:11,065
permanently extinguished, they must cease to exist.

285
00:42:11,265 --> 00:42:16,389
Nature when left to her own resources, furnishes examples in the form of

286
00:42:16,589 --> 00:42:21,387
accidental cures; as, for instance, when a new and similar disease is added to

287
00:42:21,587 --> 00:42:26,873
the older one, this is permanently extinguished and cured."

288
00:42:27,073 --> 00:42:40,891
He brings again the idea of Nature curing by the similar. This is not the only way.

289
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:49,311
What we know today is that automatic cure can happen in an organism

290
00:42:49,511 --> 00:42:54,270
under certain circumstances.

291
00:42:54,470 --> 00:43:03,452
One is the placebo effect, sometimes you may see impressive cures, very seldom

292
00:43:03,652 --> 00:43:07,532
but still you can.

293
00:43:07,732 --> 00:43:18,152
Another situation is when people believe very much in some gurus or saintly people

294
00:43:18,352 --> 00:43:31,359
or some people with supernatural powers and they go to them, they prostrate,

295
00:43:31,559 --> 00:43:45,894
they pray etc. and due to this faith the organism can be aroused and can cure

296
00:43:46,094 --> 00:43:49,464
a chronic condition.

297
00:43:49,664 --> 00:43:58,882
A chronic condition also can be cured, several times I had the opportunity to see

298
00:43:59,082 --> 00:44:12,258
it, when a mother has a child which is very bad and seems he's going to die and

299
00:44:12,458 --> 00:44:31,396
the mother prays to God... whatever is her belief...

300
00:44:31,596 --> 00:44:43,140
that power of praying can cure the child from one hour to the other.

301
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:52,139
What is this? A similar disease has come? No.

302
00:44:52,339 --> 00:45:05,785
It is the fact that we are all connected on another level and a good wish for

303
00:45:05,985 --> 00:45:14,928
the other people is of great power. A real good wish is of great power.

304
00:45:15,128 --> 00:45:24,607
You cannot imagine how much. Like the bad wish it can kill.

305
00:45:24,807 --> 00:45:37,715
What they call the black magic... It's a bad wish, bad feelings for another person.

306
00:45:37,915 --> 00:45:45,745
That's why it is so important that the humans understand the idea of forgiveness.

307
00:45:45,945 --> 00:45:52,225
You see, if they have done something to you and they have hurt you...

308
00:45:52,425 --> 00:46:02,516
If you can forgive that means in yourself you don't hold any grudges, any ill feelings.

309
00:46:02,716 --> 00:46:09,718
They did whatever, they try to kill you they try to do this and that, forget it.

310
00:46:09,918 --> 00:46:13,266
If you really forget it, then there is no problem.

311
00:46:13,466 --> 00:46:22,386
But if inside you, you keep the hatred of that particular person whoever it might be

312
00:46:22,586 --> 00:46:31,783
every time you see him and you want to kill him, then you have a problem.

313
00:46:31,983 --> 00:46:43,692
And the problem needs what remedy?

314
00:46:43,892 --> 00:46:56,839
Needs Hyoscyamus. It has these feelings of wanting to kill the other person,

315
00:46:57,749 --> 00:47:14,283
Hyoscyamous desires to kill. How is connected Homeopathy with that level I am talking about?

316
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:22,881
It is the energy level on which we all float and we are connected.

317
00:47:23,081 --> 00:47:27,337
You cannot imagine.

318
00:47:27,537 --> 00:47:34,000
You may be in America and something happens to your son and you wake up

319
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:38,155
in the night and say oh my God something happened to my son.

320
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:46,878
Then they call you and they say he had an accident. This is so common.

321
00:47:53,821 --> 00:48:03,630
-What about the person that receives the hate of the other? What happens to him?

322
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:07,627
From the chronic hate of the other?

323
00:48:07,827 --> 00:48:14,960
-He has to do more work than others. He has to do more inner work than others.

324
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:25,816
You have to work internally to control yourself. You cannot control the others.

325
00:48:26,016 --> 00:48:34,241
The others will keep on doing it. The only thing we can do is to work in our

326
00:48:34,441 --> 00:48:48,036
inner state and understand how harmful it is to keep negative emotions

327
00:48:48,236 --> 00:48:56,201
and it is very good, very healing to ignore.

328
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:15,892
People who ignore are the most happy. [speaks in Greek]

329
00:49:17,248 --> 00:49:26,383
There is an expression in Greek which says "he is a donkey".

330
00:49:26,583 --> 00:49:45,586
That means he is a person who does not take into the heart any kind of abuse or ...

331
00:49:45,786 --> 00:49:50,602
he is a mule.

332
00:49:50,802 --> 00:50:07,957
The thick skin people are most of the time happy. This is very strange but it is true.

333
00:50:37,274 --> 00:50:44,511
Paragraph 71, "Now, since it is subject to no further doubt, that human diseases

334
00:50:44,711 --> 00:50:51,752
consist merely in groups of certain symptoms..."

335
00:50:51,952 --> 00:50:58,886
This means natural diseases are nothing else but groups of symptoms.

336
00:50:59,086 --> 00:51:10,597
This represents the disease. If somebody has no symptoms, he says I'm well.

337
00:51:10,797 --> 00:51:17,195
He will never go to the doctor and it is strange.

338
00:51:17,395 --> 00:51:23,781
In the ancient Greece where most of the people were healthy

339
00:51:23,981 --> 00:51:37,959
for someone to be going into the so-called doctors it was a shame

340
00:51:38,159 --> 00:51:46,706
and he would hide it because most of the population were healthy people

341
00:51:46,906 --> 00:51:53,719
with healthy ideas.

342
00:51:59,569 --> 00:52:05,962
"...diseases consist merely in groups of certain symptoms, and that these may be

343
00:52:06,162 --> 00:52:16,282
extinguished, and the system restored to health only by means of a medicinal

344
00:52:16,482 --> 00:52:23,180
substance possessing the power of producing artificial, morbid symptoms,

345
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:32,079
similar to the disease (whereon rests the process of every genuine cure),

346
00:52:33,436 --> 00:52:43,661
the business of curing will depend on the solution of the following problems :

347
00:52:43,861 --> 00:52:51,215
I. How does the physician gain the knowledge of disease, necessary for the

348
00:52:51,415 --> 00:53:03,771
purpose  of cure?" How logically he leads to the idea of the disease being

349
00:53:03,971 --> 00:53:14,249
nothing else but the manifestation of symptoms so he says the main problem is

350
00:53:14,449 --> 00:53:23,199
now first how the physician gains the knowledge of disease,

351
00:53:23,399 --> 00:53:34,845
necessary for the purpose of cure. He gathers the knowledge of the symptoms.

352
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:44,145
"II. How does he gain his knowledge of the morbific power of drugs,

353
00:53:44,345 --> 00:53:49,661
as the implements designed for the cure of natural diseases?"

354
00:53:49,861 --> 00:54:02,503
He learns that through these symptoms we have this type of disease

355
00:54:02,703 --> 00:54:11,515
and then he learns that by giving certain remedies to a healthy person

356
00:54:11,715 --> 00:54:20,814
you gather information for each substance and

357
00:54:21,014 --> 00:54:30,428
"III. How does he apply these artificial, morbific potencies (drugs) most effectively

358
00:54:30,628 --> 00:54:42,785
in the cure of diseases?" The 3rd is how to apply these agents to the

359
00:54:42,985 --> 00:54:50,416
symptomatology that he has gathered before.

360
00:54:50,616 --> 00:54:59,260
"Regarding the first point, the following may serve as a general illustration.

361
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:04,835
Diseases peculiar to mankind, are of two classes.

362
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:12,228
The first includes rapid, morbid processes caused by abnormal states and

363
00:55:12,428 --> 00:55:17,832
derangement of the vital force; such affections usually run their course

364
00:55:18,032 --> 00:55:24,111
within a brief period of variable duration and are called acute diseases."

365
00:55:26,443 --> 00:55:34,727
I don't know if for the first time or it is a knowledge already that there are

366
00:55:34,927 --> 00:55:38,589
two types of diseases according to Hahnemann.

367
00:55:38,789 --> 00:55:46,338
One is acute diseases and the other type is chronic diseases.

368
00:55:46,538 --> 00:55:52,693
"The second class embraces diseases which often seem trifling and imperceptible

369
00:55:52,893 --> 00:56:08,809
in the beginning; but which, in a manner peculiar to themselves, act deleteriously

370
00:56:17,677 --> 00:56:24,220
upon the living organism, dynamically deranging the latter, and insidiously

371
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:30,861
undermining its health to such a degree, that the automatic energy of the vital force,

372
00:56:31,061 --> 00:56:37,519
designed for the preservation of life, can only make imperfect and ineffectual

373
00:56:37,719 --> 00:56:46,284
resistance to these diseases in their beginning, as well as during their progress."

374
00:57:08,502 --> 00:57:18,318
In a child you give a vaccination and the child feels the prick and that's it.

375
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:30,746
You forget about it but at this moment has started an imperceptible process

376
00:57:30,946 --> 00:57:42,974
of degeneration of the organism, which will end up one day or another,

377
00:57:46,063 --> 00:57:53,288
maybe after a year or 10 years will end up in a serious chronic condition.

378
00:57:55,457 --> 00:58:03,178
He says, the organism does not recognize these first imperceptible changes

379
00:58:03,378 --> 00:58:07,369
in the beginning, so it does not take action.

380
00:58:07,569 --> 00:58:22,906
Therefore no symptoms or suffering. The disease progresses in a subtle manner.

381
00:58:23,106 --> 00:58:28,945
And then it reaches a point where the organism understands the danger and

382
00:58:29,145 --> 00:58:44,628
suddenly is aroused and it sends its defense forces to the point

383
00:58:44,828 --> 00:58:49,823
where the main problem is located.

384
00:58:57,943 --> 00:59:01,592
This is what he says here.

385
00:59:16,312 --> 00:59:22,157
Similar thing happens with acute diseases.

386
00:59:22,357 --> 00:59:34,418
In acute diseases we have what we call a prodromal period

387
00:59:34,618 --> 00:59:43,320
in which the organism understands very little that something is happening.

388
00:59:43,520 --> 01:00:03,951
As this prodromal period is coming more and more, then eventually there is a climax

389
01:00:04,151 --> 01:00:11,751
and the organism this time arouses all possible defenses.

390
01:00:11,951 --> 01:00:36,120
And there is very high fever and even there are concomitant symptoms like

391
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:49,888
excessive perspiration and the inflammation in the bronchi...

392
01:00:51,244 --> 01:01:08,325
When the inflammation is in the bronchi, that means there are seeds of the microbes,

393
01:01:08,525 --> 01:01:30,395
of the virus, of bacteria and then the blood mobilizes the defenses and tries to block

394
01:01:30,595 --> 01:01:44,453
the expansion of the morbific agent and creates a lot of mucus.

395
01:01:46,972 --> 01:01:53,109
If the mucus will stay, the person will die, he cannot breath anymore.

396
01:01:53,309 --> 01:02:03,571
As a second or a third line of defense the organism mobilizes the coughing.

397
01:02:03,771 --> 01:02:13,056
It's necessary in order to save the life of the person to get out the mucus that

398
01:02:13,256 --> 01:02:22,853
was gathered there in order to limit the expansion of the microbes.

399
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:37,341
So you see how unwise could be to give anti-inflammatory drugs first or to give

400
01:02:37,541 --> 01:02:44,361
sedatives for the coughing, codeine and things like that.

401
01:02:44,561 --> 01:02:56,864
You reduce the coughing, you reduce the fever and as a result instead of

402
01:02:57,064 --> 01:03:02,566
the bronchitis taking 5-6 days, it's going to take 20 days to recover

403
01:03:02,766 --> 01:03:11,443
or sometimes can never recover. It can become a chronic asthmatic condition.

404
01:03:17,056 --> 01:03:22,851
The homeopathic treatment does not suppress anything.

405
01:03:23,051 --> 01:03:29,985
What it says to the organism is I will give extra energy so you cough more, you bring

406
01:03:30,185 --> 01:03:43,958
out more mucus and so therefore the whole organism will become more balanced

407
01:03:44,158 --> 01:03:54,269
as a whole and not as a local effect of the medicine.

408
01:04:01,236 --> 01:04:08,961
All this idea is very logical. He proceeds in a very logical way.

409
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:26,243
Of course there are some points which need to be explained.

410
01:04:59,943 --> 01:05:04,643
"...the vital force, designed for the preservation of life, can only make imperfect and

411
01:05:04,843 --> 01:05:10,000
ineffectual resistance to these diseases".

412
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:21,148
If the vital force is left alone the resistance is imperfect and it's not effective.

413
01:05:21,348 --> 01:05:31,099
Therefore what we do? We give extra energy to the reaction and then

414
01:05:31,299 --> 01:05:41,730
we give the necessary energy for the organism to overcome the disease.

415
01:05:41,930 --> 01:05:50,144
And that is why you give an energy, a 30CH dose and there is an amelioration and

416
01:05:50,344 --> 01:06:00,729
in a few hours there is a relapse, then you give 200CH, more powerful stimulation

417
01:06:00,929 --> 01:06:09,446
and then you need to go to 1M and then 10M before the disease is extinguished.

418
01:06:09,646 --> 01:06:16,010
Actually what you are giving, when you give the homeopathic remedy, is an extra

419
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:27,818
power to the defense mechanism. But that power is directed in such a way that it is

420
01:06:28,018 --> 01:06:35,670
of the same quality as the defense mechanism.

421
01:06:35,870 --> 01:06:42,058
As the vital force at this moment fighting through these symptoms.

422
01:06:42,258 --> 01:06:45,420
You give a remedy you know it has produced similar symptoms, then there is

423
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:52,903
an increase on the symptoms, there is an initial aggravation.

424
01:06:53,103 --> 01:06:56,078
This is why we say initial aggravation is very good.

425
01:06:56,278 --> 01:07:08,153
Because you gave a power to react the organism, to get rid of the disease.

426
01:07:11,521 --> 01:07:13,691
I think this is enough.

427
01:07:13,891 --> 01:07:22,457
After giving indicated remedy if new symptoms appear on skin which were not

428
01:07:22,657 --> 01:07:37,451
old skin symptoms of that patient is the case going ...

429
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:45,819
I don't understand who puts the question?

430
01:08:00,112 --> 01:08:21,100
After giving indicated remedy if new symptoms appear on skin, which were not

431
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:33,273
old skin symptoms of that patient, is the case going to the right direction?

432
01:08:33,473 --> 01:08:38,733
Most probably it is going to the right direction.

433
01:08:38,933 --> 01:08:54,165
Of course it will depend on the type of the skin eruption. The idea is this.

434
01:08:54,365 --> 01:09:02,828
You are treating a chronic condition of a patient who has certain suffering and

435
01:09:03,028 --> 01:09:09,100
then you give a remedy and then there is a skin eruption that was not there before.

436
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:18,019
If the skin eruption is now much more suffering, maybe you have stimulated

437
01:09:18,219 --> 01:09:24,751
something... I don't know such a case but I can imagine.

438
01:09:24,951 --> 01:09:32,466
If the skin eruption is minor, it's very good reaction.

439
01:09:32,666 --> 01:09:44,219
If the skin eruption is not an aggressive, malignant eruption the case is Ok.

440
01:09:44,419 --> 01:09:55,159
I would like to know what are your thoughts on effects of contraceptive surgeries

441
01:09:55,359 --> 01:10:09,680
like tubectomy or vasectomy on body and mind. You put me difficult questions.

442
01:10:17,558 --> 01:10:29,100
This means a woman does not want to have further pregnancies and they tie

443
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:44,298
the fallopian tubes. And what its effect can be on the body and mind?

444
01:11:15,651 --> 01:11:26,752
All organs they have their own place in the organism.

445
01:11:26,952 --> 01:11:43,006
To take out an organ or to nullify an organ in this case, it cannot be a good thing.

446
01:11:43,206 --> 01:11:47,521
There is definitely going to be a side effect.

447
01:11:47,721 --> 01:12:00,000
What kind of effect would be in a woman that does this, I cannot say.

448
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:04,149
Because maybe it compensates.

449
01:12:04,349 --> 01:12:08,732
If the organism is quite healthy, she can compensate.

450
01:12:08,932 --> 01:12:16,227
Definitely there is going to be an effect.

451
01:12:16,427 --> 01:12:29,484
It used to be very much in fashion in my young age when tonsils were affecting...

452
01:12:29,684 --> 01:12:37,101
to take out the tonsils. It proved to be a very bad thing.

453
01:12:40,809 --> 01:12:51,379
I remember I was 11 when I took out the tonsils, I was in a bloody hospital in Athens

454
01:12:51,579 --> 01:13:05,795
during the German occupation. It was 1943, it was during the war, in the hospital

455
01:13:05,995 --> 01:13:17,428
there were no injections, nothing. I went there and almost cold blooded, he started

456
01:13:17,628 --> 01:13:23,171
cutting, it was a traumatic experience.

457
01:13:23,371 --> 01:13:33,326
It was in the basement and said go up to the 1st floor to your bed. So I went like this.

458
01:13:33,526 --> 01:13:43,738
I did not faint and managed to go in my bed but this cost me the rest of my life.

459
01:13:43,938 --> 01:13:50,794
You may not want to know how. I am not going to tell you now.

460
01:13:50,994 --> 01:13:59,203
But really I had to fight a lot. And I know people who have taken out their tonsils...

461
01:13:59,403 --> 01:14:08,193
it's not so simple. They are the guardians of the respiratory system and they are

462
01:14:08,393 --> 01:14:18,010
the first to catch up microbes, be inflamed and stop the disease up there.

463
01:14:18,210 --> 01:14:23,934
If you don't have the guardians, then the disease will go inside much easier.

464
01:14:24,134 --> 01:14:36,957
So it's not simple to cut whatever organ.

465
01:14:43,034 --> 01:14:49,230
You say how people live without their thyroid gland, they take out the thyroid and

466
01:14:49,430 --> 01:14:58,295
they take replacement of the hormones and they can go on living.

467
01:14:58,495 --> 01:15:14,519
But closing the fallopian tubes, you cannot replace it. The ovaries keep on functioning.

468
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:22,670
Where are the ovaries going? How they are killed inside the organism.

469
01:15:22,870 --> 01:15:32,002
Lots of complication could happen and could take place.

470
01:15:32,202 --> 01:15:39,486
Most probably the mind is affected as well, I don't know how

471
01:15:39,686 --> 01:15:44,756
but it's not possible not to be affected.

472
01:15:54,323 --> 01:16:03,159
It is not good to take away the organs like the bladder.

473
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:09,975
They say "Take it out, no problem!"

474
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:25,535
-Concerning the removal of the tonsils, in my country it used to be

475
01:16:25,735 --> 01:16:38,641
when I was a child and 10-20 years before many of them don't have tonsils.

476
01:16:38,841 --> 01:16:43,521
Almost every child who repeated 2-3 times tonsillitis they removed it.

477
01:16:43,721 --> 01:16:51,251
I was lucky, I have them still. In the cases I have seen the last years

478
01:16:51,451 --> 01:16:57,451
there could be an interesting study to be done.

479
01:16:57,651 --> 01:17:05,010
I have not seen so many cases but in the cases I have seen it's like a connection

480
01:17:05,210 --> 01:17:15,855
cancer cases and severe autoimmune diseases 8-9/10 do not have tonsils.

481
01:17:16,055 --> 01:17:24,761
This is what I have observed very clearly. Only a few hundred cases, may be thousands.

482
01:17:24,961 --> 01:17:28,131
I don't know. This is one.

483
01:17:28,331 --> 01:17:41,186
And about the other issue, the fallopian tubes are bound so the eggs won't go out

484
01:17:41,386 --> 01:17:48,703
but it's the same thing the fallopian tubes are out of action.

485
01:17:48,903 --> 01:17:53,436
This happens very frequently nowadays in my country, even without the woman

486
01:17:53,636 --> 01:17:57,619
knowing after the birth if she has 1 or 2 children, the doctor does it.

487
01:17:57,819 --> 01:18:03,323
It's an abuse but this is how things happen. Because they say you have 1 or 2

488
01:18:03,523 --> 01:18:08,958
children it's Ok, I am making you a favor by doing this.

489
01:18:09,158 --> 01:18:15,324
I have seen female patients who have come for treatment after these operations

490
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:23,040
with a lot of pathology starting from simple heat flushes till I have seen 1-2 almost

491
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:32,024
suicidal cases. Only after this operation. This is the only causative factor.

492
01:18:32,224 --> 01:18:38,684
Nothing else happened in their lives. But most of them had something like menstrual

493
01:18:38,884 --> 01:18:47,184
disturbances, heat flushes and 1-2 severe cases I have seen.

494
01:18:47,384 --> 01:18:55,330
-It depends on the predisposition of the organism whether such an intervention

495
01:18:55,530 --> 01:19:03,538
will have a severe effect or a milder effect. It will depend on the sensitivity of the

496
01:19:03,738 --> 01:19:15,164
organism and the predisposition but definitely this was not a good practice.

497
01:19:15,364 --> 01:19:23,148
Concerning this matter from my understanding the healthiest way of having

498
01:19:23,348 --> 01:19:39,044
prevention if they don't want children is the condom for a woman and man.

499
01:19:39,244 --> 01:19:51,918
The next is IUD the Intra-Uterus-Device but still it can inflame the uterus and

500
01:19:52,118 --> 01:20:00,338
it can cause a set of bacteria.

501
01:20:01,811 --> 01:20:10,784
-If the autoimmune disease is connected to the removal of the tonsils then since

502
01:20:10,984 --> 01:20:16,205
this organ cannot be replaced there is no homeopathic cure for this disease?

503
01:20:16,405 --> 01:20:28,976
-No homeopathic cure... There are cases in which the fallopian tubes are closed

504
01:20:29,176 --> 01:20:40,284
because of inflammation. They get inflamed and they close.

505
01:20:40,484 --> 01:20:47,848
For this there is a possibility for cure.

506
01:20:48,048 --> 01:20:58,767
The fallopian tube reactivate the old inflammatory process and opens it up.

507
01:20:58,967 --> 01:21:10,698
But if you close mechanically they tied it, you cannot open it again.

508
01:21:10,898 --> 01:21:19,831
The only thing is if there are side effects upon this action, you may reduce them

509
01:21:20,031 --> 01:21:30,779
with homeopathic remedy. He was saying for flushes of heat or hyperhidrosis

510
01:21:30,979 --> 01:21:39,636
or anomalies in the menses, pain during, before or after menses.

511
01:21:39,836 --> 01:21:45,019
All these can be regulated with the homeopathic remedy.

512
01:21:45,219 --> 01:21:51,449
But still they will remain as a traumatic point in the organism.

513
01:21:51,649 --> 01:21:57,302
-But my question was about the autoimmune disease as a consequence of the

514
01:21:57,502 --> 01:22:03,383
tonsils removal. So tonsils are removed, you cannot replace them.

515
01:22:03,583 --> 01:22:09,800
Does that mean these types of autoimmune diseases cannot be cured

516
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,395
homeopathically?

517
01:22:12,595 --> 01:22:19,673
-Some may be cured, some may not. It depends on the level of health.

518
01:22:22,491 --> 01:22:28,734
If an organism is weak and they take the tonsils out and then on the top of this

519
01:22:28,934 --> 01:22:37,534
there are antibiotics... it's going to be an incurable case, eventually.

520
01:22:37,734 --> 01:22:47,419
-What about tumors that obstruct or push an organ or they obstruct a function

521
01:22:47,619 --> 01:22:55,525
like big fibroids that push other organs? Is it against the homeopathic rules

522
01:22:55,725 --> 01:22:59,729
to operate them?

523
01:22:59,929 --> 01:23:16,241
-If there are fibroids which because of their size, they close the entrance through

524
01:23:16,441 --> 01:23:30,873
the fallopian tubes, then it will be Ok to remove that portion that closes and free

525
01:23:31,073 --> 01:23:37,924
the ovaries to come to the uterus. It will be Ok.

526
01:23:38,124 --> 01:23:43,351
-I had some cases in the past history they had their fibroids removed and within a

527
01:23:43,551 --> 01:23:49,586
few months they had them grown again and even bigger than before.

528
01:23:49,786 --> 01:24:01,291
-That is true also. These cases could end up in malignancy.

529
01:24:01,491 --> 01:24:11,093
If there is a tendency for malignancy, you will see them immediately coming up.

530
01:24:13,963 --> 01:24:21,496
Many times I have cases where a woman comes and says I don't have a child.

531
01:24:21,696 --> 01:24:32,068
I will commit suicide. In such cases you are permitted, if you cannot handle it

532
01:24:32,268 --> 01:24:41,485
with Homeopathy and a surgery can take away the obstruction,

533
01:24:41,685 --> 01:24:47,534
I would advise to do it.

534
01:24:47,734 --> 01:24:50,556
-And then come back with good homeopathic treatment?

535
01:24:50,756 --> 01:24:54,544
-Yes, continue with homeopathic treatment. I think I told you about a case I was

536
01:24:54,744 --> 01:25:09,683
treating for 5-6 years with a uterus that was so full of fibroids, it was like a stone.

537
01:25:09,883 --> 01:25:14,997
So the idea of having a child was forgotten.

538
01:25:15,197 --> 01:25:25,606
After 5 years of treatment for different things she was a "customer".

539
01:25:25,806 --> 01:25:33,014
She was coming for a checkup etc... One day she became pregnant.

540
01:25:33,214 --> 01:25:44,047
With that uterus the gynecologist who knew  had said to her before

541
01:25:44,247 --> 01:25:51,180
that you cannot have a child. But I did not know that.

542
01:25:51,380 --> 01:25:59,564
So I asked her when she told me she was pregnant... I don't want to tell you to

543
01:25:59,764 --> 01:26:07,349
sit down quietly in a bed, it's very easy to detach.

544
01:26:07,549 --> 01:26:12,105
So I advised her to go to the gynecologist to get an advice so he could take

545
01:26:12,305 --> 01:26:16,371
the responsibility telling her staying in bed, don't move.

546
01:26:17,749 --> 01:26:26,934
She went to the gynecologist and he said no problem, continue your normal life.

547
01:26:27,134 --> 01:26:39,990
She called me and I said " did he say normal life? She said, there is no problem.

548
01:26:40,190 --> 01:26:47,892
I could not say anything because he was the specialist.

549
01:26:48,092 --> 01:26:57,925
So she was continuing, the 3rd or the 4th month she went into a car and she went

550
01:26:58,125 --> 01:27:09,127
in a road with bumps. When they returned home it starts...

551
01:27:11,187 --> 01:27:17,460
So 5 a.m. her husband comes to my house, knocks the door, he says my wife

552
01:27:17,660 --> 01:27:26,996
is bleeding. I took the symptoms and I gave him some medicine.

553
01:27:27,196 --> 01:27:32,274
In the morning no pharmacy was there but I gave my own medicine.

554
01:27:32,474 --> 01:27:37,802
Get this medicine and go back. In the meantime he called the gynecologist.

555
01:27:38,002 --> 01:27:51,402
The gynecologist he had such an attitude that it was unbelievable.

556
01:27:51,602 --> 01:28:02,323
He said to her, reserve a place to the hospital where I operate, he indicated

557
01:28:02,523 --> 01:28:09,921
the hospital and if I save your life, you will be lucky.

558
01:28:10,121 --> 01:28:18,598
I told you you cannot have a child. But that it was told 10 years ago.

559
01:28:21,351 --> 01:28:28,869
They call me and said that the gynecologist said that we have to go immediately

560
01:28:29,069 --> 01:28:38,153
to the hospital and if he manages, it's so urgent, the bleeding was so much,

561
01:28:38,353 --> 01:28:45,163
that if I save your life you will be lucky.

562
01:28:45,363 --> 01:28:51,673
In the meantime 5- 5.30 had started with the medicine, 7.00 now...

563
01:28:51,873 --> 01:29:01,675
I said between 5.30 and 7.00 the bleeding was the same in amount or less?

564
01:29:01,875 --> 01:29:10,487
He said I think it's less. I said Ok, don't go to the hospital.

565
01:29:15,915 --> 01:29:21,762
They constantly called me to be in touch. 13.00 they called me, now I have been

566
01:29:21,962 --> 01:29:31,755
in their place and I know the telephone is not in their bedroom it is only in the hall.

567
01:29:31,955 --> 01:29:39,184
So she calls me and tells me the bleeding is very little.

568
01:29:39,384 --> 01:29:54,869
I said you are not in bed, she said no... I am going to have an abortion.

569
01:29:55,069 --> 01:30:09,518
I said no, go back and lie in bed and don't move at all and just keep me informed.

570
01:30:13,401 --> 01:30:24,832
I am talking about 1969- 1970, I am talking about a 50 year old case.

571
01:30:25,032 --> 01:30:29,477
She had a very healthy child. Of course she never had another.

572
01:30:29,677 --> 01:30:37,069
The uterus expanded and remained expanded. It could not contract anymore.

573
01:30:37,269 --> 01:30:45,115
It was like a stone and eventually she had to remove the uterus.

574
01:30:45,315 --> 01:30:55,742
But the child is 50 years old and she frequently comes to Skopelos.

575
01:30:55,942 --> 01:31:06,401
They have a house and they come. But we have seen such things happening.

576
01:31:06,601 --> 01:31:12,750
Can we every time do the same? I am not sure.

577
01:31:12,950 --> 01:31:18,389
Neither I treated the uterus, I was treating the whole person.

578
01:31:18,589 --> 01:31:29,244
The uterus together with the person got better, more elastic, managed to expand

579
01:31:29,444 --> 01:31:30,667
and she was a happy woman.
