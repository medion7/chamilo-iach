1
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:25,565
I think there is a question here.

2
00:00:25,765 --> 00:00:36,290
"If a patient comes with chronic eczema and he were not in homeopathic

3
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:48,911
medicine previously, when we prescribe correct remedy to him, where do you

4
00:00:49,111 --> 00:00:57,949
see aggravation generally? What kind of aggravation we may expect?"

5
00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:09,124
What kind of aggravation we expect in a case where there is no previous remedy.

6
00:01:09,324 --> 00:01:14,196
A person comes straight away to Homeopathy with an eczema to be treated.

7
00:01:14,396 --> 00:01:22,869
The aggravation you will see in the eczema itself. And it can be one of these cases

8
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:29,541
where you can see really the aggravation in front of your eyes is with the eczema

9
00:01:29,741 --> 00:01:31,942
patients.

10
00:01:32,142 --> 00:01:39,387
First of all the eczema becomes bigger, then the itching for 1-2 days is more and then,

11
00:01:39,587 --> 00:01:49,627
if the remedy is correct, the eczema will start going out from above downwards.

12
00:01:52,184 --> 00:02:05,237
The eczema may all here on the arm and will end up the last months in the fingers.

13
00:02:05,437 --> 00:02:13,877
This is the right direction. You are absolutely sure you have given the right remedy.

14
00:02:18,837 --> 00:02:22,636
But there is an aggravation definitely.

15
00:02:26,837 --> 00:02:32,179
Something else you have to be careful that these people who have severe eczemas,

16
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:40,754
they usually use creams to cover the itching and the eczema and before giving the

17
00:02:40,954 --> 00:02:47,960
remedy, you have to tell him to stop the creams for a period of time, you may need

18
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:59,026
even one month without any medications before you see the real extent of the

19
00:02:59,226 --> 00:03:02,690
eczema.

20
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:09,170
So he has to stay without any medication for 1 month and then take the remedy.

21
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:19,049
Otherwise you will have the following problem; you know you are expecting an

22
00:03:19,249 --> 00:03:24,863
aggravation after the right remedy, then he stops the medication and the next day

23
00:03:25,063 --> 00:03:29,721
he takes the remedy and there is aggravation.

24
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:35,503
Now after a month you don't know whether the aggravation was due to stopping

25
00:03:35,703 --> 00:03:40,861
the cream or because of your remedy.

26
00:03:41,061 --> 00:03:47,562
And then you have to wait 2-3 months to see that the eczema is not going well

27
00:03:47,762 --> 00:03:53,565
in order to understand the remedy is wrong and you have to change it.

28
00:04:02,923 --> 00:04:14,945
Come here. Everyone must come here so he can be on the video.

29
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:30,184
-What about if there is pus, they got an inflammation? When they stop the cortisone

30
00:04:30,384 --> 00:04:42,462
if it is a severe eczema to see and the pus is coming... It's inflamed. They scratch...

31
00:04:42,662 --> 00:04:52,845
-If stopping the cortisone you see a big aggravation, you give the remedy.

32
00:04:53,045 --> 00:04:57,998
You don't have to wait for a month. That means the organism is strong and will give

33
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:02,762
out immediately, what was suppressed will come out immediately.

34
00:05:02,962 --> 00:05:07,683
That is a good sign actually and you can give the remedy straight away

35
00:05:07,883 --> 00:05:12,448
upon the aggravation, after stopping the cream.

36
00:05:12,648 --> 00:05:19,713
-Also then what is your experience concerning potencies?

37
00:05:19,913 --> 00:05:25,486
-Potencies in eczemas don't have to be very high. 200CH is a good potency for

38
00:05:25,686 --> 00:05:30,214
an eczema, 1M and in relapses you may have to go higher.

39
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:35,598
But starting with 200CH is a good idea.

40
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:55,754
-I have 2 questions. The first is if people, because you said that we know that skin

41
00:05:55,954 --> 00:06:00,368
eruptions are good, what about people who get artificial skin problems, for example

42
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:09,280
bee stings, have edemas...So are these people more protected than others to have

43
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:14,120
the pathology expressed on the skin?

44
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:20,221
Because they are stung and they have edemas. So these people are more healthy?

45
00:06:21,577 --> 00:06:29,672
-When somebody is stung by a bee it can have a little pimple with a little pain and

46
00:06:29,872 --> 00:06:42,753
scratch, it can have a bigger aggravation and can have also (some allergic people)

47
00:06:42,953 --> 00:06:57,477
a total reaction and they can die. There are different reactions to the bee sting.

48
00:06:57,677 --> 00:07:13,916
But as a general rule, if somebody has been bitten by a bee and has not died

49
00:07:14,116 --> 00:07:20,781
that means he had the typical reaction, it is a good thing for the organism to be

50
00:07:20,981 --> 00:07:27,578
bitten by bees. The problem is not to be bitten by 20 bees at the same time.

51
00:07:27,778 --> 00:07:29,788
That is not good.

52
00:07:29,988 --> 00:07:36,533
-The honey producers for example are bitten...

53
00:07:36,733 --> 00:07:46,023
-They are immune usually to the bee sting and also they usually have a good

54
00:07:46,223 --> 00:07:54,047
healthy organism. The beekeepers are a strange phenomenon...

55
00:07:54,247 --> 00:08:04,699
All the beekeepers I have met they are balanced, down-to-earth people

56
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:12,601
with good emotion and happy life.

57
00:08:12,801 --> 00:08:22,372
I am talking about the beekeepers who are fanatics. They like the bees very much.

58
00:08:22,572 --> 00:08:27,719
These are the people whom I found out are good people, with good heart,

59
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:33,142
good organism, bitten by bees many times, no problem and it's good for them to be

60
00:08:33,342 --> 00:08:46,443
bitten. I have bees also and I have been bitten several times and I am careful now

61
00:08:46,643 --> 00:08:57,715
not to be bitten by the bees because maybe they will bite me around the eye and

62
00:08:57,915 --> 00:09:03,312
my eyes will be closed. So I don't want to come here and you are scared.

63
00:09:06,058 --> 00:09:14,797
One time I was bitten by the bee and I had to travel the next day to Holland,

64
00:09:14,997 --> 00:09:22,544
where I had a seminar. I was bitten by the bee and the swelling was terrifying,

65
00:09:22,744 --> 00:09:28,200
it closed my eyes and I said to the secretary I have to leave tomorrow but it's not

66
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:35,715
possible, I have to have an excuse because people are gathering after 2 days

67
00:09:35,915 --> 00:09:40,481
in Holland for a seminar and I cannot go.

68
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:48,926
So please bring the camera and take my condition because it was becoming worse

69
00:09:49,126 --> 00:09:57,207
and worse. In the meantime we found the camera, we prepared everything and

70
00:09:57,407 --> 00:10:05,067
then while she was filming me, she said I see through the camera that it's

71
00:10:05,267 --> 00:10:14,618
going away, because I have taken Apis before.

72
00:10:15,859 --> 00:10:21,747
We wait, we take another picture later on, if it stays. Later on it was gone and

73
00:10:21,947 --> 00:10:30,970
I travelled and they could not see anything. Apis helped me very much.

74
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:37,290
Apis is a very good remedy for that, as you all know.

75
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:41,784
And I can confirm it from my own experience.

76
00:10:41,984 --> 00:10:49,097
-My second question, if we have an acute incident and we have a clear picture

77
00:10:49,297 --> 00:10:56,813
of a remedy but suppose we don't have access to a remedy and we let the organism

78
00:10:57,216 --> 00:11:00,485
go through the acute by itself.

79
00:11:01,012 --> 00:11:05,876
Is it better to leave it like this or is it better to give the remedy?

80
00:11:06,076 --> 00:11:10,337
Because sometimes we have a flu and we say Ok I won't get a remedy,

81
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:14,172
there is a clear picture and then it goes away by itself. Is it as good?

82
00:11:14,485 --> 00:11:21,843
-It depends. Sometimes if the organism is weak, if you let an acute run,

83
00:11:22,503 --> 00:11:26,178
it takes all the energy and there is a relapse.

84
00:11:26,378 --> 00:11:32,995
If the organism is strong, there is no problem. You can let it go.

85
00:11:33,195 --> 00:11:38,547
-Even in the second case where the organism is strong, is it better to leave it without

86
00:11:38,747 --> 00:11:45,187
a remedy or is it better to give a remedy, since you have the picture?

87
00:11:45,387 --> 00:11:54,988
-Give the remedy. There is one more question.

88
00:11:55,188 --> 00:12:05,402
The caesarian section is very often done where it is not necessary.

89
00:12:05,602 --> 00:12:17,793
How does the C.S. influence such babies? The C.S. often produced because of pelvic

90
00:12:17,993 --> 00:12:22,577
presentation of a baby.

91
00:12:24,957 --> 00:12:31,155
This breech presentation is something that you cannot avoid and maybe they have

92
00:12:31,355 --> 00:12:43,690
to do it, the C.S. There are many times where a remedy given a few days before

93
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:52,095
birth, turns the child in a very impressive way to the right position.

94
00:12:52,295 --> 00:13:02,718
And this is done mostly by Pulsatilla. Puls. has acted many times, this is our experience.

95
00:13:02,918 --> 00:13:11,239
We are conducting at this moment a research in one of the public hospitals

96
00:13:11,439 --> 00:13:15,461
in Athens but we don't have enough cases.

97
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:21,057
The Greeks who are here they can hear and send some cases of their own.

98
00:13:21,257 --> 00:13:31,928
When there is a breech presentation and the time of birth is approaching,

99
00:13:32,128 --> 00:13:39,201
it has to be over 34 weeks, they can send it to the "Aretaieon" where this program

100
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:44,881
is running.

101
00:13:45,081 --> 00:13:56,968
-I have given Puls. in two occasions 200CH one dose and within 4 hours...

102
00:14:00,496 --> 00:14:05,853
Both times it worked. The positions changed.

103
00:14:07,364 --> 00:14:15,287
-I say this but I will tell you an example. How this information can be used wrongly.

104
00:14:16,448 --> 00:14:23,157
A pregnant woman went to a Greek doctor, she had this problem.

105
00:14:23,357 --> 00:14:31,850
He says don't worry I will speak to the child and will turn.

106
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:38,805
He gave the Pulsatilla and the child turned.

107
00:14:39,005 --> 00:14:50,618
The patient thinks we are magicians. Ok he got the information, he can use it,

108
00:14:50,818 --> 00:14:53,490
but use it properly.

109
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:59,299
Neither I said in every case of breech presentation this will happen.

110
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:04,525
It will happen in many cases, not in every case.

111
00:15:04,725 --> 00:15:13,137
So he was so sure he will speak to the child, so the child will turn.

112
00:15:13,337 --> 00:15:28,390
The trauma of the child because of this incision on the mother and I have not

113
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:38,719
information to tell you for sure that children are traumatized and have this or that.

114
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:45,969
You have. Can you speak? She is a pediatrician.

115
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:56,659
-There are studies which say that children born with C.S. have more allergic diseases.

116
00:15:56,859 --> 00:16:10,679
Eczema, asthma, disorders in learning and attention and behavioral problems and

117
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:17,729
above all the most important thing is that with C.S. the brain of mother does not

118
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:27,931
produce the hormones that are necessary to bond with the child.

119
00:16:28,131 --> 00:16:34,553
All these children cannot be bond with their mother and the opposite, the mother

120
00:16:34,753 --> 00:16:43,017
cannot be related to the child. So we have many people who are not connected.

121
00:16:43,217 --> 00:16:54,632
-Thank you. I like the passion. She is always passionate...

122
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:06,707
In my experience I have not connected that... why the child is born with this or that.

123
00:17:06,907 --> 00:17:12,356
That's why I ask. This is very good information what she says.

124
00:17:12,556 --> 00:17:19,444
That the mother will not go through the whole process, so the hormonal balance

125
00:17:19,644 --> 00:17:27,083
will not be completed, it will stop in a way if the child goes out prematurely.

126
00:17:27,283 --> 00:17:34,874
I have heard cases where they said that the gynecologist was busy because he had

127
00:17:35,074 --> 00:17:48,296
to go to a party at 11 o'clock and the woman had to deliver until 10 the latest.

128
00:17:48,496 --> 00:17:55,073
So he gave some injections and the woman delivered at 10 p.m.

129
00:17:55,273 --> 00:18:02,941
There are such cases, it's not me who criticizes,

130
00:18:03,141 --> 00:18:06,911
everybody criticizes this kind of behavior.

131
00:18:08,965 --> 00:18:21,643
Italian, come here. What is your name?

132
00:18:21,843 --> 00:18:32,150
-Sara. My question is if we give a homeopathic remedy but we don't see

133
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:38,689
an aggravation, but all the symptoms go away in a small period,

134
00:18:38,889 --> 00:18:46,680
how can we distinguish between a suppression or a good remedy given?

135
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:53,003
-That is a good question.

136
00:18:53,203 --> 00:19:00,688
If there is a suppression, the relapse will be within a few days.

137
00:19:00,888 --> 00:19:10,357
That means the amelioration will last 10, 15 days and then the whole thing will be

138
00:19:10,557 --> 00:19:18,107
back. If what you said is correct, because you said all the symptoms are gone,

139
00:19:18,307 --> 00:19:28,935
that means that the remedy was correct when all symptoms are gone.

140
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:34,829
Because in partially indicated remedies, not all symptoms are gone,

141
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:37,519
some symptoms are gone.

142
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:44,548
All symptoms are gone that means without aggravation, it means the person belongs

143
00:19:44,748 --> 00:19:52,781
in the uppermost levels 1,2 where the organism is quite healthy, the pathology is not

144
00:19:52,981 --> 00:19:59,872
deep and there is no perceptible aggravation.

145
00:20:00,072 --> 00:20:07,622
There is always an aggravation but they don't pay attention in these levels.

146
00:20:07,822 --> 00:20:11,241
They say there was no aggravation.

147
00:20:11,441 --> 00:20:15,965
But as the levels go down and the pathology becomes more serious,

148
00:20:16,165 --> 00:20:20,257
then the aggravation is there.

149
00:20:20,457 --> 00:20:25,350
When they tell me I have never seen an aggravation, there are two things.

150
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:31,042
Either you see very healthy people or you don't give the right remedy.

151
00:20:31,242 --> 00:20:39,867
Either of the two is valid. You have to see the aggravation.

152
00:20:41,572 --> 00:20:50,611
I should read to you, according to what you said, an email I received, just saw it today.

153
00:20:50,811 --> 00:21:00,526
He says I am not in Alonissos, he's a person who is coming to Alonissos, I should cry,

154
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:12,883
but I do not cry because I have the Vithoulkas Compass and the effect I see with V.C.

155
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:19,274
now confirms what you have been teaching all along with aggravation,

156
00:21:19,474 --> 00:21:23,612
with symptoms coming back. Now I can see it.

157
00:21:23,812 --> 00:21:30,765
Of course he is a homeopath since 15 years but he had never seen

158
00:21:30,965 --> 00:21:39,330
the initial aggravation, symptoms coming back, so he is surprised.

159
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:42,884
He says my god this is a fantastic tool.

160
00:21:45,441 --> 00:22:01,796
When I hear people saying you drink coffee, there is no problem... No more questions.

161
00:22:15,357 --> 00:22:36,594
Paragraph 81, "The fact that this extremely ancient infecting agent

162
00:22:38,027 --> 00:22:53,620
has gradually passed..." Infecting agent probably he means scabies (psora) because

163
00:22:53,820 --> 00:23:02,732
scabies is the skin eruption that is infecting.

164
00:23:02,932 --> 00:23:08,465
"...  The fact that this extremely ancient infecting agent has gradually passed,

165
00:23:08,665 --> 00:23:17,720
in some hundreds of generations, through many millions of human organisms.."

166
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:32,397
He claims here something which is unbelievable but unfortunately it is true.

167
00:23:32,597 --> 00:23:39,561
You see Medorrhinum and you suspect he has been infected by gonorrhea

168
00:23:39,761 --> 00:23:47,702
so you ask were you infected with gonorrhea? They say no, your father? No.

169
00:23:47,902 --> 00:23:57,771
So yet the infection could have been a few generations behind, a bad infection

170
00:23:57,971 --> 00:24:09,005
that remained in the genes of one generation after the other. This is what he says.

171
00:24:09,205 --> 00:24:18,481
The scabies, the psoric miasm, which has been suppressed, remained in the human

172
00:24:18,681 --> 00:24:26,513
organism for millions of generations.

173
00:24:26,713 --> 00:24:36,719
It is difficult to perceive this aspect but I am afraid it is true.

174
00:24:38,655 --> 00:24:50,078
"...and has thus attained an incredible development, renders it in some measure

175
00:24:50,278 --> 00:25:03,256
conceivable how it can now display such innumerable morbid forms in the great

176
00:25:03,456 --> 00:25:13,579
family of mankind, particularly when we consider what a number of circumstances

177
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:21,875
contribute to the production of these great varieties."

178
00:25:22,075 --> 00:25:29,699
You remember my problem was, now he had a problem himself, he says how and

179
00:25:29,899 --> 00:25:38,606
tries to give an answer. How comes since we all have the basis, which is the same,

180
00:25:38,806 --> 00:25:49,451
the miasm, we have such a variety of pathologies? Let us see what he will say.

181
00:25:59,943 --> 00:26:13,453
"Some of these causes that exercise a modifying influence on the transformation

182
00:26:13,653 --> 00:26:24,903
of psora into chronic diseases manifestly depend sometimes on the climate and

183
00:26:25,103 --> 00:26:34,716
the peculiar physical character of the place of abode,

184
00:26:37,351 --> 00:26:46,917
sometimes on the very great varieties in the physical and mental training of youth,

185
00:26:47,117 --> 00:26:57,641
both of which may have been neglected, delayed or carried to excess,

186
00:26:57,841 --> 00:27:08,727
or on their abuse in the business or conditions of life, in the matter of diet

187
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:18,255
and regimen, passions, manners, habits and customs of various kinds."

188
00:27:18,455 --> 00:27:27,228
He puts himself the question that I was putting yesterday and he gives the answer

189
00:27:27,428 --> 00:27:34,379
how comes it is because of environmental circumstances and also educational,

190
00:27:34,579 --> 00:27:42,605
how the people were raised by their parents, depends on what direction

191
00:27:42,805 --> 00:27:49,422
the pathology will take when it's manifested.

192
00:27:53,720 --> 00:28:00,249
"...great varieties of chronic diseases (secondary symptoms of psora)"

193
00:28:00,449 --> 00:28:05,518
So all these pathologies are considered as secondary symptoms of psora.

194
00:28:05,718 --> 00:28:14,815
"...besides the indescribable diversity of men in respect of their congenital corporeal

195
00:28:15,015 --> 00:28:23,985
constitutions, so that it is no wonder if such a variety of injurious agencies,

196
00:28:24,185 --> 00:28:33,976
acting from within and from without and sometimes continually, on such a variety of

197
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:41,569
organisms permeated with the psoric miasm, should produce an innumerable variety

198
00:28:41,769 --> 00:28:51,516
of defects, injuries, derangements and sufferings, which have hitherto been treated

199
00:28:51,716 --> 00:29:00,494
of in the old pathological works, under a number of special names, as diseases

200
00:29:00,694 --> 00:29:08,924
of an independent character."

201
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:18,459
So this is one of the most advanced ideas of Hahnemann.

202
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:31,314
He dares to say that though the background is the same due to different factors

203
00:29:31,514 --> 00:29:39,638
the direction of pathology takes different ways depending on the character

204
00:29:39,838 --> 00:29:48,562
of the upbringing, of the environment etc.

205
00:29:51,165 --> 00:29:58,639
There is something else. Now, you have to connect it with that.

206
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:16,877
You know that all individuals are unique. No one is the exact duplicate of another.

207
00:30:17,077 --> 00:30:21,991
There is a proof for that.

208
00:30:25,709 --> 00:30:37,223
Fingerprint, correct. If you put your fingerprint it doesn't fit with anybody else's.

209
00:30:37,423 --> 00:30:48,009
That means every organism, 8 billion people are different from each other

210
00:30:48,209 --> 00:30:56,337
and that's why the fingerprint is different from one another.

211
00:30:56,537 --> 00:31:04,401
Because the fingerprint most probably is the overall picture of the structure

212
00:31:04,601 --> 00:31:18,845
of the organism. Showing the character, showing the disease, the health etc.

213
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:32,902
The fingerprints if studied maybe they could reveal better than the genetic code

214
00:31:33,102 --> 00:31:39,023
the predisposition to diseases.

215
00:31:44,677 --> 00:31:54,564
I give ideas for the researchers.

216
00:31:54,764 --> 00:32:11,555
Now I expect that somebody will have an objection. Which should be it?

217
00:32:20,415 --> 00:32:28,055
Many times I've asked myself what is the difference between my observations

218
00:32:28,255 --> 00:32:33,949
and the observations of so many millions of doctors who have not discovered

219
00:32:34,149 --> 00:32:38,913
what I have observed. What is the difference?

220
00:32:39,113 --> 00:32:46,662
I found out a few years ago that I never accepted anything they told me or they

221
00:32:46,862 --> 00:32:56,651
taught me before I pass it through my own critical mind and see whether

222
00:32:56,851 --> 00:33:10,315
that was really logical or it can be true or not. So I told you an idea.

223
00:33:10,515 --> 00:33:27,121
I said 8 billion people are different from each other. We prescribe individually, we say.

224
00:33:27,321 --> 00:33:37,733
Therefore we should have ideally 8 billion remedies for each one of the individuals

225
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:47,076
of this earth. Is this correct? No, what I say is logical.

226
00:33:47,276 --> 00:33:57,233
If we maintain that we treat on the individual basis and not on a massive basis,

227
00:33:57,433 --> 00:34:10,015
that means we find the individual remedy, the remedy that the organism needs,

228
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:22,689
so do we have so many remedies... Boericke Materia Medica has 870 remedies.

229
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:32,835
And some different people they have added and make it 2000-3000 remedies

230
00:34:33,035 --> 00:34:39,486
that we may say we have available. In practice we use 250 remedies

231
00:34:39,686 --> 00:34:51,010
with a probability of 1 in 10000 to go over these 250 remedies.

232
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:54,225
So what happens? Why people are cured?

233
00:34:56,213 --> 00:35:02,316
I put these questions myself but I don't know the answer.

234
00:35:11,459 --> 00:35:18,911
I left you with a problem. I understand.

235
00:35:19,111 --> 00:35:29,443
Paragraph 82, "Although, by the discovery of that great source of chronic diseases,

236
00:35:29,643 --> 00:35:37,504
as also by the discovery of the specific homoeopathic remedies for the psora,

237
00:35:37,704 --> 00:35:45,364
medicine has advanced some steps nearer to a knowledge of the nature of the

238
00:35:45,564 --> 00:35:54,500
majority of diseases it has to cure, yet, for settling the indication in each case of

239
00:35:54,700 --> 00:36:03,875
chronic (psoric) disease he is called on to cure, the duty of a careful apprehension

240
00:36:04,075 --> 00:36:11,000
of its ascertainable symptoms and characteristics..." I lost track.

241
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:19,944
It's beyond belief the train of thought. I have to read it three times before

242
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:30,127
I can follow it. "...is as indispensable for the homoeopathic physician as it was

243
00:36:30,327 --> 00:36:38,761
before that discovery, as no real cure of this or of other diseases can take place

244
00:36:38,961 --> 00:36:47,263
without a strict particular treatment (individualization) of each case of disease

245
00:36:47,463 --> 00:36:54,910
- only that in this investigation some difference is to be made when the affection is

246
00:36:55,110 --> 00:37:02,742
an acute and rapidly developed disease, and when it is a chronic one; seeing that,

247
00:37:02,942 --> 00:37:12,112
in acute disease, the chief symptoms strike us and become evident to the senses

248
00:37:12,312 --> 00:37:21,289
more quickly, and hence much less time is requisite for tracing the picture of the

249
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:27,669
disease and much fewer questions are required to be asked, as almost everything is

250
00:37:27,869 --> 00:37:34,792
self-evident, than in a chronic disease which has been gradually progressing for

251
00:37:34,992 --> 00:37:44,108
several years, in which the symptoms are much more difficult to be ascertained."

252
00:37:44,308 --> 00:37:59,220
In a few words he says that before the discovery of the psora things were different.

253
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:10,678
Now we have discovered the remedies that could affect the effects of psora.

254
00:38:10,878 --> 00:38:19,885
The effects of psora are of 2 types; one, acute diseases, mostly he means

255
00:38:20,085 --> 00:38:29,496
epidemics which have similar characteristics and (two) the chronic conditions

256
00:38:29,696 --> 00:38:34,997
which they do not have similar characteristics and they need more careful

257
00:38:35,197 --> 00:38:45,876
individualization. He says in acute diseases we have similar symptoms and maybe

258
00:38:46,076 --> 00:38:53,197
we can find 3-5 remedies that fit this acute.

259
00:38:53,397 --> 00:39:02,599
But in chronic we have to search much more because the difficulty is much greater

260
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:10,615
in finding out the individual symptom that each one has in chronic diseases.

261
00:39:14,217 --> 00:39:22,779
Paragraph 83, "This individualizing examination of a case of disease, for which

262
00:39:22,979 --> 00:39:29,829
I shall only give in this place general directions, of which the practitioner will bear

263
00:39:30,029 --> 00:39:37,883
in mind only what is applicable for each individual case, demands of the physician

264
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:48,708
nothing but freedom from prejudice and sound senses, attention in observing

265
00:39:48,908 --> 00:39:59,153
and fidelity in tracing the picture of the disease."

266
00:39:59,353 --> 00:40:05,548
He says in order to find the individual picture of the patient

267
00:40:05,748 --> 00:40:15,246
the first thing you have to have in mind is that you should not be prejudiced.

268
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:21,497
By prejudice he means that...

269
00:40:25,216 --> 00:40:36,228
A doctor knows that when you have a cough the lungs are suffering.

270
00:40:36,428 --> 00:40:44,357
So you have a cough, you have a bronchitis. That is a prejudice.

271
00:40:44,557 --> 00:40:53,458
That means because you know certain things, you project them and you do not

272
00:40:53,658 --> 00:41:01,397
observe objectively. You do not wait to see really what is going on with the patient

273
00:41:01,597 --> 00:41:10,049
in order to find out which are the individual characteristics of each case.

274
00:41:10,249 --> 00:41:22,137
You say Ok I know. The same thing we are doing projecting many times especially

275
00:41:22,337 --> 00:41:29,038
those who like the psychoanalysis of Homeopathy...

276
00:41:29,238 --> 00:41:38,550
You see Homeopathy allows you to psychoanalyze, project, say

277
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:47,686
I am sure this person had no fears but I am sure he has fears because

278
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:57,081
when I asked him if he has fears, he moved his head to the right.

279
00:41:57,281 --> 00:42:01,845
There are people who are doing this. This is a prejudice.

280
00:42:02,045 --> 00:42:09,224
This is not looking upon the facts in an unprejudiced manner and with good

281
00:42:12,225 --> 00:42:23,066
observation. "...freedom from prejudice and sound senses"

282
00:42:23,383 --> 00:42:25,755
that means you should be logical

283
00:42:26,272 --> 00:42:38,824
"attention in observing and fidelity in tracing the picture of the disease."

284
00:42:39,024 --> 00:42:45,244
Fidelity, that means you don't write down symptoms that the person does not have.

285
00:42:45,444 --> 00:42:48,901
Sometimes you want to make a picture of Calc. and you say...

286
00:42:49,101 --> 00:42:57,234
I remember some cases that were brought here with teachers from different

287
00:42:57,434 --> 00:43:07,410
places. There was a teacher from America and she had the case on the video and

288
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:16,134
she was investigating the case and she would say you have this symptom and

289
00:43:16,334 --> 00:43:31,009
the person would hesitate to answer. You have the symptom, don't you have it?!

290
00:43:31,209 --> 00:43:37,438
The person would say I think I have. That is very nice!

291
00:43:37,638 --> 00:43:46,664
You can do anything you like and then conclude that the remedy was Nat-p.

292
00:43:46,864 --> 00:43:51,673
Let's now see the follow up.

293
00:43:51,873 --> 00:44:00,759
She says you are better. I can see you are better.

294
00:44:00,959 --> 00:44:15,708
Maybe yes, I am better. You are better! Yes I am better. It's unbelievable.

295
00:44:15,908 --> 00:44:21,517
I said why do you have to ask so many times you are better?

296
00:44:21,717 --> 00:44:28,378
Let the patient say whether he is better or not. Maybe he wants to hide he is better.

297
00:44:28,578 --> 00:44:38,171
There are other ways you can find out if he tells you lies but if you push an idea to

298
00:44:38,371 --> 00:45:04,968
the patient, he is in a subordinate position... That means you are the authority and

299
00:45:05,168 --> 00:45:11,360
he does not know anything. So if you say, I am better that means the doctor knows

300
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:18,709
better, maybe I am better. And if you push this idea, you push everybody say

301
00:45:18,909 --> 00:45:40,376
I'm better... This is not fidelity and it is not sound senses and you are in the clouds.

302
00:45:43,898 --> 00:46:03,935
Par.84, "The patient details the history of his sufferings; those about him tell

303
00:46:04,135 --> 00:46:13,011
what they heard him complain of..."

304
00:46:13,211 --> 00:46:22,560
It is a part of investigation that we don't practice, calling the relatives of the person

305
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:33,829
and ask them to tell us how he behaves.

306
00:46:34,029 --> 00:46:40,319
It is something that Hahnemann had realized that it is an important part of

307
00:46:40,519 --> 00:46:55,083
case taking. I have a very recent example of a schizophrenic boy who was sent

308
00:46:55,283 --> 00:47:04,625
to me from Europe. His father is in a big position in Europe.

309
00:47:04,825 --> 00:47:10,590
With his mother and the boy. I talked with the boy, I took the case,

310
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:17,940
I talked to the mother, the mother gives me some information

311
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:27,122
and I say Ok I could not make out really the case, so I said most probably the remedy

312
00:47:27,322 --> 00:47:35,624
is this. I wrote back to his father who is a medical doctor.

313
00:47:35,824 --> 00:47:42,525
Not a homeopath, the opposite, does not believe in Homeopathy.

314
00:47:42,725 --> 00:47:52,556
But it does not matter. I wrote to him this is most probably the remedy.

315
00:47:52,756 --> 00:48:00,069
You take it in this way. But I would like to know if you can give me this, this and

316
00:48:00,269 --> 00:48:07,505
that information. He wrote me back and as soon as I read the information

317
00:48:07,705 --> 00:48:15,252
I sent an urgent message don't take the remedy, there is a mistake,

318
00:48:20,549 --> 00:48:23,378
I will give you another remedy. So it was very important.

319
00:48:23,578 --> 00:48:36,421
The mother, like all the mothers, brought a child who is totally autistic and they

320
00:48:36,621 --> 00:48:45,561
presented as if nothing is wrong with the child. The child is so good and

321
00:48:45,761 --> 00:48:52,466
he is never sick and he is so healthy.

322
00:48:54,867 --> 00:49:07,606
You need the details of the pathology. You cannot get it because the mother has

323
00:49:07,806 --> 00:49:13,153
this protective attitude and not to say a bad thing about the child.

324
00:49:13,353 --> 00:49:21,442
That the child who is 14 years old still soils his pants because he does not know to go

325
00:49:21,642 --> 00:49:24,542
to the toilet, for instance.

326
00:49:24,742 --> 00:49:32,910
They hide facts of that type. This mother did not tell me.

327
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:45,419
The father says this child several times he has attacked the mother, has hit badly

328
00:49:45,619 --> 00:49:51,306
the mother, he goes out in the streets, he fights and hits the people, he sees

329
00:49:51,506 --> 00:50:04,193
mirrors, he breaks them... All these was hidden by his mother.

330
00:50:04,393 --> 00:50:10,739
How could I prescribe? And the father fortunately, when I wrote to him

331
00:50:10,939 --> 00:50:20,033
I suspected Stram. but I prescribed Phos. I suspected maybe there is a possibility

332
00:50:20,233 --> 00:50:29,302
of a Stram. case. Then I asked the father specific questions.

333
00:50:29,502 --> 00:50:40,943
He says he is terrified from dogs. I said Ok forget Phos. take Stram.

334
00:50:41,143 --> 00:50:49,471
So Hahnemann knew the importance of taking information from relatives.

335
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:57,891
Here it's very difficult when a grown-up somebody comes... You cannot call

336
00:50:58,091 --> 00:51:02,888
the brother, the mother etc. to give you information, they cannot come

337
00:51:03,088 --> 00:51:11,863
from Mexico please come and tell me if your son is aggressive or irritable.

338
00:51:12,063 --> 00:51:22,824
It's not possible but the right thing is this. Call and get an impression.

339
00:51:23,024 --> 00:51:30,841
"...of how he has behaved and what they have noticed in him; the physician sees,

340
00:51:31,041 --> 00:51:46,874
hears, and remarks by his other senses what there is of an altered or unusual

341
00:51:47,074 --> 00:51:53,555
character about him."

342
00:51:58,101 --> 00:52:06,531
When a person gives his case and he gives his mental emotional symptoms,

343
00:52:06,731 --> 00:52:16,638
when you say describe me your character, very few people can be objective and

344
00:52:16,838 --> 00:52:20,046
give you objective symptoms.

345
00:52:20,246 --> 00:52:36,434
Then what you have to find out is what out of his normal character is now

346
00:52:36,634 --> 00:52:47,897
abnormally strong or on the contrary has been diminished.

347
00:52:48,097 --> 00:52:54,733
If he says I used to be perceiving things very fast but now my mind is dull,

348
00:52:54,933 --> 00:53:00,194
you have to take it into consideration.

349
00:53:00,394 --> 00:53:11,533
But if a dull person says I used to be dull but now - like the Verat. - my mind is active

350
00:53:11,733 --> 00:53:19,706
and thinking all the time... And this is what we consider as pathology

351
00:53:19,906 --> 00:53:27,296
on mental/ emotional level, what is gone out of the normal of a person.

352
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:32,819
But the normal of the person is not the same in everyone.

353
00:53:33,019 --> 00:53:41,688
Not everyone is irritable. There are people who are not irritable at all.

354
00:53:41,888 --> 00:53:49,877
But there are people who are angered with the least provocation.

355
00:53:50,077 --> 00:53:58,595
If you say you have been all your life like that, that means this is the character.

356
00:53:58,795 --> 00:54:10,946
But if he says after the 25th year I became intolerant, I cannot accept any kind of

357
00:54:11,146 --> 00:54:18,924
offense. If somebody offends me even a little bit, I close up and don't want to see

358
00:54:19,124 --> 00:54:29,342
him, I leave etc. This is beyond his normal. Then you take it into consideration.

359
00:54:29,646 --> 00:54:47,079
He says here if you understood "what there is of an altered or unusual character

360
00:54:47,279 --> 00:54:53,354
about him" that you have to write down.

361
00:54:57,307 --> 00:55:05,791
"...He writes down accurately all that the patient and his friends have told him in

362
00:55:05,991 --> 00:55:17,759
the very expressions used by them." This is also something very important.

363
00:55:17,959 --> 00:55:27,866
To use the same expression and have it written and then when you reexamine

364
00:55:28,066 --> 00:55:42,432
he will say an expression in the beginning of the taking of the case like...

365
00:55:42,632 --> 00:55:55,833
I'm terribly irritable. You reexamine now. How is your irritation? Still there.

366
00:55:56,033 --> 00:56:04,688
How much? You have written "terribly irritable person".

367
00:56:04,888 --> 00:56:13,548
You examine here and you see he is not that irritable. His expression is much different

368
00:56:13,748 --> 00:56:19,745
than when he said I am terribly irritable person. You have to take that into

369
00:56:19,945 --> 00:56:29,055
consideration. Sometimes you will be lead to wait on a remedy because of a remark

370
00:56:29,255 --> 00:56:35,100
of that type. Because the irritability is less, because the depression is less.

371
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:43,897
Though he says I still have the depression, a month after I've given Aurum, you still

372
00:56:44,097 --> 00:56:56,525
have the depression but how much? The patient does not want to misguide you.

373
00:56:56,725 --> 00:57:03,149
But he is eager to get rid of the problem as soon as possible.

374
00:57:03,349 --> 00:57:08,224
So he is eager to give him another remedy that will take away what he is suffering

375
00:57:08,424 --> 00:57:15,856
from. So he tries to persuade you to give him another remedy.

376
00:57:16,056 --> 00:57:23,332
If you do it, you lose the thread.

377
00:57:28,524 --> 00:57:37,549
"Keeping silence himself he allows them to say all they have to say, and refrains

378
00:57:37,749 --> 00:57:44,251
from interrupting them unless they wander off to other matters."

379
00:57:44,451 --> 00:57:51,860
He comes to such details. He says call a friend of his, ask him what do you think

380
00:57:52,060 --> 00:58:01,474
about your friend, how he behaves and the person starts saying how he sees

381
00:58:01,674 --> 00:58:11,313
his friend. He says if the patient tries to interfere you say shut up.

382
00:58:11,513 --> 00:58:20,145
Don't allow him to talk. Let the other person talk unless he wanders, instead of

383
00:58:20,345 --> 00:58:31,966
talking about his character, he goes to the football game we had with Germany

384
00:58:32,166 --> 00:58:39,442
and we lost and Germany won... What about your friend? He likes soccer, my friend

385
00:58:39,642 --> 00:58:47,344
likes football and now he is sad most probably because we lost from the Germans.

386
00:58:47,544 --> 00:58:54,704
No, wait a moment, stop him. Otherwise you let him talk without allowing

387
00:58:54,904 --> 00:59:01,076
the patient to interfere with the observations of the other person.

388
00:59:04,718 --> 00:59:08,283
That can only happen with Germans.

389
00:59:08,483 --> 00:59:16,930
With the Greeks it would be very difficult. Me? I am like this?

390
00:59:17,130 --> 00:59:23,843
Do you really believe that I am like that? I never thought that you have not

391
00:59:24,043 --> 00:59:35,442
understood me all the life we are friends! This kind of reaction is of no use.

392
00:59:35,642 --> 00:59:44,984
"The physician advises them at the beginning of the examination to speak slowly,

393
00:59:45,184 --> 00:59:51,212
in order that he may take down in writing the important parts of what the speakers

394
00:59:51,412 --> 01:00:00,120
say." He goes into such details that look ridiculous but actually in practice they are

395
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:15,525
very useful advices. Wait, because I have to write everything you say.

396
01:00:17,851 --> 01:00:24,940
"He begins a fresh line with every new circumstance mentioned by the patient or

397
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:35,094
his friends, so that the symptoms shall be all ranged separately one below the other.

398
01:00:35,294 --> 01:00:48,612
He can thus add to anyone, that may at first have been related in too vague

399
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:52,296
a manner, but subsequently more explicitly explained." It's unbelievable.

400
01:00:52,496 --> 01:00:58,192
He says write one symptom in a line so you have space to add more explanation

401
01:00:58,392 --> 01:01:05,358
in case there is later, they come back to the symptom and they explain.

402
01:01:05,558 --> 01:01:15,600
This kind of detailed person he was.

403
01:01:20,104 --> 01:01:30,775
Most probably he did not have the heavy load of patients that we have to deal with.

404
01:01:30,975 --> 01:01:39,918
There was a time when there were 10 doctors working and I had to go from one

405
01:01:40,118 --> 01:01:48,356
consulting room to another and in 3 minutes prescribe by 10, it makes half an hour

406
01:01:48,556 --> 01:01:55,057
when I start again. It was very difficult...

407
01:02:03,198 --> 01:02:08,779
-I have one question about aggravation.

408
01:02:08,979 --> 01:02:15,365
What is your experience, do you see aggravation in acute cases?

409
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:25,776
-That means you were not listening all this time...You have all the time this in your

410
01:02:25,976 --> 01:02:35,704
mind to ask of the acute case is aggravated or not...

411
01:02:35,904 --> 01:02:43,849
I shall give you the answer in order to peace your mind and attend the rest of

412
01:02:44,049 --> 01:02:59,845
the lecture. Say it again. You want to know the quality of the aggravation

413
01:03:00,045 --> 01:03:04,470
or whether there is any aggravation in the acute?

414
01:03:04,670 --> 01:03:11,287
-Because my experience is that sometimes when the acute is intense

415
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:16,980
there is no perceptible aggravation and the patient is...

416
01:03:31,665 --> 01:03:39,481
If we have a patient with very intense, acute complaints, for instance high fever

417
01:03:39,681 --> 01:03:46,489
or intense pains and we give a remedy, the patient goes immediately towards

418
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:55,290
amelioration. But sometimes when we have a case of something intense

419
01:03:55,490 --> 01:04:04,013
like colics in children, sometimes that is quick and very intense aggravation.

420
01:04:04,213 --> 01:04:10,365
My question is if you have the same experience in acute cases

421
01:04:10,565 --> 01:04:15,012
that there are some cases that is not perceptible aggravation.

422
01:04:15,212 --> 01:04:28,202
-That's correct. In some cases there is no perceptive aggravation... but what

423
01:04:28,402 --> 01:04:37,542
may happen is for instance in a case of influenza, where there is 39 C fever,

424
01:04:37,742 --> 01:04:42,693
there are pains, headaches etc. You give the remedy and you find out that for

425
01:04:42,893 --> 01:04:49,008
an hour the headache becomes much more, while at the same time

426
01:04:49,208 --> 01:04:54,724
the fever is dropping down. This is correct.

427
01:04:54,924 --> 01:05:07,145
In acute cases especially if you give the remedy at the peak of the acute disease,

428
01:05:07,345 --> 01:05:16,034
you will find no aggravation. If you give the remedy before the peak,

429
01:05:16,234 --> 01:05:20,100
you will see the patient will feel the aggravation.

430
01:05:25,919 --> 01:05:39,728
We can go to the next generation.

431
01:05:46,234 --> 01:05:58,278
Par. 86, "When the narrators have finished what they would say of their own accord,

432
01:05:58,478 --> 01:06:08,809
the physician then reverts to each particular symptom and elicits more precise

433
01:06:09,009 --> 01:06:18,961
information respecting it in the following manner; he reads over the symptoms

434
01:06:19,161 --> 01:06:27,139
as they were related to him one by one, and about each of them he inquires

435
01:06:27,339 --> 01:06:37,420
for further particulars, e.g., at what period did this symptom occur?"

436
01:06:41,722 --> 01:06:52,534
On this paragraph it is based what we try to do with the computer (Compass)...

437
01:06:52,734 --> 01:07:03,359
That means when you have some basic symptoms, you will be able to ask more details

438
01:07:03,743 --> 01:07:11,750
about that symptom. That means the program will give you the questions;

439
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:29,039
he has thirst, you notice "I'm thirsty" you go back and the system will give you

440
01:07:29,311 --> 01:07:35,535
5 questions concerning the thirst, is thirst for large quantity...?

441
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:47,886
He says you have the main symptoms, you go back and you tell you are thirsty.

442
01:07:48,766 --> 01:07:54,262
Are you thirsty for cold water? Are you thirsty for large quantities? Small quantities?

443
01:07:56,349 --> 01:08:05,176
The Compass will do exactly that. We are programming all the time improving this.

444
01:08:08,311 --> 01:08:18,216
"Was it previous to taking the medicine he had hitherto been using? While taking the

445
01:08:18,584 --> 01:08:29,424
medicine?...at what period did this symptom occur? Was it previous to taking the

446
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:38,728
medicine he had hitherto been using?" Because he had the problem to separate

447
01:08:40,224 --> 01:08:47,159
symptoms that belonged to the drugs the person he was taking already and

448
01:08:48,015 --> 01:08:52,319
his natural reaction of the disease.

449
01:08:53,120 --> 01:09:03,640
So whether the symptom he relates now was before the drug he was taking or it's

450
01:09:03,943 --> 01:09:11,343
after the drug? That means that symptom belongs to the drug and not the disease.

451
01:09:15,984 --> 01:09:24,776
"What kind of pain, what sensation exactly, was it that occurred on this spot?

452
01:09:25,271 --> 01:09:34,439
Where was the precise spot? Did the pain occur in fits and by itself, at various times?

453
01:09:35,503 --> 01:09:46,576
Or was it continued, without intermission? How long did it last? At what time of the

454
01:09:46,816 --> 01:09:56,647
day or night, and in what position of the body was it worst, or ceased entirely?

455
01:09:58,599 --> 01:10:04,679
What was the exact nature of this or that event or circumstance mentioned -

456
01:10:04,896 --> 01:10:15,560
described in plain words?" Hahnemann describes the real situation of the real

457
01:10:16,175 --> 01:10:21,591
circumstances in which he was living. And these were the circumstances.

458
01:10:23,096 --> 01:10:31,431
People were suffering mostly with physical diseases and he was trying to find

459
01:10:32,615 --> 01:10:40,703
the peculiarities in the modalities of the physical problems. That's why he insists so

460
01:10:40,888 --> 01:10:47,967
much in the physical symptoms and what are the details of such symptoms.

461
01:10:50,351 --> 01:10:57,735
Today that all the diseases have been pushed most to the mental/ emotional side

462
01:10:58,168 --> 01:11:04,647
we have to get information from that side as well, combine it with the physical

463
01:11:05,047 --> 01:11:12,159
symptoms. The work that we have to do is quite different now.

464
01:11:14,704 --> 01:11:24,464
First of all we have to study a different Materia Medica than Hahnemann was writing

465
01:11:27,311 --> 01:11:42,807
because that M.M. was only mental symptoms. Did not constitute a whole.

466
01:11:43,527 --> 01:11:51,119
So when Kent came he gave a whole picture. Like when he describes Puls., Nat-m.

467
01:11:52,384 --> 01:11:56,959
Later on when I came I gave more information about mental/ emotional

468
01:11:57,759 --> 01:12:04,399
symptomatology and then all crazy people added all crazy things.

469
01:12:05,864 --> 01:12:14,047
You can imagine if somebody uses his imagination instead of facts, what he can add

470
01:12:14,527 --> 01:12:22,543
in the M.M. He can add a whole lot.

471
01:12:26,216 --> 01:12:36,112
When I was teaching in America, I was telling if you continue with this idea of using

472
01:12:36,375 --> 01:12:43,511
imagination and not the real facts... What they were doing is...

473
01:12:44,888 --> 01:13:01,296
They got a case of Berberis and they talk with the person and the person has his own

474
01:13:01,504 --> 01:13:06,599
personality and gives the characteristics of his personality.

475
01:13:08,271 --> 01:13:16,199
They write them down and when they go to a seminar they say Berb. will be like this

476
01:13:17,504 --> 01:13:23,975
and they describe the patient who had a kidney problem and because there was a

477
01:13:24,143 --> 01:13:34,975
characteristic of the type of pain that goes around you gave Berb. and the pain went

478
01:13:35,184 --> 01:13:45,704
away. But this has nothing to do with the characteristics of the personality of the

479
01:13:45,847 --> 01:13:55,176
person who had said my personality is this or that and never changed.

480
01:13:55,416 --> 01:14:04,496
Because personality traits do not change. What changes is when I am a person,

481
01:14:05,711 --> 01:14:16,200
who is easily offended by nature, if this becomes extreme, then it is a problem.

482
01:14:16,607 --> 01:14:29,880
Then when I take a remedy this extreme sensitivity to offense goes down.

483
01:14:30,056 --> 01:14:36,143
Still I am easily offended. I don't say I am totally different.

484
01:14:38,183 --> 01:14:45,231
Unless he was totally indifferent before and he became very easily offended

485
01:14:45,744 --> 01:14:47,528
which can be also.

486
01:14:47,752 --> 01:14:56,944
But you have to realize that if you treat a case and you have written down

487
01:14:57,255 --> 01:15:05,622
all the characteristics of that person and then you go and present the characteristics

488
01:15:05,864 --> 01:15:12,567
of the person as the characteristics of the remedy, you can imagine what happens.

489
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:20,479
In 10 cases of Berb. that you will have 10 different personalities describing their

490
01:15:22,943 --> 01:15:30,047
personality without you realizing these are not symptoms but only characteristics

491
01:15:30,191 --> 01:15:39,576
of the personality and you go in a Congress or a Seminar and you give it out as

492
01:15:39,712 --> 01:15:45,815
information about the mental/emotional picture of Berb. and you describe

493
01:15:47,255 --> 01:15:53,575
the characteristic personality of the person who is healthy in that respect,

494
01:15:54,416 --> 01:16:00,359
he has no problem on the mental/ emotional level, he had only pain in the kidneys.

495
01:16:01,287 --> 01:16:08,967
If you do that you can understand what it is going to happen in the M.M.

496
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:16,511
It will be a total confusion, every M.M., every remedy will have all

497
01:16:16,679 --> 01:16:20,431
the symptoms existing in the earth.

498
01:16:31,184 --> 01:16:41,664
Paragraph 87, "And thus the physician obtains more precise information

499
01:16:43,263 --> 01:16:53,480
respecting each particular detail, but without ever framing his questions so as to

500
01:16:53,679 --> 01:17:04,432
suggest the answer to the patient..." You have this. If you say to the patient

501
01:17:04,592 --> 01:17:09,528
you have this, the patient will say most of the times, yes I have this.

502
01:17:11,271 --> 01:17:24,040
The best thing is ask; are you thirsty or not? You give a chance to tell you the truth.

503
01:17:24,216 --> 01:17:32,231
"...so that he shall only have to answer yes or no; else he will be misled to answer in

504
01:17:33,928 --> 01:17:44,951
the affirmative or negative something untrue, half true, or not strictly correct,

505
01:17:45,551 --> 01:17:52,375
either from indolence or in order to please his interrogator".

506
01:17:54,712 --> 01:18:03,439
Some people give an answer. No, I did not ask you, suppose that you are thirsty

507
01:18:03,712 --> 01:18:11,368
say, yes I am thirsty. Are you thirsty? Yes, I am thirty. And you see the eagerness

508
01:18:12,031 --> 01:18:19,687
yes, I am thirsty. You see this does not sound correct.

509
01:18:20,439 --> 01:18:30,088
How many glasses do you drink? I drink 3-4 glasses a day. This is no thirsty.

510
01:18:33,536 --> 01:18:43,752
But he thought if he gives you this information in a positive manner, it will help you to

511
01:18:43,951 --> 01:18:51,487
find the remedy but actually it does not help you, sidetracks you to lose the remedy.

512
01:19:05,288 --> 01:19:12,143
"...from which a false picture of the disease and an unsuitable mode of treatment

513
01:19:13,455 --> 01:19:18,375
must result."

514
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:46,320
This kind of interrogation is really thorough but on the other hand

515
01:19:47,663 --> 01:19:58,816
if you go and follow it in a very typical manner, I will tell you what happens

516
01:19:59,392 --> 01:20:03,448
because I have the experience with all the doctors working with me.

517
01:20:04,271 --> 01:20:11,799
In the Centre we had some doctors, we specified 1 hour for taking the case.

518
01:20:13,951 --> 01:20:20,928
2 of them they specified 3 hours for a case. They said to the secretary for me

519
01:20:21,288 --> 01:20:27,823
when you arrange a new case give me 3 hours. So they wrote everything.

520
01:20:29,071 --> 01:20:34,463
I went to read the case to prescribe. Because I had to read the case and prescribe.

521
01:20:35,552 --> 01:20:40,431
I almost invariably did not know what the remedy is.

522
01:20:41,495 --> 01:20:48,703
While others they have understood that the most peculiar are the things

523
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:58,839
which are concerning us and guiding us and had underlined the peculiarities of

524
01:20:58,991 --> 01:21:07,848
the case and I go and I see the underlines, I just have an overview and write

525
01:21:07,984 --> 01:21:14,423
the remedy. The other one, I tried hard, many times the remedy was wrong.

526
01:21:16,071 --> 01:21:27,808
Yet it was a typical, exact, detailed case taking. So you have to combine.

527
01:21:28,024 --> 01:21:38,840
Later on in paragraph 153, he will explain the importance of keynotes.

528
01:21:40,063 --> 01:21:45,575
So we are looking for keynotes together with the overall picture.

529
01:21:50,343 --> 01:21:57,759
There is another problem. Today we see cases with a lot of layers.

530
01:22:00,743 --> 01:22:08,574
That means each layer underlying pops up one of its symptoms.

531
01:22:09,399 --> 01:22:16,111
So you may have the main layer uppermost but popping up few symptoms of

532
01:22:16,231 --> 01:22:23,463
the underlying layers and we have a big problem because the cases that we see

533
01:22:24,647 --> 01:22:31,847
are such that have deep pathology on a mental/ emotional level.

534
01:22:35,095 --> 01:22:43,607
So if you start writing down everything, not realizing then all the different layers

535
01:22:44,855 --> 01:22:51,359
become one report without differentiating.

536
01:22:53,143 --> 01:23:00,302
You don't have the impression that now this symptom is important and

537
01:23:00,463 --> 01:23:08,991
I have to write it down and I have to take notice of that symptom.
