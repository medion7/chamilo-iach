1
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:31,640
So, this is the model and what we can say is that this people here they can live up to 90 year.

2
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,410
If everything goes well, if they don't damage their health,

3
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:48,990
they're born with good genetic predisposition and their programming is to live more than 80 years.

4
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:09,970
In this group people will get a common cold or influenza once in a year,

5
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:15,140
once in two years or even once in three years.

6
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:26,400
Actually people with very good health they may not become ill for many years.

7
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:38,140
People who live in mountainous areas, who are farmers, you ask them

8
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,740
and they say "I have never been sick".

9
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:59,410
The acutes in this is very rare. As they come down they can have more acutes.

10
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:09,570
Now when they go here on this second group the acutes start to be twice a year

11
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:24,320
or three times a year they may have an acute. And here on level 6 we see very frequent acutes.

12
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:40,060
Even children who are having almost every month a cystitis and they get antibiotics

13
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:48,480
and finally the mother says all the year I have to give antibiotics to the child.

14
00:02:48,580 --> 00:03:01,900
Or otitis repeated again and again, repeated bronchitis, all kinds of acute situations.

15
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:13,160
Now, what happens usually is that the pediatricians or the doctors who are treating such cases

16
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:20,910
they give antibiotics and at a certain time the child is well.

17
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:29,160
He does not have any more acutes. This a very dangerous situation,

18
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:35,650
would mean the child has gone on level 7.

19
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:43,090
He went down and now his immune system cannot produce any more acutes.

20
00:03:44,840 --> 00:04:03,730
This can happen in early life like when somebody is 10-11 years old where acutes stop

21
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:08,680
and they are not sick with an acute.

22
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:36,400
If such people by good homeopathy are treated while on 7 or 8- rather on 7 I would say-

23
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:44,890
the first thing that happens it will be after the remedy a month later,

24
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:54,580
20 days later even a few days after correct remedy they start again developing fever.

25
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:07,230
So, that's why we say that if we give a remedy and the person develops a fever

26
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:13,980
immediately after the remedy that is a good sign and it means

27
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:23,580
that the person jumped from level 7 back to 6 or 5.

28
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:36,180
If the person is in these levels or even very down here

29
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:48,690
then it will take long time before you can raise him to this level 6 where he can have again fever.

30
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:57,270
You may treat 2-3 years a person before he shows that he can develop fever.

31
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:14,250
It's very interesting. It does not depend on the age. A person may be old but strong organism.

32
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,930
He can develop fever.

33
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:32,190
A person maybe a young person but his organism is very weak he cannot develop fever.

34
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:49,600
In level 6 the person gets easily acutes. Repeated acutes. They are the cases who never recover.

35
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:58,450
He has a bronchitis and then after two months again another and then after three months again.

36
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:09,450
So, in this level we have acutes which are frequent- levels 5 and 6 - .

37
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:16,340
At a certain moment the acutes stop, has been level 7.

38
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:26,920
Level 7 is not a bad state yet because it may be that with one remedy

39
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:34,860
that you give here fever appears again. That's very good level 7.

40
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:43,090
If you see that you give a correct remedy and fever does not appear

41
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:53,230
it means that the person will be either 8 or 9 and will need a series of remedies

42
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:57,930
before he can come back.

43
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:12,700
When he comes back from 8 or 9 position to 6 he is going to have a very severe acute

44
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:25,090
and many times life-threatening. And this is the time

45
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:33,510
where you have to be an expert to treat the acute homeopathically.

46
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:44,260
Because if you treat the acute with antibiotics or cortisone things will sink again back

47
00:08:44,360 --> 00:09:00,740
to the lower level which shows that in the most of the cases antibiotics suppress the disease

48
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:15,930
towards a deeper level. Here people can start with being quite strong but they take wrong treatment,

49
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:20,490
they take antibiotics they come down.

50
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:31,720
The more antibiotics the more the health goes down. And they can sink very much down

51
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,070
and reach these levels.

52
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:52,590
As I said in these levels you can have any pathology.

53
00:09:53,080 --> 00:10:03,230
That means the fact that the person has Parkinson it does not mean

54
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:10,970
that the pathology will be down here necessarily it can be here

55
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:20,000
which means that the person with Parkinson that from time to time he's able to raise a fever.

56
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:28,310
That Parkinson disease is curable with homeopathy.

57
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:36,820
You see how important it is to know this? Can your system raise fever?

58
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:43,810
That means is your immune system is in good condition then we stimulate it

59
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,510
and we may cure you.

60
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,950
All these things of course are very useful for homeopath

61
00:10:54,050 --> 00:11:01,380
but even for non-homeopaths are very useful as well.

62
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:10,790
All doctors actually should understand this model because they must know what they do

63
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:18,790
when they prescribe chemical drugs, the damage they can bring about.

64
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:35,450
It's very interesting that in one congress here,

65
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:47,050
International Congress of Neurology they invited me to speak about the model and they had a fit.

66
00:11:50,300 --> 00:12:01,870
Conventional doctors neurologists about 900 of them were in Hilton hotel

67
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:16,470
and I presented this model and I told them and none had any opposition.

68
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:25,950
So, there are quite a lot of other details about this model.

69
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:35,530
The problem is that within a week it's not that everything you learn

70
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:43,340
it is quite a difficult subject, homeopathy.

71
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:53,330
It's not learned in weekends and you have to apply yourself but once you learn it

72
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:58,440
it's very satisfying in the effects that it gives.

73
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:16,840
That when I am saying high fever I mean from 38,5 C and upwards. This type of fever.

74
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:31,080
Fever between 37C, 37,3C, 37,8C and malaise it shows an immune system which is weak.

75
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,110
Cannot give real fever.

76
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:45,680
This type of fever is the one that determines whether an immune system is in good condition.

77
00:13:46,520 --> 00:14:11,410
Yet, there is one exception that when an organism is on the brink of dying,

78
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:24,240
destroyed when somebody is in the hospital lying down there with a lot of problems,

79
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:33,570
in a very bad condition and you see a high fever arising is not a good sign is not a good fever.

80
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:40,910
This fever is going to be the last it is the last effort of the organism

81
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:50,760
and usually what they do they give antibiotics and the person lives 2-3 days and then he dies.

82
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:59,160
-You're talking about the first groups which can be cured.

83
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:04,080
What can we do with homeopathy in the lower groups?

84
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:16,920
-Usually what we can do is up to here. From here downwards we can ameliorate the situation.

85
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:28,500
We can make them feel more comfortable but really curing them it's very difficult,

86
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,250
if not impossible.

87
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:43,250
You may think a case is 10 or 11 but actually is in level 9 because things are not precise.

88
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:54,670
This can happen. But here the reaction from the homeopathic remedy is totally different.

89
00:15:54,770 --> 00:16:02,100
We'll speak another day about the reactions from the homeopathic remedy.

90
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:06,750
Reactions of the homeopathic remedy in different groups.

91
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:13,590
We'll take one by one groups and I will explain the possible reaction.

92
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:32,330
-If the people doesn't have fever for several years but doesn't have any illness...?

93
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:44,010
-It becomes to the first group. No fever, can be healthy, 1st level.

94
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:58,290
-It's about suppression how the level in this chart if it's the wrong remedy in homeopathy

95
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:03,970
and suppressed by allopathy how is the...?

96
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:27,140
-What happens is this, I will explain it to you. That's one level, not group. Level 4, ok?

97
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:38,980
A person can be on the top of this level with some symptoms, all these are symptoms

98
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:49,140
and when there is an acute or a suppression of whatever remains in the same level

99
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,580
but in the bottom of the level with different symptoms.

100
00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:02,490
So actually the homeopathic remedy will bring a person from the higher part of his level

101
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:20,750
to the lower part but cannot make him jump a level. A treatment with real chemical drugs

102
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:28,330
can push the person down to level 5 or 6.

103
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:36,310
But the homeopathic remedy can suppress but within the same level.

104
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:44,560
I want to give you the reactions after the homeopathic remedy of people

105
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:51,050
of the different levels and what kind of reaction we expect

106
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:56,410
and what potency is the best advisable.

107
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:16,150
For the level 1 people you can give any potency preferably very high potency

108
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:22,500
because they have clear pictures and they have strong organisms.

109
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:33,310
In level 1 people you may not expect an aggravation.

110
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:37,980
Usually we say you have an aggravation after we give a remedy.

111
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:49,230
When an organism is quite strong and he comes to you to be treated usually will be for lumbago

112
00:19:49,330 --> 00:20:00,910
or sciatica for a common cold, for little and peripheral problems.

113
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:09,080
Therefore you may not expect to have an aggravation with such cases.

114
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:18,170
Potency very high, no aggravation.

115
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:32,580
As you go down to the scale the pathology becomes deeper and deeper.

116
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:44,680
So in level 2 or 3 it will depend on the pathology you may have some reaction, you may not have.

117
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:53,330
This is another confusion which is within our community.

118
00:20:53,430 --> 00:21:09,080
Some teachers they say there are no aggravations and my response to this

119
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:16,700
is "Have you ever seen a real cure in a serious condition?".

120
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:27,690
Most probably they treat people on this level, easy cases, they give a remedy and it's finished.

121
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:35,710
All the other cases they treat they go away they don't know what's happening.

122
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:46,000
So, either they treat such people or they treat only with placebo.

123
00:21:46,460 --> 00:22:00,330
Placebo effect you do not see an aggravation. So either very healthy people or placebo.

124
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:05,240
If some teachers say they have never seen an aggravation

125
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:19,430
that means they have never cured a real case coming down the scale. They don't care.

126
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:38,240
The other thing that you have to have in mind is that when you give a remedy

127
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,070
it does not mean it does nothing.

128
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:53,820
In the example case that we saw, the Mancinella case,

129
00:22:53,920 --> 00:23:03,990
he was having babbling sensation in cervical region, he took Lycopodium, it was gone.

130
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:13,250
He was having twitchings in the face he took Nux vomica, twitching was gone.

131
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:19,990
So therefore it is not that our remedy would do nothing if they are wrong.

132
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:25,980
They will something and sometimes they also do damage.

133
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:37,820
As I said there may be suppressing a case within the same level and bring the person down.

134
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:45,900
Because when I say in general dropping of the general state of health

135
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:57,910
it means general that means energy-wise, less energy, more depression, more anxiety

136
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:14,260
and perhaps less pain in this specific area in which you are treating. That is a suppression.

137
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:21,940
You have a spastic colitis and I have said many times give me any symptom

138
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:32,700
and I will make it disappear because if I give all the remedies fitting that particular symptom

139
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:39,770
the symptom will disappear. What happens to the general state of the patient this is another story.

140
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:49,830
You see how important it is to know what you are doing.

141
00:24:51,580 --> 00:25:09,980
And here I'm trying to give you as much information as possible to discern, to find out

142
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:18,700
what is the result of your treatment. So if you do not see reactions here it's ok.

143
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:26,890
But if you come here in these groups where the organism is already compromised,

144
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:39,650
the immune system is in a low state of condition and you are taking such a case from this

145
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:51,320
and within this group you will find from mild to strong aggravations.

146
00:25:55,590 --> 00:26:07,970
As you go down, you are treating headaches of the 5th level

147
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:23,910
that means the person still has good immune system to have some high fevers.

148
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:39,240
So level 5 headaches are quite strong headaches and quite frequent., once a week.

149
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:51,210
You give them the remedy and the correct of the remedy is to hear the patient say

150
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:56,300
"I had the worst headache of my life".

151
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:14,360
When you hear that, they call, you know what you are doing and they hear your voice being secure

152
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:25,860
that you know what you are doing and you say "Very good, it is a good reaction!

153
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:33,450
In one or two days you will be free from the headaches

154
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:50,640
-Is that so? Ok." Otherwise they take painkillers.

155
00:27:53,500 --> 00:28:02,240
You know the idea this now after the remedy they gave me this "magician"

156
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:09,980
because sometimes they look the homeopath as a kind of a magician he's not a regular doctor

157
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,910
though he has studied regular medicine he says this is a magician

158
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:19,170
I went to the magician he gave me this and now I'm worse.

159
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:25,070
The patient will think that I went to the wrong doctor.

160
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:38,570
If that psychology remains and in your voice the patient will hear the least fear

161
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:45,810
"Oh my God what happened", you're finished.

162
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:53,320
The patient will go to the hospital will take painkillers, will take everything.

163
00:28:53,420 --> 00:29:11,480
Once in the 1970s as a student I had a professor of medicine and he was just starting

164
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:17,690
and he was asking me for every case. For every case he would call me.

165
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:33,410
One time he tells me "I have the child of the ambassador of France"

166
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:38,400
because he was speaking French "He has asthma..."

167
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:46,250
I said "Ok give him Sulphur" he says "I cannot give him Sulphur".

168
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:53,500
I asked why he said because the French doctors when he was in Paris

169
00:29:53,600 --> 00:30:01,740
they told him never touch Sulphur because if you touch Sulphur

170
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,090
the child is going to have such an aggravation.

171
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:12,740
Somebody gave him Sulphur the child had an aggravation, they couldn't wait for 2 days

172
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:20,790
and then they gave him all kinds of remedies. What remedies have been given?

173
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:23,890
He says half of the Materia Medica.

174
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:31,120
You know also the French doctors give specialties with mixed remedies.

175
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:37,870
I said to him this was the best reaction and the child would have been cured 5 years ago

176
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:44,870
when they gave him Sulphur but they did not know what they were doing.

177
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:53,870
And now 5 years the child is with severe asthmatic condition much more difficult to cure now

178
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:58,620
and the reaction was going to be much more difficult so I said to him

179
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:08,700
if you like give him a low potency repeatedly but you expect to have similar

180
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:13,800
or even worse aggravation. There is no other way.

181
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:21,290
The moment that you don't know what you are doing of course what do you want,

182
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:35,640
to make the asthma a little bit better give all kinds of similar remedies, not the Similimum,

183
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:45,880
not the exact and the asthma will be a little bit better and the child will be a little bit better.

184
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:53,880
But the child will never be cured. But I have to tell you also this;

185
00:31:53,980 --> 00:32:05,630
that this a little bit better in a case of asthma it means that the disturbance

186
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:16,380
which is concentrated upon the lungs is going now to be diffused at the whole of the organism.

187
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:31,790
So therefore as much as the asthma is better the same amount will be worse the energy, the anxiety,

188
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:36,630
the depression or whatever is diffused in the whole organism

189
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:45,220
because the organism is one there are no parts.

190
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:55,590
It works as a totality so you stimulate and the stimulation is not correct,

191
00:32:55,690 --> 00:33:04,800
is not towards cure but towards suppression.  Suppression is not an abstract idea.

192
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:12,460
For the organism suppression means that the relief you get from the local symptom

193
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:22,960
appears as a negative reaction on different other points of the organism

194
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:28,300
to which the person is sensitive.

195
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:45,540
-Asthma is a deadly disease, right? But a child can die from an aggravation.

196
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:50,480
So is it ok than to use allopathic methods during the aggravation?

197
00:33:50,610 --> 00:34:02,030
-Of course.  You won't let the child die, you will use. You were here, I think,

198
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:10,860
when I explained how to handle asthma cases. You were not here? You were here?

199
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:28,840
In the previous course I gave a lecture explaining how you handle difficult cases

200
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:49,030
under allopathic treatment. If you are late you see what happens.

201
00:34:52,020 --> 00:35:01,730
I sympathize with her because when I was in Canada I could not sleep at all.

202
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:08,470
So I was going to lecture half-asleep because I wanted to sleep during the time I was lecturing.

203
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:18,540
So you can sit there and listen when your biological watch is upside down.

204
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,630
You should be sleeping during this time.

205
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:30,890
So, it's ok, I will give you because this lecture is important

206
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:38,070
so I will ask Dimitri to put the lecture so l can sleep a little bit more.

207
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:57,720
Here up to here the reaction has no danger.

208
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:13,650
That means the reactions are such that cannot overcome the life force and make a total disaster.

209
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:37,530
But once the  organism has entered a real degenerative state which is not a pathology

210
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:40,970
which has been diagnosed as such,

211
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:57,720
autoimmune, LPE, RA is not a pathology per se as we know it from conventional medicine

212
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:12,050
that makes a person come to level 7 because in level 7 it can enter a person

213
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:19,240
who just manifests an aggressive high blood pressure.

214
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:33,320
You get some people who feel good but they have an aggressive high blood pressure.

215
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:44,470
It means that they take medication and the pressure is still high in spite of medication.

216
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:49,880
You think what is this? This high blood pressure is nothing.

217
00:37:49,980 --> 00:38:00,570
This kind of blood pressure makes a person enter the level 7 or 8.

218
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:12,220
That means that this person from the moment his blood pressure became malignant

219
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:22,230
has stopped giving high fevers, cannot give anymore high fevers.

220
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:38,150
When you prescribe for level 7 if your remedy is correct

221
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:51,940
and if the pathology is not really very deep you are going to have an aggravation immediately

222
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,960
and what else?

223
00:38:55,710 --> 00:39:03,550
You are going to have very soon after you prescription manifesting high fever.

224
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,290
That will show you your prescription was correct.

225
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:16,950
It is not correct your prescription when he says my blood was up to 21, 22

226
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:22,280
and did not go down and now with the remedy you gave Lachesis, you gave Belladonna,

227
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:34,860
you gave all the anti-hypertensive remedies that we know and now the blood pressure is 18

228
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:41,530
and says "I'm better". You know that you have done nothing.

229
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:49,200
As an homeopath you realize that the remedy was wrong. But the patient is happy.

230
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:54,940
From 21-22 the blood pressure now is 18, under 20

231
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:07,390
but you know the remedy was only close, not exact.

232
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:20,300
For him to have better state of health he has to have an aggravation

233
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,890
and he has to manifest also fever.

234
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:49,050
I'll tell you some examples. I was treating 10 years ago a case

235
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:56,150
with cancer of the head of the pancreas with metastasis.

236
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:14,540
He gave a lot of aggravations in the beginning of the treatment for a year he was terrible

237
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:21,540
the laboratory test was crazy the condition was absolutely dangerous.

238
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:31,790
He had been operated, opened and closed. They said you go and you will live a few more months.

239
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:39,100
That was the prognosis. And of course he did not have any other chance

240
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:54,620
so he had to withstand all the aggravations. The man is still alive. 10 or 12 years already.

241
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:12,530
The laboratory tests are normal but I still wait to see the high fever.

242
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:25,180
As long as I don't see the high fever that means I took that man from that level 11

243
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:35,170
and brought it maybe at the 8th level or 7th level where he feels ok.

244
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:40,790
I'm ok now, I'm working, I have a normal life.

245
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:49,700
But if I don't see the high fever I'm not sure that under stress his organism

246
00:42:49,800 --> 00:43:02,270
will suddenly go down and explode the cancer which is lurking there.

247
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:10,930
Once I see the fever I say ok you're over there, you're finished with the cancer.

248
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:20,010
Not when the cancer markers are good, it's ok, it's an indication.

249
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:29,370
You know there are cancer markers for different kinds of cancer.

250
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:52,340
I'll tell you another story, just a similar story, ok?

251
00:43:52,440 --> 00:44:03,430
Cancer of the breast in a woman, for 10 years trying to cure.

252
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:09,180
Finally she was going back to London, checked, markers ok, everything's ok,

253
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,680
cancer is gone, finished.

254
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:32,350
You're well now. And there comes one time and things happen all together.

255
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:47,190
She separates with her husband, in the meantime she was in love with another man all along.

256
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:59,350
The man says to her I have to stop the relationship I'm not prepared to separate and go ahead.

257
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:12,200
Another shock, a big shock. She was connected with a kind of spiritual teacher.

258
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:24,020
She discovers the spiritual teacher is a fake. It all happens in June, July, August.

259
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:32,020
In September what was thought to be gone

260
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:42,280
the cancer explodes with a total spread in the organism.

261
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:49,180
I was in America by that time and she was my patient.

262
00:45:49,280 --> 00:46:01,930
There was one of my students looking her, and he said let's phone George.

263
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:33,780
She said you must swear to me that you will not phone. That she had decided to leave.

264
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,930
The problem was I was watching all the time for the high fever

265
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:51,610
and there was no coming for 10 years treating carefully.

266
00:46:52,610 --> 00:47:00,020
The organism looks perfectly healthy but the stress was so much,

267
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:09,770
one stress after another, big stress, big stress, gone the organism finished.

268
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:16,950
After two months she dies. She lasted only 2 months.

269
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:28,710
What I'm saying to you is not a theory, it's the real facts.

270
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:48,260
You treat here there must be an aggravation, you treat number 8 it must be an aggravation,

271
00:47:48,360 --> 00:48:03,120
you treat number 9 you may not get an aggravation anymore but an amelioration.

272
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:13,260
That means number 9 patient is in the brink of being incurable.

273
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:26,850
It is in the middle line, that means the organism improves, he feels improvement,

274
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:40,350
but if this improvement does not lead to a more clear remedy

275
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:49,120
this improvement is going to be a little bit of improvement.

276
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:58,030
It has to lead to a more clear remedy in order to understand that from number 9

277
00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:04,190
is going towards number 8 with a better picture.

278
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:12,760
Because here the picture is very clear, the remedy is very clear.

279
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:18,440
The remedy number 3 is becoming less clear.

280
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:26,940
As you go down the first remedy which you need is less clear,

281
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:35,220
because in these levels you need 2 or 3 remedies to cure.

282
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:57,690
These are big, strong symptoms, these are smaller and smaller symptoms.

283
00:49:57,790 --> 00:50:04,540
All these are modifications of symptoms.

284
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:13,970
This organism has been through a lot of stress because of this lot of stress,

285
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:24,380
this graph shows Ignatia picture.

286
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:36,220
But when this person is on this level 8 or 9 or even 7 underneath Ignatia

287
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:42,320
there are a few more symptoms like Natrum muriaticum.

288
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:56,470
Nat-m as you examine is not like this underneath, so clear Ign, clear Nat-m.

289
00:50:56,570 --> 00:51:13,340
What happens is that as you examine you will see symptoms of Nat-m popping up in the face.

290
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:29,470
If further you will need Sepia or Sulphur you may get a symptom of Sepia as well,

291
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:38,220
or another symptom of Sepia. See, can you recognize now Ignatia here? Very difficult.

292
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:46,820
Because of some symptoms Nat-m there what shall I give, this remedy, that remedy...?

293
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:56,050
The moment the organism is compromised more and more, more and more levels of remedies

294
00:51:56,150 --> 00:52:07,660
you will need which are there, underneath, popping up in the uppermost level.

295
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:28,060
And you have to be experienced and also very logical in your analysis to be able to separate

296
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:37,720
which is the first. Because if you give this remedy as first what you are doing,

297
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:43,640
you are pushing all these over the high picture.

298
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:50,140
Already from a confused case or a difficult case you make it more confused

299
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:55,140
and then it comes Sepia and you give Sepia and you ignore

300
00:52:55,240 --> 00:53:00,220
that the first remedy should have been Ignatia never mind how many remedies,

301
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:05,720
half of the Materia Medica you have given the patient is not going to be well

302
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:12,220
unless you give the original, Ignatia.

303
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:18,990
But now after all these remedies you have given the Ignatia picture is gone.

304
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:31,660
Who is going to find out? Not even a master, or a very experienced homeopath.

305
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:43,560
So you have to understand that homeopathy in this respect otherwise you will treat group 1,

306
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:56,890
be happy with some successes 10-15%, here how many people today,

307
00:53:56,990 --> 00:54:04,900
maybe in your countries in south America you have much more on level 1 people.

308
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:16,390
Here in Europe and America and Canada the percentage of these people is the 5% the most,

309
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:21,140
5% of people have remained strong.

310
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:28,990
In South America this group is 50% of the population.

311
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:35,890
So you have good successes with little knowledge.

312
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:43,720
If you know  some remedies well you will be treating more of the people successfully,

313
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:46,220
your success will be quite big.

314
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:57,050
In Europe you have to be really an expert because we are degenerated.

315
00:54:57,150 --> 00:55:02,910
We are going towards extinction.

316
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:36,320
Here in number 6 or number 5 the organism is ready to be infected

317
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:52,300
and very easily with a lot of agents like bacteria, like microbes, like all kinds of viruses.

318
00:55:52,400 --> 00:56:10,910
This group is proned to get everything. Therefore if they do not get treated they will die.

319
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:23,900
A huge part of the population of these levels there would be dead unless we had strong drugs

320
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:46,400
like antibiotics, cortisone etc. But they were well with the different epidemics with Tamiflu

321
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:54,720
and whatever else antiviral or antibiotics etc.

322
00:56:56,139 --> 00:57:10,032
People are getting to life, to stay alive but they are paying the price. And what is the price they are paying?

323
00:57:11,773 --> 00:57:21,293
The price is that after the Antibiotics they drop to these levels.

324
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:38,807
These levels they allow you to stay alive but with a life which is compromised. In what respect?

325
00:57:39,151 --> 00:57:55,966
First of all joy of life is gone. You loose the joy of life, you loose the pleasure of life

326
00:57:57,224 --> 00:58:05,496
where you were waking up in the morning and were very happy to be in this nice world.

327
00:58:05,893 --> 00:58:14,765
Now you get up in the morning in a depressed stadt, gloomy state. I have not slept well bla bla bla.

328
00:58:15,346 --> 00:58:32,258
You are alive -- that is good. But what are we doing through these means that we have found out to keep an organism alive?

329
00:58:32,546 --> 00:58:48,378
Even in this 12 we have found means to keep people alive. You have a machine that makes you breath.

330
00:58:49,989 --> 00:58:58,454
There is another machine for dialysis were your blood is going through. And there is another machine for the heart which keeps your heart...

331
00:58:58,809 --> 00:59:12,521
And you are in a hospital you have a lot of money and the doctors they feel proud to put all this machinery keep you alive for how long?

332
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:16,502
For six month, for a year, for a year and a half. I don't know.

333
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:25,490
The patient themselves most probably on that stage they say "please let me die".

334
00:59:25,590 --> 00:59:32,010
Because they are living hell in earth, before their time.

335
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:44,740
But in these levels we have ways to live and that's why the big issue is euthanasia.

336
00:59:47,170 --> 00:59:49,440
You know euthanasia?

337
00:59:52,440 --> 01:00:02,190
And they're debating, should we let these people on these levels die or should we keep them?

338
01:00:02,930 --> 01:00:09,830
It's a big issue now. Who has created that issue? Conventional medicine.

339
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:20,090
Because by keeping alive organisms that they should have died normally at the 6th level

340
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:29,070
you keep them alive but in a compromised state. It's a new theory.

341
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:41,000
I don't know the solution, right? Because I cannot say take out all chemical drugs or antibiotics

342
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:49,490
and let people die normally and in a natural way. I cannot say that.

343
01:00:49,590 --> 01:01:00,580
But I record the facts. The way I understand the facts. Unfortunately,

344
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:09,320
what I record is the experience of somebody that has seen 200.000 cases in 50 years

345
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:12,420
of practicing homeopathy.

346
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:26,400
Don't forget I had a big center with 30 medical doctors

347
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:34,140
and I was supervising there all these doctors and prescribing for cases.

348
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:43,150
The information, the subjects are big.

349
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:53,150
These results came from a study of a huge number of patients. And from different countries.

350
01:01:53,250 --> 01:02:01,650
Because I was treating people in America, in Europe, in India, from every country.

351
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:05,340
So I know what has happened.

352
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:20,230
The most healthy people are, the areas; South America, you are one of the most healthy,

353
01:02:20,330 --> 01:02:39,150
I don't know how many they accept that, Africa, Asia, Korea. These are the most healthy people.

354
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:51,240
The most unhealthy where do we find almost every one of these levels in Europe, in America,

355
01:02:51,340 --> 01:03:10,900
in Australia and all the civilized countries. Canada. These are the facts.

356
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:19,640
Try to cure a patient here and you see how difficult it is.

357
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:24,250
This kind of difficulty you will find every time.

358
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:35,740
Because when it comes to this point and you give a remedy you will never see and aggravation.

359
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:41,850
Number 10, you will never see an aggravation. You will see amelioration.

360
01:03:41,950 --> 01:03:51,640
That means the organism is already compromised and says ok you don't allow me to have this pain

361
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:54,750
I will have the pain somewhere else.

362
01:03:55,490 --> 01:04:05,620
That means you will be treating here cases with cancer with metastasis

363
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:15,860
where the pains are excruciating, with metastasis, in the bone especially

364
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:27,810
and you will be relieving the pains but a strange thing will happen

365
01:04:27,910 --> 01:04:34,170
that the organism does not stay in one remedy.

366
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:43,570
That means every week you will visit such people with metastasis you will see a new picture

367
01:04:43,670 --> 01:04:49,320
and a new remedy is needed in order to relieve it again for another week

368
01:04:49,420 --> 01:05:03,170
and another week until finally death comes. There is amelioration.

369
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:11,160
Homeopathy can ameliorate that state but not always.

370
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:23,640
And you have to remember this. For instance in case of an asthma, severe asthma,

371
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:31,070
especially when you have emphysema that means the lungs have given up,

372
01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:40,910
they are not anymore able to breath, bring air in and out.

373
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:48,160
You give the remedy there is an aggravation, the person is going to die.

374
01:05:48,670 --> 01:05:58,920
And you have to enter with allopathic drugs. This lecture is good I will give it to you.

375
01:06:00,410 --> 01:06:14,060
But now concerning the potency here we said the highest potency we start coming down here

376
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:23,420
still 200CH you can give here is a trick.

377
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:40,320
If you get physical pathology in the 7th, 8th level you have to go low, under 30CH or lower.

378
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:52,410
But if the pathology here is psychotic the person is mostly mentally disturbed

379
01:06:52,510 --> 01:07:08,760
then you can go as high as 1M, mental. In physical you will go up to 30CH, 12CH.

380
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:29,090
Here, this group I consider incurable by homeopathy, the 4th group.

381
01:07:29,190 --> 01:07:47,830
Here the remedies that will act will be up to 200CH, from 12D or 12X.

382
01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:57,860
D means decimal that means one over ten in the 6th or 12th power.

383
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:09,820
Or X which is the number ten in Latin. And we have 12CH centesimal,

384
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:15,330
one over a hundred in the 12th potency.

385
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:22,330
But the dilutions are made one over 100 they are not one over 10.

386
01:08:22,430 --> 01:08:26,570
This is weaker than this one.

387
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:38,490
The 12X is a weaker remedy though in 12X you may still find

388
01:08:38,590 --> 01:08:45,080
a molecule of the original substance in this.

389
01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:56,580
In this 1 over 100 in the 12th is going over the Avogadro number

390
01:08:56,680 --> 01:09:01,510
and there are no molecules anymore.

391
01:09:01,710 --> 01:09:07,850
-Last year I was here because of heart problem you said you have to wait

392
01:09:07,950 --> 01:09:14,020
and I have a fever after that of 38.5C.

393
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:22,520
If I had a fever again I should treat in homeopathically now.

394
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:29,370
-Yes. He needs to treat the fever.

395
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:45,700
-The question is what is the risk of having another endocarditis.

396
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:47,920
-It's a big risk I tell you.

397
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:54,920
I will explain I did not say everything but since he reminds me I will tell you

398
01:09:55,020 --> 01:10:01,240
that here as I said there is aggravation and no problem.

399
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:14,500
Here if there is after the second remedy there is a jump from 8 to 6 this case

400
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:19,110
you are going to have a big aggravation.

401
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:26,000
The aggravation is such that sometimes we cannot handle it homeopathically,

402
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:42,000
not because we don't have the remedies but we don't have the knowledge to enter immediately

403
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:51,510
with the first symptoms because the aggravation here is what he says is going to happen.

404
01:10:51,610 --> 01:10:57,250
Is going to be a pericarditis or an endocarditis.

405
01:10:57,350 --> 01:11:07,000
This moment you have to have enough knowledge to control this otherwise it's dangerous.

406
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:14,510
And then therefore what happens is that many times while you treat the fever appears

407
01:11:14,610 --> 01:11:25,250
and the reaction appears then get a fright from what is happening endocarditis

408
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:31,510
the symptoms are dramatic, you enter the hospital and has to take antibiotics.

409
01:11:31,610 --> 01:11:39,250
Then antibiotics will push him down again all over so we call it a relapse.

410
01:11:39,350 --> 01:11:45,510
Now he has a relapse because he took the drugs so you start again

411
01:11:45,610 --> 01:11:51,270
but as you start again and again the organism becomes stronger and stronger

412
01:11:51,370 --> 01:11:56,860
and the reactions are not so dangerous eventually.

413
01:11:57,860 --> 01:12:05,500
The reactions are manageable by the organism and if the reaction is manageable by the organism

414
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:17,610
the picture of the remedy they give out is clear. And the result can be fantastic.
