1
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:17,800
Your age is 31 year old and what is your main problem?

2
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:30,190
- My main problem is numbness and weakness of hands.

3
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:56,650
- And you have been treated homeopathically?
- For a long time. A lot remedies.

4
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:09,120
- How many years?
- For about 8-10 years.

5
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:21,680
- And the main problem was the original problem. For which you went to treatment.

6
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,240
- No.

7
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:28,980
- So the first time you went for treatment for what reason?

8
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:44,750
- It all started about 10 years ago. With infection. It looked like tonsillitis with high fever.

9
00:01:44,850 --> 00:02:00,260
- How high?
- 38.9C. I cannot remember.

10
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:07,140
- And you were 20 years old, by that time, 21.
-Yes 21.

11
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:12,000
- And you were in school? What were you doing?

12
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,170
- I was studying. I was a student.

13
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,410
- Student of what?

14
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:28,550
- I studied technology. It's a kind of technical subject.

15
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:39,470
- And this was the first time you got an infection or it was usual you got infections?

16
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:47,600
- I used to have infections, a lot of times. But this one was different.

17
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:58,300
- Was it too heavy or too strong?
- I didn't recuperate well.

18
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,660
- But did you take antibiotics?
- Yes.

19
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,440
- During that time? For how long? Do you remember?

20
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:14,330
- For this particular infection, it was just standard 10 days.

21
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:20,790
- And do you know the type? Penicillin type?
- I can't remember.

22
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,830
- Ok. Let me understand now.

23
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:30,190
Before you had infections as well and every time you took antibiotics?

24
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:36,070
- No, I had different kind of painkillers.

25
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,940
-  And for which you took what?

26
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:52,510
- Sometimes nothing, sometimes some aspirin but I quite often I had tonsillitis,

27
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:57,240
or not quite often, about once a year or something.

28
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:04,180
- With high fever or medium fever?
- Yes always high fever.

29
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:16,870
- The last time the fever was the highest or not so high? The problem was more serious?

30
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:21,360
- The fever was more or less the same.

31
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:30,320
But from the previous tonsillitis I was recuperated after the antibiotics quite well.

32
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:33,020
I had not problem after.

33
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,220
- But this time it was different.

34
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,480
- What was different? What happened after the antibiotics you felt...

35
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:50,590
- By the way I remember one thing. Before this final tonsillitis I had some kind of flu.

36
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:55,750
It looked like common influenza but not with high fever.

37
00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:01,740
And then after a week or two after that the tonsillitis came.

38
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:09,910
And I wasn't lying down in bed with the flu.

39
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:18,360
- And then you took antibiotics and then you felt weak or what...?

40
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:23,860
- First of all the pain of the throat didn't go away with the antibiotics

41
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:35,190
and it was very intense for one month and then it somehow eliminated

42
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:38,740
but it was there for about one year or two.

43
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,450
- You were seeing by a doctor or you just treated yourself?

44
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:48,180
- No, I was seeing a doctor, a general practitioner at that time.

45
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:56,500
- This case was not infectious mononucleosis?
- I don't know.

46
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:02,780
- The doctor he saw you he looked at your tonsils?
-Yes.

47
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,960
- And there was pus?

48
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,260
- I can't remember what she said but she said it was tonsillitis.

49
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:19,080
- With the severe pain?
- I used to have always serious pains.

50
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:24,890
This one was different, I remember details,

51
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:34,840
because I got pain in the throat before I got the fevers, I was normally functioning,

52
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:43,110
I had energy but I had pain in the throat as if I had tonsillitis.

53
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:47,750
I had never had something like this before.

54
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:56,450
- So for days you had pain in the tonsils?
- Yes 3 or 4 days

55
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,650
- As if there was an abscess there you felt?

56
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:05,360
- As if in my common tonsillitis I used to have before.

57
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:10,650
It was the same pain during swallowing.

58
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:16,210
- It was one side or both? 
- I can't remember now.

59
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:22,570
If I had tonsillitis at that time it was usually more prominent in one side.

60
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:26,220
- And then when the fever came you went to the doctor.

61
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,120
He looked at your tonsils?
- Yes.

62
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:36,790
- And he said you have tonsillitis, take this. How many minutes did he examine?

63
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:40,620
- I don't know, maybe 5.

64
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,170
- And he did not ask you a general blood examination?

65
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,840
- No.

66
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:55,550
- Did you have a blood examination later on?
- Yes.

67
00:07:55,650 --> 00:08:07,770
- And how was? Did you have the results?
- I can't remember.

68
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,600
- In the blood examinations there are some cells that are called monocytes.

69
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:17,300
Do you remember if this was increased?
- I don't think so.

70
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,150
- You don't think.

71
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:25,330
- The only thing that was found in my blood was much later on

72
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,800
because I developed chronic problems and I went to the doctor.

73
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:47,100
They took the blood and they found EB virus antibodies. Epstein- Barr.

74
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:56,790
But they said it's quite common and it's nothing. Also chlamydia antibodies as far as I remember.

75
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:05,930
But this was examined much later about 1-2 years later.

76
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:19,040
After the antibiotics I didn't feel energy, I didn't feel in good condition.

77
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:23,380
- You felt weak?
-Yes.

78
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,820
- With headache, with bad mood?

79
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,610
- Yes like slight headaches but I can't remember my mood by that time.

80
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:37,090
I was generally weak, I felt that the body didn't recuperate quite well.

81
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:43,500
I was tired and then I had this pain still but I didn't have fever.

82
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:53,050
- So later on did they put a diagnosis? Did they tell you what you are suffering from?

83
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:57,790
- No. But it was developing it was not the end.

84
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:08,690
I was just living my life, continued living and didn't pay much attention to it.

85
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:15,290
Because it was just some general fatigue.

86
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,420
- They did not say chronic fatigue syndrome.

87
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:25,680
- No they did not and I was actually 14 days at the hospital diagnosed all around

88
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:34,570
and they did also some tests they wanted to confirm the chronic fatigue syndrome

89
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:45,320
but they did not. What is important I think that 2 months after this tonsillitis

90
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:59,330
I developed chronic [?] , fever 37.1C constantly.

91
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:05,900
First it was about 6 in the evening, one hour a day.

92
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,990
- 6 to 7.

93
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:12,360
- Then it was 2 hours a day, then it was 3 hours a day, then it was all afternoon

94
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:17,760
and then after one year of this it was whole day.

95
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:29,190
- Did you have tubercular test?
- Yes, in the hospital later on.

96
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:41,720
I was done Mantoux test and it was borderline.

97
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:48,660
I was examined with x-ray of lungs and nothing was found.

98
00:11:53,790 --> 00:12:01,230
Then I started of course being more and more tired and generally exhausted.

99
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,020
That was the problem for which I came to my first homeopath.

100
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:15,610
- And since then you have received how many remedies, have you counted?

101
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:23,110
- I haven't counted because I don't know. Some of them he didn't tell me and I cannot remember.

102
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:27,360
- Some of the remedies are here...

103
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:32,450
- The first homeopath didn't give me so many remedies.

104
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:38,420
-In Czech?
- Always in Czech.

105
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:52,530
- Ars, Sil, Ruta, Gels, Caust, Fl-ac, Ph-ac, Abrot, Nux-v, Bar-c and a few others

106
00:12:52,630 --> 00:13:04,740
and then Psor, Phos, Ars, Sulph, Syph, Lyc and yourself you took what remedy finally?

107
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:20,990
- I took Psor, Ars, Phos. And I think these three I took myself.

108
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:26,600
- And also Cham.
- It was for acute tooth pain.

109
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:37,340
- Nat-m also
- Yes but I didn't take it myself.

110
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,460
- It was given to you?
- Yes, it was given to me.

111
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:54,090
Then I took Acon, Phos again, Pic-ac and Nux-v.

112
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:00,460
These I had to take because...

113
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,360
- From the 24 hours which is the worst hours to you?

114
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:12,160
You wake up in the morning?
- Do you mean now?

115
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:17,160
- The last months.

116
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:27,270
- The last months generally I think in the morning I have the most energy.

117
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:31,020
Till the evening it goes down.

118
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:36,190
- The more you get tired the more you lose energy.

119
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:39,100
- That is the situation.

120
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:44,730
- What time you go to bed?
- 22.00-23.00.

121
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,230
- Are you married?
- No.

122
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:53,980
- Divorced?
- No. I have a girlfriend.

123
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:05,070
- You have been infected with venereal or something? Venereal type of disease?

124
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:10,020
- I don't think so, I don't have no idea.

125
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,440
- There was no discharge from the urethra?
- No, never.

126
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,330
- There was no inflammation there?
- Never.

127
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,570
- And your weight was always like this?

128
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:33,280
- No. I lost weight the last 5 years or something.

129
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:38,100
After the treatment of some homeopaths I lost weight.

130
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:43,520
- How much?
- About 10 kilos.

131
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:53,820
- Because you did not have enough appetite or just you were losing...?

132
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,900
- First of all I was on a diet. I still am.

133
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,020
- Why?

134
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:08,070
- Because first of all I had some digestive troubles

135
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:16,760
and the second thing I found out that at the time I had these fevers,

136
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:24,950
this low fever constant, that diet makes me well.

137
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:32,150
I have more energy then I was generally better when I was on a diet.

138
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,340
- If you are vegetarian?
- I'm not a vegetarian.

139
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,290
- If you're careful with your diet...
- Yes, I am careful.

140
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:42,910
- Which means, you have to eat what?

141
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:49,320
- Basically not much fat, nothing fried,

142
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:56,160
basically nothing that does bad to liver or gallbladder suffering people...

143
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,950
This makes me good.

144
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:09,770
- Do you have any glands swollen? 
- In the past I had, now not so much.

145
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:13,790
- In the past? How long ago?

146
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:22,760
- At the time I got this infection 10 years ago and maybe 2-3 years later.

147
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:35,990
- You have swollen glands, sublingual...Only.  Not glands somewhere else.

148
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,860
-No, as far as I know.

149
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:43,320
- Your stool is normal or you have diarrheic stool?

150
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,690
- Now, normal.

151
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:54,070
- It was diarrheic?
-No, one time it was more constipation. One time.

152
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:57,800
- One time, never diarrhea.

153
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:11,070
- When I started eating olive oil I started having a little bit loose stool but not diarrhea.

154
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:14,070
- You like olive oil?

155
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:28,780
- Yes but I eat it mainly because it is healthy. Later on I liked also the taste.

156
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:33,160
- Do you know what condylomata are? Did you have any condylomata?

157
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,530
- No.

158
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:39,330
- Never?
- Never. I started with my sexual life late.

159
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:49,930
- How late?
- Well, actually about 2 years ago.

160
00:18:53,890 --> 00:19:00,460
- You did not have any contact previously?
- Not a sexual contact.

161
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:12,730
- And since when you developed this numbness in your hands?

162
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:20,660
- It was after I was treated for the fevers by the first homeopath.

163
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,530
First of all it started with weakness of the muscles.

164
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,220
I was a professional guitarist.

165
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:49,150
- You have trembling...?
- A little bit I have trembling.

166
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:54,940
- Can you stretch?
- Yes a little bit I think so.

167
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:05,970
- Lift it a little bit.
-For quite many years I think.

168
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:09,490
- You feel the trembling yourself, right?

169
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:14,440
- Yes but of course now I am excited. I am a bit nervous.

170
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:19,540
- And when you are nervous you tremble...

171
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:26,510
- Not in the absolute ease because I've never been in such situation.

172
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:33,360
Not very difficult but not absolutely relaxed.

173
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:41,940
- I see. So you never took Tub?
- No.

174
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:44,820
- Bac?
- No.

175
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:50,110
- Do you have grinding of the teeth during sleep?

176
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:59,350
- I am not aware of it, I don't know but my girlfriend hasn't told me.

177
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:08,610
- But your dentist would have seen it if you were grinding your teeth.

178
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:12,490
You never had problems with your...

179
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:19,160
- I have a lot of problems with my teeth since I was a child.

180
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:22,910
- With carries?

181
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:33,860
- Yes carries and abscesses and I have an extra teeth, supernumerary.

182
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:41,890
Which has to be taken out. I had nines here.

183
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,310
- You had one extra teeth.
- No, 5-6.

184
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,070
- 5 extra teeth?

185
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:55,570
- Yes when I was a child I had two here they were taken away

186
00:21:55,670 --> 00:22:08,730
and then I have one here and I have two ninth teeth here. The one was taken away.

187
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,330
- Your father is alive?
- Yes.

188
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:17,170
- How old is he?
- He is 56.

189
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:26,150
- He has problem with his nervous system?
- No.

190
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,500
- Walks nicely?
- He's quite healthy.

191
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,640
- He can run?
- Yes. He is a sportsman.

192
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:42,400
He plays sports twice or three times a week. Football and everything. He is very vital.

193
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,270
- Your mother? Is she alive?
- Yes.

194
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:48,940
- She has a problem?
- Yes she has some problems.

195
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,310
- What is..?

196
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:24,490
- She has in her uterus some kind of benign tumors. This is the last problem she has.

197
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:31,160
- Otherwise her mental state is ok or she is hysterical?

198
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:42,800
- Wow! I wouldn't say she is emotionally absolutely balanced but...

199
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,080
- Is she reacting in a hysterical way?

200
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:55,520
- Maybe when she was arguing with my father. Sometimes she can be hysterical.

201
00:23:55,620 --> 00:24:04,190
Yes, she can be hysterical actually. But between us this situation...

202
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:12,370
- You are more attached to your mother?
- Definitely. Since childhood.

203
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:19,430
- You have a brother or sister?
- Brother.

204
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:33,460
- Is he having any problems?
- Yes but I would say functional things.

205
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:45,020
He's got some nausea, constant and chronic nausea but nothing serious as far as I know.

206
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:51,750
- You say you do not eat fat.
- I eat fat. But only...

207
00:24:51,850 --> 00:25:02,200
- Do you like fat?
- In small or normal amount I like.

208
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:10,050
- When you used to eat meat.
- I eat meat now.

209
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:14,170
- You like?
- Not particularly.

210
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:24,960
- Which type of meat you like the best?
- Maybe chicken. I am not sure.

211
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:33,430
- You have a pain in the right hypochondria?
- Yes, quite often.

212
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:41,650
- Since when?
- For about 5 years.

213
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:51,400
- Why? Do you know a reason? You have been examined to see if the gallbladder is functioning?

214
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:56,180
- No, nothing was found. No stones or something like it.

215
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:06,750
- Lazy gallbladder, they told you?
- I was not diagnosed. I've been to doctors.

216
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:11,590
- But they say nothing, they can find nothing.

217
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:16,470
And the pain is... can you show me the place.
- Yes.

218
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:24,820
- And this pain extends to the back sometimes?

219
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:32,320
- Not, really but sometimes it gets to both sides.

220
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:38,290
- At the same time?
- Yes , at the same time.

221
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:46,150
Especially when it gets irritated, when I eat something more it hurts on both sides.

222
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:54,340
- Mostly when you eat something like eggs, or milky products or meat or fat?

223
00:26:54,440 --> 00:27:02,860
- Mostly when I eat a lot of fat or if I eat a lot of chocolate,

224
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:13,920
something which I don't eat normally. But now I eat chocolate quite a lot. One time I was very hard.

225
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:20,940
I was very fastidious in my diet.

226
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:25,470
- Very fastidious for your food.
- Yes.

227
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:30,630
- But it seems to me that you like fat, actually.

228
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:37,440
Pork you eat?
- Sometimes, not very much.

229
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:42,120
Especially for the last 2 years I don't have much desire for fatty meat

230
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:49,780
or for pork but I don't remember being keen on fat ever.

231
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:57,740
- About meat which is smoked?
- Not particularly.

232
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,660
- You can eat it.
- I can.

233
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:04,480
But now I don't eat it because I am very fastidious in my diet.

234
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:10,560
But I didn't like eating it, it was not my best.

235
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,440
- You eat salami?
- Normal, I like them...

236
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:21,350
- What do you like to eat best?

237
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:34,150
- I've always liked cheese, tomato, stuff like Italian cuisine, pasta...

238
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:42,910
but it could be also meat with tomato pasta I like very much at one time.

239
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:49,840
I like it now as well. And sweets I like.

240
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:13,220
- How much salt you use?
- Quite a lot. My girlfriend says I use a lot of salt.

241
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,770
- You always used to use a lot of it?

242
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:26,460
- I don't remember because I started perceiving these things since I started Homeopathy.

243
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:29,270
- But you don't remember as a child eating salt?

244
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:32,180
- No I don't think I did this.

245
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:40,320
- Strange fear of death you have before going to sleep.

246
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:43,790
- Not as a child, as a teenager.

247
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,480
- Not now.
- No.

248
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:53,490
- Do you have any fear now? Fear of the dark?

249
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:59,400
- I don't feel very well in the dark. Especially when I am alone.

250
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:07,340
When I am alone in the house but it is not a big fear but I don't feel at ease.

251
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:13,020
In the dark and alone...

252
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,220
-You prefer to have somebody always.

253
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,140
- Not because of the fear but I like company.

254
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:25,230
- You feel better with company.
- Yes.

255
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,480
- Because of anxiety about your health.

256
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:47,320
- No, I would say the opposite. When I'm alone if feel generally worse. Especially my mood is worse.

257
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:53,840
- So when you have company, it fixes your mood.

258
00:30:53,940 --> 00:31:02,570
- I wouldn't say it like this, I'm not sure about it. Definitely I'm better with company.

259
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:09,750
- Any other fear?

260
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:14,760
- For the past few years I was very anxious about myself, in general.

261
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:17,650
- About your health?
- Yes.

262
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:27,030
And for example when I have a remedy I have fear the remedy will be antidoted, very apprehensive.

263
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:35,970
Fear about catching some disease.

264
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:52,680
I know I am a little bit underweight, so I know if a get some gastrointestinal disease

265
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:58,740
I could have some problems, not now but 5 years ago my weight was even lower.

266
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:05,790
- Do you have fear of catching AIDS?

267
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:12,310
- Also, all kinds of diseases.

268
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:21,310
- You have fear of all infectious diseases?

269
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:27,430
- Many of them, I don't know if for all of them but quite a lot.

270
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:40,770
- For salt, how many times would you underline your desire?

271
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:44,650
- 2 or 3.
- 2 or 3. Strong.

272
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:59,190
- Because I don't use much spices, for example pepper... I have a pain in the hypochondria after it.

273
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:14,580
Salt sort of supplies some taste to food. But I like salty food.

274
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:25,140
- Do you like cats, dogs?
- Yes.

275
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:29,580
When I was a child I was very much afraid of dogs.

276
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:35,880
- Big dogs or even small dogs?
- Even the small I think.

277
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,150
- Cats?
- No. I don't remember.

278
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:44,490
- Can you pet a cat?
- Yes sure, definitely, no problem.

279
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:49,830
And now the dogs also. We have a dog with my girlfriend.

280
00:33:54,180 --> 00:34:02,330
-In the sea, when you bath, you feel good?
- Yes, I like the sea.

281
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:03,450
- Or you feel worse?

282
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:13,790
- No, I feel the same or good. I love the sea.

283
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:22,950
-Did you have any time Med.?
- No. I don't think.

284
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:27,770
- But you don't know the remedies they gave you.

285
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:42,110
You went to a homeopath that had the custom to give 3 remedies daily for 2-3 months?

286
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,700
- Every day.

287
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,600
- At that time you took a lot of remedies but you don't know the type.

288
00:34:49,700 --> 00:35:01,420
- I can't remember all of them because they were so many of them. This was my 3rd homeopath.

289
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:09,860
- The general appetite which you have according to you is normal,

290
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:14,740
that means you eat a normal amount of food?

291
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,830
- I would say that I eat quite a lot.

292
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:27,380
Some people have told me how it is possible that I eat so much, big amounts and I am so thin.

293
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:45,250
So I have appetite. I don't eat fatty food. I eat diet, healthy but big amounts.

294
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:50,600
- In general you feel cold or hot or normal?

295
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:59,580
- For the last 3-4 years I felt very cold but for the last month

296
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:15,650
since I got this last remedy (Nux-v., Pic-ac...) I feel warm again. But I felt cold for many years.

297
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:20,800
In the beginning when I had these fevers I had flushes of heat and I felt hot.

298
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:30,470
Later on I lost weight and I started feeling cold. Originally I had flushes of heat.

299
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:43,110
- You have some eczema in your hands?
- Yes.

300
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:50,140
The eczema developed together with the numbness.

301
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:57,880
- Where is the eczema? Can you show me?
- Here.

302
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:02,870
- You mean more dryness? There is itching?

303
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:07,230
- I went to a dermatologist and she said it's an eczema.

304
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:16,260
It's not itching so much, it's red, it's not now I have it only in winter.

305
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:26,430
In the summer I don't have it a lot. Only in cold months.

306
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:35,950
- Do you have any difficulty in breathing? You have to sigh like this?

307
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,870
- I am not aware.

308
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:49,990
- How is your sexual desire?
- Quite high, not low, normal.

309
00:37:51,260 --> 00:38:01,760
It depends on how tired I am, how much I work. I don't know what can you say it's normal.

310
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:14,030
- Each one has his own...for you...
- For me it's normal.

311
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:18,730
I wouldn't say I'm a slave of my... no, not at all.

312
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:27,770
Shall I confess one thing to you?
- Yes.

313
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:38,230
- Many times during in a homeopathic consultation like this I tend to laugh involuntarily,

314
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:45,440
now it's the same. I am excited and I have the tendency to laugh. I don't know why.

315
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:53,480
- This happens when you are in other serious conditions? It may happen to you.

316
00:38:54,930 --> 00:39:03,470
- Once it happened in funeral, I didn't feel very good.

317
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:20,770
- How's your memory?
- Not very good.

318
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:24,360
- You tend to forget?

319
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:33,880
- I have to concentrate very much on doing some mental work

320
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:43,770
and actually one month ago I developed a kind of peculiar state

321
00:39:43,870 --> 00:40:00,350
when I studied quite a lot for about a year very intensively I developed a headache with nausea

322
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:20,800
and with numbness in the whole half of the body. Leg and hand and half of the face.

323
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:24,360
- Had you taken Causticum during that time?

324
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:38,390
- No, 4 days I took Bell, Acon and finally Nux-v which did something. And I also ended studying.

325
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:47,920
But the memory is not good. I have to strain to remember.

326
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:53,500
- To remember what you have to do, to remember what you read?

327
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:57,470
- In reading actually I have problems paying attention.

328
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:05,760
When I read a few lines I go to the beginning again because I didn't pay attention.

329
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:18,890
Sometimes this happens quite lately that when I want to say a word,

330
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:22,930
I'm searching for some word and...

331
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:24,840
- You cannot find the word.

332
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:30,240
- I can but 2 words come and I cannot decide which one to use.

333
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:41,020
And finally I use some kind of hybrid of the 2. Half and half. It's a quite late symptom.

334
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:51,900
- When has this happened?
- One or two years.

335
00:41:56,260 --> 00:42:06,740
And I am concerning my memory for the last few months especially I was very absentminded.

336
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,060
I will give an example to be clear.

337
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:21,120
When I study I watch a seminar from the e-learning I watch the video...

338
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:27,430
When I'm watching, after a few minutes I start doing something else.

339
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:35,000
I start searching something on the Internet as if the mind was saying

340
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:40,080
"No more please, I'm overloaded". I have this feeling.

341
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:45,910
- If I understand well when you study suddenly your mind goes away

342
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:53,000
and then you start something else and you feel you had enough of this, you cannot control...

343
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:58,350
- I force myself to go back to the original subject.

344
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:09,050
- You had otitis a few times.
- As a child.

345
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:24,150
- But the fever which you had the 39C fever was 10 years the last time with this big fever.

346
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:42,990
-No. But I had this big fever 39C about a year or half a year ago when I took Psor. I had 39C fever.

347
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:52,520
- For what? Tonsils?
- No, I had some kind of general of flu.

348
00:43:54,490 --> 00:44:06,550
It was a cold and general fatigue, general malaise, influenza.

349
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:14,490
I've never suffered with real influenza and this was let's say a strong cold.

350
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:16,810
But it was mainly fever.

351
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:26,700
I didn't have strong coryza, I didn't have strong cough but the fever was 39C for 2 days.

352
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:36,280
- You took Psor today and it was in 2 days...
- No it was in 3 weeks after.

353
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:45,360
- During these 3 weeks you felt better? In general, more energy?

354
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:54,100
- I don't know, I cannot tell for 100%.

355
00:44:56,580 --> 00:45:06,980
I maybe I wrote somewhere but I cut can't find it now... I have information only about fever

356
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:10,480
and I had swollen here...

357
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:23,690
- Here you report you said Psor you took 4 doses

358
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:27,530
and immediately felt a mental/emotional amelioration.

359
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:32,940
- Yes that's when I took it for the first time. It was about 3 years ago.

360
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:41,320
- "I felt very well and relaxed during the first day. Hear problems ceased after few hours

361
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:50,610
and 10 days later I got a cold with coryza and fever 37.5C." Not 39C.

362
00:45:50,710 --> 00:46:03,150
- That was the first time I took Psor. Then I took it later on myself. And it was 39.

363
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:06,480
- Psor. Fistula in gum appeared.

364
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:09,350
- After this fever.

365
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:19,210
- A single dose 3 weeks later an acute with high fever up to 39C one day. 37.6C...

366
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:26,390
Recovered slowly without any remedies. Then stand still repeated...

367
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:35,060
But you don't write how you felt, in general. Fistula in gum appeared one month later.

368
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:45,230
Frequent eructations, extreme thirst, frequent urination, sensation of fullness after eating

369
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:50,100
then intense pain in the hypochondria, both sides, chilliness,

370
00:46:50,200 --> 00:47:02,470
after few days repeated Psor, no change. And then you took Phos. Repeated Phos.

371
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:09,390
And you have premature ejaculation.

372
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:23,750
- I was trying to put down some clear symptoms. Objective.

373
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,720
- Ok, we go inside.

374
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:58,930
I think that for those medical doctors present this was a good example case

375
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:12,950
how we make a diagnosis in homeopathy and irrespective of the laboratory tests.

376
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:20,160
In order to understand what's going on in a human organism.

377
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:32,050
So what's going on in his organism? What happens? What is the problem?

378
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:49,520
The first thing that I would like for you to remember in this case is what I have said

379
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:55,500
I think in the morning concerning...

380
00:48:55,600 --> 00:49:01,000
I am confused I don't know if I told you or yesterday to the previous class, but anyhow...

381
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:09,570
I will repeat that a severe acute condition

382
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:17,720
if suppressed maybe be transferred to a sub-acute inflammation.

383
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:23,980
And all chronic conditions according to my understanding

384
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:32,340
are sub-acute chronic inflammation conditions. All of them.

385
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:37,250
Whether it is schizophrenia, whether it is an autoimmune disease

386
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:50,120
or whether it is any degenerative disease is of a sub-acute inflammatory condition.

387
00:49:52,330 --> 00:50:03,280
In his case strangely enough the sub-acute appears also in fever. He has a high fever

388
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:11,610
which is suppressed, why it is suppressed, because of wrong treatment

389
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:16,210
because they did not understand what he was suffering from.

390
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:24,780
The doctor who examined him did not realize that most probably he had an abscess in the tonsil

391
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,660
and that's why he was feeling pain for days

392
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:37,280
and then eventually the high fever there was an abscess in the tonsils which developed

393
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:42,600
in what is called acute infectious mononucleosis.

394
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:51,520
Which is quite a serious condition and it has to be treated with care,

395
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:57,950
there are no medicines for that, usually they give cortisone I think

396
00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:06,190
and the usual 10 days antibiotics which make things worse, suppressed the fever

397
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:14,280
and then the organism gave up and he starting having an effort every day

398
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:17,640
to recover through this inflammation.

399
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:27,080
Because the inflammation is always for a good reason. You cannot suppress an inflammation.

400
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:35,910
An inflammation is the way the organism is recuperating itself, it's coming back to normal.

401
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:38,910
It's only through an inflammation.

402
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:46,160
Whether there is a fever manifesting in the physical body it is a different thing.

403
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:54,220
When there is a high fever the organism shows it has power,

404
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:58,830
the immune system is in a good condition.

405
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:17,220
Actually as far as levels of health are concerned this is a man

406
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:30,730
who had frequent acutes with high fever so his condition could be considered

407
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:41,180
before this episode as level what...? Which level?

408
00:52:45,560 --> 00:53:02,470
Frequent acutes are level 6 and we have that an organism who is easily brining up acute problems,

409
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:13,550
otitis, cystitis, bronchitis, whatever treated each time with antibiotics there is a time

410
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:20,770
when the acutes subside and there is a manifestation

411
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:25,800
of a chronic sub-inflammatory condition.

412
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:41,710
This is the rule which has never been observed in medicine.

413
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:50,760
But it is a fact and this is exactly what I was talking about.

414
00:53:52,730 --> 00:54:04,350
So level 6 he was, frequent acutes treated badly he went with a sub-inflammatory condition

415
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:12,360
into level 7. Started a chronic degenerative process.

416
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:19,740
So for me for 10 years he is in this condition.

417
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:43,810
Last year he got a fever after Psor. So he got out of level 7 to level 6. Is this?

418
00:54:43,910 --> 00:55:05,250
No, it's not. I'll tell you why. Psor was a remedy close enough to the condition.

419
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:20,130
For a time being gave some energy to his body and his body managed for 1 day to get 39.

420
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:23,360
And the subsided back to level 7.

421
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:33,220
Otherwise you would have seen first of all not 1 day only but several days of fever

422
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:41,550
then you would see after 2 months again another acute and another acute to come to level 6

423
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:46,650
where we have frequent acutes. We did not see that.

424
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:53,600
Therefore we come to the conclusion that the remedies have been given so far

425
00:55:53,700 --> 00:56:03,330
were all wrong except of Psor which was not totally wrong but it was a close remedy.

426
00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:15,560
Otherwise his condition has not been helped so far by homeopathy. 10 years of homeopathy...

427
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:22,960
lots of remedies... but maybe never the correct remedy was given.

428
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:34,320
So this is unless you know the theory you can go on and give remedies after remedies

429
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:35,520
and what happens...

430
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:55,960
Confusion more confusion... But the confusion for his organism is not so dramatic.

431
00:56:56,190 --> 00:57:04,620
Because he says I felt weak and I still feel weak. Now I have some numbness also.

432
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:10,000
So the condition in which he is now the syndrome

433
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:18,370
if we want to speak with terms of conventional medicine we would say

434
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:23,120
that this is a post viral syndrome.

435
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:35,140
The chronic fatigue syndrome, they call it post viral syndrome.

436
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:46,670
That means they have noticed that once a person had a fever and they gave antibiotics

437
00:57:46,770 --> 00:57:53,170
they realize that this persons goes into chronic fatigue syndrome.

438
00:57:53,270 --> 00:58:04,750
This is a big diagnosis. Usually in such a case Epstein- Barr antibodies are found.

439
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:18,410
This is condition used to be called benign encephalomyelitis, then Epstein- Barr,

440
00:58:18,510 --> 00:58:27,000
then post viral syndrome and then forgot about post viral syndrome quickly

441
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:37,450
and named it chronic fatigue syndrome, just like that. How come chronic fatigue syndrome?

442
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:44,180
It doesn't come just like that, by itself. Something you have done to this organism.

443
00:58:57,130 --> 00:59:05,520
Why the infectious mononucleosis had such a severe effect?

444
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:17,660
It is because his organism coming from mother and father has a weak immune system.

445
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:25,250
Why the immune system is weak?

446
00:59:25,350 --> 00:59:30,120
Most probably because of the condition of the mother.

447
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:38,180
The condition of the mother is emotionally very weak.

448
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:52,420
So the mixture of mother and father they bring out an organism which is not strong,

449
00:59:52,520 --> 01:00:07,200
not powerful to fight and very easy staphylococcal infections, quite frequent...

450
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:27,890
The pathology as it appears is as I said what they call chronic fatigue syndrome

451
01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:32,630
with one difference in his case;

452
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:50,090
the type of pathology, you see they say another story,

453
01:00:50,190 --> 01:01:01,170
the chronic fatigue syndrome imitates all possible syndromes, whatever.

454
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:12,050
It can imitate mental pathology, neurological pathology, all kinds of pathologies.

455
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:18,320
What can you make out of that?

456
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:24,800
That means we don't have a standard picture of the chronic fatigue symptom.

457
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:32,800
We have several symptomatologies put together, one person with this, totality of symptoms,

458
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:35,430
another with this, another with this...

459
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:49,600
The main line which runs through all these cases is the fatigue which is on the nervous,

460
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:58,890
on the muscular system. This is the common factor actually.

461
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:10,770
And then in his case he has a hectic fever with good appetite but losing weight.

462
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:22,990
So if we want to treat such a case we have to go to the basis of the pathology.

463
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:36,270
The basis of the pathology is such that imitates actually which disease?

464
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:57,890
Which is the disease that people may eat but lose weight with hectic fever? Tuberculosis.

465
01:03:00,370 --> 01:03:08,630
Does he have tuberculosis? When I asked him he said he had the Mantoux and is borderline.

466
01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:16,480
May be yes, or may be not. We're not talking about active tuberculosis.

467
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:25,460
But we are talking about a predisposition in his organism

468
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:34,010
which brings along from his ancestors the tubercular miasm.

469
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:37,620
Which under the stress of antibiotics

470
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:46,810
and the wrong treatment has manifested now as an imitation of tuberculosis.

471
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:58,260
So there is in his ancestry the tubercular miasm most probably

472
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:07,300
he does not know whether his grandfather, grandmother had tuberculosis.

473
01:04:11,530 --> 01:04:17,750
Your mother or grandmother?

474
01:04:17,850 --> 01:04:33,070
She had tuberculosis? She died from tuberculosis? Ok, I will repeat.

475
01:04:33,830 --> 01:04:45,090
The grand-grandmother had tuberculosis but it is not certain that his grandmother was born before

476
01:04:45,190 --> 01:04:56,460
or after the tuberculosis. Correct? He thinks it was after. But it does not matter.

477
01:04:56,560 --> 01:05:00,080
When somebody who is prepared to have tuberculosis,

478
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:06,180
it's the miasm which comes. That's the one.

479
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:11,830
There is not only this problem, there is another problem with ancestry.

480
01:05:11,930 --> 01:05:28,760
Which is the next problem? Most probably we realize that by what?

481
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:32,730
What is very peculiar is his case?

482
01:05:42,270 --> 01:05:56,930
He was better in the sea? Not exactly very much better. Tell me and I will repeat...

483
01:05:58,610 --> 01:06:06,510
- The time that you asked him if mother was hysterical or she had emotional problems...

484
01:06:06,610 --> 01:06:28,510
- How I got it...You ask too much. It is through looking. Fear of taking virus.

485
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:41,870
It's not very peculiar. Yes that's it. The dental pathology.

486
01:06:45,730 --> 01:06:57,120
What he gave as information 9 extra teeth which are coming through this. 5 ok.

487
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:10,440
5 is more than enough. 5 extra teeth which came in an irregular way.

488
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:21,020
Which we know that such a condition is due to syphilis.

489
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:30,120
Not that he has syphilis himself or his father but a syphilitic miasm that comes through ancestors.

490
01:07:30,350 --> 01:07:36,300
So therefore from his case we come to the conclusion

491
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:45,380
that when he was born he was bringing with him 2 miasms, the tubercular and the also the syphilitic.

492
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:49,800
We have reasons to substantiate this.

493
01:07:51,750 --> 01:08:01,550
Now we examined the case and we have to make a decision of the remedy which he has to take.

494
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:13,770
And what is the remedy? I'll show you something. How many symptoms you put? 19.

495
01:08:13,870 --> 01:08:17,160
Ok. Show me 19 symptoms.

496
01:08:21,870 --> 01:08:30,060
Desire for company, concentration difficult, fear of contagion, memory weakness...

497
01:08:30,270 --> 01:08:43,750
teeth irregular, swelling of cervical glands. When I asked for cervical glands was why?

498
01:08:45,390 --> 01:08:59,980
Because of... Why did I ask him whether he has swollen glands? Because of tuberculosis? No.

499
01:09:00,940 --> 01:09:04,010
I was thinking something else but doesn't matter.

500
01:09:06,210 --> 01:09:22,110
Hectic fever, eruptions in winter, ailments after influenza, great appetite with emaciation,

501
01:09:22,210 --> 01:09:30,910
desires sea, salt, sweets, tonsillitis recurrent, weakness fever during etc..

502
01:09:31,630 --> 01:09:51,580
And the remedy is, show them, Tuberculinum. Show the columns.

503
01:09:51,680 --> 01:10:04,130
I'll show you something I tried to confirm the Tub. I could not really confirm it.

504
01:10:04,230 --> 01:10:20,180
First of all because there was no disgust with cats and dogs and fat desire was not really strong.

505
01:10:22,130 --> 01:10:33,910
And the lungs... there were no problems here really so I did not like Tub.

506
01:10:39,380 --> 01:11:05,230
What you will give him? You don't know. You are the yogi? Bacillinum? Congratulations.

507
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:18,060
Bac. You see it's very interesting, on the 2nd column, you see Bac is coming

508
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:31,120
yet if you have to explain why the symptoms are very few. But I will tell you something.

509
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:48,430
Tub has how many symptoms? 12 symptoms. And Bac has only 3. And yet I would prefer to give Bac.

510
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:57,880
The reason is when you cannot confirm Tub give Bac.

511
01:12:07,910 --> 01:12:15,680
Who was here on the little boy problems from Russia?

512
01:12:19,330 --> 01:12:30,020
Lots of remedies had been given. Had a similar condition. The boy was doing very well on Bac.

513
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:39,480
Of course this is not the reason. The reason is the 2 remedies are quite similar.

514
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:44,780
The general picture is the same but the Bac is does not necessarily

515
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:51,680
have the fear of cats and dogs and the desire for fat.

516
01:12:51,780 --> 01:13:05,750
So therefore I would prefer Bac 200CH one dose and we'll see what happens.

517
01:13:07,710 --> 01:13:11,120
Did you agree?

518
01:13:16,290 --> 01:13:22,520
- May I ask you what didn't you take into consideration the anxiety about health?

519
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:31,330
- We take it into account, yes, why not? If you want anxiety about health, put anxiety about health.

520
01:13:33,290 --> 01:13:38,340
He has great anxiety about health. I'll tell you something with this case.

521
01:13:38,950 --> 01:13:45,470
Do not think that after Bac everything will be gone but it is the first remedy

522
01:13:45,570 --> 01:13:54,700
that will lift the organism, the immune system and then we'll give some energy to the body

523
01:13:54,800 --> 01:14:04,230
and eventually he will develop the next remedy which will be most probably...

524
01:14:04,330 --> 01:14:11,460
fear of the dark...Phos which was given repeatedly and did not act.

525
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:14,080
After Bac it will act.

526
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:23,100
This is why I said it is so important when you start a case to start correctly.

527
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:30,130
Otherwise you will confuse the case and you will not find it a way out.
