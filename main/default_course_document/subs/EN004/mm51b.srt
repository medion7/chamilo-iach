1
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:29,519
Many times you have to prescribe very quickly in a busy practice.

2
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:48,359
There are certain symptoms or signs that are almost sure that you don't need to take very thoroughly the case.

3
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:09,769
These are for children now I'm going to talk about because I have found out that in spite of the fact that there are

4
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:20,119
 such signs by taking a case thoroughly,
 you miss the right prescription.

5
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:33,749
If you have these keynotes which I'm going to tell you, the first remedy that you have to think and give

6
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,809
is the one that I will mention.

7
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:59,419
In children from babies to 12 years old, if you see perspiration here on the cervical region during sleep

8
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:15,539
strong perspiration, where the pillow becomes wet, the remedy is Calc. forget all the other remedies.

9
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:31,959
Whether it is a pneumonia, diarrhea, nephritis, epilepsy, it does not matter.

10
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:55,352
Excessive salivation which runs out of the mouth, even when the child is held in the mother's lap.

11
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:05,079
It comes with the mother and the salivation runs out not only when the child is lying down but when it's standing

12
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:11,989
like this in the mother's lap. First remedy Mercury.

13
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:22,959
You see them in the table they take salt and they put it in their mouth. What is the remedy?

14
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,199
The remedy is Nat-m.

15
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:39,089
But if you open the Repertory, you will see several remedies there with capital letters. None of these remedies will do this.

16
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:46,039
The only remedy that will do it is Nat-m.  Why?

17
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,399
Because the craving is very strong.

18
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:02,639
You examine the children and you cannot find anything and then you come and you say salt.

19
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,499
Salt? She takes it and eats it. Finished the case.

20
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:38,069
When you see an eruption in the nates and the perineum like the one I showed you on the video, reddish

21
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:52,320
reddish like this, if it is pale red, it is not
 correct, it has to be reddish like her dress.

22
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,190
Medorrhinum.

23
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:22,099
Repeated vomiting in whatever case but especially with coughing.

24
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:27,249
Coughing which causes vomiting, Ip.

25
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:50,409
Children they go to bed and they rattle, especially in the middle of the night it becomes prominent

26
00:05:50,410 --> 00:06:02,129
and many times they wake up also because of the noise and the noise can be heard in the room, the remedy Kali-s.

27
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:19,059
Thirst but the child seems to be afraid, it doesn't moan, it doesn't do anything but it's terrified, afraid, Phos.

28
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:25,399
Thirst with fear.

29
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:39,160
I told you, as an example, I will give you Phos. Maybe you don't understand because you have to be

30
00:06:39,161 --> 00:06:41,889
to be observant in such cases.

31
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:49,099
The mother many times does not understand what is going on in the child.

32
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:54,319
 She doesn't understand that the child is fearful.

33
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:07,509
I told you about this case with the meningitis, where the child was lying next to the mother and the mother

34
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:11,969
 needed to hold the child's hand.

35
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,289
And the child was afraid to be left alone.

36
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:34,049
The parents though they were homeopaths they could not see the picture. When I went there and they gave me

37
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:45,119
 all nonsense because they said meningitis and they give all this information, what is important for me is how much

38
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:53,279
 water the child was asking and whether the mother could leave the child without holding the hand.

39
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:59,049
And that was a cure of meningitis the same day.

40
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:15,049
Phos.  especially the children, have fear of being left alone. They don't want to be left alone.

41
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,839
It says desires company. Fear of being alone.

42
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:42,840
Big warts on fingers, in the Repertory
 it says, Lac-c. I say Thuja.

43
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:55,119
A lot of warts on the face, big warts, strong warts, Calc.

44
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:17,969
Moaning and groaning, children with teething, of course Cham.

45
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:29,869
But moaning and groaning and complaining, no reason for that, they cannot themselves give a reason

46
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:36,499
or you cannot find a reason, it is Calc-p.

47
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:08,999
Open fontanelles which have remained
longer than they should again Calc-p.

48
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:36,240
Moaning with digestive troubles, either vomiting or diarrhea, but the child really cannot be satisfied...

49
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:45,879
....Ant-c.

50
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:08,689
Hot head with cold feet, Bell.

51
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:21,189
You see what I say, you know. Forget that you know, what I say is when you have that symptom

52
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:28,379
you think and give this remedy. This is the idea. Otherwise most probably you're making a mistake.

53
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:39,839
Pay big attention to these symptoms.
Otherwise you will make a mistake.

54
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:53,699
Hot head but hot feet also, again with high fever and red face, because the face in Bell. is red, what is the remedy?

55
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:02,920
Acon.

56
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:16,039
The red face is there, the head is hot and then you touch the feet but the feet are hot also

57
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:22,519
and the fever is high, then the remedy Acon.

58
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:51,879
The position in children that they sleep with knee-elbow position, if it is persistent, Med.

59
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:57,119
What other remedies they sleep in that position?

60
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:07,341
Kali-c., Calc-p.

61
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:15,959
Didn't we have here the case with the child that we analyzed the Calc-p.?

62
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:50,859
Colics in children with rumbling in regular intervals, every two hours, they go away and again and again

63
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:55,239
 what is the remedy?

64
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:22,719
Illicium. They used to give the old mothers the mother tincture.

65
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:57,000
Colics where the child has a lot of eructations.

66
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:06,170
Lycopodium.

67
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:13,380
Colics where you turn the child on the abdomen and it becomes quiet...

68
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,200
 Belladonna.

69
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:42,650
Colics where you take the child and you press his feet against the abdomen and gets quiet...

70
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,170
Colocynthis.

71
00:15:53,190 --> 00:16:03,829
Child that he cries when you put him in bed, Borx.

72
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:32,239
It doesn't matter what it is, whether it is an inflammation on the uppermost part of the digestive track

73
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:45,239
or going down with colics or aphthae, you have that symptom, don't think of another remedy.

74
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:58,452
You have to give first this remedy. You cannot get away from the remedy. Each remedy has a very characteristic symptom.

75
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,639
I will not say symptom, you know what we call essence. Now we reduce the essence to one symptom

76
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:12,679
to make it more practical. Especially for children. Otherwise you are lost.

77
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:27,369
 If you have this, you can deal with most
of your acute cases from the telephone.

78
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:34,349
Because these things are by telephone prescription.

79
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:50,519
As you know the problem with Homeopathy is that you undertake a case chronically and then you have to treat

80
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:57,439
every little thing which is happening in the child or in the grown-up.

81
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:06,009
You have to take care of this and deal with that. It's terrible.

82
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:17,909
Because you are never paid for that. Most people they don't like, did I tell you that he had colics and you sent

83
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:21,899
this remedy and you want to be paid, what for?

84
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:42,919
Potency for all these, so far, except of Acon.  you can go higher.

85
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:56,269
I gave an example. You put the child down, never mind what it has, maybe he has aphthae

86
00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:00,019
he doesn't have to have aphthae. He may have colics.

87
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:07,359
The inflammation may not be here, it might be deeper in the digestive track, wherever it might be

88
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:14,360
in the stomach, nephritis, whatever.

89
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:32,399
Fever which is not synchronous with the pulse. What that means?

90
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:50,159
It means that when you have 39 fever, the pulse should be 110. If the fever is 39 and the pulse is 75

91
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:56,959
this is not synchronous and the remedy Pyrog.

92
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:02,359
Very good, you know everything.

93
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:31,269
When you have a child who is restless and the mother says, they like very much salt and lemon, the remedy Verat.

94
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:39,329
You don't go away from this remedy.

95
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:50,809
You may have other symptoms, here and there, some keynotes local keynotes, forget it. Just give Verat.

96
00:20:55,140 --> 00:21:03,009
Child catches his genitalia all the time? Hyos.

97
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:40,750
Tremendous distention, the child is bloated.

98
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:56,920
No gas, no burping.

99
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:18,999
Raphanus? It has to have pain for Raphanus. Pain in the left colic flexure, where it is incarcerated here and the pain is there.

100
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,610
Colchicum.

101
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:36,812
Tremendous distention of abdomen where the air does not come out, up or down, is caught inside there.

102
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:44,479
And there is dyspnea and all kinds of things. Colch.

103
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:53,239
Vomiting immediately after drinking water, Phos.

104
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:58,660
Vomiting immediately after eating.

105
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:06,789
 Ferrum metallicum.

106
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:28,549
No symptoms, you have a high fever, a tonsillitis, Ferr-p.

107
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:40,756
You see high fever, you see inflammation somewhere but the organism does not produce specific symptoms, pains.

108
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:47,919
So the mother will give you this, that's all, she has a high fever. How is he doing? He walks around.

109
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:51,119
Nothing else? No.

110
00:23:51,120 --> 00:24:00,639
He may have a pneumonia and you do not understand how the coughing is not strong yet etc.

111
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,639
Ferr-p. will cut short.

112
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:52,679
When a child wants to be caressed in the back, scratched like this, he likes it very much, that's a symptom of Sulph.

113
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:04,039
Everyone likes to be scratched in the back.

114
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:26,519
Ingrowing toenails in children, Silica.

115
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:48,809
Very offensive perspiration not only from the foot but all. The child has very offensive perspiration, not sour, offensive.

116
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:57,639
The remedy Psorinum.

117
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:12,709
If the offensive perspiration is in the feet, it's a lot of remedies; then you cannot differentiate but if the perspiration is

118
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:26,489
really offensive and the child smells badly and then you have sour perspiration, then you start to differentiate

119
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:31,479
between Calc. and Rheum.

120
00:26:51,560 --> 00:27:04,289
We can continue like this and differentiate this and that remedy and then it becomes useless because

121
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:11,929
you don't remember anything. And you say, forget it, let's go to the Repertory and start all over again.

122
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:27,539
The idea is that with this information, you will be able to handle a lot of cases, acute cases that otherwise

123
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:31,299
will require a full repertorization.

124
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:43,839
It is not good for the homeopath unless is under stress, to know the pathology and prescribe on pathology.

125
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:53,599
Because if we start differentiating in diarrhea, you will see 35-50 remedies in diarrhea. Just try to remember.

126
00:27:53,600 --> 00:28:02,787
And then you differentiate the bronchitis and the type of coughs, you try to remember. Forget it, this is not to be remembered.

127
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:11,879
These little things you can remember. Most of them you know already with the Materia Medica. You can keep them in mind.

128
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:24,439
But try to remember everything which is in the Materia Medica and in details like diarrhea or constipation

129
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:29,329
the types, forget it.

130
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:35,059
You will tire your mind and you will not be able to do good work.

131
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:48,849
I remember in one of the schools in Bombay Homeopathic College, there was a teacher

132
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:59,359
who could quote by heart the whole Materia Medica.

133
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:12,359
The students knew that if they go to be treated by him, could never find the remedy. He could not contact his brain

134
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:20,719
 and connect the information that was there
 with what he was seeing in front of him.

135
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:33,799
So you can become addicted in quoting symptoms without understanding the impact.

136
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:46,299
A good homeopath starts from basics. Learns the basics and adds with experience a little bit more, a little bit more...

137
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:57,919
And I will tell you also my experience when I started treating patients, I had 3 months of studying.

138
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:10,869
I was studying for 3 months when I first took a case and it was very successful. And then every case I took

139
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:21,809
in South Africa where I supposed to have studied all by myself, the successes it was unbelievable the success.

140
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:29,769
I can say, I lost no case. Now I can lose cases. By that time, no. Why?

141
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:39,289
Because I understood the method. I had no experience, I had no all this knowledge but I understood

142
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:46,539
what I had to do, how I had to study, how to
take a case, what was important in a case.

143
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:54,679
And I had to connect the important things, what I could see. I was observing very much every case and what is

144
00:30:54,680 --> 00:31:00,729
most important, what is stressed, then
I go and read all the Materia Medica.

145
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:07,979
This remedy stresses that point, the liver,
 she has the liver, give her Chel.

146
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:17,919
This is the idea. You cannot learn all the Materia Medica by heart, neither you should believe that anybody knows

147
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:29,929
 all the Materia Medica by heart. It's not possible. Therefore you need only a good system and study of the case.

148
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:42,399
You see we come down to Ars. when we study her case but we came down to Ars. by thinking a lot about the case.

149
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:53,679
And then Acon. and then this, that, Phos.
 and then finally something clicks.

150
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:15,399
I've told you again that in South Africa one of my first cases was a young pianist, whom I liked very much as a woman.

151
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:28,039
And I took her case and I wanted to cure her. I studied the case, no medicine. I studied the whole day

152
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:40,159
 I was studying the case repertorising this way, that way, nothing. I went to bed, I slept. Next day I woke up.

153
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:50,739
 As I woke up everything was in my brain.
The remedy is Ign.!

154
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:55,239
I gave Ign., it was beautiful cure.

155
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:05,829
I mean it was such the passion for finding the correct remedy that all the information stayed with me during sleep

156
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:10,309
 and worked through the computer.
The moment I woke up I said the remedy ...

157
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:19,559
I had studied all angles, I was not happy, I was not satisfied, this remedy, that remedy, nothing.

158
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:26,880
Suddenly it made sense, this. Give it.

159
00:33:26,881 --> 00:33:39,549
This is the idea that if you have this feeling,
 the remedy going to act. Now I got it.

160
00:33:50,010 --> 00:34:05,519
Many times this feeling has come, you have sat with a person, you have studied and you discussed

161
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:15,479
and suddenly you go out and friendly you speak and she says two things and make sense and you find the remedy.

162
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,810
It's very strange.

163
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:28,879
You have to know so much and yet the real information which you need is so little, so few.

164
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:36,660
That's why in the old times homeopaths
 they would prescribe on keynotes.

165
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:43,269
And they had successes of course.

166
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:54,479
But today the pathology is so complicated and so gone inside the mental-emotional that things are not anymore

167
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,170
 as simple as they used to be.
