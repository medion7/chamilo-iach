1
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:46,200
The Kali-ars. patient how we recognize him?

2
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:56,893
Usually are people quite
controlled, quite

3
00:00:56,906 --> 00:01:05,369
proper, quite duty bound
like all the Kalis.

4
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:13,388
You suspect very little that
these people may have an

5
00:01:13,401 --> 00:01:20,039
inner anxiety of the type
that we shall be discussing.

6
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:29,693
The anxiety is so great, anxiety
together with fear which

7
00:01:29,706 --> 00:01:39,369
mostly concerns their own
health, their own survival.

8
00:01:53,790 --> 00:02:04,143
They are critical people,
they are matter of fact in

9
00:02:04,156 --> 00:02:14,520
all respects, businessmen,
managers, industrialists,

10
00:02:14,521 --> 00:02:21,508
bank managers. This type of
people that you will not expect

11
00:02:21,521 --> 00:02:28,519
to see that tremendous fear
that arises at certain times

12
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:37,179
 where they are totally paralyzed. And
this is what makes Kali-ars. different.

13
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:42,098
Kali-ars. is a remedy
which from the pathology

14
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:47,040
point of view will be
indicated in asthma cases.

15
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,839
Because it's a remedy which is
aggravated in general during the night.

16
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:58,793
It's a remedy that would not
like to go to bed. This going to

17
00:02:58,806 --> 00:03:04,770
bed is a time of torture for Kali-ars.
whether it is anxiety

18
00:03:04,771 --> 00:03:11,809
or whether it is asthma or itching.

19
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,608
You feel that there is a
kind of malignancy which

20
00:03:18,621 --> 00:03:23,600
appears also in the physical
body as cancer of the skin

21
00:03:23,601 --> 00:03:27,189
 and more especially epithelioma.

22
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:34,603
Severe skin eruptions
especially when the eruptions

23
00:03:34,616 --> 00:03:42,040
have a dry form and severe
itching which is worse

24
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:47,839
undressing and in bed.

25
00:03:55,350 --> 00:04:02,578
They are people who will
be having tremendous fear

26
00:04:02,591 --> 00:04:09,829
most specifically fear of
having a heart attack.

27
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:30,463
It's very interesting because you
will confuse it many times with Ars.

28
00:04:30,476 --> 00:04:34,280
or with Phos., it's
very interesting that

29
00:04:34,281 --> 00:04:39,114
they need company. It says
in the Repertory or in the

30
00:04:39,127 --> 00:04:43,970
Materia Medica, they need company
and better from company.

31
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:51,050
What that means? I will
explain so you differentiate.

32
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,768
These people they can get
into panic attacks which are

33
00:04:59,781 --> 00:05:05,280
totally unbearable. It's
something beyond the physical

34
00:05:05,281 --> 00:05:10,239
something metaphysical is happening.
They don't understand what it is.

35
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,528
They cannot comprehend what
is happening inside and

36
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:20,839
they feel suddenly so much
alone, so much loneliness

37
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:28,848
 so much isolation. They
feel as if somebody has

38
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:36,880
died and has become totally
isolated and fearful.

39
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:42,013
At that moment they
need communication,

40
00:05:42,026 --> 00:05:46,409
they need to start
talking with somebody.

41
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,528
These people will get in the
middle of the night, two

42
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:57,239
o'clock, with a panic attack.
What is happening? I'm dying.

43
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,688
And they have to speak to
somebody and they pick up the

44
00:06:00,701 --> 00:06:04,160
telephone and they telephone to
their mother or their father

45
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:11,199
to their friend or somebody just to be
talking, to make sure they are alive.

46
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:16,353
The panic is so much, I'm
dying, I'm going to die, as

47
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:21,530
long as I talk I'm not going
to die and this is the idea

48
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:29,999
better with company and
worse when they are alone.

49
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:36,800
They are serious people with
a tendency to depression.

50
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:41,728
They are critical and
suspicious, they are not

51
00:06:41,741 --> 00:06:46,679
open people that they
will give out themselves.

52
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:53,488
They rather take but take
is not like the Phos.

53
00:06:53,501 --> 00:07:00,320
idea of communication.

54
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,478
These people don't need
to communicate their

55
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:07,859
real feelings, they just
need to communicate.

56
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:14,940
Just to have somebody to talk, it doesn't
matter what, as long as they talk.

57
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:28,509
You understand that talking is under
 this condition of fear and anxiety.

58
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,719
-I want to know if talking
is similar to Lach.?

59
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:43,018
-No, no. Lach. also we say they
go to bed and they feel in hell.

60
00:07:43,031 --> 00:07:50,020
When? In the beginning
when they cough

61
00:07:50,021 --> 00:07:53,108
and they have dyspnoea, they
suffer, then they go to sleep.

62
00:07:53,121 --> 00:07:56,219
Then they wake up in the
morning and they are again

63
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:02,418
 in a kind of aggravation state.
These people they can

64
00:08:02,431 --> 00:08:08,639
sleep for a while but then
they wake up at 2,3,4 o'clock

65
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,818
 and that is the time mostly
of the aggravation. This

66
00:08:12,831 --> 00:08:17,020
is the time when they may
get the panic attacks.

67
00:08:17,021 --> 00:08:22,599
During the night especially
when they live alone.

68
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:30,599
They are people who usually do
not have strong family ties.

69
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:39,978
They support the family but
the emotional part is rather

70
00:08:39,991 --> 00:08:46,870
cold; that's why they are
very critical of everything

71
00:08:46,871 --> 00:08:50,283
and that's why they
get easily very

72
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:53,719
suspicious and then they
go into depression.

73
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:02,488
If they suspect that his wife
maybe is looking somebody,

74
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:09,720
they get jealous without
expressing the jealousy.

75
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:13,579
Instead they become depressed.

76
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:21,613
Jealousy which has as an
immediate reaction not fighting

77
00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:28,599
but depression it has to
bring to the mind, Kali-ars.

78
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:37,933
So Kali-ars. is an
anxious, restless and

79
00:09:37,946 --> 00:09:47,289
nervous and sleeplessness
and panics and fear.

80
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:55,580
Fear of something unknown,
they cannot put down exactly.

81
00:09:55,581 --> 00:10:02,758
But as you have this patient
maybe you don't find the

82
00:10:02,771 --> 00:10:09,959
remedy in the beginning, they
will bother you quite a lot

83
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,728
 because of the heaviness.
This is depression,

84
00:10:14,741 --> 00:10:19,520
together with anxiety,
together with fear.

85
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:27,069
It's not a light anxiety, they talk about.
They don't want to talk about.

86
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:30,473
They call the friend, they
call the mother, they

87
00:10:30,486 --> 00:10:33,899
call the father, nobody
must know what's going on.

88
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:38,508
That I have such a
tremendous fear which

89
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:42,390
eventually crystallizes
in fear of heart attack.

90
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:47,740
They don't want that others will know.

91
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:09,160
In later stages they can become
indifferent, depressed...

92
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,188
...and a kind of idiocy,
it's not exactly the word.

93
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,473
They can be in a state of
Alzheimer eventually. The

94
00:11:32,486 --> 00:11:37,490
sleeplessness and the restlessness
which is going on for years

95
00:11:37,491 --> 00:11:42,363
 plus the anxiety and the
tremendous fear eventually

96
00:11:42,376 --> 00:11:47,259
brings down the breaking
down of the mind

97
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:53,458
which eventually starts
losing the memory

98
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:59,680
and goes slowly into
this anoea (dementia).

99
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:17,448
Also they are people who are
not hopeful, they will usually

100
00:12:17,461 --> 00:12:24,700
express this despair that there
is no way that I can be well.

101
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:28,989
There is nobody really that can help me.

102
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:40,059
I will give you some example
also of how they behave.

103
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:48,308
You see a very logical man, a
very compact, you don't see

104
00:12:48,321 --> 00:12:55,190
somebody who is uneducated
and yet the panic is so much

105
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:59,989
that 'now I have this, heart
attack, now I have that'.

106
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:06,233
They have to go to the specialist.
They will not say to the

107
00:13:06,246 --> 00:13:12,199
mother, father 'I'm going to
have a heart attack', no.

108
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,133
They will go to the specialist
and say, 'please have a look,

109
00:13:18,146 --> 00:13:23,090
I feel the pain'. They create
the pain out of anxiety

110
00:13:23,091 --> 00:13:27,603
and they have some pain and
the cardiologist usually

111
00:13:27,616 --> 00:13:32,138
to whom they go makes a
cardiogram and says nothing.

112
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,153
 It's the people with the most
cardiograms in their hands. When

113
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:41,209
they come to you they will come
with a series of cardiograms.

114
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:50,209
Usually from one cardiologist
whom they trust.

115
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,213
I remember a case who
said to him, he said

116
00:13:56,226 --> 00:14:00,730
listen you are a busy
man, I'm not so busy man.

117
00:14:00,731 --> 00:14:08,599
You've come so many times, you gave me
so much money, you wasted your money OK.

118
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,868
So I'll make a proposal to you.
That every month you will send

119
00:14:13,881 --> 00:14:19,160
me a check and every month I
will send you a certification

120
00:14:19,161 --> 00:14:23,788
 that your heart is all right.
You don't have to come

121
00:14:23,801 --> 00:14:28,439
so you don't waste your
time but you will be happy

122
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:33,548
and I will be happy also.
I told you so

123
00:14:33,561 --> 00:14:38,679
many times your heart
is OK and no problem.

124
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,888
It was very strange that
this particular man

125
00:14:44,901 --> 00:14:49,639
after treating him went
out of Kali-ars. state.

126
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:56,578
He telephoned one day,
he says 'George do you

127
00:14:56,591 --> 00:15:02,319
remember me?' I said yes.
It was 15 years later.

128
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:08,608
He said, 'who am I?' I said, this is you.
He says, 'I

129
00:15:08,621 --> 00:15:14,919
want to tell you something.
I had a heart attack'.

130
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:26,943
The most strange thing you
remember he was afraid all these

131
00:15:26,956 --> 00:15:32,479
years, now I had a heart
attack and I was not afraid.

132
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:43,708
He was amazed, I could
remember even his name and

133
00:15:43,721 --> 00:15:49,180
his case of course. His
case was a very strong case

134
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:54,353
because this man was so strong,
so powerful. I remember

135
00:15:54,366 --> 00:15:59,549
in the waiting room they were
several individuals sitting

136
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:02,333
 and several doctors working
in different rooms and I

137
00:16:02,346 --> 00:16:05,139
was passing, going from one
room to another to see

138
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,839
the next consultation which I had to form.

139
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:18,438
And at a certain moment I
felt almost a power behind me

140
00:16:18,451 --> 00:16:24,059
and I turn and I look at this
man and then I go inside.

141
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:33,928
And of course he got inside
and I see his name and in his

142
00:16:33,941 --> 00:16:43,820
name, he was coming from NY
this man but he was Greek

143
00:16:43,821 --> 00:16:52,588
but living in NY and in his
name the man who brought

144
00:16:52,601 --> 00:17:01,379
him said, be careful
he belongs to the CIA.

145
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:11,693
So I look at the paper and
say, oh it's you. Then he had

146
00:17:11,706 --> 00:17:20,280
no problem, he told me. He
said, I did everything in life

147
00:17:20,281 --> 00:17:25,049
I wanted to become rich,
I became rich. I was

148
00:17:25,062 --> 00:17:29,840
in the American army, I
did this, I did that.

149
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:37,278
 I have not been able to beat Valium.
I have to take

150
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:43,019
constantly Valium to keep
out of these panic attacks.

151
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:52,773
So this kind of hard man you
don't expect that they will

152
00:17:52,786 --> 00:18:00,489
have such a deep anxiety, fear
and almost metaphysical fear.

153
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:05,928
It is like disintegration.
Actually his son after

154
00:18:05,941 --> 00:18:11,390
a few years he came to me
with similar symptoms.

155
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:16,679
His son did not know why
his father was coming.

156
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:28,199
The father never told the son and the
son was with almost identical symptoms.

157
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,488
Also Kali-ars. acted
beautifully many many

158
00:18:38,501 --> 00:18:44,119
years till the son did
not bother me anymore.

159
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:55,399
But these cases are really the
most heavy panic states cases.

160
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:14,528
-Will you be surprised that
this guy had a heart attack

161
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:18,799
or what is the kind of
realization of internal fear?

162
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,428
 I mean do you think that
it should be a connection

163
00:19:22,441 --> 00:19:26,080
or is something which we
should be surprised of?

164
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:34,553
-Don't forget this man was very rich.
As I said, he

165
00:19:34,566 --> 00:19:39,330
was going to the cardiologist
every week for years.

166
00:19:39,331 --> 00:19:43,419
At least one time the week he was to the
cardiologist making a cardiogram etc.

167
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:48,003
He had visited the best
doctors all over the world.

168
00:19:48,016 --> 00:19:52,180
He followed the advice of
many different people.

169
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:57,399
Finally he ended up taking
Valium 3 times the day.

170
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,868
The problem was the anxiety.
After the anxiety was

171
00:20:03,881 --> 00:20:07,759
finished, he did not bother
to come from NY anymore.

172
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,410
He was going for different ailments.

173
00:20:10,411 --> 00:20:17,738
For a flu he would go to
the local doctor, for

174
00:20:17,751 --> 00:20:25,089
15 years I did not know
what he was doing.

175
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:31,280
The interesting thing was when he
phoned me, he said 'I am this man'

176
00:20:31,281 --> 00:20:35,668
and what impressed him
he said, 'I went to the

177
00:20:35,681 --> 00:20:40,079
hospital with a heart attack
and I was not afraid'.

178
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,133
He was amazed himself what
I've given him during

179
00:20:46,146 --> 00:20:50,690
that time which made him so
well that even if he had

180
00:20:50,691 --> 00:20:57,239
 a real heart attack, he was not afraid.
 It's a different level all together.

181
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:01,533
But I cannot know, let us
say the question may be:

182
00:21:01,546 --> 00:21:05,279
if he had followed all
these years homeopathic

183
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:11,868
 treatment, would he have a heart attack?
That is a good question.

184
00:21:11,881 --> 00:21:18,480
I believe no, but
nobody can prove this.

185
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:30,628
-We can give Kali-ars.
to a person who has

186
00:21:30,641 --> 00:21:35,239
frequently extrasystolism,
palpitation?

187
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:42,608
-Yes as long as the aggravation
is in the night. If he wakes

188
00:21:42,621 --> 00:21:50,000
up in the night, if he is worse
with cold, Kali-ars. also

189
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,408
 has cold extremities like Verat.
It is one of the

190
00:21:54,421 --> 00:21:58,399
remedies that will be indicated
to Raynaud's syndrome

191
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:07,719
as long as he has this kind of
character, closed, not communicative.

192
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:21,298
There is a kind of inner
connection in the building of a

193
00:22:21,311 --> 00:22:28,799
remedy and the connection
is this: you have malignant

194
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:35,808
anxiety which will end in a
malignancy like epithelioma

195
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:42,839
in a case where the heart
is suffering quite a lot.

196
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:47,223
That is why they get this
tremendous fear about their

197
00:22:47,236 --> 00:22:51,629
heart because the heart suffers
for different reasons.

198
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:57,378
In this particular case suffers
because it does not have the

199
00:22:57,391 --> 00:23:03,149
possibility to communicate
with his wife, to communicate

200
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:11,573
 with his children. He says,
my son does not understand me.

201
00:23:11,586 --> 00:23:20,020
I am rich, I have a
big shop in NY center

202
00:23:20,021 --> 00:23:26,289
he doesn't walk to take the shop.
This is unbelievable for me.

203
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:35,533
So this kind of man who has
no particular feelings if

204
00:23:35,546 --> 00:23:43,809
the feelings go down and
then up comes the anxiety

205
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:53,199
and the restlessness this is
heading for a big problem.

206
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:05,119
-If we give this remedy in heart
problems, we can give high potency?

207
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:12,383
-Up to 200 you can give. It depends also.
Extrasystole

208
00:24:12,396 --> 00:24:19,670
may mean nothing. It's only
an electrical disturbance

209
00:24:19,671 --> 00:24:25,984
but it might mean consequence of
other more serious conditions

210
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:32,320
in which case you have to be
a little bit more careful.

211
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:42,848
This man is very strange.
Still he calls me once a

212
00:24:42,861 --> 00:24:48,239
year or every second year
just to say 'how are you

213
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,368
when are you coming to visit
me' and things like that. He

214
00:24:53,381 --> 00:24:58,520
has no need for remedy. That
means his needs are covered

215
00:24:58,521 --> 00:25:04,129
by local doctors. He did not understand.

216
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,553
He came the first interview,
the first follow up,

217
00:25:11,566 --> 00:25:16,009
he came and I said, how are you?
He was very hard.

218
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:24,758
You felt nothing? 'Nothing'.
One month, 'nothing I

219
00:25:24,771 --> 00:25:31,519
didn't feel anything. What can I do?'.
This attitude.

220
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:38,329
Then you are in a problem because you
say the remedy has acted or not?

221
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:46,299
I said OK, I'll give you another remedy.
Take some placebo.

222
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:57,799
Second month, a little
doubt, is it possible?

223
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,948
 After going to all these
doctors I come to this

224
00:26:01,961 --> 00:26:06,119
little man here, I'm talking
about 30 years ago.

225
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:12,753
This young man sitting there in
a basement in Athens, I have

226
00:26:12,766 --> 00:26:19,410
travelled all over and is it
possible that I will be cured

227
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:27,559
by this one? I could see the whole thing
because his thought was so strong.

228
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:34,663
Don't forget I turn around to
see who is grabbing me? It was

229
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:41,790
like somebody who most probably
is very willing to be well

230
00:26:41,791 --> 00:26:44,990
 he says this is the master.
He looked at

231
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:48,212
me and the vibration
made me turn around.

232
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:59,103
And when the third month
he came with a ring,

233
00:26:59,116 --> 00:27:05,689
I remember I told you,
for my wife, he said

234
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:09,929
 'I'm a free man, you made me a free man'.

235
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:16,468
He also said this famous, 'if
anybody ever tries to do something

236
00:27:16,481 --> 00:27:23,029
wrong with you, you call me
and I will come with a gun'.

237
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:33,399
-The pharmaceutical companies?

238
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:40,963
-First I have to know who is the one.
To kill all the

239
00:27:40,976 --> 00:27:47,079
pharmaceutical companies, that
would be very interesting.

240
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:56,808
But this shows the character,
how suspicious, in the

241
00:27:56,821 --> 00:28:02,919
Repertory you read suspicious.
Unless you understand

242
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:08,533
the kind of suspiciousness,
it's somebody who is critical

243
00:28:08,546 --> 00:28:14,169
and suspicious, thinks a
lot, doesn't go along with

244
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:19,253
what you tell him, he has
to decide for himself.

245
00:28:19,266 --> 00:28:24,360
This is the type of Kali-ars.
people.

246
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:53,359
Let's talk about another remedy, Sabin.

247
00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:08,373
Sabin. we know it mostly as
a remedy for women with the

248
00:29:08,386 --> 00:29:20,279
problems centralizing upon
the reproductive organs.

249
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:28,280
The reproductive organs are in disorder.

250
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:39,768
 Where we have tremendous
hemorrhages with big black

251
00:29:39,781 --> 00:29:47,289
clots, the woman hemorrhages
(bleeds) almost constantly.

252
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:53,538
And it is many times a dangerous
situation when they come

253
00:29:53,551 --> 00:29:58,639
to you because these hemorrhages
don't stop easily at all.

254
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,970
Of course they have easy miscarriages.

255
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:24,733
But what I want to discuss
mostly is the type of woman

256
00:30:24,746 --> 00:30:30,169
who has these uterine
problems or sexual problems.

257
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:43,990
These usually are women who are closed,
not communicative, not social ...

258
00:30:43,991 --> 00:30:54,803
 ...with a passionate nature,
sexually passionate.

259
00:30:54,816 --> 00:31:05,639
They have strong sexual
desire, strong passions.

260
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:17,008
They feel lascivious, they like
different things and going

261
00:31:17,021 --> 00:31:23,920
with different men but their
character prevents them

262
00:31:23,921 --> 00:31:32,569
from becoming common women
almost, going with any man.

263
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:40,989
So they are women who can even
reach the state of nymphomania.

264
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:00,063
Usually you will confuse them with Nat-m.
because they are

265
00:32:00,076 --> 00:32:04,909
closed, discontented, they don't
talk about their feelings.

266
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:12,138
If you try to pacify them, if you
try to console them, they don't

267
00:32:12,151 --> 00:32:19,389
like it, they are aggravated
from consolation, like Nat-m.

268
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:48,758
And due to this fact that
they can communicate very

269
00:32:48,771 --> 00:32:56,899
difficult, they have a feeling
of being forsaken by others.

270
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:05,813
This feeling can be expressed and
you may be thinking of Puls.

271
00:33:05,826 --> 00:33:12,810
because they are better
from cool and fresh air

272
00:33:12,811 --> 00:33:19,379
and they are worse from warm, like Puls.

273
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:28,960
They don't cry easily but
they cry in their sleep.

274
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:34,838
All the grief they keep
it comes out during

275
00:33:34,851 --> 00:33:39,689
sleep where they may
be start crying.

276
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:49,808
It's very interesting also
it is a remedy that does not

277
00:33:49,821 --> 00:33:55,040
like to listen to music. Music
strikes some chord inside

278
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:59,898
 that aggravates them and
brings them to the point

279
00:33:59,911 --> 00:34:04,779
where they want to cry
and they don't like it.

280
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:10,619
Like Nat-m. don't like to
cry in front of others.

281
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:19,943
But once they get very angry
they can explode and then

282
00:34:19,956 --> 00:34:27,239
they end up in sobbing,
after exploding in anger.

283
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:40,553
They are people who will not talk
very much, they don't like to

284
00:34:40,566 --> 00:34:45,869
talk, they don't like to communicate
but they talk in sleep.

285
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:58,488
You see actually in them
the idea of emotionally

286
00:34:58,501 --> 00:35:06,320
loaded individual who
cannot express this passion

287
00:35:06,321 --> 00:35:16,969
 this intensity in normal life and the
activity takes place during sleep.

288
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:40,558
Kali-ars. we said avoids going to bed.
The Sabin. is

289
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:47,759
tired and looks for the bed
and looks for solitude.

290
00:35:52,200 --> 00:36:03,333
In this respect will look again like Nat-m.
You see again how

291
00:36:03,346 --> 00:36:14,489
closed it is but she is not hurt,
she is closed but not hurt.

292
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:25,689
Nat-m. closes because there is a
trauma, a pain in the psyche.

293
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:32,938
They are closed and not
communicative, don't like to

294
00:36:32,951 --> 00:36:38,210
talk, like to stay by
themselves, like to stay alone

295
00:36:38,211 --> 00:36:41,343
but the night there is activity.
They can

296
00:36:41,356 --> 00:36:44,499
talk, they can cry,
they can do anything.

297
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:55,868
And due to this hormonal
disturbance which brings about

298
00:36:55,881 --> 00:37:01,480
the excessive sexual desire,
you see the activity

299
00:37:01,481 --> 00:37:10,869
 in the uterus where the blood flows
and black pieces are coming out.

300
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:18,433
You see also the inability of
the uterus to hold the fetus

301
00:37:18,446 --> 00:37:26,019
and you have miscarriages,
especially in the third month.

302
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:50,333
And the characteristic
pain is this pain which is

303
00:37:50,346 --> 00:37:54,560
from the sacrum to the pubis,
there is almost a line.

304
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:08,149
They will describe the pain absolutely
like this, and this is Sabin. 95%.

305
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:15,870
If they specify that pain and
you see the metrorrhagia.

306
00:38:15,871 --> 00:38:22,829
 The woman has come usually in
due to stop the metrorrhagias.

307
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:34,923
We have a case on video, Sabin.
on video on the other group,

308
00:38:34,936 --> 00:38:44,070
very interesting case. Maybe
later on in future seminars.

309
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:51,133
Where we have to present
cases, I will show

310
00:38:51,146 --> 00:38:55,529
this case because it's
very typical Sabin.

311
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:08,553
That's all you have to remember.
Miscarriages,

312
00:39:08,566 --> 00:39:13,789
uterine with a lot of
blood, blood with clots.

313
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:28,529
How many of you have prescribed Sabin.
so far?

314
00:39:53,390 --> 00:40:00,013
In Sabin. we see two things.
The menses are very

315
00:40:00,026 --> 00:40:06,659
profuse, long, protracted
and with black clots.

316
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:12,098
At the same time in other
cases we see really bleeding

317
00:40:12,111 --> 00:40:16,900
all along, bleeding which
stops for 2-3 days and then

318
00:40:16,901 --> 00:40:22,558
 again starts and continues
and it has this heaviness

319
00:40:22,571 --> 00:40:28,239
and dangerous. You feel
that she is going anemic

320
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:33,108
 she is losing so much blood,
that's why she is in danger.

321
00:40:33,121 --> 00:40:37,999
Sometimes you will
see fever arising.

322
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:44,628
But the bleeding is heavy
always whether it is within

323
00:40:44,641 --> 00:40:50,240
the menses or whether it
is because of a tumor

324
00:40:50,241 --> 00:41:02,760
 of a myoma, polypus or because
of malfunction of the uterus.

325
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:10,658
-I have a question not so much about Sabin.
Many remedies

326
00:41:10,671 --> 00:41:15,479
in Materia Medica are
coming up regarding music.

327
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:19,668
Given the nature of when
Homeopathy developed

328
00:41:19,681 --> 00:41:22,350
and started where many
provings were made

329
00:41:22,351 --> 00:41:25,313
the music that was
available then is very

330
00:41:25,326 --> 00:41:28,299
different than the music
it is available now.

331
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:32,908
I found that some of the Repertory
information is not really

332
00:41:32,921 --> 00:41:37,539
accurate and I just wondered
if you comment about that?

333
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:46,128
-That is true but when we
refer to this sensitivity, it

334
00:41:46,141 --> 00:41:52,440
has to be really strong, that
means you suspect Sabin.

335
00:41:52,441 --> 00:41:57,839
 and you ask do you enjoy music?
She says no.

336
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:04,840
Straight forward. I even don't listen.
This is the answer.

337
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:10,953
 When you get such an answer,
no individual will give this

338
00:42:10,966 --> 00:42:16,720
answer even if they are unmusical,
even if they don't listen

339
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:23,158
 If they listen by chance they don't mind.
They mind the noise.

340
00:42:23,171 --> 00:42:28,630
It seems that there is a kind
of sensitivity in the ear

341
00:42:28,631 --> 00:42:34,083
and if the noise is
strong, then it seems to

342
00:42:34,096 --> 00:42:39,559
penetrate the whole organism.
It is similar to Ther.

343
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:46,888
Ther. also cannot tolerate
this noise and they feel it

344
00:42:46,901 --> 00:42:54,239
in their body, as pain. But
here music is rhythmic.

345
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:59,173
And this is strange, the Ther.
does not have this

346
00:42:59,186 --> 00:43:04,129
sensitivity to music; it has
sensitivity to noise and Asar.

347
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:13,558
which is even worse in the
reaction towards the noise,

348
00:43:13,571 --> 00:43:23,009
will plug their ears but not in music.
They like music.

349
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:30,443
But any kind of noise
and especially the

350
00:43:30,456 --> 00:43:36,599
squeaky noise when we
write with the chalk.

351
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:46,453
-Concerning Sabin., the
duration of bleeding after what

352
00:43:46,466 --> 00:43:49,590
time you would expect that Sabin.
could stop bleeding?

353
00:43:49,591 --> 00:43:53,519
 How long would you have to wait?

354
00:43:53,920 --> 00:44:00,833
-It depends. If she comes for
profuse menses, not real bleeding,

355
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:07,769
then you can wait 2-3 months
to see if it's regulating.

356
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:12,288
But if she comes with
profuse, pathological

357
00:44:12,301 --> 00:44:16,830
bleeding then you have
to wait a few days only.

358
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:21,399
In few days you have to see the reduction.

359
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:37,858
You can give high potencies,
they act more quickly,

360
00:44:37,871 --> 00:44:41,370
especially in such bleeding
which I'm talking about

361
00:44:41,371 --> 00:44:50,729
 you have to give 1M, 10M, 50M
unless you have a cancer of course.

362
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:55,209
If you have a cancer in the uterus
which is bleeding is different.

363
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:29,239
Anybody else had a typical Sabin.
case, do you remember?

364
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:38,433
-I heard about women that
make experiments with Sabin.

365
00:45:38,446 --> 00:45:46,199
in different potencies to
bring about a miscarriage.

366
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:54,199
-Did they succeed?

367
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:02,399
-Partly.

368
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:07,760
-It's very strange.

369
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:22,398
You see in order to bring
a miscarriage, let's talk

370
00:46:22,411 --> 00:46:29,309
clear, you have different
vibrational frequencies.

371
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:37,959
 Here is Sep., Sabin., Nat-m., Ign. etc.

372
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:49,973
The subject, the woman has to be very near.
If she is Sabin.

373
00:46:49,986 --> 00:46:55,150
she will be cured, not only
she will not have miscarriage

374
00:46:55,151 --> 00:46:59,279
 but in case she was going to have a
miscarriage, she will not have it.

375
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:05,678
So this case is out, is cured.
In order to have really such

376
00:47:05,691 --> 00:47:12,100
an effect, has to be really the
next vibrational frequency.

377
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:16,363
That means you catch
somebody who is very

378
00:47:16,376 --> 00:47:20,239
sensitive to Sabin. without
being Sabin. exactly.

379
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:26,873
In such case there might be a
possibility, if you take Sabin.

380
00:47:26,886 --> 00:47:33,529
low potency, frequently, maybe.

381
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:50,439
But if somebody's remedy is here and Sabin.
is here, it will have no effect.

382
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:57,933
-I have a young woman and she
had 3 times a miscarriage.

383
00:47:57,946 --> 00:48:02,200
In the end of 2nd
beggining of 3rd month.

384
00:48:02,201 --> 00:48:04,588
And when she had the
fourth pregnancy, at

385
00:48:04,601 --> 00:48:06,999
that time I worked
with low potencies.

386
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:13,760
But I told her to take Sabin. C30
once the week and she kept the child.

387
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:20,739
She said that the uterus did not
have the force to keep the child.

388
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:33,580
- I have a case too which proves that
Homeopathy is not placebo effect.

389
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:42,733
One day a woman calls me
that she has dog and this

390
00:48:42,746 --> 00:48:46,320
dog has got puppies and
since it has delivered

391
00:48:46,321 --> 00:48:53,999
 the dog has constant bleedings and
the doctor wanted to do hysterectomy.

392
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,198
I didn't see the dog but another
prominent thing the woman told

393
00:48:58,211 --> 00:49:02,419
me is that since this time the
dog was very sensitive to touch.

394
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:11,279
Sabin. helped up to now,
this dog to have puppies.

395
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:23,513
-Very good. It is also
interesting for us that we study

396
00:49:23,526 --> 00:49:32,290
in such detail the human
imbalances, is very interesting

397
00:49:32,291 --> 00:49:36,703
that if you go in the
Repertory, if I remember well,

398
00:49:36,716 --> 00:49:41,139
you will see another remedy
which has blood with clots

399
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:48,439
 which is again Platina, which
is again a very sexual remedy.

400
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:08,978
What has to do the
sexuality or the non

401
00:50:08,991 --> 00:50:16,939
satisfaction in sexual
matters with blood clots?

402
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:33,398
You see how the disorganisation
of the organism is pointing

403
00:50:33,411 --> 00:50:42,559
out certain indications where
it might be the problem.

404
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:51,959
But this is how also we learn about
the inner structure of human beings.

405
00:50:56,060 --> 00:51:01,053
Not everyone will be like that
but you ask, she says very

406
00:51:01,066 --> 00:51:06,069
profuse, with black clots.
Most probably this is a case

407
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:11,983
 of a dissatisfaction in sexual energy.
The sexual

408
00:51:11,996 --> 00:51:17,919
energy is strong and there
is an inner dissatisfaction.

409
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:28,253
These women they
have sex but no real

410
00:51:28,266 --> 00:51:36,510
satisfaction, they don't
end up into real orgasm.

411
00:51:36,511 --> 00:51:44,143
They end up into something
else which is more or less but

412
00:51:44,156 --> 00:51:51,799
they are very excited and there
is no end to their desire.

413
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:57,723
The desire remains. When
there is real orgasm, the

414
00:51:57,736 --> 00:52:03,669
desire goes away for a
period of time at least.

415
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:14,679
With Sabin., with Plat., with Orig. we
don't see that kind of satisfaction.

416
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:22,139
We see the excitement and no satisfaction.

417
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:35,828
Also the mind of Sabin. is
many times a confused mind, a

418
00:52:35,841 --> 00:52:43,560
mind as if there is intoxication,
there is sluggishness

419
00:52:44,590 --> 00:52:53,303
 a kind of fog with
aversion to do mental work.

420
00:52:53,316 --> 00:53:02,039
They are ready to do other
work but not mental.

421
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:12,948
Therefore their memory drops
quite early and we have

422
00:53:12,961 --> 00:53:19,040
disturbances of memory,
disturbances of concentration

423
00:53:19,041 --> 00:53:25,268
disturbances of interest in
professional life, if it

424
00:53:25,281 --> 00:53:31,519
is a profession that needs
the function of the mind.

425
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:47,358
So you see to bring an individual
into real balance, mental,

426
00:53:47,371 --> 00:53:54,540
emotional and physical, here
you see the over activity

427
00:53:54,541 --> 00:54:05,639
in the reproductive system and
slowing down of the mental activity.

428
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:12,499
You see the feelings are strong but
kept inside, not communicative.

429
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:26,568
And you see the outlet
of all disturbance as a

430
00:54:26,581 --> 00:54:34,769
flow of blood, it's
tremendous and the black.

431
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:47,769
- Under 'male, ganitalia, increased
desire' you have Sabin. in second degree.

432
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:54,163
-I don't remember now.
What I remember definitely

433
00:54:54,176 --> 00:54:58,920
is that I had a lot of
cases of female Sabin.

434
00:54:58,921 --> 00:55:07,179
but what we said except
of the uterine bleeding,

435
00:55:07,192 --> 00:55:15,460
all the rest can be applied
to men who are closed

436
00:55:15,461 --> 00:55:21,413
 full of feelings inside but
not being able to express

437
00:55:21,426 --> 00:55:27,389
these feelings. This
activity takes place during

438
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:33,888
 the sleeping time where
they talk, they cry, they

439
00:55:33,901 --> 00:55:39,439
perform and all that and
the increased desire.

440
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:46,058
-I would like to ask a question about Nat-m.
Because we are

441
00:55:46,071 --> 00:55:50,100
comparing certain aspects, the
closeness and everything.

442
00:55:50,101 --> 00:55:57,569
What about the sexual desire, is it strong
in Nat-m., you have seen that often?

443
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:07,018
-The Nat-m. because of
lack of communication they

444
00:56:07,031 --> 00:56:13,719
keep inside and they don't
express, they don't go out

445
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:20,158
and seek partners. Therefore
the desire is very strong and

446
00:56:20,171 --> 00:56:26,619
when they come into contact,
this desire is detonated.

447
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:37,040
But there is satisfaction, there is no
the nymphomania, one after the other.

448
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:41,559
 There is satisfaction,
they become very sexual.

449
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:50,613
In their expression, once
they let themselves they can

450
00:56:50,626 --> 00:56:56,639
become very expressive and very
sexual but with an orgasm.

451
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:02,123
If this closes, in Nat-m.
it can go deeper and closes

452
00:57:02,136 --> 00:57:07,630
this function, then comes the
depression which is deep

453
00:57:07,631 --> 00:57:16,479
 and they are indifferent and unable
to have excitement, enjoyment.

454
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:22,048
The Sabin., the Platina have enjoyment.
They don't reach

455
00:57:22,061 --> 00:57:27,639
that peak of enjoyment which
releases the organism.

456
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:33,668
It seems to take away, there is a
production of certain hormones

457
00:57:33,681 --> 00:57:39,719
in the system, male or female
which have to be neutralized.

458
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:42,828
I don't know how the
mechanism exactly. They

459
00:57:42,841 --> 00:57:45,959
have to be neutralized
by what we call orgasm.

460
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:55,773
In Sabin. and in Gamb.,
in Orig., in Plat.,

461
00:57:55,786 --> 00:58:02,770
they don't reach that satisfaction.
Nat-m. yes.

462
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:08,593
 Closed, feelings are there, not
expressed yes, worse consolation

463
00:58:08,606 --> 00:58:14,439
yes, but in the sexual sphere
if they let themselves.

464
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:19,228
Because a Nat-m. woman can
be approached by 10 men,

465
00:58:19,241 --> 00:58:24,040
she will pick only one and
maybe none of the 10.

466
00:58:24,041 --> 00:58:27,623
She says I don't like
them, next year, next

467
00:58:27,636 --> 00:58:31,229
time we'll see. They
retain themselves.

468
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:36,989
 The Sabin. is not selective.

469
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:44,080
So all these of course differentiate
the one from the other.
