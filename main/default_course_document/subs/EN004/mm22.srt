1
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:43,159
So we have another case who is afraid of snakes. Fear of snakes here is the primary symptom.

2
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:57,239
 Lac-c. has fear of snakes. Most probably the dogs are afraid of snakes too much.

3
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:19,999
Fear of snakes here is a pathology. Who is afraid of snakes? All the others are not?

4
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,399
I'm going to bring a snake tomorrow and see what happens.

5
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:40,099
Everybody is afraid of snakes but we don't imagine that a snake might be here. A Lac-c. will come in here

6
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:48,459
and will think maybe the snake is underneath. Or the snake is in the bed.

7
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:04,930
I remember when I was in India with Krishnamurti, he was talking about fear. He was analyzing fear.

8
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:22,019
It was a children's class and I remember one boy was in the class, hearing about fear. So he asks for a question.

9
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:34,319
He says, 'Sir what are you doing if you feel everywhere there are snakes?'

10
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:51,369
He told me 'this is a case for you. Can you do something?' I said, 'yes we can do something'.

11
00:02:51,370 --> 00:03:02,629
This kind of fear, the boy was terrified, 'I see everywhere snakes. In my imagination, in the bed'.

12
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:14,279
Fear of snakes. Lach. also has dreams of snakes, fear of snakes but not to that degree.

13
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:33,329
And the other great symptom of Lac-c. is when you see symptoms going from left to right, you think it's Lach.

14
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:43,399
But then it comes back to left. Then it's Lac-c. Or it is from right to left, you think it's Lyc. but then

15
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,399
 it goes back to the right, then it's Lac-c.

16
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:26,649
You get a tumor on the right breast and then it goes to the left; either operated or even subsides on the right side

17
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:32,559
and it appears on the left. You are thinking of Lyc., right to left.

18
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:42,299
Then in no time this is back. The same with headaches. Headache that starts on the right side, then the next day

19
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:47,549
is on the left side. Then 2 days is back on the right side.

20
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:53,889
That is very characteristic of Lac-c.

21
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:21,469
You will get a tonsillitis left. Then right, then back to left. That's the time you think of Lac-c.

22
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:38,649
Also glazed surfaces of mucus membranes, diphtheria like.

23
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:50,779
We have not cases of diphtheria. Actually I have not seen any case of real diphtheria but I have seen cases

24
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:59,379
quite severe that they look like diphtheria. With high fever and then they are covered with some membranes.

25
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:07,209
You see the white and then of course it comes back and forth.

26
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:41,239
Lac-c. has the opposite of Lach. It's rather low blood pressure with a feeling as if it's not touching the ground.

27
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:52,329
There is a kind of a vertigo which the person feels as if I'm floating and then I'm going to faint.

28
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:08,099
And fear of fainting can develop very strongly and they get fear of dying and fear of fainting.

29
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:21,579
Fear of going out of their body. It is similar to Cann-i., similar to Agar. also.

30
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:48,649
The best cures you will do is when you will find a person who desires very much salt, strong desire for salt

31
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:53,409
but even stronger desire for pepper.

32
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:09,679
And when I say desire for pepper, you know the red chillis? If you touch them, unless if you are Indian

33
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:28,880
if you touch them and just make a little bite like that. I was in India and I did not know that trick. I died by touching it.

34
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:35,559
You get the Lac-c. cases and they say, give that to me.

35
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:48,789
I say, 'no you cannot do it'. It was a woman, I challenged her. She said, 'give it to me' and she ate the whole thing.

36
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:52,249
 I couldn't believe it. I said now I know your remedy.

37
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:40,929
She came to be treated my me, I'm talking about 1970, and she was in a terrible state. I saw her and I said

38
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:46,349
'are you taking drugs?', 'Yes'. She was taking different drugs and she was in that terrible state.

39
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:57,099
I said, forget it I cannot treat you. She stopped the medication and she came back. And I treated her for years.

40
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:13,849
Actually this was a case of Lac-c. which I have missed it for many many years. And it was when she bite this pepper

41
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:21,500
I said my God this is a case of Lac-c. I gave her and beautiful.

42
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:32,809
But the original symptoms were treated with Phos., Sep., from time to time I would give different remedies

43
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:39,130
and I kept her satisfied.

44
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:44,479
Desires salt and desires pepper. Red pepper.

45
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,239
-You are talking about chili pepper?

46
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:04,410
-Yes chili, not the pepper which is not hot. It has to be hot, burning.

47
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:33,799
Rheumatism begins and ascends.

48
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:47,329
The pains are going upwards, from down. This is the extension of the pain.

49
00:11:49,310 --> 00:12:00,379
You have a pain that starts in the ankle and then extents to the knee. That most probably is a Ledum case.

50
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:11,389
A Ledum case also is a case where the pains are shooting upwards. Ice cold applications.

51
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:23,040
Though the part can be cold, ice cold application makes it feel better.

52
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,559
Though the patient himself may not be a warm patient.

53
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:40,829
Also eczema is better with cold application, cold water, cold air.

54
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:56,729
Eczema which is worse by heat and better with cold.

55
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,290
Wounds become cold puffy.

56
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:14,009
Pains worse at night by warmth of bed covering and better by sticking feet in ice water.

57
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:36,999
You get a joint which is very painful where the pain from here shoots upwards; you put it in ice and it feels better. That is Ledum.

58
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:47,990
You get a pain here which needs cool, not very cold, just cool.

59
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:55,780
Then it's another remedy Guaj.

60
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:06,099
General aggravation from heat but some of the cases feel the cold very much.

61
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:12,679
So you don't always have to have a hot individual in Ledum.

62
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:31,509
Nodosities in the joints.
 Ledum is specific for uric acid arthritis, gout.

63
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:54,599
Where the big toe is swollen and red and
 painful and the pains shoot from the toe, up.

64
00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:02,039
They will tell you they need to put the feet on cold, ice-cold.

65
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:23,759
Once I had a case, the man was suffering 16 years and he had not to wear a shoe. The shoe was pressing

66
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:36,829
and it was very painful. So he had to cut, either the shoe was open or to wear something like a slipper, on top of the slipper.

67
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:53,429
 He used to have exposed the toe. So in1967 I came back from India and I was working with this architect before

68
00:15:53,430 --> 00:16:07,279
we were working together. I saw his foot and I said 'what is this?'. 'I suffer many years and now it has become much worse.

69
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:22,410
 What are you doing?'. 'I'm doing Homeopathy'. 'Can you do something for my foot?' I said 'yes I can do'.

70
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:43,180
I left his office by 1956 his office where I was working for him, building. He said, 'OK you give me a remedy'.

71
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:53,139
I said, 'no I will not give you a remedy'. By this time I was not charging anybody but a few rich people.

72
00:16:53,140 --> 00:17:01,020
He was very rich and he had become rich because of me actually, because I've been working like 3 people you know.

73
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:14,479
I said, now you are going to pay back everything that you owe me. I said, 'we'll make a deal. If I cure you

74
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:23,319
you will give me so much, a huge amount'. He said, 'OK'. He didn't believe it of course.

75
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:34,399
So I started treating him. From time to time I would go to the office and say, 'how are you?' For a long period of time

76
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:43,959
I did not go. Then I go one day and I see he is wearing shoes.

77
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:55,290
First I look at the shoes. I said, 'well you are wearing shoes?'

78
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,209
He says, 'I will tell you something. Unbelievable actually'.

79
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:32,679
 I said, 'what?', 'I was in Switzerland and somebody suggested Vichy water  a mineral water,

80
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:48,829
 and after drinking this water by miracle this thing was cured'. I couldn't believe it!

81
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:56,719
 I said, 'I see. Next time that you have a relapse, drink Vichy water, bye, bye'. He said, 'wait a moment'.

82
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:24,049
He pressed the button and comes the accountant and said 'pay him the money'.

83
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:33,080
It was Ledum one of the remedies which I had given him.

84
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:55,319
By this time I was Robin Hood. We were treating all people free but some rich people had to pay for everybody else.

85
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:03,609
And he was one of them. He was really rich but he tried immediately to play a trick.

86
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:10,729
 He didn't want to pay. Same thing others tried to do like this.

87
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:19,969
I said OK you don't need me. You take whatever because everyone finds things, a reason why he is now better.

88
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:32,119
I mean OK, when you have a relapse drink some coffee also, it will do you good. Coffee is very good for you.

89
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:11,199
I felt I had this task. I had to bring Homeopathy to this world, to establish it. The tricks they played, the fight

90
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:19,229
and what I had to fight, unbelievable. I said, yes still I will do it.

91
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:32,519
You just have to remember a few things like that and the miracle is coming, I tell you.

92
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:45,599
-Do you use Ledum in injuries in sports where people are putting ice?

93
00:21:45,600 --> 00:22:01,699
-If the ice is really very effective, then most probably you need Ledum. Also you need Ledum in punctured wounds

94
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:14,739
like cut, there is laceration and then pains are shooting pains.

95
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:34,919
You know here there are a lot of goats, especially 20 years ago. I hurt my foot where a rusty nail went inside.

96
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:43,309
The nail went inside quite a lot.

97
00:22:53,010 --> 00:23:07,720
 Everybody was saying, take antitetanus vaccine. I said, forget it and everybody was waiting 24 hours, 48 hours.

98
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:20,059
Secretly I took one dose, I thought maybe.

99
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:30,299
 And I remember I had some stinging pains coming and shooting from here where I was hurt.

100
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:42,210
Nothing happened of course. I don't know if Ledum affected the whole thing but I was not sick.
