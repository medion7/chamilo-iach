1
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,079
Pall. is an interesting remedy

2
00:00:47,550 --> 00:01:05,469
and the symptomatology of Pall. will be created in a person who has an emotional insecurity and at the same time

3
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:09,799
 has strong feelings.

4
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:37,409
And there is a third factor which takes part in this complex, and it is an unexpressed egotism.

5
00:01:49,480 --> 00:02:06,099
Why I say unexpressed egotism? These people they feel they are something special but they will never say it to anybody.

6
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:15,530
So this feeling 'I'm something'

7
00:02:15,531 --> 00:02:28,009
you can imagine a lot of emotions inside, I'm special, I have a lot of emotions but at the same time

8
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:41,479
 I have an emotional insecurity.  'Am I accepted by others, shall I be accepted?'

9
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:59,359
You can imagine the conflict which arises
 inside, in such a person.

10
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:20,319
And in order to balance these elements inside the person, they need outside approval, outside flattering.

11
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:34,849
In the Repertory it says desires flattering or something like this. Desires to be flattered but it is not a simple flatter.

12
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:38,887
 It is a flatter which has to be all the time.

13
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:48,029
Because all the time there is unbalance because of the insecurity, strong feelings, the egotism, the feeling

14
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:56,779
I'm something but I don't have to say it myself. Others have to tell me, I'm something special.

15
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:13,929
So there is a hunger for this approval from the social environment.

16
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:36,929
You get a boy or a girl who needs Pall. and they go to a party and in the party the others don't pay attention to them.

17
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:48,039
They will stay without speaking, without saying a word, expecting others to approach them and the idea is to say

18
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:54,039
you are so clever, you are so good looking, you are so this, you are so that.

19
00:04:54,040 --> 00:05:07,289
This does not happen and they go away and they are into pieces. They go home and they are absolutely in pieces.

20
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:11,789
They are depressed, they don't want to live anymore.

21
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:28,279
But if in the party somebody has paid attention, has given them approval, they are very happy.

22
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:50,569
It is so much the idea that 'I'm special and I have to be taken special care', so if this is not happening

23
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:56,959
 then they almost reach delusions that they have been neglected.

24
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,959
Everybody has neglected me. Nobody pays attention to me.

25
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:11,949
 And then they suffer and suffer and from one extreme they can go to the other.

26
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:19,199
You flatter them, they are on top of the world, you don't pay attention, you don't flatter them, they feel

27
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:29,739
 everybody rejects them, nobody wants to look at you or nobody pays attention.

28
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:48,399
They have a pride which is so easily shattered, so easily destroyed because others do not pay attention.

29
00:06:52,670 --> 00:07:04,849
But see the idea of pathology how develops and because if the individual does not get this flattery to balance

30
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:12,840
 you see it says: better with flattery.
It balances this inner conflict.

31
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:27,869
But if they don't get this flattery, then delusions of being large are developing.

32
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:38,799
I'm larger than the others, I'm taller than the others. Internal delusions.

33
00:07:50,440 --> 00:08:07,409
But they will not have an open confrontation with others. On the contrary they will avoid any kind of real, external confrontation.

34
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:11,839
You see everything happens inside.

35
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:36,289
And therefore they will be people that will show a real lack of self-confidence. They are never sure about themselves

36
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:45,529
unless somebody assures them. Somebody
tells them how good they are.

37
00:08:52,520 --> 00:09:05,389
You get Pall. children. They will go to school and in the school it happens that the teacher helps the child

38
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:10,119
by praising and they go to the top of the class.

39
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:21,129
They change school and the teacher pays no attention and they drop to the last. They don't care to work.

40
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:29,879
'They don't appreciate me, they don't understand me so why should I make an effort?'

41
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:38,389
You see the instability of this remedy.

42
00:09:45,560 --> 00:10:01,089
Also you get a child who has average intelligence and he has a delusion almost that he is very intelligent.

43
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:08,497
 'I know' but he will not say it to anybody. This is an inner thing.

44
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:21,952
But inside all the time expecting that from outside somebody will come and say 'yes, you know, yes you are good'.

45
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:47,080
Now this idea of 'I am more than I really am',

46
00:10:47,081 --> 00:11:06,319
this idea is very interesting how it will show in tumors or cysts  which become very large.

47
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:21,689
Especially in the women, we have huge tumors. If suddenly there is a tumor which is too big you have to think of Pall.

48
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:30,109
 especially if the tumor concerns the ovaries.

49
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:46,519
Cysts in the ovaries which take huge size, it is as if the organism cannot find outlet and blows up the organ.

50
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:25,169
The sexual desire for Pall. is quite strong but unexpressed. That means the individual feels the need to have

51
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:39,399
 sexual activity but due to the fact that these people are closed to the communication of others they do not get

52
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:56,959
easy outlet for this function. You understand, emotionally insecure people do not attract others, even if they have

53
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:11,230
strong feelings but if they are revolving around themselves and their image, they do not attract others.

54
00:13:11,231 --> 00:13:22,669
 Therefore in spite of having strong sexual urge, they have to resort to masturbation to release it.

55
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:28,399
Because it's difficult to communicate.

56
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:46,859
We say that this enlargement of the ego or the need for enlargement, it may show in huge tumors

57
00:13:46,860 --> 00:14:02,260
but there is a conflict which is going on, a strong conflict. See how it shows on the nervous system

58
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:19,499
 by producing convulsions ticks and especially produces a syndrome which is called Tourette syndrome.

59
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:35,239
There is a syndrome in which the child goes into ticks like this and at the same time it makes noises

60
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:46,569
and it's interesting that the noises he makes or the words he says, they have a sexual connotation.

61
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:12,469
I'm sorry but these are facts of life which you have to consider when you have in front of you the patient.

62
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:23,819
So therefore what we observe in these people is that in order to be excited sexually, they like to hear

63
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:37,879
or to say obscene words. They are excited by obscene words and they like to hear it also.

64
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:19,439
You understand that these people, if they have arrived to the point where the ticks are, it is more difficult

65
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,489
 to get a sexual partner.

66
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:35,160
So when they get one, they become
over sexual and similar to Platina.

67
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:43,629
With deviations and things like that.

68
00:16:46,680 --> 00:17:03,679
But what is interesting with these boys/girls is that...you see the opinion of others for them is very important

69
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:12,380
he told me I'm clever, he told me I'm stupid.

70
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:29,049
So we see in that syndrome which we call Tourette's syndrome, the children go to school for 5 hours

71
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:33,889
and nobody knows they have the ticks.

72
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:44,999
In the school they are totally composed, no ticks at all because the opinion of others matters so much

73
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:55,069
that the mind controls the electrical activity of the nervous system.

74
00:17:55,070 --> 00:18:04,569
It totally controls and makes them composed and nobody from the class knows that they have this problem.

75
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:19,969
It is as if all this super energy which is produced in the nervous system, is somewhere being conserved

76
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:28,969
within the organism and when they go home,
this thing is released and the parents go crazy.

77
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:45,969
And they go to school, nothing!
It is impressive the difference.

78
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:58,559
Most of the Tourette syndrome they will control in a social environment but Pall. controls totally.

79
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:03,559
It does not want to show anything.

80
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:17,719
Pall. is one of the main remedies that you will use in such a situation. Of course you don't use it only for that situation.

81
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:31,399
You understand the inner structure of the person, the need for flattery, the need to be approved, which also is the need

82
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:37,409
of Anac., the need of Bar-c.

83
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:50,519
They have similar needs but Bar-c. never thinks, I'm super. On the contrary they think, I'm stupid. Anac. also.

84
00:19:50,520 --> 00:20:03,709
These people think, I'm super, I'm very clever,
I'm very intelligent, nobody recognizes this.

85
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:19,249
And they can be very clever but even these very clever people, need support and they need flattery

86
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:24,850
in order to balance. Otherwise they cannot balance.

87
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:48,239
So the Pall. people are in a constant fight, constant conflict within themselves.

88
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:05,839
You hear the story and also they will not say much to the doctor.

89
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:17,383
 The real constitutional Pall. will not say much, is very reserved.

90
00:21:17,483 --> 00:21:24,539
They expect others to come to them, they will not go to others.

91
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:28,379
So they will not talk very much.

92
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:45,899
This is a remedy that you will need many times
 in starting Tourette's syndrome.

93
00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:10,329
You see Anac., Sil., Bar-c. will tell you, 'I feel totally incapable of doing things'. These people will not say I am incapable.

94
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:13,780
They say, 'the others think that I am incapable'.

95
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:27,969
 It is different but this 'the others not recognizing me', is tremendous. 'It kills me'. They go crying.

96
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:45,479
So you realize as a secondary action, the emotional insecurity. You say, why he needs so much support from outside?

97
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:57,239
You put things together and eventually you come down to the idea of Pall.

98
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:36,060
Peculiar symptom is 'as if something hanging from the throat'

99
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:50,779
And a feeling as if the uterus will prolapse.

100
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:59,199
The huge tumors is characteristic and especially in the woman.

101
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:08,279
Headache across the top of the head, from ear to ear also is a keynote.

102
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,489
Across like this.

103
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:33,280
Better with pressure or rubbing.

104
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:43,239
The patient will never tell you so exactly, he will just indicate that the pain is from here to here.

105
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:50,089
Whether it is like this or like this, is not important.

106
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:07,949
-I would like to share a case of Pall. There was this woman who was 23 years old and was training

107
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:14,279
to be a lawyer and the pathology for which
 she came, were severe headaches.

108
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:21,959
They were very peculiar, the pain would come in the occiput, as somebody gives a very hard blow to the head

109
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,949
and she falls unconscious with the impact of the pain.

110
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:33,439
All her tests had been done and the doctors were thinking perhaps she has epilepsy because twice she has fallen

111
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:42,759
in front of automobiles, because of the pain. But epilepsy was ruled out in the EEG and she was on strong

112
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:51,199
 painkillers for this and there was disturbance in her menstruation also. An ultrasound revealed that she had

113
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:58,400
polycystic ovarian disease which is a syndrome where you menstruate every 3-4 months

114
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:02,669
because the hormones are not in order.

115
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:12,569
This was all there, no modalities, nothing else and on questioning about her personality, she has this

116
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:19,839
typical pathology in the mind. She thought that she was never judged fairly in her exams, that she needed

117
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,769
to be to the top of the college but the Professor did not understand what she was saying.

118
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:33,599
And the exams were not fair because she was the best in the College but it was not with haughtiness

119
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,840
she did not say she expected me to understand that she is good and that the rest of the world does not understand.

120
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:51,799
After giving Pall. 200 and 1000 and then another 1000 in the period of 1,5 year, her menstruation became totally normal.

121
00:26:51,800 --> 00:27:00,839
But she had long cycles which is expected in PCO people, 14-15 days and the headaches were gone absolutely

122
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:05,370
and I follow her up for 2,5 years and she is fine.

123
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:16,989
-You see there the headache is on the occiput as if a blow, it's a new kind of headache. It's not important

124
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:24,649
with the headache you can find the remedy. You can find the remedy by understanding the patient.

125
00:27:53,360 --> 00:28:11,969
Ruta is a well-known remedy for treating traumas in tendons, in periosteum, in connective tissues.

126
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:44,569
Also it's a very good, specific remedy for bursa the kind of cyst that develops near these tendons or joints

127
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:54,119
 where there is some special action of the tissues. Sometimes they develop a kind of bulge which is a kind of

128
00:28:54,120 --> 00:29:07,519
 cyst called bursa. I don't know if there is more modern expression for this. This is the old expression.

129
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:33,590
If anybody has a ganglion take a Ruta 200
 and tell me tomorrow if it's gone.

130
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:55,709
It's a remedy which is restless, which is having similar symptoms with Rhus-t. and worse with cold and wet.

131
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:06,039
A remedy that usually does not want to communicate.

132
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:16,059
Because they develop easy vertigos
you may think that they need Bry.

133
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:38,680
There is a state of mind which is foggy and sluggish and slow and there is a better word, bewildered.

134
00:30:47,600 --> 00:31:01,009
It's very interesting that Ruta is one of the important remedies in panic attacks.

135
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:15,159
With this mind which is bewildered, with this slowness of the mind, especially when they find themselves

136
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:23,729
in a hot environment, the panic attack comes.

137
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:38,729
Panic that they are going to die and they have to rush to emergency room.

138
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:58,119
It is an anxiety that they cannot define. It is an anxiety, a panic state which they have not been able to define.

139
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:11,819
I have asked them afterwards, can you tell us what you were feeling before? I was not able to get a good description

140
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:25,279
of their state. It is a panic attack which paralyses them, which leaves them helpless and fear that death is imminent

141
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,889
 that death is coming.

142
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:35,160
And they have to get some help.

143
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:56,899
There is fear of evil and fear of water like Stram. or Lyss.

144
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:20,409
In this mind which is slow and not functioning very clearly, still they have a kind of dissatisfaction

145
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:25,549
with themselves, dissatisfaction with others.

146
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:32,630
They can become defiant.

147
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:49,400
'I don't accept what you say'. It is not contradiction.

148
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:04,759
It is within the idea of dissatisfaction which this remedy has.

149
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:17,070
If you talk to them you will see they feel like not committing suicide but saying that this life is a burden for me

150
00:34:17,071 --> 00:34:21,040
it is too much to live.

151
00:34:24,363 --> 00:34:41,799
This dissatisfaction is not an alive dissatisfaction, it is rather resignation 'I cannot live life, I cannot walk

152
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,399
 I cannot go along, I cannot move'.

153
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:56,959
In children who are studying and because of the study they develop headaches, the main remedy is Calc-p.

154
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:09,480
 Also Ruta has to be considered in such cases. Especially if the child complains of the mind not being clear.

155
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:24,629
They try to read and by the movement of the eyes a kind of headache or vertigo is coming up and the child

156
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:27,639
 has to give up studying.

157
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:44,209
Sometimes the headache is like a nail which drives in. You will use this also in lumbagos where you have...

158
00:35:46,440 --> 00:36:02,199
a symptom like Bry., where with the deep respiration you feel the pain. And it's better lying down.

159
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:22,039
I would say this remedy is between Bry. and Rhus-t. without having the thirst of Bry. and having

160
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:35,819
the restlessness of Rhus-t. and the mental picture of Bry.

161
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:50,450
Yet they don't want company but if they go into the panic states, they have to be accompanied always

162
00:36:50,451 --> 00:36:55,679
by somebody to feel secure.

163
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:14,519
So if somebody comes with vertigo or panic attacks for instance, the mind is sluggish, slow and if he tells you

164
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:29,339
 especially that most panic attacks come in the heat, 'if I get too warm I go into a panic attack', that is Ruta.

165
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:42,929
That's all you have to remember about Ruta. If I tell you more and more, you will remember nothing, at the end forget it.

166
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:53,839
And of course for traumatic cases, this remedy is a traumatic remedy when the joints are traumatized

167
00:37:53,840 --> 00:38:05,909
and especially the periosteum. When there is a blow and there is a pain and the pain is really because

168
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:17,839
 of the trauma of the periosteum, Ruta becomes a specific like when we have this bursa/ganglion, whatever you call it.

169
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:27,199
-Is this indicated for carpal tendon syndrome?
-Yes.

170
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:39,419
-Did you tell it's a remedy for ganglion on the tendons?
-Yes.

171
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:55,679
-I had a case with a ganglion on the wrist and it went away, it got very soft for two days and then it was absorbed

172
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,199
by the body but it grew again.

173
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,929
-After Ruta?
-After Ruta, it grew again.

174
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:11,319
-And you repeated Ruta?
-Yes, it went away again but it grows again, it's the third time it grows now.

175
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:26,359
-You gave Ruta it went away. Then it came back. You gave Ruta again, what happened?

176
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:30,879
-It went away again.
-And then it grew back?

177
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,359
-It's coming up now, it's growing very slowly.

178
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:39,969
-Maybe it needs a third dose.

179
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:53,279
You see this kind of treatment is a superficial treatment but many times it is impressive.

180
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:04,949
Because sometimes it grows so much especially in places where there is some friction because of the work they are doing,

181
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:15,739
 they develop this bursa and they have to be operated. Then you give a remedy, they go to the surgeon, he says where is it?

182
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:28,249
But it's not the way. When you have the picture, that picture of the mind, when you have this difficulty

183
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:41,239
 the tendons get stiff and break, that is why the muscles that move the eyes, have a stiffness.

184
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:58,349
So there is an effort, then it becomes headache which looks like between vertigo and headache and sometimes

185
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:05,939
 the headache will end up becoming like a nail which is going inside.

186
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:15,199
-For differential diagnosis with Rhus-t., is it true that Ruta does not ameliorate from motion?

187
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:31,479
-No, it is not especially ameliorated. Ruta has restlessness, also it has another symptom you may find

188
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:41,559
if you touch them by the time that they sleep,
for instance, there is a big reaction.

189
00:41:47,960 --> 00:42:01,199
What we try to do here is to give you the basic, so you stick to that and not to keynotes that maybe will be misleading.

190
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:12,309
-George since we're learning Classic Homeopathy, I want your opinion, each time there is a local

191
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:20,935
treatment on one's particular symptom, we're talking very often about Arn. etc. you consider that as a suppression

192
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:32,129
 to avoid and in case of acute you have to give the remedy straight away, you can work on the constitutional

193
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:35,119
so what is the solution for that?

194
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:54,379
-Yes many times I would say we give remedies and we ameliorate symptoms, not the patient. This is not good.

195
00:42:54,380 --> 00:43:10,399
You, see I like to see an aggravation. If somebody comes and tells me, 'I got your remedy and I feel very good'

196
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:18,100
 I do not like it. Most of the cases they report aggravations.

197
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:25,034
Therefore that means in an aggravation that you have touched deeper.

198
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:32,159
If you see immediate amelioration either you have touched superficially like you say, a symptom

199
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:41,460
or the case is incurable, like this case that was presented. Every remedy brought an amelioration.

200
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:54,600
 Now you will say what do you expect from Diphtherinum? Is it going to be an aggravation? I say yes most probably.

201
00:43:55,220 --> 00:44:04,079
 If that touches deeper the case and starts a curative reaction, it will be an aggravation.

202
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:10,879
And what will be the aggravation? I cannot say in this case. The organism will decide, whatever.

203
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:20,219
But if you see a case incurable, you give a remedy better, you give Sulph., it worked beautifully

204
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:28,989
Caust., Nat-m., all the remedies gave an amelioration.

205
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:38,759
Finally we say this case is incurable, that's how we know the case is incurable.

206
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:54,959
-I see quite often people come and patients come with overuse of the body, like digging too much in the garden

207
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:05,639
having problems in the shoulder and tennis elbow. What I mostly do I start with Rhus-t. and see how it's going on

208
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:14,599
 and I don't have a good feeling for Ruta, so my question is what kind of acute condition, you would give Ruta?

209
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:22,010
-In local symptoms.

210
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:34,800
I would say Ruta if you have an aggravation from heat where in Rhus-t. you have an amelioration from heat

211
00:45:34,801 --> 00:45:37,520
you can make the differential diagnosis.

212
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:53,835
Of course in aggravation from heat, you will have to differentiate between Guaj. also and Led.

213
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:08,829
You see these people who play tennis, they are quite strong people, usually they are healthy, they will not give you

214
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:21,079
 general symptoms. But even then, you may try to see if you can get something more general.

215
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:36,199
-I want to ask again about the aggravation story. I have quite a lot of fight with some homeopaths who said that if you give

216
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:46,199
 the Similimum, there is no aggravation because of the same energy. I would like the truth because

217
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:52,629
 some people say, my patients don't have any aggravation and they are really good.

218
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:06,299
-This, no aggravation and then really having a cure is a possibility for very few individuals.

219
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:28,959
In 1978, we wrote a paper. We made statistics in our cases, how many had initial aggravation and it was 80%

220
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:36,300
 and we wrote a paper for the International Congress.

221
00:47:36,301 --> 00:47:45,469
By that time the idea of aggravation was not even coming into possibility at all.

222
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:54,159
And of course the idea of a cure was also far away, at the same time.

223
00:47:54,160 --> 00:48:02,119
Most of the doctors at that time they were describing mixtures of remedies and they were trying

224
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:09,599
 to reduce the symptoms. But this is not the idea here.

225
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:18,479
-I'm getting a bit confused concerning the temperature modalities, in your paper it says aggravation

226
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,319
from exertion, from cold and dampness.

227
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:26,359
At the same time when you gave the example of the panic attack, you said especially it occurs when somebody

228
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:31,679
 comes into a warm environment. I can't put the two together.

229
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:47,399
- This is what we see many times. Actually the panic attacks, this tremendous fear of death is

230
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:53,399
when the organism gets heated.

231
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:13,279
In the arthritic pains, we have restlessness
 and worse cold also and worse damp.

232
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:33,959
You can have both like you have both in Nat-c., you have both in Merc., you have both aggravations.

233
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:42,209
-If a patient shows an aggravation in a severe disease, like multiple sclerosis, it might be as well a spell

234
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:49,489
of the disease itself, not an aggravation brought about by the remedy but the spell of the disease.

235
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:53,299
How do you differentiate and how do you deal with this?

236
00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:04,689
-The aggravation is such a case is gradual. The aggravation which I'm talking about will be something

237
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:07,189
 which will come from one day to the other.

238
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:19,519
And most probably will not concern the pathology itself, like in this case. That means she may not develop

239
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,239
 a further inability to swallow.

240
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:38,399
She may develop a headache, she may develop more perspiration but not necessarily the pathology itself.

241
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:50,319
The organism will decide but even if the pathology is aggravated for the time being, still it is a sign of course...

242
00:50:52,990 --> 00:51:01,759
 that there might be a possibility. Because the aggravation may just continue without being able to reverse it.

243
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:12,169
In incurable cases we may have aggravations that if we wait, it will go on and on and on.

244
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:23,899
In incurable cases we have aggravations which end up into speeding up.

245
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:37,339
-When I take a case of Ruta which is not basically chronic, is this possible that I'm just having local symptom

246
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:42,169
 that is due to over exertion, like ganglion?

247
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:49,839
Then I don't get any symptoms of the mind. From what I understand they only develop when I get deeper and deeper

248
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:59,279
 into the pathology of remedy. And how then will
 I recognize Ruta, just because of the ganglion?

249
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:11,009
-This is what I said, if you don't have deeper symptoms, you prescribe on superficial symptoms

250
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:23,770
and such superficial symptoms can go away but at the same time do not touch the general condition of the patient.
