1
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:28,310
I'd like to speak today on Cann-i.

2
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:48,252
and the era of Cann-i. that the western civilization went through and I believe we're still going through.

3
00:00:52,370 --> 00:01:09,332
I'd like to speak a little bit in depth on this very important drug, especially of the young people.

4
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:35,748
And to see and find out what Cann-i. can do for the human race and what we can do to erase the effects of Cann-i. on the race.

5
00:01:42,740 --> 00:02:07,922
It was a big question for me why the younger people of the previous and the present generation, they were so much in favor of using Cann-i.

6
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:13,792
What was the reason behind?

7
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:33,840
I have understood that the exciting causes for diseases were of 3 different types.

8
00:02:35,540 --> 00:03:00,822
The first was a frustration on the survival instinct. When a man does not have the means to survive physically, he wants to support his physical body.

9
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:16,660
And he has to have a job, he has to have food and the lack of these basic things bring about a frustration on the physical body and we have a frustration on the survival instinct.

10
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:29,622
That can be the exciting cause for diseases which can be either chronic or acute.

11
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:55,570
Another reason for frustration is on another level and that is on emotional level. Frustration on an emotional level which also covers the sexual sphere.

12
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:11,812
I have noticed that it is very frequently another exciting cause for bringing up, manifesting acute or chronic diseases.

13
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:31,272
And here we have what orthodox Medicine also recognizes as psychosomatic diseases and the type of psychosomatic diseases.

14
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:45,482
And the third reason for chronic diseases is the frustration on a spiritual level.

15
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:55,032
And I consider this area very important for our contemporary society.

16
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:08,242
What happened was that the generation that started going in Cann-i. had actually solved the problem of survival.

17
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:15,302
They felt quite secure that they could survive even if they did very little work or not at all.

18
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:31,140
The society was ready to support, the parents, the society, the different security forms that existed in the society. So that instinct was satisfied.

19
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:53,452
Also the so-called freedom on the emotional and sexual level presented an abundance in this area.

20
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:10,902
And therefore left the young people over-satisfied with food and sex finally.

21
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:29,052
And the next step that had to be satisfied was a spiritual need, a need to know the truth.

22
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:45,652
I believe that this was the reason why so many young people went into drugs in general.

23
00:06:46,940 --> 00:07:05,962
As they felt that material needs were so easily satisfied, they felt also that they had the right or the possibility to taste a spiritual kind of

24
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:16,117
understanding or to come into contact with what they felt it is the truth.

25
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:30,302
States of enlightenment that have been described in different spiritual books by different spiritual teachers became then the object of the young people.

26
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:41,522
But they were unprepared to really rise up to the situation.

27
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:56,612
And Cann-i. provided a very easy way of coming into contact with something that they felt was inside all the time.

28
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:05,930
A state of being that was inside but it was unattainable through sheer efforts.

29
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:21,502
I feel this is mostly the reason why the young generation went into this kind of exploration.

30
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:55,972
I said before that this generation was unprepared to face spiritual truth.

31
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:22,022
I believe that the seeking out on a spiritual level is a natural kind of drive within the human beings

32
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:36,542
once they have satisfied the lower levels of survival, instinct and also sexual instinct which are very powerful.

33
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:54,792
But there has to be an effort, you see in spiritual things you're dealing with truth. Therefore you cannot bluff anybody.

34
00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:09,202
In material things we can bluff each other, we can rationalize, we can say I deserve also to have money in spite of not working because

35
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:25,062
 I did not ask to be born my parents brought me here because they wanted to have pleasure and so I was born and therefore it is their responsibility to feed me.

36
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:32,312
That's an immature attitude that we can take and we can have, we can feed ourselves.

37
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:43,172
We can feed it with material food bluffing our way.

38
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:55,932
Then the material body feeds on material food and oxygen.

39
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:09,352
There is another body within us, the emotional body, the emotional structure which feeds on what?

40
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:23,072
Can anybody tell me? What is the food? Emotions are not the food.

41
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:42,712
Impressions, we receive impressions and impressions generate feelings. The food on the emotional level is impressions.

42
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:55,582
We can have that because impressions are not difficult to get.

43
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:06,152
And we can stimulate our emotions with different kinds of impressions.

44
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:18,262
The problem was that this generation that went into drugs, into Cann-i., again misused impressions.

45
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:36,822
They found again very easy excitement of the emotions and they wanted more and more and more excitement. Nothing was then satisfying them.

46
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:50,092
There was a kind of immaturity also on that level; I want adventure.

47
00:12:51,440 --> 00:13:01,182
They wanted relationships for the pleasure only.

48
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:18,760
And this seeking of impressions lead to a dead end.

49
00:13:18,828 --> 00:13:32,072
Because young people of 20, 23,25 felt already very old, that they knew already everything.

50
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:48,112
There is a balance in the body. Let's take an extreme example.

51
00:13:48,180 --> 00:14:07,068
You lie down and you open your mouth and somebody is feeding you all the time. Lying down, feeding you with chocolates, sweets, fatty food and you lie down and you just eat.

52
00:14:07,168 --> 00:14:11,392
This is the situation. What is going to happen to the physical body?

53
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:19,662
It's going to get sick. The same thing happens with the emotions.

54
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:42,390
Without any kind of effort, without any respect to that portion of the human body the young generations asked more and more pleasures and pleasurable impressions.

55
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:57,192
As a result the body got unbalanced, the emotional level got unbalanced.

56
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:22,252
There was a kind of saturation. And then came the need for spiritual truth and understanding.

57
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:34,402
And then the spiritual feeds with what?

58
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:47,412
What is the food of the spiritual part?

59
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:11,132
Do you think that a man can stay alive spiritually if he pursues simple knowledge?

60
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:25,680
Learning only some, will he stay alive? Pursuing some knowledge, crapping his memory with knowledge?

61
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:50,010
What the spiritual part needs to be alive?
What is a good food that will keep it alive?

62
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:59,622
The spiritual feeds on ideas.

63
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:16,882
The physical feeds from a lower part of evolution. What is physical in us feeds from the animal, the vegetable, the mineral kingdom.

64
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:23,962
The physical part of us feeds on what is lower than us.

65
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:40,622
The spiritual part in us feeds on what is higher than us. Do you see the difference?

66
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:53,512
You need a book of new ideas to understand and to feel that you are alive spiritually.

67
00:17:53,580 --> 00:18:05,822
Somebody who is higher than you will give some ideas and these ideas will make you feel more free, more in contact with the truth.

68
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:22,462
So therefore the spiritual part in us cannot be bluffed because we are on a certain level.

69
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:42,882
We cannot play with ourselves and bluff ourselves. We need real ideas, ideas coming  from the truth in order to feel the kind of nourishment that we need spiritually.

70
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:57,172
That is what the people were seeking through Cann-i.

71
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:22,062
They were trying to bluff because to be fed from a higher source spiritually, you have to make an effort, to lift yourself to that source.

72
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:35,382
There has to be a kind of homogeneity that will communicate. Nobody can give spiritual truth, understanding, enlightment etc.

73
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:43,080
if you just lie down in the sun and you are half dozed, unconscious.

74
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:58,632
The super conscious in men has to be awaken. Now Cann-i. what it did, gave a delusion of truth.

75
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:15,062
It gave an appearance as if the person was having the state of truth.

76
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:21,652
What was the payment for that?

77
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:39,883
The payment was a miasm that was engrafted upon many many people and we call the Cann-i. miasm or proving.

78
00:20:50,880 --> 00:21:05,840
It is interesting also that to see who are the people who are taking Cann-i. It used to be in the past a few people that used to take Cann-i.

79
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:11,502
They were basic people seeking pleasure.

80
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:29,052
Not spiritual questioning or seeking, just sheer pleasure, they were the people who went for narcotics in the past.

81
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:36,192
They were seeking pleasure on a completely material level.

82
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:50,472
Today the use of Cann-i. is mostly from people seeking spiritual understanding.

83
00:21:54,580 --> 00:22:02,732
Out of those people who take this drug, I have seen 3 kinds of reactions.

84
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:24,642
The first are people who had mixed experiences with Cann-i., some pleasurable experiences and some very unpleasurable.

85
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:50,412
After going for a while in the drug culture, they gave up. And these are the lucky people and they came out with a conviction that Cann-i. is not the solution.

86
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:09,752
There is another type of those people with weak will mostly that were caught on this pleasure.

87
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,412
They followed this path and they  became addicts.

88
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:34,782
The first group does not need treatment. The second group does it need treatment and what can we do about them?

89
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:49,392
The second group is the group that likes the pleasure, they are convinced that it is good for them, they are convinced drug addicts.

90
00:23:52,880 --> 00:24:05,542
And we are going to try to take them away from the drugs. What Cann-i. can do in a potentized form? What other drugs can do?

91
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:10,642
What do you think?

92
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:26,032
Can we save these people? Do they want to be saved?

93
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:40,542
If you give them a Cann-i. on high potency, even without knowing, is it going to have an effect? What kind of effect?

94
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:52,822
Do you have experience in treating such people?

95
00:24:54,980 --> 00:25:02,002
There is really very little hope for the people who are really caught in the drugs.

96
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:11,422
Out of these drug addicts we may be able to help a 20%.

97
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,550
The confirmed drug addicts that say, 'I like it'.

98
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:36,082
I don't talk about people who say, 'I don't like it, I try, I cannot get out of it but I want to try'. This is another group of people.

99
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:51,012
This is the third group of people that understand the effect upon them which can be two-fold.

100
00:25:51,080 --> 00:26:11,832
Either an effect because of the long use of the drug or an effect because they have a great sensitivity towards that drug.

101
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:20,012
And these people usually have experiences which are not at all pleasurable.

102
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:48,972
They have very frightening experiences usually. These people can have an engraftment on their system of the Cann-i. state by just using once or twice Cann-i.

103
00:26:49,040 --> 00:27:07,022
Once they go a little bit bigger in their dose, the mind is engrafted and from that point onwards there is going to be a symptomatology that we shall be talking about.

104
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:25,862
So from this third group is that we really get our information about the proving of the drug.

105
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:41,632
When you have the pleasurable state, you do not have the proving of the drug.

106
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:51,612
People will not come to you to be treated because of the Cann-i. state which is pleasurable.

107
00:27:53,940 --> 00:28:00,532
We shall see what is the real pathological state of Cann-i.

108
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:39,559
Before going into pathology of the Cann-i. state, I would like to give you an idea of what I think is happening when somebody takes the drug in general.

109
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:48,682
And according to this idea the pathology will be around this idea.

110
00:28:49,960 --> 00:29:01,312
Let us say symbolically that there are 3 kinds of levels. The physical level, the physical world

111
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:16,032
another world which is the dream world or they call it the astral world and above that is the spiritual world.

112
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:35,470
A human being living in this physical world cannot come in touch with the pure spiritual world because this world is guarded somewhat by the astral.

113
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:50,742
The astral level is what we live in our dreams. Sometimes we live a bad experience, sometimes we live a very nice experience in our dream.

114
00:29:53,260 --> 00:30:04,202
Now in order to live in this dream state, there is a kind of detachment between the physical body and the ethereal body which is within us.

115
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:20,432
A kind of detachment that we leave the physical body during sleep and we live in this level that we call astral or whatever you want to call it.

116
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:48,312
What Cann-i. does actually and most of the drugs is to bring about a forceful detachment of the astral body and make the person live into the world of dreams, into the world of delusions.

117
00:30:54,060 --> 00:31:12,572
But now this process is the same process as the one that is used by the yogis, the saints, the spiritual people when they have out of the body experiences

118
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:27,052
 and when they try to come out of their body and approach that spiritual world which is the world of light, enlightenment.

119
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:44,532
They try to do it after an effort of many years with very systematic work. Cann-i. will do the same thing for the individual, will detach the body forcefully.

120
00:31:44,600 --> 00:32:01,790
But in order this astral part in us will go on a higher kind of level approaching the spiritual, it has to be what?

121
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:11,962
-Pure.
-It has to be pure.

122
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:28,392
That's why the experiences which the young people have, because the young people are pure, many times have spiritual taste.

123
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:45,292
Because of their purity the body is just jerked out, the intensity is for spiritual experiences and they pass through this after world

124
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:56,552
and they come up on a higher level of this astral level where experiences are kind of spiritual.

125
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:25,312
But if there is a fear within the experimental, if there is a bad situation or bad vibrations in the environment, if there is guilt inside, fear, guilt, negative emotions, whatever

126
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:40,202
by coming out of the body, going to this realm, it will be caught on the lower levels of the astral world and there the experiences are terrifying.

127
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:53,500
That's why many people will take this drug and they will have a terrifying experience. They go through hell.

128
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:33,062
If somebody, his constitution is such that is easily detachable, the astral part from the physical part, then this person is prone, is predisposed to have Cann-i. symptomatology.

129
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:41,002
What will happen now as far as pathology?

130
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:47,782
There are 3 different stages that the pathology can follow.

131
00:34:53,180 --> 00:35:09,112
The first stage is a kind of excitement. An intensive excitement which makes the person become very loquacious.

132
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:27,482
He will talk, make fun, tease people, being in a state of excitement, you see the person and you say this is not a natural state.

133
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:35,720
Too much excitement, loquacity, ideas, talking of different things.

134
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:49,882
And during that stage he may relate to you a few delusions here and there that may be happening to him.

135
00:35:49,950 --> 00:36:20,152
And while there is that kind of excitement and mental stimulation especially, there are times when the mind seems scattered and becomes completely absent minded.

136
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:38,672
So great absent mindedness will alternate with states of stimulation of the intellect and loquacity and then as a result we have laughing, immoderate laughing.

137
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:49,172
You see this person who is excitable, how easily is to break out into laughing now.

138
00:36:52,500 --> 00:37:11,672
And with the least provocation, will make him laugh in a way that will show you that this person is not balanced.

139
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:35,182
In that state they may have a kind of clairvoyant ability, not that they can use this clairvoyance willingly. It just comes.

140
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:40,922
From time to time with open eyes, they may visualize things.

141
00:37:47,500 --> 00:38:03,412
And because of that excitement in this stage we see many times trembling and especially shaking of the head. The trembling is on the head or on the hands.

142
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:29,910
And some other times you will see suddenly to bring out an anger that you do not expect. It is sudden and it is very strong.

143
00:38:45,180 --> 00:39:09,112
During that state also you will see that these people they have a tendency to try and find out in an intellectual manner truth, what is happening, making all kinds of theories and ideas.

144
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:26,332
What is the net result of that, you will see an over stimulation that is on the brink of something breaking down. An over stimulation of the intellect.

145
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:44,192
You do not have to have theories like Einstein theory and this theory and that theory and the philosophical theories, no, no.

146
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:59,822
They may be theorizing about little things. Why this book is blue and white and why the man who produced that has made it and they can bring a whole story

147
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:15,722
about how this book was conceived, what the man thought, what is the symbolism of blue and white. Then they go to another subject, to another subject.

148
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:34,382
At this stage they will not almost consult you. It is the other people around them that feel that something is wrong with that guy.

149
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:54,072
They, themselves do not feel yet the need; all the symptomatology is in the first stage that does not yet provoke suffering on the path of the person.

150
00:40:55,350 --> 00:41:08,270
In the books of Cann-i. will say ecstatic state etc.
Even Kent will say that. I have not seen this state.

151
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:22,341
That means without taking the drug some person to have ecstatic state which bothers him and will come to you for consultation.

152
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:29,682
Cannabis produces these states but you will not see them in treating cases.

153
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:42,762
What you will see it will be that stimulation, that trembling, the stimulation, the thirst is increased, the urine is excreted quite a lot.

154
00:41:42,830 --> 00:42:03,150
There is a stimulation definately and there is also a hunger which is greater than usual which again predisposes the person, or gives you the idea of diabetes.

155
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:30,142
Then the second stage comes which is the painful state and which is exactly what we described, the disconnection between the astral body and the physical body on a permanent basis almost.

156
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:39,492
What these people feel now is that they have something that there is something in them which is out of their control.

157
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:50,132
As the excitement state breaks down, then what happens is the astral body or part of the astral body seems to go out.

158
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:58,142
They have a very real sense that the arm is raising up.

159
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:16,010
The arm is there but the feeling has gone away and that feeling is now that produces what we see in the books 'fear of insanity' in Cann-i.

160
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:22,750
Fear of insanity in Cann-i. you will seldom hear it like that.

161
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:33,462
The person to come and tell you, you know something I have fear of insanity, I'm afraid I'm going to lose my mind. Very seldom.

162
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:47,982
They will tell different stories, they will tell these experiences, the leg comes up, the head is as if opens and closes.

163
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:59,602
The hand goes up and then it goes down. It can happen to any part of the body, especially the head and the extremities.

164
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:15,782
They go out and back again and that feeling brings about a tremendous fear with panic that they may lose control.

165
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:33,622
The fear in Cann-i. is fear of losing control on any level, not only losing control of the hand.

166
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:41,312
Neither they will say 'I'm afraid of losing control of my mind'. They will say 'I have to have control'.

167
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:58,172
What do you mean by that? That means I'm travelling and have to have a kind of security that I know who is driving, whether he is a good driver etc.

168
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:08,743
I have to have control. He goes with another driver who do not trust, immediately fears and panics develop.

169
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:21,212
Another example is, you're going to give me a remedy, I have to know what it is.

170
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:27,222
Why? Because in this way I have a  control. I know that you're giving me Sulphur.

171
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:36,232
And I have a control. If you give me something which I don't know, I don't have a control, then I'm going to panic, panicky states.

172
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:56,152
Fear of losing control so much so that it goes into panic states, so much so that when they drive with a car they fear that they may lose control.

173
00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:01,308
And they may just pass out, faint. You know these things will happen.

174
00:46:01,408 --> 00:46:20,942
The hand makes them almost impossible to keep on doing the daily tasks, especially driving with a car. They may just give up driving.

175
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:53,502
In these stages these people will get hallucinations, delusions. What kind of delusions?

176
00:46:54,810 --> 00:47:07,880
If you look in the Materia Medica or in the Repertory, the Cann-i. is full of delusions, anything imaginable can be produced by Cann-i.

177
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:28,912
But what is interesting for you to remember in order to recognize Cann-i. in a case is that these delusions will have the idea of going out of the body and travelling out of the body.

178
00:47:30,980 --> 00:48:04,942
So delusion that they're riding on a horse, that will fly away and start wandering amongst the stars, that is flying or dancing around the sun.

179
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:28,902
This kind of ethereal delusions which are not pleasant. Do not imagine that they have these ideas or delusions and they feel pleasant.

180
00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:40,912
They feel they lost control completely and before they break down which is the third stage, they go into panicky states.

181
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:59,132
During that state the face looks burned out and exhausted.

182
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:23,262
The eyes usually will have a glistening, kind of bright glistening and later on will become dull.

183
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:45,452
Detachment of the body and the mind, this is the idea which gives the idea of paralysis which may happen with Cann-i.

184
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:55,052
With Cann-i. we may have stages of complete paralysis for a certain time, a certain period.

185
00:49:56,520 --> 00:50:08,132
The people feel paralyzed completely and then they may come back. It's a hysterical kind of paralysis.

186
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:24,412
Delusions which are inside the head like delusions of hearing but inside the head.

187
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:30,422
As if somebody singing within them, especially the moment which they try to fall asleep.

188
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:44,992
This is a difficult time for Cann-i. because this is the time where the body is separating actually and can cause a lot of problems.

189
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:51,412
And a lot of jerkings also, severe jerkings that will wake up the person.

190
00:50:57,450 --> 00:51:02,622
But what you're interested to remember is this intellectual stimulation in the beginning.

191
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:22,042
 Theories, loquacity, laughing and then these panicky states where all this happens on a level where the person feels

192
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:34,922
if I tell now that I fear insanity, then the other person may believe that I'm insane and then I lost control.

193
00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:45,702
They feel that there is a tiny bind that if it breaks, then they will go off and then they will become insane.

194
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:58,012
And that tiny break they try to keep and try not to tell that they really feel fear of insanity.

195
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:06,862
So in Cann-i. you will not get the patient telling fear of insanity.

196
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:18,870
Which is the remedy that will say it quite easily?

197
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:36,860
Calcarea, Pulsatilla also and Mancinella. For different reasons but they will express it.

198
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:52,070
Cann-i. is capital letters on the Repertory together with Calcarea, Mancinella, Pulsatilla but it will not say, 'I have fear of insanity'. I have never heard it from Cann-i. persons.

199
00:52:53,970 --> 00:53:11,062
I have seen that urge to have control of every situation possible you can imagine. Never mind what is the situation, they have to have a control. A logical control.

200
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:25,262
And if they feel they are losing that, they are going into panic and it will appear then as if they have tremendous what?

201
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:35,570
What is the Repertory symptom that you may be mislead to be looking at?

202
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:57,582
As I was describing this state and you have to imagine I'm trying to make you imagine having the patient, talking to you, saying different things.

203
00:53:57,650 --> 00:54:00,252
And how you will differentiate.

204
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:11,342
So he will tell you about all these panicky things and he will call you on the telephone because it's not easy to get Cann-i. from the beginning.

205
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:18,342
You will give other remedies before you reach the conclusion that this is a Cann-i. case.

206
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:35,432
So Cann-i. will appear to have great anxiety about health. It will appear to have tremendous anxiety because they will call you and tell you again and again their symptomatology.

207
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:55,052
'George I don't feel well, I don't know what's wrong with me'. What do you have? I have tried again and again whether they will tell fear of insanity. No.

208
00:54:55,120 --> 00:55:08,610
So they get the idea that they fear about their health. 'But what do you fear about your health?'. 'No, I don't fear about my health, I don't have an anxiety'. 'What do you feel?'.

209
00:55:09,310 --> 00:55:16,752
Fear of losing control. The most they can reach to tell you, fear of losing control.

210
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:31,322
It is not an anxiety but it will definitely appear to you as an anxiety for certain period of time before you come down to the idea.

211
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:45,302
These stages are usually accompanied by great prostration, great weakness of the body.

212
00:55:48,590 --> 00:56:01,962
The first stage is exaltation and a lot of activity of the mind, of the body also. A lot of drinking, thirst.

213
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:21,932
I remember a case of Cann-i. I don't think it's mentioned in the Repertory as great thirst but I remember one of my first cases where I've never seen such a thirst in a Cann-i. case.

214
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:41,813
Great thirst, great appetite, a lot of energy. Second stage, out of the body experiences, ethereal experiences.

215
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:50,812
The head opens as if it's lift, they feel the head is lift and then it closes.

216
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:58,322
You understand the panic that can accompany such experiences.

217
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:11,622
And then prostration leading up to paralysis, tremendous weakness leading up to paralysis.

218
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:24,642
And then hallucinations of that type, travelling around and flying away from their body.

219
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:40,792
Clairvoyant experiences the first stage and the second stage. Absent minded very much in the first stage with periods of distraction.

220
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:52,872
The mind feels no complete, not there, not total, not able to do, to perform a special duty.

221
00:57:54,840 --> 00:58:01,212
Trembling of hands and the head.

222
00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:14,622
How do they behave now sexually?

223
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:26,532
Before we go sexually I will describe to you the third stage.

224
00:58:42,620 --> 00:59:09,542
The third stage is a kind of complete breakdown where you can see the person really becoming old, his eyes from bright glistening that was before, become dull.

225
00:59:11,210 --> 00:59:23,392
A sense of paralysis and paralysis comes to the intellect. The intellect and the power of concentration is broken down completely.

226
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:39,882
They try to concentrate and it's impossible. They try to focus their eyes and it's impossible, it brings dizziness and a state of weariness and tiredness.

227
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:45,860
They lose urine, they just go away.

228
00:59:54,060 --> 01:00:08,670
The energy is so little that they have to lie down all the time and recuperate in order to get up and do very little things for very little time. They will have to lie back again.

229
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:22,582
In that state there is no fear anymore, there is no panic.

230
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:30,862
There is something beyond the fear and beyond the panic where people have lost complete control, they cannot control the urine

231
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:44,150
they cannot control the bowel movement, voluntary movements of any organ almost.

232
01:00:54,250 --> 01:01:11,142
So in this way we have a picture of what Cann-i. can do. It can first stimulate and start breaking down the individual.

233
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:24,382
Eventually continues the stimulation so they cannot control the astral body, the ethereal body, delusion starts, fear, tremendous panic.

234
01:01:24,450 --> 01:01:46,770
This panic is one of the worst. Only Aconite during the crisis that they get, they get from time to time the Aconite crisis, can match the fear of that. That's why you will give Aconite many times in cases of Cann-i.

235
01:01:49,740 --> 01:02:03,682
You will give Kali arsenicum or Nitric acid because you will confuse it with tremendous anxiety that you feel that they have

236
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:14,272
where the underlying cause is loss of control. When you have that, you have a very good symptom for Cann-i.

237
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:37,612
Phosphoric acid has also this ethereal kind of disconnectedness but you will not get the extreme panic that accompanies Cann-i. symptomatology.

238
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:47,212
Not all people that they will have these kind of experiences will go into such panic.

239
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:56,212
When you see that then you have the idea of Cann-i.

240
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:18,692
Now how it behaves in their sexual life? Because Cann-i. affects primarily the mind and the sexual sphere.

241
01:03:21,810 --> 01:03:25,002
On the first stage what it will do?

242
01:03:36,830 --> 01:03:52,392
Stimulate the sexual energies and you will have a kind of person that you may be thinking of Platina.

243
01:03:55,030 --> 01:04:14,462
They need a lot of sex and the woman for instance can have successive orgasms and the more they get an orgasm, the more they seek.

244
01:04:15,580 --> 01:04:20,392
They will say, I need a deeper and deeper orgasm.

245
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:28,092
And you may say that this is happening usually. No.

246
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:46,032
In Cann-i. cases it is very strong. They are never satisfied with one or two orgasms. They need to keep on, so the more the pleasure, the more they seek.

247
01:04:49,370 --> 01:04:55,992
In this stage Cann-i. seeks out pleasure.

248
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:11,532
In this first stage also you will see the individual but it will not give it to you as a symptom, just taking the case

249
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:17,012
watching the case, getting information about the case, then you will perceive these things.

250
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:39,832
He will say that I'm doing meditation and in meditation sometimes I feel very well. They have a kind of serenity, beauty, a sense of great beauty which comes upon them.

251
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:54,182
You will see a person for instance that has such sexual energy and they seek for meditation and it has that beauty kind of experiences.

252
01:06:01,430 --> 01:06:13,482
And they are quite basic in their attitude and contact with the other sex. The instinct is quite stimulated.

253
01:06:13,550 --> 01:06:24,892
Actually it's a hormonal almost stimulation and they know what they seek, they seek pleasure in sex and they try to have it.

254
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:27,562
This is the first stage.

255
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:44,602
The second stage where the person, especially when you find these ideas of theorizing, all kinds of theories;

256
01:06:44,670 --> 01:06:53,002
 it seems that the intellect interferes with the sexual center and makes a mess out of it.

257
01:06:53,070 --> 01:07:15,262
And while they still need sex, they intellectualize so much in a kind of relationship, they will say and do things that is like interfering with that function

258
01:07:15,330 --> 01:07:35,722
which is usually straightforward and normal, they will interfere. If they describe to you a Cann-i. case, the other person, will tell how confused the person looks upon these subjects.

259
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:46,162
They will not say, let's have sex. They will theorize, they will bring on cases after cases, they will say this and that.

260
01:07:46,230 --> 01:08:01,812
And the other person most probably will disconnect but Cann-i., as they imagine things, they get involved into situations

261
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:14,992
where in spite of the other person - I mean in a relationship it has to be two persons that they agree on this.

262
01:08:16,790 --> 01:08:42,002
The Cann-i. is so much involved intellectually, he wants sex but the other person disconnects, the Cann-i. person intellectualizes, does not see the reality it and makes advances to the other person.

263
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:54,992
The other person withdraws more and more and they can get into terrible states of crying, laughing, hysterical stage.

264
01:08:56,900 --> 01:09:02,692
In the end the other person will say, what's happening, you are not well, why don't you go to a doctor?

265
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:10,512
You see now the theorizing, the intellectualization how it interferes?

266
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:20,852
The sexual instinct is at a certain level where other people will say, 'I want sex' and they do sex, nothing more.

267
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:49,902
And the third stage of sexuality where the sexual potency, the sexual power is completely lost, it's a kind of paralysis.

268
01:09:49,970 --> 01:09:58,144
What is left there is an anamnesis, a memory of the sexual desire.

269
01:09:58,310 --> 01:10:04,632
If you say, do you have sexual desire? Mentally they will say no but I remember it was pleasure.

270
01:10:06,590 --> 01:10:13,910
It has been completely gone, paralyzed, not that they have an aversion to sex.

271
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:25,792
 The anamnesis of sex is pleasurable, they do not have the power or the real drive, the real desire.

272
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:54,632
The second stage also after the panicky state, they go into periods of anguish, indescribable anguish.

273
01:10:54,700 --> 01:11:01,652
They don't know what is happening, what they want and eventually into states of depression.

274
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:30,012
These states of depression will lead them to try anything. You tell them try this, try that, meditation techniques, hatha yoga, everything; they will try to get away from this state.

275
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:43,782
Many times they will say meditation helps me but it is a point where I feel my arm is going out and I get scared.

276
01:11:54,540 --> 01:12:08,422
Sometimes they reach a point where they feel the death is near. Death is after a month or two or three more or less.

277
01:12:10,110 --> 01:12:24,199
It's not like Agnus castus that they predict the time of death, they will say after 12 days I will
 die, but the feeling that death is approaching.

278
01:12:24,270 --> 01:12:34,132
You see this coming out of their body is a process of dying. This is how we die.

279
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:50,832
That experience is so real for them that they don't know what's happening; they feel that death is near.

280
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:13,402
Concerning a few things on the head. Apart from that feeling of opening and closing the upper part of the head and the trembling of the head

281
01:13:13,470 --> 01:13:19,572
many times there are shocks like electric shocks through the brain.

282
01:13:22,390 --> 01:13:28,892
And then they complain of a dull heavy headache, especially on the right side.

283
01:13:44,190 --> 01:13:51,632
They have dreams that are clairvoyant dreams.

284
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:59,332
Nightmares in the first part of the sleep.

285
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:08,920
The hearing can be very acute.

286
01:14:12,650 --> 01:14:22,060
An intense thirst and many times you may see in Cann-i. grinding of the teeth.

287
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:38,122
Great weakness, I said they want to lie down all the time and palpitations especially on waking.

288
01:14:44,500 --> 01:15:05,872
Cann-i. will be indicated in impotency, in functional disorders, in phobic neurosis, in diabetes, in hysterical paralysis.

289
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:25,112
You immediately go and give Cann-i.? No, that's the whole thing. The delusions have to have this kind that we described.

290
01:15:29,430 --> 01:15:49,632
Otherwise maybe another remedy may be indicated. Also you would expect, for instance, to feel a Cann-i. as a delusion that the mind and the body are separated.

291
01:15:54,110 --> 01:16:12,032
It has to be in the nature of the remedy to really act. So in case of senility what remedies we expect to act more?

292
01:16:13,530 --> 01:16:17,410
Baryta Carbonica.

293
01:16:17,478 --> 01:16:22,610
Conium.

294
01:16:27,030 --> 01:16:34,520
Alumina. Plumbum also.

295
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:49,832
-Can Cann-i. have suicidal tendencies?

296
01:16:56,140 --> 01:17:11,272
-I've not seen it myself in the cases. I've seen so much fear and panic that they may die that I doubt whether it will really have suicidal tendencies.

297
01:17:12,170 --> 01:17:24,412
They may say 'this is not a life, I can't live that life, this is the end, I can't take anymore, things like that'. But real suicidal tendencies I've not seen.

298
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:45,622
-What proportion of Cannabis cases have you seen as secondary to the person taking the drug and would you say there is a Cann-i. miasm?

299
01:17:51,040 --> 01:18:06,462
-How many in numbers? You ask me a difficult question because I'm dealing with Homeopathy for 25 years so to actually give you numbers is very difficult.

300
01:18:06,530 --> 01:18:21,632
But they are not very many. In proportion how many cases have not taken Cann-i. and they had the state of Cann-i.?

301
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:32,872
And how many they had taken? That proportion is 80 % to 20%. 80% they had taken Cann-i., developed the state.

302
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:42,152
20% they never touched Cann-i. and they developed a state of Cann-i. of the cases that I have seen.

303
01:18:45,490 --> 01:18:55,142
-Do you regard the use of LSD as part of the Cann-i. picture or do you find there is strong differentiation?

304
01:18:58,970 --> 01:19:20,392
-I feel that each drug has its own picture. So in general it may appear similar but unless you have for instance the panic in Cann-i., in these stages, it's not going to act.

305
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:40,510
Where LSD may not have the panic. They may have the out of the body experiences without the panic. In Cann-i. we have to have this fear of loss of control to be effective.

306
01:19:52,580 --> 01:20:16,362
What I wanted to show you the other time was the physical, the astral and the spiritual and what is happening here is the physical body and within it it's the emotional and the mental.

307
01:20:16,430 --> 01:20:28,692
Now the emotional and the mental part they jerk out in experiences and they enter here, still they are connected.

308
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:44,942
They may reach these areas here or here or here or may come as close as this area here but they will never enter the real spiritual realm.

309
01:20:45,010 --> 01:20:53,222
There is nobody who is living on the earth who can be as pure as that and be able to really transcend.

310
01:20:53,290 --> 01:20:58,182
They are grades of experiences and that's certain.

311
01:20:58,250 --> 01:21:13,532
Here up to a certain point you start having spiritual kind of experiences and as you approach the spiritual area, the experiences become more and more powerful.

312
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:27,972
More and more real and more and more instructive but nobody ever lived in the spiritual realm.

313
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:39,462
This is a delusion for my understanding and I have done quite a lot of research, meeting a lot of spiritual people and discussing with them

314
01:21:39,530 --> 01:21:45,362
and having my own experiences, their own experiences.

315
01:21:51,710 --> 01:22:11,662
Here in order to pass through these areas, the areas of fear, darkness, guilt; whilst in the mental emotional part of you there is fear or guilt

316
01:22:11,730 --> 01:22:17,402
all these emotions, as soon as you come out here, you are caught in this area.

317
01:22:17,470 --> 01:22:25,642
You cannot go further up. It's like in your dream, you say I don't like the place where I am but you cannot get out.

318
01:22:25,710 --> 01:22:47,762
So you are graded in whatever emotions you have at the moment. That's why if you want to have spiritual experiences, you have to purify that portion, mostly the astral.

319
01:22:47,830 --> 01:23:03,272
Because that astral portion, that emotional part of us, the psychic part of us carries the spiritual part and that has to be purified.

320
01:23:03,340 --> 01:23:13,752
And that is purified through a lot of work that one has to do upon himself and Cann-i. will not do the trick.

321
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:24,732
If you do it once or twice it's OK. Just give up because you are going to pay by breaking down the mind.

322
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:36,372
Cann-i. definitely has broken down the mind of the people that take it and it has left them with less intellectual powers.

323
01:23:47,690 --> 01:23:51,060
I know that you don't like always to hear.

324
01:23:55,240 --> 01:24:14,268
It's a pity because I believe we have reached a point that we are enough degenerated that through the action upon our bodies

325
01:24:14,270 --> 01:24:33,532
of these drugs, whether it's LSD, cannabis, cocaine, heroin, morphine, amphetamines or Valium, Tavor etc.

326
01:24:34,350 --> 01:24:43,262
we can degenerate further and lose completely the possibility of any kind of evolvement.

327
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:57,662
If we go spiritually, we say if you go through this area eventually then you may be drawn from the spiritual realm, higher.

328
01:24:58,090 --> 01:25:11,770
If you don't manage to reach this area you will be drawn down here. Down here what exists? Death, decomposition, distraction, nothing will be left.

329
01:25:12,910 --> 01:25:19,102
 Your hand will be taken away and the other unless you keep it as a whole here.

330
01:25:21,690 --> 01:25:34,430
To keep it as a whole here you have to work while you are in this earth, not with Cann-i.
