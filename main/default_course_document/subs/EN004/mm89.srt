1
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:40,832
There are skin eruptions which are much more mild and skin eruptions which are the externalization of a dysfunction of a vital organ

2
00:00:41,520 --> 00:01:06,299
like liver or the absorption system which is going wrong or the hormonal system which is going wrong; therefore we have different degree of severity on skin eruptions.

3
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:23,519
I have tried to give you an idea
of a hierarchy of skin eruptions.

4
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:31,519
Which skin eruptions are bad, which
 are good and which are in between.

5
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:37,700
This is not absolute but just as an indication.

6
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:52,359
Which group is the least disturbing?
What's your experience?

7
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:21,309
A group of skin disorders, the simplest, I found that something can be really cured quite easily is just simple cracks of the skin.

8
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:55,039
Another skin disorder which can be easily cured, is ulcers. Ulcers are easily cured and impressively.

9
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:06,089
Even sometimes you have indolent ulcers,
ulcers that are because of a bad circulation.

10
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:14,599
And you find the homeopathic remedy
and you see this ulcer disappearing.

11
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:37,790
And then you have these benign growths,
 like condylomata and warts.

12
00:03:37,791 --> 00:03:44,899
It's another class of skin eruption
 which are easily manageable.

13
00:03:51,600 --> 00:04:21,089
And then another class is carbuncles, boils, which start to be more difficult and then acne, mostly in the face and in the back, quite difficult.

14
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:34,879
Then you have the allergic eruptions. The more you go to these categories, the more difficult.

15
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:48,080
And then you have eczema. Then
you have neuro-dermatitis, worse.

16
00:04:48,990 --> 00:05:01,399
Herpetic eruptions. Psoriasis.
 Lupus erythematosus.

17
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:20,279
And finally malignant growths like epithelioma and also the Kaposi's sarcoma which appears in the last stages of AIDS.

18
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,999
Malignant growths in general which
you are treating really cancer.

19
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:40,109
So we shall be talking in the next hour about these different groups of skin eruptions and I will give you some indications of how you may be dealing with them.

20
00:05:51,190 --> 00:06:05,209
We're talking about cracks, cases where you will see as the main skin problem, cracking of the skin.

21
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:22,849
The two main remedies that you will be thinking in such a case where the cracking of the skin is very apparent and very prominent, will be Sars. and Petr.

22
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:49,939
Also other remedies that should come to your mind is Calc., Carb-s., Graph., Nit-ac., Puls., Sep. and Sulph.

23
00:06:49,940 --> 00:07:03,559
Concerning Sulph. I would like to make a general remark. I would say always look for Sulph. and give it with great caution.

24
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:14,899
Sulph. covers every skin eruption that you can imagine and it may be indicated, but may be.

25
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:26,309
Be aware of Sulph. because it will come prominent every time but it's not that every time is indicated.

26
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:37,519
As a general idea have in mind that Sulph. eruptions usually are accompanied by itching.

27
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:45,019
It's very seldom that you will see a skin eruption that requires Sulph. and there is no itching.

28
00:07:47,690 --> 00:08:12,199
I shall be mentioning in my remarks many times, Sulph. but you have to be very careful because Sulph. can take care of the local eruption, without being really indicated.

29
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:24,239
Most probably in most of the cases it will aggravate the case, it will make the skin eruption much bigger without real amelioration.

30
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:37,759
You see in Homeopathy when you have an aggravation is very good. With Sulph. what happens is usually you say, oh you have an aggravation that's very good.

31
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:47,079
And the aggravation comes 1 day, 2 days, 2, 3 weeks, 5 months, nothing happens. That's no good.

32
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:57,319
That means that the remedy was close but not exact. So Sulph. can really aggravate the case without bringing about cure.

33
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:13,149
Sometimes also you will see taking away a portion of the eruption. It will take away the itching, it will take away some local eruptions.

34
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:24,499
From one locality it will take it away, another locality will stay. That kind of reaction be aware,  is not a curative response.

35
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:35,829
In order to have a curative response with skin eruptions, you will have to have an aggravation which does not last  usually more than one week.

36
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:44,259
It's very seldom that this aggravation will continue for more than 2 or 3 weeks.

37
00:09:44,260 --> 00:10:02,569
And then always when that is a curative aggravation, always there is an amelioration on the mental, emotional level, the general state of health and the general energy.

38
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:11,349
So a good response from a remedy will be accompanied by an amelioration of other levels.

39
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:16,919
Energy, general state,
mental-emotional state.

40
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:41,899
When I mention remedies, I will give a few hints here and there in different eruptions. It does not mean that these are the only remedies that are going to be indicated in such a case.

41
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:48,779
There are other remedies as well but
I mention the most prominent ones.

42
00:10:50,860 --> 00:11:11,489
And also examine your case in its general picture, in its mental-emotional picture and try to fit everything with the remedy that you're deciding.

43
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:14,939
Don't just go and give.

44
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:24,249
Sometimes there are some good results by using one keynote. For instance you're using Petr. for cracks but Petr. will not do the case.

45
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:43,599
Cracks that come only during winter. In Sars. goes away.

46
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:54,624
I told you Sars. is the main remedy for cracks. Deep cracks, constant cracks. Especially where? In the feet. The cracks of Sars. are in the feet.

47
00:11:56,288 --> 00:12:06,789
Petr. it can be anywhere. Now if the cracks are worse in winter, then it becomes Petr. more.

48
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:24,979
And also Calc. because of the aggravation from cold. Also Sep. comes now into picture.
And Carb-s. also.

49
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:41,359
If the cracks are very painful, Sars. comes into picture, with Petr. second and then Nit-ac.  comes into the picture.

50
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:57,169
If the cracks are in the heel of the foot,
which other remedy is very prominent?

51
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:10,519
It's Lyc.. Also another remedy which is
not in the Repertory. It's Calc-f.

52
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:31,649
But if the cracks are on the tips of the fingers, the remedy that is the number one you would think, is Graph.

53
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:50,740
But if the cracks are general in the hand, fingers in general and hand, then again Petr., Calc. and Sars.

54
00:13:55,270 --> 00:14:19,159
if you have a case where the cracks are mostly on the bends of the elbows and the back of the knee, the remedy - we had such a case in Belgium - Graph.

55
00:14:40,410 --> 00:15:03,420
In ulcers in general, I'll give you a few general pictures like Ars. it's very good remedy. Anthrac., is another one. Carb-v. also due to bad circulation. Hepar.

56
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:20,889
 Kali-s. and Kali-bi.,
Lach., Merc., Nit-ac. Phyt.

57
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:29,430
Puls., Sil., Sulph. again.

58
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:44,749
But if the ulcer is blackish, it has a black
color, which is the main remedy?

59
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:51,779
Anthrac. Carb-v. also can
be there and also Lach.

60
00:15:53,840 --> 00:16:05,099
But if this blackish color is all around the
 ulcer, then it becomes mostly Lach.

61
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:17,179
And of course the bluish, red color
 belongs to Lach., also Ars. and Sil.

62
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:40,369
If these ulcers are burning, usually the pain is burning but when it's excessively burning, it's like fire, then the main remedies are Anthrac., Ars. and Tarent-c.

63
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:55,490
You see I give you mostly my experience,
I don't give you all the remedies that are in the Repertory. You will find a lot of other remedies as well.

64
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:17,099
Every eruption that will be ameliorated by cold application, cold water, any eruption and ulcers, will be mostly Led. and Puls.

65
00:17:39,390 --> 00:18:01,960
The color of the discharge can become important, especially if there are peculiar colors like blackish discharge, we have Anthrac., Sulph., Lyc. Sometimes Bry.

66
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:17,429
When the discharge is of grayish color, it's
one remedy which is very important, Caust.

67
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:30,940
And green discharge we have Ars.,
 Nat-s.  main remedies.

68
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:59,499
Discharge which smells like old cheese is one remedy, Hep. And when the discharge is sourish smelling, which are the remedies?

69
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:08,649
Calc., Hep. and in this particular
case Merc. also can be indicated.

70
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:50,959
When you have boils, carbuncles, boils that come repeatedly in the history of the patient, you have boils breaking out and again and they retreat, they break again.

71
00:19:50,960 --> 00:20:03,499
And there is a history of boils in general, the remedy that you will be thinking is Hep. and Sulph.

72
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:21,589
Also Calc-s.  Brom., Merc., Calc. as well.

73
00:20:33,560 --> 00:21:17,010
Boils that are enormous in size and of a texture which is....you palpate the boil and the boil is quite full and movable within the muscular structure

74
00:21:17,011 --> 00:21:37,199
but absolutely it's not defused there. It's a hard mass with excessive burning pain, is Anthrac.

75
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:59,379
Boils, carbuncles and this kind of skin eruptions are still not very difficult to manage, to handle.

76
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:07,359
Usually they have a good
 prognosis and good reactions.

77
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:29,289
There is another type of this disorder which is a generalized state of carbuncles. It's called hidradenitis.

78
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:47,739
It usually appears in axillae and on the inguinal region and eventually progresses and occupies the whole body.

79
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:58,080
Disfigures the body and especially the face it becomes completely disfigured, the nose.

80
00:22:58,081 --> 00:23:06,219
This is a state which looks like carbuncles or boils but actually it's a much more serious condition

81
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:17,059
and it's not easily manageable by Homeopathy though we can have definitely quite a lot of success with this disease.

82
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:35,849
We may see long periods of aggravations. In this disease you may start in a case and you may give up very soon because of the aggravation which takes place.

83
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:48,419
And unless you persist for several years, you are not going to see real results in such cases.

84
00:23:48,420 --> 00:24:01,089
This disease, as I said, is called hidradenitis and it looks like carbuncles or boils but it is not, it's a much deeper state of disorder.

85
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:23,229
In this case we have keloids. It's like smallpox. Every boil leaves a mark and many times the marks are keloids, much stronger.

86
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:44,319
Therefore we have remedies like Graph. and
 Sil., Calc-s., Calc. which can be indicated.

87
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:57,409
I have found also in this type of cases, you will have the need of a series of remedies. It's not one remedy that will do it.

88
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:14,979
It's a series of remedies and my experience in such cases of hidradenitis is that there is a lot of emotional problems.

89
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:23,950
Usually a woman and they are loaded with emotions which were never expressed.

90
00:25:23,951 --> 00:25:36,799
Very strong emotions that were never expressed and it seems that the body expresses this kind of emotions through these boils

91
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:42,710
that can become tremendously
big and disfigure the whole face.

92
00:25:42,711 --> 00:25:55,290
I mean you can see a boil budging out from here and there and eventually when it will go down you will have a bigger or a smaller mark.

93
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:08,530
They will need to be treated on several layers. The 1st remedy, the 2nd remedy, the 3rd remedy, the 4th remedy and after 2-3 years

94
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:22,549
 of treating such cases you may really notice some changes coming about. Once you treat them successfully in the beginning, you will have a big aggravation.

95
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:38,979
You don't see these aggravations with common boils or recurrent  carbuncles which we see in other cases. It's quite easy to have them.

96
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:17,499
We now come to eczema which is one of the most common skin eruptions that you will be treating.

97
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:41,159
Here the successes will become less because at this moment the general state of health is not strong enough to give you a clear picture of the remedy.

98
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:47,329
Eczematous cases they
don't give out a clear picture.

99
00:27:50,590 --> 00:28:04,049
In these cases you have definitely to take into consideration general mental-emotional symptoms before you can find the remedy.

100
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:11,780
And also it is my experience in treating cases that they have been treated before by other homeopaths.

101
00:28:11,781 --> 00:28:24,749
It's my experience that eczema after being treated for many years with Homeopathy it can
 in a way be suppressed, in one way or another.

102
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:42,479
 I'm going to show you a case on video, with a child with eczema that the eczema was treated and it developed some chest problems.

103
00:28:44,180 --> 00:29:04,509
Some asthma and then eventually he developed some personality disorders and I will show you how the disease went inside and how the disease will come outside during  treatment.

104
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:17,019
Remedies for the eczema,
 here we have to mention first Sulph.

105
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:28,299
Sulph. is the number one remedy that will be covering about 25% of the cases of eczema.

106
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:51,099
Other remedy which is very prominently indicated and has severe kind of eczema, especially in the face, around the eyes, the eyebrows, is Mez.

107
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:23,789
Of course again remedies like Graph. and Sep. Sep. actually is one of the best skin remedies and it will be indicated in many many conditions.

108
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:43,409
Eczema will be treated with Dulc. also. Dulc. many times will be indicated, especially if the eczema or the condition has come after an exposure to cold wet.

109
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:49,750
The same with Rhus-t.

110
00:30:52,970 --> 00:31:07,219
Again Ars., Ars-i., Calc., Calc-s., Hep.
and both Jug-c. and Jug-r.

111
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:20,809
Olnd., Petr., Psor.

112
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:31,369
But here again you have to individualize and go to the Repertory. You will have to work with the Repertory.

113
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:43,639
I don't know how many of you are working with the Repertory but I don't believe that anybody can have in his mind the information which is given in our Materia Medicas.

114
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:54,239
Therefore it's absolutely necessary to use the Repertory. So going into the Repertory you will see a lot of modifications of these remedies.

115
00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:07,159
It will give you a lot of information. I' m just giving you highlights now which is on my experience, what remedies will come mostly prominent in such cases.

116
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:28,449
In carbuncles I forgot to give you another
 remedy which is very important. It's Tarent-c.

117
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,749
Did I speak about Tarent-c.?

118
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:53,849
Carbunlces that are discharging but still are very much painful, burning, Tarent-c. will be together with Anthrac.

119
00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:08,719
Then Ars. and then Crot-c. and Apis
 and Lach. of course will be indicated.

120
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:28,669
And we'll have remedies also that they will have a predisposition to alternate between skin eruptions and internal disorders.

121
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:47,010
Mostly if you see duodenal ulcer state alternating with skin eruptions or if you see immediately a relationship between

122
00:33:47,011 --> 00:33:58,739
a suppressed skin eruption and the almost immediate appearance of a duodenal ulcer within 2-3 months after the eruption was gone,

123
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:06,879
 the duodenal ulcer appears.
That is a keynote of Graph.

124
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:13,519
You can be almost sure,
certain that the remedy will be Graph.

125
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:32,769
Another characteristic of Graph. is when,  usually Graph. has discharge, it has a wet eczema, with a lot of discharge.

126
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:45,849
And the discharge is sticky, they describe it like honey. Sticky and yellowish, brown color.

127
00:34:45,850 --> 00:35:02,429
Wet eczema also you will find in Lyc.,
 in Dulc., Kreos. also. And of course Sulph.

128
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:25,159
But if the discharge is very thin, like watery discharge, then the remedies will be Crot-h. or Tarent-c. again.

129
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:38,939
If the discharge from the eczema, everything
 that comes out is yellowish, this is Rhus-v.

130
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:57,650
Also Cupr. has this yellow discharge.

131
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:16,969
What is in Rhus-t. and Rhus-v.? Both they have a peculiarity, where the itching which both these remedies produce very intensely

132
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:27,619
the itching is ameliorated if they put the part which is itchy in very hot water.

133
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:37,379
Almost boiling water. They can just bear the heat. They put inside and that is the only time where they get an amelioration.

134
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:43,649
This is a characteristic of Rhus-t. or Rhus-v.

135
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:56,580
Ars. also is better in warm applications.

136
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:13,430
The characteristic of Olnd. is that the eczema appears mostly on the top of the head. And the eczema is mostly in children or in babies.

137
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:26,479
Another characteristic is also that there are thick crusts, very thick crusts, under which if you lift them, there is oozing.

138
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:40,929
And then we have allergic reactions, allergic conditions which some remedies produce.

139
00:37:49,180 --> 00:38:24,700
And if we have a generalized rash, red rash, as an allergic condition, the first remedy that we will be thinking is Puls., Apis, Chlor., Bell., Vesp. and Rhus-t.

140
00:38:24,701 --> 00:38:36,629
Of course Sulph. Sulph. always is there.
Even if I don't mention, Sulph. is there.

141
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:56,469
There is another remedy in generalized urticaria, where especially the urticaria is small, red bumps.

142
00:38:56,470 --> 00:39:13,050
Full of little bumps raised and it becomes red, whole areas of little bumps raised of an allergic type of an eruption

143
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:24,999
with intense itching, there is a remedy
 which we have to think, is Astac.

144
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,960
Do you know what it is?

145
00:39:27,961 --> 00:39:44,849
Lobster. You have seen lobster? The color of lobster more or less has that type of appearance in small spots.

146
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:52,959
A generalized state. Astacus Fluviatilis.

147
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:36,869
If the urticaria affects mostly the extremities, then Chlor. becomes very important, Crot-c.,  Med., Cop., Lach. and Apis.

148
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:49,880
These remedies become important with
 the most terrifying of this, the Crot-c.

149
00:40:49,881 --> 00:41:06,159
where the urticaria can take enormous patches that become very red and really looking fiery red.

150
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:24,009
You will see the thigh, the whole thigh is swollen in a place. Crot-c. of course has a mental picture that goes with it.

151
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:42,569
A lot of fears, a lot of delusions almost with fears. We cannot give all the information about these remedies, I'm just giving you indications.

152
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:57,719
For instance if an urticaria or an allergic reaction comes mostly in the night, then we have Apis as the main remedy.

153
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:20,370
Bov. is a remedy that has an interesting condition in allergic reaction where the itching is so tremendous that a person has to scratch, scratch

154
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:32,090
and then there is tremendous anxiety in this person.  The person is in a great state of anxiety, in excitement at the same time.

155
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:55,970
 And this itching comes and the body
 breaks out to this eruption and this scratch bleeds and creates little wounds.

156
00:42:55,971 --> 00:43:04,409
The whole body all the time from scratching
 looks with little wounds all over the places.

157
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:20,429
Bovista also has another characteristic which is a kind of awkwardness. They become very awkward.

158
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:28,959
They want to take this and before they take this, they throw this, that one, then they catch this.

159
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:37,519
They don't direct their extremities very much.

160
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:57,329
If a case of asthma alternating with skin eruptions of an allergic type. An allergic asthma with a kind or urticaria alternating.

161
00:43:57,330 --> 00:44:05,609
When the urticaria is out, the asthma is better, when the asthma is on, the urticaria is not there.

162
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:14,749
Then we have Apis again and
Calad. and possibly Graph.

163
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:32,259
An urticaria which comes every time a person takes a bath is mostly Lach., an Urt-u. as well and Phos.

164
00:44:44,780 --> 00:45:01,929
An allergic reaction that comes in cold air, as soon as the person gets cold, the reaction starts, then we have Rhus-t., a possibility of Nit-ac. or Sep.

165
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:24,689
Amelioration with cold air will be Dolich.
 and
 Kali-bi. And sometimes Calc.

166
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:41,739
But allergic condition that comes after cold
 and wet mostly Dulc., possibly Calc-p., Calc.

167
00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:59,319
An allergic reaction that comes after exertion
is mostly Con., Merc., Nat-m., Psor., Urt-u.

168
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:30,909
Ant-c. has a reaction to meat. People allergic to meat in general, we have to be thinking of Ant-c. with a desire for cucumber.

169
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:44,610
Excessive desire for cucumber
and allergic reaction to meat.

170
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:50,050
We have allergic conditions
 that come before menses.

171
00:46:50,270 --> 00:47:04,589
Again Nat-m. which is very well known for
a reaction before menses, Kali-c. and Dulc.

172
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:21,519
If you happen to have travel case where there is nausea preceding the skin eruption, there is nausea or vomiting and then the skin eruption breaks out, then the remedy is Sang.

173
00:47:50,500 --> 00:48:04,399
This type of allergic conditions you may be finding some of the cases are very stubborn and you may be battling for years before you can really bring them around.

174
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:32,129
They are not easy cases but don't forget Medorrhinum is one of the best remedies for this kind of allergic conditions where we have the swelling of the area which is inflamed.

175
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:41,680
And of course better
in the sea will be a keynote.

176
00:48:45,860 --> 00:49:08,520
In urticaria I would think that a remedy like
 Apis, most frequently indicated is Apis, Med.

177
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:29,069
Dulc., Urt-u. and Puls.

178
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:35,839
I would say these out of the most
frequently indicated remedies.

179
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:40,969
-In what potency?

180
00:49:43,910 --> 00:50:00,799
-The potency, as long as you find the remedy, the potency always is going to act, whether you give 6X, 12, 30, 200 or 1M, 10M.

181
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:20,719
One observation in potencies also, I would say in skin eruptions, you do not have to go very high. 200 is a good potency to work with skin eruptions.

182
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:34,839
Also you can start with 30 and find out because some allergic people are so sensitive that they may have big reactions.

183
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:56,619
In general herpes zoster is Ran-b., Rhus-t., Variol. also one of the main remedies and Thuja.

184
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:04,389
Possibilities Merc., Lach., Ars., Graph.

185
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:19,936
If it happens they have a periodicity, mostly is Ars., possibility of Merc. and Phyto.

186
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:48,969
If you have cancerous affections of the skin, like epithelioma, Hydr. is an interesting remedy, Con., Kali-s., Lyc., Ars-i.

187
00:51:56,650 --> 00:52:22,399
For melanoma we have Lach., again Con.,
 Crot-h., Arg-n., Kali-p., Calc., Ars., Merc., Sulph.

188
00:52:31,580 --> 00:53:06,133
If you go to lupus erythematosus, Nit-ac., Thuj., main remedies, Hydroc., also, Lyc., Sep., Phyto., Ars., Kali-cl.

189
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:25,929
For vitiligo, you will not cure vitiligo. All this as we go further to more serious conditions, we have less and less successes with homeopathic remedy.

190
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:34,459
In vitiligo for instance,
I have seen two cases cured.

191
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:47,259
Usually I don't see for vitiligo but on the side you see the progress of vitiligo and you see whether they are curing or not.

192
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:57,299
Vitiligo which is spread already 5-10 years,
 15 years very little. It can regress but very little.

193
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:11,579
In children is another story because you get it very early. The child is reacting easily and I find Sep. is one of the main remedies for vitiligo in children.

194
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:41,859
The main remedies here will be of use like Sulph., Calc., Aur., Ars., Alum., sometimes Phos., Nat-m., Nat-c., Merc., Sil.

195
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:55,289
-Syphilinum?
-You can say it yes.

196
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:19,489
I have seen, as I said, some regression in vitiligo or I have seen a few cases, maybe there are 4 or 5 but very few cases that I see in grownups that the condition was taken away completely.

197
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:40,079
For psoriasis the main remedy is again Sep. Sep. why? Because Sep. produces scaly eruptions very strongly, dry eruptions and scaly.

198
00:55:40,080 --> 00:56:05,489
Remedies that produce this state of affairs are good for psoriasis. Ars., Ars-i, Aur., Aur-m., Bar-c., Calc., Calc-s, Led., Mez., Phos., Sep., Sil.

199
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:16,110
Phyto. also is one of the main remedies.
Phyto. is very much similar with Merc.

200
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:36,159
Lyc. also you will see some times indicated. In acute cases, sometimes the psoriasis takes a very severe form with real inflammation

201
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:43,469
and you see the inguinal glands get swollen up because of the inflammation going on in the whole body.

202
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:55,679
The inguinal glands become swollen and there is a burning sensation and aggressive heat and pain in the whole body.

203
00:56:55,680 --> 00:57:06,189
That can be ameliorated by Bell. and most probably we have to continue with Calc.

204
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:18,739
Another remedy is also Clem.

205
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:49,529
Ringworms, the main remedy is Bac. here. And Rad-b. also when the eruption is absolutely circular.

206
00:57:49,530 --> 00:58:00,749
It's a circular eruption, an exact circle and it appears in different places and it becomes an exact circle.

207
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:13,119
Nat-m. also, Phyto., Sep., Tell.
 also and Tub. of course.

208
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:23,570
Then in lower degree
Bar-c., Calc. and Graph.

209
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:43,839
Herpetic eruptions that come during fever. If during fever you have a herpetic eruption appearing, then it's going to be Nat-m.

210
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:51,259
Nat-m. also is the main remedy
for producing herpes in the lips.

211
00:58:53,860 --> 00:59:02,920
If the herpetic eruption appears with a lot of itching, then we have Clem., Rhus-t. and Sep.

212
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:34,769
The case of ichthyosis is another serious state and it requires a lot of treatment perhaps

213
00:59:34,770 --> 00:59:45,379
 but the main remedy that will almost cure will almost take care of 50% of the cases, is Phos.

214
00:59:48,970 --> 00:59:59,529
Ichthyosis is a congenital disease which
is quite severe with a lot of scales.

215
00:59:59,530 --> 01:00:10,239
I remember one of my first cases that
needed Phos. in ascending potencies.

216
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:28,349
That was the only case that I had to prescribe 4M or something like that, which I don't know what kind of potency is this but anyhow she needed ascending potencies.

217
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:45,869
Unfortunately, due to the fact that we do not have a scientifically produced homeopathic remedy, that means we know that this remedy has been potentized 10.000 times exactly

218
01:00:45,870 --> 01:00:56,649
because of that fact we cannot know exactly what happens. When we say we gave CM potency, 100.000 potency, 1.000.000 potency,

219
01:00:56,650 --> 01:01:10,639
we don't really know whether this remedy was really potentized 1.000.000 times or it was just said that it was potentized 1.000.000 times.

220
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:23,460
But Phos. I have noticed that in ichthyosis acts very well and usually the ichthyosis cases need Phos. in great percentage.
