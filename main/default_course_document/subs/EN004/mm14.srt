1
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:47,359
It's exactly the opposite of Cocc. Both are worse from sleeplessness but the one becomes oversensitive

2
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:54,589
to external impressions and the impressions travel very fast, The other one becomes slow and signals are

3
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:07,292
travelling very slow, Cocc. very slow, Coff. very fast.

4
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:20,429
That is why the Coff. is a remedy for over excited people, that they get over excited very easily.

5
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,789
Over excitement with the least cause to such an extent that will bring tears.

6
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:38,399
The excitement brings tears even if it's a good excitement, a joyful excitement, then they break out into crying.

7
00:01:42,170 --> 00:02:02,689
Coff. hightens the senses so they are over smelling, over tasting, over hearing, over seeing.

8
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:29,459
It is the remedy which is the fastest in mind. A lot of thinking, a lot of ideas go on through the mind and the Coff. people

9
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:47,299
 can stay awake from an activity of the mind. So you get over excited, over active, sleepless and at the same time

10
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:53,949
hearing very acutely, smelling very acutely, seeing very acutely.

11
00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:12,559
Then of course the headaches start and it says from mental exertion. It is not only from mental exertion

12
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:20,960
 because once they are becoming a habit, they are coming due to this over excitement of the mind.

13
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:38,919
One sided headaches usually as if a nail is driven but this is not only.

14
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:47,639
It can have any type of headache, not only a headache as if a nail is driven.

15
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:56,880
Which is the remedy which looks like Coff.?

16
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:19,689
Nux-v., very good. Nux-v. looks very similar but Coff. lacks the aggressiveness of Nux-v. Nux-v. is aggressive.

17
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:28,669
 Many times is almost hard, malicious.

18
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:46,319
It says ecstasy. You see the joyful over-excitement, it can reach a very high state.

19
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:53,119
So these are the individuals who need Coff.

20
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:14,989
It says aggravation from noise, why? Because the hearing is so acute, it's not a kind of fear from noise.

21
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,810
Fear from noise which the remedy that has?

22
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:39,219
Borax. For different reasons.

23
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:55,919
In this, the aggravation from noise is like another remedy which we have not spoken about, Ther. and Asar.

24
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:29,879
This remedy is worse also from loss of sleep; they cannot sleep. Sleeplessness with headaches come

25
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:39,229
and couple with over excitement, these three essentials make a case for Coff.

26
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:21,409
Coloc. is a remedy that affects the colon. It's a remedy that inflames the colon, a remedy for spastic colitis

27
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:37,899
with severe pains which are better when the patient draws up the legs and keep and press them in the abdomen.

28
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:50,399
And presses hard in the abdomen, then it can retain a little bit the pain. Otherwise the pain is unbearable.

29
00:07:52,240 --> 00:08:10,499
It's a remedy that belongs to people who are angry. There is a lot of anger inside the Coloc. which is expressed

30
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:22,799
actually in every day life. That's why it says, 'become angry when questioned'.

31
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:30,839
This is an idea, it gives you the idea of an
 angry person that says, 'leave me alone'.

32
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:53,589
And people who have gone through some bad experiences and they did not express at the moment all the anger

33
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:57,679
because it's very difficult to express the anger in many cases.

34
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:13,619
Especially in northern people, the Israelis don't have so much problem. You just do something to them...

35
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:32,929
It's a spasmodic remedy in different parts of the body. Also it is a remedy which will be useful many times in lumbago

36
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:51,679
 but especially sciaticas. Severe cramping pains which are alternating with numbness. Numbness and pain together

37
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:57,360
or alternating of severe pains and then numbness starts.

38
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:12,890
 Of course these colic pains that we get in the children.

39
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:23,489
If they are severe and the baby does this movement, then this remedy is indicated.

40
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:38,439
If the baby has colic pains and you turn him around and put him to sleep against his abdomen, then it is Bell.

41
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:55,679
Illicium also is a remedy for baby colic. It's a herb actually which the mothers used to give to the babies, in the old times.

42
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:10,360
Shooting pains, worse on the left side.

43
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:32,839
-Some Homeopaths say that Coloc. is similar to Staph. in some way and it is a remedy for ailments for humiliation.

44
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:50,489
-Humiliation yes. I would say if anger is kept inside, then it's Coloc. If humiliation is kept inside

45
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:57,480
 the main idea is 'I'm humiliated', then it's Staph.

46
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:20,519
The remedies sometimes, Caust., Staph. and Coloc., are indicated in one case.

47
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:36,520
As we saw that case with Nat-m. and then we go to Nit-ac. And then the other case Nat-m. and then Phos.

48
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,840
And then the other case Calc-p. and then Phos.

49
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:59,839
In this way these 3 remedies are in a rotation. That means symptoms change in such a way, because you say

50
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:11,809
Caust. is a revolutionist, he does not suppress himself. Staph. suppresses himself, how is that possible

51
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:20,619
that they complement each other? In spite of that fact it happens that they complement each other.

52
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:28,259
Not only that but you may see a case where you start with Caust., you go to Staph. or you start with Staph.,

53
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:32,760
you go to Caust., then you go to Coloc.

54
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:47,759
You may see these 3 remedies in a rotation and sometimes in serious conditions where the organism is really undermined

55
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:54,919
 then you have this peculiar phenomenon. Where you try a series of remedies and then

56
00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:03,479
  you start again on higher potency, the same cycle. And then there is a better push.

57
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:15,679
This happens in serious cases. When I say serious cases you have not to think of death. Who is near death, serious.
