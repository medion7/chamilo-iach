1
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:06,160
You see capricious. The word capricious should be more, exaggerated.

2
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,041
You have the keys in your hands? They want the keys.

3
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:33,281
OK, take them. They take the keys and throw them away. That type is the Cina.

4
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:42,791
You remember the difference between Calc-p. and Cina?

5
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:54,560
'I want the cream'. It takes the cream, throws it away.

6
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:15,490
Why? Because most probably there is an irritation on the nervous system which does not allow them a minute of peace.

7
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,640
They are grinding the teeth in the night.

8
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:47,131
They are boring the finger into the nose and itching in the rectum because of the worms.

9
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:58,611
The worms are eating them up. Can you imagine an organism full of worms?

10
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,640
You can't get rid of them.

11
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:25,590
This state, the state of Cina if you can imagine. Because it is the remedy par excellence for worms. Pin worms.

12
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:40,761
The little worms that they eat you up and
their nervous system is so irritated with all this

13
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:52,321
and in the night irritation and what we say, capriciousness. They don't know what happens to them.

14
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:31,201
You will get this in the children so exaggerated. But you will get the same condition in the grown up

15
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,841
 this capriciousness irritation, they don't want this and that.

16
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,441
You give this, they are not satisfied, you give that, they are not satisfied.

17
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,231
- Will they grind their teeth during the day?

18
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:59,201
During the day also. But especially during the night, during sleep.

19
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:19,561
They do not understand the situation. I have seen such cases in India. They don't realize that the child is under this condition

20
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,781
and they go into convulsions finally.

21
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:32,961
If this state is allowed to continue, they go into real convulsions and they stay convulsed.

22
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:58,361
Of course we have to use words but for every case, we have to get the essence, what we tell, that particularity of the case.

23
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:13,760
You say, this is Aur., this is Calc-p., this is Cham., this is Cina.

24
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:35,851
- Is it possible to heal pin worms just by giving Cina and in what potency?

25
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:44,321
-It is possible to get out the pinworms yes.
-What potency then?

26
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:52,160
-What was the question?
-What potency shall we give if it is for killing worms?

27
00:06:52,600 --> 00:07:00,721
-From 200 upwards, 1M, 10M, 50M, CM if it is a child.

28
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:10,321
We shall be talking tomorrow a little bit more theory and maybe we reach the point where eventually

29
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:19,210
will give you some measurements or parameters for using potencies.

30
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,440
Cramps on all levels.

31
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:22,120
Cramped emotions, cramped thinking.

32
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:42,781
 Cramps so severe, you get in the night persons who will make a movement in their legs, simple movement

33
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:56,621
 to turn in bed and put the feet and that moment the cramp starts and it keeps on increasing until you shout.

34
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:13,561
 That kind of cramps because other remedies like Caust. has also cramps in the night, in bed.  Calc. has also cramps in bed

35
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:25,281
 but now in this remedy we're talking that the main symptom, the main theme that you will see is cramps.

36
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,240
It's a person who is cramped.

37
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:46,201
 The emotions have been cramped and no release.

38
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:08,600
They are passionate people with extreme sexuality.

39
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,521
 This can terrify them.

40
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:27,271
A woman who wakes up in this sexuality and suddenly she thinks it's so terrible, I have to do something.

41
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:45,001
Then the fear is such from the feelings that she takes it back and then after that, we see total frigidity.

42
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:57,351
Therefore the person remains in a cramped state.

43
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:06,690
And every now and then, you see this.

44
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:20,651
Cramps are starting in the extremities and eventually they end up around the solar plexus.

45
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:36,431
Then tremendous cramps, the same crying, deep crying of the emotions.

46
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:53,331
And they cramp emotionally, cramps all the time and then automatic cramps. Cramps in the stomach.

47
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:03,421
Cramping pain in the stomach you see, suffering for years.

48
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:30,161
Convulsions of course. And convulsions are ending with extreme flow of urine.

49
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:51,501
Also if skin eruptions are not left to express themselves, that means cortisone and whatever allopathic remedies

50
00:12:51,580 --> 00:13:02,601
are used and after this you have epileptic fits, convulsions of any kind, cramps of any kind, after suppressed eruption

51
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:06,461
usually the remedy is Cuprum.

52
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:29,351
If you don't have only convulsions but you have mostly twichings and also restlessness, is Zinc.

53
00:13:42,190 --> 00:14:02,521
You suppress any discharge. You suppress the monthly period, convulsions. You suppress the perspiration, convulsions.

54
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:17,201
So whenever you have discharges or eruptions which are suppressed and there is a result, you see convulsions of any kind.

55
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:30,061
It can be epileptic or any other convulsions. Or cramps. A pattern that starts with cramps, this is Cuprum.

56
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:45,681
- Are the cramps that you are telling us about reaction of the body, of the organism to some great need

57
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:51,321
or some trying to do or to feel something which is not allowed?

58
00:14:54,980 --> 00:15:12,281
-Yes correct. You are not allowed to feel this. You put it well, you understood exactly the meaning. You are not allowed to feel this.

59
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:24,041
And then cramps, convulsions. But you understand the intensity of the feeling and the intensity of the suppression.

60
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:30,611
Intense feeling, intense suppression it ends up into convulsions.

61
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:46,821
You have to get to the idea of the remedies and then you become fantastic prescribers.

62
00:15:47,900 --> 00:16:04,041
-In cancer patients very often before they die there is this uncontrolled cramping all over the body?

63
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:10,311
-Yes, yes you can relieve them, not save them but you can relieve them.

64
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:19,741
Of course Cuprum is one of the main remedies for epilepsy.

65
00:16:43,040 --> 00:17:10,241
The first signs are the clenching of the thumb. There is a tendency in the beginning to clench.

66
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:25,211
This positions is characteristic of convulsions. But in the beginning is the tendency.

67
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:36,201
The nervous system makes this thumb go inside and you see they walk like this.

68
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:51,961
Also this indicates a shyness, not being able to show your inner feelings.

69
00:17:53,840 --> 00:18:00,971
The Cuprum people are cramped and they cannot show their inner feelings.

70
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:49,691
They have a color which is like copper.

71
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:14,520
It's a peculiar color which is grey copper if you can imagine. You have to imagine.

72
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:39,611
Once you have seen it, you will not forget it.

73
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:51,521
Like earth but towards the copper.

74
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:15,641
There is some unhealthy, greyish, earth and copper put them together.

75
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:45,820
Also you get some involuntary grimaces (faces). Like Agaricus.

76
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:57,690
The grimaces in Cuprum are much more.

77
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:05,840
Agaricus is less. It's twitching.

78
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,760
You feel all the muscles in tension.

79
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:45,161
You will feel they try to hide something which they don't know themselves what it is.

80
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:59,051
These people they have psychoanalyzed themselves, they have done quite a lot to be able to release this pressure. Nothing.

81
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,130
I have seen the most disturbing

82
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:23,321
 for 5 minutes and then released. And then again after an hour. With the least emotions which are stimulated.

83
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:37,421
 These are not cramps, I don't know how to say it. When the cramps come are very painful.

84
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,571
Not always painful.

85
00:22:45,800 --> 00:23:00,911
When the cramps come on the extremities, very painful. These cramps here may not be painful but

86
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:14,401
you have a gastritis and you say, what do you feel? They feel cramping pain. Very clearly they will describe it.

87
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:27,111
-I have a question also. Is Cuprum a case on hyperventilation?

88
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:40,871
-Sure it can be in any case as long as you have the cramps or the cramping, the grimaces, the cramped emotions.

89
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:54,631
Because people will hold back. You know a syndrome which is called Tourette?

90
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,850
It's called Gilles de la Tourette.

91
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:52,961
This is a terrible and difficult for us to cure also. It belongs to the ticks. It's the worst from all the ticks with this kind of grimaces.

92
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:11,171
This syndrome comes also together with the need to speak out bad words.

93
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:53,521
 When you battle with such cases then you get some experience, you know what I mean.

94
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:19,251
-Should it be cramps always or it can be tensed?
-I want to say that always when I speak, I speak on an exaggerated level.

95
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:28,531
I speak to give you the clear picture. Before you reach that clear picture there are steps.

96
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:39,341
If you get the essence of the whole thing, then you can understand the steps. Because it's not possible for me

97
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:49,441
to describe all the different steps. So it is true that you don't need to have this, there is a tension,

98
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:55,920
 a tension which can bring stammering.

99
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,011
The speech is cramped.

100
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:29,991
In Stramonium where the subconscious is so much in aggravated state, the stammering is ....

101
00:27:39,090 --> 00:28:02,481
You look at the person and you say 'God! Just say one word'. There is aggression, suffering.

102
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:20,281
And it's different stammering as I said, Caust. stammering yes but if they are excited, then they cannot speak.

103
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:27,041
And then you get the Mercury stammering which is a sweet stammering.

104
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:21,441
-What is the difference with the cramps of Nux-v.?

105
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:39,181
-The pains of Nux-v. are not cramping pains; sometimes they are but the main pains in Nux-v. are burning.

106
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:46,861
Heartburns. It is burning and comes up there.

107
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:57,471
No in the legs we have Caust. and Calc.

108
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:19,931
I was saying that Merc. has a stammering that you hardly understand

109
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:35,401
you don't feel any pressure behind and therefore you are sympathetic towards that.

110
00:30:42,560 --> 00:31:00,160
You don't even mind but the other remedies like the Stramonium.... oh God!

111
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:10,550
Because it is a violent remedy the expressions are violent in Stramonium.

112
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:43,881
Very good remedy when you give final examinations. When you come in front of giving the final examinations

113
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:50,361
 you better take a little bit of Gels. because you'll be a little bit trembling.

114
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:55,520
What is he going to ask me? Shall I answer?

115
00:31:56,630 --> 00:32:13,421
 The idea of weakness and trembling together. Weakness in psychic, in the mind and in the body and trembling.

116
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:22,401
So somebody who is weak and trembling we call it, there is a word 'coward'.

117
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:33,960
In the Repertory it says coward.

118
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:41,581
If you open the Repertory you will see Lyc. and Gels., the two main remedies for cowardness

119
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:59,011
 but Gels. is totally different than Lyc.
Gels. is a person who is totally afraid.

120
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:11,001
What am I doing here myself, I cannot be Gels., it's impossible. Gels. to appear in front of people talking

121
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,750
 forget it!

122
00:33:12,829 --> 00:33:22,721
If she has to do it she has written everything down and she has to do it tomorrow, she will not sleep the whole night.

123
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:33,771
Next day she will be trembling. She may do it if she has to do it. Sometimes they do it but they swear to God

124
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:41,480
 I'll never do it again. So much is the ordeal in appearing for an examination.

125
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:53,991
That's why it's very good for the students who are going to give an examination to a Professor who is really like a shark.

126
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:58,771
You know there are some professors you think they want to swallow you.

127
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:07,660
Then you take Gels. and you appear.

128
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:15,491
 The mind becomes strong.

129
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:29,840
In a state of Gels., not only physically you
are trembling, you are trembling psychically.

130
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:35,481
You are really afraid of how they will judge me.

131
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:43,571
What they will say about me? It's very important what others will say about me.

132
00:34:52,820 --> 00:35:02,021
I remember one of the old cases. I was treating for duodenal ulcer. I was treating him for years.

133
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:17,251
He was an electrical engineer studied in Germany and he was Greek, suffering with duodenal ulcer.

134
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:19,770
And I gave different remedies.

135
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:30,801
And he was doing better and then back again and then I was exasperated.

136
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:38,931
One night his wife comes and says to me. 'You have to do something for my husband'. I said 'why?'

137
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:45,671
 'Because tomorrow he has to be in the school
of the children', they had their children.

138
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:56,961
And they had the parents meeting of the class. All the parents of this particular class they had to meet

139
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:03,141
and he had to say a few things to this meeting.

140
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:16,121
His wife says, 'it is impossible for him to go'. Huge man, educated, I couldn't believe it!

141
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:24,190
And then suddenly I said to myself, this is a Gels. case.

142
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:37,621
I gave him Gels. and since then, 20 years ago, I lost him as a patient. He never came back again. He is very good friend

143
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:45,120
and he supports Homeopathy, he goes to meetings, he discusses.

144
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:53,630
 The last time we had a meeting of the friends
 of Homeopathy, he was there, speaking up.

145
00:36:54,190 --> 00:37:00,761
 It is unbelievable, I treated him for 2 years, giving one remedy after another.

146
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:09,721
Calc. and Graph. and Lyc. and then back to Graph., back to this, to that, relapse, relapse, relapse.

147
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:23,961
And just this symptom which I had not taken in the initial report or the follow ups came up so clearly

148
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:32,401
and then I put things together. And I said, oh my God yes that is Gels. Take Gels. 10M, 50M.

149
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,671
 Finished the duodenal ulcer plus all the others.

150
00:37:49,210 --> 00:38:02,361
Also there are people who are weak people in their minds and the danger is when they are standing in front

151
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:10,651
of some height. They are confused in their mind, there is a kind of vertigo and confusion at the same time

152
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:19,760
and then the tendency to jump. The tendency to jump from a high place, almost like

153
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:30,681
Aur. or Arg-n. but they have their own specialty. The confusion, the weakness, the trembling.

154
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:42,161
 They look quite old, they look as if the organism has become old and weak and trembling.

155
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:47,751
 Sometimes you see this in the face of the person.

156
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:56,581
The face of a person who is 35 and looks 50. Who is 50 and looks 70.

157
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:14,761
I saw a case of anorexia nervosa, 35. She was looking 80. Anorexia nervosa is a terrible state.

158
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:31,961
So we have this remedy, we say ailments from anticipation. Anticipates to go to appear.

159
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:44,821
And then we have frequent urination, trembling, diarrhea, all kinds of upsets in the stomach.

160
00:39:52,830 --> 00:40:01,071
Another characteristic is severe headaches, maddening headache. They really feel they are going crazy

161
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:09,801
and then during the headache the eyelids feel so heavy that they cannot open them. Whatever is the condition.

162
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:28,041
 If you have somebody who has, even without headache, heavy eyelids and trembling of legs is one remedy: Gels.

163
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:36,721
Heaviness of they eyelids and sometimes because of the trembling, they arrive at paralysis stage

164
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:44,921
it's a remedy which will be indicated in the multiple sclerosis cases.

165
00:40:45,000 --> 00:41:04,431
Where we have weakness, trembling, paralysis and also if they have diplopia. Double vision.

166
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:15,161
Of course the multiple sclerosis many times starts with double vision.

167
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:25,341
But if you have the Gels. case you will have the double vision and then you will have the trembling

168
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:34,230
and then you will have the paralysis and then you will have the weakness and then you will have the drooping of the eyelids.

169
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,061
Almost the eyelids paralyze.

170
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:52,081
Therefore it will be a remedy that will be indicated also in another disease which is called myasthenia or myopathy.

171
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,771
Where we have drooping of lids.

172
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:32,801
Another characteristic which has to do with the heart is, the heart feels weak in general and sometimes

173
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:42,201
the impression is that their heart has stopped. And they have to move, to make some movement

174
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,021
to see that their heart is beating again.

175
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:53,361
The idea is the heart stops and they will describe it to you very clearly. They will say, 'I feel many times my heart stops.'

176
00:42:53,440 --> 00:43:04,501
'And what you have to do?', 'I have to jump up and move in order to make it start again'. That's characteristic.

177
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:32,780
Also chilliness, chills that go up and down the spine.

178
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:51,681
Also they have a feeling in the heart as if they expect to hear bad news.

179
00:43:53,640 --> 00:44:05,521
And if they hear really bad news or what they feel is bad news, they have a great reaction, much too greater

180
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:09,671
 in proportion to the information that came in.

181
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:17,370
'They are going to catch me. The police is coming'.

182
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:32,771
They imagine, they exaggerate the fear and the bad news have a big effect on them.

183
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:47,841
We say 'bad effect from hearing bad news'. The idea is this losing of heart, this is the idea behind.

184
00:44:51,340 --> 00:45:02,160
That's why in the Repertory says, big reactions from hearing bad news.
