1
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,830
I shall be talking to you this morning about Ranunculus bulbosus.

2
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:55,660
So Ranunculus bulbosus cases I would say they are touchy.

3
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:08,820
Touchy is somebody who is very easily offended, you tell something

4
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:23,670
and they are offended very much, so they are touchy, discontented and angry.

5
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:34,920
These persons are closed persons.

6
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:48,560
And they will give you the sense that they are weak and they are looking for help,

7
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,830
they will ask for help.

8
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:08,650
They will ask for help in a very respectful manner, you see it inside, Mr. Professor.

9
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,820
I remember a case that has been treated in the Center for chronic headache

10
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:25,060
and symptoms and all kind of things and he approached me in a very respected manner and

11
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:30,910
says Mr. Professor, we will not be able to see you for a while etc.

12
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:43,410
I gave him Sulphur, Dulcamara etc. but he was very faithful, he was coming

13
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:50,000
and then I treated him and I recognized the Ranunculus state.

14
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:08,170
Why this attitude? You combine now this touchiness, very easily offended,

15
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:20,600
discontented inside and a deep angriness with an outside appearance of please help me,

16
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:32,100
I know you are the greatest, great respect, please help me and underneath all that you recognize

17
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:38,090
a kind of anxiety which is going on concerning their health.

18
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:45,670
An anxiety which will never be admitted. They will not say I'm anxious about my health, no.

19
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:53,430
They feel that their ailments are so difficult and so peculiar

20
00:03:53,530 --> 00:04:06,760
that most probably something serious is going on and therefore it is very justified to seek help

21
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,360
and to seek the best possible help.

22
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:23,010
Bulbosus state brings about a state of weakness generally

23
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:34,250
that will not allow the individual to work, to do his usual work

24
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:42,010
or if the case is not very serious, it's a vital syndrome, it's not a serious condition,

25
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:49,350
they will keep on going to their work but they will avoid any kind of further responsibility.

26
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,450
They feel they are too sick to undertake.

27
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:04,350
They are discontented but they are not ambitious, they are not ambitious and in their job

28
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:10,840
if they offer them a promotion that requires more activities and responsibilities,

29
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:16,190
they will not take it. They will try to avoid.

30
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:21,760
I mean the natural thing is to say, yes thank you, I will take it.

31
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:29,110
Not the Ranunculus bulbosus because they feel inadequate.

32
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:35,680
This touchiness, this easily offended and this discontent and this angriness

33
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:44,760
which comes out from time to time under stress, great angriness you will see.

34
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:58,640
It' so proper this man, it's so typical, formal, how he behaves now in such manner?

35
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:15,510
And also censorious, critical, the anxiety will appear more like a hypochondriasis.

36
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:21,650
They will deal with matter again and again that are not important,

37
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,270
especially concerning their health.

38
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:41,030
Another element which is there is a sense of lack of self-confidence.

39
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:02,910
With the outside people very respectful, very formal, very proper, with the people

40
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:12,160
that are closed to them it seems that the emotions are kept and they are brought out suddenly

41
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,270
and they have sudden outburst of anger.

42
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:36,130
The touchiness will go through all element, mind, emotional and also physical.

43
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:42,630
Touching them, pressure aggravates them.

44
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:52,030
For instance they will wear something, they will press the abdomen, they will press here,

45
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:57,290
they will press a point and all this will aggravate.

46
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:01,380
So many times you may confuse that with Lachesis.

47
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:31,770
The proper contact that they have adapted is always towards, for instance, not to smoke,

48
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:40,020
not to drink alcohol, it's not proper but you see this is an intellectualization

49
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:52,780
that has come about them and alcohol makes them very bad. They feel all the ailments,

50
00:08:52,880 --> 00:09:02,350
especially the pain and more especially the headache aggravates tremendously by alcohol.

51
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:08,900
They are not alcohol drinkers out of properness but even most of the cases

52
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,360
if they do drink even a little, they have a big aggravation from alcohol.

53
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:22,960
So they don't like to be touched, affects them, alcohol affects them.

54
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:35,200
This proper sense goes through their sexual lives as well.

55
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:43,850
Usually are oversexed. But while they are oversexed,

56
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:52,960
they will not expressed their sexual feelings during their sexual act.

57
00:09:54,450 --> 00:10:04,610
They will just be very quiet, very proper, they will try even there to be proper,

58
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:11,540
in sexual contact. It is a silent sexual act.

59
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:26,430
Alcohol makes them feel intoxicated very easily.

60
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:32,200
Now even without alcohol Ranunculus bulbosus will have the feeling of intoxication.

61
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:39,690
So in cases when you have headaches, when you have cervical syndrome

62
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:55,450
where the cervical vertebrae are affected  and there is pressure in the vascular system

63
00:10:55,550 --> 00:11:06,610
and there is not very good oxygenation, the first symptom is dizziness

64
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:11,110
and the pressure here is stiffness around their neck and a dizziness

65
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:16,430
which eventually ends up into severe headaches, which are mostly on the right side

66
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:22,690
and mostly inside the eyes, which are aggravated by touch, aggravated by alcohol

67
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:27,800
and aggravated by cold and damp weather.

68
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:37,210
So you have this idea now, this man who is suffering with this cervical syndrome,

69
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:48,050
the dullness, the discontent, the suffering that he projects much more than he feels it maybe.

70
00:11:50,300 --> 00:12:00,550
And then the formal thing, Mr. Professor will you be able to do something about my case?

71
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:15,940
The inferiority complex has a peculiarity, they may talk about their inabilities but deep

72
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:21,270
down they will feel they are being better than others.

73
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:27,360
In private talking they will say, I'm doing much better the work than him

74
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:34,610
but if proposed a promotion, they will say no, I'm not good enough for promotion

75
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,110
and things like that.

76
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:40,450
But they are critical, that's why it says censorious.

77
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:57,350
I will just read you from the Repertory from the mind, it says abusing anger,

78
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:06,910
which comes when? When he is very much close to his family only.

79
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:16,280
And ailments from anger, anger is so strong sometimes that will leave a kind of depression,

80
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,920
malaise feeling and not feeling well.

81
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:28,190
Censorious, concentration difficult, has a vacant feeling on attending to think.

82
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:38,870
You see this lack of oxygenation and usually the pressure here brings a feeling of malaise,

83
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:43,460
you can not talk, complete discontent.

84
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:53,110
I remember a case in 1968 that he kept on coming, exactly that picture.

85
00:13:53,210 --> 00:14:05,110
He kept on coming for one and a half year, we prescribed... and nothing and I was desperate.

86
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:14,020
Then eventually the poor man left us when I recognized Ranunculus bulbosus

87
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,030
it was too late for him.

88
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:20,520
It was a case of Ranunculus bulbosus and I had prescribed Rhus tox,

89
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:27,950
Bryonia, Dulcamara, and he would say the exposal to cold,  the stiffness here,

90
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:35,200
the wet weather and then he was exactly that kind of person "would you please"

91
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:40,190
and he was coming one and a half, two years, I can't remember how long, without any offend,

92
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,200
we prescribed a remedy.

93
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,920
We finally went to the most sophisticated remedy, not Ranunculus bulbosus.

94
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:49,520
We did nothing, we lost him.

95
00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:09,410
Confusion of mind, coward, discontented, dullness, escape, exertion aggravates,

96
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,920
from mental exertion.

97
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,520
He can not take mental exertion.

98
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,410
If he tries, he says I'm too sick, I don't want to think, I don't want to make more

99
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:27,860
but they are fastidious, proper people, they are able to do things.

100
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,580
They are able to accomplish and they are superiors, they like them.

101
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:37,920
And they like to promote them, they will say, no. Mental exertion aggravates.

102
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:43,910
There is also a general aggravation in the evening.

103
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:47,760
A general aggravation in the evening is characteristic.

104
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:56,910
And he is forgetful, indolent, irritability we will see in Ranunculus bulbosus in capital,

105
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,760
especially in the evening.

106
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:13,260
And we see loathing at work, you see the effort at work.

107
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:20,410
You see the doctor comes and says, now you are good enough to work.

108
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:30,260
You don't understand, I feel very bad, I can not go to work. That is the attitude.

109
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:39,330
You see in the Repertory here and there but to synthesize and to say

110
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,930
this is the picture I'm giving you.

111
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:57,580
Offended easily, quarrelsome, also restlessness is a characteristic of Ranunculus bulbosus

112
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:08,580
that will make you feel that it is Rhus tox. You will confuse Ranunculus with Rhus tox

113
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:14,330
because the restlessness is there but Ranunculus bulbosus is worse from motion.

114
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:19,530
Motion will not help so much. He is restless and he wants to go up and down

115
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:23,420
but he will not be ameliorated by motion.

116
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:44,240
Dullness of senses, vanishing of senses, inclination to sit,

117
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:49,260
complains from thinking aggravates his situation.

118
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:12,140
And violent also. He has some anger sometimes, the anger sometimes is so much

119
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,410
that it appears violent anger.

120
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:38,720
Ranunculus bulbosus is a remedy that mostly will cover arthritic, rheumatic conditions

121
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,070
and skin condition.

122
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:55,210
But they have a sphere of action around the chest, the muscles of the chest

123
00:18:55,310 --> 00:19:02,220
are affected very much and also the bronchial and the lungs can be affected

124
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:08,960
with the typical left sided pain in Ranunculus bulbosus.

125
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:14,210
In Ranunculus therefore we will see the herpes zoster developing in the left side,

126
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:19,460
the intercostal neuralgias developing mostly on the left side

127
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:28,560
and the pneumonia developing on the left side.

128
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:58,170
Characteristic is a pain in a spot with circumscribed circle

129
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:02,180
upon the chest and the sternum.

130
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:25,680
Also it has pain on the inner side of the scapula while sitting and knitting.

131
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:37,810
With this inner motion, especially the women, they will have severe pain in the inner side

132
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:44,410
of the scapula that will make her very uncomfortable and they will have to give up...

133
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:53,300
I have seen this with Rush tox, with Kali bichromicum.

134
00:20:53,400 --> 00:21:00,910
Sometimes Kali Bichromicum, the best remedy is Ranunculus bulbosus and Pulsatilla.

135
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:21,560
What is interesting as a general element is the worse from cold,

136
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:29,410
they are very worse cold generally and especially walking to a cold weather.

137
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:36,560
They feel the cold penetrates them absolutely and especially the painful spots.

138
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:42,310
The painful spots are aggravated by cold, walking especially.

139
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:52,050
They feel some kind of pressure, as they walk against the cold

140
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:57,990
they feel aggravated very much in their painful spots.

141
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:10,390
If we have a case, a situation where we have worse in the evening,

142
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:15,140
worse from touch and worse from exposal to cold,

143
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,890
this tripod you have to think of Ranunculus bulbosus.

144
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:23,220
Worse evening, worse touch, worse exposure to cold,

145
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:28,830
most probably is a case of Ranunculus bulbosus.

146
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:46,970
Ailments from anger can bring about a kind of trembling, twitching

147
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:56,720
and sometimes you may have an epileptic who has fits of epilepsy after anger;

148
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:00,570
we will be thinking of Ranunculus bulb.

149
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,640
There is also an anxiety which comes concerning their future.

150
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:30,380
Anxiety about their future and the family, this comes in the proper element.

151
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:37,130
They want everything to be safe, therefore they have an anxiety about future,

152
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:46,130
their own work, their own family but they will not do anything really

153
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:50,980
that requires an effort to better a situation.

154
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:57,900
Physical or mental exertion aggravates them.

155
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:19,820
The anxiety is felt mostly in the chest and many times in the heart region.

156
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:33,310
Coldness in chest in spots and when he is breathing cold air makes it worse.

157
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:38,710
The pain that is on the muscular system of the chest

158
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:44,050
when breathing cold air makes it much worse.

159
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:49,160
Either the cold that comes and touches them from outside or the cold air

160
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:52,730
which they inhale makes worse the pain.

161
00:24:56,230 --> 00:25:03,610
And coldness in the sternum we have Ranunculus bulbosus capital, the only medicine.

162
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:17,600
I remember a case with Ranunculus that has been a distinguished spot in chest worse with cold air.

163
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:34,760
Inflammation on lungs and pleura with these type of pains, with the aggravation from cold air,

164
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,850
from inhale etc.

165
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:08,760
So motion aggravates like Bryonia but not to that extend, we do not have the motion aggravates

166
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:12,850
to that extend that we see it in Bryonia.

167
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:32,500
I think I gave you the basics of Ranunculus bulbosus with some little details

168
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:39,020
that you will be able to find in the Repertory.
