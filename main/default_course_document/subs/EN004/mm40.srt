1
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:41,229
As I said, you cannot really get away from studying Homeopathy. It's a subject which needs constant aplication

2
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:46,179
constant study. The knowledge is too much.

3
00:00:53,010 --> 00:01:01,259
The results are quite satisfying if you know what you are doing.

4
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:17,009
Until now I can tell you with my experience and seeing what others are doing, people did not know what they were doing.

5
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,999
They were giving homeopathic remedies but they did not know.

6
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,949
 Many times they would give a correct remedy and they would not know.

7
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:35,270
That is the biggest problem with Homeopathy today.

8
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:41,759
You give a remedy, it has acted and you don't realize how it has acted or why it has acted.

9
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:49,439
And you say, this remedy did nothing, take another one, take another, take another one and eventually

10
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,319
you spoil your own good prescription.

11
00:01:55,370 --> 00:02:04,319
I believe she has taken before Ignatia, she has mentioned Ignatia. We will see whether Ignatia will act now, yes or no.

12
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,849
How is that Ignatia will act now and did not act before?

13
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:12,109
You have to think about these things.

14
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:23,799
And that is what you are learning and I understand as I said, it's very difficult because the subtleties are very different.

15
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:33,869
For instance we'll talk about Lyss. today. Hydrophobinum or Lyss. is the same.

16
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:45,559
Hydrophobinum or Lyss. comes from the saliva of a dog who has rabies...

17
00:02:45,560 --> 00:03:00,799
 and as you will see there are symptoms in Lyss. which look like, which remedy?

18
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:17,839
Which look like Stram. and what are the similarities between the two remedies?

19
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:33,479
It's the fear of water and the effect of running water and in both remedies there is some fear.

20
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:48,959
Another similarity is the violent temper.

21
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:04,329
Actually in Lyss. there are even differences in these two similar symptoms.

22
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:22,889
In Lyss. the idea is that the sound of running water brings a state of inner excitement, in such a way

23
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:34,809
that the bladder is paralyzed.
And the person almost loses urine.

24
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:49,789
Therefore losing urine during hearing running water, it is an indication of Lyss.

25
00:04:49,790 --> 00:05:10,569
Lyss. also is an abusive remedy. The idea is not so much violence; Lyss. will not reach the point where it will hit...

26
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:23,979
or will kill like Stram. But Lyss. will be abusive with their words. They will attack with their words.

27
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:41,079
Lyss. will be similar in their contact with Lil-t. but Lyss. does not have the sense of Lili-t. which says

28
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:50,999
'I have done my duty, what I had to do and therefore you owe me, you have to obey'. No.

29
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,089
This remedy is more abusive, more authoritative.

30
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:08,589
Especially you get people who have money, who have some kind of authority and they will treat the subordinates

31
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:12,179
 in a very abusive manner.

32
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:36,729
Lyss. has fear of animals but it's not at all the intensity with which the fear of animals is with Stram.

33
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,824
Stram. is much more attacking, much more violent, physical violence.

34
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,979
This is verbal violence.

35
00:06:51,980 --> 00:07:01,120
I found also that Lyss. is a remedy
that you will need in claustrophobia.

36
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:09,559
Terrific claustrophobia.
They cannot go away from their house.

37
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,680
They feel comfortable only inside the apartment.

38
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:27,679
Going around the block is almost impossible for them...when they have this claustrophobia case.

39
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:59,439
Finding themselves in a traffic is impossible,
they will just leave the car and go away.

40
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:10,039
They are afraid that they cannot get away from the place where they have been.

41
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:30,599
Also it is very strange, she has a fear of water but Lyss. will do exactly the same like the patient yesterday with the bottle.

42
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:41,399
They have a bottle and they test whether they can swallow, they feel that they cannot swallow.

43
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:49,079
Therefore in order to be sure that they can swallow, they have a bottle of water

44
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:54,989
 which they take and take sips very frequently.

45
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:10,009
It is not thirst, it's only a sip to make sure that they can swallow. And many times they have difficulty in swallowing.

46
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:20,569
If you give them a little bit bigger pills, they will not take them. They say, 'forget it I will not take that'.

47
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:28,079
So I say, 'OK put some water'. 'Yes, this I can do'.

48
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:50,399
The disease is such that makes these individuals very demanding from others and if they don't get what they want...

49
00:09:50,400 --> 00:10:01,959
they suffer very much. 'You should
have done this for me!'. That attitude.

50
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:16,719
Tremendous anxiety on anticipation.
 They have to have an appointment.

51
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:27,619
By saying they cannot go outside of their house, I don't mean that all Lyss. cases cannot go out of their houses.

52
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:40,879
In the beginning stages or when they don't reach that severe claustrophobic state, they circulate, they go out.

53
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:55,419
 But the idea is my throat is tightening up enough and I cannot swallow. And I don't like to be in a room.

54
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:06,799
Lyss. will sit there, next to the door. If they will come here and they have that kind of anxiety, forget it.

55
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:16,299
But not every Lyss. will have this symptom.

56
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:25,579
So they have an appointment, the excitement is there. Can you imagine the nervous system of a person

57
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:39,199
who hears the water running and he feels almost paralyzed, there is an excitement inside and they have to rush to urinate.

58
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:54,119
Many times this picture or similar picture will come from people that have been treated with anti-rabies injections.

59
00:11:54,120 --> 00:12:08,869
I don't know the contemporary treatment what it is but the older treatment it was consisted of some severe type

60
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:13,839
of injections that they were doing in the abdomen.

61
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:25,319
And this treatment is terrible and leaves the individual invalid for the rest of his life.

62
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:32,849
Definitely it will have a side effect whether it will be very big or a smaller one, it doesn't matter but always when you see

63
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:41,919
 that in the history, expect at a certain point that Lyss. will be indicated.

64
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:55,329
Another thing which I have seen is that the voice changes. The patient will tell you, my voice has changed.

65
00:12:55,330 --> 00:13:01,839
There is quite an impressive difference in the tone of their voice.

66
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:20,639
They have a peculiarity also because you see this strong individual, aggressive, abusive, very abusive...

67
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:30,379
and when it comes to the point where they will see some suffering, they are paralyzed.

68
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:44,759
They become like Caust. or Phos. even in their desire to help somebody who is suffering.

69
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:51,760
They feel they are suffering, they are open.

70
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,514
Feeling the suffering of others means an openess on an emotional level, where the person feels has no protection

71
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:18,639
 against the idea of suffering of somebody.

72
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:25,919
This Phos. case is exemplifying this very strongly.

73
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:48,909
They suffer themselves, the Caust. also. They can faint. The Caust. is mostly on injustice, the Phos. is mostly on suffering.

74
00:14:48,910 --> 00:15:04,399
This remedy also has this peculiarity, abusive, strong, authoritative, hard to subordinates; yet he sees somebody...

75
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:13,959
 with fever, with pains, they are paralyzed. They say, 'I can't do anything; when I see this, I'm finished.'

76
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:30,639
In their sexual sphere are quite excitable individuals who will be satisfied with some kind of strange sex.

77
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:51,159
The nervous system is such that in order to be excited, they need to have some peculiar, sexual desires.

78
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:04,329
They can be bi-sexual, they may want kinky sex.

79
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:24,549
The Americans say it, I don't know if this is an expression but I have been educated in America on these matters.

80
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:37,890
They have explained to me all these details.

81
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,879
 Is it correct, you are from America?

82
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:49,480
-Yes.

83
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:01,560
-Americanized Cuban, is this correct kinky sex?

84
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:23,960
-Very good. My education was in Berkley.

85
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,409
What does it mean kinky sex?

86
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:36,850
-Very strange and unusual act.

87
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,800
This is what I've only heard, I have no personal knowledge.

88
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:19,490
The sexual activity in the States can be very erotic, it can include of sadomasochistic tendencies.

89
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:30,479
There is a more of a desire to achieve certain levels of excitement that go beyond ordinary intercourse

90
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:42,719
 and it often involves pain, abusive behavior toward the partner, humiliation, derogation and ways of feeling

91
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:56,719
a sense of superiority or inferiority. And it's made to elicit an emotional power play between partners, 1,2 or even more.

92
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:06,129
There are actually clubs or organizations in certain cities of the U.S. where they indulge these activities.

93
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,390
-Great progress.

94
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:35,999
This person, what do you think according to the information he gave, will be indulging in what kind of sex?

95
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,469
-Power.

96
00:19:53,470 --> 00:20:12,159
-The power, the sadistic because it's abusive, it's strong, it wants to inflict pain and all this goes with the description.

97
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:29,159
But usually in the consultation room we don't indulge into such information because information

98
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:39,009
from the sexual area is difficult to elicit really and to make the individual give you the information, unless you are in America.

99
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:54,009
Otherwise very difficult. With the Greeks, how is your sex? Normal. All men are normal. Italian also, all normal.

100
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:58,259
 I believe Israelis also are very normal.

101
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:12,699
So it's very difficult unless you understand the nature of the remedy. Stram. what kind of sex may have?

102
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:24,519
From the nature of the remedy you understand. The same you understand the nature of sex of Staph. or Ign. or Nat-m.

103
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:29,549
we've spoken about the sexual sphere of these remedies.

104
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:51,799
For Nat-m. we have said. It has a sexual life which is very inhibited?

105
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:07,039
You see Nat-m. is a very closed person. Therefore in sexual matters will behave also in a closed way

106
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:19,415
and the vagina will be dry, painful, no enjoyment and difficult reaching orgasm.

107
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:30,519
But because of the suppression on the emotional level, on the other hand when they come into contact with a relationship

108
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:36,369
 in which they feel comfortable, then they become over excited.

109
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:47,759
And then they become very, the Repertory
 says, shameless in bed.

110
00:22:48,440 --> 00:23:00,669
That means that they like to talk with
 words which are exciting words and if the excitement goes

111
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:09,899
beyond a certain point, that is the time where the individual comes with instincts and does this.

112
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:20,319
So the nature of sex is according to the nature of general pathology.

113
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:31,150
In this case definitely we have a sex, in the books we find...

114
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:43,119
'complains for abnormal sexual desire'.

115
00:23:49,520 --> 00:24:00,289
Another symptom which comes with this excitement of the nervous system, the nervous system is excited

116
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:05,709
then the senses become very acute.

117
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:21,309
And sometimes they can hear fantastically well, they are best for spies. You can be talking there and I can hear

118
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:34,449
what they say and the taste and the smell is very acute. And sometimes there is in the taste a change.

119
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:42,639
Because the taste is very acute, they may taste something differently than the ordinary.

120
00:24:47,460 --> 00:25:00,399
The taste in the night it can become quite bitter and then they have the need to spit.

121
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:12,140
Spiting is also an interesting function of Stram., of Bell.

122
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:20,999
And they have an indescribable anxiety.

123
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:28,419
Very strong anxiety like the Phos. anxiety.

124
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:37,799
You prescribe wrongly in those cases because you don't recognize them immediately...

125
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:42,119
 so you prescribe different other remedies.

126
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:51,359
The claustrophobia and the anxiety Lyc. and there is no this tension but you say it doesn't matter.

127
00:25:51,360 --> 00:26:03,599
And then the thirst is there in sips and then you think that's Ars., with the anxiety, with the fear. Nothing.

128
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:15,589
Then maybe the water is not so much, like Phos. wants a lot of water but still I will try Phos. because ...

129
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:20,839
there is that state of anxiety, that tension.

130
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:27,599
When you are there and they are affected in the nervous system, you have them in front of you and

131
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:33,079
 they are vibrating from energy and anxiety.

132
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:42,639
I remember one case, she was a very rich woman.

133
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:54,499
In order to come to my place, because she's asked me to go her place, I'm talking back in 1970

134
00:26:54,500 --> 00:27:07,260
and 'I said no, I don't go'. 'You have to come.
She cannot come.'  I said, 'I'm sorry she has to come'.

135
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:21,849
 She came in a Rolls Royce with two people and said, 'I've never done this before. Come so far from my house'.

136
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:31,959
So far it was about 4-5 km and I did not know
 the case and I prescribed wrongly of course.

137
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:45,319
Once wrongly, twice wrongly... after 2-3 months later they call me on the telephone.

138
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:56,939
She is in a terrible state, she has locked herself in a cupboard because she didn't want to commit suicide.

139
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:09,769
She reached a peak of tremendous anxiety, I was giving several remedies but nothing was happening...

140
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:17,279
apart from changing a little bit the symptoms but finally all the anxiety came up.

141
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:27,279
They had a gun in the house and I can't remember she locked the gun or she locked herself...

142
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:31,759
 something like that. Not to take the gun to kill herself.

143
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:47,609
She was like this for 20 years, she could not go out, she could not go to a function, she could not go anywhere.

144
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:58,919
But she would not take allopathic drugs because you know they have big pills, forget it I will not take this.

145
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:06,829
I will not swallow this because if I swallow this, then I'm dead because it will stuck there and finished.

146
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:21,359
I did not know Lyss. by that time and she called me one day and she said, 'I am chocking because

147
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:30,730
the tongue has swollen, closing all the air.

148
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:45,489
And they called me and I had to go to her house. I saw that terrible state, in that condition.

149
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:56,329
I looked at the tongue, the tongue was not swollen. The feeling was that the tongue was closing up the whole pipe.

150
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:04,559
During that time I gave a remedy you never heard, Cajuputum.

151
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:18,759
I gave her this remedy and next day she was calmer and she came back to normal state.

152
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:29,919
And it was by one symptom of Lyss., I can't remember now, she mentioned.

153
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:37,579
After this remedy the picture of Lyss. started to be more clear.

154
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:52,199
And if I remember well she mentioned losing of the urine while opening the tap.

155
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:13,449
I said 'Have you ever be bitten by a dog?' She says 'yes'. 'What age?', 'Six'. She was eating something

156
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:22,509
and a dog jumped to take it and bite her lips at the same time.

157
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:28,060
And immediately she had the injections.

158
00:31:28,061 --> 00:31:36,459
 A few years later she developed this symptomatology. Eventually the symptomatology became worse,

159
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:50,719
 worse and she was by that time I saw her, 45 or 50 and she suffered for years.

160
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:10,719
And then she was the first who subsidized my Greek book. I had written a little book "The New Medicine" she subsidized it.

161
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,629
 She gave the money to be published.

162
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:23,570
Hydrophobinum, high potency and the whole syndrome started going down slowly.

163
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:29,079
In one and a half year, she was almost normal.

164
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:37,159
She never needed another remedy because she had a strong constitution.

165
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:46,289
-There is a rubric 'sympathetic, felt the same pain as his brother' and Lyss. is the only remedy.

166
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:57,079
I heard about this rubric that the way came into existence was that two provers proved it and the one had

167
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:01,719
a particular pain and the other said, yes I have the same pain.

168
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:12,339
So it actually meant that they had the same physical symptoms but in the Repertory says sympathetic attitude.

169
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:15,069
Can you comment on that?

170
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:25,949
-What I have seen, as I said, is the abusiveness and at the same time the sensitivity towards the pain. But I cannot say.

171
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:34,419
This is a peculiar symptom and you write it but it's not my experience. Not everything which is written here

172
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:44,199
 is my experience but if it's a strange rubric, then I give it, maybe you may need it some time.

173
00:33:48,560 --> 00:34:06,289
-By many homeopaths Lyss. is described like a victim. For example Sankaran and others...

174
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:17,279
-Maybe you misread the paragraph, not possible. You misunderstood.

175
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:30,289
-They are feeling tormented all the time and this aggressive reaction is only a defence.

176
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:40,849
-I understand. If you take the words of the Repertory and you try to augment this without the knowledge...

177
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:47,439
 what is happening really is that they are very demanding.

178
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:58,829
So if they don't get what they want, they feel they're tormented. It's a different thing all together as a concept.

179
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:17,609
My husband has done this for me and that, that's why I have a young man now outside of the marriage.

180
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:42,329
They feel that they don't get treated as they should be. It is not the idea of the victim, the idea of the dog that attacks.

181
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:48,259
This is the main idea.

182
00:35:49,500 --> 00:36:01,559
How is that they become such whimpers when they see somebody suffering and you see very strange things?

183
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:15,099
This woman, they would give me the information, she was very abusive. She was also using the other people like this...

184
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:27,279
At the same time she would be very sensitive to some others that according to her they were suffering.

185
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,059
And she could not tolerate their suffering.

186
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:44,119
But definitely not the victim. You take this word and with imagination, you make it... he is tormented, he is the victim.

187
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:52,129
No, he is not the victim at all. The others are victims. I can assure you about that.

188
00:36:54,860 --> 00:37:00,389
-Is it anyway similar to Anac. that could be so violent and so sensitive?

189
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:10,520
-That's a good point to differentiate.

190
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:26,039
Anac. is also hard and rude but it's hard and rude when he is not seen.

191
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:35,119
In people or animals to which he has absolute control.

192
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:43,719
Who is the people who have absolute control? Only your children and your animals.

193
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:59,889
To the children and the animals, they can be very rude but this remedy, Lyss. is authoritative. It has self confidence.

194
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:14,649
The other one is without any self confidence. So the hardness or the rudeness or the desire to give pain

195
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:23,119
  in order to feel some feelings is when they know they can do it.

196
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:34,469
With Lyss. forget it. For instance it's the husband who will get whatever they think and will just...

197
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:43,559
tell the husband, tell the authorities... there is an abusive element.

198
00:38:49,100 --> 00:39:07,359
A rabid dog will attack anything, a lion, a bicycle, a car, whatever. It's more or less the same situation.

199
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:20,849
-Would you also think of Lyss. in cases of dogs or cats for example who have been vaccinated against rabies

200
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:26,609
 but do not show this fear of leaving the house or other symptoms you just mentioned?

201
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:41,839
-Why to give it to the cats or dogs unless they show signs of extreme attack, extreme violence?

202
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:52,929
After having been vaccinated, maybe you can try. It's not my experience but I would think of it in case the dog

203
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:58,350
 is very aggressive or has become very aggressive after vaccination.

204
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:06,679
Because the nature of some dogs is to be aggressive. But if after vaccination, then they are aggressive,

205
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:11,009
 then you try Stram. and you try Lyss.

206
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:33,549
-I'd like to know if it is claustrophobia or agoraphobia? Because you said he can't go out of the house.

207
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:40,549
-Agoraphobia and claustrophobia is both in Lyss.

208
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:51,729
And especially they will feel it here, agoraphobia which you feel that you are chocked.

209
00:40:53,390 --> 00:41:02,399
-I would be interested to know whether dogs which have been vaccinated against rabies, can transfer this on to people?

210
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:18,099
-It's not been recorded such an instant, I don't know, it has not been in my attention.

211
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:24,939
The woman who is coming this afternoon, you can ask this question.

212
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:36,400
-Would you give it to human being who had been bitten by a dog who has rabies?

213
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:49,689
-And the human being survived?
-Immediately after the bite instead of getting the injection.

214
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,710
-No, no.

215
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:06,779
First of all immediately after the bite you don't know whether the dog had... because the dog has to be killed

216
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:10,979
 and examined to see whether it had rabies.

217
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:26,239
So if you give it in any case, I don't know. It's a very virulent virus.

218
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:36,219
It's the same thing as if you give a dose of hydrocyanic acid.

219
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:41,719
Can you save this person by giving a homeopathic remedy? No.

220
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:48,719
Because the poison is too virulent and cannot be counteracted by the homeopathic remedy.

221
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,479
It's almost like poisoning of the blood.

222
00:42:53,480 --> 00:43:02,720
-It seems for me to be a little strange to see that a rabid dog will bite really but Lyss. patient  only has some

223
00:43:02,721 --> 00:43:10,949
virulence in words. Because you often see a similarity between real remedy in the nature and the patient

224
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:17,479
 but now it's different  it's not really biting, only barking I think.

225
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:22,159
-Only barking but very badly.

226
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:31,399
You can understand what happened to me. I was with a medical doctor and we were abused actually

227
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:39,520
 because before I found the remedy, several months elapsed. And she was not getting better.

228
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:50,439
 And every time she would say, 'well you have made me travel and go through this torment, coming here

229
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:55,109
and here I am the same as before'.

230
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:10,479
I said, 'oh god she is coming today.
 Please God show me the remedy'.

231
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:18,659
It is terrible and especially if you are Carb-an.

232
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:22,479
If you are Carb-an., because you don't have energy...

233
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:54,159
Carb-an. is one of the remedies that do not have stamina. And they have a basic weakness, their will power

234
00:44:54,160 --> 00:45:03,159
 has gone down their stamina has gone down, their mental power has gone down.

235
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:14,959
And what will happen with such case? They are like a nice old man.

236
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:29,959
That means you can do whatever you like with him. You can abuse and if you are a homeopath and you are

237
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:42,679
in a Carb-an. state that weak state, then she will telephone you and say, I want to see you. You are exhausted...

238
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:47,639
you are finished and you don't have any more energy and you say OK.

239
00:45:57,350 --> 00:46:06,559
This remedy takes a lot of the abuse of others and the will of others upon you.

240
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:20,759
Because of the definite weakness and there is a kind of a desire for this remedy to do his duty.

241
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:25,220
To do whatever he has to do, properly.

242
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:33,189
Then people can take advantage, especially if you are in a position of a doctor. They can take advantage

243
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:40,639
and they can say, 'I need to see you tonight'. And you have appointments up to 12 o'clock.

244
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:46,159
 You say can you come at 12.30? Yes I will come at 12.30, they don't ask you.

245
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:58,319
I have been several times in that condition where people will telephone while I'm eating, while I'm dreaming and I keep on talking.

246
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:02,369
I don't say I'm eating now, would you please...

247
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:22,559
For instance Lyss. will never ask you, even if she hears you are just chewing, it doesn't matter, they will say the problem.

248
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:33,119
And you are trying to swallow and to listen to this, it's terrible.

249
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:51,249
You see the pathology is such that you get all these poisons from the effects of the outside, which

250
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:54,509
the organism cannot process.

251
00:47:54,510 --> 00:48:04,559
The lymphatic system which processes the toxins is not working properly and that is why it will develop

252
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:12,519
so much malignancy in the lymphatic system, lymph nodes become enlarged.

253
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:29,399
And then you will have of course malignancy as an end stage on the lymphatic system.

254
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:47,199
Once these abcesses develop there is a terrible burning feeling, exhaustion, burning feeling, gland swollen

255
00:48:47,200 --> 00:49:00,759
  and you see the life is going away from that person. You can keep him alive for a period of time with Carb-an.

256
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:17,519
Carb-an. also is a hot or cold remedy?

257
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:21,760
It must be cold.

258
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:32,969
By the time they go to bed, then they become very chilly.

259
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:48,200
 They have to cover very much to warm up, why? Because they lie down and the organism stays immovable, there is no heat.

260
00:49:49,120 --> 00:50:00,359
 On the contrary there is coldness and it develops more and more and then they develop chills.

261
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:12,039
So they will say, I feel cold. In which condition? Especially when I lie in bed. It's the main remedy for that symptom

262
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:18,360
and it's a keynote, a symptom on which you can rely.

263
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:32,490
The weakness will be very much more if you lose blood.

264
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:43,069
Women losing the blood every month, during this period of menses they feel very weak.

265
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:55,740
In Carb-an. we don't have anxiety about health, we don't have fear of death and we have the pushing of the organism

266
00:50:55,741 --> 00:50:58,759
 towards the limit.

267
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:13,249
The individual does not have the trigger, the necessary mechanism that stops them from going further and further.

268
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:29,249
And there seems to be a lack in the will power. The individual thinks I don't have enough strength to say no...

269
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,999
to stop when I have to stop.

270
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:41,859
Diabetes, many times you have abcesses they don't close and if the individual is cold and especially

271
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:49,779
having chills when going to bed, then that is a case of Carb-an.

272
00:51:52,280 --> 00:52:10,199
Hodgkin's disease Carb-an., as long as the pains are burning with coldness, with lack of desire to live.

273
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:22,349
If I live or I die it's the same thing. That is unnatural. The individual must be afraid of death.

274
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:30,519
If you are not afraid of death in a case where you should, that is a symptom.

275
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:40,289
And if you are afraid of death without any reason, that is even worse symptom.

276
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:51,879
You will see some headaches. Feels as if blown into pieces. He has to sit up at night and hold it together.

277
00:52:53,440 --> 00:53:05,879
Also many times because they keep feelings inside, they don't shout.

278
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:19,439
The natural tendency will be for an organism who is so tired, when somebody is pressurized to say, leave me alone.

279
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,339
 Like Nux-v.

280
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:30,089
Nux-v. when they have reached their limits and somebody is demanding from them, they can explode...

281
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:41,679
the same with Sepia. This remedy, no. And therefore the stomach is of the main seat of disturbance...

282
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:54,159
  and cancer may develop, stomach cancer, lymphs are very easily swollen.

283
00:53:54,160 --> 00:54:11,859
You get a Carb-an. and he has submaxillary lymph nodes swollen for years, with this weakness pushing himself.

284
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:22,639
You do this, I do this, I do that,  and then the lymph nodes develop until...

285
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:27,479
you realize what is the remedy and you give
 it and then they can protect themselves.

286
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:30,320
They say no, I stop now.

287
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:44,409
-A Carb-v. which is not in an acute state how would be differentiate because both seem to be indicated in older people.

288
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:50,679
 Is it the fanning or lack of lymphatics been affected in Carb-v?

289
00:54:53,630 --> 00:55:11,240
- Carb-an. will not have that desire for fanning, I've not seen it where with Carbo-v. the desire to fan is very strong.

290
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:20,279
Both are white, both are bluish in their lips...

291
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:35,309
and Carbo-v. also has a very fine cold perspiration which we don't see it in Carb-an.

292
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:44,609
Carb-an. is deeper than Carbo-v. It's deeper and more destructive.

293
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:49,539
You will use it much more times in cancer than Carbo-v.

294
00:55:51,720 --> 00:56:02,839
-I have seen some cases of Carb-an. where the patients are very sympathetic towards their parents or their sisters.

295
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,679
 Is it right?

296
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:16,439
-Yes, that's correct. This is what I say, they sympathizing with the suffering of others. That's why they can be pushed

297
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:22,519
 the homeopath or the doctor to exert himself and to do.

298
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:35,519
And if it is the sister or somebody in the family that is even more strong.

299
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:53,239
Also they feel the circulation is not strong, the circulation is just supplying blood to the brain and they can be having

300
00:56:53,240 --> 00:57:03,719
 that symptom of fear that they may faint. Fear of fainting without fear of death.

301
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:12,439
For instance Lac-c. has fear of fainting
but then it becomes great fear of dying.

302
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:23,089
Carb-an. has fear of fainting but without fear of death.

303
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:32,709
It's almost a physical symptom.

304
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:46,999
-Two times I had a very interesting experience with Carb-an. in extreme situations.

305
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:55,959
The one time was a very severe heart attack and the person showed as if she was dying and she got Carb-an.

306
00:57:55,960 --> 00:58:04,319
a C30 and after 5 minutes she was very well.

307
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:08,489
-What were the symptoms?

308
00:58:08,490 --> 00:58:18,619
-She was very pale and she had cold sweat and her breath was very slow.

309
00:58:18,810 --> 00:58:32,519
The next time was in the beginning of my homeopathic study and it was a patient with very strong pain on his neck.

310
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:53,519
His orthopedic doctor always gave him pain killers intravenously.

311
00:58:55,640 --> 00:59:05,799
And I gave him the same medication and he developed an anaphylactic shock.

312
00:59:08,070 --> 00:59:11,440
And he looked as if he would die any minute.

313
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:20,959
And with Carb-an. recovered, that was very good.

314
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:32,599
-Well Carb-an. and Carbo-v. are both on the verge of fainting.

315
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:55,369
What I have seen is that the one is just fainting, the other one is understanding that I will not make it.

316
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:02,519
Carbo-v. does not have the time to understand.

317
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:15,999
Carb-an. more staying alive with the fear of fainting in that respect.

318
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:21,329
Also Carb-an. does not need that.

319
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:34,899
-He told the sympathy to sister and mother. It must be related to home sickness because the home sickness

320
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:42,359
 is very strong. And Geukens said he knows people where they have to leave their country for example

321
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:49,039
from Russia to Israel  and they died of cancer because they could not be away from home.

322
01:00:49,040 --> 01:01:05,569
That is true. I forgot to stress this point. It is a major aspect in the Carb-an. pathology, like Ph-ac.

323
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:14,239
In the chronic pathology, you get this tremendous urge to go back home, to the original home where they were born

324
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:21,999
where they were playing as children and if they have left the place, then they can develop very strongly

325
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,720
 this home sickness element.

326
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,190
Very good that you mentioned that because I'm in Carb-an. state...
