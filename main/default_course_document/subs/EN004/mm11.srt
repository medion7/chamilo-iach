1
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,447
Platina, we could say, what is the essence of Platina?

2
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:51,720
It 's a remedy which has an inflated ego.

3
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:18,077
Inflated ego which takes two turns, either this or that. Either mentally inflated, that means the patient shows

4
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:32,477
great arrogance, great pride great haughtiness, to the extend that it may become quite pathological

5
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:45,997
and then it can really become a severe mental case where the woman or the man feels it's the Great Napoleon

6
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,677
or the woman says I'm the Queen of England etc.

7
00:01:52,640 --> 00:02:09,427
So this is one side of the remedy and in such a case, you may not see the inflation of the enlargement of the sexual sphere.

8
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:23,744
If the sexual sphere takes this impact, then there is no proud, there is no haughtiness.

9
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:38,847
But the sexual sphere is exaggerated to the extend that we have what we call in medical parlance, nymphomania.

10
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:55,037
So in Platina either you will have the nymphomania without proud without haughtiness or if this is suppressed

11
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:10,677
especially if a woman, for instance, realizes in the young age that has too much energy in sexual sphere

12
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:21,107
and she does not like it and she wants to suppress it and close it and stop it then eventually

13
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:33,587
she may go into a kind of pride, "I am bigger than others, I am superior".

14
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:45,109
And this delusion may eventually reach the stage, where they feel bigger, bigger than they really are

15
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,677
bigger than others, others are small.

16
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,397
It's something that, of course, is difficult for us to understand

17
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:07,167
but for them as if they are sitting on a high place and looking down upon small people.

18
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:28,887
You see this exaggeration of the ego in Platina and the tremendous exaggeration of the sexual need, on the other hand.

19
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:40,727
-Can it stop in the middle between both?
-Yes it can.

20
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:54,557
So you will have some of these and some of that, but take the two polarities and you will understand

21
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,077
more or less where a patient stands.

22
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:26,487
Of course in Platina you will get the woman who has a lot of experience, sexual experience.

23
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:39,157
Because when Platina is acting on the sexual sphere, is uncontrollable. She cannot control it.

24
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:50,917
The reason why she cannot control it most probably is that she does not have a total orgasm.

25
00:05:50,960 --> 00:06:01,157
She does not have a total release, a total relaxation so she can feel satisfied. There are small orgasms

26
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,637
which do not stop, she wants more and more and more.

27
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:16,047
A Platina woman they may say that I can go with 20 men, one after another.

28
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:34,717
In a case which I had with cancer on the breast, with metastasis in the brain and in the bones, I suspected Platina in this case.

29
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:42,820
So I asked her how she was feeling sexually.

30
00:06:49,400 --> 00:07:01,487
She was in that terrible state with the bone eaten up, the joint was eaten up she was in pain, with brain metastasis.

31
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:08,840
 I thought most probably she cannot have a relationship. Most probably she masturbates;

32
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:14,357
so I asked her whether she was masturbating and how many times.

33
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,720
She said 40 times the day!

34
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:27,597
I see a lot of Platinas here, they are not surprised.

35
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:42,277
40 times the day, I mean she was not doing anything else.

36
00:07:46,480 --> 00:08:02,357
I was taking this case with Alexandra, the lady who taught the taking of a case, OK Platina 10M.

37
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:18,157
She took Platina. This was one of these cases that you don't believe that Homeopathy can do something.

38
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:29,757
Metastasis in 8 places in the brain and several places in the bones. With pain killers trying to keep down the pains.

39
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:42,757
She entered with crutches, she came on a wheel chair. It's very interesting because it's very instructive this case.

40
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:51,997
She had telephoned through a clinic in London that she wanted to see me. So somebody from the clinic telephoned

41
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:57,237
and I said, no forget it I cannot take such a case.

42
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:03,917
We can do nothing, metastasis in the brain already and in the bones, forget it.

43
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:15,927
She insisted and they telephoned again. They said please she is so insisting that you must see her. I said, no forget it.

44
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:27,597
They telephoned 3rd time, the woman was telephoning from London said, she will pay you 10.000 pounds for 1 visit.

45
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:34,097
I said, 1million pounds no way, forget it. I cannot do anything.

46
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:45,107
Then, one month passed, 20 days passed and somebody who is my friend, a Greek friend of mine  who supported

47
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:52,577
Homeopathy all alone he telephones, he says George please can you see a friend of a friend from London?

48
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:08,687
I did not connect. She had cancer, no other information. I said, OK tell her to come.

49
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:22,677
Then she comes and she tells me the story. I said, you are the one? I told you I cannot do anything for you.

50
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:31,957
She said, 'no you are going to cure me'. I said, 'please I cannot do anything'.

51
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:39,187
I tried to tell her to go away. I tried again and again to persuade her.

52
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:49,447
She said to me something very strange of course. She said, I know you are going to cure me. Why?

53
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:56,977
She said, because I have spoken with God twice. One time and she related the time and another time

54
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:03,237
I spoke with God and God told me that you go to George Vithoulkas.

55
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:14,237
I said, never mind God I tell you that there is no way, can you understand this? No.

56
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:23,007
And then we were forced to take the case and the case developed in such a way as to become Platina case.

57
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:36,167
And I asked the final question. I said, how many times do you masturbate. She said, 40! Thank you very much.

58
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:38,987
What is going to happen now?

59
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:53,007
Very interesting this woman was from Australia and she hated her mother and her mother hated her and cursed her.

60
00:11:54,330 --> 00:12:06,397
The mother cursed this woman that she dies. And this patient cursed her mother and such tremendous hatred

61
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:12,677
I've never seen in my life. As a result, the explosion of the cancer.

62
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:25,797
It is very interesting because her mother was very rich really but she did not have much money.

63
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:45,527
Yet, she was living on borrowed money in London on the idea that her mother will die and then she will get the inheritance

64
00:12:45,570 --> 00:13:00,200
 and she will pay them back. And she was moving on this high society of London. She knew Murdoch the paper man.

65
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:19,850
Because she said maybe you would like to write something, I know him. She made it all blown up.

66
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:30,477
And the man who telephoned actually is the man on the aristocracy in Athens, in London, in these circles.

67
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:42,317
And of course I did not connect all that together at the moment I was taking the case but I just saw some symptoms

68
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,637
 that led me to the idea of Platina, asked her about and confirmed that she was a Platina case

69
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:57,227
 because of so much need for reliease on the sexual level.

70
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:16,657
She had pain killers and was monitored by a hospital in London. So I said 'OK I can give you a remedy

71
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:25,127
but if you are taking all these medicines that you take for pain killers, the medicine is not going to act'.

72
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:35,157
She said, 'don't worry I leave the medicine'. I said, 'you cannot leave the medicine because you will scream from pain.

73
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:43,797
You have metastasis'. The bone pain in cancer is terrible, for those who know.

74
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:52,797
I said, 'you cannot leave it'. 'No, no I leave it'. I said, 'it's your responsibility. OK, take the remedy'.

75
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:58,120
She takes the remedy, stops the pain killers.

76
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:11,920
 She telephones after a week or something and says, 'I'm very well'. I said, 'you do not have pains?'. 'No'.

77
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:20,597
 She telephones after a month, 'no pains I'm very well'. 'No pains?'. 'No'. This is very strange.

78
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:29,617
 And then she telephoned one day after two months, very early in the morning, 4 o'clock in the morning.

79
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:41,507
I wake up and she was screaming. She said, 'I broke a bone'. 'How did you break a bone?'. 'I just moved and broke a bone'.

80
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:53,877
It was a terrific pain. I said, it's not possible. I know that people who have such pains think that they broke their rib

81
00:15:53,920 --> 00:16:03,037
 this is the impression. What to do now? Take a dose of 10M, Platina 10M. She takes Platina 10M.

82
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:18,387
She calls me tomorrow, 'I'm better. No pain'. Very strange. She throws the crutches after a few months

83
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:23,467
 she goes to the hospital and she performs in front of the doctors, she was dancing.

84
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:28,227
She said, you could nothing. Now I'm taking Homeopathy and she started dancing.

85
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,157
I said my God, they will kill me.

86
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:50,157
And then one day she telephones after 8-9 months, she says my eye is coming out.

87
00:16:52,590 --> 00:17:05,027
Because the tumor was pushing out the eye. I said, OK you take Platina 50M.

88
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,297
Platina 50M, the eye went back.

89
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:18,207
And then she called me with some tremendous pains in the abdomen and then I changed the remedy.

90
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:27,207
I gave another 2-3 remedies until she became quite well and she did not call me anymore.

91
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:40,457
A year or 2 years passed and I did not hear from her. Then I'm in London and I call the woman who had originally telephoned me.

92
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:50,437
I said, 'what happened with this case? It's a long time she has not phoned'. She said it's a very sad story.

93
00:17:50,480 --> 00:18:08,637
Her mother died but before dying her mother gave all her money to a foundation so nothing will be left for her daughter.

94
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:22,097
She received the news, mother died, no money left. But she was borrowing the money, thousands and thousands.

95
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:36,947
So what she did? She went into a restaurant, she ordered a very nice food, she took poison and committed suicide.

96
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:56,981
This story is very interesting because it shows apart from the intensity with which the sexual sphere was functioning

97
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:13,490
it shows also the grandeur. Underneath this story you can see the grandeur story. One visit 10.000 pounds.

98
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:31,217
 And then borrowed money; how she was performing; everybody was thinking she was having real money.

99
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:49,827
The hatred that was inside which I believe created all the problem, the conflict with the mother

100
00:19:49,870 --> 00:20:01,407
which had created the problem.I believe if her mother had taken Homeopathy, she would be still alive.

101
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:16,487
Platina 10M. I said OK, take 10M it doesn't matter, you are going to die after a month or two.

102
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:20,120
Whether you die under 10M or 50M.

103
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:34,667
I think I repeated a few times the 10M but the most incredible thing for me was that Platina stopped

104
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:40,960
entirely the pains the next day, immediately.

105
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:52,547
-Could I say that I just had a cancer patient with cancer spreading into the bones and brain and he was very old, about 70.

106
00:20:52,590 --> 00:21:02,057
And I gave him Aconite D6 because he was run down and it was starting with prostate and he did not have any pains

107
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:07,437
he should have been dead 5 months ago and he is still alive, he is still walking, he can still go to the toilet.

108
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:14,757
He has a stricture but he still can go to the toilet on himself. I mean that is really ridiculous.

109
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:26,207
-How old is he?
-73 maybe. And it's a disabled person but he can tell you when he has pain or not.

110
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:31,717
So he should have been dead at least half a year ago. And he is still alive.

111
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,957
-Was he taking any pain killers before?

112
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:43,187
-He had a lot of. I was the doctor who had to prescribe this person and I asked the persons who took care of him

113
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:49,447
 if I could give him this because I thought it might help. And it was very successful on this case.

114
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,697
-And he stopped the pain killers?

115
00:21:51,740 --> 00:22:00,167
-No but he had Novalgin every two months and I'm a doctor and tell you, usually you need this  much more.

116
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:09,047
Very often, every day 3 times 20 drops I would say, this is the average that you would have to give.

117
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:12,287
So this one didn't have to have this for long time.

118
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:15,277
-With Aconite 6X.
-Yes.

119
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:19,480
-3 times the day?
-No, just once the day.

120
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:33,197
He had no pain at all.

121
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:39,487
-How long?
- He should have been dead by Christmas already.

122
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:45,607
He himself said, I will not live until Christmas. And then we have 6 months later now.

123
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:52,157
-So you started the treatment in Christmas?
-In November I think.

124
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,157
-It was with metastasis?

125
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:02,997
-Yes it was already in the bones. Starting from the prostate.

126
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:13,469
-But with metastasis on the bone. Very interesting. Especially the fact with Aconite and very low potency.

127
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:23,557
Did he have a kind of a shock before on which you prescribed Aconite?

128
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:33,677
-He was a disabled person. I was treating him; I gave Aconite because he had so much fear of dying

129
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:38,477
and because he had a very strange relationship with the people around him.

130
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:47,477
He was in fear that he would not be able to go to visit his relatives in Christmas.

131
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:54,860
So I didn't have to change the remedy but all I knew I wouldn't have known what else to give him.

132
00:23:59,787 --> 00:24:08,387
-Very interesting. These are a few of the cases in which we have success. It does not mean that we can cure cancer.

133
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:12,627
I don't want to give you the impression that I can cure cancer.

134
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:32,280
This woman especially, forget it. Once cancer has metastazed. Forget the cure. Maybe you prolong a little bit the life.

135
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:50,197
-If you consider cancer with metastasis a kind of desperate balance that the organism reaches at that time

136
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:58,857
maybe the remedy has to stabilize this desperate balance and so it could not advance but what about the pain?

137
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:09,250
 Is it natural morphine? It is very mysterious. Anyway stabilize the desperate balance that was reached.

138
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:17,677
-Most probably, I don't the physiology. Most probably the inflammation on the areas of the bones

139
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:26,447
 where the pain is produced, the inflammation goes down. And at the same time the brain produces

140
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:33,677
more opiates to cover up the pain.

141
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:41,867
Maybe all together these are happening. I don't know the physiology. I cannot understand. I could not believe

142
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:48,057
that you take today Platina and the same day you don't have the pain.

143
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:53,127
I could not believe it myself. I'm just giving you the experience.

144
00:25:53,880 --> 00:26:08,317
But the Platina is really a remedy for cancer especially cancer on ovaries, uterus and prostate.

145
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:45,637
In Platina also we have a kind of hysteria. Hysterical reaction.

146
00:26:53,440 --> 00:27:12,037
That is why you will see that anger alternates with burst of laughing and ends in weeping.

147
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:30,647
It has tremendous fear of dying. Platina was one of the main remedies for fear of dying. The fear is overwhelming

148
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:40,277
and especially when the Platina produces certain symptoms.

149
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:52,517
Especially a numbness around the mouth, a numbness around the forehead that goes from forehead down.

150
00:27:52,560 --> 00:28:05,517
All these sensations bring on the idea that I'm going to get cancer and I'm going to die.

151
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:21,957
I have tried sometimes to treat such cases with anxiety remedies like Phos., Ars., Agar., Nit-ac, no effect.

152
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:31,637
And Platina calmed down this tremendous anxiety which is connected always with some kind of numbness.

153
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:41,517
They say, 'I have a numbness here' and they make such a big fuss. And I say 'OK, it's a little numbness don't take care'.

154
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:56,107
 'Oh no but I feel it'. 'Don't bother'. And then they telephone, 'Shall I take something to tranquilize myself?

155
00:28:56,150 --> 00:29:02,207
To calm down myself?'. Why? Because of that numbness, that numbness is still there.

156
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:10,187
I say, 'don't bother it's nothing'. Next day, 'shall I take Valium?'

157
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:20,960
And then you try to give different remedies, then you give Platina and things calm down.

158
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:31,887
It's very interesting also that Platina many times, especially with women, they dress in an impressive way.

159
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:52,157
A woman will come into your consulting room dressed meticulously with black glasses, painted beautiful

160
00:29:52,200 --> 00:30:02,197
wearing a robe, enters your room; she sits there and they have an air of exposure.

161
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:19,367
They are huge, something special, 'I'm destined for something which is special'. They have special mission.

162
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:32,087
They come from families which are aristocratic and all these can be delusions really. But in their mind, this is projected as such.

163
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:44,437
And there is another symptom which you will see with Platina, it's very interesting.

164
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:57,087
They are women who are practical, they are not romantic.

165
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:04,517
It's not romance which interests them; it is sexual urge.

166
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:17,037
And that sexual urge has to be satisfied. The sexual urge has to be satisfied.

167
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:27,640
So whether it is little girls, they will start masturbating at the age of 5- 6 years old.

168
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:41,077
And the woman also. They are practical. OK do it and go. They are not interested to have a romantic affair.

169
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,237
They are interested to release the sexual energy.

170
00:31:47,560 --> 00:32:00,747
Now given this fact, they do not have a good idea about the world. I mean, see the life of such a woman

171
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:09,647
going with a lot of men, some of them treating them badly, she treats them badly etc.

172
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:18,627
 Their ideas about the world is very bad and therefore as a result of this, they don't want to have children.

173
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:34,177
They say, no children, not for me, thank you very much. Children are no good for this world.

174
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:49,897
Yet, they have a dependency upon their husband many times and they're fixed upon their husband.

175
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:54,477
 If they go away, they feel my husband is not going to come back. He is going to be killed,

176
00:32:54,520 --> 00:33:04,917
he is going to have an accident, something is going to happen to him. The husband, they are fixed to the husband.

177
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:13,197
 It says here, fear something will happen to the husband and may not return home; may be killed or abandon her.

178
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:28,367
You see the connection with the other sex? It is very strong and she would be afraid, she would be terrified to lose this connection.

179
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:43,957
Anxiety, fear of being strangled or hanged. Anxiety about her salvation.

180
00:33:53,090 --> 00:34:04,357
If this symptom develops after a lot of experiences which are not satisfying experiences.

181
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:10,390
 You see to be in love and to have love is nice.
But Platina is not interested in that.

182
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:20,477
 Platina is interested, the man or the woman, they are interested on the sexual act, forget anything else.

183
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,240
-From your Platina wife...
-I don't have a Platina wife!

184
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,960
-Platina wife I wish I had.

185
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,245
-The potency?

186
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:50,967
- 10.000.
- Why?

187
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:56,067
-To shake her, high potency is powerful.

188
00:34:56,110 --> 00:35:04,837
-George could I just to ask one more thing about the Platina case because you said you used the 10M.

189
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:18,227
But last time you said if it's a very ill person, you should not give more than D6 or very small remedies.

190
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:19,957
So what made you give 10M?

191
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:28,147
-It made me give a high potency because the remedy appeared to be very clear. So I thought if the remedy is clear

192
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:32,720
maybe there is a possibility of a cure.

193
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:45,817
If the remedy is really clear, I can give high potency.

194
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:56,247
But we will talk about these cases. In cases which are severely ill and complicated, you will not get a clear picture.

195
00:35:56,290 --> 00:36:00,237
And it is better to go low and give repeatedly.

196
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:11,477
-I have given one lung cancer patient which was 75 years old, a very clear remedy also and I gave 1.000.

197
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:18,157
And she felt very good for 2 days and the third she died.

198
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,677
-Very good, she was going to die.

199
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:27,007
-I think she was. She knew it and she was very convinced she would but still this was too soon for me;

200
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:34,647
so I think I might have killed her and I think I did with this remedy. Could it be that I gave it too high?

201
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:38,797
-No, you did not give too high. You did very well.

202
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:49,917
 You see the problem is that everybody dies under allopathic treatment.

203
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:59,817
1million people every day they die under allopathic treatment on all the planet.

204
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:11,507
If one dies under homeopathic treatment, then we have a problem as if everybody is eternal, nobody is going to die.

205
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:48,547
-Can you imagine that you can aggravate a Platina constitution in a female patient?

206
00:37:50,910 --> 00:38:04,867
That you can aggravate it so much that she gets nymphomania from it? By applying Platina in the teeth or these things?

207
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:24,730
-With Platina can we aggravate the sexuality of a woman so she will be become nymphomaniac after Platina?

208
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:29,657
-In teeth?

209
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:50,067
-No, I don't believe it. If we can aggravate and make a patient nymphomaniac because as dentist we place Platina

210
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:54,957
 in the fillings of their teeth? My answer is no.

211
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,587
-If the person is sensitive?

212
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:24,647
-Well I would think that if a person is really Platina case and you do the fillings, if there is anything at all

213
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:27,317
 it's going to be a cure.

214
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:40,117
Actually I remember one case which has come for headaches and all that, she was doing very well.

215
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:48,231
The 6th month she said, 'I don't know what's happening'. I said 'what?'

216
00:39:48,820 --> 00:40:00,257
 She said, 'I do not enjoy sex so much. It has to do anything with the remedy?'. I said 'of course not'.

217
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:24,557
The children enjoy doing this and also the grown ups also enjoy having a lot of sex.

218
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:39,167
The problem is that all the organism is disturbed and they don't realize it. This is an outlet for the disturbance.

219
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:45,597
The same way an outlet for the disturbance for Tarentula is the restlessness.

220
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:54,557
She has the energy that becomes restless or Veratrum album the energy is spent in restlessness.

221
00:40:54,600 --> 00:41:02,657
-You said there are two kinds. One that the sexual desire was suppressed and then she became haughty.

222
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:08,477
Is it possible that one like this, that was suppressed and was haughty come for treatment

223
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:13,477
  for haughty and then her sex desire goes up and the other way around?

224
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:24,547
-What can happen is, for the time being. If you give the right remedy, the whole organism comes eventually to balance.

225
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:35,997
But for a period of time, when you say there is an aggravation period, maybe the sexual sphere is really activated

226
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:39,157
and then it comes back into balance.

227
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:54,800
- You said, if someone is suppressed and you give him Platina and then it starts acting out what does one do in those cases?

228
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,237
Cause I feel responsible, there is a nice married woman and I'm, you know.

229
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:19,607
-If you have a case and it's Platina and it starts having great desire for sex, if they are not married, there is no problem.

230
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:27,077
If they are married, they make their husband a little bit suffering.

231
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:42,347
And of course, they can resist. I mean under Platina it's not going to be something like madness

232
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:57,217
because this type of constant need for outlet, it is a kind of perversion.

233
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:10,377
And Platina is supposed to be the remedy for perversions. I don't know what kind of perversions;

234
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:21,107
for instance it has been a remedy for sodomy. But it is not sodomy, it is that the excitement is so great

235
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:30,517
 that they can do anything. The idea behind is not sodomy or not sodomy.

236
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:43,997
The excitement is so much that they can go on and do anything which can give them a release, a final release.

237
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:59,790
And the final release does not come. The final release that means the woman in order to have a satisfying orgasm

238
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:08,317
 she has to be relaxed, she has to be involved emotionally, she has to have conditions.

239
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:13,017
Now, Platina does not ask these conditions.

240
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:27,437
 The local stimulation is so much that she need only a stimulation on the clitoris. That's all, it's enough.

241
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:35,717
Of course not that she cannot be in love. She may be madly in love of course, you can understand.

242
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:43,335
Because a woman going from one man to another, sometimes she gets a man and says, that's it.

243
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:51,880
And then the man had it. Forget it, he will change countries !

244
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:11,897
I have seen cases where really the man could not tolerate and he had to leave because the passion becomes

245
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:20,127
so much and the attachment becomes so much the fixing is there, that the man had to leave.

246
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:26,057
-Can it ever be that she'll repress it again  and go back into a Platina state?

247
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:29,472
-Yes she can.
-How do you get them out of it?

248
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:44,837
-By Platina. A Platina can repress sex and become haughty and become megalomaniac.

249
00:45:47,800 --> 00:46:03,757
And then if this megalomaniac finds a partner on which she concentrates on sex, then she can be cured from megalomania.

250
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:15,447
By having a lot of sex. But in any case both are extremes and both are border lines in such cases.

251
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:21,097
-Can you say  that going from sex into haughty state is aggravation?

252
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:37,597
-It's aggravation. It's better to stay with the sex urge than going to the other state. It's border line.

253
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:55,997
A woman can still function in the society but of course it will come depression. Because sex, sex, sex is not 24h.

254
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:03,720
Sex is for a few minutes and then depression. And then fear, and then anxiety.

255
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:10,657
 It's an organism which is upside down.

256
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:15,177
-I was interested if you saw a Platina man?

257
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:33,077
-Yes, you see Platina men and it is the same thing. A lot of sexual urge with a lot of masturbation.

258
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:41,017
A man will have sex and then his wife or his girlfriend turns around and sleeps.

259
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:46,837
Then he goes to masturbate to be able to release the energy.

260
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:57,117
It's a lot of energy which goes to this area and cannot be released really.

261
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:12,157
You will see egotistical, if you see in the Repertory, you see Platina is there. Of course one of the main remedies.

262
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:29,717
It's the ego, I must get satisfaction, I am so big, I am, I need satisfaction. Me, me, me !

263
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:37,487
I am beautiful, I am this and that. These ideas are there.

264
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:45,757
-Are some features that Platina and Lachesis I think have in common according to your description.

265
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:53,777
Can you tell us something about the most important distinctions between those two?

266
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:20,767
- Some similarities are when they are thinking about next world and salvation. Shall I be saved?

267
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:29,750
The egotism on Lachesis is different.

268
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:42,277
 It's an appearance to the others,
 Platina is what she thinks about herself.

269
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:53,257
Lachesis appears to others egotistical because talks a lot, it's very extrovert, it appears to be.

270
00:49:53,300 --> 00:50:06,097
Platina thinks I am a special person. This is a difference. Lachesis does not have that feeling.

271
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:19,997
But about salvation, what is going to happen in the other world Platina and Lachesis have the same problem there.

272
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:27,887
-How about the need to have sexual contact to get their energy away?

273
00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:41,347
-The need is not comparable. It's much less for Lachesis. Lachesis also cannot go so easily changing partners.

274
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:54,037
Lachesis will find somebody and that's it. It will be very passionate but it will be with one person.

275
00:50:54,080 --> 00:51:04,367
In Platina it will happen once in her lifetime after she has been with 100-200 people, she may get one

276
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:12,367
whom she likes very much and then she gets this attachment. Lachesis is always attached.

277
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:33,557
-I was wondering if the arrogance and the sexual desire if they are correlated with the fear of death

278
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:38,557
in terms of do they occur at the same time or is there some type of progression?

279
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:55,797
-Fear of death and anxiety will come rather to the cases of sexual intensity.

280
00:51:56,350 --> 00:52:00,037
-Not the suppression?
-Not the suppression.

281
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:06,167
In the suppressed state where she feels all these delusions, she may run into delusions, then

282
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:09,647
the fear of death is of secondary importance.

283
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:13,057
-And will that alternate?

284
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:23,807
-Alternating stages are also there when she will have physical symptoms and then she will get mental symptoms.

285
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:28,077
And the mental symptoms go away and physical symptoms are appearing.

286
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:42,757
We have this alternating state. I tried to give you general lines of thinking.

287
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:53,757
You see Phosphorus, you get the main issues. Phosphoric acid, you get the main issues.

288
00:52:54,810 --> 00:53:07,667
Platina, what are the main issues, you will see this enlargement. Maybe the enlargement of the ovaries also is there.

289
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:32,270
With Plumbum you will get this idea of the people who like good life but they get the trembling, the arteriosclerosis, the sluggishness.

290
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:05,917
-Could you say something about Lycopodium and Platina? Because Lycopodium also can be arrogant.

291
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:18,607
-It's interesting what you say because Lycopodium has this tendency to change partners

292
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:23,827
and to have superficial sex, we call it.

293
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:40,087
Lycopodium is interested to have sex but it is not a powerful sexually remedy.

294
00:54:41,490 --> 00:55:02,097
Lycopodium it is from normal to less sex, to impotence. Lycopodium is the remedy that goes and have affairs

295
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:10,077
 but soon becomes impotent because of lack of interest.

296
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:17,607
So Lycopodium will lose interest, will find another one, will lose interest, will find another partner etc.

297
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:24,757
And by the age of 35 they are impotent, by the age of 40, impotent.

298
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:35,277
Because they have affairs which they did not involve, like Platina, the emotional side.

299
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:50,930
Lycopodium is not so much haughty as it is dictatorial.

300
00:55:50,973 --> 00:55:59,237
 In the environment in the house act like little dictators.

301
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:14,017
Outside where they don't feel so secure they become very subdued and obedient.

302
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:45,507
But it is interesting that Lycopodium wants to show off. It's like an inflated with air, ego with air.

303
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:52,737
That means somebody who does not really have substance. Somebody who wants to show off.

304
00:56:54,290 --> 00:57:00,477
Lycopodium comes and you have a nice secretary. You don't have an affair with her.

305
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:12,437
He comes and because she is good looking immediately he tries to make a date with her.

306
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:20,447
Then your secretary tells you and you say thank you for the information.

307
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:34,837
Lycopodium will show off, this is its tendency to show off.

308
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:48,477
I am a great man, I can have any girl  I like. They are easy in contact, not Platina. Platina is hard.

309
00:58:09,710 --> 00:58:17,477
You know that with the exhaust gases and all that we inhale a lot of Plumbum?

310
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:28,777
We inhale a lot of Plumbum which can be detected in the organism actually.

311
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:49,967
And Plumbum is a remedy par excellence of arteriosclerotic people, arteriosclerosis which comes after good life.

312
00:58:52,400 --> 00:59:00,077
Somebody has good living, enjoying, enjoy life.

313
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:19,997
That means having very good food, fatty food. It means having sauces, sausages whatever, having all these pleasures of life

314
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:30,367
 with eating, without any discretion and then arteriosclerosis develops.

315
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:43,637
And then we have the effect on the arteries mostly where they get hardened and the effect on the tendons Dupuytren.

316
00:59:43,680 --> 01:00:01,607
You know this syndrome, where tendons are sclerosed? These are typical conditions with Plumbum.

317
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:10,757
Plumbum is a very difficult remedy to detect because people will not give you much information.

318
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:14,127
 It's a very tricky remedy.

319
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:24,830
They will accept for instance that their mind does not work as fast as it's used to be.

320
01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:35,777
And they will accept also that the memory is becoming weaker and weaker.

321
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:49,067
And especially they forget words they forget recent things which are happening.

322
01:00:54,850 --> 01:00:58,350
High livers!

323
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:20,837
 Of course when it says apathetic these are end stages of arteriosclerosis where you see one of the main problems

324
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:33,757
is the trembling. Trembling from arteriosclerosis, this remedy is one of the main remedies.

325
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:50,120
I remember a dentist who started with this trembling and he said

326
01:01:50,163 --> 01:01:56,670
I have to resign because once the hand is not steady, forget it.

327
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:11,567
 But it is very difficult because I remember in 1976 when he came in Athens and Paschero

328
01:02:11,610 --> 01:02:22,937
was there and Ortega was there and Chand from India. And we saw a few cases together and each one decided

329
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:33,837
 on the remedy. So when we saw this case, the other three decided that it was Lycopodium case.

330
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:47,337
Why? Because Paschero said or Ortega, I can't remember and the other two agreed.

331
01:02:49,790 --> 01:02:57,537
And I said, no I don't agree but you take Lycopodium first. He took Lycopodium, he waited for 3 months, no effect.

332
01:02:57,580 --> 01:03:03,450
Then he took Plumbum.

333
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:21,117
 During the congress I was observing how he behaved. And by observing him I recognized that he was trembling

334
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:34,677
and I saw him, he was trying to seduce several women. He tried one, he tried another.

335
01:03:35,870 --> 01:03:47,460
 You know the man who has this tendency.

336
01:03:48,003 --> 01:03:58,517
Dancing with one woman and dancing with another, excited.

337
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:15,037
And then I said to him, 'open your hand'. This finger could not be straighten, it was like this.

338
01:04:17,710 --> 01:04:25,897
I didn't say anything to the others. OK you take the case, we all take the case.

339
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:48,357
And of course the observation is necessary. Really a homeopath has to be very cool observer, very cool observer.

340
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:58,197
Not passionate. Because if you don't like somebody, forget it. If you like, forget it.

341
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:05,197
If you like very much somebody, you cannot observe. If you don't like somebody, you cannot observe.

342
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:13,447
You have to be neutral always in observation to see really what is happening there.

343
01:05:13,490 --> 01:05:21,047
Homeopaths have to develop that quality of neutral observation.

344
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:33,397
You see the sadness, you see immediately the anger. But you don't say, 'you are angry'.

345
01:05:34,850 --> 01:05:50,237
 If you want to ask, you ask in a nice manner. But still you need to be very precise.

346
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:09,477
For instance nobody can understand anything about your characters while you are sitting there.

347
01:06:11,290 --> 01:06:21,437
Because you are calm, you don't show your qualities. But once you are in a social environment

348
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:28,247
 where feelings can be expressed, then the real character starts to come out.

349
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:40,087
And that is the time where others, people around, will give you information about a situation which you don't know.

350
01:06:42,110 --> 01:06:56,917
I have seen serious people sitting there, very serious, high judge. And you ask about his behavior

351
01:06:58,220 --> 01:07:02,467
and then you find out that he is quite naughty.

352
01:07:02,510 --> 01:07:09,977
You understand naughty? There is a German word or no German is naughty?

353
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:29,157
And you go totally wrong in your observation, in your decision if you make a decision while somebody

354
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:32,717
 is sitting there and tells you what he wants to tell you.

355
01:07:33,530 --> 01:07:49,057
And of course, these arteriosclerotic people they get eventually trembling and suspicious that others may want to poison them.

356
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:59,397
It's also a peculiar symptom, if you get the keynote, which is very strong for Plumbum, a sense

357
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:10,757
as if there is a string which pulls this to the back. It pulls the stomach to the back.

358
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:20,200
 A pain as if the stomach is pulled back by a string.

359
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:27,677
The idea of retraction.

360
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:47,317
It may mean this,  that when he knows that if he eats fat things, this will make himself harm.

361
01:08:48,640 --> 01:09:03,087
He is arteriosclerotic. You have to eat a good diet. They cannot. Their will power is not strong. They have used in nice living.

362
01:09:07,070 --> 01:09:17,977
It's very strange that you enjoy life and you live less.

363
01:09:27,450 --> 01:09:40,377
Also this is one of the remedies that has severe constipation, similar to Nux-v, with a sheep dung stool.

364
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:42,190
Stool with little balls.

365
01:09:42,530 --> 01:09:53,937
 Also it may happen sometimes that they will feel better in their trembling with alcohol.

366
01:09:54,990 --> 01:09:59,187
They drink alcohol and they can be more steady.

367
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:12,967
-So you can use this in alcoholics? Because if they don't drink, they are trembling and if they drink, they are better.

368
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:20,287
-Yes you can use it but for alcoholics this is pathognomonic symptom.

369
01:10:21,570 --> 01:10:30,277
I don't mean alcoholic people. I mean in people who don't drink or they drink usual, not alcoholics.

370
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:46,417
Most probably the alcohol promotes the circulation and these people are arteriosclerosed. The circulation is not good

371
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:51,997
alcohol promotes a little bit the circulation for the time being and then they become more steady.

372
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:08,310
They are people who are not fat people, they burn material. They are not obese.

373
01:11:08,353 --> 01:11:21,397
They are rather thin and a color which shows good living.

374
01:11:22,970 --> 01:11:25,120
Who has this color?

375
01:11:34,810 --> 01:11:46,757
The skin has some texture which is thick and juicy.

376
01:11:56,160 --> 01:12:00,757
-The President of Germany.
-No, no.

377
01:12:06,310 --> 01:12:24,067
Anyhow the color is not white. It becomes chocolate like as if they are sun burnt or maybe the sun burns the color.

378
01:12:24,110 --> 01:12:33,357
It's a specific type. I cannot describe it to you. If we have a case of Plumbum I will show you.

379
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:38,360
Is anybody Plumbum here?

380
01:12:51,670 --> 01:13:00,097
-George I want to know if it's so common remedy because in the country, where there is a lot of hunting

381
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:08,597
 the bullet from the gun will stay in the soil.

382
01:13:09,650 --> 01:13:16,597
You get the lead by the vegetables and things like that, eventually you get lead poisoning.

383
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:19,357
Can you treat lead poisoning with that?

384
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:32,717
-Yes, you can treat of course but the problem is that all the population because of the pollution, we get a lot of lead

385
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:40,990
 and we're going to use more and more. But the action of this remedy is very insidious and very slow.

386
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:47,497
That means you may recognize a case of Plumbum after you treated for 5 years.

387
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:56,600
You don't recognize and then it starts trembling and then your mind will go there to Plumbum.

388
01:13:59,020 --> 01:14:02,067
-The remedy also acts very slow?

389
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:07,427
-Not very slow.

390
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:23,917
The interesting thing is Dupuytren's which nothing can fix this, Plumbum can really fix the tendons.

391
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:40,730
-Is typical keynote?
-Yes, you can say it's a keynote.
