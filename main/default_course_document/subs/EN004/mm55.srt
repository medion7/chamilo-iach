1
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:45,079
Cancerinum or Carcinosin whatever you like to call it, it's the same.

2
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,080
When do you prescribe Carc.?

3
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:03,869
Even 20-30 years ago when I was practicing, I would seldom give or think about Carc.

4
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:14,709
Today we have to think much more frequently about that remedy and not always as the main remedy.

5
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:26,979
Many times as an intermediate remedy As I have mentioned for level 3 and 4 where we use a series of remedies

6
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:35,739
Carc. and Med. are coming quite frequently in the process.

7
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:43,489
Especially when you are stuck with a case you may be thinking of Carc.

8
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:52,939
You like to have some indications when Carc.  is really indicated.

9
00:01:53,690 --> 00:02:05,420
I'm trying to give you first the original picture, the constitutional picture of Carc.

10
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,839
Which you may recognize especially in children.

11
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:23,869
More especially children with asthma or children who repeatedly have colds and acutes.

12
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:29,599
Also children who are suffering with hay fever.

13
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:48,879
The type of the child that you will see in such a case is a child which the parents will say, what a nice child.

14
00:02:49,600 --> 00:03:05,799
She is very obedient, she is very considered. She is very good in her class. I don't have to press her to study.

15
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,359
She is duty bound.

16
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:24,119
Immediately you get the idea of Staph. You think that this child is suppressed by the parents.

17
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:38,109
I found out this is not the case. The child by himself, by his pathology I would say, they want to please others.

18
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:50,839
They are so sensitive to the reprimands, if somebody will make a bad remark about them.

19
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:58,279
They avoid at all cost this kind of hurt.

20
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:09,640
I'm talking too fast and I see computers are getting fire and there are some others who just enjoy.

21
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:28,479
Therefore I would say the basic idea is extreme vulnerability.

22
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:44,760
The child is very vulnerable, it's like the pains  which they come in the end stages of cancer, when you have cancer

23
00:04:44,761 --> 00:04:50,999
in the bones where the pain is excruciating.

24
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:03,809
If you have seen such cases, you will feel a pity because they shout, they scream, they feel the bones are broken.

25
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:22,009
In such cases of course Carc. will not be indicated. I have never given it in such a case.

26
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:26,719
I don't think it will do anything in these conditions.

27
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:42,549
What Carc.  will be indicated very frequently is when you have an extreme hereditary tendency.

28
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:49,759
The mother had cancer, the father had cancer, the uncles have cancer. In these cases where you see

29
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:55,119
the hereditary cancer is running through
 the family, it's almost a must.

30
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:05,719
There is a time where you have to use Carc. Maybe not as the first remedy sometimes as a first but definitely

31
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:11,219
 it's going to be a point where you will use Carc.

32
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:30,979
It's very interesting also, I have thought of Carc.   cancer is an aggressive, expansive, destructive disease.

33
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:38,719
From the point of view of the signatures if somebody was proving Carc. with his imagination will say

34
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:45,383
 expansive, destructive and these ideas of cancer. We see exactly the opposite here.

35
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:53,910
Constructive people, children who are not destructive.

36
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:05,259
You know all the children are knotty, these Carc. children are never naughty. They are never doing something wrong

37
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:15,089
 to displease the parents. The parents always almost invariably, will say 'such a nice child!'.

38
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:19,420
It might be a child of 18,19,20.

39
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,619
 This is in 99% of the cases.

40
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:35,129
Now, very seldom you will meet
another type and I have mentioned it.

41
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:56,569
Another type which is a fat, insensitive and self-centered individual, who will be like a bulldozer.

42
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:10,599
Whatever is in front, he will eat, he will grab, he will steal from his mother, from his father, as long as

43
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,320
he can satisfy his own needs.

44
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:24,110
That child also it may meet but it is 1%.
99% is the opposite type.

45
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:35,819
Actually in the literature which I have read concerning Carc.   I have seen only one such case.

46
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:45,569
And in my experience I have two such cases.
 All together they are 3 cases but we have to mention this type

47
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:51,519
as well because of the possibility.

48
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:07,039
As you may understand also these children are so sensitive, they don't like atrocities. They don't like to hear

49
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:14,359
that somebody was hurt, that somebody
 had an accident, his arm was cut off.

50
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:26,940
In this respect it will remind you of another remedy which is ... Calc.

51
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:39,289
Phos. can hear about such things, no problem hearing about such things, but when he sees these things

52
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:48,519
when in front of him he will see something
he will be the first one to run and try to help.

53
00:09:50,840 --> 00:10:12,119
It is somebody who is concerned about the pain of others. Here we have the vulnerability, the feeling of pain

54
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:24,359
from hearing stories like accidents,
atrocities with human beings etc.

55
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:36,689
A case of a man whose main symptom, there was only one symptom but made him impossible to work

56
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:46,060
impossible to function. He was invalid
 to understand the fear of humiliation.

57
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:59,069
There was such fear of humiliation which reminds you again in such case Nat-m. usually is given.

58
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:08,569
Because you see fear of humiliation, Nat-m. is very strong. But in this case it is something beyond this.

59
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:14,120
It is much bigger, much deeper.

60
00:11:14,121 --> 00:11:24,889
They cannot tolerate the least hint about something bad with them.

61
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:39,049
These children are lovable children and also they give love themselves to the parents. They also need affection.

62
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:46,559
They are the children who the parents know
they have to say a good word for them.

63
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:55,989
If they don't say it, the child still craves it but will not come out and ask.

64
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:12,119
Like Puls. will ask for affection. He will say to his mother 'hold me' or the wife will say to the husband 'hold me'.

65
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:18,300
She will ask for this affection. Puls. they need it as a physical need.

66
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:29,759
You hold her even if you do it without feelings, still it's OK. Puls. feels good. It's the idea of consolation.

67
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,339
They need this affection.

68
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:45,159
These children need it but they are proud at the same time. 'I do my duty, I do everything correct, so I expect that

69
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:56,189
 you give me affection, you give me love,
 not that I will ask you'. It's different.

70
00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:06,559
So you see this remedy how it goes between Staph. between Calc., Nat-m., Puls.

71
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:15,499
Yet they don't fit to any of these pictures
 really. They have a picture of their own.

72
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:24,479
Such children, as you may understand, if they are not shown the affection they expect

73
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:34,739
 easily they feel 'I must have done something wrong' and a guilt feeling starts developing.

74
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:52,579
And from the fact that they will not talk you get the impression that they will suppress their feelings

75
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:59,059
they will hold back their feelings.

76
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:21,999
It's not actually a suppression because we don't see with these people the outburst of anger which we see with Staph.

77
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:39,489
Staph. will hold, hold, hold back but one time she will have such an outburst, she will start throwing things, swearing, telling things.

78
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:51,879
Sometimes we say that Staph.
 could go into acute insanity episodes.

79
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:57,639
 They become totally crazy
once this anger overtakes them.

80
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:03,129
They can become for a period of time totally insane.

81
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:18,529
In such cases the remedy can stop an insanity crisis from tonight by tomorrow. Tonight you give the Staph.

82
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:23,049
and tomorrow  they have come back to themselves.

83
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:32,629
If you don't give Staph.  they will find themselves to the mental clinic.

84
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:43,869
And once they start putting chemicals and things like that, then this episode may drag for months before they realize

85
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,930
that the person is back.

86
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:58,108
This kind of cases like Verat., Tarent. cases these cases that Kent had seen  he made that statement

87
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:20,879
 for those who know, which is a little bit too much.

88
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:27,759
He said, if they let me go the insane asylums, I will take most of them out. This is not true.

89
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:34,129
Never mind whether you are Kent or whoever you are, it is not true.

90
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:41,809
What it is true is that the acute insanity
can be cut short by the correct remedy.

91
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:57,759
But the schizophrenia, hebephrenia, the that which starts as a basic disease at the age of 16,17 around that time

92
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:11,700
 and then continues with hallucinations and delusions and then you get such cases at the age of 30

93
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:23,759
after 20 years or 35 or 40, forget it. It's very few cases that you may manage to bring back into sanity.

94
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,619
-At the age of 23?

95
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:44,169
-If immediately with the starting of the situation, you see the picture, this is Tarent., you may stop it.

96
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,079
-Even after some years?

97
00:17:50,100 --> 00:18:04,929
-Once the years go by, schizophrenia is like a disease that destroys areas of the brain slowly, more and more

98
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:08,189
which cannot be replaced.

99
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:32,679
It is like M.S. which destroys parts of the nervous system, demyelinates parts of the nerves and that is finished

100
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:41,519
 it creates a plaque at this place and then it's finished. It's almost like that. In the beginning of M.S., you have

101
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:48,769
great success with Homeopathy. Once the plaques are formed and the paralysis is established to

102
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:56,409
that degree  then the best you can do is, hold the disease.

103
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:06,919
But with schizophrenia is even more difficult, once there are years of that condition.

104
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:28,879
I have several experiences with this type of mental disorder, which even with the best selected remedy

105
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:36,220
 I could see an amelioration for a period of
time and after a while, there is a relapse.

106
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:43,319
You repeat the remedy nothing happens. Maybe still we don't know the laws, maybe I had to repeat frequently.

107
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:47,899
 By that time I was not repeating at all.

108
00:19:47,900 --> 00:20:00,659
Maybe but my experience is that this type of mental disorder is very difficult to handle. Unless it's acute insanity

109
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:05,399
in which case you have fantastic results.

110
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:29,249
With these children, especially those who do not have this rapport with the parents, children who need that affection

111
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:37,079
who need that love but they feel 'I have done something wrong, that's why my parents do not love me.

112
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:45,639
They love my sister, they love my brother, they don't love me'. These children are expressing the emotions

113
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:51,719
through dancing and then you have dancing ameliorates.

114
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:03,470
The movement of dance expresses the
emotions that they have been holding in.

115
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:12,359
 The same with music. They enjoy
music and they feel better with music.

116
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:32,439
We have a color which is "cafe au lait". Cafe au lait is a kind of pale brown, earthy color with blue sclera.

117
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:58,229
It is very characteristic that some other keynotes are amelioration or aggravation, either of the two, in the sea.

118
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:09,149
Strong amelioration, strong aggravation in the sea. Also we have a knee-elbow position for relief

119
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:21,719
especially with the asthma, like Med. Knee-elbow position in asthma, like Kali-c., like Calc-p.

120
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:36,889
Desires also are very similar of the desires of Med. It desires salt, sweets, especially chocolate.

121
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:50,129
There is an inordinate desire for chocolate. Very strong and it has to be really strong because if you ask

122
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:53,039
who likes chocolate?

123
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:05,130
You see almost we have 90%. This is not Carc.

124
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:13,239
When they say I have to have 2 blocks of chocolate a day, then that is Carc.

125
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:24,499
That might be also Hydrophobinum
 or Phos. but mostly Carc.

126
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:43,439
Alcoholic drinks, cold drinks, fat, spicy food, chocolate, all these desire you will find in Med. as well.

127
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:04,119
It's very interesting that they have similar symptomatology. It is interesting, why?

128
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:23,129
Because it shows that the miasm of gonorrhea going through the humanity had finally ended up by aggressions

129
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:27,859
on different levels, had ended up in cancer.

130
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:42,939
This sudden expansion of tumors, which is characteristic of Med. we see here as well.

131
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:57,439
Dark moles also, a lot of moles which are very dark, which maybe in a case they come up so suddenly.

132
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:05,679
While you treat a person, moles are coming up and they are black, you have to think of Carc.

133
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:21,539
This blinking of the eyes, the abdominal pain you can find in the Repertory but the idea of Carc. has to be there

134
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:30,049
 this nice man, nice woman who cares
about others, who wants to be loved

135
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:44,089
who wants but he does not ask for love, her behavior is such that demands affection almost, without saying it.

136
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:52,579
-This blue sclera must be ?

137
00:25:53,320 --> 00:26:08,559
-No, it is not necessary. You have a case where the personality will not be of that type but still there is

138
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:18,799
amelioration in the sea, better with the knee-elbow position, desire salt, you have given Med. and has

139
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:23,829
 not acted, then your mind should go to Carc.

140
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:35,309
You have another case where it looks like Staph. She is so nice, they describes the personality and you think it is Staph.

141
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:38,959
and it has not acted, your mind should go there.

142
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:49,239
You have somebody else who says, 'I can't hear about any atrocities, any accidents, it's very painful for me'

143
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:54,559
 you have given Calc. no effect, you have to think of Carc.

144
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:17,159
-I had a patient who had a lot of these symptoms, a young girl and it came out between Puls. and Staph.

145
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:32,519
 but on the medium she was always Carc. She was about 16 and I was afraid to give it, as the first remedy.

146
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:41,233
-You can give it, no problem. You can give Carc. like you give any other remedy  there is no problem.

147
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:49,949
The problem is when you think that in every cancer case, Carc. is going to act. It's not going to act.

148
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:58,439
In every case the remedy which is indicated will act. Sometimes you will have this remedy indicated

149
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,799
at a certain phase of the treatment.

150
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:08,919
-I have two questions. One, the knee-elbow position in lying or also sitting this way?

151
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,879
-No, in lying.

152
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:22,556
-The second one is, Carc. you can give from certain potency only? Not a low potency?

153
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,109
-1x? I don't think you give 1x.

154
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,249
-Some people say that you can give it only from 200.

155
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:48,979
-You can give 12C easily but the experience is that you need a higher potency.

156
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:59,039
-We had one child and we were treating it because of neurodermatitis and the child had such a black mole

157
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:08,399
on the back and we gave Carc. The neurodermatitis went better and psychological it was much better

158
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:19,039
but the mole became a bit bigger and also a
 bit more dark. What do you say about that?

159
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,080
-That's the right direction.

160
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:39,989
- I had a Carc. patient which had such a big mole 20 cm all over the abdomen  black

161
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:46,199
and it went light brown after 3 years.

162
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:58,099
-Anybody else has experience with black moles, Carc.?

163
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:06,319
I would like to hear your experiences in this remedy  as well.

164
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:13,329
-We had somebody who had a black spot here on his upper shoulder and after 2 years of treatment

165
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:22,129
 this spot on the shoulder disappeared and afterwards on his temple a wart with hair appeared.

166
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:29,479
He still wants to dance in an extreme way.

167
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,469
-What potency he got?

168
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,919
-C200.
-One time or repeatedly?

169
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,959
-Repeated twice.

170
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:04,339
-She had a patient who had a mole on her back it was described to me as a black mole. She had previously

171
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:14,939
 removed and after treatment with Carc. for severe depression amongst many other things, the area

172
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:22,199
 where the surgery was performed began to suppurate and discharge for a period of 4 1/2 months.

173
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:28,679
Large quantities of serum and other materials. And then after that period of time it went completely

174
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:33,969
and the scar where the surgery was performed completely disappeared.

175
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:41,319
-Wait a moment. It was discharging after the remedy or before the remedy?

176
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:55,679
-After the remedy it was opened up again and began to discharge. And large quantities on regular basis.

177
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:00,259
-There was an operation, the operation healed somewhat...

178
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:05,909
-Completely. It had been a year or two before I had seen the patient.

179
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:12,669
-And then it opened up again and discharged. That's excellent reaction.

180
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:26,089
-I had a child belonging to this 1% of other Carc. types, with one of the worse neurodermatitis I ever saw.

181
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:29,319
It was violent, it was 2 years old at the time.

182
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:35,159
It would squash snails, it was very violent
and aggressive with other animals.

183
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:43,689
Really tortured his parents and was absolutely insensitive to pain.

184
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:52,649
I did not find the remedy and another Dr. gave Carc. and the neurodermatitis disappeared completely.

185
00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:07,439
-Very good. I forgot also to give this point, insensitive to pain. The opposite.

186
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:27,129
-In Germany it's said that Carc. is very dangerous to give in cancer case. A doctor has reported a case

187
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:39,629
where a pregnant woman got Carc. and the child was aborted and the mother developed cancer and died 3 years after.

188
00:33:53,730 --> 00:34:04,199
And it's said in Germany it's very dangerous to give it in cancer cases. In cancer cases it can be such aggravation

189
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,569
that you never get out.

190
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:20,159
-This is not my experience but I have given it in cancer cases and I have seen no effect. That is true.

191
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:24,149
Real cancer. I mean end stage cancer.

192
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:36,289
But to have this kind of reaction also maybe I put a question mark because the abortion does not necessarily mean

193
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:39,809
 that it comes because of Carc.

194
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:46,269
The abortion may be programmed already and it would happen in any case.

195
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:59,259
In the same way that you give the wrong remedy and something happens to the organism, he has a heart attack

196
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:10,529
 or he has suicide and then you say, oh I gave Med. and he committed suicide. So be careful of Med.

197
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:19,919
I have my doubts concerning such severe reactions. I have not seen it. Maybe, I don't know.

198
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:43,549
- You said that people who need Carc. are rather fastidious and do you observe also this permanent control

199
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:48,539
 if the door is locked or the stove is switched off?

200
00:35:48,540 --> 00:36:05,719
-This fastidiousness is there. You get a child who is very organized. I would say perfectionist, these children

201
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:13,819
are perfectionists, they want to do everything very correctly and they do it in a natural manner.

202
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:23,569
They are not forcing themselves to do that. It is natural, that's why we say fastidious is one of the elements.

203
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:41,089
Now going back I have not seen a case cured in this problem with Carc.  I don't know, maybe somebody has seen it.

204
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:49,089
-George, I also have a question in those Carc. children. Do we know anything about if they develop cancer later

205
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:55,099
 if they are not treated because sometimes
 you hear talking about cancer personality.

206
00:36:55,100 --> 00:37:01,819
It's a soft person, non aggressive,
doesn't fight for its needs.

207
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:16,289
-I don't believe that. I have seen cancer cases developing in very lively persons, very extroverts, bon viveurs

208
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:23,439
 dolce vita people and suddenly... the cancer comes.

209
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:37,959
I don't believe that you have a cancer personality. What I believe is that all the chemicals and the influence

210
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:50,519
of the environment and the influence of the stressors that come to the organism, eventually push

211
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,279
the organism towards this direction.

212
00:37:53,280 --> 00:38:04,039
And this is why because we have means of stopping the intermediate reactions. People will not die now

213
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:14,039
from an acute condition easily. We have the means to stop it and then the organism gets the effect

214
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,699
 and keeps the effect inside.

215
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:23,789
I have a case I'm treating with Tourette's syndrome. It's terrible case.

216
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:36,039
Where the man has no feelings, no connections, it's almost a case of schizophrenia.

217
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:47,889
And he goes with that he does all kinds
 of movements and he holds back.

218
00:38:54,440 --> 00:39:07,199
Taking his story he says, 'I remember when I was 5 years old, I had a pneumonia and the doctor said that

219
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,047
I will die most probably from the pneumonia. They gave me a lot of penicillin. It was in the beginning

220
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:23,799
of penicillin era. They gave me a lot of penicillin and I felt since that time, the disease stays inside me.

221
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:32,819
After a while I started doing movements' and then he started doing different things. He cannot touch if I touched this

222
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:41,569
 and then it developed into a terrific state of suffering.

223
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:50,639
If you meet him, you will not understand anything but inside he says, 'I have no feelings, I have no enjoyment

224
00:39:50,640 --> 00:40:01,039
 I've never felt what is life but I feel a cold
running in my body without breaking out ever'.

225
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:12,219
He never got an acute. He, himself does not know the theory. He said, 'how can I get a cold?'

226
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:27,409
'George I almost got a cold, I need a cold to break out what has stayed inside since the age of 5'.

227
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:35,179
He is 39 now. He was saved from the pneumonia of course.

228
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:48,359
-The Carc. people or children would you say that they might take on some mission which is too difficult for them?

229
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:56,639
-They are duty bound. They feel that they have to perform their duty. 'This is my duty, I have to go to school. '

230
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:02,439
You tell them now you have to go to school.
 They listen, so 'I have to go to school'.

231
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:06,969
 Every day they have to go to school, they cannot miss a day of the school.

232
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:17,819
This is a mission, if you stretch it you
may take it as the idea of a mission.

233
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:34,079
-I had a patient who identified himself with some duties he got as a child. He was at the kibbutz.

234
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:49,239
He was born in a children's house and he didn't see his parents too much and he identified his parents

235
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:57,399
in the kibbutz in the children group. Anyway when the kibbutz movement became disintegrating

236
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:08,519
 in the last few years, it's changing, it's not the same, he told me that he was trying to revive it. And he identified

237
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:21,169
himself with the movement, he felt he was disintegrating too. I was wondering if this is a characteristic for Carc.

238
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:24,730
-Not necessarily.

239
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:43,124
-I'm sorry I didn't understand, if you gave Carc.  to the Tourette man? What remedy he needed?

240
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:49,390
-I have tried half of the Materia Medica so far.

241
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:10,359
 By the way the last remedy I've given is Carc.
 I don't know the results yet.

242
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:25,969
It's a very severe mental and neurological case and I just keep him and he says, without Homeopathy

243
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:35,959
 I would have been in insane asylum.
He feels he is in the limits.

244
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:48,689
-Do you also observe like the opposite of being timid and careful so that sometimes you find some people

245
00:43:48,690 --> 00:44:03,519
like this type who is very duty bound and proper and then they talk about bungy jumping or parachute jumping?

246
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:21,609
-Parachute jumping I don't know. What I know is that these people are stimulated in their mental part and they need

247
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:35,350
 food for their mental activity. Where they find food for their mental activity? In reading stories, books.

248
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:45,359
 Most of them they will read a lot of stories books and some of them will go of course more to the science

249
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:53,679
  and concentrate on reading and accumulating scientific knowledge.

250
00:44:53,680 --> 00:45:04,999
They are book worms and they live through this their fantasies and their emotions because the books is a safe place

251
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:10,159
 to live the emotions, the stories in the books.

252
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:23,969
But not all the people who read a lot of books, they need Carc. You have to get the feeling that these people

253
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:37,199
are really vulnerable, they will be very easily hurt and therefore the book gives them a safe place to play their emotions.

254
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:43,440
That is the idea.

255
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:53,449
Like dancing also, they release their emotions, listening to music they release their emotions.

256
00:45:53,450 --> 00:46:02,759
 But especially reading romantic stories,
 they are not aggressive in sexual matters.

257
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:13,529
Some they have a little bit more energy for sex and some others they have less, they are going towards the impotency.

258
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:31,769
But the emotional side is very vulnerable, you looked at me in a kind that you put me down. They feel it inside.

259
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:38,529
Even the look, even the little hint is felt.

260
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:47,639
-I want to ask how the emotions change after having taken Carc.

261
00:46:47,640 --> 00:47:06,449
-They become less vulnerable, this is definite. About the sexual? This remedy does not have a particular effect

262
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:19,699
 on the sexual sphere. I have not seen excessive sexual desire or total disinterest.

263
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:20,809
It's something in between.

264
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:31,780
 Therefore the effect is not something which you are asking or you are investigating a lot with this remedy.
