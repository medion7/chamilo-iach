1
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:41,199
I want to give you the picture of Op. in a
 nutshell and compare it with Nux-m.

2
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:49,949
You will sometimes vacillate
 between these two remedies.

3
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:21,699
The reason is that both have a tendency to sleep which is so great that they can fall asleep anytime.

4
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,750
Who has added Ant-t?

5
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:59,419
Pierre Schmidt, maybe.

6
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:17,999
What I want to explain to you now is the kind
 of sleepiness, which we have with Op.

7
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:29,479
Before I explain I want
 to give you some facts.

8
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:46,059
When somebody is in coma, we say the best remedy we have to bring out of the coma a patient is with Op.  correct?

9
00:02:53,580 --> 00:03:13,530
Op. produces a state in which the brain has the tendency from being sleepy to being totally asleep with coma.

10
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:40,730
In this process sleepy to coma, there are stages, in which Op. is sleeping so heavily so deeply that says, snoring.

11
00:03:48,890 --> 00:04:01,509
There is a respiration which is arrested with Op. during sleep, so much that the person who sleeps

12
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:17,489
usually Op. are men, the woman does
 not does not hear.... stops. Nothing.

13
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:26,230
.... are you alive?

14
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:54,220
What is the underlying pathology?
 Where it's localized?

15
00:04:54,260 --> 00:05:04,499
 It's localized primarily in a malfunctioning
of the thyroid. Low function of the thyroid.

16
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,570
Low pathological function.

17
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:28,779
As a result we have obesity, Op. people
 are usually fat, really fat, huge.

18
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:54,939
You have to realize now that such people who can sleep so easily, when they sleep they go so deep

19
00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:00,160
into the process of sleeping.

20
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:18,279
When we want to stop somebody from being very restless, alive, we give Ritalin. What it does?

21
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:35,089
More opiates in the brain, so the person feels quite happy and can go to sleep very easily. This is the idea of Op.

22
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:46,349
This picture is the pathological picture of Op.

23
00:06:54,350 --> 00:07:05,688
You remember Nux-m. The sleepiness
also is there, overpowering, why?

24
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:17,999
Because we said she is in the beginning
 stages of sleep all the time.

25
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:25,580
Because the etheric body is out,
 is detached already.

26
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:36,589
In order to sleep you have to
allow your etheric body to come out.

27
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:40,116
 You don't do it consciously. It just happens.

28
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:53,639
But if you are anxious, if you are thinking all the time, you have a problem, you cannot sleep.

29
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:10,889
Because your mind is there, is aware. You don't allow yourself to relax and say,' I'm lying down now, I'm going to sleep'.

30
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:24,609
If you have a grief, you have been insulted, you have been rejected by your boyfriend, girlfriend.

31
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:41,079
Especially these facts will keep you awake the whole night. Because you are thinking, she insulted me or jealousy.

32
00:08:47,820 --> 00:09:03,860
So in order to sleep you have to relax to let the brain flood with opiates, with serotonin more.

33
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,110
 And then you relax, you go to sleep.

34
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:42,330
The psychological state of Nux-m. is that
she is in a wonderful, dream world.

35
00:09:42,331 --> 00:10:00,180
Op. is not so much dreaming because  the opiates are much more overpowering and he just goes straight to sleep.

36
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:16,739
But all these remedies, in the process between going to sleep and be ready to sleep, they have delusions

37
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:30,259
 because they are in another world. They are entering and going out to the dream world.

38
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:36,932
That is why there are delusions. All of
these remedies they have delusions.

39
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:47,739
Later on we'll speak about Cann-i.
 and I will give you the comparison.

40
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:59,959
So the Op. will be used, as I said,
 in the coma from whatever reason.

41
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:14,569
Whether it is a brain stroke or
whether it is a tremendous stress.

42
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:36,140
The Op. state comes when the person
 has to face and unsurpassed fright.

43
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:42,689
 A fright with which the person
 feels I cannot deal.

44
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:57,969
Then the organism gives up at this moment and in order to survive there are opiates in the brain.

45
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:28,709
By the way, if there is an earthquake, don't move because this is an earthquake proof building.

46
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:46,289
Op. can be given once you are out but if everybody tries to get out at the same time, some injuries

47
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:53,899
will happen on the way out, not because
 the building will be falling.

48
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:13,019
Once I was teaching in Rousoum Yalos, in a small room, I had put 100 people in half of this. They were packed absolutely.

49
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:24,709
And an earthquake comes and there were benches, no corridors, one had to jump over the other.

50
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:39,819
I saw some of them they stood up, ready to go out, through a small door like this, with glasses. They would break

51
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:55,879
the glasses. I said, sit down, don't be afraid. The building is safe, don't move. Nobody moved.

52
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:05,559
An earthquake that could have
killed actually because of the fear.

53
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:15,570
The earthquake is something you feel,
it's not something that you can control.

54
00:14:15,571 --> 00:14:27,359
You don't know when the building will be falling but here in Greece we have been through a lot of such phenomena.

55
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:38,009
We got used to them and the buildings
 are built in such a way that ...

56
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:46,090
Op. has different other symptoms but at this moment I don't want to mention, not to confuse you

57
00:14:46,091 --> 00:14:58,569
 because the idea is to get the total impression
 of the person who needs this remedy.

58
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:05,929
I think I gave you enough
information to remember.

59
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:18,839
An interesting other remedy which
connects with Nux-m. and with Op. is Cann-i.

60
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:32,159
What Cann-i. is doing?

61
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:13,369
The first effect of Cann-i. is to create a situation in the brain where the brain is running too fast.

62
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:28,859
The brain starts being stimulated, starts
 having ideas, one after another.

63
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:52,109
And these ideas have to be expressed. So the Cann-i. patient will feel that he has to understand and to express

64
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,339
a theory about everything.

65
00:16:54,340 --> 00:17:03,760
It is something similar to Sulph.
but this situation is pathological.

66
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:17,560
It is not a philosopher who
 is investigating. It is superficial.

67
00:17:17,561 --> 00:17:28,969
 Any problem that appears with the Cann-i.,
has to be solved and putting a theory situation.

68
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:41,899
So you have a brain that is stimulated and it is running and then it becomes loquacity.

69
00:17:43,670 --> 00:18:03,089
Theorizing, loquacity. The brain is stimulated and the stimulation is such that it does not allow the Cann-i. person to stay grounded.

70
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:19,448
It flies away and that is the time when
delusions and illusions start manifesting.

71
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:48,060
Cann-i. is perhaps the number one remedy for having illusions, delusions and perceptions of hearing thing

72
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:52,589
seeing things out of reality.

73
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:12,410
You have to understand that a person who is under the control of Cann-i., cannot control anymore.

74
00:19:12,411 --> 00:19:22,079
So the idea comes to the person
that I cannot control my mind.

75
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:32,000
And I need to control, I need to be grounded.

76
00:19:32,001 --> 00:19:43,629
 The Cann-i. peoplee they will express anxiety about their own health and mostly the anxiety

77
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:51,989
 goes towards the fear of
losing their sanity, loosing their mind.

78
00:19:55,210 --> 00:20:07,470
The speed with which the brain is going out of control, is bringing as a secondary effect, this fear

79
00:20:07,471 --> 00:20:12,689
'I'm losing control, I'm losing my mind'.

80
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:27,620
Once that state is established, we have a syndrome with these people of panic attacks

81
00:20:27,621 --> 00:20:33,629
which can really lead them to total craziness.

82
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:37,670
There is no control at all.

83
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:47,839
Can you imagine somebody 20
hours a day thinking I'm getting crazy?

84
00:20:49,870 --> 00:21:02,540
Sometimes this fear becomes so big that there is tremendous panic and they need the support of the doctor

85
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:07,600
they need the support of somebody to talk.

86
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:25,080
What is important for us to understand is
that such a mind that has gone out of control...

87
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:41,599
...is ready for the mental asylum,
so severe condition.

88
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:58,609
In their delusions, during this time, they feel that their body is leaving them. They cannot control it, they cannot bring it back.

89
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:15,270
Sometimes in their panic, they will see parts
of their body... they will see the hand lifted.

90
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:24,771
Without moving the hand but
they see it coming out.

91
00:22:24,772 --> 00:22:39,289
You can see how Cann-i. brings the brain in such a state where dream and reality are mixed together.

92
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:54,260
Why people get caught in this
habit of taking marihuana?

93
00:22:54,261 --> 00:23:09,579
Because this pathology which we describe comes after a lot of use of marihuana, in one hand.

94
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:17,860
On the other hand comes when the
organism is weak towards this direction.

95
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:27,119
It has a weak defense mechanism and
it's ready to go out of control.

96
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:48,300
As I said other times, the young boys who are using marihuana and they go again and again and take it

97
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:55,059
if it gives them these panic attacks, they stop.

98
00:23:55,060 --> 00:24:04,841
The panic attacks are so strong that after this, they stop. But the boys don't stop they usually go on and take it, why?

99
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:30,049
Because it creates a state of pleasant feelings, a state in which they say I feel that I have more love for others.

100
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:41,979
You remember the movement of Beatles, in 60's? You are young, you don't remember the 60's.

101
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:53,580
Anyhow the Beatles in the 60's they found out and they say "don't make war, make love".

102
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:05,719
That was the idea they promoted.

103
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:13,240
How came this? It was because of marihuana.

104
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:27,689
Because marihuana in the beginning stages, as it increases the pleasure in the brain, it increases the desire for sexual contact.

105
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:46,010
Therefore we have people with stimulated brains and stimulated sexual desire, which eventually is going to destroy both

106
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:49,309
 the brain and the sexual desire.

107
00:25:49,310 --> 00:26:04,430
In the end the people who use marihuana frequently, while they were having excessive sexual activity

108
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:08,659
eventually they become impotent.

109
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:29,110
I remember a case from (?) I remember a young man, very good looking, he was brought by an older woman

110
00:26:29,111 --> 00:26:31,540
 as a companion.

111
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:40,320
As I found out he could nothing
sexually but anyhow.

112
00:26:40,321 --> 00:26:46,369
 He gave me the story how
 he had become totally impotent.

113
00:26:46,370 --> 00:27:00,450
He says, 'we used with other people , we marihuana and one day in a party, I used marihuana

114
00:27:00,451 --> 00:27:07,599
that was 7 times more than
 the usual dose', they used to take.

115
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:17,769
They were group of men and women. He had several times, that night, sexual contact.

116
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:31,150
He says, 'when I woke up in the morning
 after sleeping, I was totally finished.

117
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:45,999
 I used to be a camera man in television and he says, 'I tried to go to my work and I tried to look through the camera

118
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,120
 and it was not possible for me to
concentrate my eyes through the camera.

119
00:27:54,250 --> 00:28:05,599
I was totally exhausted. I was empty emotionally, I was empty in my mind, I had no thinking. I was totally empty.'

120
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:14,259
Out of this excessive stimulation that
 forced this organism to go through.

121
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:21,579
So he was really a wreck.

122
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:32,440
His case reminded me of what?

123
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:36,639
Cann-i.?
 No. Not anymore.

124
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:46,730
Now the Cann-i. picture is gone and
now his picture was indicating Ph-ac.

125
00:28:46,731 --> 00:28:51,529
 That was a picture of Ph-ac.

126
00:28:54,860 --> 00:29:06,639
I remember I told him, 'if you want, I don't know if I can cure you. Maybe you damage yourself irrepairably'.

127
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:13,510
Take this remedy and I will advise
you to go back to Italy, he was from Italy.

128
00:29:13,511 --> 00:29:26,160
 Go back to Italy, leave the work,
go and become a sheep leader.

129
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:38,959
Take some sheep and take them around in the mountains and let them graze and drink the milk and eat

130
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:49,709
 very clean food and maybe after 2-3 years
you may get back your organism'.

131
00:29:49,730 --> 00:30:05,449
I don't know whether he followed my advice or at this moment is looking at the grass from the wrong side.

132
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:46,540
Such is the effect of this wonderful spiritual drug, such is the real effect. It ends up to that state.

133
00:30:46,541 --> 00:30:51,749
And some politicians  they want to let it free.

134
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:58,939
 There is no problem, let it free,
let everybody become a drug addict.

135
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:15,669
And everybody knows that
marihuana is the great door to hard drugs.

136
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:30,890
They start all of them with marihuana then cocaine, then heroine and then  a hero who died at the age of 28.

137
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,130
This is terrible.

138
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:19,619
The one is Op. the other is a kind of opiate, yet the pictures are not the same, you cannot confuse.

139
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:36,479
Op. even if they have paresthesia, even if they have some delusions, you will never see them going into panic attacks.

140
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,160
Very happy.

141
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:58,369
Sometimes I have prescribed Op. without really the person having taken any Op. at all or anything like that.

142
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:15,619
From his physical pleasure that you will see, a materialistic person, who enjoys life but in a sleepy way.

143
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:32,840
Where the other one, the Cann-i.,
you will see the stimulation.

144
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:41,709
 They talk, talk, they come to you and give different theories. They tell you they have an explanation

145
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:51,569
for everything which happens, you are
thinking is this a Lach. case, no. Is this that?

146
00:33:51,570 --> 00:34:10,209
Then, if you know the remedy, the mind will go to Cann-i. and then if you ask about their anxiety concerning their health

147
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:16,399
 from the very beginning stages,
 there is already quite a strong anxiety.

148
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:38,539
Anxiety and fear. Fears, delusions, illusions, they hear noises, voices, they see phantoms, they see terrible things.

149
00:34:41,780 --> 00:35:00,730
This is the situation, this is the differentiation. Op. also has many times strong constipation.

150
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:08,339
But some other times there is
 constipation alternating with diarrhea.

151
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:11,609
And some other times there is diarrhea.

152
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:21,489
You don't have to have like Alum.
Alum. is a mind which is not clear.

153
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:34,160
This kind of mind is sleepy.
The mind of Nux-m. is dreamy.

154
00:35:34,161 --> 00:35:44,699
The mind of Cann-i. is stimulated and
 stimulated and lives in a world of ideas.

155
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:50,580
Ideas without coherence, without use.

156
00:35:53,010 --> 00:36:00,359
Somebody is thinking about his job , he has some thoughts, maybe quite a lot of ideas.

157
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:04,259
This is not Cann-i. because they have purpose.

158
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:16,839
With Cann-i. people  the theories have no purpose, they have no end. They can make a theory for everything.

159
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:35,599
A mind that cannot rest. And eventually they become like invalids, not invalids exactly.

160
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:44,699
Because a lot of people they
 get out of this habit. That is true.

161
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:51,510
They can get out, once they
have a little bit of power.

162
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:05,249
But almost everyone who made excessive
 use of marihuana  almost everyone

163
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:15,300
 has this particular mind which
 is a mind, which is gullible.

164
00:37:15,401 --> 00:37:22,640
 They will accept anything.

165
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:40,590
You can tell them, I found a remedy which is panacea. And this remedy you can go and buy it there or find it there.

166
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:48,259
They will go and try to find the remedy. They don't examine whether this can be logical or not.

167
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:50,989
  You can tell them anything.

168
00:37:51,630 --> 00:38:08,179
I saw the other day a man from Sirius, I saw
him walking in our street. And they say yes.

169
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:31,440
These people say, 'oh yes!'.

170
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:46,029
Especially if you tell them things of
supernatural phenomena. They will accept.

171
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:50,770
George, why not?

172
00:38:55,460 --> 00:39:17,279
Somebody was telling me that he had an
intuition that such a remedy will cure cancer.

173
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:34,519
He had an intuition, that means it's a serious thing. Let's find out about his intuition, they don't investigate.

174
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:45,250
I told you the other day about
this psychiatrist, 45 years old.

175
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:55,319
 He said to me how you came in
contact with Homeopathy? I said, why?

176
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:02,920
He said 'because I hear the story'. 'What story?', 'That you were in the car and the car was crushed

177
00:40:02,921 --> 00:40:13,729
the door opened, you were thrown unconscious in the street and this book fell from the sky on your lap.

178
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:19,380
You woke up, you opened the
book and you said that's it'.

179
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:30,459
I couldn't believe, he is a psychiatrist, he is attending my classes, he wants to become a homeopath.

180
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:33,589
I said, 'have you used marihuana?'

181
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,169
 'Oh yes, sure'.

182
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:49,315
I go next day to the class, the Americans, it was a class like this size. I said, who has used marihuana?

183
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:58,979
All the hands are up. I said OK, who
 has not used marihuana?

184
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:22,280
I'm talking about 1983-84, around that
time drugs were very much in fashion.

185
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:34,609
They were different ideas about these drugs that the humanity could become more spiritual, if they use marihuana.

186
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:40,090
Actually I tell you a secret.

187
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:57,450
 If there was a group of people who are controlling the planet, through financial and ammunitions, armies etc.

188
00:41:57,451 --> 00:42:12,789
and they wanted to make the planet, the people to be subdued and not revolt to anything they would impose

189
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:17,099
they would promote marihuana.

190
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:29,609
This group will not touch marihuana but marihuana is very good for the people, so it can spread.

191
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:43,549
And there are politicians, people with some logic, just because they used it themselves, they say why it's not good?

192
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:54,309
Cigarette? You don't dare smoke anymore, cigarette is very bad, marihuana is OK, it's free.

193
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:05,289
Can you imagine this kind of understanding in the human race, what is going to be the effect on the human race?

194
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:15,119
If you want to become a puppet and they will tell you this and you believe it, marihuana is the best.

195
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:28,120
Marihuana should be spread and everybody should take marihuana. Even Bill Clinton.

196
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:43,759
He came out publically and the journalist
 said, did you use marihuana?

197
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,790
He said, yes I used marihuana.

198
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:57,630
 Even the President of the USA admitted publically he was using marihuana.

199
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:08,040
And the people will say, why not? If Clinton who is such a clever guy uses marihuana, maybe I will become also clever

200
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:10,740
 by using marihuana.

201
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:24,529
Marihuana is damaging because you
cannot force, you cannot open areas...

202
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:34,550
Our brain has all the possibilities of the world, you cannot imagine the possibilities of our brain.

203
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:39,939
But these possibilities are closed, are blocked.

204
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:46,550
You can stimulate and open some possibilities.

205
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:57,649
You can open some possibilities which
are beyond your capacity to handle.

206
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:09,439
But if you stimulate, the possibility may come and then you have what they call a spiritual experience.

207
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:18,110
But you will be paying later on for this spiritual experience because it's very interesting, very nice.

208
00:45:18,111 --> 00:45:27,609
But if you repeat it again and again, one day you're going to pay and your brain will be burned out.

209
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:39,449
These are my experiences concerning the drugs.

210
00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:07,930
George is conservative. I'm not conservative, I'm open to everything but at the same time I have my critical mind, right there.

211
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:15,079
You can come and tell me anything,
I will listen, I will judge it.

212
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:31,649
But if I had not the experience that I have seen all these dramatic lives, the drama in the lives of the young people.

213
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:41,999
You cannot imagine what dramas the
 families of such people are going through.

214
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:52,449
I don't know in Germany today but in
Greece today the problem is dramatic.

215
00:46:54,440 --> 00:47:03,119
Because we're retarded. The "good" things
 are coming with retardation in Greece.

216
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:08,619
First come to America, then
England until it reaches here.

217
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:15,829
Now it has reached here the problem.

218
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:24,019
Is anybody who wants to
contradict what I have said?

219
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:41,200
That means you all agree.

220
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:53,270
 The main thing is really not to go and experiment. It's a bad experiment.

221
00:47:53,800 --> 00:48:03,979
When I was in India I met with an American and an English man. We investigated about spiritual people.

222
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:15,120
Both they used to take drugs. The American was in an ashram and there he had stopped. The English was free.

223
00:48:15,121 --> 00:48:24,499
So they were debating and I could observe how the English would persuade eventually the American

224
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:37,709
 who had stopped for a year, taking drugs and how cunningly he was trying to make him also take marihuana.

225
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:45,430
He tried with me. I said forget it.
He understood there is no place.

226
00:48:45,431 --> 00:48:53,859
But the American, he could see he was ready and then he left and the American stayed with me.

227
00:48:53,860 --> 00:49:03,270
And I said, 'you are fool, if you take, you
 are fool'. And he said, 'maybe I will not take'.

228
00:49:03,271 --> 00:49:09,280
 The next day, the same. The third day,
 he had taken marihuana.

229
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:23,300
-I want to tell about a patient I had once that he never took marihuana but one day he had a blow in his head

230
00:49:23,301 --> 00:49:30,130
and a voice told him "Vittorio is Christ".

231
00:49:56,020 --> 00:50:00,399
  A delusion, without taking any drugs.

232
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:09,539
-That's absolutely. I don't say that all crazy people  have taken marihuana. No, I don't claim this.

233
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:26,890
What you describe is a case of schizophrenia where people become Napoleon or Christ or whatever.

234
00:50:26,891 --> 00:50:40,669
That means there was a trauma in his brain which inflamed an area and opened an area.

235
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:51,210
-No, no. He had a stressful life at his home, with his wife and afterwards at his job who cracked down

236
00:50:51,211 --> 00:50:59,209
that was overstressed. That was
 the reason he got in a Cann-i. state.

237
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:03,269
And he was so happy for weeks.

238
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:11,610
And his family said, our father is crazy
we must bring him to a mental hospital.

239
00:51:11,611 --> 00:51:16,729
And then they gave him a lot of
drugs and he got depressed.

240
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:20,079
-Did you treat him?

241
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:25,840
-We gave him Cann-i.
-And it had an effect?

242
00:51:25,841 --> 00:51:27,079
-Of course.

243
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,290
-Very good.

244
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:45,469
 This is what I say. You may have a blow and you don't need Arn, the organism develops a picture of a different remedy.

245
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:51,139
-It was not a physical blow. He had
 like an explosion in his head.

246
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:56,540
-Yes, the same thing. It's not different.

247
00:51:56,541 --> 00:52:09,209
A stress which has come over his possibility to deal with the stress, it has an effect. There is no question.

248
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:21,220
The stress was too huge for his organism to handle it and that is why the predisposition which he was having

249
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:32,969
  from his parents, came up as a mental problem.

250
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:45,329
There must have been a predisposition in order with a big stress to have this change in the brain.

251
00:52:46,330 --> 00:53:03,509
It's very interesting that the brain controls so much our life that whatever happens in our brain, is not possible to fight against.

252
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:23,830
You can fight against everything which happens in our body but once you get the idea in the brain

253
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:38,679
 that you have cancer and this idea overtakes the brain, then forget it. Nobody can take it out from your mind.

254
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:48,519
It's so powerful. I have cancer and the word cancer brings you into a panic state.

255
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:14,079
-George could you maybe tell us about your experience with people  who are using alcohol excessively?

256
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:39,139
- The excessive use of alcohol brings to the mind remedies like Cann-i. also and when it comes to the real

257
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:53,820
deep alcoholic state where they see demons and phantoms and delusions, such remedies as Cann-i.

258
00:54:53,821 --> 00:55:02,459
are the main remedies that can be
used in deep alcoholic cases.

259
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:22,449
Of course remedies that affect the liver also could be useful in alcoholic people but you see another

260
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:29,189
argument is when alcohol became
free. What happend?

261
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:39,640
 The alcoholics all over the world became
 from a few thousand to a few millions.

262
00:55:39,641 --> 00:55:45,269
 Not a few, many millions of alcoholics.

263
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:49,380
Because it's free.

264
00:55:52,550 --> 00:56:09,209
 If marihuana is left free, the world will go into a state of zomby. Whatever they tell you, you will say yes.

265
00:56:14,290 --> 00:56:25,180
No, we are making a peaceful
revolution in medicine.

266
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:37,130
 Never bombs, never kill. Only save
lives, I hope. This is my wish for you.
