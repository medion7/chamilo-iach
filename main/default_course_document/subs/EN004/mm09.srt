1
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:44,484
Very sympathetic people who are really affected by the environment and what takes place socially in the environment.

2
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:52,124
What takes socially in the environment, is of great concern to them.

3
00:00:53,040 --> 00:01:03,404
If somebody is treating unjustly or they think somebody is treating unjustly somebody else,

4
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:11,230
they are the first to interfere and immediately react. They say, 'Hey, what are you doing there?'

5
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:27,754
So they have a nervous system which is in an excitable state and therefore in a precarious state.

6
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:46,124
They are very excitable people, very aware, looking. The nervous system is really in a great excitement.

7
00:01:46,200 --> 00:02:00,260
So therefore it can easily break down. In Caust. we see that the nervous system breaks down and eventually paralysis comes.

8
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:13,230
First there is excitement, the nervous system is weak, not strong, they cannot stand in injustice.

9
00:02:13,306 --> 00:02:18,464
They cannot stand see things suffering.

10
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:39,724
With them it's mostly suffering socially, which affects them. Physical suffering affects mostly the Phos. case.

11
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:49,840
If somebody has pains and Phos. is there, Phos. will be very concerned.

12
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:57,014
Caust. is sympathetic towards the social suffering of others.

13
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:09,834
Also physical suffering but mostly social. Especially suppressing others.

14
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:22,764
Especially think that somebody is treated unjustly, they cannot tolerate. They have to shout, they have to fight.

15
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:47,184
Caust. can really fight in the street because of the injustice and Caust. will join parties that are concerned with social justice.

16
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:54,404
'I must do something'. They cannot just leave it alone.

17
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:07,394
This is the idea behind Caust. and that is why the sympathetic element is so strong.

18
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:18,444
But I remember for instance a case, when I was in India, there was the labor ward in India there are no doors.

19
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:28,204
They had just a curtain and then there are others lying there and they can hear the woman suffering.

20
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:40,004
So there was another man who was sick and he would close his ears.

21
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:50,124
Everybody could see he was suffering very much while the woman was giving birth to a child.

22
00:04:51,030 --> 00:05:04,164
I remember by this time, in the School I was in Calcutta, students were studying and also teachers and

23
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:15,900
they did not know the difference between sympathetic of Phos. and sympathetic of Caust.

24
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:22,684
So they gave this person, everyone said, give Caust.. Of course nothing happened.

25
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:32,440
By that time they would not use in the School, they did not know even the Repertory.

26
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:40,234
 They would just read from some Materia Medicas but the comparative value of each remedy was not known.

27
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:49,574
They give Caust. because in the keynotes Caust. is very sympathetic. It did nothing.

28
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:55,004
I said no, this is a Phos. case. You give it Phos..

29
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:01,764
Once he took Phos., he calmed down and he stopped complaining. He said, I can't hear.

30
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:11,924
 Phos. cannot hear somebody suffering physically. Caust. cannot hear somebody suffering socially.

31
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:29,084
Primarily. Because both they have concern, they are affected by pain, suffering etc. But primarily it is sympathetic on a social level.

32
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:56,264
They rebel against authority. Sometimes they will come, they join anarchistic groups and they bring justice

33
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:12,150
by throwing a bomb which is actually a kind of madness. You don't kill somebody to bring justice.

34
00:07:12,226 --> 00:07:23,760
But for Caust. and for Arg-n also, they can throw bombs. Arg-n also they like some justice but not as much as this one.

35
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:44,374
Mercurius they feel inside them that they want to do some violence; they have some impulse to do things.

36
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:54,694
 Impulse to kill, impulse to throw things. Impulse which they try to control and sometimes it may happen

37
00:07:54,770 --> 00:08:04,344
 also this kind social reaction but mostly is with a home situation.

38
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:16,150
They like to throw things in their immediate environment, to the wife.

39
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:29,104
Nux vomica no.

40
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:46,854
Of course, if you see injustice, everyone is affected but we see injustice and we don't jump and start

41
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:54,624
punching the person who does the injustice. The Caust. cannot but do something.

42
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:10,474
He will see something happening in the streets, somebody who is attacked; he will jump into the situation. We don't do it.

43
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,644
For Caust. is very important, he cannot help it.

44
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:31,824
The most characteristic is the paralysis of single parts. Paralysis of vocal chords.

45
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:36,994
You see the voice is lost and they talk like this suddenly.

46
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:52,114
There is a paralysis which comes after a cold. They get a cold, they got paralysis.

47
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:57,174
Bell's palsy. They are paralyzed on one side of the face.

48
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:15,604
The urethra is one special point, especially with women, which is not functioning properly. It's almost paralyzed.

49
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:33,334
That means they have to run very fast, otherwise they will lose urine. And if it happens that there is a pressure from the diaphragm

50
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:45,324
a pressure down in the abdomen and the urinary bladder is pressed, a little bit of urine always goes out.

51
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:54,644
So whether they are laughing, sneezing, coughing, they lose a little bit of urine.

52
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:05,654
Of course there are other remedies which they have that but for this remedy is very characteristic.

53
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:22,804
Another characteristic is that the excitement which they have, makes them unable to speak out their emotions easily.

54
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:35,284
The more the excitement, the more the stammering. They start stammering once they get a little bit excited.

55
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:42,454
If they get more excited, more stammering. If they get very excited, they cannot speak.

56
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:56,194
While other times when they are calm, they can speak. You don't even notice that they have that kind of stammering.

57
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,114
This is similar with Mercury.

58
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:24,924
Another characteristic of the pains. The pains are felt as if the flesh is raw. That means the skin is off.

59
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:41,770
All the pains wherever they may be they feel raw, the pains are raw. As if the flesh has lost its protection.

60
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:59,404
No protection you see? So outside influence aggravates them.

61
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:19,844
So you understood the idea. I have no protection that means I receive the outside impressions as if I have no skin.

62
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:30,124
The pain feels as if they have no skin, the skin is gone and even the air can make this painful.

63
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:36,034
All the pains feeling as if raw.

64
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:55,634
Constipation. It is an interesting point, stool passes better when it is standing.

65
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:08,149
This is very unnatural because the stool passes better when you sit; the deepest you sit, the better.

66
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:15,790
Here is a very strange symptom.

67
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:36,804
The aggravation in Caust. is from dry weather. It is very strange because usually people are affected by wet cold weather.

68
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,884
Here they are affected by dry weather.

69
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:51,044
And they feel good in wet weather. How is that ? We cannot explain.

70
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:13,204
Desire for smoked meat. Which is the other remedy that desires smoked meat? Calc-p.

71
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:22,084
What is the weather that aggravates Calc-p?

72
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:33,724
Cold, wet. This is aggravated by cold, dry.

73
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:47,124
Another thing that we usually find in Caust. is they don't like sweets. Sweets? No, I'm not interested.

74
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:53,284
Either they have an aversion or no interest for sweets.

75
00:15:54,940 --> 00:16:03,894
The desire for sweets is something you don't take it as a symptom unless it is too extreme.

76
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:12,644
Somebody says, I live on sweets, this is a symptom. But because everybody likes sweets, who likes sweets?

77
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:27,684
Who does not like sweets? Fewer persons do not like sweets.

78
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:45,844
Those who do not like sweets usually are thin persons. They have a better combustion.

79
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:57,444
They take the glucose and they use it, so they don't need extra glucose because they have enough

80
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:02,684
from the farinaceous food which they take.

81
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:14,634
That means the combustion is better, so usually the aversion to sweets is together with lean people.

82
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:27,244
Sugar, chocolate, whatever is a sweet taste these people do not like.

83
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:40,254
They have no specific desire or aversion for fruits, we don't know. What we know is that they have aversion to sweets.

84
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:57,404
There are people also who suffer because of grieves. The Caust., as I said, is an impressionable person.

85
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:06,514
They are going through different grieves in life, one and another one and another one.

86
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:15,494
They are not the people who will complain, go around, find friends.

87
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:22,244
On the contrary they are people who collect the suffering of the others.

88
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:32,844
Collect the suffering, finally they come to the point where themselves develop a disease.

89
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:47,114
They are usually people who are closed. What happens to you? This, that and he is involved.

90
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:58,334
But to come himself to tell you that I have this problem, I have a child, it has done this to me

91
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:18,400
 I have a wife or my husband has done that, no. The healthy people exchange this information easily.

92
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:25,384
 Healthy people will talk about their problems, their friends, they need that exchange.

93
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:43,734
Once the disease starts coming, then there is if I tell, I'll be humiliated. If I tell, they laugh. If I tell, they are not interested.

94
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:56,924
If I tell, I will give them a burden, I will give them some responsibility which after all they don't deserve.

95
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:10,314
If I tell, I will make myself a fool. All these thoughts are thoughts from a mind which is not healthy.

96
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:25,734
Because the natural is, if you have a problem to discuss the problem with the society.

97
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:36,164
 Homeopathy bases its power, in the power of confession.

98
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,734
Why I say that?

99
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:57,864
You will see that with Homeopathy you don't do anything else but make the organism, confess.

100
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:17,024
You force the organism to confess, to bring out, if it is possible to the skin, everything which is inside and it is diseased.

101
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:33,724
You give the homeopathic remedy and then the organism starts bringing out to the light, to the skin, the darkness which is inside.

102
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:46,764
The guilt, the sins, the whatever is inside as disease now, you bring it out with the correct remedy.

103
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:55,330
So either he wants or he does not want, you make the person confess.

104
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:07,004
As I said, symptoms are expressions of a diseased organism.

105
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:14,084
And you go there behind the organism and you push it more, out. You say, out.

106
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:23,484
Christ when he was saying, take the demons out.

107
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:48,774
The idea is before you reach that point where you have the problem of Caust., it would have been much better

108
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:58,574
to have talked over with your friends, mother, father, wife, children, whoever is near you.

109
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:12,394
And can give some support, even just as a release, even if they cannot give you some good advice

110
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:19,714
or give you the money which you owe, you just discuss.

111
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:33,624
In our societies we're getting sick because we hide, we keep secrets. Each one of us we're full of secrets.

112
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:43,604
I had a very interesting case in the previous seminar.

113
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:57,494
A little girl of 11-12, an Italian girl changed completely her character, why?

114
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:09,934
Because she did something and the brother said to her, well you have to do now this, this, this and that for me;

115
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:17,124
otherwise I will tell my mother and father what you did.

116
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:40,804
So she became from a very free, open girl, very secretive, very fearful, obeying totally her brother.

117
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:49,680
She started obeying totally her mother; her mother said what is wrong? Now she obeys everything I say.

118
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:58,350
She will go and do it and the child started to have delusions. She would see, with open eyes

119
00:24:58,426 --> 00:25:09,404
 she would see pictures, people coming to kill her. And they say this was because of a fall.

120
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:21,244
In the class we tried to analyze the case and it came out that this little child

121
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:35,284
she kissed a little boy in the country and the brother saw her kissing this other little boy.

122
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:49,474
He said, now I'm going to tell. She was so scared, she kept it inside and she was twisted so much that most probably

123
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:58,284
 the spine came to a position, where she would have constantly a pain in the left ovary.

124
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:11,044
A pain in the left ovary, limping, changing her character and she was totally afraid that she has made a big sin.

125
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:29,210
I said God, the power of the guilt!

126
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:50,804
 She could have grown up and become invalid, she could be crazy because of such secret, the fear that she would be exposed.

127
00:26:53,120 --> 00:27:02,624
Fortunately we found the remedy, I'll show the video later on, in later years we'll see the video. It was very interesting.

128
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:12,884
What I want to say is that these people come and they lose their father, nothing they keep it inside.

129
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:20,244
They lose their child, they lose their job and then paralysis.

130
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:29,840
And then they lose the voice or paralysis.

131
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:49,870
In labor we may have a delayed labor.

132
00:27:49,946 --> 00:27:59,660
- What was the question?
- Which are the symptoms of Caust. in labour?

133
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,690
What I would look for?

134
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:14,084
I would say that if this is a Caust. case,
 you may find that there is a delayed labor.

135
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:23,604
There is not enough contractions, a paralyzed uterus.

136
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:32,244
Was anybody in the seminar in Aedipsos?

137
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:55,444
You remember the birth of twins by one of my students in Athens? A lady doctor who was in her pregnancy

138
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:07,431
the last month and she gave birth in a little house, there was no hospital. She didn't go to the hospital.

139
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:19,054
In 10.30 there was a dilatation of the uterus quite strong.

140
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:31,364
We expected to deliver in 2 hours at the most.

141
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:44,134
10.30 in the morning and 12.30 nothing, 1.30 nothing. In the meantime one of the students of the class

142
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:54,724
who was a gynecologist or something like that, she went and prescribed for her.

143
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:07,904
On a very peculiar thing, she said I saw something in the leg and she gave Sepia, without me knowing.

144
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:24,114
And the labor was delayed and we reached 9.30 in the evening and the uterus has remained paralyzed like this.

145
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:37,364
Because Sepia collapses the uterus. So at that critical moment, the uterus was paralyzed and would not contract.

146
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:53,324
At 9.30 I said, we have to do something. I took her symptoms by that time.

147
00:30:53,400 --> 00:31:01,854
Fortunately Pulsatilla was apparent and I said, thank God in 1 hour she will deliver.

148
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:09,794
I gave Pulsatilla and in 10.30 exactly in 1 hour, she started delivering.

149
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:17,590
But what I want to say is the power of the remedies and how they act.

150
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:32,814
Sepia totally paralyses the uterus and we know the uterus prolapses in Sepia.  It's paralyzed, it collapses.

151
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:40,404
Sometimes you will see the uterus on the vagina coming out.

152
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:49,724
In cases, in old women or in typical Sepia who have stayed for many, many years.

153
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:56,990
A similar situation you may see in Caust.

154
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:09,654
Not prolapse, paralysis.

155
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:27,720
If the uterus is paralyzed, Caust. may help.

156
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:44,234
It was a terrible experience because one of the twins came out and the other was coming in a breech presentation.

157
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:55,154
And we did not have anything; it was just a room, we had no surgery in there. It was 11 o'clock in the night

158
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:05,054
no helicopter, nothing, no surgery and the child would not come out.

159
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:17,234
We sweat, the story is too dramatic. Traumatic!

160
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:30,204
But fortunately there was a German gynecologist who did the manipulation. He had learned the manipulation

161
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:39,084
 because he had worked in Africa. He had learned to manipulate and slowly, slowly but in the meantime

162
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:48,854
we thought the child was dead, after half an hour, he says it's not possible. The child is finished.

163
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:54,164
In the meantime I was giving remedies because she was fainting from pain, the woman was fainting from pain

164
00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:02,964
 and I would give medicine to bring her back. Because he said, she must push, it cannot come out. Stay alive, don't faint.

165
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:19,974
Give the remedy, sweat, the other one was trying to get it out and I was reporting to the class the whole incident.

166
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:50,374
Terrible but I never felt I was failed by the remedies. I was not let down !

167
00:34:53,440 --> 00:35:01,684
One way or another, whenever I found myself to such a very difficult situation. This was very close because

168
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:10,364
he said to me, we have to cut the child, we have to cut it to bring it out in pieces.

169
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:19,544
Because if the child is dead inside, the uterus cannot bring it out. Forget it, it will not come out.

170
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:31,294
And I was thinking all the time while I was holding her, giving remedies, thinking what shall we do in case this is a fact.

171
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:47,064
The child was blue when it came out and we gave several remedies. We gave Laurocerasus

172
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:54,994
we gave to her Cuprum, Carbo vegetabilis again Cuprum, Carbo animalis.

173
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:06,534
Because the moment she was trying to push, she had cramps in the legs, screaming I have cramps

174
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:19,574
Cuprum to release the cramps. She was fainting, bring Carb-v, it was terrible.

175
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:26,500
Really an experience.

176
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:37,950
 With the gynecologist we became friends forever after this. We felt very close.

177
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:48,720
He said, let's go for some wine. And the woman, once it was finished, she didn't understand anything.

178
00:36:48,796 --> 00:36:55,644
She would say 'Oh my girl, I don't want to lose my girl'.

179
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:02,264
And I knew the girl was gone, what about her? Whether we would save her.

180
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:14,934
Once she was delivered and she was alright, she said bring me some wine, bring me some food, ate very happily.

181
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:29,164
Because it was premature, I said, 'you have to go back next day'. 'No, no problem, we stay here, you give us some remedies'.

182
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:35,584
She stayed, finished the course and then she went back to Athens.

183
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:42,664
She had by that time 8 children.

184
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:54,220
And since then, she has another 5. She has 13.

185
00:38:00,043 --> 00:38:14,270
Crazy, I mean 13 children! She was screaming, my girl, my girl, she didn't want to lose this one; she would kill us.

186
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:24,054
She never understood, I never told her what happened through me, what was inside me.

187
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:40,024
And this stupid practitioner to give Sepia at this moment, for no reason. That is why I'm so severe;

188
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:49,394
when it comes to Homeopathy you better do it correctly.

189
00:38:50,800 --> 00:39:00,720
Because I know what it can do and what it can spoil. And it's a pity.

190
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:11,434
You will say, you never made a mistake? Of course I make mistakes but I'm careful at least that the mistakes

191
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:17,376
 will be the least possible and will do the least possible harm.

192
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:52,484
You don't have to remember very much of Chel. Chel. is a difficult remedy; we don't know the mental picture.

193
00:39:52,560 --> 00:40:03,914
As far as I have see in Chel. cases, the mental picture is one of a powerful individual, who

194
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:08,054
wants his opinion to be implemented.

195
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:16,640
An individual who will tell you what to do, how to do, the mothers.

196
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:31,004
 There is an expression which says, has a gall bladder. That means is a strong person, is it correct?

197
00:40:53,760 --> 00:41:05,844
-It has gall, it's different from having guts, it's a bit stronger.

198
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:21,864
-How do you spell it? Gall, you see it's the same, I'm telling you, it comes from gall bladder.

199
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:31,934
It comes from gall bladder, that person is strong, is ruthless, is powerful.

200
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:39,924
And somebody who wants to dominate others.

201
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:54,884
But this is not something on which you can really rely. What is the Chel. is a remedy that you will find in

202
00:41:54,940 --> 00:42:08,450
affections of the gallbladder when the pains are extending on the back. And especially on the lower angle of right scapula.

203
00:42:09,813 --> 00:42:20,044
This is very characteristic. The lower angle of the scapula.

204
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:43,924
It has some characteristic with another remedy we will see later on Lycopodium, which is desire for warm drinks.

205
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:58,004
Bry., Chel. and Lyc. desire warm drinks. They don't like cold drinks.

206
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:14,604
Aversion to cheese and sometimes the opposite, extreme desire for cheese.

207
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:34,364
People who cannot tolerate cheese, even the cheese in some mixture. They cannot tolerate.

208
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:41,724
They cannot tolerate to have cheese in the table. The smell. They have great aversion for cheese.

209
00:43:53,090 --> 00:44:00,830
Right sided, like the Lyc. complains.

210
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:16,124
Neuralgias right sided, trigeminal neuralgia or headache that affects the teeth.

211
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:21,230
They get a headache and the teeth are painful. Like Kreosotum.

212
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:30,100
Constipation.

213
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:41,844
You have the dryness of the mucus membranes of the colon and a constipation which is similar with this

214
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:48,470
 of Nux vomica. Little round balls.

215
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:17,204
- This constipation is with tenesmus like Nux-v?
- Not very much, like Nux Vomica.

216
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:45,240
It is dryness of the colon and the stool is dry and in small balls but difficult to come out. Not the  tenesmus of Nux-v.

217
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:52,490
I like the sea, I should be there fishing.

218
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:24,354
You can say that China officinalis is a touchy person. You understand this expression, touchy?

219
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:52,420
They are in a state of erethism, the nervous system is in a state of irritation.

220
00:46:57,730 --> 00:47:09,964
And they will react badly with the least offense.

221
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:24,724
Very touchy. It is interesting that China is aggravated by touch.

222
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:41,174
They have a headache and you touch the pain, they need hard pressure, then it is better.

223
00:47:41,250 --> 00:48:06,964
But with the touch, no. The same thing on the level of the emotions. A kind of irritation, a kind of excitability, nervous.

224
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:30,284
People who are debilitated because they have lost fluids in general from the body.

225
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:43,960
They have lost blood, a person who feels exhausted and at the same time irritable. And excited.

226
00:48:55,560 --> 00:49:11,664
People who will have great distention of the abdomen, very bloated like Lyc., Colch., like Carb-v.

227
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:34,684
But if the wind (gas) comes out, there is no relief. The same bloatness, the same irritability stays.

228
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:57,044
And the characteristic for these people is that they lie in bed in the night and they develop a great imagination.

229
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:02,004
They build castles in the air, as they call it.

230
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:14,764
They imagine, this nice feeling where they imagine themselves giving a lecture in a big hall and everybody

231
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:24,164
is listening and they give the lecture. They are orators, great orators and they live so much this

232
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:32,308
as if it is reality and people are applauding. They become the heros.

233
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:44,914
And then they go with another story in the night and then they go to sleep in the morning and they come to reality.

234
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:56,414
And the reality is totally different. They have to go at work from 8-2 o'clock.

235
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:32,564
You say something to them, just a little bit, they are totally offended, they go into pieces.

236
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,260
What other remedies are like this?

237
00:51:37,336 --> 00:51:47,760
 Natrum muriaticum or Nux vomica, very easily offended.

238
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:12,764
They exhibit also many times a great fear for animals. Which are the other remedies which they have fear for animals?

239
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:26,524
Stramonium yes, Tuberculinum, Belladonna. Hyoscyamus, no.

240
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:35,884
Out of the 3 remedies which are Hyoscyamus, Belladonna and Stramonium, Hyoscyamus is not afraid of animals;

241
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:40,260
Stramonium and Belladonna, these two.

242
00:52:48,720 --> 00:53:00,780
China is afraid of all animals; a cow, it will run. A sheep.

243
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:13,034
 But Tuberculinum is afraid particularly of cats.

244
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:24,534
If you see fear of cats, that is most probably Tuberculinum. Tuberculinum has fear and aversion to cats.

245
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:34,060
Don't touch cats. They feel the hair.

246
00:53:34,136 --> 00:53:42,324
Before the cat is there, the hair is here. They never touch but the hair is there.

247
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:47,654
They feel the hair. It's aversion and fear also.

248
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:56,644
Fear that they get the disease, they will eat the hair, they feel the hair is in their mouth already.

249
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:07,120
Cats and dogs, Stramonium has fear of dogs.

250
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:18,694
Also Tuberculinum of course is afraid of cats and dogs.

251
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:34,894
It is unbelievable. I had a secretary back in 1970. She came to my house and I had a little puppy inside a little box in the apartment.

252
00:54:34,970 --> 00:54:42,424
We're staying in an apartment. It was a little puppy like this in one box, staying there. My secretary comes

253
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:52,004
she had the key of my house, she opens the house and I hear her screaming. I came out and said, what is it?

254
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:57,244
'It's a dog!'.
But the dog cannot walk.

255
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:08,874
She says, it doesn't matter. It does not walk, in order to bite you at least it has to walk.

256
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:21,884
The fear is irrational. Because some people they say, 'are you afraid of dogs?'. 'Yes' and you examine and they say

257
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:30,484
'if there is a big shepherd and I go through and suddenly he comes up to me, I'm afraid'.

258
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:39,534
Of course, who is not afraid of that? This is not fear of dogs. You don't take it as a symptom.

259
00:55:41,100 --> 00:56:06,604
But cats are not known to attack but dogs can attack. Very seldom if a cat is of a special breed, they may scratch.

260
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:23,884
But in the Tuberculinum does not matter. The cat is coming near, forget it they will run.

261
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:44,920
Fear of insects like wasps, Abelmoschus and Hepar Sulphur esp. wasps.

262
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:58,694
If there is somebody who is really terrified from the wasp, that is most probably a Hep. case.

263
00:56:58,770 --> 00:57:03,530
 The sting, they are terrified.

264
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:22,354
China is afraid of all animals. Calc-s is one of the remedies afraid of birds, Ignatia also.

265
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:28,960
It's strange that somebody will be afraid of little bird.

266
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:36,884
-I don't really understand the irritability, how do they react, they are crying or do they get mad?

267
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,144
-Who, China?
-Yes.

268
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:47,564
-China they will not have the possibility to cry. They just run away from any animal.

269
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:53,314
-No, like when you offend them, you hurt their feelings, their irritability?

270
00:57:53,390 --> 00:58:02,300
-Irritability, not crying.

271
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:12,964
-If you speak of Tuberculinum of having so much fear of dogs, how many percentage of the cases?

272
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:17,724
-Fear of cats or fear of dogs?
-10%, 15%?

273
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:25,584
-No, much more 40% my experience.

274
00:58:32,190 --> 00:58:36,780
More perhaps 50, 60 I cannot say exactly. But it's quite a lot, not only 10%.

275
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:49,734
-Hepar is not in the Repertory by the rubric 'fear of insects'. Shall we add it?

276
00:58:53,420 --> 00:59:14,974
-It's not? Fear of wasps, that means something that can sting them, bees, wasps or insects that can sting, they are terrified.

277
00:59:16,540 --> 00:59:31,554
I have seen a man, 30 years old, he came to my house. He had AIDS and they had come from Europe to be treated by me.

278
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:43,564
My house is in the woods, in a wild place inside  there and of course the bees and the wasps were there.

279
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:58,324
So as we were talking, the bees came and then suddenly he started running but I did not understand what he was doing.

280
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:14,284
Going out of the house, I lost him finally. What happened? He said, the wasps. That kind of reaction. I said, Hepar sulphur.

281
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:24,354
This is a case of AIDS and I believe is 10 years now since I saw the boy and he is still alive.

282
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:42,954
By running away because of the wasps. I heard all the symptoms but I could not be sure. The moment I saw this reaction

283
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:53,204
 I was thinking of Hepar sulphur of course, but this confirmed it. These are the points where you really confirm.

284
01:00:53,280 --> 01:01:02,524
  You have this beautiful fear of animals. What animal? Dogs. It's not China.

285
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:13,164
It might be but if she tells you, 'all animals' most probably is China.

286
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:25,084
Little tricks and then after these tricks what you do? You start getting feedback and you learn, you observe,

287
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:37,994
 what kind of a person she was. What changes? That's how you learn more and more and you go deeper into the case.

288
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:53,844
But what I'm teaching you are the basics which will make you good prescribers. After that you can learn more and more by feedback.

289
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:58,810
-I would like to ask whether Hepar Sulphur is afraid of injections?

290
01:01:58,886 --> 01:02:14,400
-Yes sure, very much. Fear of injections Hepar sulphur, anything that will sting.
