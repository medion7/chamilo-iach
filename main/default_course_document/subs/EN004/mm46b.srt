1
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:43,109
The main idea with Calad. is that we have over excitability, sexual excitability.

2
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:52,160
Easy sexual excitability but no potency.

3
00:00:53,090 --> 00:01:02,909
 Therefore it will be a good remedy for impotency.

4
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:10,399
One of the main remedies together with, which are the other remedies for impotency?

5
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:22,700
You just remember 3 remedies in the impotency. Calad. Lyc. and Staph.

6
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:29,979
Agn. also but very seldom an Agn. case.

7
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:36,569
Much more frequent will be Lyc., then Staph., then Calad.

8
00:01:46,560 --> 00:02:04,239
The history that you will hear is that young men, especially men, they have great desire for sex which also

9
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:19,689
 can go to sexual deviations. Because of over excitability, they can go to sexual deviations but at the same time

10
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:29,719
 there is sexual deviation and excitability,
and at the same time  you have a kind of impotency.

11
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,809
For instance, I will give you an example.

12
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:44,839
They are very excitable when they meet with a woman and they start having a sexual intercourse.

13
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:58,919
During this sexual intercourse, the penis relaxes and the interest goes, it just goes away.

14
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:18,419
That becomes usually a number one problem for this young man where the erection stops and  also the pleasure stops.

15
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:38,599
The characteristic is that, for instance if they try to masturbate, while they are doing it, before they have an orgasm

16
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:45,132
 in the middle of this masturbation process, the penis relaxes, they lose all the interest.

17
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:51,970
They become almost nervous wrecks.

18
00:03:53,700 --> 00:04:02,529
What they will do? The desire is so much and yet it's cut off.

19
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:16,519
-Smoking.
-Smoking? Actually the cases which I have seen are Greek cases and they all smoke.

20
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:41,189
I just want to give you the peculiarities and to see how you differentiate one remedy from another.

21
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:58,189
Because you have several remedies which they lose interest or the penis relaxes with the sexual act like Nux-v.

22
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:08,159
It is also over excitable, the moment they start coition, it is gone.

23
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:18,799
Calad. they continue and I have found out something very interesting, what they have described.

24
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:27,599
They try with mental power to keep the penis in erection.

25
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:45,190
They will try mentally to stay in erection where eventually the organism gives up and the erection goes.

26
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:55,579
But not in the beginning. The Arg-n. and the Nux-v. they lose erection immediately, once they start going.

27
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:02,789
Especially Nux-v., they start and with immediate starting, they lose erection.

28
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:14,629
With Calad. they will lose erection after some time and while they are feeling great pleasure and great excitability

29
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,559
 suddenly the whole thing collapses.

30
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:32,169
And then we have these cases in which we say that the people are suffering with mental depression, with impotency.

31
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:45,329
Impotency brings up a state of nervous depression and all this excitability that cannot find outlet

32
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:59,039
can bring the person in despair. And because they cannot have normal sex, they go to deviations

33
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:07,749
 and they say, 'let me try to see homosexuality,
 if that will make it more interesting'.

34
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:26,589
Eventually they may go into a kind of depression, where in the back of their mind is always the idea that

35
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:32,819
they cannot have normal sex and they can behave totally crazy.

36
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:43,399
They like a woman, they get excited and yet they are terrified to go to bed with her.

37
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:55,319
Because they feel, if I go to bed I lose face and I'll make a fool of myself.

38
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:13,969
Later on, they go to the state where they become indifferent towards sex and you will have men saying that

39
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:21,969
I have stopped even trying to have sex, since many years.

40
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:33,489
Yet the excitability and the desire becomes bigger. It's not that they lose the desire and they say

41
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:36,729
OK I lost the desire, forget it.

42
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:45,119
The desire remains, the impotency
 remains, they go into depression.

43
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:53,879
I remember cases where they said, for instance a young man after trying different kinds of sex

44
00:08:53,880 --> 00:09:07,369
homosexual, not homosexual, all kind of deviations he did not act normally in his function and decided sex

45
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:11,649
 is not good for me and he finished with sex.

46
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:27,599
So they come to us with digestive problems, with heart problems, with palpitation and they have forgotten about sex.

47
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:40,239
And you give them Calad. if you see that picture, how they came to that depression and they start getting interested in sex

48
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,039
and then they can perform.

49
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:58,480
There are some peculiarities also.

50
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:04,279
You will see here fear of cutting himself while shaving.

51
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:18,759
This you can say, it is a fear that everybody may have, no they don't. This is a strange fear because

52
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:26,129
they never cut themselves and every time
 they shave, they feel oh I may cut myself.

53
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:39,869
There is also an anxiety about their health which they will make them go to the doctor and attach themselves

54
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:46,839
 to the doctor because they feel more security by having a contact.

55
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:58,839
You will give Staph. usually because suppressed sex and impotency, you will give other remedies

56
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,119
 before you come down to Calad.

57
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:07,479
If you get this general idea, then you may catch the remedy.

58
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:14,999
Otherwise the fear of being cut in shaving you will find it but it is a rare symptom.

59
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,479
If you find it, it's great but it is a rare symptom.

60
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:43,119
When Kent describes Calad. he says, it belongs to people who have a lot of sexual activity

61
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,340
and then they become impotent.

62
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:55,519
They are totally impotent, you see the excitability that gives you the idea.

63
00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:07,379
They see a woman in the street, they observe her and with their fantasy they almost have sex with her and then

64
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:12,439
 they have an orgasm, without erection.

65
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:24,339
This is an extreme case, a little bit too extreme, Kent was describing because maybe he saw 1 or 2 cases like this.

66
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:35,719
It is not a state which you will really find in every case of Calad.

67
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:54,079
Today just watching a woman and having an orgasm is a very seldom phenomenon but the idea is that

68
00:12:54,610 --> 00:13:00,409
the excitability is much, where the potency is very low.

69
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:18,639
A woman also has the same problem, great excitability and during the intercourse, they lose interest.

70
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:33,879
It becomes almost impossible to continue with the sexual intercourse, they say please stop.

71
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:49,919
In the middle, where there was excitement, then suddenly you see the woman becomes totally disinterested

72
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,809
 and she cannot, she says stop please.

73
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:12,199
I know what you're thinking but it's wrong and then the man will ask why, what is happening and the woman

74
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:19,899
 is a nervous wreck because she knows
that happens again and again.

75
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:27,899
And she does not know why and you see the organism is depleted of energy.

76
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:34,120
It comes to the mental depression here.

77
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:45,999
This mental depression is accompanied
also by very weak memory.

78
00:14:48,190 --> 00:15:00,799
They have to write down everything that they have to do; otherwise they will forget very easily what they need to do.

79
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:25,119
It's a disturbance which affects all levels and usually they will not come for impotency.

80
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:35,629
I found out the Calad. cases, they have been doing this for years and they have decided or they have suppressed.

81
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:47,469
I remember another case, a young man said he was reprimanded so much in his young age for teasing the women

82
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:55,119
for doing things like that, for masturbation, they parents they have seen him.

83
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:03,279
They reprimanded him so much that he
 felt he should not do anything about it.

84
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:11,039
 When he was a little bit older he found
 out that he could not really perform.

85
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:20,109
Later on he decided this is not good for society so therefore forget about sex.

86
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:32,459
When he came to us he was a mental wreck with all kinds of fears, anxiety about health, they become

87
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,129
almost hypochondriacal.

88
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:43,879
Their memory is failing and everything is breaking down.

89
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:57,399
It's very interesting to see the reappearance of the sexual function, how it comes under Calad.

90
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:12,209
Together with the failing of the memory, together with the mental depression, we usually have sleeplessness.

91
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:30,959
And the sleeplessness is of the type that they are afraid to go into sleep. They remain awake for long period of time.

92
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:42,079
And if they do go to sleep, after a few hours, they're getting up. They don't have enough sleep to recover.

93
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:53,999
Characteristic is that they're bothered by flies. If there are flies in the room, they will always go to the Calad.

94
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:09,279
The reason is that they have sweat which is sweet, sweat with most probably a lot of sugar inside

95
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:19,639
that's why it says Calad. is bothered by flies. And if you ask, they will never say it as a symptom but if you ask

96
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:27,920
they will say yes, it's very strange all the flies will come to me. It's because the sweat is sweet.

97
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:37,370
Sensation of something crawling or an insect in the face.

98
00:18:50,940 --> 00:19:01,759
Calad. also will be indicated in eruptions around the genitalia, like the Anac.

99
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,920
They have coldness of single parts of the body.

100
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:27,309
Eruptions around the genitalia, eruptions
 in the vagina itching within the vagina

101
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:37,659
 which brings also a feeling
of voluptuous scratching.

102
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:54,799
Also these organisms are affected a lot by smoking. Smoking is like poison for them.

103
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:05,290
It's not that they have an aversion.

104
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:14,569
Ignatia has an aversion to smoking. If they smell a little bit, they cannot. Spig. also.

105
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:24,599
They are affected by smoking, they become worse by smoking. Smoking aggravates them.

106
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:42,089
That is the reason for instance that sometimes they say, give Calad. so they can stop smoking. This is a proving of Calad.

107
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:51,579
You understand? They found out that if you give constantly Calad. 30, every day, eventually the organism makes

108
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:59,369
 a proving and smoking makes the person
feel bad and eventually they drop smoking.

109
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:12,439
That's nonsense because it is not a curative action, it is superficial; the moment you stop taking Calad.

110
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,479
then the craving for tobacco will come back.

111
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:25,599
During the course I will give you one or two cases of Calad. to see if you will recognize them.

112
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:36,809
I don't want to give it to you now because I give you the idea but this idea you have to recognize it within the context of a case.

113
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:46,789
Tongue swollen with an excess of saliva can
be of course a symptom of Merc. as well.

114
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:59,889
The Calad. people I have noticed that maybe they smoke but smoking makes so much worse their system.

115
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:08,519
Eventually they damage the bronchi and there is a burning sensation which stays there for years.

116
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:15,199
They stop smoking and yet this damage that was done stays for years.

117
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:39,739
With the sexual neurasthenia, with the mental depression, with the memory failing, with the insomnia

118
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,991
towards what pathology they will be going?

119
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:51,119
-Towards mental case.
-Yes but what kind?

120
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,369
-Towards arteriosclerosis in the brain.

121
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,599
-Also they can go towards Alzheimer's disease.

122
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:29,209
Do you have a theory of why Alzheimer's is so much an epidemic today?

123
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:41,759
There are so many cases of Alzheimer's today, they are talking about hundreds of thousands of cases.

124
00:23:47,170 --> 00:24:00,510
People who can live for many many years, they don't die and they count them on the life expectancy level.

125
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:14,799
-Because mostly the physical symptoms are treated but not the emotional and the mental sphere

126
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,399
and somehow our soul is starving.

127
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:24,119
It does not get enough food and so this is expressed on the mental sphere.

128
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:34,479
-I feel that the problem of Alzheimer's is a very complicated one and it's a product or a by product

129
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:47,399
of the way we live, the anxieties in which we are living the insecurities plus the medications that we are receiving.

130
00:24:48,590 --> 00:25:07,410
And the whole race actually is pushed in this way towards a condition in which the mental is totally destroyed.

131
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:20,399
And they come to us and they say, can you cure Alzheimer's? It's not a matter of Homeopathy curing Alzheimer's.

132
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,519
It's a matter of the whole society, changing course of actions.

133
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:35,419
So don't fall into such traps as answering such questions. Say no, who cures Alzheimer's? Give me somebody

134
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:39,759
 who cures Alzheimer's and then we also cure Alzheimer's.

135
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:58,779
But what we see with Homeopathy, there are certain types of people, one of which is Calad. that are going towards that state.

136
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:09,979
And with Calad. we can prevent or we can prolong the coming of Alzheimer's. That we  can do.

137
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:21,479
But once the problem is established, forget it. At least for the cases that I have tried to treat in Alzheimer's

138
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:27,679
I can only keep them on a level.

139
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:37,329
Then at a certain point you treat them for some time and they stay on the same level or a little bit better but they are not happy.

140
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:42,319
Then they try the other drugs and you see immediately they go down.

141
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:52,879
And all what they gained, is lost within months. All what they gained in 3 years of treatment, they lose in 1,2,3 months.

142
00:26:55,570 --> 00:27:06,359
So you see how difficult it is to measure things like that because they say OK, if we have given these drugs

143
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:10,279
 from the beginning, he might have been better.

144
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:16,919
So you can never win, you can never prove the efficacy of Homeopathy.

145
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:36,519
-The initial Calad. there seems to be a little difference between Sel. which also has reduced potency

146
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:42,930
 but excessive sexual desire, so what would differentiate if debility comes in both?

147
00:27:43,550 --> 00:28:01,399
-Sel. will not have that kind of sexual excitability. Sel. may have dribbling of the sperm, especially during stool

148
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:18,319
but not the real excitability.
These people are really sexual maniacs.

149
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:37,919
You have to have that element of sexual over excitability to prescribe Calad.  together with the impotency.

150
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:07,760
-Do you recommend to put it in the rubric 'sexual desire-easily excited'? It's not there.

151
00:29:07,761 --> 00:29:10,200
-Absolutely.

152
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:20,880
Very easily excited.

153
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:39,639
-A case of Calad. this was a woman, she was 43 years old and she had been treated for a period of 12 years

154
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:47,879
 with antimycotic medication for constant infection and itching of the vagina.

155
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:57,799
I was searching for the correct remedy for 3 years, I didn't find it and only because of her husband I finally found it.

156
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:06,519
He said, every time her belly or her abdomen gets cold, her feet cramp and I found this rubric and it only

157
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:10,529
contains two remedies; one of them is Calad.

158
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:26,039
This woman was very anxious about her health. for 12 years she had been living on a sugar-free diet and she always

159
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:31,459
complained of coldness of the abdomen but only of the abdomen.

160
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:47,279
I couldn't find out anything about her sexual life. The only thing I ever heard that came through her sister in law

161
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:52,009
and she had told her sister in law, I'm not going to tell them everything.

162
00:30:53,440 --> 00:31:06,999
-That's a good point because there is another point with Calad.  They are very shy talking about their sexual matters.

163
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:31,719
For instance, if one makes a remark to them that maybe you have homosexual tendencies, this is so hurting

164
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:43,929
so deep going because of his gesture or whatever a friend says, I think you have homosexual tendencies.

165
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:56,689
If you just do it like that in a Calad. case, it goes inside and they feel such shyness that they have described it

166
00:31:56,690 --> 00:32:04,279
 as if somebody is grinding on their soul or on their bones.

167
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:19,559
I feel such shyness inside and they will not talk about it. I have cases that they have taken years before they tell me

168
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,929
 and you give other remedies.

169
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:33,919
But the shyness element concerning sexual behavior is very great, it seems that they have   a guilt

170
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:37,679
 concerning their desires for sex.

171
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:50,999
You know the Americans call kinky sex,
they are the types that have these ideas.

172
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:09,039
Bomb them with a bomb of Calad. so they come back to normal.

173
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:40,679
Also it's very interesting, we say that we have remedies that select an organ to do its action, like the liver or the lungs.

174
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:52,239
Here we have the sexual organs where the main impact is and it's very interesting that a little girl she develops worms there.

175
00:33:52,240 --> 00:34:02,729
That means there is already a weakness in the area. And the fungus infection.

176
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:08,079
There is a weakness in the area of such people.

177
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:23,079
And it will be interesting of course to get information like if he was insisting in this case, what type

178
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:27,279
 of sexual contacts she was doing?

179
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:36,729
He will have much more information about the type of sex, she was involved.

180
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:44,749
But it is interesting that again comes the shyness in talking about these things in this remedy.

181
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:51,639
Another remedy which is very shy?

182
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:22,279
Silica is a very shy remedy, they will not talk. Also Bar-c., they will not talk. Also Nat-m., they will not talk.

183
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,059
Especially about their sexual contact.

184
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:47,579
Nat-m. get excited for instance with saying obscene words during the sexual intercourse.

185
00:35:47,580 --> 00:36:05,669
That excites them tremendously the Nat-m., they will never tell you. They are very shy to discuss about these matters.

186
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:17,815
Platina on the other hand they can tell, Orig. they will tell you all kinds of things. Lyc. also.

187
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:29,879
Lyc. they speak easily about their sexual
conduct or misconduct or sexual problems.

188
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,010
Calad. is not one of them.

189
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:22,129
Caps. is a remedy that is a specific for inflammation of mastoid process. A specific.

190
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,240
The first remedy that you are thinking.

191
00:37:32,241 --> 00:37:41,719
 I have given it several times and only one time failed and I had to give  Aur. for that case.

192
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:52,839
 They will have an effect in mastoiditis in any case. Also if the person is fat and flabby like Calc.

193
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:15,039
And they're sentimental and emotional but more especially if they express this feeling of nostalgia for their old times

194
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:24,230
 where they lived, where the parents are, where the home is what we call in general homesickness.

195
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:40,239
Fat, flabby and homesick and at the same
time if they are awkward in their behavior.

196
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:05,489
When we say homesickness is not the usual. Everybody from time to time may be homesick.

197
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:22,279
With Caps. it is a tremendous homesickness. They lose totally the present. They go into the past with a nostalgia

198
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:31,469
 which is so strong, so powerful
that almost it is as if this can kill them.

199
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:45,769
A nostalgia so strong that they feel they are melting away. Something intangible, something they cannot reach anymore.

200
00:39:53,400 --> 00:40:08,999
The mind goes back. They had a love affair and they have their youth and how they played, the mind goes back

201
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:24,249
and sticks there. There is a feeling that they think they are going to die. I can't stand that feeling, it's so strong, so powerful.

202
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:44,159
Out of the three remedies which they have strong homesickness, which is Caps., Carb-an. and Ph-ac.

203
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:52,449
out of the three remedies Caps.
is the one which is strongest.

204
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:09,879
It says with strong letters, sleeplessness from homesickness.

205
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:23,239
They lie in bed and this is a burning out of the organism.

206
00:41:38,640 --> 00:42:01,079
Tub. has a similar condition. Tub. will have a nostalgia and an impulse to leave the place and go to another place.

207
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:09,959
It's a similar situation but not exactly
because you can be confused.

208
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:21,519
Tub. of course will be rather slim, they are quite plump. Obesity is one of the main problems with Caps.

209
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:31,609
They have that same burning inside of the yearning of Tub.

210
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:40,639
They think they cannot live anymore. They lie in bed and all the time this feeling is so strong that they cannot go to sleep.

211
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:06,239
Of course this is another keynote, by coughing they feel pain in distant parts; they cough, they have a pain in the knee

212
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:11,309
or pain in the bladder or in the elbow.

213
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:24,199
This is a peculiar symptom in the way that he described coldness of the abdomen, at the same time cramps

214
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:32,090
on legs for Calad. It's a peculiar
 symptom which gives the remedy.

215
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:48,239
Desire for pepper is another strong symptom which also has it another remedy which has desire for pepper.

216
00:43:49,840 --> 00:44:03,639
Lac-c., they take red pepper and they can eat it. I asked a woman, I said no you will not eat this red pepper.

217
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,439
She said, give it to me.

218
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:21,119
We had her as a guest, she was taking the salt and putting a lot of salt. I said, do you like pepper? Yes. How much?

219
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:32,961
We had this little small red peppers that if you touch them, just touching them it burns the whole head.

220
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:41,079
She took the pepper, she started to eat.
 I said, oh my god. I know your remedy.

221
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:51,479
Little things like that. It has to be very strong. The desire is much and they can eat it, they can tolerate it.

222
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:08,199
-Whenever it says desire for pepper in the Repertory, it means chilli peppers or just normal black pepper?

223
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:17,359
-It means both, the burning mostly is the idea, that they need that stimulation of burning.

224
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:31,880
But honestly the eating of that is unbelievable.

225
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:49,599
-In Israel we can eat it. At least half the country is like that.

226
00:45:53,600 --> 00:46:00,229
-I will bring 7 peppers for the Israelis in here to see if anyone can eat this.

227
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:03,879
-We are in the other half.

228
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:13,729
-I make a test, a research project to see how many of the Israelis can take this red pepper I'm talking about.

229
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:23,519
Just eating this without even having any kind of lacrimation.

230
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:45,349
In India is different. In India is a culture since eons for this. They have the genes to assimilate that. India is different.

231
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:52,400
I'm talking about ordinary people like us.

232
00:46:52,401 --> 00:46:57,770
Who can eat chili pepper like this?

233
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:09,839
Thirsty after stool, also it's a peculiar keynote that you have to take into consideration.

234
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:33,349
Also the indolence in this case, the mind is really  flabby, the mind is not functioning and it's indolent, lazy.

235
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:45,119
They don't want to think. Caps. is not good for homeopathic study.

236
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:51,289
Because they have to be alert all the time and they cannot.

237
00:47:53,960 --> 00:48:03,859
I prescribed one of the first cases, when I returned back to Greece, I had some medical doctors working with me.

238
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:09,679
So one would come in the morning, the next in the afternoon, the third in the evening, they would stay with me

239
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:14,669
 and they would suppose to be learning Homeopathy.

240
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:20,769
I would tell the remedy, they would write the prescription, in the meantime learning Homeopathy.

241
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:39,639
One of them, plump one, after a few times he said, I leave you my prescription pad and you write the remedy.

242
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:48,399
He was coming to leave me the prescription pad and he was leaving. I could understand that it was too much

243
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:53,710
for him to watch what the patient was saying.

244
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:08,089
He was coming from Cyprus actually. He was living in Greece but coming originally from Cyprus.

245
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:16,769
One day as we talked because I wanted to see why he is doing that, he is not interested really?

246
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:22,760
Then we talked about and he said...

247
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:33,689
 'I'm always homesick for Cyprus. I live here in Greece but always I'm homesick for Cyprus'.

248
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:40,409
I saw his indolence, fat, flabby, I said give me your pad.

249
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:51,249
He was so well after that. For years he remained without any need in any other remedy.

250
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:57,720
Just little things like that but they go right to the essence.

251
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:05,709
 You don't need to remember too much. Just remember the crux.

252
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:15,239
-Mr. Vithoulkas may I ask a question regarding this feeling of homesickness with the old people?

253
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:32,599
I had a case of an old lady, 78 years old, she is quite fat, she was complaining about pains in her joints.

254
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:42,239
Burning pains and she is quite fastidious, so it was natural for me to prescribe Ars. But nothing happened.

255
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:50,192
At the same time she also told me that she used to have 6 big cups of coffee per day.

256
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:59,439
During this interview she was constantly talking about that life now is really bad and those time when it was

257
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:08,199
the old Russia, Soviet Union life was much better and since that time her husband died and the Perestroika

258
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:14,559
 and so on and she has no future, nothing good is going to happen in this country.

259
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:23,169
Could it be such cases of these old people who cannot adjust to the new environment in the country

260
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:28,679
when it changes and they always try to remember how good it was?

261
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:40,519
-I will tell you. Usually they have burning pains like the pepper, but may be other pains.

262
00:51:40,520 --> 00:52:00,269
But I will not think of Caps. in this case because the nostalgia is not a complaining.

263
00:52:00,270 --> 00:52:18,679
  A Caps. will not complain, life was better then. It is a feeling. There, my home and they remember, the love affair.

264
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:30,559
They almost killing the emotions, they cannot talk about it.

265
00:52:32,610 --> 00:52:41,509
This is a real problem you have in Russia because many people at this moment, as Russia has not found itself yet

266
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:48,519
 many people are feeling what the hell with all that capitalism, it was better with communism.

267
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:58,520
So it's not a matter of what I'm talking.
What I'm talking is a feeling.

268
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:08,709
 How can I describe this? It's very difficult
 to give you exactly the situation.

269
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:23,489
Like you have pain, so deep in your soul that you cannot anymore live with what you have been living with in the past.

270
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:34,930
It's not a despair, a sweet pain, longing.

271
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:49,819
Very sentimental but it can kill you.
It feels 'I can't stand it, I will die with that feeling'.

272
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:56,359
It is so strong, that is a Caps. situation.

273
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:15,199
I remember also from my experience, I had taken Caps. once and I felt that what others they were telling me, I felt it.

274
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:28,689
Suddenly I had that enormous nostalgia for the past. I'm somebody who forgets my past totally, back is finished

275
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:38,739
 I never think about it. Suddenly it came back all this. I said, my god I can't live with that feeling, it's so strong

276
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:41,549
 I'm going to die.

277
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:53,599
It was just for a few hours. It passed
 the next day. But it was fantastic!

278
00:54:54,630 --> 00:55:04,799
 Suddenly my past came.
 I could remember like a film.

279
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:13,319
I had forgotten all that and suddenly everything was coming back, an unbelievable nostalgia.

280
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:20,249
So when I see it, immediately I pick it up.

281
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:25,840
It's good also from time to time to try some remedies, if you have good health.
