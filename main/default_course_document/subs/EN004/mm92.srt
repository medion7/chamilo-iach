1
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:28,939
It is this degree of intensity which
becomes important eventually.

2
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:43,769
Because if the person will tell you, 'I can't stand drafts at all', your mind goes to which remedies?

3
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:57,339
-Kali-c.

4
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:00,559
-Lobelia.

5
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,520
-Hepar.

6
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,980
-Silica.

7
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:25,069
-There are 3 remedies which are quite
strong, Rhus-t., Calc-p. and Cimic.

8
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:34,599
If there is a draft affects them
 in the cervical region.

9
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,360
Calc-p., Rhus-t., and Cimic.

10
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:08,679
Therefore you have to be very careful because here you're going to do the most detailed examination.

11
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:30,439
The one who is affected by draft mostly in the lumbar region is not so much Cimic. it is Kali-c., it's Calc.

12
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:47,290
The Calc-p. is affected very
much in which kind of weather?

13
00:02:47,630 --> 00:03:01,559
 Just after the snow. This weather which
is wet and cold is a killing for Calc-p.

14
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:16,559
There are a lot of remedies which are affected by wet and cold. One main remedy is Dulc., correct.

15
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:24,319
But Dulc. how mostly will be affected?

16
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,039
Where in the body?

17
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,770
-Knee joints.

18
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:58,669
-In the joints yes, the pains in the
joints will increase. What else?

19
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:17,760
You will see that also it can affect the colon,
the guts and you may have diarrheas.

20
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:30,710
So exposing especially the feet cold and wet and getting diarrheas, the remedy is not Rhus-t. anymore.

21
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:36,080
It's not Calc., it's not Kali-c.

22
00:04:39,460 --> 00:05:00,480
But if the person says 'worse from
 drafts but I'm better from wet weather'?

23
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:22,889
Hep. and Kali-c. and Nux-v.

24
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:39,940
Except of Caust. Caust. is better
 in wet weather. What he will say?

25
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,040
That he feels more energy and
 his pains in the joints are better.
