1
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:06,750
This is the remedy which I take every time I finish a seminar. 

2
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:13,389
After the seminar I have to take a dose of Stann. 

3
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:24,919
So you don't need anymore information,
 it's just pure and total exhaustion.

4
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:43,769
This is the idea with Stann.  especially if the exhaustion is connected with some respiratory and bronchial, lung problems.

5
00:01:45,110 --> 00:02:03,079
It has a tuberculinic background. Tuberculinic people you know how they look, white and rather yellowish-white.

6
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:20,719
And always with problems with the respiratory. And then when they come to the point of having dyspnea or asthma

7
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,579
 the asthma is really exhausting.

8
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:31,619
They can hardly move and they go out of breath.

9
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:43,689
They can only lie down, not moving at all in order to survive. They move a little bit and then the dyspnea comes.

10
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:55,679
This is the number one remedy for
 this and the number two remedy is Bry.

11
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:06,160
Number 1 is Stann. for asthma worse with any kind of effort.

12
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:18,641
 But this remedy also has a tremendous weakness it's out of proportion, when he talks.

13
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:31,079
When they try to talk, they are exhausted and the voice goes down and down. And they say, forget it I'll stop.

14
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:39,439
The fact of talking makes the Stann. 
extremely exhausted.

15
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:47,639
If you are in that state of exhaustion, 
who has been in that state?

16
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,050
Do you like to have company? 

17
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:08,770
You don't like to see anybody. This is the idea. 'Leave me alone'. 

18
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:16,079
But you see how difficult will be to differentiate this remedy from Bry.?

19
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:28,439
Both Stann. and Bry. do not want in their suffering to see people, to communicate, to give out energy.

20
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:39,599
Communicating means giving out energy. If I sit there and I just talk like robot, I can go on for years.

21
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,050
But if I give energy to what I say, I can do so much. 

22
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:53,879
Communicating means energy and Stann. does not have it and you can see it in all respect.

23
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,135
 In asthma also it is possible that you may 
get a dry cough, exhausting dry cough.

24
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:18,439
And at another stage you get thick expectoration and sometimes by coughing there are pieces which are flying 

25
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:26,079
out of the mouth. Pieces of mucus, like a jet.

26
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,250
I have never prescribed Stann. without exhaustion. 

27
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:52,199
Most probably Stann. might be indicated in some other condition but I have never prescribed it without the exhaustion. 

28
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,950
 Or if I have tried to, it didn't work. 

29
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:09,469
Concerning the digestive system and there we see the emptiness, the empty feeling in the stomach 

30
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:21,159
with a nausea that comes from smells, especially cooking.

31
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:39,359
You may see prolapse of the uterus but this you will never prescribe in prolapse of the uterus Stann. 

32
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,899
unless you have the general picture of exhaustion.

33
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:52,719
There are some remedies which react different when they are exhausted.

34
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,760
Sepia will be what? 

35
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:11,920
When exhausted, Sepia will become irritable.

36
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:34,719
 For instance get Nux-v. down, exhausted and the moment you say one more word, explodes.

37
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:47,760
That means there is left inside some energy
 and there is a protection from the organism.

38
00:07:47,761 --> 00:07:52,439
 It says don't give me anymore stress.

39
00:07:52,440 --> 00:08:04,319
With this remedy, there is nothing left. And 
when you push, the Stann. just wants to cry.

40
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:15,019
There is no reaction, there is no protection anymore. It is a remedy which is unprotected.

41
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:21,600
 It's finished, no energy to protect anymore.
 I just want to give you the intensity.

42
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:34,649
Because by comparing the remedies and comparing the intensity you can only come down to the right state.

43
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:44,959
So with Stann. you have to have weakness during talking, it's a keynote.

44
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:54,550
Weakness on doing anything.

45
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:04,129
 The woman has to cook and she has to get up and go to the kitchen. By the time she goes to the kitchen, she is already tired.

46
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:13,919
And in the asthma conditions, it's a remedy that will not straight away cure asthma. You will give this remedy

47
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:21,180
as a first remedy, then it picks up the energy, then eventually you will get another remedy and perhaps a third one.

48
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:27,340
That means heavy asthmatic conditions, not simple.

49
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:38,299
And when you see the vitality of the person
 looks good, you will not think it needs Stann. 

50
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,729
In Stann. you see that exhaustion. It's there, you see it.

51
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:54,649
-May I ask one more question concerning the weakness? Mur-ac. also has such an extreme weakness.

52
00:09:54,650 --> 00:10:09,039
-Yes it has but Mur-ac. usually the weakness you will meet under fever. Under conditions which have inflammations.

53
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:23,680
One more thing that I forgot to mention here in Stann.  it is the position in which they sleep. I will show you the position.

54
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:30,460
It's very strange. They try to bring down the foot. 

55
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:53,249
They bring the knee on top. This is a very awkward position.

56
00:10:53,250 --> 00:11:01,919
There are some remedies which sleep like that.
 I have mentioned already Nux-v. I think.

57
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,559
-I sleep like this and my two daughters.

58
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:21,169
-Podo. sleeps like this. You take out the foot and they cannot go to sleep. This is a very awkward position.

59
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:26,040
 That's the only position they can sleep, Stann. 


60
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:35,399
They lie on the back but then they may turn. Once they turn it changes but lying on back always they bring

61
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:40,640
 the one foot, usually the right foot they bring it over.

62
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,129
-How does one recognize a tubercular diathesis?

63
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:21,999
-You will recognize the sensitivity on the lungs. The sputum which comes out profuse eventually

64
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:31,239
you will recognize it from the look. Why do we have connected it? 

65
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:39,999
We have connected Stann. with tuberculus diathesis because we have seen in the past of such people 

66
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:48,999
either themselves having tuberculosis or their parents. And that's why we have connected it. 

67
00:12:49,000 --> 00:13:00,739
You see in tuberculosis after years, the exhaustion continues, it reaches that state or during or after tuberculosis

68
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:10,399
 or when the parents had tuberculosis, the children get all these infections and eventually they end up in asthma.

69
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:18,869
You ask the father he says, yes I had tuberculosis. You see the exhaustion, OK.

70
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:38,999
Pic-ac. is another exhausted remedy. 
Have we done Ph-ac.?

71
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:47,289
What is the difference between Pic-ac.
 and Stann. and Ph-ac.?

72
00:13:50,190 --> 00:14:05,439
Exhaustion here in the head, in the brain is Pic-ac. mostly. Exhaustion here in the heart, Ph-ac. 

73
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:12,439
Exhaustion in the physical body, Stann. 

74
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:28,369
That means when you have an exhaustion and the seat of complain is on mental, I cannot think, my mind has stopped.

75
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:32,089
This is a Pic-ac. exhaustion.

76
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:47,619
An exhaustion which comes suddenly which is many times met in students, good students who study

77
00:14:47,620 --> 00:15:02,569
 study and they are approaching the examinations and suddenly a curtain falls.

78
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:14,219
It is unbelievable. It is a curtain, they go into paralytic state. They say, I will not go for examinations 

79
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:22,449
because they have studied and one day they try to pick up something, they read, nothing goes inside.

80
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:34,869
Total mental exhaustion. The brain does not function at all and this is a terrifying situation for the students.

81
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:43,379
And you give Pic-ac. and in few hours he picks up the book and can read again. It's fantastic.

82
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:49,119
Otherwise there is no way that they can go and take the examinations.

83
00:15:51,530 --> 00:16:01,879
So the exhaustion has some seat of action for these 3 remedies and the Pic-ac. will be exhausted 

84
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:14,169
physically, exhausted also in her emotions but primarily on the brain. Primarily on mental level. 

85
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:19,929
Where the Ph-ac.
 will be exhausted here as well.

86
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:30,589
Ph-ac. you go to the Repertory you see, forgets words, forgets what he is going to do, forgets names.

87
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:38,400
The memory of Ph-ac. is terrible. 

88
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:49,789
But the main exhaustion is on feelings.
 Feelings are finished, I have no feelings.

89
00:16:49,790 --> 00:17:03,800
And then the state in which they go it's apathy. I don't care.

90
00:17:03,801 --> 00:17:22,279
 Your house got fire, it doesn't mean anything. Your child is on fire, he doesn't move. 
The feelings are not there. 

91
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:33,009
When you don't have brain waves here, you have Pic-ac. When you don't have heart waves, not physical heart, feelings.

92
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:42,479
No feelings, it's electric line. And that is Stann. on the physical level.

93
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:01,239
-What's the difference between Pic-ac. and Kali-p.?

94
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:18,199
-Kali-p. is not near this state. Kali-p. is 
a remedy that you will give after exertion. 

95
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:25,420
You see sleeplessness, the sleep does
 not recover, wake up during the night.

96
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:34,880
They continue the effort and this comes slowly. Kali-p. will develop over a period of 5 years.

97
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:40,000
 This, Pic-ac. will develop over a period of 5 days.

98
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:48,429
 It's sudden. You will never see this picture in Kali-p., what I describe.

99
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:58,049
The problem is of course that in the books we have the same expression for different things.

100
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:08,289
But if you take the whole picture, it's totally different. What we talk here is the characteristic.

101
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:17,549
Maybe you will get a Pic-ac. who has fear of thunderstorms, we are not talking of this. We're talking about 

102
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:25,900
the very characteristics of the remedy so you know where your mind should go at the first place.

103
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:37,879
You get this information, your mind should go there. Pic-ac. will look also very much like Gels.

104
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,909
At certain points you cannot differentiate Gels. with Pic-ac. 

105
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:49,889
The reason is that both they give up,
 they don't want any mental challenge.

106
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:06,119
Another characteristic is this burning along the spine. This is also a beautiful symptom for Pic-ac. 

107
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,879
burning feeling all along the spine.

108
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:33,713
In the books they say, progressing from fatigue on motion to complete paralysis. Are you going to give in M.S., Pic-ac.? 

109
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,760
Almost never.

110
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:46,719
So it's a paralysis of the central
 nervous system and not the peripheral. 

111
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:58,299
When it comes to that, you will not recognize
 it. Unless you have the mental weakness.

112
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:09,359
They will be aggravated by the heat, by the motion all these 3 remedies are aggravated by exertion. 

113
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:20,789
Pic-ac. also will be aggravated by heat, by exertion. And what is the worse exertion?

114
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,599
It's mental, yes.

115
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:40,369
What is the worst exertion you can have in the shortest time?

116
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:56,029
Sexual intercourse, they are aggravated by sexual intercourse.

117
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:11,947
You are grown ups now. Even this little one who was here in the beginning, she has grown up.

118
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,640
So we can talk seriously about matters.

119
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:31,639
Pic-ac. can come from worries of the mind. Somebody worries, where shall I find the money, where shall I invest money?

120
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:45,209
And the mind becomes overworked but usually we see it when under stress and pressure you have to exercise

121
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:47,869
 the power of the mind.

122
00:22:49,220 --> 00:23:00,949
That is the time where the mind collapses. If you give Pic-ac. before that...the person says, 'I'm exhausted'. 

123
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:12,789
And you ask, 'can you read?', 'Yes I can still 
read' and you give it, it will do nothing.

124
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:21,769
You have to have this curtain, it's like a curtain that goes down and nothing allows to come in.

125
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:32,049
-Do you remember we gave Pic-ac. to the Norwegian girl we had? I was not here to know if Pic-ac. helped.

126
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,779
 I would like to know.

127
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:41,549
-There is a follow up.
-Can you give it if the exhaustion is already very long time?

128
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:54,389
-Yes, once you have that state. Because Pic-ac. may stay, once it comes, it may stay. It's not that it will come

129
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:58,639
 for two days and then it will go away.

130
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:05,969
Pic-ac. will come suddenly and it will stay.

131
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:36,879
That's another remedy which is similar to Stann. because it's a remedy that has sensitivities on the respiratory 

132
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:48,259
with aggravation from exhaustion. It's a very exhausted remedy. It's a remedy that you will need

133
00:24:48,260 --> 00:25:00,219
 in a flu situation, influenzas with fever, exhaustion, coughing, a deep cough.

134
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,530
It's like a saw. 

135
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,920
This heavy cough.

136
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:36,240
Many times you have a combination of respiratory problems together with heart.

137
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:52,149
They have an aggravation from cold and 
an amelioration from warmth in general. 

138
00:25:52,150 --> 00:26:07,889
Unlike other remedies which usually like to be up, the Spongia can lie almost flat in her back.

139
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:17,879
-Can I say something about Spongia? I had a patient who came to me with heart problems and coughing

140
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:24,899
 and many symptoms and I did not know what to give him. I was completely lost and then he said,

141
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:32,579
'I have terrible pains in my legs'. 'What kind of pain?' He said, 'it's like a sponge'

142
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:39,379
 and I gave Spongia 30 and all the symptoms ameliorated very much.

143
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:46,209
-You see in the books it says, when they breathe they feel they breathe through a sponge for instance.

144
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:49,129
 In the book you will see that.

145
00:26:49,130 --> 00:27:01,759
I have not heard that really but it's a good thing to know and this is something even more extreme. The pain is like a sponge

146
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:09,819
 I don't understand even what they say but what they feel and they say maybe it's something of value.

147
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:23,289
These remedies you will not perceive them easily in chronic cases, in chronic conditions and the only thing you see

148
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:32,629
 as I said, is the type of cough, the respiratory being affected and at the same time the heart being involved.

149
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:39,119
This combination brings the mind to Spongia.

150
00:27:49,680 --> 00:28:05,179
So Petr. is a remedy which primarily has dryness. It's a dry remedy on the surface.

151
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:23,339
What is the difference with Alum.? On the inside is lose. Petr. you will use it for strong diarrheas and persistent

152
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:31,480
 with dryness of the skin. Alum. you will use it for persistent constipation with dryness of the skin.

153
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:56,659
The dryness here on this remedy is much stronger and the idea is that it is so dry the skin, it looks like leather.

154
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:08,269
And cracks. Cracks are important for Petr. You will not get a case of Petr. with dryness of the skin simply. 

155
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:14,519
You have to have some cracks from a few cracks to a lot of cracks.

156
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:23,309
Painful cracks and that is the time when you think of Petr. 

157
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:43,999
Also in a stage of exhaustion, especially with constant diarrheas and by that time they feel they are going to die

158
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,989
 and they have to make their will.

159
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:50,490
In the same way as what? 

160
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:58,189
Which is the remedy which they feel they are going to die and they have to make their will?

161
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:02,109
-Arsenicum?
-No.

162
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:07,100
-Aconitum. 

163
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:14,679
The imminence of dying makes 
them feel that I have to do something.

164
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:31,470
 Here is a sudden idea, I'm going to die, without reason. They don't have cancer in the last stage. They have just diarrhea.

165
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:43,969
 In the same way that Acon. is not really in danger of his life but the feeling and the fear is tremendous.

166
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:55,079
Irritable after coition, it is because of the exhaustion.

167
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:09,759
This is again the feeling of either he, himself is double or somebody else is lying in bed, is a symptom 

168
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:15,970
which really exists and I have seen it a few times.

169
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:33,269
Another strong element of Petr. is the easy upset of the stomach. The digestive system easily gets upset 

170
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:44,559
and especially the stomach in movements. Whether he is travelling in a car where there are turns 

171
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:53,579
and he is sitting on the back seat, he has to vomit or whether he comes with the flying dolphin or the boat.

172
00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:02,050
They have to vomit, it's very strong. The sea sickness is very strong.

173
00:32:02,051 --> 00:32:12,819
 Another keynote is while they are having diarrheas at the same time they have excessive hunger.

174
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,640
 They want to eat. 

175
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:30,759
And they will remark it themselves. These are good keynotes to remember because once you will hear it

176
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,659
you pick it up immediately.

177
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,690
Who has seen a skin eruption of Petr.? 

178
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:56,829
-It's not that the skin eruption appears at the level of the mucus membranes going over onto the skin.

179
00:32:56,830 --> 00:33:08,969
 It's they come really on the skin and they are extremely dry and the skin has cracks and it's coming up in winter.

180
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:19,230
And the patient says that in winter the skin gets extremely dry. 

181
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:38,260
And it's not like Graph. The skin is getting very thick.

182
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:51,199
-What you have to remember also it is that in many cases the psoriasis, for instance, which is with great cracks

183
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:59,339
you're treating a case of psoriasis with great cracks and you will see in summertime totally disappearing,

184
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:06,769
 this is characteristic of all psoriasis,
 but in Petr. is more characteristic.

185
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:15,039
In the summer it will disappear. In the winter it starts blown up and it starts September-October-November. 

186
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:22,759
By December it's full blown up and then 
it goes up to May and then it starts reducing.

187
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:32,760
Petr. of course is one of the main remedies for psoriasis with cracks.

188
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:40,300
And generally ailments which come in winter especially.

189
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:52,570
If people say, I suffer with diarrheas
 but in winter, that is a keynote for Petr.

190
00:34:52,571 --> 00:35:03,170
 I suffer with skin eruptions but in winter 
 immediately your mind should go there.

191
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,919
 Aggravation in winter.

192
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:18,679
-Can you differentiate the travel 
sickness of Petr. and Cocc. and Tab.?

193
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:34,319
-You will not be able by the symptom of sea sickness, all these three remedies have strong sea sickness. 

194
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:45,240
You will not be able to differentiate them. I've not known different sea sickness for different people. 

195
00:35:48,250 --> 00:36:03,239
All these remedies together with Sepia, Cocc., Tab., Petr. and Sep. they have strong nausea in the sea.

196
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:18,159
But also I have seen strong nausea which has never gone away with the remedy.

197
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:31,399
You give several remedies over the years and you see this sensitivity of the person to the sea sickness remains.

198
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:45,929
-I want to relate something. I had a gallbladder operation when I was 40 years old and after this operation 

199
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:55,039
diarrhea started and I had sometimes, 10 times watery stool, per day. It was totally painless, it was totally

200
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:04,959
 without odour and it was not exhausting. 
And a very strong aversion against fat. 

201
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:19,589
And they gave me Petr. C200 I had aggravation for 24 hours and after this it totally stopped.

202
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:29,449
-The aversion to fat also is strong symptom that you can notice together with Nat-m., Puls. and China.

203
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,799
-I had never had any dryness of skin, nothing.

204
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:41,950
-It was a superficial Petr. just on the surface.

205
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:55,669
But the diarrheas of Petr. can really be exhausting. It is constantly running water.

206
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:03,089
The diarrhea doesn't have a specific pain but it is profuse and exhausting.

207
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:11,180
And most probably you will see some dryness in the skin.

208
00:38:20,395 --> 00:38:26,919
-I wanted to say something as an answer for Richard's question about sea sickness. 

209
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:34,709
The last term we had finished here and 
we travelled together in the flying dolphin.

210
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:41,879
And I remember that I asked you which remedy should I take because I know myself I'm very sensitive 

211
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:49,559
and you said, try one of them, I don't know if it will work.

212
00:38:52,540 --> 00:39:02,040
And I had 3 from Ip., Cocc. and Tab., from each of them 3.

213
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:13,449
 I tried first Ip. and it worked for half-one hour. And then I had to take Cocc., it also worked and after this Tab.

214
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:20,259
they all 3 worked but I still remain sensitive to sea sickness.

215
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:25,499
-This is a good example.

216
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:36,019
-24 years back I came to Greece and I had to take the ship very far, from Athens to Mykonos. 

217
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:45,979
And I start getting a bit strange in my stomach and we were with many Greek women and they all took out

218
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:54,969
 the plastic bag for themselves and they started vomiting. I got on deck with fresh air and it stopped suddenly. 

219
00:39:54,970 --> 00:40:02,429
I did not have to vomit and I thought it is better with fresh air and I thought it is even a mental case. 

220
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:10,219
The idea that we now are in sea, we have to vomit.

221
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:23,869
-No, no, it's not exactly like that. All people they need fresh air, when they feel nauseous, the fresh air is good.

222
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:37,596
 Also if you have some natural perfume,
 like lemon and you smell, it may act.

223
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:54,039
But the moment the sea goes over up, forget the lemon, forget the breathing, forget the fresh air, the whole boat is down.

224
00:40:54,040 --> 00:41:08,839
I also had the experience one time, I resist, lemon, things like that and the sea was really rough 

225
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:16,739
and the plates were coming down and then finally I was also down there. 

226
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:22,370
And I could see a patient of mine with their daughter.  They were sitting nicely chatting.

227
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:30,012
And I was dying because you feel like your soul is coming out, now it's going to come out.

228
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:38,030
The sea was 10 Beaufort, very rough sea. 

229
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:55,629
I was in Skyros and I didn't like it and I wanted to come back to Alonissos and I tried to get into the boat 

230
00:41:55,630 --> 00:42:06,079
but the boat was full of cars of the army 
and I persuaded somebody, I don't remember how I did it

231
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:11,049
I persuaded somebody to let me go in,  and then I had it.

232
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:23,279
We were 4 people, my wife immediately fell down, I resisted and the other 2 people, our friends

233
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:29,529
 out of the whole boat, they said, I have no problem.

234
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:35,699
So it is a matter of degrees, who is more sensitive. 

235
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:38,759
You are less sensitive, you can manage, you go upstairs, you stay.

236
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:44,649
But the moment the sea becomes really rough, you are also going to come down.

237
00:42:48,170 --> 00:43:01,909
We go out with a boat to fish and the sea is rough and I have seen local people in little rough sea

238
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:08,649
 especially when the boat is standing, 
they get dizzy and they want to vomit.

239
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:23,029
-I know Petr. from only skin diseases and diarrheas but in which conditions would you see that delusion coming up?

240
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:27,279
Are they so sick in diarrhea that confusion is coming up?

241
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,799
-Usually during fevers.

242
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:53,050
It will say 'who is lying next to me?' 
and you will get the indication.
