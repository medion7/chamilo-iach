1
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:35,199
Well today I'm going to give you
only Materia Medica, no jokes.

2
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:47,779
I'd like to say a few things concerning the
type of Materia Medica which I'm giving.

3
00:00:49,070 --> 00:01:01,079
Many of you perhaps you have noticed that in certain remedies, I speak about two sides of a remedy.

4
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:11,004
Like in Lach. I have spoken about the loquacious Lach. and a Lach. type which is very reserved and will not speak very much.

5
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:38,559
About Lyc. I have talked about the permiscuous Lyc. and also the kind of hermit, a kind of spiritual person who becomes extremely moralistic and very strict, not having sex etc.

6
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,639
In Medorrhinum also two different types.

7
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:58,649
And it seems that there is a kind of polarity in the remedies. The information I'm giving you- and that is very important for me and for you I believe-

8
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:09,069
the information I'm giving you is the experience of my patients, that I have seen, treating thousands and thousands of cases.

9
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:18,729
It is not an intellectualization of the remedies.

10
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:32,239
 So in some cases where I have seen the different facet, I'm giving it to you, in other cases, in other remedies where I have not seen it, I'm not giving it.

11
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:44,249
I'm not giving you stories, I'm giving you facts that when you apply them, you will see they work and that is very important for Homeopathy.

12
00:02:52,950 --> 00:03:11,159
I have heard a story that medical doctors, quite a lot of them, say 30-40 medical doctors, they sat there for one day, discussing why Sep. has aversion to sex.

13
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:22,599
And they are spending the whole day, discussing why Sep. has aversion to sex. And they were intellectualizing attitudes and this and that.

14
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:30,939
Everybody came out with a total confusion concerning the aversion of sex of Sep.

15
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:36,620
It's very simple, Sep. will say
'I don't like to be touched'.

16
00:03:36,621 --> 00:03:50,399
You can talk about the intensity of the aversion to sex to Sep. and you may also connect it with the hormonal system but that's all.

17
00:03:50,400 --> 00:04:04,540
Once you characterize that and you say this is a strong aversion to sex, Sep. does not want to be touched, she likes her husband, she is OK with him, talking etc.

18
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:13,719
But as soon it comes to sex, that is the idea of sex, not touching Sep., aversion to be touched.

19
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:27,239
You can touch Sep. without having sex desire and she will not mind. Touch Sep. with sex desire and then she will react immediately.

20
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:33,749
It's a chemical reaction to Sep., she cannot
stand that, she cannot stand to have sex.

21
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:44,649
That's all. 5 minutes. What the hell they have been discussing for one whole day?

22
00:04:52,520 --> 00:05:06,369
The information I'm giving you is just my experience and not intellectualization things.

23
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:25,719
Another thing I want to show you. For instance, I've written Zincum maybe in the final form of what is going to be published, so I will give you an example how you will read and how I mean it.

24
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:40,079
It writes: the action of Zinc is primarily of the tissues of the nervous system, the central as well as the peripheral and also the meninges.

25
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:49,820
It seems to excite the nervous system and produce an irritation which initially manifests itself in a symptomatology of hyperactivity

26
00:05:49,821 --> 00:05:59,359
until eventually it reaches a state of complete prostration of dullness and finally of stupor and unconsciousness.

27
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:06,269
It is through the deficiency or excess of Zinc in the tissues that the symptoms are brought about.

28
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:15,169
The main idea is that there is an erethism  of the meninges and the nervous system which can manifest itself on different levels.

29
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:20,252
We have a prominent characteristic of Zinc which is in our books do not mention frequently.

30
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:26,689
A tremendous hyperactivity of the extremities, especially of the hands and legs.

31
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:30,869
In a grown-up this may often be caused by suppressed eruption.

32
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:50,600
He will show chorea like movements, though it's not chorea movements but appear predominantly when he makes an effort to talk or to listen.

33
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:55,772
When he tries to have a conversation, for instance, with another person.

34
00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:01,549
In that instant we will see a continuous
agitation of his hands and legs.

35
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:09,889
It can be explained as the result of an inner irritation of the nervous system which does not give the organism any chance to relax.

36
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:20,699
People affected on this particular level of the nervous system, which is mainly the spinal chord, will have an over active mind, being able to grasp and express ideas quite easily.

37
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:28,209
There is an abundance of ideas and so we see that we should not always expect the zinc person to be a dull minded person.

38
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:34,689
Once this erethism goes deeper, affecting areas of the brain, the person becomes disturbed on an emotional level.

39
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:45,607
He is constantly dissatisfied, nothing pleases him and he will reach a point where any noise and especially anybody talking in his presence will make him feel miserable and irritable.

40
00:07:45,707 --> 00:07:59,039
No wonder that such a person is complaining constantly and about everything. His health, his family affairs, his wife, the husband, the children etc.

41
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:06,869
Not only do these patients feel miserable themselves but they also become unbearable for everyone else.

42
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:13,889
They are not getting any sympathy since they torment everybody with their complains.

43
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:27,239
Their state of mind can become so chronic that it actually becomes one with their character and the way they used to be, may be forgotten completely.

44
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:35,119
Sometimes the erethism of the nervous system can reach a degree where it even produces fits of violent anger.

45
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:50,716
Eventually a breakdown of mental functions will ensue; the mind becomes dull and there we have the first keynote of Zinc, when we see this dullness accentuated, becoming worse by drinking even a small quantity of wine.

46
00:08:50,860 --> 00:09:00,544
The mind of the patient becomes slow, the thoughts start wandering or vanishing. His concentration becomes weaker and weaker.

47
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:18,639
Well this is what you are going to read. I just read you the beginning. I will not read the whole thing.

48
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,409
-Why not?

49
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,799
-It's boring.

50
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:33,609
-This is what you are going to read
and it's going to be boring.

51
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,420
And rightly so, why? Because you
 don't use your imagination.

52
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:49,039
I will say the same things now with
 my experience, what I have seen.

53
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,239
And you will see perhaps another way.

54
00:09:54,690 --> 00:10:01,519
I mean the remedy may become
 more vivid in front of you.

55
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:33,109
What I have noticed in Zinc is an irritation
 of the nervous system on all levels.

56
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:45,059
A stimulation of the brain that brings about a lot of ideas. A lot of ideas are coming and they are talked about.

57
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:59,019
And there is an irritation of the peripheral nervous system and then what you see is these ideas coming and then you will see the body starts moving.

58
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:08,629
You will see some cases where, when they talk,  they will move hands, feet, the whole body is in a constant motion.

59
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:19,809
The mind is in a constant irritation, in a constant erethism. Ideas are coming, they are expressed and the whole body keeps up with this pace of ideas.

60
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,519
It is a super irritation, super erethism of the nervous system.

61
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:40,429
This idea comes with Zinc. When we have the excess of Zinc appearing in the body and then eventually this irritation, these ideas will slow down

62
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:53,709
and will go to the other extreme, where there is dullness of mind and he tries to think and says, 'what I wanted to say?'

63
00:11:53,710 --> 00:12:02,299
And then another idea comes to the mind and then this idea is going away and then you are asking something.

64
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:12,700
Do you think that Zinc has a desire for milk?

65
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:18,370
'Do you think that Zinc has a desire for milk?
 No, no I don't think'

66
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:26,259
He has to repeat what he heard
to sit in his conscious mind.

67
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:36,759
The mind is so dull that he has to repeat the question in order to understand it himself.

68
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:49,389
From that over-irritation to this dullness, there
 is a kind of grades that will go through.

69
00:12:49,390 --> 00:13:01,549
And then the nervous system will follow and then the meninges will be affected and will be edematous and the pressure within the brain will ensue.

70
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:10,189
Then this erethism will reach such degrees
 that sometimes they will have to shriek.

71
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:33,529
It's a tremendous, a very aggressive, irritating and chilling shriek with the nervous system, that we shall see many times in children after they had a polio vaccination.

72
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:50,930
It seems that the reaction of the body creates an edema in the meninges, makes the child very restless in bed and in the night especially,

73
00:13:50,931 --> 00:14:02,899
while it's sleeping, will shriek in a way
 that is really frightening.

74
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:24,129
It's interesting here, I have the description of one of the doctors of the Center that had a case of that type.

75
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:47,349
She says, some relatives of mine came to my house with their child who was 4,5 months old and asked to be treated because the pediatrician had diagnosed a bronchopneumonia.

76
00:14:50,710 --> 00:15:07,209
Enquiring what was wrong with the child they told me that the fever was very high and the pediatrician had given antibiotics but they seem to have no effect.

77
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:22,990
They put the child on the sofa and the child had a look that was very penetrating, she could not sleep.

78
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:34,759
Constantly was moving its legs and especially the heel of the feet.

79
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:44,879
She says, not one moment this movement stopped. It was constant.

80
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:57,250
And the mother said that these motions are on
 a basis of 24 hours, the child never stops.

81
00:15:57,251 --> 00:16:11,479
The child from time to time, she says, 'it would shriek some terrible shrieks that I had never experienced before and neither I want to experience again.

82
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:21,420
It was like the shrieking of an animal.
It was chilling, you cannot imagine.

83
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:36,329
And as she was sitting there with open eyes, penetrating look, she would shriek, as if it was a shriek from a dog or from a wolf.

84
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,549
I got a fright.'

85
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:56,509
This is very descriptive of the shriek and of the irritation that the Zinc creates in a human body.

86
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:08,219
When you have a case of Zincum then,
you have to have that intensity.

87
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:16,439
Waking the child and.... this is not Zincum.

88
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:37,989
Now you know that the parents will tell you -and this is almost every time- the parents will tell you, it was chilling. You know chills on the spine because a chilling shriek you got really a fright.

89
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:52,499
So you see the irritation of the nervous system. Then you see the movements and then you see the movement in the leg, especially on the heel, day and night.

90
00:17:52,500 --> 00:18:01,579
Zinc is one of the most prominent remedies in restlessness of feet, when lying in bed, great restlessness of feet.

91
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:14,119
And with this irritation they go to bed and what happens? Big spasms, the whole night, the whole body goes like electric shocks.

92
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:23,281
The moment that they fall asleep o r while
they are asleep, Zinc is constantly pushing.

93
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:34,919
So they are from fibrilations, to twichings, to spasms, to convulsions, to jerkings, to unconsciousness.

94
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:50,409
When you have a Zinc case, you will have to have this erethism, this irritation, whether it's on the brain by these constant ideas coming over. Whether it is in the body, whether it is both.

95
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:57,399
 Then you have a Zinc case.

96
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:08,159
Once I was asked to treat a mathematician. He was a mathematician and I was asked to treat him for his heart problems.

97
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,919
He had some heart problems, I can't
remember now, it's about 20 years ago.

98
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:25,429
I was asked to treat him for his heart problems and he was a maniac, he was talking mathematics, he was like that constantly.

99
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:33,359
I said, what is your problem? 'My problem is,
the heart here, I don't feel well'.

100
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:46,089
Go and take this case, you see 'heart-arrhythmia' and try to find the remedy, forget it about the heart symptoms.

101
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:49,719
If you don't see that...

102
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:05,549
If I did not know Zinc, how
 would I have treated him?

103
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:14,809
Never with the physical symptoms
that he was describing to me.

104
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:28,709
My God what an irritation. A mathematician, he was very good mathematician of international repute.

105
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:53,629
You couldn't feel at ease at all. It was constant. I talked to him slowly, I talked suddenly, nothing. Every time he would give me an answer and he was moving up and down and ideas and mathematics...

106
00:20:55,620 --> 00:21:09,210
I prescribed Zincum 1M and within two months he brought out a big skin eruption, on the top of his head.

107
00:21:09,211 --> 00:21:22,089
Very ugly skin eruption of a gray, whitish color, dry, with scales, not discharging but very little.

108
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:31,309
He could not have remembered it but he said
 'it might be that I had it as a child'.

109
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:56,949
Now we must remember that when we have any kind of convulsions, fibrillations, twichings which have come about after suppressed eruptions, we have to think of Zincum.

110
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:08,329
Zincum seems to have a weak kind of defense mechanism. That is why it's so much irritate, so easily irritated.

111
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:24,960
It is a weakness of the nervous system that cannot balance, cannot keep grounded the person. It's either too fast or too slow.

112
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:38,189
Then when this reaches the emotional level, it is something that cannot be expressed emotionally.

113
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:47,679
So what cannot be expressed, it remains inside as a kind of dissatisfaction and always something is wrong with something.

114
00:22:47,680 --> 00:23:01,650
Zinc women especially that will go around complaining, complaining, and my child should be first in the class and now was second

115
00:23:01,651 --> 00:23:11,329
my husband should earn more money than he is earning, my other child should be going to the school when it's not....Everything!

116
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:24,909
The same thing with emotional level. And then in the book what you will see, in our Repertory it says, 'torments everyone with her complaints'.

117
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:35,039
Has anybody even seen the rubric?

118
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,937
OK by chance you may have seen it.
What does it mean in reality?

119
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:55,609
It means that kind of dissatisfaction, of constant ... 'why this, why that, I want this, I want that'... they cry.

120
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:02,549
The woman will cry. You will say
 this happens only in Greek.

121
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:09,220
Somebody came yesterday and told me the
 'the husband syndrome? Not here!'

122
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:31,680
I said OK, tomorrow I make a statistic. I will say, the husband syndrome never here and if nobody talks and everybody remain serious, I will accept what you said.

123
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,439
It may be less but it might be still here.

124
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:51,799
So this wife also that torments everybody is not in Greece only. It is a state of mind, you may be more controlled, you may be more disciplined, you may not show.

125
00:24:51,800 --> 00:25:00,519
I'm tormenting everybody with my complains, I'll try to keep on but inside the tendency is there.

126
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:14,519
So when you have your patient and then you ask, the idea will be there. The husband or the child or the daughter or some relative will tell you, yes this is what is happening.

127
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:26,989
They will tell you here, they will tell you even in Norway that this is the situation where they really torment everybody with their complain.

128
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:45,689
Considering the appearance of Zinc, they quite frequently will have a sickly appearance with withered face.

129
00:25:45,690 --> 00:26:01,489
I think Kent describes it well, he says 'emaciation of body, the skin looks withered, the face pale, wrinkled, unhealthy, sickly'.

130
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:18,279
The words he is using, maybe it appears to be repeating but it is exactly, the skin looks withered, the face palid, wrinkled, unhealthy, sickly.

131
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:42,169
You see the difference now? I just told you what I have been reading to you. But now you have another idea perhaps of what you will be reading.

132
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:51,259
If you read now, with this imagination, with this intensity, then you will have the real picture of Zincum.

133
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:59,749
Otherwise you'll say... the nervous system....
 all these nonsense.

134
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:17,069
Homeopathy is something alive. Something that unless you understand what is written in the books, in a vivid manner, you are not going to recognize it in the patient.

135
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:28,849
And it is mostly this information that gives you the possibility to discover a Zinc case. It is this idea.

136
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:59,469
He has to repeat the questions so that his mind can grasp their meaning. Apart from Zinc, this is also in what other remedies?

137
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:10,899
It is on another remedy which is
Causticum and sometimes Sulphur.

138
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:23,039
When we see this state of mind we also observe that the patient is making mistakes while speaking. He uses the wrong words.

139
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:35,629
His mind has become scattered and the conception of ideas is very difficult for him. It is difficult to reflect, to conceive.

140
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:45,189
One time the ideas were coming too fast, the other time is difficult to conceive ideas.

141
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:56,039
What are they talking about? And this is the time when they will be bothered very much when others are talking in front of them.

142
00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:03,769
There is a talk in front of them, they are people talking and they get irritable. They will leave the room.

143
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:14,129
Not in the beginning stages. In the beginning stages, they don't care. Whether you talk or you don't talk, they have their own ideas and they can be there writing, doing their job.

144
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:23,329
There is a lot of ideas, a lot of activity going
on in their mind and there is no problem.

145
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:38,409
Once the mind becomes slow, then that's why in the books we see, conversations aggravate him. The conversation is only a noise for him because it's so fast the ideas that he cannot perceive.

146
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:41,479
Once he cannot perceive the ideas, he cannot follow them up.

147
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:50,399
Once he cannot follow the ideas, then he is irritated because what he hears is just noise.

148
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:11,377
A patient who is suffering with Zinc symptomatology seems to have very weak defense mechanism, which is easily overthrown by any kind of suppression of discharges.

149
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:26,649
Suppression of menses can bring about a symptomatology, especially spasms (clonic, tonic) and fibrillations and jerkings.

150
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:43,839
And also can produce depression, sadness which will disappear if the menses reappear.

151
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:54,599
The menses can be 3 months late, 4 months late and the woman goes into a state of depression and dissatisfaction and does not know what is wrong with her.

152
00:30:54,760 --> 00:31:13,489
Then the menses reappear and the whole thing lifts up. We don't have this in other remedies. We have it in Lach. but in Lach. is before menses, pains, headaches, vertigos etc. come.

153
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:25,679
Once the flow starts, then we have the amelioration. The anxiety goes, the depression goes and the pain go. This is different.

154
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:36,359
Here we have delayed, suppressed menses and depression because of that. Menses are coming, depression is lifted.

155
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:50,269
Considering his state of mind and his difficulty in keeping up a conversation, it is easy to understand why the Zinc patient is sad and wants to be alone.

156
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:56,779
What I explained to you just now. They cannot follow the conversation, it is difficult for them.

157
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:03,049
The ideas are too fast. They just leave.
They want to be left alone.

158
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:07,319
It is the depression of his nervous
system which leads to this state.

159
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:14,529
One has to be careful not to confuse Zinc with Aurum in a case where the depression is ameliorated in the evening.

160
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:25,879
Here in Zinc, we have an amelioration in the evening. An amelioration of the general state
and in particular of the depression.

161
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:37,831
In Aurum we have the same thing.
It says, 'in the evening I am better'.

162
00:32:37,931 --> 00:32:46,419
So there is depression, there is sadness, there is the idea of committing suicide because of this dissatisfaction and life is not interesting, is not joyful.

163
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:54,509
The idea of committing suicide is there and then they meditate upon committing suicide.

164
00:32:54,510 --> 00:33:03,530
And once they reach the idea of really doing it, it is a reverse process which happens with Zinc.

165
00:33:03,531 --> 00:33:18,810
They feel unable to carry on their decision, they are afraid, 'death!', now they are faced with the idea of death. And a peculiar calmness comes on that moment.

166
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:27,985
They meditate on death, they want to commit suicide but once they reach the point where they feel almost ready to commit suicide, then a calmness comes.

167
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:51,759
This is a keynote for Zincum which is very different from Aurum because we have said in Aurum, when they meditate on death, Aurum cases, they feel almost relieved.

168
00:33:51,760 --> 00:34:01,769
Almost relieved not emotionally but in their
 own minds, they say this is a possibility.

169
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:09,879
Now I have the possibility at any moment to commit suicide, to stop my life. They know they have that possibility.

170
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:25,109
'I can do whatever I like with my life. I have
the possibility to stop this suffering life'. That brings about a state of relief.

171
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:44,950
 In Zincum it is calmness, it is an emotional state that comes on. In Aurum it is a mental outlet because they know 'I can stop my suffering, ah it's OK, next time'.

172
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:56,029
And both they have amelioration in the evening. Both in the evening, their depression gets ameliorated.

173
00:34:56,030 --> 00:35:05,039
But the depression of Zinc and the depression of Aurum in spite of this coincidence, these similarities, has nothing to do the one with the other.

174
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:11,879
The depression of Aurum is a very serious situation, very great.

175
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:26,549
Nothing, no light at all and the idea of suicide is so strong and it comes from very deep. And they are not afraid to do it.

176
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:41,369
Zinc, the moment they think of... they say no. I don't have the courage to do it. It is inside a cowardice feeling, a state of weakness that they will not carry it on.

177
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:47,560
In Aurum it is the belief that they can
 do it and they will do it.

178
00:35:51,000 --> 00:36:02,769
 Aurum meditates very logically 'this life has not any meaning for me anymore because I have lost...'

179
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:10,409
-actually they may have lost nothing, what they feel is- 'I have lost the possibility in my job to advance

180
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:19,539
people in my work don't anymore appreciate me. My wife does not appreciate me, my children do not need me anymore'.

181
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:33,199
Every department of their life, when they meditate it is a dark area. Therefore they meditate upon committing suicide for long period.

182
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:50,180
And when they find themselves in a high place, I have been described this by patients, several times, when they arrive to a high balcony with all this depression

183
00:36:50,181 --> 00:37:06,240
 with all this suffering they go through, it's a tremendous depression like a steel sitting on their chest. Something metallic, it's a terrible feeling.

184
00:37:06,241 --> 00:37:15,240
 They look down and they say, 'this is
 your chance now, jump'.

185
00:37:15,241 --> 00:37:21,600
 This is when they jump actually. That is why Aurum usually commits suicide by jumping from a high place.

186
00:37:21,601 --> 00:37:30,179
 It is the peculiarity of Aurum to have the impulse to commit suicide, when he is on a high place.

187
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:39,489
Outwardly they may appear to be similar in
their depression but there is no comparison.

188
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:49,739
For the one who knows, he will hear somebody telling his symptoms he will say no, no this is not Aurum or this is not Zinc. Wait a moment, be careful.

189
00:37:49,740 --> 00:38:02,989
We had once a girl of 18-20 years old, quite young, in an Aurum state. She really wanted to commit suicide.

190
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:16,379
We gave Aurum and I said to the doctor who was attending the case to advise her to lock the door inside the room.

191
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:31,079
To agree that for 2-3 days she will lock the room and stay in the room without the possibility of jumping and she stayed locked for two days.

192
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:47,759
During this, after taking the remedy, she said, 'constantly I was thinking of suicide. She was going to do it any moment and I would not like to take the remedy and jump'.

193
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:57,799
You understand what is the situation, so when you have that situation, put somebody to guard that patient fro 2-3 days before he goes out of the depression.

194
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:06,709
Don't tell 'take Aurum and go'. Because he may just take Aurum and jump at the same time.

195
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:17,999
You never know. You don't give time for the remedy to act. You have to protect your patient. So it is very important because you may lose a case like that.

196
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:48,389
Concerning now his sexual life, how do
you think that Zinc will behave?

197
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:55,649
-Strong desire.
-Very strong desire.

198
00:39:55,650 --> 00:40:16,579
It's the erethism which affects the sexual desire irritates, brings a desire which is very strong to the extend you may call it violent desire for sex.

199
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:40,199
If you go to the Repertory and you look, you will see 'sexual desire-increased': capital. 'Sexual desire-violent': capital. You will see Zinc is capital in all this.

200
00:40:40,200 --> 00:41:00,399
What happens is, he is so excited when he is with a woman that usually what happens is that because of over excitement, there is a very easy ejaculation.

201
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:20,379
It comes to orgasm too fast and therefore Zinc is one of the main remedies for easy ejaculation together with Lyc. and Graph., for different reasons.

202
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:48,629
But you will see the erethism, the easy excitement, excited easy, you will see it in capital. 'Desire violent': capital. Very strong for Zinc.

203
00:41:49,630 --> 00:42:08,639
And this desire usually remains when the mind is dull, the desire for sex still is quite strong and of course very easy orgasm.

204
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:29,179
So the erethism of the nervous system can appear as twitching all over the body and especially the extremities, as jerking, spasms, convulsions.

205
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:40,189
You will see this motion of the head which is characteristic also on another remedy.

206
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:48,359
Helleborus.

207
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:56,879
They had this rolling from one side to
the other and the hands are moving.

208
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:11,659
You see this erethism sometimes, I don't think you will see it here, I have seen it in India in a case of pinworms.

209
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:26,569
They have it a lot there, this child was full of pinworms and he was like that.

210
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:37,756
You will see this aggravation, I don't know physiologically how is the connection between pinworms and the nervous system.

211
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:45,299
But it is known that convulsions
can come about after pinworms.

212
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:57,369
You will not see actually this type of cases because you will get only in the hospital. But anyhow just as an information is interesting.

213
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:17,159
Chorea-like movements and these spasms
can reach a state of total unconsciousness.

214
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:27,559
You see it will be spasm like that and it will be unconscious the child or the grown-up.

215
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:47,950
The erethism can reach a state of violent delirium characterized by efforts of the patient to get away. He will try to get up and go away.

216
00:44:51,220 --> 00:45:03,059
He may become very agitated, very irritable, very angry and he may need restrain to keep him in bed.

217
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:15,849
In Zinc attention should be paid to the constant movement of the extremities, especially of the feet, when lying in bed and to the automatic movements of the head.

218
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:27,279
I will give you some little details because this is easy to remember now.

219
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:32,259
Now you know Zinc.

220
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:39,949
You will have headaches which are peculiar. What is the peculiarity?

221
00:45:43,170 --> 00:46:00,559
Occipital pains with a tendency to roll the head and at the same time you will see the same movements on the head, as you see in spasms.

222
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:12,370
He will roll the head like that and move
the hands, in strong headaches.

223
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:28,369
Another characteristic of the headaches is a headache with different degrees of temperature within the head.

224
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:34,970
The forehead can be cool and the
occiput can be warm.

225
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:46,271
And another characteristic of headaches, I'm giving you keynotes, is diarrhea during headache.

226
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:54,577
If every time he has headache, he says 'I have
 a diarrhea', then this becomes a keynote.

227
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:20,880
In the eyes you will see rolling of the eyes, movements like rolling in the eyes and also stitching pains in the inner canthi, here. Very intense.

228
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:33,759
Also an inflammation of the
conjunctiva during menses.

229
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:40,200
This can be seen also in Arsenicum.

230
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:47,359
And also you can see strabismus.

231
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:20,559
Cracks in the corners of the mouth with twitchings in the face and cracked corners, Zinc.

232
00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:28,080
They move their feet, they jerk, Zinc.

233
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:37,869
You will not get every time all the intensity I'm describing. You will get the idea, the erethism.

234
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:50,199
She can be moving the head and has these intense ideas but she will not tell you I have a lot of ideas.

235
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:58,799
You have to perceive that, you have
to see really what is happening.

236
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:07,649
Everybody likes to say he has a lot
of ideas but Zinc is really vivid.

237
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:33,069
And also in the mouth we have very easy looseness of teeth. The teeth become loose very easily and they fall off.

238
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:46,670
In the stomach we have gastritis
 which is aggravated by wine.

239
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:58,689
Wine aggravates the nervous system, little wine and then the stomach, little wine, great pains.

240
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:06,269
There is an indigestion and sour vomiting.

241
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:20,349
A feeling of emptiness in the stomach like Sulphur around 12 o'clock.

242
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:31,599
Also what aggravates the stomach is
 bread, milk and veal.

243
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:46,039
Vomiting occurs immediately after eating, in cases of gastritis, like which other remedy?

244
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:54,349
Like Ferrum Metallicum.

245
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:21,199
Colic pains immediately after eating, especially in the morning, breakfast and in the evening, dinner.

246
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:33,290
Also if you see an aggravation of his colic
pains, he says, 'don't talk, don't talk'.

247
00:51:33,291 --> 00:51:42,850
They feel more aggravated by talking, by noises, especially talking, human voices. Then it can be Zinc.

248
00:51:49,310 --> 00:52:08,510
In the urinary sphere we have the characteristic keynote, especially in prostate gland swollen, we have the keynote that he can pass urine only if he sits and leans back.

249
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:23,299
At the same time we have paralysis of the bladder with difficulty to void urine, to expel urine.

250
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:28,159
And many times involuntary urination.

251
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:40,259
We may have a hysterical almost paralysis of the bladder, especially in women and inability to urinate.

252
00:52:47,400 --> 00:53:02,929
Involuntary urination during convulsions and during coughing or sneezing  is also Zinc.

253
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:33,419
Zinc usually has constipation but if you find that the person has a normal stool and when he drinks wine, there it comes constipation, that's only Zinc.

254
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:15,289
Also talking about sex in women, we have great erethism, desire for frequent intercourse and, as a result, we may have almost nymphomania.

255
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:35,159
In the respiratory system we have a keynote, cough aggravated if he eats sweets, if he eats something sweet, the cough will be aggravated.

256
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:55,889
There is a characteristic of the back pains with Zinc. The worse position for Zinc is seating, for the back ache.

257
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:31,089
Spots of pain in the lower back also can
be characteristic, in the sacral region.

258
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:51,449
And also the pain in the cervical area that makes the head go backwards, it is a drawing backwards of the head. That is also characteristic.

259
00:55:57,790 --> 00:56:07,169
In the extremities, we have extreme weakness, trembling, twitching of muscles.

260
00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:24,899
At around 11 o'clock when he has this hungry feeling, his legs immediately become weak and trembling.

261
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:41,521
Or he may have a difficulty, a pianist playing the piano, when they experience sudden great weakness in playing the piano.

262
00:56:41,621 --> 00:56:46,900
That can be a characteristic of Zinc.

263
00:56:50,310 --> 00:57:02,829
Trembling of the extremities with fever in bed. You don't get this irritation but the whole legs are trembling with fever.

264
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:22,819
If you get pain in the heels after drinking wine, this is a keynote.

265
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:33,629
These things you will see once in your life. Some of these keynotes but when you get this, you remember it.

266
00:57:34,610 --> 00:57:47,179
The story I was going to tell you before the interval was how I started with Homeopathy.

267
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:57,895
I had an accident with my car and I didn't have anything to read. So I telephone a friend of mine, what was that black book of Homeopathy he was reading?

268
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:10,620
He said, Boericke's Materia Medica. I was in South Africa, I went down from another town to Johannesburg and I bought the book.

269
00:58:10,621 --> 00:58:18,619
And because I did not have a car, I got into the bus to go back home. In the bus I started reading the book.

270
00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:30,359
I read that book until Monday I had
read that book right through.

271
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:37,870
I don't think anybody has done that ever.
But it was so exciting for me.

272
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:43,903
It was revelation and a kind of a fever that
would not allow me to put down the book.

273
00:58:43,904 --> 00:58:52,660
I was reading the book. I read it in the bus, I read it in the house, I went to eat in the restaurant and read the book.

274
00:58:52,661 --> 00:58:59,989
And until Monday I'd finished the book where
 I returned back and bought more books.

275
00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:08,420
I've never regretted for reading that book because there are small remedies.

276
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:17,739
 Of course I read it again and again, later on but there are small remedies that you will need them once in your life time.

277
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:29,939
But if you don't have that anamnesis, that knowledge somewhere, something has stuck into your mind which was impressive about the small remedy and then you hear it from the patient.

278
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:36,189
And you say, wait a moment, you go back to your memory and say, I read it exactly as he said it.

279
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:43,890
And many times I have remembered the
remedy and I have done a beautiful cure.

280
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:58,639
Concerning little things I gave you about Zincum, maybe you will not find them in every Zincum case but if you remember you may be able to make a beautiful cure.

281
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:15,009
I think I have given you most of the
important things of Zincum.

282
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:31,999
Also another characteristic with extremities is extreme numbness of the extremities when lies in bed.

283
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:52,249
In sleep, as we said, we have a hyper activity and restlessness and shrieks of the type that we described.

284
01:00:54,250 --> 01:01:02,699
Many times they will wake up in a
frightened look in their eyes.

285
01:01:09,770 --> 01:01:25,289
In the skin we have eruptions which appear slowly. Again the weakness on the defense mechanism, they will not blow up.

286
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:34,980
Zincum eruptions are easily suppressed.

287
01:01:34,981 --> 01:01:44,770
If you see in the history a skin eruption that was suppressed within a day, with an ointment think of Zincum.

288
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:58,979
And we have convulsions in epidemic diseases which they suppose to break out with an eruption and the eruption does not come.

289
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:05,819
When you have convulsions because the eruption does not appear, think of Zinc.

290
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:15,099
In generalities, we have Zincum aggravated by cold and cold bathing.

291
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:32,189
Eating generally ameliorates and
tremendous weakness after a fit of anger.

292
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:40,600
As they are excited, they go into fits of anger where they shout, they express themselves very vividly

293
01:02:40,601 --> 01:02:47,000
and then there is a period of hours
 of great weakness.
