1
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,390
We'll be talking about Zinc today.

2
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:51,430
The action of Zincum is primarily upon the nervous system, the central and peripheral

3
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,350
and also on the meninges.

4
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:06,260
It seems to excite the nervous system and produce an irritation,

5
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:18,020
which initially manifests itself in a symptomatology of hyper-sensitivity, hyper-activity.

6
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:31,770
Hyper-activity, which eventually reaches a state of complete prostration in the physical body

7
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:39,620
and of dullness and stupor and even unconsciousness in the mental level.

8
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:52,770
It is still the deficiency or excess of Zinc in the tissues that symptoms are brought about.

9
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:02,260
Excess of Zinc within the body or deficiency.

10
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:28,690
We have a hyper-activity, especially of the extremities,

11
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,190
which seems to come from a kind of irritation of the meninges.

12
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:55,940
A hyper-activity that is sometimes so much prominent that the individual will act...

13
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,070
you get the impression from the individual whether he is talking

14
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:09,830
that his ideas are so fast and his body is moving all about

15
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:18,190
that there is constant motion and hyper-activity.

16
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,590
I cannot reproduce the state...

17
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:36,660
There is a constant motion of all the muscles of the body

18
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:43,910
that allows almost no relaxation at any moment.

19
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:52,010
There is such an irritation, especially when the mind is active, that the whole body is moving also.

20
00:03:54,510 --> 00:04:01,010
I don't know if you have come across the typical Zincum patient.

21
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:12,270
People that are active in their mind and they make grimaces, they make movement,

22
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:18,770
the hands are moving, the head is moving, everything is moving.

23
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:25,870
You get the idea that it is constant motion.

24
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:36,520
Now, this motion can be as I described or the motion can be motion in smaller muscles,

25
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:44,130
twitchings and quiverings of the muscles.

26
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:59,190
The initial level is that the mind is over active also and abundance of ideas are coming

27
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:07,760
with the Zinc and this over activity ends up finally into a dull state

28
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:17,620
or a prostration state that we see in Zincum many times or in Zinc picricum, more especially.

29
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:39,530
Once this disturbance goes deeper, on the emotional level,

30
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:51,010
then we see on the emotional side an individual who is constantly on a dissatisfied state,

31
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:54,110
constanly complaining.

32
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:09,440
Nothing pleases him and he will reach a point where any noise, especially people talking,

33
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:14,040
human voices will irritate him tremendously.

34
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:29,200
And he will feel miserable and he will start complaining, complaining...

35
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:36,840
They complain constantly about everything, about their own health, their family affairs,

36
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:42,950
their wives or the husbands, children etc.

37
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,680
Not only these patients feel miserable themselves

38
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:55,030
but they also become unbearable to everyone around.

39
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:08,670
They get no sympathy from anybody around because of tormenting everybody

40
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:25,020
with their complaints. They change their personality.

41
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:32,420
Once they are coming to a Zincum state, their character seems to change

42
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:41,680
and become a complaining person, all the time, that torments everybody with his complaints.

43
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:46,520
Why you did that and dissatisfaction...

44
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:53,520
People do not recognize them anymore. How did this person change?

45
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:05,920
Sometimes this erethism inside will reach such a high tension

46
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:18,030
that it will produce fits of anger, violent anger.

47
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:27,920
Eventually they will break down mental function will ensue their mind will become dull

48
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:42,990
and here we have the first keynote of Zinc, where we see that dullness is worse by drinking

49
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:47,680
even the smallest quantity of wine.

50
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:57,250
The mind of the patient becomes slow, his thoughts start to wandering,

51
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:03,840
he cannot concentrate his mind and sometimes vanishing.

52
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:12,990
This description will be good for what? For students.

53
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:19,330
Especially students who they have to use their mind in a very methodical way,

54
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:27,090
students of mathematics can become Zinc cases.

55
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:32,500
When they have thought a lot, it is all this activity which goes on and on and on

56
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:41,990
and then the mind eventually slows down, becomes dull and they cannot take anymore.

57
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:45,240
They try to concentrate and thoughts are flying away.

58
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:54,350
Their thoughts are vanishing, their mind is wandering all around, they are tired in their mind.

59
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:14,250
This weak state of mind will produce a peculiar state in the mind,

60
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:22,850
where the person in order to answer a question has to repeat it first.

61
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:27,080
This is very characteristic of Zincum.

62
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:40,930
If somebody, before answering a question, first repeats the question, then it becomes Zincum.

63
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:54,020
This symptom you will find also in Causticum and Sulphur.

64
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:19,010
When he is in that state, we observe also that the Zincum cases are making mistakes in speaking

65
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,200
or they use the wrong words.

66
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:37,750
As the mind is scattered all over the conception of ideas is difficult.

67
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:50,020
The confusion is mostly in the morning and, as we said before, after drinking wine.

68
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:04,160
The typical Zincum patient is a patient with a weak kind of defense mechanism,

69
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,830
which seems to be easily suppressed

70
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:20,420
and that is why we have convulsions, quivering, twitchings, after suppressed eruptions.

71
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:35,100
After suppression of menses we may have depression, sadness

72
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:51,260
and in the course of the day depression may come at noon or afternoon,

73
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:59,190
while in the evening hours Zinc is ameliorated.

74
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,870
Due to the fact that his mind is so slow, you also find

75
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:20,680
that the Zinc person wants to be by himself, he does not want to associate, he wants to be alone.

76
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:29,330
It is a kind of depression that leads him to isolation.

77
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:40,480
There is also another remedy which has depression,

78
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:44,410
which can be ameliorated in the evening,

79
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:51,150
which is the Aurum or it can be worse in the evening in the depression

80
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,990
and maybe also ameliorated in the evening, we can have both.

81
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:04,750
But Aurum usually has an amelioration of his general pains and state in the evening.

82
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:14,580
But in Aurum the depression is much deeper and much more serious.

83
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:26,730
The Aurum depression is an emotional state, the depression of Zinc is a mental state.

84
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:31,730
It is a tiredness from mental state that brings about depression.

85
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:39,320
The Aurum is a weak state of emotions.

86
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:56,080
The Aurum thinks that to get away from this life it's a relief.

87
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:01,090
The Zincum patient thinks that maybe it's good to commit suicide

88
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:05,840
but when really he is faced with the situation, he will never do it.

89
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:11,650
He is too coward to do it.

90
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:25,330
He does not have the nerve to really kill himself but the idea of death

91
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:34,140
with Zinc brings inside him finally a calmness.

92
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:45,580
It's a keynote for Zinc, when thinking about to die, there is a calmness that comes

93
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:59,940
and also he is too coward, he does not have the courage to do it, to commit suicide.

94
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:28,590
The irritation of the meninges will create especially in children a peculiar state

95
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:45,180
that is best depicted by the description of one of my students in Greece,

96
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:49,530
where she described a state...

97
00:16:51,770 --> 00:17:02,170
She said that she was visited in her place by some relatives, who brought their child,

98
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:11,920
four months old and were asking from her to treat the child

99
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:24,760
because the child was with bronchopneumonia and they wanted her to give it antibiotics.

100
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,510
The fever was very high.

101
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:43,000
The child had been given some antibiotics from another doctor but the fever did not drop

102
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:49,110
and she says they kept the child in the sofa

103
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:57,570
and the child had a peculiar penetrating look in his eyes.

104
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:02,680
A look, she says, that was terrifying to look and see.

105
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:12,990
The child, in spite of staying for a long time in the house, kept constantly awake.

106
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:32,010
He did not want to sleep and constantly he was moving his legs, especially the heels.

107
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:44,760
She says, not a minute stopped doing that, it was terrible.

108
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,920
The mother said that he is doing this motion 24 hours constantly,

109
00:18:55,020 --> 00:19:00,840
even when he was sleeping the motion was there, from the heels.

110
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:13,990
From time to time the child shouted some shouts that were penetrating and terrible.

111
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:16,980
She describes it, really terrible.

112
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:27,840
I've never heard, she says, such shrieking and I don't want to hear it again.

113
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:42,580
As if an animal like a wolf or a dog was shrieking, she says. It was bringing chills to me.

114
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:55,340
She says, as he was sitting there with his eyes like that, distended like that, he would...

115
00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:06,970
You understand the irritation inside in the meninges, the high fever and then this feeling

116
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:14,720
which I've been described many times, this feeling of chills that comes when you hear

117
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,580
that penetrating voice from these children.

118
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:26,990
It's a very good description, though it is in Greek, I try to translate it.

119
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:44,250
She says, I came out and I was afraid and she said what is that?

120
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:51,960
Actually I remember this conversation, she was telephoning me.

121
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:55,470
I made her to reproduce it later and write it down.

122
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:08,480
This is a typical Zinc case, she telephoned me and she gave Zinc 10M, I think.

123
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,700
Within two hours the child was calm, the fever was dropped.

124
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:22,810
At the same evening the child played nicely in the house before they went home with the Zinc 10M.

125
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:34,080
The child was OK, it stopped all this.

126
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:42,230
It started eating because he was not eating for a few days and he had become cachectic.

127
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:51,040
This is another idea of Zinc. They look quite cachectic.

128
00:21:51,140 --> 00:22:02,480
Do you know the word cachectic? Dried up, withered.

129
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:16,620
What happened is that the child after 20 days went back to her the SABIN repeated.

130
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:26,610
He had the first dose of SABIN before the incident and a repetition of SABIN,

131
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:30,880
the vaccination for poliomyelitis.

132
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:44,280
He had this vaccination 20 days after that incident and the mother telephoned again

133
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:49,030
to this doctor and she said that since two days after the vaccination,

134
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:56,210
the child was in the same condition, without fever now.

135
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:02,860
She asked whether did she take any other antibiotics or anything else,

136
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:17,280
she said nothing on the telephone and then 5-6 hours later she telephoned to tell

137
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:21,550
that the thing had started after the repetition of the SABIN.

138
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:32,950
She said I would never imagine that this was there and again Zinc

139
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:38,130
and the child was immediately calmed down.

140
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:59,780
This kind of erethism you will see many times after this vaccination for poliomyelitis

141
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:07,370
in the young children and when they will tell you about this shriek, especially in the night...

142
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:17,630
There is a shriek which usually it bring chills, something not human in that shriek.

143
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:29,800
So the erethism of the nervous system can appear as twitching all over the body

144
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,780
and especially in the extremities,

145
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:39,030
as jerkings, spasms, chronic or tonic convulsions.

146
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:45,530
Jerking is a great characteristic when they fall asleep, during sleep,

147
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:51,630
while falling asleep and during sleep, they will have great jerks.

148
00:24:55,890 --> 00:25:06,880
Chorea like movements. It's not actually chorea but it's like chorea.

149
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:15,130
The head will roll into the pillow.

150
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:30,520
Sometimes you will have consciousness and unconsciousness coming and going.

151
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:35,130
The child comes out of consciousness, then he subsides.

152
00:25:53,140 --> 00:26:03,380
They can reach a state of violent delirium, characterized by effort of the patient to get away.

153
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,880
He wants to get up and get away from his bed.

154
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:18,140
He may become so agitated and aggressive that he can be restraint only with great difficulty.

155
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,270
So in the Zinc suffers we have from the head various kinds of headaches,

156
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:50,540
especially headaches on occiput with the tendency to roll the head

157
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:58,300
and constant movements of the hands, of the upper extremities.

158
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:13,790
Also a characteristic is different temperature in front than in back.

159
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:19,290
Here, in front can be cold and here, it can be warm.

160
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:29,290
And diarrhea during headache is a keynote.

161
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:37,990
The other remedy that has that - diarrhea during headache - is Belladonna.

162
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:47,710
In the eyes we have convulsive movements and rolling of the eyes.

163
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:56,040
Stitching pains in the inner canthi.

164
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:02,510
It is one of the main remedies that has it. The only one that has it so strong.

165
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:16,250
And itching here in the inner canthi, which is aggravated by rubbing.

166
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:22,010
The more they rub, the more is aggravated.

167
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:33,900
Inflammation of the conjunctiva during menses is another keynote.

168
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,990
We see it also in Arsenicum.

169
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:49,740
Irritation on the conjunctiva, redness of the eye during menses and photophobia with strabismus.

170
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:01,250
The face of Zincum is pallid and wrinkled.

171
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:19,900
Kent writes emanciation throughout the body, the skin looks withered.

172
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:27,150
The face pallid, wrinkled, unhealthy. It's a very good description of the face.

173
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:37,650
Lot of wrinkles, unhealthy and in the history of the person moving, moving all about...

174
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:43,140
This kind of motion, moving all about and then in the history of the person a big eruption

175
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,210
that has been suppressed.

176
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:55,910
A lot of thinking, a lot of ideas all the time, mathematicians.

177
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:14,960
We have cracks in the corners of the mouth and twitchings in the face, a lot of twitchings.

178
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:19,720
This is the remedy, where somebody will tell you a lot of twitchings, a lot of jerkings,

179
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:24,560
a lot of this activity, your mind will not go to Agaricus.

180
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,960
It's another type, we'll describe Agaricus.

181
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:35,310
It's a lot of activity, in the nervous system an irritation, irritation...

182
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:41,470
That's how you have to imagine it. And then activity, activity, activity.

183
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:47,210
And then the mind slows down, it becomes dull and then if they drink a little bit of wine

184
00:30:47,310 --> 00:31:06,970
the mind more dull, they cannot think. Looseness of teeth another characteristic.

185
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:13,980
The teeth become very easily loose, they move.

186
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,980
All complains like stomach pains aggravated by a little bit of wine, think of Zinc.

187
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:44,740
It has an aversion to fish, it's not in our Repertories, aversion to sweets and wine

188
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:51,230
and desire for beer and cold drinks in the summer.

189
00:31:54,990 --> 00:32:01,570
Bread and milk can aggravate the stomach situation.

190
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:11,230
Vomiting immediately after eating or drinking, like Ferum.

191
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:35,070
Cramping pains in the abdomen aggravated by human voices, by people talking in the room.

192
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:53,310
They are irritated in their nervous system and they seem to take the impact in the ...

193
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:07,220
In the urinary sphere we have a keynote which is ...

194
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:17,060
they can pass urine only when sitting and leaning backwards

195
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:40,070
Sudden inability to urinate, especially in hysterical people.

196
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:52,310
Hysterical people that suddenly they cannot urinate and involuntary urination during convulsion.

197
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:59,150
Also when sneezing, coughing, laughing.

198
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:12,800
In the sexual sphere we have excessive erethisms very much irritation

199
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:25,540
they get very excited sexually and that is why we have the symptom of early, easy ejaculation,

200
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,390
premature ejaculation.

201
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:37,710
They get So much excited, so much involved emotionally that they have very easy ejaculation

202
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:52,080
like Lycopodium, like Graphites, Sulphur.

203
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:05,590
Also discharge of prostatic fluid during stool is a characteristic symptom.

204
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:25,550
In women we have again excessive sexual desire that can lead to nymphomania.

205
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:39,260
In the respiratory track we have the peculiarity, cough aggravating when eating sweets.

206
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:09,020
Zinc generally is aggravated by cold and cold bathing.

207
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:28,660
Ameliorated in general by eating and tremendous weakness after a fit of anger, irritability

208
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,590
and then exhaustion.

209
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:42,990
Great exhaustion after great expression of irritability. They have a fit of anger,

210
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:47,590
they express anger and then they have great exhaustion. General exhaustion.

211
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:56,080
There is hyperactivity in the sleep, sleeping restlessness and shrieking.

212
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:04,840
and a constant motion of the feet and jerking movements.

213
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,000
Tremendous restlessness of the feet.

214
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:34,570
The feet, as I described in the young child, all the great movements and twitchings are there,

215
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:41,080
it's an alive individual. We don't see anxieties, fears etc.

216
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:46,320
We see this great erethism and then we may see also the opposite state.

217
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:55,970
Great irritation, great emotionality and great depression, great ideas and great dullness,

218
00:37:56,210 --> 00:38:03,010
great sexuality and sometimes the opposite, impotency.

219
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:19,670
More or less this is what we have as characteristics of the Zinc case.

220
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:28,450
-What is the difference between the shriek of a Zincum and Apis?

221
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:46,980
-The only difference is that Zinc is much more found in children,

222
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:56,160
especially of today, where they have been vaccinated by the polio vaccination

223
00:38:56,260 --> 00:39:01,160
and after a few days they develop that. This is mostly Zincum.

224
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:04,910
I found that Zincum will calm down this symptom.

225
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:10,920
Apis is not like this, it's something...

226
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:16,500
Everytime they describe to me this shriek, there is this expression.

227
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:29,020
There is a chill. I cannot reproduce it because...

228
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:44,270
Apis can shout but it's more human.

229
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:54,400
You may be lucky to hear it once in your life because the parents will describe it to you

230
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:59,410
but when the parents will describe, they will describe this feeling of terror

231
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:02,920
that comes with the shriek.

232
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:18,880
-Are you often to prescribe Zincum as a constitutional remedy?

233
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:31,630
-Often no, not often. When you say often, you mean all the time, no, not often.

234
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:41,050
You have to give some Zincum, otherwise...

235
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:50,040
You see, unfortunately we have to know the remedy to use it once in a lifetime.

236
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:56,950
Sometimes you will use it only once but somewhere in the back of your mind

237
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:59,450
some information about that remedy must be there.

238
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:02,300
Zincum is not once in a lifetime.

239
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:13,800
Zincum cases you will be using - if you have a very busy practice - at least once in six months.

240
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:21,880
-Can you speak about the difference between Zincum and Tarentula?

241
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:29,660
-No, there is no comparison. Tarentula is another state altogether

242
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:35,360
we don't talk about this twitching, this irritation.

243
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:39,540
Everything is irritated. We don't talk about this with Tarentula.

244
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:49,030
Tarentula is mostly when we see the restlessness and the hurried feeling inside,

245
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:51,790
the hurried feeling of Tarentula.

246
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:59,460
It's not so much twitchings, convulsions like we have in Zincum.

247
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:04,960
Don't ask me questions of that type now.

248
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:21,860
Jerking in the night is a keynote, especially when you have...

249
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:28,560
Sometimes, if you don't prescribe it constitutionally, you will have somebody

250
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:40,360
who is very much irritated during the day, there is some kind of erethism.

251
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:47,350
And in the night they go to sleep, all the time jerking, jerking, jerking.

252
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:54,710
If that continues and establish itself as a pattern, then Zinc will take care.
