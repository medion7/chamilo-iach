1
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:31,019
We shall be talking now about Mag-m.

2
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:59,759
We can say again it's a liver remedy. It's a remedy that has as main characteristic, a kind of  temperament which we call sour.

3
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:15,539
This has been developed through years of liver and digestive system misfunctioning.

4
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:31,539
When we see that sour temperament with indigestion, we'll think of Mag-m.

5
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:38,630
Which other remedy can have that? It is Nux-v.

6
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:56,449
But Nux-v. is completely different as we shall see. These people have a kind of bitterness. They feel unhappy and quite tired.

7
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:13,059
Eventually they will reach a state of having an aversion to make an effort, an aversion to think and a state of mind which we call dullness of mind.

8
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:31,279
They are people that have this kind of bitterness inside but not the hardness or the thorny kind of bitterness that we see in Nux-v.

9
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:44,299
Nux-v will be aggressive, irritable and will have this bitterness irritable, aggressive. Mag-m.  is the opposite.

10
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:27,039
It belongs to people who have a kind of aversion to fighting and quarreling. Because of that, they cannot tolerate, they cannot stand too much quarreling and fighting and noises in their immediate environment.

11
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:39,459
It will be the people that will seek actually to pacify everybody around them; they are the pacifists.

12
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:55,969
Which is quite opposite with Nux-v. Again indigestion, a sour temperament in Nux-v but so much aggressiveness and so much anger, so much quarreling.

13
00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:18,889
With the least thing they will fly a temper and they will quarrel, they cannot control their temper. Mag-m. do not want that. There is fighting, they say calm down please, stop.

14
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:40,179
Mag-m. children that have already a dysfunctional liver, the digestive system is not doing well and the parents describe the children as very frightened when they hear the parents fighting.

15
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:49,199
And they want them to calm down, they say please mother, please father. These can be Mag-m. children.

16
00:04:53,430 --> 00:05:14,480
The Mag-m. patients are very sensitive to any kind of confrontation. Confrontation which involves either themselves directly or even to other people. They are very sensitive to this kind of vibrations.

17
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:33,439
They have a strong sense of duty. They are people that will do whatever is right to be done.

18
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:41,769
And they easily overload themselves with a lot of tasks and a lot of responsibilities.

19
00:05:47,050 --> 00:06:02,160
Then of course they come into a state of anxiety because they cannot deliver what they have promised, what they would like and have undertaken to deliver. And they come into a state of anxiety.

20
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:33,000
When they are in that state, they will have such great anxiety that they go into bed and they cannot sleep anymore. The same as Nux-v, sleeplessness but from too much thinking in Nux-v.

21
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:41,169
Here is the anxiety that they have not done, they have not delivered what they should have done.

22
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:58,419
This state, the sense of duty together with the emotional sensitivity to others, eventually leads to greater restlessness and fidgeting.

23
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:13,519
Over this restlessness, they become restless with fidgety and indigestion and they cannot sleep.

24
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:27,189
Some cases they cannot sleep the whole night; they will remain awake and they will sleep towards the morning.

25
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:44,319
And then when they will wake up, they will feel totally unrefreshed. It is a great characteristic of Mag-m. that when this anxiety state develops together with the dysfunction of the liver,

26
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:54,559
when they are go into bed even if they sleep the whole night, they wake up in the morning in such a state, that it's indescribable.

27
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:09,855
The body feels absolute heavy, they don't want to talk, they do not have the energy to talk. They feel completely stiff all over.

28
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:32,429
Mag-m. therefore becomes one of the main remedies which has unrefreshing sleep. You see when we go to our books and we see unrefreshing sleep it doesn't mean anything.

29
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:52,759
The way I describe it to you is that state that they will describe it to you, their waking state. Or if you go in the Repertory it will say in the morning aversion to talking, something like that. This state is the real state of Mag-m.

30
00:08:52,760 --> 00:09:14,540
 What is very interesting is that many times, with Mag-m. even with little ailments whether it is a flu or it is a common cold they may get into a very restless and anxious state on lying in bed and closing the eyes.

31
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:25,999
They feel very tired, Mag-m. very tired people. As we'll see it progresses that state of tiredness, it becomes more and more and we see another state that comes.

32
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:34,999
They are quite tired and they feel they must go to bed. They go to bed and they lie down and they close their eyes, these 3,4,5 minutes.

33
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:45,239
And they develop a state of anxiety. They are tired, they want to stay in bed, the state of anxiety comes and does not allow them.

34
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:55,899
And the restlessness and they turn around and they try to keep in bed and they cannot. Then eventually they have to jump up from bed and walk up and down to calm themselves down.

35
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:12,679
And it is phenomenal how much the symptoms which are appearing when they lie down and they have a common cold, the nostrils are blocked. And immediately comes dyspnea and dysphoria and they cannot breath,

36
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:29,830
 then the anxiety, the restlessness and then it is a syndrome all together which builds up while they are lying and having their eyes closed. They have to get up and walk up and down, up and down and then they are relieved.

37
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:46,679
That becomes characteristic of Mag-m. people but Mag-m. now breaks down the whole system. It makes the whole system feel tired and old.

38
00:10:48,650 --> 00:11:12,729
The tissues become dried up. There are rhagades, cracks in the corners. The skin becomes old looking from dried up situation.

39
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:28,559
And it's very characteristic with Mag-m. people that as they go through suffering in life and then eventually the liver starts breaking down, the digestive system is not working a lot

40
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:44,279
 more disappointments, more dysfunction of the liver, more waking up in the morning very tired, more constipation, more indigestion, they feel tired and more tired.

41
00:11:44,280 --> 00:12:04,220
And then one day they go to the mirror, they look in the mirror and they say, 'my God! I've become old suddenly' they realize. And the moment they look at the mirror they don't have the energy to liven up.

42
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:20,539
It seems there is a vicious circle. Looking at the mirror makes them feel more tired, more old and one of the main characteristics of Mag-m. you will see this tiredness, this indigestion, liver, the waking up in the morning.

43
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:36,249
Also they will say 'I've become old'. The feeling that they have become old, they look old and then eventually an unsocial feeling comes where they want to be by themselves.

44
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:47,569
They don't want company, they don't want to go out to the parties. The woman will say to her husband go by yourself, I'm too tired to come.

45
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,069
There is no energy.

46
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:11,569
And you see how sensitive, they become sensitive to noises, sensitive to quarreling. It is the noise, the quarreling and all that they feel they cannot handle.

47
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:26,829
So they have to have peace in their surroundings. Duty bound also. Just try to make a spherical kind of understanding of this patient.

48
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:41,309
Duty bound. They undertake responsibilities. They want to deliver, because they do not have enough energy, then anxiety, then restlessness, then effort.

49
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:52,129
Almost nervous effort, energy, they pick up nervous energy to deliver what they have to do. That makes them more tired.

50
00:13:52,130 --> 00:14:01,249
They go to sleep and sleep gives them no relief. They wake up in the morning in a terrible state.

51
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:22,849
And then they appear as if all the time they are in a sour temperament. We are using words, I cannot describe it more, I have to use words.

52
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:33,669
The sour temperament because they have been suffering a lot. Also things are happening and they are unjust.

53
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:44,079
They don't like them, they want to react. It is not a revolutionary reaction towards injustice that we see in Caust.

54
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:59,712
Caust.  will see injustice, it will jump, it will fight. Mag-m. will see injustice, it will try to balance things.

55
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:16,179
Caust. will fight, it's the anarchist. Sometimes in Caust. children you will see they are doing things that are very aggressive, very anarchistic.

56
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:27,919
Why? Because they cannot tolerate authority. Anything for them is authority. 'Don't tell me how to do it. I can't.'  This is the attitude of Caust.

57
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:38,899
And if they see injustice, they feel now I have the right to kill. These are the people who put the bombs. The anarchists.

58
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,340
 Give a Caust. case and give him a bomb and tell him that this man is unjust, he will put a bomb. He feels that he has to do it.

59
00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:02,030
Give him Caust., he doesn't care anymore. Not really but almost.

60
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:43,969
The old people will say that people who are affected by conflicts and confrontations, their liver may be affected.

61
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:56,529
The Mag-m. exemplifies exactly that situation. Confrontations will affect almost physically the liver.  They will make the liver dysfunction.

62
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:16,309
We had an aggravation from lying down in all symptoms and especially when we have anxiety and restlessness.

63
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:35,720
It's stiffness, heaviness, dullness, a state of confusion in the mind, it's terrible the way that they wake up.

64
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:35,720
This is the number 1 remedy. If somebody tells you, nevermind what is the condition he is suffering, 'when I lie down and I close my eyes then comes anxiety and restlessness and I have to get up'. This is a Mag-m. case.

65
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:46,690
 Another characteristic is the aggravation from salt. The aggravation from salt in all forms.

66
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:57,969
Whether they eat salt can be aggravated, eating a little bit more salt than the normal can aggravate their situation very much

67
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:14,099
and also going to the sea, it seems that the muriatic element like Nat-m is aggravated in the sea. The Mur-ac. is aggravated in the sea.

68
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:21,819
 The Kali-m. is aggravated in the sea. The muriatic element seems to be aggravated in the sea.

69
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:35,439
Mag-m. is aggravated by eating salt also which is a characteristic of another very well known remedy, aggravation from salt.

70
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:55,969
Who knows which is the number 1 remedy? If somebody tells you 'as soon as I eat salt, I become very ill'. There is one remedy which is very prominent on that.

71
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:07,239
 Phosphorus.

72
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:21,830
And another remedy is Selenium.

73
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:38,179
Aggravation in the sea, which is another remedy which has very much aggravation in the sea? It does not belong to the Muriatic elements.

74
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:48,540
Mainly it's a nosode but not Medorrhinum or Syphilinum.

75
00:19:54,520 --> 00:20:03,689
It is Tuberculinum. It is aggravated in the sea very much.

76
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:12,610
Also another remedy which is a complementary of Nat-m? It's aggravated in the sea also.

77
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:18,650
Sepia.

78
00:20:46,710 --> 00:21:07,690
Mag-m. is a cold remedy, aggravated by cold but in spite of that they may have warm feet, so much warm that they stick them out of covers during night in bed. They have to put out their feet in bed.

79
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:21,080
There are a few other remedies which are cold and warm in their feet.

80
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:40,010
 Calc., Lyc., Sanic.

81
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,481
Sang. is a warm remedy.

82
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,240
Chamomilla also.

83
00:21:54,010 --> 00:22:05,999
So Mag-m. you will see that they are cold, affected by cold, their feet are warm but what they want is to go out and walk in the open air.

84
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:14,420
So it is the same characteristic as another remedy which has that. Feels cold but wants the cold air?

85
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,730
It's Lycopodium.

86
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:57,620
The morning aggravation, the restlessness, the worse cold may lead you to think which remedy?

87
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:04,080
Rhus-tox.

88
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:25,699
How you differentiate? Rhus-t. wakes up in the morning very stiff with pains but Rhus-t. has nothing in comparison with Mag-m. has not the unrefreshness, not the heavy feeling, not the dullness.

89
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:38,519
It is the stiffness in the joints and stiffness on the muscles which makes a Rhus-t. case. They want to get up and move about to relieve the stiffness.

90
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:48,160
 Rhus-t. has a characteristic which is very great in desires. Desires?

91
00:23:48,910 --> 00:24:05,640
Desires milk very much. In Mag-m. there might be some desire for milk, there might be some aversion to milk. But what is most characteristic is that if they drink milk they will have an aggravation, they will have diarrheas.

92
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:16,509
Severe diarrhea which comes after drinking milk and a general aggravation from milk.

93
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:27,499
They have a desire for sweets and also for fruits.

94
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:43,010
And a strong desire for vegetables. Sometimes that can be an aversion to vegetables like the Mag-c.  Mag-c has primarily aversion to vegetables.

95
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:57,259
Mag-m. you will find sleeping on the left side mostly. And it's ameliorated by sleeping on the left side.

96
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:09,289
But if the liver is affected when they sleep on the left side, they have a dragging feeling as if the liver is dragging down.

97
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:35,069
They have quite severe jerkings,  electric like jerkings. Especially by the time they lie down, it's the time of aggravation for Mag-m.

98
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:54,499
Once they lie down whether it is dyspnea, whether it is the headache, whether it is the diarrhea, whether it is the colic pains aggravated during lying down, especially the first hour of lying down.

99
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:13,419
And all the Magnesias are aggravated by slight touch.  If you press deep hard it is OK but slight touch aggravates the pains or the situations.

100
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:31,389
Mag-m. can be quite hysterical because of that sensitivity in the nervous system, as I have described, they sometimes perform in a hysterical way.

101
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:44,500
And many times you will find some numbness in the extremities, indescribable, during a crisis of almost hysteria. Numbness in the lower extremities.

102
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:16,229
Also there is a great anxiety by the time of dinner, in the evening. During eating in the evening, it comes a great anxiety.

103
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:32,399
Anxiety also while reading but as I told you the psychology is such that they retract themselves. The take away themselves from society  and they go on reading.

104
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:59,470
And many times they like reading and their fantasy, their imagination is very active during reading. Exaltation during reading for instance. In a person who has been having that kind of temperament we indicate Mag-m.

105
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:27,729
They do not have much anxiety about their selves. Anxiety about health is almost unknown in Magnesias. Very few fears also.

106
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:39,890
You can see some fear of robbers perhaps which is almost natural.

107
00:28:53,100 --> 00:29:02,979
Dullness of intellect especially on waking in the morning ameliorated by going into cold air.

108
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:16,739
They don't want to exert themselves. The dullness becomes worse if they press themselves to keep on doing intellectual work.

109
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:25,499
Woman becomes very excitable during menses.

110
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:52,749
The tendency for suicide is very minimal in Mag-m. but in the morning there is what we call a loathing of life. They just don't want to go on living.

111
00:29:52,750 --> 00:30:03,499
That is in the morning when they wake up. It takes them about 3/4 to an hour before they can function again after sleep.

112
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:39,170
We have some characteristics in the head.

113
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:56,449
Headache which is mostly on temples ameliorated by hard pressure, is a characteristic.

114
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:08,499
Hard pressure ameliorates in general, it's a characteristic but especially the temples.

115
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:26,249
If you find a symptom like feeling as if boiling in the head, when lying down especially upon that side, that is a keynote.

116
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:46,009
Also headaches which are relieved sometimes by a few drops of lemon, they have to take some lemon, a few drops of lemon to relieve the headache.

117
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:58,529
That can become characteristic of Mag-m.  Also relief from lemon, from eating lemon, sour is another remedy.

118
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:06,249
Which is the remedy? It starts with P.

119
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:29,309
It's very characteristic, you have to remember that remedy. If there is an amelioration from eating very sour things, especially lemon.

120
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:38,589
You will see it in headaches, in stomachaches, in colic pains, in everything, they need sour things.

121
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,100
Which is the remedy?

122
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:14,600
Ptelea.

123
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:27,739
The headaches of Mag-m. can last 2 or 3 days continuously, without any interval.

124
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:33,999
Sleeps and wakes up with headaches, 3 days, then after a month again. After one and a half month again.

125
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:42,050
This can become a symptom of Mag-m. or which other remedy?

126
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:52,300
Ferrum metallicum.

127
00:33:54,230 --> 00:34:04,349
Also a headache which is ameliorated by pressing the eyeballs strongly. It can be Mag-m.

128
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:16,259
A headache comes in woman around the period of menses, either during, before or after menses.

129
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:59,759
Headaches which come before, during or after menses. Or it can be before, during and after. Around that period headaches, then it can be Mag-m.

130
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:12,639
Margins of lids become inflamed and crusty.

131
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:47,030
A coryza which is ameliorated in the open air can be Mag-m. and in alternation of the coryza from dry to discharge.

132
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:20,929
Neuralgias, facial neuralgias that they may become better after warming the face or after pressure.

133
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:41,279
In the stomach we have the aggravation from milk and many times also fruit and fat aggravates the Mag-m.

134
00:36:48,240 --> 00:37:16,500
Eructations that they are like garlic especially when they have a crisis of convulsions. That ends up in eructations at the end of the crisis
of convulsions, then it's only Mag-m.

135
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:27,739
So after milk we have diarrhea, we have indigestion, pain in the stomach.

136
00:37:38,220 --> 00:38:10,129
We have an enlarged liver, especially the left lobe. Enlarged hard liver and colic pains in the abdomen around 1 o'clock in the morning will indicated Mag-m.

137
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:24,029
Pains in the right hypochondria extending to the back, like Chel. and Lyc.

138
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:54,129
Pain in the liver region when lying on the right side.

139
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:21,659
We have constipation which is difficult to evacuate the stool with ineffectual urging, which makes it again like Nux-v.

140
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:29,409
Insufficient stool like Silica or Nux-v.

141
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:53,219
There is a constipation, sometimes in the babies during the first month when they have the pains from the teeth.

142
00:39:53,220 --> 00:40:01,600
When together with the pains of the teeth, constipation comes, the remedy most probably is Mag-m.

143
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:13,539
The stool is hard, knotty and large.

144
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:31,229
But after milk, it becomes diarrheic and mushy with tending to be yellowish white in color.

145
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:52,979
In urination we have cystitis with difficulty to urinate and has to press a long time before he can void a little bit of urine.

146
00:40:56,510 --> 00:41:10,890
And it is characteristic of Mag-m. they cannot pass urine while standing but they have to walk. As soon as they walk, the urine.... it's very difficult.

147
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:25,839
Sometimes they have an insensibility in the urethra and they may lose urine  without understanding it.

148
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:50,190
Mag-m. is one of the main remedies of loss of this sensation during urination. They don't feel whether they urinate or not. Together with Caust. and also Arg-n.

149
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:39,619
In women we have frequent suppression of menses. Either too frequent or suppressed, irregularities in menses.

150
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:58,429
Leucorrhea in the morning on waking together with Sepia.

151
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:34,909
Backache which is aggravated by coition, by sexual intercourse.

152
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:55,400
The sexual sphere of Mag-m. is not presenting a specific interest. It's almost normal. There is no much to be noticed there.

153
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:23,159
I'm just trying to give you the most important things to remember. If you remember what I told you, it's more than enough to be able to recognize a Mag-m.

154
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:41,280
Yet we do not have the full range or maybe it does not have other symptomatology on mental-emotional level to be able to pin it down.

155
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:16,850
Mag-m. also, you must remember in sleep if the person says, 'I wake up in 3 a.m. and cannot sleep after that time', one of the main remedies is Mag-m.

156
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:31,220
An aggravation at 3 a.m. in general can be a Mag-m. It's not only Kali-c.

157
00:45:38,970 --> 00:46:00,690
So to make a resume, to remember the remedy, it will be a remedy which is when an individual who is quite tired, is going through life with many many grieves in life

158
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:19,279
has become weak, tired, looks old, feels old, has developed a bitterness and a sour temperament, he is cold but ameliorated in open air, his feet are warm, he wakes up in the morning

159
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:36,139
very unrefreshed, his time of aggravation is 3 o'clock but mostly when he lies down and closes his eyes, he has anxiety and restlessness.

160
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:48,129
These things you have to remember and you will be able to recognize together with this idea of this individual.

161
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:53,629
Don't give Nux-v because when you will see that, you will give Nux-v, you will do nothing. You give Rhus-t., you give Nit-ac.

162
00:46:53,630 --> 00:47:11,130
you give all kinds of remedies, nothing. Why? Because the person does not have the personality of Nit-ac., of Nux-v., it is a different personality all together.
