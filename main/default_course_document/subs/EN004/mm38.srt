1
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:38,439
Most probably you will make a mistake and prescribe another remedy, usually the remedy will be

2
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:47,719
an anxious remedy like Phos., like Ars., Nit-ac.

3
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:54,840
You will think of these remedies until you see no effect...

4
00:00:54,841 --> 00:01:04,719
...and the patient presents a very
great anxiety about his health.

5
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:18,029
The problems in Lob. center upon the lungs
and the digestive system, the stomach.

6
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:28,339
Where there is a combination of an individual who is suffering with stomach problems, dyspepsia

7
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:43,319
gastritis, vomiting and at the same
 time complains about respiration...

8
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:51,849
...that is a case of Lob.

9
00:01:51,850 --> 00:02:06,119
Lob. people are very concerned
about their possibility to breathe.

10
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:16,139
Breathing is becoming a very important factor. They will tell you that 'I cannot breathe'.

11
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:25,549
 The lungs will be examined and almost never will be found something really pathological.

12
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:35,319
So it is a dyspnea which we can say is out of anxiety.

13
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:44,129
A dyspnea which comes with some
emotional disturbance or some fear.

14
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:52,439
They have a tremendous sensitivity
to cold and especially to cold draft.

15
00:02:52,440 --> 00:03:03,289
For instance, they will tell you that it is totally impossible to sit on a room with air condition.

16
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:10,739
Immediately they become dyspnoic and then the panic comes and then they have to leave the room.

17
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:18,249
There is a panic which usually
 comes together with the dyspnea.

18
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:39,399
So they are individuals who are serious, who will describe to you their ailments in a very serious manner.

19
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:52,379
They are closed, they are serious, not very communicative but behind their description you will perceive  the anxiety.

20
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:59,120
But it is not the anxiety of Phos.

21
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:06,029
They will try rather to hide the anxiety.

22
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,320
If you ask them, 'do you have anxiety?'

23
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:22,519
They will say '... yes' but actually the anxiety is tremendous.

24
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:32,359
Because the lungs have nothing and he says, it was impossible to sit there in this room and they have to leave.

25
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:44,879
They can leave parties, they can leave theaters, cinemas, any place which they feel there is a draft or an air condition.

26
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:52,799
They are people that they will
not run to the emergency room.

27
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,839
They don't reach the point where
they will go to the emergency room.

28
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,240
They feel that they have to
 do something themselves.

29
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,369
They feel that they need
 to rely upon themselves.

30
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:18,519
Though the panic is so much, I have almost seen nobody of Lob. going with the panic attack to the emergency room.

31
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:31,519
Where you will see these Acon. cases, you will see the Phos. cases, the Ars. cases, all these cases

32
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,949
they will go to emergency room.

33
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:50,949
Also they are individuals, as I said,
which keep inside the emotions.

34
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:58,359
If something is bothering them, they will not
be able to express it. They will keep it inside.

35
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:05,629
And eventually the stomach gets
upset and irritated and inflamed.

36
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:20,199
During the dyspnea attacks, they feel also sometimes that their heart may stop and there is

37
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:36,479
a peculiar symptom which they have. It is an emptiness and a feeling of nausea together with emptiness.

38
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,839
 This emptiness extends on the chest and mostly in the heart.

39
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:48,471
They are patients who will not give you a lot of symptomatology also. That's why you battle with them.

40
00:06:48,571 --> 00:06:56,380
That's why you prescribe wrongly for several times before you realize what is really going on.

41
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:09,369
Of course such individuals almost never smoke. You will not see any of these people smoking and if they go

42
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:15,709
 into Lob. states they will quit smoking.

43
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:25,679
The very idea that somebody is smoking in the room, it will make them run out of the room.

44
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:39,769
Once I had a case of Lob. with a Minister.

45
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:49,009
And I was prescribing Nit-ac.
 and I was prescribing Ars.

46
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:57,369
He was very dry individual and he
says, 'give me your telephone'.

47
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:07,200
And I had to come to Alonissos
 to do my holiday by that time.

48
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:13,779
 And I did not have a telephone here.
 I had a house but not telephone.

49
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:23,009
He was the Minister of telecommunications. So I said 'I don't have...', 'You don't have a telephone?'

50
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:35,109
He says, 'make an application', many years ago so I can... To get a telephone here in Greece you may wait

51
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:39,849
3-5 years during that time.

52
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:48,440
Make an application and write in the application that this is your professional place.

53
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:51,450
 By that time I was just coming for holidays. I said, 'no I cannot write that because this is not true'.

54
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,919
He said, 'but it doesn't matter, just write it'.

55
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,553
 I said, 'I'm sorry I cannot write it. You write it, if you want'. He wrote it himself and I got the telephone within a few days.

56
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:17,709
I just want to show you the kind of anxiety that they have. If they feel you can help them, because

57
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:29,359
give Nit-ac., Ars., a little bit better and
maybe the anxiety ...but not real cure.

58
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:48,479
This remedy is not easy to perceive. Now for me it's much more easy but during these years it was very difficult.

59
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:57,499
When you discover a remedy really, it's very difficult, your mind does not go straight.

60
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:02,450
Now if I see a case, I will recognize it.

61
00:10:02,451 --> 00:10:16,759
 Stomach, emptiness, dyspnea which has no pathology with anxiety and panic attacks.

62
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:26,959
Do you feel that any remedy of which we
have done is looking exactly like another?

63
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:35,219
Do you see the difference, the uniqueness in each remedy?

64
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:49,769
In a symptom or two, a lot of remedies are lookinglike each other but when you perceive the picture

65
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:53,029
 it doesn't look, it is unique.

66
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:05,660
This is the idea of learning Materia Medica of course.

67
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:13,440
That is the most important to
get it and to remember it.

68
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,020
Then you will be able to recognize it.

69
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:43,539
Ther. is another remedy that will look
like the remedy we did yesterday, Asar.

70
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:52,999
The reason is that both have a great sensitivity to noise.

71
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:15,519
They will say, noise makes me feel pain in my body. They can have a toothache and noise it can ...

72
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:20,279
...they have a slight pain in the ear
and the noise will make it unbearable.

73
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:26,439
They will have a pain in the stomach
and the noise will make it stronger.

74
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:33,209
Noise really exaggerates
 the pain in the body.

75
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:47,179
And these individuals will have
 a triple symptomatology.

76
00:12:48,160 --> 00:13:04,249
They have the sensitivity to noise, they cannot sleep and they have vertigo, something between dizziness and vertigo.

77
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:13,119
It's not that the things are turning. It is that it is strong dizziness which approaches the idea of vertigo.

78
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:24,329
These are also individuals who have
lived a life of sleeplessness.

79
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:42,669
They have never almost slept to be satisfied by sleep and the picture they will present is a picture of a mind

80
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:49,799
 which is confused and dizzy and vertigo.

81
00:13:49,800 --> 00:14:03,239
And then it can reach the point of even having Meniere's disease where we have the real vertigo

82
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,219
with nausea and the vomiting.

83
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:15,959
They are dissatisfied individuals that
they find no pleasure in anything.

84
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:25,739
They do not have the possibility to do a lot of work, due to that state of the mind and due to the vertigo

85
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:30,989
 and due to the dizziness.

86
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:40,039
And due to the fact that they feel constantly tired because they did not have enough sleep.

87
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:56,569
You have an aggravation from motion and especially with the vertigo they have to stay in one place

88
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:07,880
with the least motion. It will look to you like Bry.

89
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:29,889
But Bry. will sleep. These people their main complain is sleep and Bry. will not have the sensitivity to the noise.

90
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:44,019
Due to the fact that they cannot perform,
 they feel they never have enough time.

91
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,589
Time is not enough or time passes too quickly.

92
00:15:52,590 --> 00:16:04,559
You have a case that looks like Kali-bi. with a lot of discharge, with sensitivity to noise and sleeplessness

93
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:15,119
 it's not Kali-bi. But if you have a case where there is a lot of discharge, the discharge is sticky and there is

94
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:23,040
sleeplessness only between 2-3 o'clock, then that's Kali-bi.

95
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:30,609
But Kali-bi. is a different individual than this one.

96
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:46,569
These individuals are dried up individuals because of intense sleeplessness.

97
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:49,959
They have been suffering for so many years.

98
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,800
They are dry.

99
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:04,139
You see the person and you
feel there is very little energy.

100
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:22,559
They will speak in a manner which is soft, they will not get over excited about things, there is no energy left.

101
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:31,960
And they are exhausted and they will go to bed and they need to sleep and of course they will take these

102
00:17:31,961 --> 00:17:48,199
 earplugs and put it. Because in the night, forget it. They try ... and they sleep lightly and not deeply.

103
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:56,009
 And they have the impression, they will
 tell you 'I have not slept the whole night'.

104
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:04,919
So every day they are exhausted.
They cannot go and have a deep sleep.

105
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:26,479
Ther., I have seen it in anxiety of conscience. There is some kind of anxiety but not in all individuals

106
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:40,300
and there is some kind of mental disorder
which is expressing itself with some rituals.

107
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,600
They have some rituals.

108
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:53,520
They take a bath in a particular manner.

109
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:15,319
The mind of Ther. is not clear. It is a confused mind and they need to have a kind of order to do things.

110
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,500
Otherwise it becomes difficult for them.

111
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:30,190
Vertigo, dizziness, 'I'm suffering. I can't sleep'.

112
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,689
This is the idea that you will get from the individuals.

113
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,239
And you give different remedies.

114
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:52,759
They will never come because the noise makes pain in my body. They will not come and tell you like this.

115
00:19:52,760 --> 00:20:01,119
They come because they cannot sleep. They have sleeplessness and you enquire about different symptoms

116
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:13,689
 of different remedies which have sleeplessness. Is this Sulphur, one of the Kali's, Ars., Sep., Aur.?

117
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:23,209
And eventually when the mind comes in Ther. and you ask about noise, then they will say 'no I can't stand noise'.

118
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:25,519
 That is definite.

119
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:30,989
But they will not give it to you as
a primary symptom of their case.

120
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:38,159
So unless your mind goes to Ther. and ask
for the noise sensitivity, you will not get it.

121
00:20:53,500 --> 00:21:06,059
Back pain aggravated by noise or sits sideways on a chair, which are peculiar symptoms which I have not seen.

122
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:17,949
-I have a question on Ther. You said
 that they are somehow ritualistic.

123
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:27,361
Which remedies would you consider in
autistic people, who need this ritual but in...

124
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,800
-Autistic are not ritual.

125
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:43,479
 Rituals have people who are not autistic.

126
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:56,959
They have to do certain functions in order to start their day, they have to do first this, then that, then this and that.

127
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:03,000
If you tell them, forget these two portions it's not possible.

128
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:16,830
They are people who are not mentally retarded. Autistic children are totally mentally retarded.

129
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:30,499
-I mean they need a strong program autistic people. Everything has to be in order.

130
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:43,089
-No, they are not fastidious. They don't need everything to be in order. They need to do certain things in proper order.

131
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:54,329
They need to do things in a certain
 order. This is ritualistic.

132
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,669
What can we say about Nux-m.?

133
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:26,049
They are patients who have two main problems. The one is dryness of the mucus membranes.

134
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:35,529
And when we say dryness, we mean real dryness.

135
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:52,809
The lids stick. No tears, no salivation.
The tongue sticks on the palate.

136
00:23:56,130 --> 00:24:09,129
And they will have to sip water to moisten the mouth without having any desire to drink the water.

137
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:18,939
Sometimes they can even spit it. They just take the water and spit it, to moisten the mouth only.

138
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:43,639
Thirstless, excessive dryness and at the same time a state of mind which is very dreamy.

139
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:49,600
We say, live as if in a dream.

140
00:24:52,750 --> 00:25:02,079
 They will start doing something and the telephone rings and they will go and talk to the telephone

141
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,759
 and forget totally what they were doing.

142
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:15,539
They are putting things on cooking and this
can be forgotten and the food can catch fire.

143
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:27,039
 Their mind is not there at all in the job, they cannot concentrate in the job they're doing.

144
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:35,999
Somebody comes to bring something. They go out, they have been talking on the telephone,

145
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:44,359
they will leave the telephone, go there and forget entirely that they were talking on the telephone.

146
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:51,459
The telephone is gone out of the mind.

147
00:25:53,280 --> 00:26:02,360
That state is like being drugged.

148
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:22,929
 It is not an unpleasant state for them. They are in a state of wonder  but the mind is totally disintegrated.

149
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:37,329
Also they will be fainting. They are ready
 to faint. How is the state just before fainting?

150
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:46,799
A little bit before fainting where you don't
really perceive what actually is happening?

151
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:57,239
Things are becoming dazed. That is almost constantly the state in which they live.

152
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,579
And if they have a little shock,
 they may just go and faint.

153
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:20,459
And the shock comes easily if
 they see somebody is hurt.

154
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:33,079
They cannot stand somebody is hurt and
blood is running and ... they will collapse.

155
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:51,480
In that state, it seems that there is some problem with the circulation or the supply of blood to the brain.

156
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,879
And what you will have?

157
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:05,460
Either the fainting or the sleepiness.

158
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:10,449
They can be talking and
 they can be falling asleep.

159
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:16,739
They will read something and they cannot concentrate on what they are reading.

160
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:26,399
As soon as they concentrate
on something, sleep comes.

161
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,370
Narcolepsy, we have this expression.

162
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:43,070
Hysterical people, hysteria with fainting.

163
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,100
I can't stand it.

164
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:56,929
Straining in the stool can make them faint.

165
00:28:56,930 --> 00:29:13,679
We have this combination of sleepiness, over powering  sleepiness like which other remedy we have spoken about?

166
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,839
Opium.

167
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:24,920
You will have a difficulty
differentiating with Op.

168
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:35,700
And what will be the difference? Something which you have to ask immediately to differentiate?

169
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,430
-Op. is in an alert mood.

170
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:52,680
-No. Op. is not alert, it's in a happy mood.

171
00:29:55,690 --> 00:30:01,190
-Op. is painless, it doesn't feel the pain.

172
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:08,805
-There is no such a dryness in Op.
-That's it.

173
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:21,559
There is no such a dryness in Op. We said, main problem is dryness of mucus membranes. In Op. it doesn't exist that.

174
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:37,730
So immediately you see this state, they describe the state of their mind and the over powering sleepiness

175
00:30:37,731 --> 00:30:52,159
 the narcolepsy... You get sometimes you get a student who has this Op. state and you will see them sleeping

176
00:30:52,160 --> 00:31:02,610
 almost 3/4 of the time  in the class and
then they open their eyes and they go back.

177
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,959
I had a case like that. I said, come here...

178
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:34,080
Op. is juicy, thick lips and happy, satisfied.

179
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:42,629
The typical Op. is almost in a
constant state of good mood.

180
00:31:42,630 --> 00:32:01,639
But this good mood is maintained by lies, by just going through life in a very not correct way of contacting

181
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,959
 with the other people.

182
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:19,199
But they cannot keep awake.
 It's not possible. They fall asleep.

183
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:39,399
This narcolepsy state is not easy to cure also. It needed several repetitions of Op. before she was able to stay awake.

184
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:57,739
Another element which is there and it looks like Carb-v., because of the fainting, because of this....

185
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:08,070
... lack of power and the bloatedness, which
 both have, you may confuse it with Carb-v.

186
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:19,819
Also the women have problems bearing children. They may have a history of spontaneous abortions.

187
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:32,220
In general these people are prone,
are sensitive to little shocks.

188
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:43,229
 Whatever shock it may be, it has a disproportional effect upon their health.

189
00:33:44,210 --> 00:34:02,189
Apart from make them faint, they may have a small fright which other people will not have any effect

190
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:09,529
with Nux-m., it may have a big effect in the organism.

191
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:23,609
It may stop the menses. She has menses and the menses are stopped. And next month there are no menses.

192
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:38,609
If you have the beginning of an Alzheimer which will present this lack of concentration, forgets what she has been doing

193
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:50,999
in that state what she does not realize really, it is not an unpleasant feeling which she has, it's very strange.

194
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:03,119
Yesterday she was describing the state, she says emptiness, nothing, it's not unpleasant, it's not anxiety.

195
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:25,879
In Nux-m. is like living in the present, having no past at all, even 5 minutes ago there is no past, forgotten.

196
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:33,220
What is here, the telephone
 and what is the next thing.

197
00:35:33,321 --> 00:35:40,770
 The past has been totally wiped out.

198
00:35:53,470 --> 00:36:02,239
In a case like this that she was describing, immediately you ask, you have dryness of the mouth?

199
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:13,499
'Yes, I have dryness of the mouth'. How much? How much is important. The intensity.

200
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:21,709
Because if you open the Repertory and you see 'Dryness of mouth', you will see 200 remedies.

201
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:29,459
What you are looking for in
 Nux-m. is excessive dryness.

202
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:36,900
It's a syndrome which has this dryness.

203
00:36:53,990 --> 00:37:03,839
There is a syndrome which has this
dryness with dryness of the conjunctiva.

204
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:20,269
They have to put every hour artificial tears
 to wet the eye. That is the case with Nux-m.

205
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:26,760
And the mind also is drying out.

206
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:51,279
And the emotions become dried up, they don't have strength, the resistance is very low. That is the type of Nux-m.

207
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:59,060
Is this her case?

208
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:15,649
The more you know, the worse is
to find the remedy, I can tell you.

209
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:30,889
It's better you know 20 remedies and
you give Monday Sulph., Tuesday Calc...

210
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:51,760
Why the hell I have to squeeze my mind to do differentiation? I feel the problem that you may have and...

211
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:59,359
I understand very well, it's much more
 easy, you just give whatever comes.

212
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:08,619
Take 20 remedies, the french way, take
 them all, something is going to happen.

213
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:12,889
Something is happening but not a cure.

214
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:30,519
And then you have to battle so much but I'm sure that if you take these correct lines of prescribing, in the beginning

215
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:41,559
 it may be difficult but as you progress in years and you insist on that line, what happens is your knowledge

216
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:54,039
increases, increases...If you take the other
easy line, your knowledge is going down. Even if you know.

217
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:15,359
By the time you reach to prescribe 25 remedies together, you will say 'it's better I give up Homeopathy'.

218
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:23,309
Your knowledge is finished, it's very
strange. This knowledge does not stay.

219
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:36,199
This knowledge, if you practice incorrectly, it
will fly away. It's very peculiar, it doesn't stay.

220
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:43,729
Because it's so much and unless you put
 it into practice every day, it will not stay.

221
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:58,959
But for these smaller remedies, we have only to remember 3 points. Remember them not by itself, not dryness only.

222
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:04,039
Remember dryness and sleepiness. And when you remember dryness and sleepiness, then it comes

223
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:14,480
  that sleepy state which is going on in the mind.

224
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:31,689
This is a very important remedy.

225
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:52,799
This is a very important remedy today
 because we are all going crazy.

226
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:10,729
Because of over stimulation and we're going towards ...

227
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:30,349
It's very interesting that when I started Homeopathy back in 59,60,61,65, I would not prescribe this remedy.

228
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:41,419
As the years go by and I see difficult cases from the Center, more and more we need this remedy.

229
00:42:45,080 --> 00:43:14,019
It's a remedy that corresponds to a state of mind which is over stimulated, a mind which is very acute

230
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:28,249
over stimulated but there is a kind of peculiar twist.

231
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:42,630
A twisted mind, not a straight mind that thinks straight. A mind that thinks a little bit twisted.

232
00:43:47,320 --> 00:44:10,879
Also there is a strong element to show up myself, to show up how clever I am, but covered up.

233
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:25,189
The little children even which are a lot of them today, which are over stimulated because they hear information

234
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:35,209
 here and there and their mind absorbs all this kind of information and you see these children they are

235
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:40,959
very serious, they put very serious questions.

236
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:51,159
You see 7 years old and he talks about
 'what is your idea about God?'

237
00:44:54,200 --> 00:45:02,360
'What's your idea?', 'Well, I think he is the zero.'

238
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:10,309
And then you talk very seriously
 and they are very serious.

239
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:24,479
But in their mind is not the healthiness of a strong mind; it's the acuteness of a diseased mind.

240
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:47,469
They perceive things and they perceive also your faults, if you tell them a lie, they say why did you tell me a lie?

241
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:10,879
The main element which I found out with these people is that this twist in the mind it comes on the feelings

242
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:15,119
and it comes on the physical body also.

243
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:30,919
When you walk, you walk in a straight manner.
You put your feet one in front of the other.

244
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:44,399
The Verat. want to do something else. The organism leads them to do a movement which is an extra

245
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:48,339
movement of the leg.

246
00:46:50,110 --> 00:47:00,731
The eyes they go like this. For them, they will do an extra motion, it's very difficult to describe.

247
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:06,089
But if you get the idea, then you
 will recognize it immediately.

248
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:15,939
The mind is... and the emotions
 are... and the body is restless.

249
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:31,579
You get the children in the office, they will not stay quiet in an interview. They will just move up and down

250
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:38,919
asking question, taking this, 'what is this?
 Why you ask me this question?'

251
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:50,629
'Because I want to know how you feel'. 'I don't think you are right. You should not ask this question'.

252
00:47:57,390 --> 00:48:12,749
This excessive restlessness it may appear for instance in the knees. They sit down to study and there is

253
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:17,799
inside the knees, this restlessness.

254
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:23,569
And they have to get up, they cannot study.

255
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:38,839
Inner restlessness, outer restlessness, restlessness of the mind, quick minds...

256
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:48,189
but there is this kind of twist, as I said.

257
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:55,419
I told you about that child;
 I've been treating this child with Phos.

258
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:18,439
He came to my house here and the door had a net and there was a little open in the end of the net.

259
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:31,599
Then there was this boy and
 I caught his eyes looking at this.

260
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:42,399
The impulse was if I could
 just kick that and open it.

261
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:50,670
I caught his thinking and I forgot about it.

262
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:59,849
Then we left and then I go back
and I see the door is like this.

263
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:08,699
Of course I said, 'Lefteris come here.
 Who did this?'

264
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:29,519
He thought, 'how is it possible that he knows if I did this when nobody was present. How could he know?'

265
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:44,079
'Lefteris tell me'. So his mother comes, she says 'Lefteris never tells lies. So if he had done it, he would say'.

266
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:54,639
 But Lefteris he didn't deny it, he would keep quiet. I would say, 'Lefteris why did you do it?'

267
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:59,239
 and Lefteris would pretend...

268
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:08,430
But he would not say, 'I did not do it'.
His mother said, 'Lefteris did you do it?'

269
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:19,600
So I made it a point, every time they would come with his mother, the first time he comes, 'I say, Lefteris why did you do that?'

270
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:38,359
First, second time, third time, third day, fourth day, 24th day he said to his mother, 'why do we go to George?

271
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:46,119
 I can't because I feel depression,
he will ask me about the door'.

272
00:51:52,870 --> 00:52:03,169
He never said but I wanted really to know what he was thinking? What is this destruction element

273
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:09,419
 I wanted to find out and next year they
come for holiday, they come to my house.

274
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:15,520
'Lefteris will you tell me now why...'

275
00:52:15,521 --> 00:52:19,340
 He thought 'he must have forgotten'.

276
00:52:20,350 --> 00:52:31,849
 I pressurized him in a very nice way but I pressurized him and then he said, 'I don't remember'.

277
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:55,439
So clever. He did not lie, he did not deny openly but he never gave an answer and when he admitted

278
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:02,890
 he did it he said 'I don't remember'. 'I just want to know your thinking, what you were thinking'.

279
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:09,119
He tried to remember, 'I don't remember'.

280
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:26,159
And there is another element in Verat. which is very strong and looks like the Caust. element.

281
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:38,899
They are the supporters of the weak.
In the books it says...

282
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:47,969
 the savior, he preaches, he goes out when he is totally mad he preaches to save the world.

283
00:53:48,069 --> 00:54:04,499
But in the pre-stages of that, there is an
element of protecting others who are weak.

284
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:21,969
They work in a company. They will be the ones who will jump on the boss, on the authority and attack him

285
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:30,759
 and say how much he has been
 unjust for this or that person.

286
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:54,479
They also get fixed ideas that these persons are bad, these persons are good, never mind what you tell them.

287
00:54:54,480 --> 00:55:03,139
 The fixed idea is there and he will keep on insisting on his own idea of what he has understood.

288
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:24,649
The restlessness will lead them, as the mental restlessness progresses, it will lead them to do things which are useless.

289
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:40,600
They are on the telephone, like this.

290
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:51,119
It's not possible to sit down and talk. They take the telephone and go up and down, forget it.

291
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:59,869
The moment the mind works, the physical restlessness becomes more and more.

292
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:17,619
The physical restlessness also makes them not being able to concentrate on one thing they are doing.

293
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:23,869
They can be broken in their attention. They will do this and then they do that and then that...

294
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:47,909
Eventually if they progress in their mental disturbances...

295
00:56:51,660 --> 00:57:03,399
What is the difference between a person who is quite healthy and who believes in God and who is praying to God

296
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:15,000
between this person and Verat. also is
praying to God. And is praying constantly?

297
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:27,059
What is the difference where his praying is crazy and the other person's praying is healthy?

298
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:51,159
You take the symptomatology of the remedy and you see that the Verat. people have this element of 'I am clever'

299
00:57:51,160 --> 00:58:03,729
 'I am important, I am strong, I am going to protect others'.

300
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:16,059
That element in praying it is exactly the barrier between the praying and the other person.

301
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:27,000
In praying you say 'I'm very weak,
 I'm nothing, please help me God'

302
00:58:27,001 --> 00:58:31,139
Because when you pray,
usually you ask something.

303
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:40,849
You cannot pray and say,
'I'm great, look how clever I am God!'

304
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:53,519
That's why eventually he reaches that state where he goes out and says, 'Repent! Repent!'.

305
00:58:53,520 --> 00:59:05,719
He will take a big banner and write 'repent' or he will shout and walk up and down, saying 'repent, you sinners!'.

306
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:28,249
But all this is out of the need or recognition of 'how important I am'. It is not a humbleness.

307
00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:51,609
They will look very courageous, they will attack the authorities and the other people may be admiring

308
00:59:51,610 --> 00:59:56,649
them for their courage and for their acuteness.

309
00:59:56,650 --> 01:00:07,080
But all that underneath there
 is an element of self promotion.

310
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:20,239
That twist is there. What is this twist?
 I don't know.

311
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:28,759
I'll give you another example with the
little one I was talking about.

312
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:39,479
They were coming in my house about 10 children and he was the youngest. He was 5, the other children

313
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:54,719
 were 7,8,9, 11... and they started running up and down while we were discussing and eating and the children

314
01:00:54,720 --> 01:01:00,599
 got excited more and more.

315
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:15,959
At certain moment I shouted to them. I said, 'shut up, stop! all the children stopped and kept quiet.

316
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:30,680
Lefteris turns and says to me, 'who are
you that you will not allow us to play?'

317
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:39,089
I said, 'you play but not in this manner.
You're shouting and running, what is this?'

318
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:51,479
 But he was the only one who says, 'who are you to tell us...'

319
01:01:58,470 --> 01:02:07,039
They are haughty, it says here, it's not exact, they are haughty but they will not show it overtly.

320
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:14,609
They will put clever questions
to show how clever they are.

321
01:02:14,610 --> 01:02:33,249
They will not say, 'I'm clever'. They try to do it in a manner where you can't really say, you are haughty.

322
01:02:34,770 --> 01:02:38,919
It's an underlying issue.

323
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:58,979
Because of this ability to talk and the mind which is sharp, you will see they get very easy communication

324
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:04,087
 with others and with the women also.

325
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:21,379
So very easy for a man to get a girlfriend.
 Verat. is mostly indicated in men.

326
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:36,039
But the element 'I want you to perceive' is that element of sharpness, twisted, at the same time the idea

327
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:45,209
of the savior which is behind.
And which is not the real savior.

328
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:56,449
Somebody who really wants to
 help others does not do it in this way.

329
01:03:57,860 --> 01:04:07,080
Especially in spiritual situations.....

330
01:04:12,710 --> 01:04:19,959
....you don't promote yourself, you try to help others, you try to see what is the problem of the other person

331
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:25,249
and help them, without promoting yourself.

332
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:37,899
Verat., through their action, they will feel
very good when they become the saviors.

333
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:46,419
I'm suppressing you and a Verat. is there in the class. They will get up and say, 'you are suppressing us

334
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:50,059
you are doing this and that'.

335
01:04:50,060 --> 01:05:06,279
He will appear to be the savior of the class and they like afterwards to come and say, you did very well and all that.

336
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:15,839
Then eventually he will go to madness and... 'repent, repent!'.

337
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:29,849
But it starts much more subtle. Then you see
 the restlessness and you see this tendency.

338
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:43,799
It is difficult also in these cases the patient will not give you the information that he is doing that because

339
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:47,019
 it's his natural condition.

340
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:58,909
The others around the person will tell you of actions of that type and then you confirm your prescription.

341
01:05:58,910 --> 01:06:02,959
Dellusions they are Christ or a person that has saved the world.

342
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:24,759
In physical symptomatology we have coldness of the whole body, a feeling of water running on the skin.

343
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:46,269
Similar to what he described but with Verat.  you have more the feeling that it's running out. They drink some water

344
01:06:46,270 --> 01:06:52,089
 and they feel the water goes and runs on the outside.

345
01:06:52,090 --> 01:06:59,919
The water has gone really inside. Or the
 water feels running in their body.

346
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:20,360
This coldness and the tendency of this remedy
to produce diarrhea and vomiting, especially

347
01:07:20,361 --> 01:07:24,199
 forceful vomiting like a rocket.

348
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:34,960
And easy collapse from vomiting.

349
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:50,119
The body becomes very cold and vomiting, diarrhea and therefore was used in older times, in cholera.

350
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:55,109
It was one of the main remedies for cholera.

351
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:05,559
When I was in India they have told me of certain cases in which Verat. has helped in the cholera epidemics.

352
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:23,159
There is a great need because they lose these liquids, great need, thirst for cold water, cold drinks.

353
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:39,499
Desire for fruits, especially sour fruits,
unripe fruits and desire for lemon.

354
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:46,080
If you see this combination,
lemon desire and salt....

355
01:08:50,230 --> 01:08:57,999
....if these two are strong in a case,
 that's a case of Verat.

356
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:08,599
What they do? They take a lemon,
 they put salt and they eat it.

357
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:37,129
This is how you treat the children. The children instinctively will ask for lemon. They take lemon, put salt

358
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:47,879
and eat it, they go up and down. If you have
an asthma case with this and restlessness, yes.

359
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:57,859
Many times we have cured
 asthma in children with Verat.

360
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:14,119
It is strange that children today instead of being Calc., Calc-p., Sulph., they are Verat., so many children.

361
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:27,489
Why? Because of the condition in which we live and because of hereditary predisposition which becomes worse and worse.

362
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:43,169
Any kind of problems, during menses where the woman is upset with pains and then she has diarrhea

363
01:10:43,170 --> 01:10:54,929
diarrhea before menses,
with vomiting, with pains... Verat.

364
01:10:56,570 --> 01:11:11,609
Was anybody in a case in Germany in this hospital where I took the case of a woman with ...

365
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,599
-We saw it in the video.

366
01:11:19,590 --> 01:11:29,599
-This case unless you know the remedy, unless you know what she was doing with her eyes, you cannot

367
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:35,800
 recognize the remedy.  She was doing
 something with her eyes ...

368
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:45,829
I always find it very difficult to describe it. I have seen it with their hands, their movements.

369
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:51,759
 The movement is not harmonious, it's a twist.

370
01:11:53,550 --> 01:12:07,589
Or the foot or the hand or the elbow or the eyes there is a kind of twist, it's not normal, it's not straight forward.

371
01:12:22,930 --> 01:12:31,969
I perceive it very quickly when I see it because I know what is exactly but I want you to understand it.

372
01:12:34,190 --> 01:12:45,159
Because it's very important point for Verat. If you understand it, then you can immediately spot it.

373
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:51,149
If you don't understand it, forget it. You will see it in front of you and you will pay no attention.

374
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:13,919
-Will they be easily offended perhaps? Especially if they see that somebody is not recognizing them in what

375
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:18,559
they are doing or they have no respect?

376
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:28,119
-No. There is not a case of easily offended because they believe in themselves and never mind what you say

377
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:31,599
their idea is this, finished. They know.

378
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:43,119
They can be fixed in their ideas and nothing will change them. You insult them, you tell them, nothing.

379
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:54,749
-George do you remember the student in Celle? After every interview he went to the patient and said

380
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:59,719
George gave you the wrong remedy
 because I know you need Verat.

381
01:14:03,070 --> 01:14:15,009
-In Celle it was a doctor from France, the poor guy every time I analyzed a case, he had an antenna

382
01:14:15,010 --> 01:14:18,519
where he was examining the medicines.

383
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:31,289
The antenna says, this is your remedy and every time, all the cases that I had examined they were Verat.  cases.

384
01:14:31,290 --> 01:14:38,649
Eventually they told me, he goes and says everybody, he has an antenna... I said 'OK you come.

385
01:14:40,170 --> 01:14:51,409
I want to know my remedy'. He put down the remedies, he goes over the remedies and stops to Verat.

386
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:57,230
So he had given Verat. to everybody.

387
01:15:01,090 --> 01:15:12,279
I said to the class most probably he needs Verat. and next year unfortunately he was not in the class.

388
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:16,539
I asked about him and he was in the mental asylum.

389
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:25,729
He was mentally disturbed and
 most probably he needed Verat.

390
01:15:29,830 --> 01:15:39,069
But they will not come and ask for help.
They don't realize the problem.

391
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:59,159
-Tell me if I am wrong. What it says to me is that if somebody is haughty but they are so clever that to be

392
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:06,369
 obvious about it wouldn't be. They have to downplay it. They are nuts but in a secretive way but somebody

393
01:16:06,370 --> 01:16:11,440
for example who is a name dropper. Who makes like it's not a big deal to know someone famous.

394
01:16:11,441 --> 01:16:19,710
They downplay things because
for them to be obviously haughty is not clever.

395
01:16:20,970 --> 01:16:29,519
Also what it sounds like to me, I forgot
what I want to say....what remedy is that?

396
01:16:34,430 --> 01:16:48,549
- What you say is correct, they don't like when somebody is more clever and they will not overtly say to others

397
01:16:48,550 --> 01:17:00,559
 'he is not' but he will undermine
 the other person who is his enemy.

398
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:12,399
 because, as I said  they set their minds
 in evil, he is evil and he is divine.

399
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:26,400
It is a fore runner of a serious mental breakdown.

400
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:36,039
By the time they don't have the real mental breakdown, you cannot say.

401
01:17:38,230 --> 01:17:46,999
For instance the child if I had not given Verat.
 by now he would be mentally very disturbed.

402
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:56,599
If they go for years and years and I have seen like this child, this man that we're talking about, I have

403
01:17:56,600 --> 01:18:09,229
other examples also. Where everybody who understands Verat. says, 'he needs Verat.!', but he thinks

404
01:18:09,230 --> 01:18:17,739
'I'm clever, I know why
should I ask for a remedy?'

405
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:29,499
-He also thinks with the over stimulation
 of the media that they get old fast.

406
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:38,159
Especially in children, if they want to be a little bit more special than other children that they have to do things

407
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:43,259
with a corky way, just a little bit extra.

408
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:57,679
-Exactly. They want to be something special, therefore they need to do something extra, not the ordinary.

409
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:02,160
Because the ordinary everybody is doing it.

410
01:19:02,161 --> 01:19:17,279
 I have to be special and that special they
 canbe twisting the truth, twisting the facts.

411
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:24,679
Taking a fact and seeing it from a different
 aspect and becomes the opposite.

412
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:33,139
-It's the word circumspect like with Arg-n.?
