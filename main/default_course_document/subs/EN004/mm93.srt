1
00:00:29,603 --> 00:00:40,399
-I would like to know the difference between the aggression in Staph., there is a sweetness eventhough

2
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,479
 there is an aggression.
The difference between this and Puls.

3
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:59,449
-The aggression in Staph. does
not manifest. They don't show it to others.

4
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:06,940
The aggression in Staph. is such
 that when the person is by himself

5
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:17,649
he goes there and really becomes
 mad that did not the guts to attack, to say.

6
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:29,959
During that time they can reach a point
where they can get something and throw it.

7
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:43,720
The aggression in Puls. is different. It's
an aggression which has to be shown

8
00:01:43,721 --> 00:01:52,799
and Puls. can take something and throw it against the person, usually the husband.

9
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:14,879
But she makes sure that it will not hit him. She will throw it this direction, the man is there.

10
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:34,830
So it's a sweet aggression with Puls. and at the same time showing how she was hurt by the other person.

11
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:46,389
But it is a showing off in such a way to
 cause the other person to console.

12
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:55,350
'You are so sweet, don't worry,
I made a mistake, sorry'.

13
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:04,459
Crying, the woman responds with crying.

14
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,419
But if you get the aggression of
other remedies is different.

15
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:28,929
Staph. shows also extreme aggression
 if they are in an acute psychotic state.

16
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:41,689
She can be quite aggressive verbally
 and also throwing things.

17
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:56,369
But you have to bring Staph., after years
of suppression, to the limits where Puls.

18
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:01,359
will explode every time,
every day, every week.

19
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:19,110
-In Materia Medica Viva, as you describe Gels., you say that this remedy has the impulse to jump from high place.

20
00:04:19,111 --> 00:04:34,639
We meet that in Gels., in Arg-met. and in Staph. Can you tell us some elements about this symptom in Staph.?

21
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:58,600
Also it's Aurum. Aurum is the main remedy. Aurum they mean it, that means they are in a high place

22
00:04:58,601 --> 00:05:15,190
 depressed, they think they've lost everything
and at the spear of the moment they think

23
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:21,930
 'if I just jump, everything it will be
finished. I can't tolerate it anymore'.

24
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:31,210
At the spear of the moment the impulse
 comes and they jump. Aurum will jump.

25
00:05:31,211 --> 00:05:43,519
It's a clear mind during that time but the suffering that it has been through, it's intolerable according to them.

26
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,400
'I can't stand it anymore. I can't stand it'.

27
00:05:48,401 --> 00:05:57,600
They have described some of those people who survived from jumping, they have described saying

28
00:05:57,601 --> 00:06:07,599
'I was in the roof and I was looking,
saying now is your chance, jump, jump'.

29
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:24,930
And there is a kind of elation. The
 moment Aurum jumps is happy.

30
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:31,586
 They find happiness in the idea of death.

31
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:57,319
Now Gels. is totally different. Gels. is a person whom you see he is dazed in their mind.

32
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:26,400
They live along but with energy, no joy,
tired, dazed in their mind

33
00:07:26,401 --> 00:07:40,389
and they come to the balcony, they look down and say, 'I'll jump'. This type. The mind is not clear.

34
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:58,069
The balcony is pulling them down. Like Arg-n.
 the heights are drawing them.

35
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:19,730
The Staph. has sparks of this idea, of this thought, when they are in a high place.

36
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:36,750
'I'll jump, I have the impulse'. An impulse mostly with a clear mind not with a dazed mind. But they never jump.

37
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:56,269
Those who are dangerous when they have these ideas are the Aur., the Ars. and the Natrum.

38
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:59,430
Especially Natrum sulphuricum.

39
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:09,329
Those people can really commit suicide.

40
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:33,759
Of course what I give you is general ideas. There are modifications in each individual but I give you the main line of thoughts.

41
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:48,840
Aur-m. is the main remedy that attempts
 suicide, they really try suicide

42
00:09:48,841 --> 00:09:57,839
but almost always it is because of
romantic reasons.

43
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:06,719
Aur-m. are erotic people.
 Do you understand erotic?

44
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,719
Some good words are known very well.

45
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:26,799
They are people who fall in love
passionately and they get involved.

46
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:33,319
The other person at a certain moment
 says, 'well I had enough of you, bye bye'.

47
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,860
Then they will commit suicide but not really.

48
00:10:37,861 --> 00:10:46,260
They will jump from a place where they know is not going to kill, they take enough medications to know that somebody

49
00:10:46,261 --> 00:10:50,359
will save them, take them to the hospital.

50
00:10:50,360 --> 00:11:02,370
By intuition, it is not the
 hard decision which is taken by Aur.

51
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:24,959
Aur. will find the best way to do it and usually will jump or another way is by fast driving car and hitting the car.

52
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:46,960
In these cases the Aur. tries to get rid of the
 pain. There is an argument with his girlfriend

53
00:11:46,961 --> 00:12:00,399
 and there is pressure in him. He wants to do violence and says, 'it's not right that I will kill her'.

54
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:10,080
So he just kicks the door, goes and
gets the car, go speedy with the car.

55
00:12:10,081 --> 00:12:23,779
As he goes with the car he is
 thinking, 'I can kill myself'.

56
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:35,939
Then the opportunity happens, there is a tree, they turn the car and hit the tree and gone, this is the idea.

57
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:48,819
If they don't find the tree or the opportunity they may be saved because this crisis goes over and it goes down eventually.

58
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:59,209
So they may drive from London
to Amsterdam and calm down.

59
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:08,770
Not so long, just 20 min. half an hour, it calms down. If they manage to survive during this half an hour.

60
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:35,440
-Is there a remedy for someone who wants
 to commit suicide if they are insulted

61
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:39,039
and as a punishment to the other person?

62
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:53,290
- This kind of thinking comes
with Lach. mostly.

63
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:13,800
'If I do it, I will punish the others'. The idea of punishing the other is the idea with Lach.

64
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:29,839
But of course Nat-s. has a different idea. Nat-s. are thinking all the time, the idea of committing suicide is there.

65
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:34,920
It's a constant suicidal depression.

66
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:44,770
At the same time they're thinking 'If I commit suicide, my wife who loves me will suffer...

67
00:14:44,771 --> 00:14:51,159
my mother who loves me will suffer,
 my daughter will suffer'.

68
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:57,080
And this holds them but it is a struggle really.

69
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:15,279
When they confess they will say, it is a struggle. I'm thinking that I will give such a grief to others but I really struggle to stay.

70
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:23,170
The world has no meaning for me.
Life has no meaning.

71
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:37,509
And it is usually the grief on an emotional
level where the Aur. is not always emotional.

72
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:45,679
Aur. mostly is the loss of their ambitions.

73
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:57,200
 I was going to be the bank manager and somebody else took my position because they found out

74
00:15:57,201 --> 00:16:07,569
that I had an off-shore company
and there is degradation.

75
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:21,520
The person has fallen from where he put himself, in a high position and be respectable by the society.

76
00:16:21,521 --> 00:16:29,519
Suddenly if he loses that, the newspapers
 are writing, he stole money, he did this.

77
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:41,210
This can bring about an Aur. state in
the individual and they cannot tolerate.

78
00:16:41,211 --> 00:16:50,800
By this time if that happens, then of course they think also my wife does not love me, my daughter has left me

79
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:56,679
my son has done this to me,
 everything becomes black.

80
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:04,989
Everything comes together as negative.
And that is the time they jump.

81
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:28,849
That is why -for those who know economics, politics- when the crash in 1929 in America, it was a financial crash.

82
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:42,639
During this period were recorded much more suicides from jumping from a high place.

83
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:56,359
It is well known that a lot of people jumped and killed themselves during the financial crisis.

84
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:07,800
These people could be saved if a homeopath would give them one remedy.

85
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:15,000
I've told you this story with the guy who telephoned me and said, 'I want to kill myself'. I was in California

86
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:24,699
 in Berkley and he was in Las Vegas.

87
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:31,480
He says, 'I want to commit suicide.'

88
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:55,419
I had visited his house with one of my students, a medical doctor who had an affair with his wife, without me knowing anything.

89
00:18:55,420 --> 00:19:00,399
They did not tell me I'm going to have an affair, I would tell him....

90
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:32,559
Anyhow, he said 'your student made that and
this and that, so therefore I will commit suicide'.

91
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:41,130
I said 'when?', he says 'tonight'.
'How?'

92
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:57,009
Near Las Vegas there are some very high rocks, quite vertical, he says 'I will jump from the rocks'.

93
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:08,909
'I'll take my helicopter, go there and jump'.

94
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:22,919
I said, 'I understand you, you are right but will you do a favor for me?' Because he had a respect for me.

95
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:31,969
'Will you wait until tomorrow?
 You jump tomorrow morning?'

96
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:41,520
I said, 'you promise you'll jump tomorrow morning. I don't say, don't jump but jump tomorrow morning'.

97
00:20:41,521 --> 00:20:47,360
 He said 'OK, I'll jump tomorrow morning'.

98
00:20:49,420 --> 00:21:01,069
So I said to his wife, 'do you have Aurum?', 'Yes'. 'What potency?', '50M'. You give him now, immediately.

99
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:15,680
It was afternoon. Next day I received a call. I said, 'what happened?' He said, 'I decided not to jump'.

100
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:29,120
The change was dramatic. I don't know if he would really jump but the fact remains.

101
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:38,239
He says, 'the hell with all that, I will separate
 with my wife and I will not jump'.

102
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,279
I said, congratulations.

103
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:49,760
-He was a very famous, wealthy business man in England, he lost so much money with this financial situation

104
00:21:49,761 --> 00:21:58,879
and he set fire to all his property, all his
 family and finally himself. Is that?

105
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:14,050
-That can be but more sick than Aurum.
Maybe Aurum would have saved him.

106
00:22:14,051 --> 00:22:25,720
But sometimes people are in despair, especially in America several people they kill their own family

107
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,721
and they kill themselves because
 of the financial losses.
