1
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:45,499
Eup-per. is a remedy that has the picture of influenza when influenza is affecting all the muscles of the body.

2
00:00:46,720 --> 00:01:00,729
When you have a generalized muscular pain with the feeling of malaise that influenza is producing, nevermind

3
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:18,359
in what type of disease whether it is diarrhea, hepatitis, influenza or cold, then the Eup-per. is the remedy.

4
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:30,319
What is the difference between Eup-per. and Rhus-t. because you will confuse these two remedies, quite strongly.

5
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:36,120
It is several differences.

6
00:01:36,121 --> 00:01:47,489
First of all the Rhus-t. is much more restless and much more worse from cold.

7
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:57,839
This remedy is not ameliorated by motion as is Rhus-t.

8
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:12,519
Though the muscular pain is stronger in this remedy, much stronger and in Rhus-t. you will see a lot of stiffness as well.

9
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,329
This remedy is something between Rhus-t. and Bry.

10
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:36,300
Eup-per. is a remedy worse from motion, is a thirsty remedy...

11
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:54,629
 whereas Rhus-t. usually is not thirsty. It is thirstless. Sometimes Rhus-t. is also thirsty.

12
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:14,359
But here in Eup-per. you will not see the typical restlessness of Rhus-t. where it turns, is a bit better, then it has to move again.

13
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:21,919
Here is rather painful but they prefer to stay in one place.

14
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:29,319
But all the muscles till the bones, the pain feels right inside the bones.

15
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:48,879
The whole body and the malaise and weariness is very strong. It has the same reaction to coughing as Bry.

16
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:55,150
They feel very painful in coughing.

17
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:04,709
 We say, it holds the chest. It holds the chest because the pain is very strong and the movements

18
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:13,159
of the pain makes it stronger.
Which is more of the two?

19
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:22,099
Is Bry. in this respect pain from coughing
 or Eup-per.? Which is worse?

20
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:31,319
Bry. is worse. So when you have ... it is very obvious, then you will think ...

21
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:47,589
Because there is thirst and in Bry. will not be so much pain in the muscle. The muscular pain will be less for Bry.

22
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:55,779
This is the strongest remedy for muscular pain, the strongest in the Materia Medica.

23
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:07,039
It feels broken. The joint feels broken. The pain is right to the bones.

24
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:17,079
Where Bry. is not so sore in her skeleto-muscular structure.

25
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:24,319
It says 'delusions, he had walked along distance'. It is not a delusion.

26
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:44,609
When they describe the pain, they will describe it as if you had exerted and the muscles are very painful. It's not a delusion.

27
00:05:54,040 --> 00:06:08,289
And delusions that will go out of the mind. It is a state in which the individual says, 'I think I will go out of the mind '

28
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:11,884
which is the same as fear of insanity.

29
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:20,859
It is not a delusion, it's wrong word but it is written in the text. But I'm explaining it to you.

30
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:31,210
In the text is written like this but what actually means is that sometimes you hear patient saying

31
00:06:31,211 --> 00:06:34,959
  'I think I will lose my mind'.

32
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:43,109
And they say delusion. It's not a delusion. Delusion is something different.

33
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:55,679
The painfulness in the eyeballs, the painfulness can affect also the muscular structure of the eyeball.

34
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,560
When they turn the eyes, they feel painful.

35
00:06:59,561 --> 00:07:11,249
 You have to understand the malaise feeling, the pain, the bone pain that goes inside, the muscular pain

36
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:16,039
 and the pain affects all the muscles, even the eyeball muscles.

37
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:26,879
This remedy is ameliorated quite strongly with perspiration. Perspiration ameliorates the pain.

38
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:44,189
This symptom vomiting of bile during and after chill is of no importance really but it appears as a keynote

39
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:51,949
which I have not seen but if you ever find it, you can use it.

40
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:02,679
Bruised feeling as if broken bones all over the body, this is the idea with Eup-per.

41
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:17,679
Moans with aching pain. Of course if you
 pain so much, sure. The pain is too much.

42
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:24,679
-Trends to Arn. this feeling of being broken.

43
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:40,249
-Arn. has totally different picture. The pain is in the surface for Arn.

44
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:49,620
In the surface of the skin. That is why the idea is 'don't touch me!'.

45
00:08:53,950 --> 00:09:00,859
 This boy/girl here you can touch them
you can hold them, it's no problem.

46
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:11,999
With Arn. you will see the immediate touch... That means the pain is centered in the surface.

47
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:22,319
It might be very strong pain but it's a different kind of pain all together.

48
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:32,279
It's a thin pain. Here is a thick pain, a deep pain, it goes inside.

49
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:51,949
In Arn. you have to have in a flu, let us say where you will compare, the painfulness on the surface.

50
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:17,699
Euphr. is a remedy which you will recognize
 by looking in chronic conditions of Euphr.

51
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,259
In acute conditions also, why?

52
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:32,269
Because all the force of the disease is upon the conjunctiva.

53
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:42,440
The eyes become red, burning, lacrimating.

54
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:51,979
At the same time the nose is running but the focus of the disease is on the conjunctiva.

55
00:10:51,980 --> 00:11:00,901
The eyelids they stick together, they are inflamed, the conjunctiva is inflamed, it's burning.

56
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:07,659
There is chronic condition when the eyes are affected, the conjunctiva is the main remedy.

57
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:38,879
At the same time it can have a feeling of malaise. The head feels dizzy and full and sick.

58
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:55,689
The whole head in a flu, in an influenza, in a cold, the whole head feels very heavy, very dizzy.

59
00:11:55,690 --> 00:12:01,089
It cannot think and the eyes are red and lacrimating.

60
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:07,419
And the nose is running. The nose runs but it's not burning.

61
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:16,419
While the tears are so burning, the nose discharge is not burning at all.

62
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:34,749
They have a symptom which would look like Puls. where they get better in the open air. They need fresh air.

63
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:39,059
Especially in the head.

64
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:55,159
And they are better washing with cold water, for a few minutes. If they wash with cold, they feel better.

65
00:12:55,950 --> 00:13:06,509
The same like Puls.  You get headaches in the Puls. and they put a cold application for a while and they feel better.

66
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:32,719
The head is full and dizzy and I don't know if I give you the idea of the head...

67
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:44,910
When the eyes are burning and you don't want to think.

68
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:54,319
The head is full, headache is there.
You lie down with Euphr., it becomes worse.

69
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:04,240
But it is not a matter of immediate being worse. You lie down and a whole situation becomes

70
00:14:04,241 --> 00:14:13,579
worse and worse and you try to sleep. Then you get up, you go, you refresh, you put some water

71
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:20,669
 and then you try to lie down again. Lying down is worse.

72
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:39,439
Though if this inflammation goes down to the larynx and you start coughing and you have intense coughing

73
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:46,989
 this coughing is not anymore worse in the night.

74
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:52,180
It is the opposite. It's worse only in day time.

75
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:22,679
Fl-ac. in its mental-emotional sphere represents the degeneration in the moral sphere.

76
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,299
Degeneration, what do I mean by that?

77
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:43,419
They are sexually very easily excited individuals. They are enjoying very much and you understand that

78
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:51,159
if you overdo this then eventually it becomes degeneration.

79
00:15:52,550 --> 00:16:18,359
This is the time when sexual matters are treated in a very materialistic, physical way.

80
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,889
 Stimulation of the physical level, absolutely.

81
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:34,625
I had a case typical and I could not get the remedy. Then he was describing his sexual life and I said, what is happening?

82
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:42,129
He said, sometimes I wake up in the morning and I don't know who is the person whom I slept with

83
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:46,629
 what is her name, who is this person?

84
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:54,599
That kind of sexual behavior. It's a degenerated kind of behavior.

85
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:13,869
There is an inner anxiety eventually which
 leads to strong anxiety about health

86
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:24,839
and anxiety of conscience that does not allow  the person to relax and sleep.

87
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:34,309
Who gets anxiety about their health?

88
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:57,679
Phos., Ars., Arg-n., Agar., Calc.

89
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:21,159
This is also one of those remedies which can lead to tremendous anxiety with the fear that something

90
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:31,530
will happen to their brain. It will be having
a brain stroke and they will be distorted.

91
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:40,359
 You know how in a brain stroke the face is paralyzed and it is distorted?

92
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:49,839
Shall I get this? Shall I remain like this in the rest of my life? This kind of things and they cannot sleep

93
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,759
 they cannot go and relax and sleep.

94
00:18:54,760 --> 00:19:02,629
It takes them 2,3,4 hours before they go to sleep and if they go to sleep, they wake up early.

95
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:20,889
It's a remedy that affects the varicose veins. Varicose veins are quite strong feature with this remedy.

96
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:37,851
This symptom 'runs like a faucet', what it means is they sit and the nose runs constantly with no stoppage, water.

97
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:55,559
Another strong point with Fl-ac. is the falling of the hair in spots.

98
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:17,320
Sometimes you have the state of alopecia areata but this is not necessary.

99
00:20:17,321 --> 00:20:31,506
 To reach that state of alopecia. It's just falling in a place.  In a place you see the hair it has been very rare.

100
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:55,039
 In alopecia you see a place with no hair. In this you see a place with a few hair.

101
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:26,949
Not thinning, less hair. There is a place with less hair than the other place.

102
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:45,599
They are suffering from heat and sometimes Puls. will be confused with Fl-ac., why?

103
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:55,559
Puls. has a lot of varicose veins, aggravated by heat and this remedy has the same.

104
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:25,639
We have an easy decay of the teeth with cavities.

105
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:49,599
-Sometimes you get in Fl-ac., like in Nat-c., you get a sensitivity in both, cold and heat but mostly is heat.

106
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:59,735
-I ask for one symptom. It is a patient who is compelled to move about energetically? What does that mean?

107
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:06,839
-It's a restlessness but brisk restlessness like this.

108
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:31,159
It is a restlessness but not simple, it's more with energy. This remedy has a lot of energy to spend.

109
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:53,679
I have seen in this case people with tremendous sexual energy and they cannot control it at all.

110
00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:06,819
That energy may come as a restlessness which has a lot of energy.

111
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:15,148
-George what complains do they have? With what they come to the doctor?

112
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:36,479
-Different. Except of these ulcerations, venous stasis, varicose veins, hemorrhoids, sleeplessness, anxiety.

113
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:45,879
If it is on the mental level, you will get extreme anxiety with sleeplessness mostly.

114
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:59,279
If it's on the physical you will get decay of the teeth, decay of the veins.

115
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:06,699
-Does that sexual energy always have to be there or can it be that with young people maybe this energy

116
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:12,269
is shown in restlessness?

117
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:28,099
-In physical energy yes also. But, as I said, they are easily excited. They start from young age, having sexual

118
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:36,829
 pleasures this is a remedy which enjoys
very much sexuality, sexual pleasures.

119
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:45,519
Eventually they enter into a state of fear of dying, fear of what is going to happen to me, what is going to happen in my health?

120
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:52,509
They try, as much as possible, to keep a good health, to enjoy further.

121
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:58,929
It's a remedy which is centered around itself quite a lot.

122
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:06,929
-How do we differentiate from Lyc. on the mental-emotional?

123
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:12,279
-First of all, these guys here they are not afraid at all.

124
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:22,289
They can go and meet the Queen of England or they can meet the Prime Minister and no problem.

125
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:34,239
Secondly, on sexual energy Lyc. is much more on a superficial level. There is a superficial sexual energy in Lyc.

126
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:45,359
Once they overdo it, they lose the energy
and the capacity and they become impotent.

127
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:56,929
That's why Lyc. is one of the most frequently indicated remedy in impotency in men together with Staph.

128
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:07,559
Staph. for another reason, not because she or he overdid it but because of the opposite reason.

129
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:30,979
Staph., you see a man who comes with impotency but he is shy and he says, 'I like my wife

130
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,959
but I cannot have sex with her'.

131
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:43,779
Do you like other women? Maybe you like another woman and that's why you feel impotent.

132
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:58,479
He says, 'no I like my wife, I want to go with my wife and I cannot'. This answer you will never get it from Lyc.

133
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:15,639
Lyc. will say 'yes I'm impotent with my wife. How do you know? I can be very excited but if I try to go

134
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,540
a few more times, then I'm impotent again'.

135
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:31,159
This is the story of Lyc. The story of Fl-ac. is never mind what, I can go with this woman.

136
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:46,519
-How do you differentiate between Plat.
 and this remedy in sexual desire?

137
00:28:48,000 --> 00:29:01,009
-First of all this remedy is down to earth; that means no grandeur ideas, it's a materialist. Let's go to bed now.

138
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:19,209
And this remedy is satisfied. That means it has sex, enjoys sex and it's OK.

139
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:30,119
With Plat. there is a lack of deeper enjoyment where it leaves out something to be desired.

140
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:38,469
That is why the woman does not know if a Plat., whether she has an orgasm or not. She thinks she has an orgasm.

141
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:42,569
10 minutes later, she wants more.

142
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,219
Just to give you another example that comes to my mind from a recent case.

143
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:11,159
Plat., she says to us, 'during the sexual intercourse I have up to 20 orgasms'. What is this? I don't know.

144
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:25,509
You see we can only conjecture that she does not feel in depth any kind of satisfaction and there is no the normal

145
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:32,509
cycle of excitement, then a peak, then...

146
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:43,519
There is an excitement, the peak, it stays, it goes down, then up again, down, up again.

147
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:58,679
With Fl-ac. there is satisfaction and either the woman or the man they will not need to have sex repeatedly.

148
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,200
Next day again.

149
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:20,439
 It's every day, 365 days a year. You say, my god at your age 365 days a year? 'No, no I must have it.'

150
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:30,039
-You said 365 days the year and when I was younger I thought that was normal.

151
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:38,439
-Very good. Fl-ac.!

152
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:59,719
It is correct what you said, when I was young but I'm talking for a man who is 60 years old. It's too much.

153
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:08,439
When you have started at the age of 14 and you are 60 and all these years every day you had sex

154
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:13,289
that is beyond my comprehension.

155
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:32,379
That kind of energy. I think if I had that kind of energy I would have changed the whole world.

156
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:36,799
Not spend the energy.

157
00:32:56,250 --> 00:33:04,399
In Fl-ac., I feel it is a feeling of just me and my pleasures. And that's why they go eventually into that state

158
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:13,189
of tremendous anxiety about their health.
And a guilt conscience which is very deep.

159
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:21,319
 When this guilty conscience will come up, will have a lot of problems.

160
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,919
-Why do they have guilt conscience?

161
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:39,919
-Because they do all these kinds of things but never mind what you do in the depth of your mind

162
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:47,089
there is always a kind of control, of what you are doing.

163
00:33:48,010 --> 00:34:00,319
And there is a kind of critical attitude because of your conscience and they know they have done too much.

164
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:12,429
They had too much pleasure and they know that this is not correct. And therefore they develop strong guilty feelings.

165
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:28,349
They just come as pathology, the guilty feelings. The anxiety that they will die or that they have a disease

166
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:34,159
because they squander their life and things like that.

167
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:44,009
-Normally do you see them having family and children, taking responsibility?

168
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:55,120
-They may have a family but can a man like this stay married?

169
00:34:55,890 --> 00:35:10,049
 The men usually separate because the
 wife cannot tolerate all that behavior.

170
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:19,359
 The responsibility also is not very much.
They don't care about the children. Ok, they are there

171
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:23,019
  we support them, give them money.

172
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:39,919
-They are usually known for weakness, if you think of Mur-ac., Pic-ac, where there is specific weakness from Fl-ac.?

173
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:48,709
-I have not seen it in Fl-ac. so much weakness, no. We cannot talk as a main feature, the weakness.

174
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:56,369
All the remedies they have weakness. If you see weakness, all the remedies are there but now if we speak

175
00:35:56,370 --> 00:36:06,649
about the main features of the remedy that remedy in spite of being an Acid, I have not seen the weakness.

176
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:13,729
-Calc-f. also has a tendency to jump from bed to bed, isn't it?

177
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:28,119
-I don't know. Not as much as this remedy. This remedy is really impressive and you will not be able...

178
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:36,599
You will give Nux-v. because it's so energetic, you will give Tarent. because they are very much in a hurry

179
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:48,099
 it gives you the impression. And then you give all these energetic remedies that you know and nothing helps.

180
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:58,829
And you give the Fl-ac. and then you see the veins are developing and then they can sleep.

181
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:07,320
It goes to the physical body and then they become  more quiet.
