1
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:14,559
Something else that we have to have in mind, when we say 'ailments from suppressed eruptions'

2
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:27,169
we usually mean that the beginning states, that means during the eruption, the same remedy was indicated.

3
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:32,399
It was the same remedy that went deeper.

4
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:38,669
You don't understand that?

5
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:54,539
You have a skin eruption which
you suppress by cortisone.

6
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:09,959
And then you have asthma and then
you give Caust. and the case is cured.

7
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:25,639
Asthma was cured by Caust. Most probably when the original eruption was there, Caust. was still indicated.

8
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,630
That is most of the times.

9
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:35,135
 Of course there is a possibility that you have another state and you have another remedy.

10
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:48,679
But it is also useful to know that when, after skin eruption, you have given a remedy and it acts

11
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:55,999
the same remedy may be indicated for
 the eruption, when it comes back.

12
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:08,199
Graph. is one of these remedies which
creates a lot of eruptions in the body.

13
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:18,439
So if you suppress a Graph. eruption,
you will have problems in the inner organs.

14
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:27,449
What is affected mostly is the stomach.

15
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:37,450
Duodenal ulcers or severe gastritis, which appear after suppression of skin eruption

16
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:41,639
 most probably indicates Graph.

17
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:54,159
When a skin eruption is suppressed
and produces cramping pain or cramps

18
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:59,679
 most probably the remedy is Cuprum.

19
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:18,199
In this remedy the first thing we see it is a slowness, a heaviness of the body, in general.

20
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:29,699
The body is heavy, the physical body is slow,
the mind is slow, the body is heavy and obese.

21
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:50,839
The eruptions of which we have different types usually are discharging and the discharge which comes out

22
00:04:50,840 --> 00:05:06,559
is sticky and it's like honey. It's not like honey exactly but when you touch it, then there is a kind of string.

23
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,079
 You touch the eruption and it's sticky.

24
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:27,489
If you touch the eruption and you go like this and there is a string up to here, then the remedy is Kali-bi.

25
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:43,400
Too much information.

26
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,080
If you can remember it, it's excellent of course.

27
00:05:58,081 --> 00:06:10,239
You need to go through restudying your
 notes and really keep it in your mind.

28
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:17,469
Because these things have to be
learned almost by heart.

29
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:36,909
We have an obese individual with a lot of eruptions, who is at the same time, sensitive individual

30
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:49,149
 it can cry easily, they cry without reason
and especially they cry, if they hear music.

31
00:06:49,150 --> 00:07:00,419
It brings such a melancholy, they cry, without knowing why. Music will force them to cry.

32
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:28,879
An interesting part of Graph. are the nails. Except of the skin, the nails also are affected in, let us say, 90%

33
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:42,659
of the cases of Graph. you will see the nails are affected and they are either deformed, corrugated or breaking easily.

34
00:07:53,470 --> 00:08:00,000
Also in psoriasis, you will
see the nails are quite affected.

35
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:10,439
Which are the remedies which are
very much very affecting the nails?

36
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:29,039
Calc. yes and there are some other
 remedies like Sil., Nit-ac., Thuj.

37
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:39,639
Now you get a case of psoriasis and you see the nails are totally distorted or gone, eaten up by the psoriasis

38
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:44,029
and the psoriasis is concentrating upon the nails.

39
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:56,000
The other body is left free but this part is affected; that means you will have to search a remedy

40
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:03,440
 which affects specifically the nails. Which
 is one of these remedies? Graph.

41
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,959
You see how important it is?

42
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:24,309
You get duodenal ulcer. You look
at the nails, they are corrugated.

43
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:35,319
You can predict almost that he had an eruption, it was suppressed and now he has a pain in the stomach.

44
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:41,079
You can do that, like prophets.

45
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:51,039
Deformed nails, brittle, thick and hard, corrugated also.

46
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:13,889
Also another characteristic is concerning the areas where the skin is connecting with the mucus membrane

47
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:29,649
which again are the lips, the corners and which are also the rectum, the anus, where we see fissures.

48
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:34,649
Fissures in the anus.

49
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,430
In the eyes also yes.

50
00:10:52,420 --> 00:11:01,559
Discharge which is thick from the
 eyes, which is thick and sticky.

51
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:08,819
 Discharge from the ears which
is sticky, yellowish, offensive.

52
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:21,919
Discharge from fissures which is
yellowish, sticky. From fistulas.

53
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:53,719
Another seat of action is the ears where they get chronic otitis with hearing impaired, with discharge.

54
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:18,239
Also it is one of the main remedies for photophobia. They cannot stand a lot of light. Intense photophobia.

55
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:33,400
Callosities, calluses on the soles.

56
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:48,199
Mostly on the soles, sometimes on
 the palms but that's not frequent.

57
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:07,359
Aversion to salt, aversion to
sweets, aversion to fish.

58
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:16,050
Meat and warm food is secondary but if they have a case where it has these 3 aversions...

59
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,689
... you better think of Graph.

60
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:36,879
There is no other remedy which has
 these 3 aversions combined.

61
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:44,439
-Is the discharge from the ear concentrated
more on one side rather than the other?

62
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:54,069
-In the books it says yes but I have not confirmed that. That's why I don't put attention into that factor

63
00:13:54,070 --> 00:14:02,749
 because you see one ear in the books and discharge from the other and you miss the remedy, no.

64
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:23,339
The main idea is here obesity, photophobia, desires, aversions and discharges and the nails which are deformed.

65
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:42,239
The problem is that you learn this and you may have a case of Graph. if you are busy practitioner

66
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:53,269
after 3-4 months. If you are not a busy practitioner, you may have a case of Graph. once the year.

67
00:14:53,270 --> 00:15:00,720
You have to learn that and remember it after
 a year when he comes and you say

68
00:15:00,721 --> 00:15:05,920
 he was shouting to us something like this.

69
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:12,559
It happens like this because I shout
 too much, you will remember.

70
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:24,120
It was something with G... G... not Gels.,
Graph. You open the book and then you confirm.

71
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:39,539
These are the main remedies, later on we go to less important remedies that will be indicated even less.

72
00:15:51,790 --> 00:16:04,459
Graph. also to my experience are people quite healthy, talking about names of remedies which are healthy.

73
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:12,590
Graph. people are quite healthy,
 quite down to earth.

74
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:28,269
No nonsense, no flying of imagination,
 neither deep depressions.

75
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:39,040
They are obese people but
 their body is built solid.

76
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:49,110
 "Bowers", farmers.

77
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:58,669
 It's the one word I know in German
 that I can pronounce.

78
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:17,440
Graph. is the representative of the these persons. Strongly built, with eczemas

79
00:17:17,441 --> 00:17:25,609
with fissures, with nails deformed
and you will find these cases.

80
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:38,049
These people also they can tolerate quite a lot their deformities and they stay good for many many years.

81
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:51,020
There is a time when the itching becomes really unbearable and then they go and take cortisone

82
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:59,150
and internal problems start and
that's the time when they come to you.

83
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:20,079
Here is a Helleborus.

84
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:49,729
HELL - eborus to remember the state of Helleborus is the state of hell.

85
00:18:51,160 --> 00:19:11,250
I have never experienced in any other remedy, the anxiety, the agony, the state of the soul

86
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:19,209
 which is in hell and it's burning, suffering.

87
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:34,930
How the Christians they describe hell where you have things which are boiling and people inside.

88
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:57,289
Despair and extreme anxiety but when you realize that state, extreme anxiety. What happens to me?

89
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:09,319
Have you been on a boat where it's going up
and down and then you want to vomit?

90
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:18,090
There is a feeling as if your soul
 will come out of you.

91
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:26,769
Without the boat, the soul wants to come
 out from here, from here, from here.

92
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:34,600
And there is a state which really
 you say 'God help me!'

93
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:41,359
And you see the individual will go like
 this, restless, seeking for help.

94
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:52,519
Actually stating 'help me, help me'. What happens? He can't describe, he can't say.

95
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,729
You think he is going to die but from what?

96
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:10,639
The soul is coming upside down, inside, the sub-conscious has come up and it's overwhelming, it's hell.

97
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:27,400
When you see this case, the anxiety state with Hell., you give whatever and will not touch, will be worse

98
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:35,119
 Ars., Phos., you give Calc. nothing, Nit-ac.

99
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:47,759
You try all kinds and it comes there this anxiety, this fear, fear with anxiety, with upset inside.

100
00:21:49,270 --> 00:22:01,050
If somebody was trying to pull out your soul and the soul cannot come out. If it's out you say OK I'm happy.

101
00:22:01,051 --> 00:22:07,519
You cannot die, you are in hell and
they are pulling your soul out.

102
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,759
This is the state of Helleborus.

103
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:23,280
Answers slowly, weakness of
memory, all these are words.

104
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:34,109
What happens is the sensorial
part of the human being is blocked.

105
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:43,689
And looks but does not look, he looks but he does not see. He does not see you clearly, I mean.

106
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:53,440
When we see, we see the
eyes, we understand.

107
00:22:53,441 --> 00:23:01,459
I see her eyes and I know what she thinks, her fears, her anxieties and I see more or less what she thinks.

108
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:08,559
The Helleborus will look at you in a state
of panic and you see he cannot see.

109
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:19,599
If you ask him what he saw, he cannot describe. He cannot hear, that state is such an anxiety.

110
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:40,080
I remember my father in law.
He got at the age of 80, he got leukemia.

111
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:59,279
After extraction of some teeth, he suddenly developed leukemia and I didn't want to interfere.

112
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:06,889
My mother in law... OK take him to hospital.

113
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:11,880
 They took him to hospital
 and started with chemotherapy.

114
00:24:11,881 --> 00:24:20,399
One bunch of chemotherapy 7 days, then 7 days no chemotherapy, then second bunch with the idea to have 3 courses.

115
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:29,599
In the middle of the second course,
 it was a total collapse.

116
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:49,730
The blood was oozing from all
over, it was coming out.

117
00:24:52,320 --> 00:25:02,929
The plateles were very much down and then the hemorrhage started and it is the end of the case.

118
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,840
So they stopped the chemotherapy
 when they saw this condition

119
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:16,400
They said it's a matter of maybe one
more day, he will be gone.

120
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:30,860
Then I had the right to interfere with the case in the hospital. In the hospital it was one of my students also.

121
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,800
So I could manipulate easily
the whole situation.

122
00:25:34,801 --> 00:25:38,879
 He said, worse, we stopped, we don't
 anything more, finish. You can do.

123
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:55,680
And I remember I gave him immediately
Merc-c. and then immediately after that, Phos.

124
00:25:55,681 --> 00:26:00,600
and immediately after that he
developed that state of Hell.

125
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:15,600
He was half lost with the hemorrhages. The third, fourth day he came into that state of Hell.

126
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:32,359
All his life he was a very patient man, very quiet, patient, nice, soft and then he started becoming restless and calling...

127
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,760
Hell., the next day he was calm.

128
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:54,399
 In 15 days I took him out of the hospital.
Plateles we had over thousand.

129
00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:04,450
In 1 month all the readings
were almost perfect.

130
00:27:04,451 --> 00:27:14,479
 He still felt weak and he improved
until he was considered as cured.

131
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:25,969
But I remember that state of Helleborus because you see the person how he becomes under the state of Helleborus.

132
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:45,049
I have one or two cases on videos,
you will see more or less that state.

133
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:07,112
Of course the memory is affected also, forgets what he just read or done and there is irresolution.

134
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:13,610
Worse from 4-8 p.m.

135
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:25,859
That is interesting because we have another remedy, which is worse 4-8 p.m. How many know this remedy?

136
00:28:47,740 --> 00:29:02,459
Yes Lyc. but you see in this remedy
 we have the same hours.

137
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:17,610
Meningitis, encephalitis, rolling of
head from side to side.

138
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:28,059
With the anxiety, rolling the head in bed.

139
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:46,799
The chewing motion in mouth or the grinding of the teeth usually comes from an irritation of the meninges.

140
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:52,790
Here we say chewing motion of mouth.

141
00:29:55,110 --> 00:30:00,559
Bores head into pillow, vacant stare, brain cry.

142
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:15,040
And we have aversion to apples,
 total, it's very strange.

143
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:28,319
What apple has? It has a chemical which the body feels it is like poison. I don't know what it is.

144
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:42,920
I have cured a case, severe case
of allergy that was eating bananas.

145
00:30:42,921 --> 00:30:47,830
 Give me bananas.

146
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:53,589
Very strong desire for bananas!

147
00:30:53,590 --> 00:31:00,400
Tub. I gave Tub. and he was cured.

148
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:41,310
Urine is dark, red, almost black. This
is the tendency of the inner bleedings.

149
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:51,129
Then we have the dark, red urine like coffee.

150
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:58,399
The bleeding from kidneys,
from lungs, from everywhere.

151
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,520
Ailments after meningitis or encephalitis.

152
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:27,089
What is the ailments? It's the state in which I described to you, the loss of memory, forgets.

153
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:33,689
Where did I read this? I can't
remember, all this kind of things.

154
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,520
The rolling of head, from
 side to side is characteristic.

155
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,429
If you have seen one case, then
 you never forget it again.

156
00:32:50,430 --> 00:33:06,919
It is a state in which the agony is so much, help me. If you don't help them, they have to go to the asylum.

157
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:15,639
You cannot stand that state for long.

158
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:33,329
-I want exactly to know what looks like this person, when looking? Does he look as if he is looking through you?

159
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:46,673
-No. It is the agony and helplessness. 'What
 shall I do now? Do something quickly!'

160
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:55,820
I remember a case, he was going like that.
'Help me, help me, oh God!'

161
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:07,890
You stand back and you say,
what is this? What remedy?

162
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:16,832
If you don't kno, you had it. Because
 you cannot take symptoms in that state.

163
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:22,560
It is extreme. Do you like sweets?

164
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:49,599
Some homeopaths they go into
 that. What does it matter?

165
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:56,919
The whole thing is collapsing
and he is saying...

166
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:12,159
You have to get the essence. Tell me the idea. If you don't know the remedy, never mind the idea.

167
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:26,759
-Can this state be the beginning of heart attack?

168
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:34,780
-I don't know, maybe. Not in my
 experience but maybe.

169
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:43,359
But I would doubt because that state which I describe, is a mental state, quite deep.

170
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:49,530
Therefore the heart at this moment, it will function properly. It will not be involved.

171
00:35:49,531 --> 00:36:02,669
But you may have an anxiety, which can affect the heart which can be Lach., can be Aur.

172
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:06,439
This is possible.

173
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:32,210
Of course not all Hell. cases
 will be that extreme.

174
00:36:32,211 --> 00:36:46,659
But you get this dullness, this feeling of cannot think, forgets. What does it remind you?

175
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:52,679
It reminds you of Alum.,
 very good. Who said it?

176
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:12,959
It cannot think, cannot make a decision. Forgets names, forgets words, forgets numbers.

177
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:25,229
They complain of a mental dullness
together with a feeling of anxiety.

178
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:37,789
Students are very difficult to pass
examinations when they are in this state.

179
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:53,560
I knew a student, not Greek, I can't
remember now which country he was.

180
00:37:53,561 --> 00:38:00,319
 He was trying to pass the examinations
 for years in the University.

181
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:11,520
He could not. His mental state was so dull, so difficult to think and he was in a terrible anxiety

182
00:38:11,521 --> 00:38:17,319
because his parents were paying for his
studies and he wanted to please the parents.

183
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:26,670
And the more he wanted to please the parents, the more the anxiety was coming and there was this kind of anxiety

184
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:34,479
 agony and at the same time the
dullness and cannot concentrate.

185
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:42,399
You help these cases and it's like
 taking them out of hell really.

186
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:57,880
Niger is the black color.

187
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:10,519
It's a flower but the color, black,
the darkness, what we call the hell.

188
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:21,770
I don't wish anybody to be in that state.

189
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:03,480
Hepar Sulphur.

190
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:41,050
Over sensitive to pain. You see how strong it is?

191
00:40:41,051 --> 00:40:48,920
Fears suffering. Suffering is
very intolerable for Hep.

192
00:40:51,090 --> 00:41:04,509
They are afraid very much of injections,
 things that sting them, wasps.

193
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:21,409
I was treating once a grown up man, I thought he was a Hep. case. I said to him, 'are you afraid of injections?'

194
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:26,250
He said, 'Oh my God let me tell you what happened when I was in the army'.

195
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:38,389
In the army they undress them and they put them in line, the officer is putting an injection, next, next.

196
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:46,409
He says, 'I could hardly managed to reach.
By the time he was ready, I collapsed'.

197
00:41:51,980 --> 00:42:01,489
'The idea that he was going to inject to me, was totally intolerable. So I fainted, I collapsed'.

198
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:04,959
This kind of sensitivity.

199
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:14,529
I described to you another type where the person was fighting with the wasps and the bees and he was running all around.

200
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:25,689
These are very characteristic. Another characteristic for this remedy is over sensitivity to whatever pain.

201
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:35,729
They are people who are suffering
with mental and emotional pain.

202
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:58,349
A person is so vulnerable that you can imagine the family situation, for little reasons it will make them suffer tremendously.

203
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:13,279
A woman with her mother, usually
there is a kind of competition

204
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:19,529
between the mother and the
daughter because of the father.

205
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:28,279
They both want the father for their
 own. Usually there is a competition.

206
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:42,919
That can kill a Hep. patient because that competition is felt so much, so deep

207
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:48,219
 that can really torture the person.

208
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:57,649
It can really bring about such torture that you may have malignancy developing.

209
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:11,650
Organism who is so sensitive
 to pain, which is physical or stinging.

210
00:44:11,651 --> 00:44:23,619
They feel the psychological
 attack as if there is a sting, a splinter.

211
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:32,170
That's why the pains of Hep. are like splinter.

212
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:44,480
 They get this pharyngitis or laryngitis
and the pain is like a splinter there.

213
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,159
Similar with Nit-ac.

214
00:44:49,400 --> 00:45:06,920
In Hep. the idea is, the sensitivity is such that
he feels this sting, he feels whatever is pointed

215
00:45:06,921 --> 00:45:13,369
and the pain is like a splinter.

216
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:23,369
Splinter like pains in the throat,
knees, gallbladder, wherever.

217
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:32,960
Sensitive to cold air or slightest draft.

218
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:44,089
Who is sensitive to cold? The remedies
that are very sensitive to cold are

219
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:52,759
Arsenicum album and Calcarea carbonica.

220
00:45:54,560 --> 00:46:13,780
This is more cold than all the others with the characteristic that if they are in acute condition

221
00:46:13,781 --> 00:46:25,639
the moment that they take out of the blankets one hand, then there is an aggravation of the situation.

222
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:33,640
They cough more, they feel more the pain.

223
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:46,869
So draft is very much affecting them
 and also taking out just a little bit.

224
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:54,200
They say, if I uncover one part,
 the hand goes out of the blanket

225
00:46:54,201 --> 00:47:00,010
immediately the cough starts
 being worse, the sneezing starts.

226
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:21,959
People who are so cold that they have to cover almost everything and leave only this side, to breathe.

227
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:42,359
We have an over sensitive person who
reacts towards society in a peculiar way.

228
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:59,510
He feels inside him this vulnerability and
 giving out also an impulse which is violent.

229
00:47:59,511 --> 00:48:04,199
He wants to do violence.
He wants to put things on fire.

230
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:13,209
He wants to kill. He wants to
 do some kind of violence.

231
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:55,159
They are people with that sensitivity which are attacking, which can become rude and ruthless, abusive.

232
00:48:57,430 --> 00:49:08,570
And the impulse comes to kill like another remedy that we shall be talking about....

233
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:18,809
.... desire to kill, which is Hyoscyamus.

234
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:43,640
It's a remedy which we are using for skin eruptions, especially acne vulgaris and boils.

235
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:10,519
Unless we joke we cannot exist.

236
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:32,960
Acne which is painful,
which cannot be touched.

237
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:38,360
Painful to the exposure of the air.

238
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:56,580
And has desire for fat and spices. This is
 the peculiarity for Hep. Fat and spices.

239
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:04,060
 And she is better in a
warm, damp weather.

240
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:14,879
That weather which we have today,
damp and warm is good for Hep.

241
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:35,150
These people can stand very hot weather. We say warm but they can stand hot weather, damp.

242
00:51:35,151 --> 00:51:42,999
They feel worse in a dry environment.

243
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:57,499
Cold and dry, the north winds which
are cold and dry, make the Hep. suffer.

244
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:29,439
-Hep. being sharp tongued in his
form of attack to people?

245
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:40,159
-Sharp tongue I'm not sure but definitely they
 are people who have strong feelings.

246
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:47,359
They feel vulnerable, that they
 have been abused.

247
00:52:47,360 --> 00:53:05,559
And when they talk back, they talk in bitterness and in a kind of an abusive way but not sting.

248
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:16,250
They can be irritable, abrupt,
 abusive, angry.

249
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:26,909
For instance there is a remedy
which we will do later on, Sepia.

250
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:36,319
 Sepia is a remedy that will understand
 where is your weak point.

251
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:50,679
Very soon they will feel where is your weak point and they will say something exactly to that point.

252
00:53:52,770 --> 00:54:04,159
This is spiteful. This is not with Hep.
 Hep. is abusive, they will fight.

253
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:14,160
Sometimes they will have impulses
 to kill.

254
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:22,119
 But not real killing.

255
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:29,040
 It's not the remedy that will take
a machine gun and kill people, no.

256
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:20,430
Iod. is a patient who is burning
 very fast a lot of energy.

257
00:55:20,431 --> 00:55:32,119
 Producing, burning out food
and transforming it into energy.

258
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:38,690
So much energy that they
cannot really stand one minute.

259
00:55:38,691 --> 00:55:47,479
They have to be on the move, they have to be restless, they cannot sit down and study and read.

260
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:51,509
They cannot sit down and do anything.

261
00:55:51,510 --> 00:56:01,280
You can understand the inner probe that
 there is inside. Something pushes them.

262
00:56:01,281 --> 00:56:10,319
The energy is pushing them to get out the energy. Otherwise they feel they'll go crazy.

263
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:19,919
If you tie an Iod. person, on a chair, and say, you will sit there for one hour, he will go crazy.

264
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:25,690
He will break the chains.
It's not possible for him to stay.

265
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:37,969
 That is the central theme and of course with this energy which is produced, you can expect that is producing a lot of heat.

266
00:56:37,970 --> 00:56:52,439
So it's a hot remedy, very hot remedy with palpitations and a person who needs a lot of food.

267
00:56:52,440 --> 00:57:05,430
Because the food is burned out and then he needs more food and he feels very empty in the stomach.

268
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:15,120
Once the food is in the stomach, there is a calmness, for a while. The headache calms down

269
00:57:15,121 --> 00:57:20,319
 the pains calm down, the
 psychology calms down.

270
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:30,600
And after a while that the food is gone, then it starts again the restlessness, the emptiness, etc.

271
00:57:30,601 --> 00:57:40,319
Profound ability in great emaciation.
They eat and they lose weight.

272
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:46,669
Never mind how much they eat, they lose weight because they burn more than what they can eat. This is the idea.

273
00:57:46,670 --> 00:58:04,249
Then we have profound debility. The debility comes once the pathology starts and you have really a deep pathology.

274
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:23,149
That means the thyroid, which is the first to break down, in Iod. cases, then once it breaks down there is great debility.

275
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:37,270
A characteristic in the mental sphere is...

276
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:47,469
...they have a compulsive neurosis and they feel always that they have forgotten something, like in Caust.

277
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:55,960
Caust. they feel they have forgotten to close
 the stove, the door. Did I lock the door?

278
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:06,819
 They come back, they look and see it is locked, they go away, still they can come second time.

279
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:18,440
They get up, they go to bed, the Caust. and this is a similar situation with Iod. but the Iod. on top of this

280
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:25,319
 it has a compulsion for counting.

281
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:35,209
Counting the money, how much money? They put it back, they take it out, they count it again.

282
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:41,289
They go to the wardrobe. They count how many things they have in the wardrobe. They close it, they go back.

283
00:59:41,290 --> 00:59:44,809
It's a compulsion to count.

284
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:55,960
The mind speeds up and controls the individual.

285
00:59:55,961 --> 01:00:03,969
In compulsive neurosis we have the control of the individual by his pathology, the mind pathology.

286
01:00:17,370 --> 01:00:22,609
It says motion ameliorates. Sure.

287
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:40,759
We have constant motion of eyes,
especially in cases where we have a fever.

288
01:00:43,330 --> 01:00:47,879
Especially if the fever is affecting the brain.

289
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:56,319
We have a brain fever, that means encephalitis, meningoencephalitis etc. We see constant motion of the eyes.

290
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:05,000
We see atrophy of testes,
ovaries or mammae.

291
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:18,529
Where do we see undescended
testicles, in which remedy?

292
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:21,760
Aurum, who said it?
