1
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:33,670
We shall be talking about Agaricus this afternoon.

2
00:00:39,700 --> 00:01:09,450
So Agaricus has been famous for twitchings,
tremblings, quivering, paralysis, jerkings

3
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:27,190
and therefore it will be indicated in cases of neuro-muscular disorders,

4
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:43,100
multiple sclerosis and convulsive disorders, facial paralysis etc.

5
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:59,090
This is the note of action of Agaricus and
mostly frequently you use it in sciaticas

6
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:10,530
and lumbagos and also in hay fever.

7
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:27,910
And there is another aspect of Agaricus for
which I would like to talk mostly tonight

8
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:37,340
and it is the psychological make-up of the
remedy, which is not described in our books.

9
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:52,830
There is some predominant symptomatology on that level.

10
00:02:52,930 --> 00:03:04,560
What we see is a kind of retardation in the development of the mind and body,

11
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,180
retardation of the development.

12
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:18,570
We notice that from very young age when
children and babies are very late to walk

13
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:21,180
but also to talk.

14
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:43,190
I noticed also that Agaricus switched later on personalities that are weak,

15
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:52,150
with a weak will, we may say or a dependent character.

16
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:58,840
They need help, they will ask for help and they will ask it in such a way

17
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:08,090
that it will be given and then they will learn to have assistance, to have help.

18
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:22,060
They are people who from the early age will seek guidance from others and help.

19
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:31,933
And this tendency
develops from a kind of

20
00:04:31,946 --> 00:04:37,080
unwillingness to take up
responsibility themselves.

21
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:48,290
You will see immediately the element of slow development, a kind of immaturity

22
00:04:48,390 --> 00:05:04,380
that happens also in other remedies like
Sequata, like Baryta carbonica and Anacardium.

23
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:09,248
You will see it also in
Natrum muriaticum the

24
00:05:09,261 --> 00:05:13,130
late development and
especially in the children.

25
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:34,220
But what you will see it is most prominent
is a lack of grip, a lack of will power.

26
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:46,943
Therefore there will be
people that will give

27
00:05:46,956 --> 00:05:51,620
a lot of love and affection
to their parents,

28
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:58,198
to their teachers with the
idea behind that they

29
00:05:58,211 --> 00:06:04,700
will in return get some
guidance and protection.

30
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:21,620
But in this kind of development where we really find a problem in life,

31
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,240
they will try to find an escape.

32
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:32,370
Because you told me to do so, it's your mistake.

33
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:35,040
They don't want to take responsibility.

34
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:49,210
You see that element of retardation, of retarded maturity.

35
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:15,370
For instance if you talk badly to an Agaricus
child it's easy to go to convulsions

36
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:22,470
because they cannot take that reprimand, that you punish them.

37
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:28,720
And they go to convulsions, twitchings etc.

38
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:37,960
A lack of development, a lack also of
coordination between the mind and the body.

39
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:50,370
The mind gives an order to the hand to go
and take these flowers and put them down.

40
00:07:50,470 --> 00:08:02,120
If it's here and wants to catch these
flowers, their hand will go like that first.

41
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:07,280
Instead of directing straight...

42
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,780
There is a lack of coordination.

43
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:14,063
So while they are eating,
they try to take

44
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:19,270
something from the table
and push bottles down,

45
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:28,750
plates upside down and then they try to hold...

46
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:38,500
It's not a grip, it's no coordination. Clumsiness.

47
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:46,440
You see in the Materia Medicas mostly and in the Repertory in particular,

48
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:55,940
we have flat symptoms, clumsiness, the person is not coordinating.

49
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:10,020
But now and we synthesize and we put together all the elements

50
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:16,270
that constitute an Agaricus case in order to be able to recognize that case,

51
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:19,380
when we see it in front of us.

52
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:29,770
So it's not a simple clumsiness, that kind of individual who gives affection,

53
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:34,770
who is very sentimental, who listens to his teacher...

54
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:46,770
Because he cannot take it and then the twitchings start.

55
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:54,140
The nervous system is forced in a way that immediately you will see twitchings.

56
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,850
Force it more, press it more, you will see
more twichings, then you will see tremblings,

57
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:03,470
then press it more you will see chorea like symptoms.

58
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:10,790
They start moving, they make big movements and especially facial movements.

59
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:16,980
You see the nervous system is very peculiar.

60
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:22,700
In Agaricus you will see the nervous system is affected

61
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:30,700
and the reactions in the movements are like that...

62
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:36,790
but inside the psychology of the person is mild.

63
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:40,700
You see the facial expressions, they may show a kind of aggressiveness

64
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,190
but it seems that the aggressiveness on
the subconscious level has been imprinted

65
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:52,770
upon the peripheral nervous system, which produces these twitchings and motions

66
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:59,210
and the psychology of the person has remained mild.

67
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:06,073
You see almost a serenity
in the emotional level

68
00:11:06,086 --> 00:11:11,970
once the emotional
level is not affected.

69
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:17,970
Because as the pathology progresses we have
affections on the mental-emotional level

70
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:22,770
on the type that I shall be describing later.

71
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:42,030
Take now that constitutional type of person with the weakness,

72
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:49,460
with the desire to live a secured, a protected kind of life

73
00:11:49,560 --> 00:12:02,720
that the child has managed to establish because
he reacts nicely with his teachers etc.

74
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:12,820
and the teachers are protecting him and that
child is not prepared to take up a shock.

75
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,683
The child is not prepared
to take up a shock and

76
00:12:20,696 --> 00:12:27,070
the shock is going to
come sometime or another.

77
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:44,710
Its biggest weakness, Agaricus biggest weakness it is a shock which is connected

78
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:54,720
with some kind of death, either from heart or from cancer or from brain stroke.

79
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:59,960
Once they are faced with an event of that type...

80
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:06,460
In front of them somebody dies, whether their parents die or their relatives...

81
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:12,710
Someone who is close to them that they never
thought that they are going to be faced

82
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:19,620
with such a shock, then immediately we have the development of a psychology

83
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:25,290
which is logical now to develop such a psychology.

84
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:35,780
He does not want to see the reality, it's almost living in an intoxicated state,

85
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:42,290
living in a state of nice surroundings and environment.

86
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:53,210
The moment that he is faced with a shock then there is death.

87
00:13:53,310 --> 00:14:04,700
That means death can make and then we have the development of an anxiety state

88
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,380
that is overtaken the whole of the person.

89
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,290
Death, death, death... I will die, everybody will die.

90
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:24,788
The idea of decay and
suddenly the idea of death

91
00:14:24,801 --> 00:14:30,210
with all its paraphernalia
comes into the mind.

92
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:37,510
Death, decay and then the child or the grown- up start thinking about death

93
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,610
and how death may come about.

94
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:48,750
There comes some pain.

95
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:53,920
There is a little pain, which is not going to go away immediately,

96
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:59,520
the mind will go to the possibility of having cancer.

97
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:08,680
Immediately there is an overwhelming fear that this is cancer.

98
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:21,090
If that state is left to progress and now we
have a peculiar psychology with these cases

99
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:28,590
where the Agaricus cases they seem to attract information concerning death

100
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:37,520
or you may say in another way, whenever death is concerned they cannot forget.

101
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:41,053
So when they come to you
to the consultation

102
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:44,100
room and they will tell
about their sciaticas,

103
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,080
their pains, they will relate to you all kinds of death.

104
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:59,090
As you discuss you understand that there is an anxiety about health

105
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:04,500
and you say do you have an anxiety about health, you are afraid of cancer?

106
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,840
They say yes, how can I not be afraid?

107
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:14,410
Yesterday I had a friend and his friend
went to the hospital where they cut his leg

108
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,010
because he had cancer.

109
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,770
They tell you a tremendous story about cancer and how he died from cancer.

110
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:27,750
One week ago I had another case where my mother has a relative and this relative

111
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:35,090
had a friend... Again cancer and then they tell you all these stories of cancer.

112
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:41,043
Where am I living? Because
she relates all these

113
00:16:41,056 --> 00:16:46,920
stories of cancer which
are impressing her,

114
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:53,420
she relates whatever she hears about death,
the picture is impressed upon her mind

115
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,670
and she develops the anxiety more and more.

116
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:02,170
Most probably everybody has cancer, everybody...

117
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:11,420
and then it starts the real pathology on this level of Agaricus,

118
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:18,930
where the fear of cancer, the anxiety will grow bigger and bigger.

119
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:28,180
It will completely overwhelm them and sometimes they will reach the point

120
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:35,770
where they will say either I will lose my mind tomorrow...

121
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:42,600
There is no further fear to go to withstand, I cannot withstand further fear,

122
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:47,590
I'm going to lose my mind because of the fear of cancer.

123
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:56,270
In such cases with tremendous anxieties, you
will be prescribing mostly remedies like?

124
00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:07,680
-Nitric acid?
-Nitric acid, then?

125
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,920
-Arsenicum.
-Kali arsenicum?

126
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:23,930
-Kali Arsenicum, then?
-Phosphorus?

127
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:33,770
-Phosphorus, then Lycopodium, Argentum nitricum etc.

128
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:44,580
Before I was able to recognize that picture of Agaricus,

129
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:50,080
I was prescribing all these remedies with very little effect.

130
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:58,820
Cancer will be better, maybe nothing, maybe
this or that but not with the real freedom

131
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:03,340
that brings about the correct remedy.

132
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:14,670
In overwhelming anxiety about health, we have Agaricus in capital there,

133
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:23,340
where in the Repertory I think it's said it's ordinary...

134
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:45,420
Anxiety about health is there? No?

135
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:50,670
Hypochondriac and anxiety?

136
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:00,900
You can add Agaricus in anxiety about health.

137
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:06,650
Hypochondriac and anxiety also.

138
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:16,890
These cases, if you don't recognize it from the beginning,

139
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:29,360
they will overwhelm you because the anxiety builts up so strongly that even

140
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:35,350
talking on the telephone, they will break out crying on the telephone

141
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:42,110
because the anxiety is so great. They don't say the anxiety story.

142
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:47,460
This state now comes because of some little reasons.

143
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:59,030
For instance they might have a pain in the course of the sciatic nerve...

144
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,780
I want to move, I'm Rhus tox.

145
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:25,080
And sometimes Agaricus will have a pain on a
point, which is there all the time almost.

146
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:32,080
That is what they feel at least and they will
press it and press it and here it is again,

147
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,080
it's not gone.

148
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:38,168
By pressing that point,
they will irritate that

149
00:21:38,181 --> 00:21:43,180
point and they will
keep the pain is there.

150
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:49,470
That pain, there is something there, this
is what triggers the tremendous anxiety.

151
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:58,370
A woman will come with her breast and you
will search and search to find out something

152
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:02,470
which is maybe, which hardly exists.

153
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:12,290
Here in the (?) region they will search and
search, they say there is a nod there.

154
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:22,380
There is a gland swell, you try to find and you cannot find anything.

155
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:28,380
Their imagination is so big that they will imagine that it's really cancer.

156
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:41,710
If every half an hour the woman searches
and presses, she will aggravate the glands

157
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:48,800
and maybe sometimes there will be some gland swelled up but you can see nothing.

158
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:55,550
But the anxiety of that nothing is so tremendous that you cannot believe.

159
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:59,920
You say I can see nothing, it doesn't help.

160
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:07,268
Whether they will go to
10 different doctors to

161
00:23:07,281 --> 00:23:11,170
confirm that there is
nothing in the mammography,

162
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:15,143
there will be 1 or 2
days maybe they will not

163
00:23:15,156 --> 00:23:19,040
search and the third day
they will start again.

164
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,040
They say here it is, the doctor most probably made a mistake.

165
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:26,210
There they come to you and they will not say I have anxiety about health.

166
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:34,000
They will sit here and you will say what about that pain?
They will say nothing, nothing.

167
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:40,020
Then why are you crying? She says I don't know.

168
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:46,960
She is pressing so much to find whether the pain is strong or not.

169
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:51,160
What is there? The crying is not because of the pain.

170
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:57,150
It's because of the tremendous anxiety behind that this pain might be cancer.

171
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:13,760
That crying, asking for help but immediately
because it is cancer, you don't understand.

172
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:18,940
This is cancer and I have been to 2-3
different doctors and they say it's nothing

173
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,700
but it is cancer.

174
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:26,480
This is behind her mind, she won't talk, they are words that are not spoken

175
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:32,580
but what you perceive, what you feel is that idea of overwhelming anxiety

176
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:39,650
and then you dare to understand that maybe it's a case of Agaricus.

177
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:44,580
Because the pain is not really...

178
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:49,010
Do you really afraid of cancer?

179
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:59,900
Of course I'm afraid of cancer, what do you think?...

180
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:12,760
And then you will hear the story and you say
my god there are so many cases around you?

181
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:20,623
And then another story and
another story, another

182
00:25:20,636 --> 00:25:26,260
person and another person
and then you go crazy.

183
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:31,910
They all go to that particular person and everybody hears about such cases

184
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:41,670
but we don't pay attention so much. To the
Agaricus case this is a tremendous event.

185
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:03,288
You talk to them, you are
very nice, most probably

186
00:26:03,301 --> 00:26:08,910
this time you take
Arsenicum or Nitric acid.

187
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:36,490
The strange thing with Agaricus will be that once real pains come,

188
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:48,080
when the real sciatica pains come, the anxiety will reduce to 10%.

189
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:56,670
It's very strange because now she has come with tremendous lumbago,

190
00:26:56,770 --> 00:27:01,510
where she can hardly move or the leg...

191
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:15,390
You see real pain and the anxiety she has forgot it. This state is not there.

192
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:18,950
The psychological state is not anymore there.

193
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:31,090
We see this changing over from physical symptoms to great anxiety.

194
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:40,943
I remember a case, with
these sciatic pains, I've

195
00:27:40,956 --> 00:27:50,720
given the wrong remedy
and supress the pain.

196
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:58,660
Then I gave different remedies and for 1,5
year I was trying to cure that anxiety

197
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:06,660
that had come after the sciatica, which I had suppressed with the wrong remedy.

198
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,910
Nothing, nothing would help.

199
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:15,020
Agaricus took away the case and brought back the sciatica.

200
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:22,930
So you will see the exchanging of one to the other.

201
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:45,940
These people where many times will be obsessed with suffering around them.

202
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:58,090
It is peculiar that though they are afraid so
much of cancer etc. once it is not cancer,

203
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:03,083
they will go and help
cases where somebody else

204
00:29:03,096 --> 00:29:08,000
would not even think
of going and helping.

205
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:15,500
They hear of an old lady of 95 years old, living absolutely alone, dirty,

206
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:25,010
she doesn't have to eat, she is very sick...the
Agaricus they will go and help that case.

207
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:28,990
They will go right into the meat of the disease.

208
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:32,780
Of what somebody else would be terrified.

209
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:41,580
They seem to be attracted in hearing all these stories or looking after people

210
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:47,100
with such severe kind of diseases and illnesses.

211
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:55,000
Naturally you would think that these persons would avoid going sick persons,

212
00:29:55,100 --> 00:30:07,330
like Arsenicum, when they hear hospital, far from it, as far as they can be.

213
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:10,840
Phosphorus also, they don't like hospitals.

214
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:16,350
And Nitric acid... I have to go there? No...

215
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:23,850
Agaricus will rush into situations with suffering.

216
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:27,000
Do you see the difference?

217
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:31,403
There is a kind of immaturity
I would say, there

218
00:30:31,416 --> 00:30:34,160
is a kind of later
development of the mind

219
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:39,160
and late development of the system in coordination, twichings, chorea,

220
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:45,660
they cannot take an imprimand. If you talk to them...

221
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:56,910
A grown up, they can take so much and you say how is it that they don't react?

222
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:06,810
If you challenge, nothing to retaliate and
to hold back, no, they don't have that.

223
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:24,650
And they will go into twitchingsBut within that the voice is quite cold.

224
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:31,150
There is no the reaction that you expected.

225
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:42,310
Why you are doing the stupid thing 5 times the day, why?

226
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:50,740
And they say I'm stupid, this kind of reaction.

227
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:58,320
And the more you shout to them, the more the twitchings...

228
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:05,290
It seems that it doesn't penetrate their emotional level.

229
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:15,410
Emotionally actually they are quite nice
people and usually everybody likes them.

230
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:20,880
Because of that quality most probably that
they don't have the will power to go out

231
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,240
and tell what they think.

232
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:30,380
It is the mental part that overtakes that fear.

233
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:36,480
The idea that they may get fear overwhelms them completely

234
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:43,570
and then they will go into depression, a kind of.

235
00:32:52,330 --> 00:33:04,220
Perhaps in the books you will see the expression as if drunk, as if intoxicated.

236
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,310
You will not see drunk, you will not see intoxicated.

237
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:11,810
When you see a drunk person, you do not take it seriously.

238
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:20,760
It doesn't matter, it's OK I'm a fool. This is the idea behind.

239
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:49,110
They are not aggressive, they do not have spikes, their emotions are nice.

240
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:55,610
It's an animal that has only...

241
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:21,860
Never mind what you say like the Lilium tigrinum, you feel the spike, needles...

242
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:27,850
This is what the animal has. You feel...

243
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:37,580
Nevermind what you say to the Lilium tigrinum case, the answer will be...

244
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:42,090
Nux vomica a lot, Natrum muriaticum a lot of spikes.

245
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:49,190
Agaricus, nothing. They are sweet in that level.

246
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:59,170
Tell me what shall I do? Am I right? Should I go there?

247
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:07,920
The idea of non-development, the non-timely maturity.

248
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:11,520
They mature more slowly than others.

249
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:40,520
Another characteristic that you may see in their psychology is that

250
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:48,750
once this overwhelming fear, anxiety keeps standing a depressed state.

251
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:54,340
This is the only thing that gives them depression but it is very strong,

252
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,000
so it overwhelms their life.

253
00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:00,750
They say I have a nice life, my husband is nice, my children are nice

254
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:06,850
and I cannot enjoy, nothing. Why? Because all the time that pain is there.

255
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:16,510
She comes with sciatica and she can hardly
move and she says yes I enjoy life now.

256
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:23,000
It is not logical. The moment they tell you,
they try to persuade you that it is logical

257
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:29,850
that I have this anxiety because the pain
is constant, therefore it means cancer.

258
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:40,600
And therefore they live in a state of constant agony, depression.

259
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:55,520
It's almost impossible to describe to you the
intensity of the anxiety of that remedy.

260
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:06,420
I have seen it in a medical doctor and he would telephone all the time.

261
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:12,170
He is in the hospital and he sees another case and another case.

262
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:19,420
Are you sure that this case of mine is not...? I had diarrhea yesterday.

263
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,500
I say yes but you know, you are a medical doctor,

264
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,120
you know that one diarrhea doesn't mean anything.

265
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:35,330
Yes, yes but I'm afraid that this diarrhea of mine is a special diarrhea.

266
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:42,760
They try to make a point and you say no, no
please, don't be afraid and they go away.

267
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:47,240
And then two days later it's another case, now I have a pain in the chest.

268
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:53,910
With that pain, this is the history he took
from the patient who had pain in the chest

269
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:56,170
and now they have cancer on the lungs.

270
00:37:56,270 --> 00:38:01,170
And I have coughing... Lately I have noticed that I have coughing.

271
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:05,420
How many? How many? I don't know maybe 3 months I'm coughing now.

272
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,420
You are coughing 3 months and you never told me?

273
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:12,920
Yes I haven't notice but now I look back and I was coughing.

274
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,920
And you are still coughing? Yes I'm coughing.

275
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:18,520
How many times the day? One, twice.

276
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:24,880
So you have cancer? Yes.

277
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:29,650
But you are a medical doctor and you know that cancer is not coming like that.

278
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:34,130
With cancer you have to have also the exhaustion or other symptoms.

279
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:37,930
Yes but lately I'm feeling exhausted.

280
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:44,550
When we say exhausted, we mean really exhausted.

281
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:52,130
And then developing and developing and thinking and thinking what is the remedy?

282
00:38:54,760 --> 00:39:01,770
He comes to the office in a crazy state of mind...

283
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:15,630
I'm destroyed. Why you are destroyed? What happened?

284
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:24,210
This idea of cancer is overwhelming.

285
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:37,310
That is the state of Agaricus. It's not I have anxiety about health.

286
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:44,980
Like a Norwegian! Perhaps a Norwegian Agaricus could do that.

287
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:52,520
I have cancer, maybe?

288
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:12,370
Never mind how much I describe, when you see the case it's a different thing.

289
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:15,620
To see the case in different stage of development also

290
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:22,860
because you do not see only always in that
last stage I described to you with the doctor.

291
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:28,010
You will see it in lower forms also.

292
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:34,020
You will see it when the anxiety...

293
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:42,168
Another point that you
must remember is that

294
00:40:42,181 --> 00:40:47,680
they are concerned so
much with the relatives.

295
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:53,580
The woman about the husband, the husband
about the woman, they don't tell anymore...

296
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:00,580
I'm terrible all the time, so I cannot tell him.

297
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:08,430
Did you discuss the problem with your husband? She says no.

298
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:18,080
For the last 3-5 years I have destroyed him.

299
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:21,868
During morning, noon and
night are constantly

300
00:41:21,881 --> 00:41:25,580
talking about this, so I
don't talk it anymore

301
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:32,580
but I can't live anymore with that fear. That's the idea.

302
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:37,090
They are concerned that they have said so much, they have complained so much...

303
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:51,020
They feel that it is too much.

304
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:58,770
Themselves they understand but yet they will say I cannot get over it.

305
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:02,958
So you see their inner
struggle feeling that they

306
00:42:02,971 --> 00:42:06,170
are tormenting everybody
with their complains,

307
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:11,010
yet they are not able to keep inside the complain.

308
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:24,170
And suddenly you may see in such cases this
state to go completely away from the person

309
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:29,770
and another state, which is a very peculiar state...

310
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:44,990
we try to describe it to you, where the person
feels suddenly a tremendous energy arising

311
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:54,260
from inside them, a kind of joyfulness, a kind of exhilaration,

312
00:42:54,360 --> 00:43:00,860
a kind of almost ecstasy in which they go into it.

313
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:12,250
So there is a tremendous energy, exhilaration, joyfulness but again it's so much

314
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:17,663
that back in their minds
they say this is not

315
00:43:17,676 --> 00:43:21,250
natural, it is not
something that is natural.

316
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:26,590
It's going to burn me up, it's going to destroy me.

317
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:39,240
So the Agaricus stage can be alternating
and changing from one state to the other.

318
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:44,868
The difference is that
the state of anxiety and

319
00:43:44,881 --> 00:43:50,420
the state of tremendous
fear is much bigger

320
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:58,410
but in length of time than the stage of exhilaration and joyfulness and ecstasy.

321
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:06,920
Then in the book it says he will go into poetry, they make poets...

322
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:13,650
It seems that the mind becomes so clear, so
easy to perceive ideas, they live intense,

323
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,410
in the book it says he makes verses.

324
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:25,730
It's not makes verses, it's not makes poetry.

325
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:31,280
Sometimes I have found an Agaricus case that makes poetry

326
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:37,770
but what they do is they talk in an exhilarated state of mind.

327
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:45,280
They are talking in a state where they are more perceptive

328
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:51,880
but yet they will tell you that the energy, which is coming is too much.

329
00:44:56,380 --> 00:45:01,318
Once you see in the
history of a patient, you

330
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:06,280
see these ideas of
anxiety, anxiety, anxiety

331
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:13,040
and then suddenly to go into stage of exhilaration, loquacity etc.,

332
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:17,630
then you must remember Agaricus.

333
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:49,700
It is also strange that they seem to provoke out of the body experiences.

334
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:56,130
How many people have had out of the body experiences?

335
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,780
Half of the class doesn't know what it is.

336
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,280
It is a state where they feel that they are out of their bodies

337
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:08,150
and they experience different things.

338
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:19,690
That can happen to a stage of mediumcy. When
you go to a medium to tell you your fortune,

339
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:26,720
it is somebody that hypnotise himself and tells the future.

340
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:36,040
This kind of experience.

341
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:43,380
These Agaricus patients go out of their body easily.

342
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:51,280
They have experiences where the aetheric body jerks out easily.

343
00:46:52,220 --> 00:47:02,220
In such a state you would have expected that
the person would usually goes into panic

344
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:06,700
and this is a state with what remedy?
-Canabis indica.

345
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:14,800
-Canabis indica would be terrified with this feeling.

346
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:29,550
Agaricus cases have that feeling and they almost enjoy it.

347
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:35,210
They will lie in bed and try to have this feeling because they feel better.

348
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:43,470
They will tell you that after these experiences they feel better.

349
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:52,630
So if you have a patient who is overwhelmed with fear of death by cancer

350
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:56,370
and they are desperate and they say they want to die.

351
00:47:56,470 --> 00:48:06,370
Nobody of Agaricus wants to die really but
they say my life has become such a suffering,

352
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:08,880
I don't want to live anymore.

353
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:11,413
You say you want to die?
No I don't want to die,

354
00:48:11,426 --> 00:48:13,870
I want to live but not
under this condition.

355
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:19,450
This is the idea. So when they go into bed and they go out of their body,

356
00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:22,290
they feel rejuvenated.

357
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:27,310
It is a state of escaping from their tremendous anxiety.

358
00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:57,200
Agaricus we may see in latest stages of development of its pathology,

359
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:11,440
that they go crazy, they go out of their mind and you may see them

360
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:18,603
in a state of constant
loquacity, whistling in

361
00:49:18,616 --> 00:49:25,690
stage where they are in
very serious condition,

362
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:28,270
out of contact.

363
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:45,780
They will go into rages, into shouting and shrinking and in this stage

364
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:55,020
you may see that they will talk about prophesies, about catastrophes,

365
00:49:55,120 --> 00:50:00,280
about things that are going to happen in the future.

366
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:14,600
A stage within this fear of action of Agaricus is that they become religious,

367
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:25,018
they have religious
affections and these

368
00:50:25,031 --> 00:50:35,360
affections usually show
great simpleness or piety.

369
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:46,710
They are very sweet, very good... this type of religious affection.

370
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:15,510
From a general point of view we see convulsive stage

371
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:21,020
which alternates consciousness and unconsciousness.

372
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:26,100
They can into unconscious stage and then they come out.

373
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:37,310
Another sphere of action is hysterical kind of convulsions or fainting.

374
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:46,890
Especially when these convulsions or fainting
are precipitated by sexual intercourse.

375
00:51:51,140 --> 00:52:01,520
In their sexual sphere, they are quite excitable persons.

376
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:07,808
They can be very excitable
and very amorous

377
00:52:07,821 --> 00:52:14,020
because the imagination
is quite active with them

378
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:22,620
but they have maybe a lack of enjoyment during orgasm.

379
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:29,370
That means the orgasm is not analogous to the excitement.

380
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:42,290
And many times after sexual intercourse, they may have different problems.

381
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:49,780
Sexual intercourse aggravates the Agaricus case.

382
00:52:55,450 --> 00:52:59,560
In case there are convulsions, they will be aggravated after sexual intercourse,

383
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:04,710
In case there are headaches, they will be aggravated after sexual intercourse.

384
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:16,720
We have periodicity especially with convulsions that are coming once every week.

385
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:26,860
If you see vomiting ameliorates the convulsions, that means convulsions

386
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:32,450
end up in vomiting and vomiting ameliorates the convulsions, then it's Agaricus.

387
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:46,800
Chorea, when they move or the whole body moves and dances...

388
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:52,460
that is aggravated again by sexual intercourse.

389
00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:09,340
Whenever you see headaches, which are accompanied by twitchings of the face,

390
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:20,940
grimaces, this kind, that kind of twitchings, both eyes...

391
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:31,930
Headaches together with this kind of twitchings, you think of Agaricus.

392
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:41,830
As we said headaches aggravated by sexual intercourse

393
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:47,440
and also aggravated by spiritual liqueurs, by alcohol.

394
00:54:53,440 --> 00:55:02,430
Quivering in the eyelids or twitchings in the eyelids...

395
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:10,330
And if these quiverings or twitchings happen before a thunderstorm,

396
00:55:10,430 --> 00:55:14,700
then it becomes a case of Agaricus.

397
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:27,580
If you get little symptoms like that, they are peculiar symptoms

398
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:31,940
that you would like to have and indicate the remedy.

399
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:47,010
Also there is a lot of itching in the eyes,

400
00:55:56,020 --> 00:56:02,150
which starts from the eyes but it extends in the upper respiratory track

401
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:10,080
and you may have itching inside the throat and inside the ears.

402
00:56:13,330 --> 00:56:21,580
If this itching is aggravated during menses
in women, then it becomes characteristic.

403
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:34,580
The hay fever also is characterized by intense itching like another remedy...

404
00:56:40,090 --> 00:56:43,330
-Wyethia?
-Wyethia.

405
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:11,240
In the face we have the twitchings, in the
stomach we have increased appetite usually

406
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:16,330
but the appetite is lost after coition again.

407
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:22,990
You see the general aggravation of the symptoms
after coition, after sexual intercourse.

408
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:08,500
Another symptom that you may get is...

409
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:24,420
You may see especially in women a type of hysterical reaction after coition.

410
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:36,570
They start crying hysterically, without
knowing why and they have spells of fainting.

411
00:58:36,670 --> 00:58:40,920
They seem to pass away, to fade away.

412
00:58:55,720 --> 00:59:02,130
Another symptom you may meet with Agaricus and that you have to connect

413
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:09,620
with the weak will of Agaricus, in the sexual sphere, especially with men...

414
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:20,610
The sexual desire is quite strong, they get very easily excited

415
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:42,120
and they end up in pornography, looking at magazines with nude women

416
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:49,220
and get excited and go into masturbation.

417
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:20,860
Then we have the characteristics of Agaricus
in lumbagos, pain in the lumbar region,

418
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:27,450
pain in the sciatic nerves ameliorated by lying down.

419
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:35,610
Great amelioration from lying down, the pain is excruciating, they cannot walk,

420
01:00:35,710 --> 01:00:42,370
they cannot make a movement, they lie in bed and it is as if they have nothing.

421
01:00:42,870 --> 01:00:46,870
The amelioration is great with Agaricus.

422
01:00:56,120 --> 01:01:00,960
Aggravated by rising from a sitting position.

423
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:06,660
While stooping, bending forward.

424
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:23,880
There is stiffness in the cervical region,
which is aggravated by leaning forward.

425
01:01:28,370 --> 01:01:33,620
You may have also twitchings in the back area.

426
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:52,653
We have also trembling
in the extremities after

427
01:01:52,666 --> 01:01:59,210
coition and twitchings
in the extremities.

428
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:08,180
Coldness, generally they are cold and especially coldness in spots,

429
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:13,800
there is a whole small area, which is cold.

430
01:02:19,550 --> 01:02:21,280
Aggravated by cold.

431
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:35,030
I will just give you a brief summary of what are the main symptoms.

432
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:46,190
Tremendous fear of cancer, depressing states alternating with ecstatic states.

433
01:02:46,290 --> 01:02:50,860
The manic depressive kind but not the pure type.

434
01:02:54,370 --> 01:03:05,770
Then twitchings, (?) convulsive disorders, twitchings especially in the eyelids

435
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:09,460
and especially in thunderstorms.

436
01:03:11,950 --> 01:03:26,950
Facial grimaces, aggrevation after coition,
lumbago and sciatica better lying down.

437
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:40,460
Diagonal pains, the elbow left and the right knee.

438
01:03:41,490 --> 01:03:49,950
It is the right shoulder joint and the left knee joint, diagonally.

439
01:03:58,690 --> 01:04:08,280
Hay fever with deep itching that extends
to the upper respiratory truck and ears.

440
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:15,030
Coldness in spots and coldness in general.

441
01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:25,990
That is -you can say- is more or less the idea of Agaricus.

442
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:47,300
In studying a case, you may go to the books and see thousands of symptoms

443
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:52,100
but you don't know where to start and where to finish.

444
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:57,080
What I'm giving you is the essence of the symptomatology.

445
01:04:57,180 --> 01:05:02,610
This you can stick into your mind and you
can relate because always in your cases

446
01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:09,720
you will have to find these kind of
peculiarities to say this is an Agaricus case.
