1
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:47,295
The idea with Con. is not so much the idea of paralysis. Paralysis is there as a final action but the idea with Con.

2
00:00:47,300 --> 00:01:07,370
is that it produces areas in the body which are sclerosed, become hard. Which are usually the glands.

3
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:22,875
The glands become swollen and hard but also it produces areas of sclerosis, of calluses in the brain.

4
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:36,115
It seems that it is a remedy that is very set of certain ideas to the extent that it becomes, we say, superstitious.

5
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:45,240
They cannot get away from an idea that comes to their mind.

6
00:01:45,245 --> 00:02:12,005
It is also a remedy in which, the body will function well as long as there is a release on the sexual level.

7
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:33,215
Release, that means normal sex, regular times. Regular times they have to have the release of the hormones.

8
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:41,725
They have to be released to feel in balance. Otherwise the balance is lost.

9
00:02:43,730 --> 00:03:00,715
Therefore Con. you will see it many times being indicated in women who have separated and they are not having a new affair.

10
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:12,635
There are a lot of women once they are used to this regular, sexual activity and the husband dies, the woman

11
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,280
does not easily will have a new affair.

12
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:36,205
Because of this non-release of the hormones, then start problems which can be from vertigo, which is the first to appear

13
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:44,315
until she may develop even cancer. Especially cancer of the breast.

14
00:03:50,660 --> 00:04:10,515
Of course she has tumors, the idea of having hard tumors it may not be only in glands, it can be anywhere but mostly in glands.

15
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:26,115
That's why Con. is the main remedy for a gland that is affected by sexual activity in men, what is it?

16
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:41,125
The prostate gland. The prostate gland in Con. men is the first to be affected. If there is a suppression of sexual urge

17
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:51,945
it can cause in a Con. case cancer of the prostate gland.

18
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:02,265
So swelling of the prostate gland, it's very interesting we say practical people.

19
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:18,845
I found out really these people, Con. people are similar types with Platina but not as oversexed.

20
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:33,852
The practical side. 'I need sex', this is the idea and the release of the orgasm, that brings the orgasm.

21
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:43,485
This is what they need and their body can go on and function. Once this stops is interrupted suddenly then

22
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:56,075
 there is this kind of dizziness. They complain constantly. He says, my head is never clear. This is dizziness.

23
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:11,705
And the worst is Meniere's syndrome where things are really turning. In Meniere's syndrome things are turning around

24
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:18,325
and especially when they lie in bed and they try to change side. Once they try to turn...whether left or right, it doesn't matter.

25
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:40,491
 Also with sudden motion, they move just to look somebody behind, there is turning.

26
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:57,195
But the head, they complain about the head situation. It is that complain which is indescribable.

27
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:11,381
They use words, they do not say vertigo. They use words which they describe a state of mind which goes vzzz..

28
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:23,180
And it's a noise inside and it is buzzing and dizziness.

29
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:31,995
Con. is one of the main remedies for what we call superstition, why?

30
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:44,505
Superstition is a fixed, wrong idea that comes to the mind and they cannot get it out. It's like a callus in the brain

31
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:53,255
in a particular area of the brain. Otherwise they function very well, they function in society. But there is an area

32
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:57,840
in which they get a fixed idea and they cannot get away from that.

33
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,990
In the same way they are fixed on their sexual partners.

34
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:12,095
They are not the people who are over sexed and therefore will make it easy.

35
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:20,795
Once they take a decision and they have one partner, they continue until the partner dies.

36
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:28,672
You say, all Con. partners die? No, but these are the cases that we get.

37
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:45,305
And then they complain, the glands are swollen, the head is not clear and they are headaches.

38
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:52,635
Sometimes very severe headaches, non-describable. A headache together with vertigo.

39
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:59,575
They will say, sometimes is headache, sometimes is dizziness, sometimes is both.

40
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:14,685
And then you don't know, you give different remedies until they tell you suddenly they lost the partner and since 5,6,7 years, no sex.

41
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:29,875
Some organism can handle this. Con. organism cannot handle it. She will have problems.

42
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:41,720
In a keynote is the 'interrupted urination'.

43
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:54,235
 People with prostate or Con. symptoms they will urinate and the urination stops.

44
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:06,240
They wait, then it starts again. Then they wait. It starts again, it stops. 3,4,5 times before emptying the urinary cyst.

45
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:19,755
 So interrupted urination becomes a keynote symptom for this remedy that produces this sclerosis,

46
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:27,520
hardening of the glands and hardening of the thoughts.

47
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:38,165
-What would it be if there is hypertrophy of the urethra of the penis?

48
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:51,365
-Hypertrophy of part of urethra? Or stricture?

49
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,675
-Yes.

50
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:14,325
-Stricture you have to think of Thuj., Med. It is a kind of a local inflammation which eventually has become

51
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:23,155
has made a kind of tissues that have become hardened.

52
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:38,432
A stricture is not easy to cure but sometimes you see some release. And then the urination becomes more easy.

53
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:47,795
We cannot cure everything in Homeopathy. We have to know our limits also.

54
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:57,500
It's not possible. Sometimes it's amazing what we can do but at the same time we think that we can cure everything?

55
00:12:12,907 --> 00:12:26,475
When you have a combination of affections of rheumatic type, rheumatic or arthritic type affections

56
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:40,700
and at the same time you have an individual who is suffering with skin problems this will bring you to the idea of Dulc.

57
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:50,515
 In such a case you have to have a severe aggravation from cold and wet weather.

58
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:56,920
When it is cold and wet, Dulc. is suffering a lot.

59
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:20,355
Actually in older times when there were no electrical refrigerators they produced ice cubes that were in big boxes.

60
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:35,380
And the people who handled this, open the door, getting these big ice cubes,  put them there, deliver them, they could suffer.

61
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:46,105
 This is the best condition for Dulc. to get sick. And then Dulc. symptoms may develop.

62
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:56,775
They don't like ice, they don't like cold, they don't like cold and wet especially.

63
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:11,435
Another interesting thing is that it has paralysis of single parts.

64
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:27,435
And this paralysis may have its origin in the exposure of the people to the cold and wet.

65
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:36,455
So exposure to cold and wet and then paralysis of single parts, Dulc.

66
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:46,955
Exposure to cold and dry and paralysis of single parts, Causticum.

67
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:15,925
The difference is in the cold and dry weather, that means in the night of a spring time you get a motorbike and you go fast

68
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:25,095
and the cold wind of the night but it is summer and it is dry, hits you on the face and then you come down

69
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:43,490
with paralysis of the face, of one sided paralysis of the face. Then the remedy is either Acon. or Caust., it's not Dulc.

70
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:58,275
But if you drive in cold and wet situation in winter, then most probably the remedy will be Dulc.

71
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:13,075
Cases of Guillain Barre, paralysis that starts after exposure to cold and wet in winter, may need Dulc.

72
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:22,825
Another remedy of course they may need, is Calc-c. Because Dulc. and Calc-c.  are both worse in cold wet.

73
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:35,675
But if this patient says that at the same time, I have been suffering with skin eruptions, skin eruptions

74
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,915
paralysis of single part, under this condition, Dulc.

75
00:16:52,520 --> 00:17:04,755
About a month ago, a girl was sent to the Athens center, by the hospital in Thessaloniki.

76
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:10,920
She was in the hospital with Guillain Barre

77
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:29,395
and the only symptom that we could find was that she has been exposed to cold and wet near the sea.

78
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:36,275
She was living near the sea. In the night they went out or they forced her to go out something like that

79
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:44,360
 I can't remember, and the next day she came up with Guillain Barre. The remedy was Calc.

80
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:57,925
She is doing, as I hear, much better to the amazement also of the people of the hospital who thought

81
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:06,775
only cortisone or whatever they give that could save that child. Otherwise the child blah, blah, blah you know.

82
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:24,355
I have seen a lot of cases of Dulc. with people who are, especially women, who are very loving.

83
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:38,040
But loving with much possession.

84
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:54,680
That means they take of others but in a manner which is quite authoritative.

85
00:18:54,685 --> 00:19:02,570
'You do this, you do that. You have to do that'.

86
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:17,375
A kind of dictatorial, it's not exactly dictatorial because it's a concern. You married the wrong girl, the wrong woman

87
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:21,875
so I have to protect you from this woman who is a bad woman!

88
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:32,035
So you do this and that. I mean they will try to protect in a possessive way.

89
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,955
So all women who are possessive, give Dulc.

90
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:57,480
It says here: confusion, cannot find the right word, cannot concentrate.

91
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:16,575
Restless, cannot keep still; this reminds a little bit of Rhus-t. You will confuse it, many times you will give Rhus-t. instead of Dulc.

92
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:27,135
So these remedies are exchangeable because both they have skin eruptions and at the same time

93
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:39,920
 rheumatic and arthritic conditions. But the tendency for paralysis is more accentuated in Dulc.

94
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:58,175
If you can get this information alone you cannot imagine how many of your cases will be solved just like that.

95
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:12,915
Because this is after all an experiment. Here it's the first year we're doing this experiment. We'll see the result.

96
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:27,015
We'll see if the information I'm giving you is enough, it's not misunderstood. And if you really go and study and repeat

97
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:39,580
 I don't know if you go home and you ever look back in your notes. That's a big issue.

98
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:51,315
You say, we finished, no more obligation. But something will remind you, I'm sure something will remind you

99
00:21:51,320 --> 00:22:01,265
 George said something about this D, d, d..., you look at your notes in 'D' and you find Dulc. This is how it works.

100
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:11,155
 Later on we go more into details on the mental-emotional.

101
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:27,605
Then the information is going to be so much. I don't want that you overload at this moment with details.

102
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:38,075
You have to grasp the structure of the remedy first. Once you grasp the structure then the rest can stick.

103
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:50,385
Aggravation sudden weather changes, cold and wet and suppressed discharges. That is true.

104
00:22:50,390 --> 00:23:04,595
If you suppress a skin eruption and then you get headaches, you get rheumatic conditions or you get paralysis

105
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:16,115
one of the remedies you will have to think is Dulc., in case the person is aggravated in cold and wet.

106
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:28,875
This is key issue, cold and wet. Like it is a key issue for Calc. or for Rhus-t.

107
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:58,629
Thick, brown crusts. Chill between 7-9 a.m. perceived by great thirst with great soreness and aching of bones.

108
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:20,625
This is a case of influenza where the chill comes between 7-9 in the morning and then the fever rises

109
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:34,770
and there is great thirst but if it is 9 o'clock, after 9,10 with great thirst it becomes what remedy?

110
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,980
Bryonia.

111
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:53,915
You see? Little changes and it changes the idea of the remedy. Bry. is worse from cold and wet?

112
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:59,035
No, she is worse from cold and dry.

113
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:03,360
Do you see how you differentiate?

114
00:25:03,965 --> 00:25:15,155
You don't need too much information because anything you want you go and find it in the Repertory.

115
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:25,795
What you need is these essential features. That's all you need. But grasp them well, keep them.

116
00:25:53,640 --> 00:26:02,965
You have to remember two things, heat and explosion.

117
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:23,635
You will have very strong aggravation from heat, from the sun, sunstrokes, from fire, from sitting in a warm room

118
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:37,195
 in an explosive nature of headaches. Headaches which are exploding.

119
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:43,220
 Waves of bursting, pounding headache.

120
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:49,240
You feel the head is going to explode.

121
00:26:51,440 --> 00:27:04,130
When the patient says, 'My head will explode, I feel it'. Explosion, explosion, Glon..

122
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:24,315
You see how sensitive this remedy is to the heat? You see sunstroke immediately. Of course you don't have it so much in the north.

123
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:32,045
Here we have it quite a lot with the heat waves, a lot of people go to the hospital with sunstroke.

124
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:39,795
Most of them belong to two remedies, one is Glon. and the other is Nat-c.

125
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:59,055
But when we say sunstroke it does not mean only during the acute phase. It means also that after the sunstroke

126
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:07,035
you may have developed headaches, you may have developed depression, loss of memory.

127
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:26,515
Actually this remedy loses its direction very easily. They don't know which street it is.

128
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:34,555
They are in a street, they look at the street and say, 'now where am I?'. And it is a street in which they go every day.

129
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:44,755
 They go with the car every day and he says, 'now where the hell am I?'

130
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,455
Ambra to less degree.

131
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:10,155
This is the beginning of arteriosclerosis, because of pressure.

132
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:20,955
Because this is a high blood pressure remedy. High blood pressure remedies are the remedies especially which

133
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:30,915
are affected by heat and heat makes them feel worse and makes them having headaches. Which are these remedies?

134
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:51,595
Bell., Lach., Glon., Nat-c., Nat-m.

135
00:29:52,600 --> 00:30:01,575
They are affected by the sun, affected by the heat and then the heat produces headaches.

136
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:07,315
That means the vascular system is already in a sensitive condition.

137
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:22,205
The headaches of such a remedy will be aggravated by anything that stimulates the circulation.

138
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:34,215
So what stimulates the circulation? Alcohol, coffee also.

139
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:47,225
And alcohol also they cannot tolerate. They will have strong headaches.

140
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:58,620
Better in cold air of course. And better in shade.

141
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:15,005
Under a cool place, they need to be in a cool, dark place.

142
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:22,425
Even the light, the strong light, the artificial light can make the headache worse.

143
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:34,435
So you have to remember the explosive nature of this remedy.

144
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:56,415
Of course they are explosive people. People that they will explode suddenly.

145
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:02,575
If they do like this and they explode, they are temperamental.

146
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:11,835
Because there is a lot of energy inside. If they explode they save themselves from having headaches.

147
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:28,475
For instance I shout a lot, everybody knows, and that's why I can still teach.

148
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:51,985
High blood pressure, OK we said about that. Burning hot on vertex and back of neck. Heat and flushes of heat of course.

149
00:32:51,990 --> 00:33:03,280
And the heat goes towards the upper part and here it ends. In the vertex.

150
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:10,225
Which is another remedy that has heat on the vertex?

151
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:16,835
Sulphur, very good. He is a good student.

152
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:35,315
Sulphur has heat here but also where else? On the soles. Not this one. This one the heat goes up towards the head.

153
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:45,835
The head becomes very hot. The head is a sensitive part, then there is heat there, there are flushes

154
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:53,960
then there are explosive headaches.
 The sun is terrible.

155
00:33:54,940 --> 00:34:01,295
Glon. and Nat-c. people will go to the sea at about 7 o'clock in the morning.

156
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:06,775
That is the time they enjoy mostly going into the sea.

157
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:17,275
Of course most of the Germans are Nat-m. and also they go early in the morning.

158
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:37,585
It's very strange. One of my students, I will not tell names, he gives about 80% of his cases, Nat-m.

159
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:43,500
And he claims he has results.

160
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:58,725
This is a fact. By giving everybody Nat-m. actually because everybody has some grief

161
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:02,490
which is kept inside, will be some effect.

162
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:14,645
The idea is that you have to separate when to give Nat-m. or Nat-p. or Nat-c. or Nux-v. or Glon.

163
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:22,125
It's better than just patching up little things.

164
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:29,595
There are others of course who do something else. They say, while we have the miasms all together

165
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:41,415
why don't we make a mixture? A nice mixture of Syph., Med., Tub. and Carc. and give it?

166
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:50,995
And there is some miasm which is going to respond to this mixture and they give a name and say

167
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,835
this is drainage therapy or whatever.

168
00:35:57,290 --> 00:36:04,535
Somebody was telling me the other day another name. What name did you say?

169
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,885
"Protective", this is protective therapy !

170
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:27,945
So if you do things like that, of course you can give to everybody Med., especially the Greeks can get a lot of Med.

171
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:34,175
and you can see some effect. But it is not Classical Homeopathy.

172
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:42,275
You will never have the satisfying results that Homeopathy can give you.

173
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:53,995
You can do these things, they have been doing all along but what is there? It's so much difficult to learn this? It's not.

174
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:03,230
That is all the knowledge I have and I'm able to discriminate between one remedy and the other.

175
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:22,515
-One question to Glon. Geukens says from his experience that a Glon. patient who has headache and does like

176
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:33,635
and he's sighing or moaning this is a typical posture of a Glon. case. Is it true? Have you observed it also?

177
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:50,590
-I cannot say that because in my experience I have not seen this position.

178
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:20,515
Hyper. is another remedy that we use when the causative factor is injuries, especially on peripheral nerves.

179
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:35,575
Injuries on peripheral nerves which have as a sequence whatever, depression, headaches, epilepsy

180
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:41,515
they may require this interesting remedy.

181
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:54,115
The pain that causes is really bringing on fainting. It's so much pain that brings fainting.

182
00:38:55,360 --> 00:39:00,965
Depression of course. Depression can be after injuries of the head.

183
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:16,245
It is very interesting one of the doctors in the center in Athens, he was carrying a big television to show one video case.

184
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:36,485
And as he was climbing up the stairs, he fell down and he tried to save the T.V. and the TV. hit  his fingers against the floor.

185
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:48,181
And he managed to just bring the T.V. a little bit more steps and then he fell down. He was totally white.

186
00:39:48,320 --> 00:40:01,635
When they called me, I go and see he was totally white. What happened? He said, I fell down with the TV. and I hit here.

187
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:08,660
He was just ready to go away, he was trying to hold the pain.

188
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:24,765
Bring Hyper., you give Hyper., in 3 minutes Peter was standing up.

189
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:30,075
I said, are you all right? Yes. Are you going to come to the lecture? He said, yes.

190
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:38,320
This is the action of the remedy when it's indicated. Fantastic.

191
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:49,615
But not only for the acute state but it can neutralize long effects of injuries.

192
00:40:49,620 --> 00:41:02,635
Many times you get in the dentist. The dentist hurts by doing some extraction or whatever they manipulate

193
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:11,185
they hurt some nerves, nerve endings and then you may have the development of a trigeminal neuralgia.

194
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:21,475
Or a severe pain which the dentist says, I cannot see where it is. They make X-ray, they cannot find anything.

195
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:30,075
Yet the person says, the moment I try to eat, forget it, the pain is tremendous. They cannot find it.

196
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:43,315
It is a matter of trauma on the nerve endings. Then Hyper. will end this problem.

197
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:52,115
Pain shooting upwards along the nerves.

198
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:09,785
Asthma amelioration by expectoration. This is a common thing. I mean once you expectorate, it's not a peculiar thing.

199
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:35,855
When the coccyx is traumatized by a concussion, then the main remedies that you have to be thinking is

200
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:41,105
 Sil., Kali-bi. and of course Hyper.

201
00:42:51,820 --> 00:43:01,155
Especially if the pain has stayed in the coccyx. Sometimes a trauma in the coccyx, it may produce a lot of symptoms

202
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:06,665
along the spine and many times headaches.

203
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:16,155
Sensitive to cold, worse cold and lying quietly ameliorates. Desire for warm drinks, not important.

204
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:21,320
Motion, touch, pressure aggravate.

205
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:38,555
It says prevents lockjaw or convulsions. The idea is that if you have an injury and the injury brings on a lockjaw

206
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:44,715
 then you may be thinking of Hyper.

207
00:43:48,480 --> 00:44:03,985
Which are the other remedies which have a counter effect on injuries on the head?

208
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:21,205
Nat-s. Nat-s after head injuries mostly develops what?

209
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,205
Depression.

210
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:39,445
After injury depression with suicidal disposition, especially if the suicide is with shooting

211
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:46,555
then the first remedy we are thinking is not Hyper., it is Nat-s.

212
00:44:48,680 --> 00:45:03,950
But Hyper. also. Hyper. is the remedy we are thinking when there are nerve pains after injury. Shooting along the nerve.

213
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:18,825
Amputation also yes. Also All-c. that we have been talking, phantom pains.

214
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,705
They have amputated and the pain continues.

215
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:38,475
It's terrible pain, it's unbelievable pain which is not easy to manage and Hyper., also All-c. are remedies

216
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,945
 that can counteract that situation.

217
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:51,275
- Is it always a precondition to have these pains, shooting up along the nerves?

218
00:45:51,280 --> 00:46:02,915
Because I had a friend, and as she fell from her bicycle she fell on her mouth and injured two teeth

219
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:11,595
and her dentist told her that the nerves of these teeth have been injured. Then I looked it up in the Repertory

220
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:17,405
and in the Repertory I found Hyper. But then people told me, no that's wrong you made a mistake because

221
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:27,085
she did not have those typical pains. Anyway the woman could preserve her teeth but I'm not sure if that was due to my action

222
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:34,595
giving Hyper. or whether it would have happen anyway? The question behind the story is, is it wise to administer Hyper.

223
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:39,465
 if the dentist tells you that the nerves are injured or destroyed or not?

224
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:55,245
-Yes it is. This is exactly what I said. Sometimes teeth, actually the around situation from teeth, are affected by the dentist

225
00:46:55,250 --> 00:47:06,370
by an accident etc. In such cases Hyper. is indicated. 200, 1M, 10M.
