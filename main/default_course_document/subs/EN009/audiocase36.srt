1
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:43,910
-I shall give you the case of a girl 29 years old with fears and tachycardia.

2
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:54,150
She says since one year after the earthquakes, we had some earthquakes in Athens,

3
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:04,810
started strong palpitations.

4
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:22,140
She comes to us on 1st of February 82. The earthquakes are in February 81.

5
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:45,140
Strong palpitations, numbness of the left side of the body, chills and fears

6
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:51,230
and fear that she will collapse, she will faint.

7
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:02,160
She took different psychotropic drugs which did not help.

8
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:08,770
She also took the Inderal, no result.

9
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:19,770
During summer the whole situation was worse

10
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:32,920
and she is worse in the night when she goes and lies down, that's underlined three times.

11
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:43,160
Worse also when she eats, dinnertime, underlined twice and worse

12
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:49,510
when she does not go to sleep early.

13
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:04,020
If she goes 2-3 o'clock in the morning to sleep, the next day the whole thing will be worse.

14
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:18,160
When tachycardia starts, these palpitations start, the phobias become very strong

15
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:23,650
and she is afraid now it's going to have and earthquake again,

16
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,330
that the ceiling will fall down.

17
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,130
Worse also lying down for siesta.

18
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,610
Again some other times this crisis can come a quarter of an hour

19
00:03:55,710 --> 00:04:07,880
after falling asleep and wakes her up.

20
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,880
She has frequent urination when the crisis comes.

21
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:30,870
Bloatedness of the stomach and nausea during crisis.

22
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:46,130
Until June she was working in a factory with great stress.

23
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:55,380
She used to eat very lightly and always with anguish.

24
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:05,130
When she started to eat more and better food, the palpitations became worse.

25
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:17,790
Summer was her worst time. It was terrible, she said.

26
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:36,440
Desires and aversion from desires, desire for sweets underlined twice and egg,

27
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:43,040
oranges not underlined, aversion to milk not underlined.

28
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:51,520
Thirsty one underlined, drinks cold water one underlined.

29
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:05,270
Likes the sea, likes changes of weather, she likes the sun,

30
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:22,920
I'm afraid of going on a great speed in a car and she has great claustrophobia in an airplane.

31
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:28,680
That has been all along, it's not something that she developed last.

32
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:35,930
This is underlined three times. She said if I had to go somewhere

33
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:42,530
and I had to go all by airplane, I prefer not to go, I will not go.

34
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:52,060
She is a very vital person and quick in what she is doing.

35
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:05,190
She said she likes to sleep on the abdomen but because she has palpitation,

36
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:09,780
she avoids that and sleeps on the right side.

37
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,940
She does not take feet out of covers and sleeps from 11 to 6.30.

38
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:28,850
She said I need quite a lot of sleep in order to work the next day.

39
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:36,930
Fear of earthquakes three times, airplane three times, death three times,

40
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:48,770
fear of heart attack, fear of the future, fear of going to the cemetery, fear of dead people.

41
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,930
Feet are cold even during summer.

42
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:19,920
She is a nervous person, she shouts and she expresses herself during irritability.

43
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:25,700
Desires company underlined twice, discuss about the problem,

44
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:33,930
she doesn't want any kind of consolation, she is easily insulted

45
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:41,270
and sex is higher than normal, a little bit higher, it's not underlined once.

46
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:10,180
Earthquakes and planes and death are underlined three times, the other fears,

47
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:17,920
fear of the heart is underlined once, fear of the future, on cemetery

48
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,510
and dead people not underlined.

49
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,770
Cold feet.

50
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,150
-Was the earthquake a very severe earthquake?

51
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:05,910
-Yes it was, great shock for many. During that time to this earthquake

52
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:14,670
we had to treat quite a lot of people that they got a shock and could not get over it.

53
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,090
And we treated quite a lot.

54
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:31,240
Has anyone of you been in an earthquake?
-Yes.

55
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:36,750
-In a big earthquake?
-No.

56
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,920
-For claustrophobia which rubric do you look?

57
00:10:54,420 --> 00:11:00,920
You look in the additions? Who does not have the addition?

58
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:09,350
Everybody has my additions?
-We have them.

59
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:15,460
-Claustrophobia where do you look in Kent's Repertory?

60
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,500
-Fear of narrow places.

61
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:38,580
-It is two types of claustrophobia, the one is when the airplane closes doors

62
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:47,570
and then there is no way of going back. The airplane has no way of going back,

63
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:57,910
no way of stopping and getting out and they go into tremendous panic. This is the idea.

64
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:07,820
And there is another one which is fear for any closed place but there they know

65
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:15,670
they can go away, they can stop and open the door. They can tolerate it.

66
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,110
With elevator you can stop it.

67
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:55,980
It depends because if there is an executive director of a big firm that he has to travel

68
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:01,490
with the airplane and he never gets into the airplane and it's his life,

69
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,240
that's a severe form.

70
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,330
I have a case like that.

71
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,830
So you prescribe Lachesis? No.

72
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,230
What you prescribe? Causticum? Argentum nitricum?

73
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,250
-Yes.

74
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:32,500
-So the remedy starts with A.
-Arsenicum.

75
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:41,490
-Gelsemium.
-Argentum nitricum.

76
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:51,240
-Arnica.
-Aconite.

77
00:13:55,130 --> 00:14:12,070
-So let us see Argentum nitricum, how many? 21.

78
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:18,480
Causticum? Nobody.

79
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,730
Lachesis? Nobody.

80
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:39,740
What other remedies we said? Aconite. Who is Aconite? 9.

81
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:44,980
Gelsemium? 3.

82
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:50,570
Other remedies?
-Arnica.

83
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:56,260
-Who is in favor of Arnica? 2.

84
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,850
-Kali Arsenicum.

85
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:18,170
-Phosphorus. Any other remedy?

86
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,920
-Ambra grisea.

87
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,180
-Sophisticated.

88
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:52,180
You were thinking of Argentum nitricum also? Yes.

89
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:22,540
It is strange that I would not think of Argentum nitricum in that case at all.

90
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:56,440
-I failed.
-Yes but it's interesting.

91
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:15,930
It's interesting to see how you are thinking because it helps me also to help you.

92
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:24,910
The previous case I told you Calcarea was my thinking also.

93
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:30,830
Here I did not think of Argentum nitricum.

94
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:43,230
What I would like in this case, to make it an Argentum nitricum case,

95
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:49,490
I would like to have stressed some more keynotes.

96
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:56,080
Arg. nitricum has definitely claustrophobia and fear of the dead and desires company.

97
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:11,480
The worse heat is a very strong characteristic of Argentum nitricum

98
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:16,730
and the desire for sweets, usually I expect to see a very strong desire

99
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,980
when it is an Argentum nitricum.

100
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:27,170
The desire is strong and they will express it, they cannot even control it.

101
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:37,170
I expect also some desire for salt to be there, they have strong desire for sweets

102
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:40,120
and salt, quite strong.

103
00:18:54,100 --> 00:19:14,110
Gelsemium, what we don't like in this case to make it look like Gelsemium?

104
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,010
-Too vital.

105
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:33,670
-We have to have a vital remedy. This element is quite stressed in that case.

106
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:43,420
It can be Belladonna, it can be Strontium carbonicum.

107
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:54,080
They are vital people and which of these remedies is the most vital?

108
00:19:54,180 --> 00:20:02,380
The most violent in its reactions?

109
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:21,090
When we have a reaction it is quite strong the reaction and everything is intense?

110
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:28,750
-Aconite.

111
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:41,240
-Who thinks that the remedy which has the greatest violence in reactions?

112
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,400
Who thinks of Aconite?

113
00:20:51,400 --> 00:21:01,220
This is what we call the essence. You must not lose sight of that violence.

114
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:11,470
You see little things now will come to tally or not to tally but we must not lose sight of that.

115
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:14,720
Aconite has claustrophobia.

116
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:20,320
Is it fear in narrow places?
-Yes.

117
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:27,580
-Is it after fright?
-Sure.

118
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:37,140
-The primary remedy that you will think after an accident, after big fright...

119
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:42,550
it will be a different situation when there is...

120
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:48,570
Gelsemium was indicated after earthquakes quite frequently.

121
00:21:51,830 --> 00:22:15,460
That trembling, it's an exhaustion, there is a cowardice state. This does not appear here.

122
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:28,770
Palpitations from these, oh I'm going to faint and then fear of death, fear of dying

123
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:33,370
and then the claustrophobia running right through.

124
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:49,620
When this person was hit by the stimulus of the earthquake was an Aconite case before.

125
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:55,690
With the fear of entering...? If he was coming for claustrophobia to be able to travel,

126
00:22:55,790 --> 00:23:01,940
we would not perhaps have given Aconitum but after this stimulation

127
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:08,700
which it takes from the earthquake, the whole picture of Aconitum develops.

128
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:18,290
Aconitum can help such cases; it can help a case which is 5 years, 10 years suffering.

129
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:27,190
We are thinking of Aconitum on a short acting basis, where here this person

130
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:30,290
must have been an Aconitum person all along.

131
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:40,190
We hit the chronic state together with the acute state, if you say acute

132
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:42,690
because it is not an acute here.

133
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:52,030
It is this layer that was the fear of airplanes and on this same level

134
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:58,370
some other Aconite symptoms were added. So it makes a full picture of Aconite.

135
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:23,870
So I prescribed Aconite. What potency?
-10M, high.

136
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:29,710
-What potency did I prescribe?
-CM.

137
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:37,860
-I prescribed 50M. When I prescribe in these cases Aconitum,

138
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,600
I do not prescribe lower than 10M.

139
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:47,860
When I see a case, which I feel it is Aconitum, I better go high

140
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:55,710
and usually is 10M, 50M or CM.

141
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,860
-What's the reason for that?

142
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:13,260
-I have found out that it's a high frequency remedy, I cannot explain it.

143
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:20,120
Low potencies may not work at all or they may work for a short period of time.

144
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:38,190
Also if you prescribe Arnica in a case that you do have a real picture of Arnica,

145
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:41,540
you prescribe very high, you go 50M.

146
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:51,190
When you need Arnica after a shock, you go high and you will have

147
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:57,290
much more impressive results than you have with the 30's or 200.

148
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:10,530
We are not first aid prescribers. I consider you as constitutional prescribers.

149
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:19,770
If I was talking to first aid prescriber, I would say the highest you prescribe is Arnica 30.

150
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:25,710
But I tell you with the idea that you understand an Arnica case and you prescribe.

151
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:36,450
-Physical pathology in an Aconitum case?

152
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:44,450
-I don't think that it can exist such a situation.

153
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:52,100
When Aconitum is needed, I've never seen a physical pathology.

154
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,370
When the physical pathology has come, the Aconitum case has gone into Sulphur

155
00:26:56,470 --> 00:27:02,940
or it has gone into a deeper remedy already. But the time it is Aconitum,

156
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:07,190
it can go into deep pathology.

157
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:13,040
You will not find a deep pathology in Aconitum, they don't go together.

158
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:20,170
When I say deep pathology, I mean deep pathology,

159
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:24,030
I don't mean pathology on a superficial level.

160
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:36,780
-I would like to know what is against the Argentum nitricum?

161
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:51,020
-Not much. I said already what it is. The lack of heat in the Argentum nitricum,

162
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:56,930
there is a lot of heat, it's a person who is very much aggravated by heat,

163
00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:02,100
it cannot tolerate heat, which is not the case with that case.

164
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:14,450
Then there is strong desires for sweet and salty things, we do not see that in this case.

165
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:32,350
Then Argentum nitricum has fear of heights but I've told you not in an airplane,

166
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:35,610
it's not the case.

167
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:50,100
You will see fear of heights but if it's a little bit narrow

168
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:58,270
and there is no things to hold, it's impossible to go through it, the Argentum nitricum.

169
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:05,510
But you put him in an airplane and close the door, he feels secure that he can rest,

170
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,700
no problem looking down.

171
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:17,190
It's the fear coupled with the idea that he cannot hold and maybe he will lose his gait

172
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:23,430
and will fall. There is such fear which goes on inside.

173
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:29,400
If it is an impulsive person and builds the fear more and more, he goes at a certain moment

174
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,930
and stand in the middle of the pont.

175
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:38,040
I cannot go, somebody has to hold him and he will pass.

176
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:51,770
That is the Argentum nitricum situation which I would expect to find here.

177
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,170
These are automatic thinking of course.

178
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:10,070
Because there are some symptoms of Lachesis as well here, all the night aggravation

179
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:16,170
and when she enters into sleep but nobody has mentioned of course.

180
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:34,660
Also worse summer is a strong symptom for Lachesis. Do you remember it?

181
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:39,420
You could have taken it.

182
00:30:52,890 --> 00:31:00,090
This person you want to know what she said when he came back? Yes.

183
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:16,560
She came on 17th of March 82, it means in a month time about.

184
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:29,710
The first thing she says is that generally I did very well, especially the last days.

185
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:53,800
The first few days there was no change and then for 4-5 days a tremendous tachycardia,

186
00:31:53,900 --> 00:32:02,890
palpitations which I had to lie down and since that time I feel quite well.

187
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,140
No palpitations at all, no numbness.

188
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:24,640
The fears are just a shadow of fear, it goes away immediately. Sleep much better.

189
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:37,630
As soon as I lie down, I fall asleep, I wake up in the morning, no problem.

190
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:52,140
And there is a curious symptom, which has come up, very interesting for the psychology.

191
00:32:54,150 --> 00:33:04,260
She says she has a nightmare now, every second night, that she is in an airplane

192
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:17,270
which is falling down. Why that is interesting?

193
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:26,340
See says I'm very calm and she says an expression, which sometimes we hear it

194
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:31,260
when we have hit the right remedy, she says my husband I changed so much

195
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:38,530
that he does not recognize me, I'm another person.

196
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:50,420
With Aconitum, you hit as a chronic case and I would like the psychologist to tell me

197
00:33:50,520 --> 00:34:05,520
his opinion about that nightmare. What it shows? Or anybody who wants to comment on that?

198
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:18,030
There is a nightmare, every second night she said, that she is in an airplane that falls.

199
00:34:49,170 --> 00:35:02,090
-The dreams is maybe the fears coming out. She is resolving it.

200
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,680
-Yes she is getting over this.

201
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:20,480
-The same idea everybody has, also I feel the same. She is now able to confront the fear,

202
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:33,300
she is able in an unconscious level still to really come into contact with that fear

203
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:41,610
and sort it out. We don't have further information because she has not come anymore.

204
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:49,740
Maybe after a few years she will come back and we will enquire about that fear.

205
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:56,070
I believe that within a few months perhaps she is travelling to the United States.

206
00:35:56,830 --> 00:36:00,330
She is entering an airplane.

207
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:19,820
That I do not know. That's another explanation.

208
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:29,330
Aconite is listed on a nightmare falling from a high place.

209
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:35,970
In this case it's a confirmation that the remedy is correct

210
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:41,150
but also the other explanation can hold true.

211
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:51,640
You see how beautiful these things occurred.

212
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:55,740
I feel that really it's mathematics.

213
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:38,730
The fear of entering in the airplane and the strength of the reaction is part of it.
