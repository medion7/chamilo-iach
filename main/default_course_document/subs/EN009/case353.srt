1
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:24,460
-And there during the course I received Nat. mur.

2
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,880
because I was running from one catastrophe into the next.

3
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,310
I fell and bruised in hands and knees and feet.

4
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,550
-Where, in which course?
-Here in Alonissos in May.

5
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,550
-You're talking about last May?

6
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:51,380
-But her mother died last week. One week before she came in May.

7
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:58,070
-After falling and bruising myself I got a sun stroke and went to the water

8
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,700
and it was hard to get out anymore, one thing after the other happened.

9
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,300
-She got a stroke?
-A sun stroke.

10
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:10,120
-And she could not get out of the water?
-Yes.

11
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:18,280
I came out of the water and the Cuban guy assisted me and afterwards I got Nat. mur.

12
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:29,800
and after I took this remedy a lot of hatred came up.

13
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:39,190
I hated my father all my life like anything and my mother was only living for him.

14
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:47,770
My mother had her first stroke 5 years ago and the remaining 5 years until she died

15
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:53,850
I somehow subordinated under my father and cared for my mother.

16
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:06,360
And I always tried to help her out with what I had. She was paralyzed...

17
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:16,020
-Is she a medical doctor?
-Practitioner.

18
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:22,180
Whatever I did was under the intention to help her.

19
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,720
Every time I turned against my father, he let it out on her.

20
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:34,020
If you want to bring somebody who is paralyzed into some nursing home,

21
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,560
you have to pay between 5-6.000 DM per month.

22
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,170
Today I understand that my father, who had been self-employed all his life,

23
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:49,500
was afraid from starting paying money for something like that

24
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:55,440
because what he had was what he saved all his life and he was afraid to spend it.

25
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,470
And what caused all this now was, after I came to the island this time,

26
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:08,700
meaning now I saved this dog, you saw me outside with a young dog, the Alaskan dog.

27
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,690
He was tight down behind a house, he was beginning to get ill

28
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:20,920
and the reason why I did this and slowly I drew the dog close to me was that I had understood

29
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:25,540
that my father lost his motivation for life.

30
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:32,840
I know he is going to leave life soon until he finds a new motivation to return to life again

31
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:41,000
and so I had figured that if I bring him this dog, I might give him new motivation, to continue living.

32
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:46,390
-How old is her father?
-85.

33
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:51,790
Since my mother died, he was water in his lungs, one of his heart valves doesn't function anymore

34
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:54,360
and you can just watch him ...

35
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:59,290
-But does she still hate him?

36
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:09,230
-No, I've been working so much with this subject and I really left it.

37
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,890
-Left the hate she means.

38
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:17,140
-Yes and this morning I received a fax that he sold the house

39
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:25,710
and now on my way coming to the Academy this afternoon, after having cried all morning

40
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:33,900
and all noon I suddenly realized what my point is in this whole thing.

41
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:41,460
Everything I ever earned or saved for myself, I lost repeatedly or had to give away

42
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:49,020
and I somehow secretly had hoped that he would leave at least something for me

43
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:56,060
and now he also sold the house; so it's really this financial point that I'm working right now.

44
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:03,210
That's one of the points and it's a point that really runs through the family since generations.

45
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:10,710
For example his sister who used to live in East Germany had his OK in general

46
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:18,380
to care take of his possessions there but without him knowing it, she sold his house

47
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,720
which he was owning there and he almost went crazy when he heard of it.

48
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:29,120
This is an issue which has been running through my entire life constantly.

49
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:36,120
Always the issue of loss and him, feeling responsible that he had not taken well enough care

50
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,070
of his heritage.

51
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:46,120
And he constantly feels responsible for anyone in the family who is at weak point

52
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:53,060
to somehow support this person and so now he wants to buy the house of his mother.

53
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:00,040
All his life he had said, whenever I leave the house, I live in now.

54
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:04,810
The only way I'm going to leave it is with my feet being carried out first.

55
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:13,630
-Which he changed it now because he sold it or did he sell it with the idea that he keeps it

56
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,810
until his death?

57
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:21,480
-I don't know exactly but when he bought it, it was his intention to live there until death.

58
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:29,130
My physical feeling right now is everything is gone. My mind says,

59
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:34,460
it's nonsense but my entire body goes to pieces.

60
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,310
It's like a part of me I have no control of it.

61
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,720
-Is she trembling?
-Yes.

62
00:06:52,980 --> 00:07:02,130
-How did she feel before this information came in?

63
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:08,890
-I was so happy, so incredibly happy, ever since I took Calcarea phosphorica.

64
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:15,130
So maybe if you want to know about my remedies, the last remedy I took was Calc. phos.

65
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,380
-When?

66
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:23,880
-I prescribed for myself 5 weeks ago. I took a C12 which lasted for one week,

67
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:28,980
I took it 4 times all together and a C30 one week ago.

68
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:36,710
-She had some other problems when she took Calc. phos.?

69
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:41,040
-Yes, I took it because I can't really study. I was studying all my life

70
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:46,130
but I always have the feeling I can't memorize things, I can not keep it in my head,

71
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,820
as other people can.

72
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,950
There is always a barrier, the moment I need it, nothing comes out

73
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:58,210
and when I'm really relaxed things just pouring out of me, one after the other.

74
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:03,700
But I have to be in a certain state of joy and then suddenly I know things,

75
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,140
I don't even know where I got them from.

76
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:10,090
There is so much there, just it's a certain combination in my head

77
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:16,640
which makes things come out suddenly, quickly and come one after the other

78
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,770
and I even pass them, even though I was so way behind before.

79
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:29,680
-And Calc. phos. helped her to have a state of mind which is clear.

80
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:33,080
On what symptoms she took Calc. phos.?

81
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:40,000
-I had started eating bacon like some crazy person every day and that I could not study.

82
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,430
Due to these two symptoms, I took it.

83
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,520
Before that just after the death of my mother it was Nat. mur.

84
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,680
I go through the remedies backwards now.

85
00:08:49,780 --> 00:09:02,190
The Nat. mur. was 1M twice all together and before it was Ignatia 1M.

86
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,110
-That's all?

87
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:14,090
-No, I once had pyelonephritis, 3 years ago, first I treated with Sarsaparilla

88
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:19,160
but I stopped taking it I had strong cramps in my right leg and then I received a remedy

89
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,270
which I don't know which one.

90
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:30,030
I also once had Naja C200, I had Lycopodium all the way up to 10M

91
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,920
and Lycopodium didn't exactly help me

92
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:40,110
but it assisted me in getting a very deep understanding of communication with others.

93
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:50,440
Before that I did a remedy proving on my own. I took Mercury for almost half a year.

94
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,020
-On purpose, she took it to have a proving?

95
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:04,180
-It was a mixture, on the one side I was very curious about this remedy

96
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:12,510
and on the other side I had holes in my rectum which closed and healed with this remedy

97
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:17,350
and I believe without the assistance of Mercury I would not have been able

98
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,190
to take care of my mother at this time.

99
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,860
-She has fistula in the rectum?

100
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:34,510
-The rectal situation was she had fissures of the anus, she had fistulas,

101
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:40,590
she had strong itching and right behind the anus inside

102
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:53,170
there were two big holes through the mucosa in the rectum.

103
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:59,030
These holes she had had since her first menstruation and it all disappeared with Mercury

104
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:02,450
and some of the hemorrhoids disappeared but not all.

105
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:10,600
Eight years ago I received Arsenicum 1M on three following days

106
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:16,090
because at that time I had a sensation as if my entire body was burning,

107
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:21,170
I was overwhelmed with everything that was happening around me.

108
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:26,840
For 3/4 of a year I had told nobody about that state I was in, I was running through the streets

109
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:32,540
of the town every night and the condition I was in was so terrible.

110
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:41,450
The entire body was burning like fire inside.

111
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:50,180
And when I closed my eyes, it was as if all pictures had been cut into pieces

112
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,450
and for 3/4 of the year I did not sleep one night

113
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:01,100
and then finally somebody gave me Arsenicum 1M three doses and within three days,

114
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,610
this state had vanished.

115
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:12,430
After that there was so much I had to deal with, my father, my mother, my practice a job on the side,

116
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:16,930
earn my living, my partner, there was so much going on

117
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:24,760
and so I prescribed for myself Arsenicum 10M and immediately after taking the 10M

118
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:29,690
I knew now the whole problem is down to the physical level.

119
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:35,360
Within a few days first I had the cystitis and then a pyelonephritis.

120
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:42,200
And after that I skipped one remedy, that was after the pyelonephritis.

121
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:47,100
I prescribed Silica for myself and that was beautiful.

122
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,520
I took it for one year and it helped me so much.

123
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,850
-Silica what potency?
-Up to 10M.

124
00:12:53,950 --> 00:13:02,590
-For 1 year every day Silica helped her? But never closed this fissure?

125
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:09,640
-Starting with C12, the itching, the fissures and the hemorrhoids now were healed with Calc. phos.

126
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:18,560
and Silica helped me to really straighten my life, to go through things to find my goal,

127
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:24,650
to set myself straight and manage everything, new stuff, computers the course here,

128
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,430
my practice, whatever.

129
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:31,230
Before it used to be so that once I was in something I could work like a machine

130
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:37,650
but until I really started there were a lot of fears and insecurities.

131
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:42,570
With Silica it went really beautiful. I just straighten out and did whatever I wanted to do

132
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,410
and managed very well.

133
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:48,590
-Which of these remedies she consider it acted best?

134
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:56,170
-It was a development and concerning my feeling for life it was Calc. phos.

135
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:03,580
The feeling that came back was like a feeling I've known before 6 weeks vacation in Greece

136
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,190
and this feeling I did not have in the last 25 years.

137
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,660
-For 25 years?
-I have not had this feeling.

138
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,220
-Not even under Silica?
-No.

139
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:30,030
-The reason why I didn't have this feeling for the last 25 years has to do with my life partner,

140
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,370
whom I met 25 years ago.

141
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:36,280
Before I met him I was a wild person.

142
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:40,950
I did whatever I felt like doing, I lived in different countries all around the world

143
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:44,780
and always did what I felt was best for me.

144
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,280
Once I got to know him I did exactly what my mother had done.

145
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:56,190
I subordinated, I assimilated into his life system and even though I was defending myself

146
00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:01,550
and trying to go against it, I had to suffer for 25 years.

147
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:07,390
Then 10 years ago actually we officially separated but we always kept playing pretending

148
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:12,970
we would still belong together and half a day we still work together.

149
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:22,110
What he never forgave me was that even though I left his life, I stayed in the shop.

150
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:28,300
And so from then on he said, whatever we earned, whatever we built up together is mine.

151
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:36,380
And so I told him I couldn't care less and I just set my own practice

152
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,360
and he keeps telling me what you did in formal times it was just jumping on to wave

153
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:45,700
and going along with the wave and your practitioner stuff now

154
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:51,960
you just jump on to some wave, although he really supports it in the meantime.

155
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,120
That's one of my basic structures I always fight against my father, just to prove to him

156
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,050
that I can accomplish something too.

157
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,220
-How is her thirst?

158
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:14,670
-Last time not so much, if I don't remind myself to drink, I don't feel any thirst at all.

159
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:17,580
-But she came with the bottle here.

160
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:24,160
-Because I was shaking so much but it was more a mind thing and after Calc. phos.

161
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:29,250
I developed a lot of thirst, I drunk enormous amounts.

162
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,370
-And still drinks?

163
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:38,250
-Yes but I feel that it's reducing and I can also feel that the effect of Calc. phos. ended

164
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:41,200
when I received the fax from my father today.

165
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,170
-Does she drink milk?

166
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:51,730
-No, I decided to stop drinking milk 6 years ago because I had a blood test

167
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:58,070
and this test showed that I'm highly allergic to milk, which showed itself that

168
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:04,820
for example my entire head fell as if it was burning and I reacted to all kinds of milk products

169
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:10,400
milk, cheese and so on; also to nuts and green peppers and things like that.

170
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:16,490
This burning in my head and also a burning sensation in my shoulders alongside

171
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:21,550
with the feeling that everything is contracting, I can feel now again

172
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:26,880
and I can feel that Calc. phos. is still working a little bit

173
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:32,480
because there is still some clarity in my mind which allows me to think in spite of this.

174
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:37,960
-But she has this stiffness here?
-It's starting again like that.

175
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:42,900
It was really massive at the time when I took the Arsenicum 10M;

176
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:50,470
at that time everything felt like it was just one burning nodded area

177
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:55,970
which was working back and forth and side and I could hardly move anymore.

178
00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:01,650
I also had a whiplash syndrome 20 years ago on this area on the left here.

179
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:06,730
The effect of the whiplash syndrome eased with the Silica, almost completely.

180
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:11,560
-Now at this moment does she feel anything on this area?

181
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,480
-Just beginning to burn again.

182
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:22,650
-Is sensitive this area to cold, to drafts?
-I used to be very cold at the times of Silica;

183
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:28,760
if my feet were cold up to the half of my lower limbs, I would get ill immediately.

184
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:38,250
Now my feet are cold but it's not as bad, I'm not that cold, I don't get ill.

185
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:44,140
In former times it would always happen that my feet were cold and my lower limbs were cold.

186
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,900
What I could do for years is scrape off the pus of my tonsils

187
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,110
and the chill the coldness was on my back, going down to my buttocks,

188
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:56,270
then into the legs and I was ill.

189
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,180
-And then she was ill?
-Yes.

190
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:13,990
-Does now she want to eat bacon again?

191
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:21,070
-16 years ago she was a vegetarian for 4 years but she stopped being a vegetarian

192
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:26,170
and now she has the feeling she could eat bacon but she wouldn't do it.

193
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:32,070
She was eating bacon a couple of months ago but now she doesn't eat it because

194
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:39,830
she just feels eating bacon is a strange thing. She wouldn't do it anymore.

195
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,990
-But that means she does not want, she has no desire.

196
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:50,820
-I have the desire, I could eat it, the desire is there but the mind says,

197
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:55,430
eating bacon is somehow wired, I won't do it.

198
00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:03,490
-Still I do not get an answer when I ask about these burning feelings here.

199
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:06,890
Is she affected by any coldness?

200
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:13,730
-Not specifically this area, in general I'm sensitive to cold and to draft.

201
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:20,330
If my kidney area gets cold and I feel the draft there, I panic immediately.

202
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,990
-If she feels a draft in the kidney area.

203
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:36,490
Does she have any predominant fear at the moment?

204
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:41,670
-The first thing it came to my mind now was everything is gone again.

205
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:47,070
-But this is a financial insecurity?

206
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:50,250
-One part is financial and the other is emotional.

207
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:57,090
-But the emotional what has to do with losing the house?

208
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:02,730
She was emotionally connected with the house, that's what she means?

209
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:08,730
-No, my mother was my home and since my mother died I tried to make my father

210
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:11,330
and the house into my home.

211
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,960
-Does she have the feeling that she is unfortunate?

212
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:24,800
-No, my basic feeling is that I'm a lucky person and whatever I start, I will manage somehow.

213
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:31,070
And I worked so much in these last years, it would be equivalent of three people's work.

214
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:43,970
-But the fact that she lost repeatedly, does it give you the feeling that you are unfortunate?

215
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:49,710
-No, it's more like something that just belongs to me. My grand parents lost everything repeatedly,

216
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:54,720
my father lost everything repeatedly, I also have lost repeatedly.

217
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:59,300
It's something more like a back pack, I'm carrying it around all the time.

218
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,120
-How many times she had a sun stroke? Only one?

219
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:15,700
-As children we were in the sun for long hours but it never really did good.

220
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,530
It was more or less just being together with others.

221
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,120
-Does she avoid sun now?

222
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:24,550
-No, I don't avoid it but I can not sit under it for hours.

223
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:40,720
And if I was in the sun, afterwards anxiety feeling arises and my entire system is affected.

224
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:53,120
Maybe this information is important to understand better my sensitivity to the sun.

225
00:22:53,220 --> 00:23:00,710
18 years ago I had a meningitis and this meningitis I developed because my partner

226
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:05,630
and his mother were planning to travel to the USA.

227
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:12,030
3 weeks before I had really intensely hoped that I would come down with something

228
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:18,200
that would keep them from going and 3 weeks later I was in the hospital with meningitis.

229
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:22,790
So they canceled their trip, stayed with me until I was healthy and then

230
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:29,970
they dragged me on to a ship here to Greece and since then I actually don't like sun anymore.

231
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,050
-She has a regular stool or she is constipated?

232
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:41,450
-At the moment when I'm traveling at the beginning I'm always constipated.

233
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:47,450
After a couple of days I have normal stool. With Silica I developed normal stool

234
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:51,050
before Silica I had diarrhea constantly.

235
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:04,710
And every time I'm excited or there is something ahead of me which I will manage

236
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:12,550
but at the moment I think I will not be able to manage, I have quick urge to go to the toilet

237
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:15,140
and I have a stool once quickly.

238
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:21,390
-But not a diarrhea?
-No.

239
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:02,520
-What is the first rubric that you have to take in this case?

240
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,580
-Ailment from grief?

241
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:33,160
-Ailments from sun?
-Ailments because of bad news.

242
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:57,400
-Ailments from bad news, sudden news and she was overwhelmed and this is the rubric,

243
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:04,340
show me the rubric. Which are the remedies?

244
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:17,050
Gelsemium is the main remedy and Calcarea. Does somebody has the original Kent?

245
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:17,730
-Yes.

246
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,900
-Show me the remedies that original Kent has?

247
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:37,150
It just raised Gelsemium.
This is the same.

248
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:39,850
-More or less.

249
00:26:42,070 --> 00:27:01,900
-Almost exact. This is the first. What are you going to do?

250
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:12,300
Is this a case of Gelsemium trembling in the beginning?

251
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,910
And now she is still crying outside of course.

252
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:22,890
But in the beginning she was affected very much. The organism was affected.

253
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:29,990
I don't think she has any control of what is going on inside. It's too much.

254
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:38,810
The bad news are overwhelming. But this is the rubric you have to be looking first.

255
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:49,900
And then show the other rubrics that you have taken and now I' ll tell you.

256
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:59,550
Ailments from bad news, difficult studying, ulceration in the rectum, fissure, fistula,

257
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:20,410
itching, thirst less, pain burning, cervical region, bacon desire, draft of air aggravates...

258
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:34,390
No, this is not correct but anyhow leave it there, it doesn't matter.

259
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:38,670
Exposure to the sun, excitement, inner trembling...

260
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:40,180
Show me the analysis.

261
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:50,980
With these symptoms we see the first remedy comes is Gelsemium. You changed it?

262
00:28:55,410 --> 00:29:01,990
-When you take the bad news in the 4th degree, Gelsemium take it to the 3rd degree it's Calcarea.

263
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:22,570
-OK, Calcarea, Phosphorus, Gelsemium.

264
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:31,760
-I drive with her every day and have some contact with her and she complains

265
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,750
that she constantly has a sour taste.

266
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:48,390
She just now said my entire body is sour and so she says my entire body

267
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:55,580
and my taste is sour and besides the craving for bacon, she always have a craving for pork.

268
00:29:56,570 --> 00:30:02,140
And when she received the news this morning, we were standing together, she was not trembling,

269
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,440
she cried immediately and broke down.

270
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,900
-Concerning this physical feeling I'd like to add something,

271
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,740
it is as if a system in me is broken down.

272
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:20,640
It was the same feeling when my mother died and now I have the feeling

273
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,580
that my father is going to leave.

274
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,150
-You mean he is going to die.

275
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,400
What time she received the news?

276
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:42,910
-After breakfast about 8 o'clock.

277
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:05,690
-Did you ever take Calcarea carb.? No.

278
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:11,240
Do you perspire during sleep here?

279
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,650
-I used to never perspire a lot, since I took Cal. phos.

280
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:23,420
I perspire in the night on my back and on my chest and it's more towards morning around 5 a.m.

281
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:31,910
And also 3 days before my menses come, I perspire so that the entire bed is wet.

282
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:36,090
-Perspiration before menses, can you try?

283
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,370
Calcarea comes quite strongly.

284
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:03,870
The question that we have to ask at this moment is this.

285
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:09,940
She was doing very well with Cal. phos.

286
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:23,150
Also this is a case where you will see the layers. She needed several remedies, which were correct.

287
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:30,370
She took Arsenicum, it was the correct remedy at this moment.

288
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:44,360
She was for 9 months going on and could continue that state of Arsenicum for 5-10 years.

289
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:47,870
She needed Arsenicum.

290
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:59,960
And also Silica acted curatively. So she needed Silica and finally she needed Calc. phos.

291
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:09,870
She was fortunate or her organism is strong enough to give out clear pictures.

292
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:22,030
This craving bacon you see how strongly she describes and saved her life.

293
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:31,510
What we have here? A case that goes like that.

294
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:44,450
Arsenicum, Silica, Calc. phos. which are not mixed so much and underneath Calc. phos.

295
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:47,690
is possible that there is Cal.car.

296
00:33:48,450 --> 00:34:01,120
This is the question and while she is doing very well here and this layer is gone

297
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:07,980
and she is going to develop this layer of Cal. carb., she receives a shock here.

298
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:14,770
She has not received yet Calc. car., she received a shock on these layers.

299
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:21,370
Maybe underneath there is Natrum carb. even.

300
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:34,390
The shock has different possibilities. Either to bring back the previous state,

301
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:45,870
one possibility, second possibility to create a new state this is Nat. mur. or Ignatia

302
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:54,960
or Staphysagria, whatever. Third possibility is to make this level more prominent.

303
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:01,960
This is what we have to solve and to decide upon.

304
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:11,710
What is going to decide? What is the deciding factor?

305
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:25,720
-This insecurity is since the separation lasting for 10 years now.

306
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:33,710
My mother was, as I would described it today, delusion religious.

307
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:42,010
She never understood why we didn't marry and every Christmas she wrote a letter to me and said,

308
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:45,410
my greatest wish for Christmas would be marriage.

309
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:50,730
That's why I remained in this relationship.

310
00:35:53,960 --> 00:36:00,290
-Her greatest wish was to remain this marriage, is that the idea?

311
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:06,480
-The mother's greatest wish was that her daughter would marry the partner.

312
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:10,990
They have been together for years and years but they did not want to marry

313
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:15,160
but because it was the greatest wish of the mother, our patient decided

314
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:19,170
to remain in the relationship although it was very difficult.

315
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:26,370
Due to this about 12 years ago I blackmailed him more or less and said,

316
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:34,420
either we marry or I leave. But it was not my wish, it was her wish.

317
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:09,380
-You see also it is too early to decide whether a remedy like Calc. carb.

318
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:16,140
which is quite a deep remedy is really manifesting its picture;

319
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:26,460
it's too early to decide whether it will need this sensitivity to coldness,

320
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:36,980
perhaps more than she described, we need the desire for eggs or sweets,

321
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:41,810
we need the perspiration.

322
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:51,990
-I have had this craving for eggs and I had times where I ate up to three soft boiled eggs per day.

323
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:58,120
And when this bacon thing came up, I really broke through a barrier, at that time,

324
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:01,710
when I started to eat bacon because usually at home I never eat meat

325
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:03,980
because my partner is vegetarian.

326
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:12,060
And now I'm at the point which after Silica I can really live my own things again.

327
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:22,460
-Is it true that, one of the doctors remarked, you said you feel you're going crazy?

328
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,550
There is this fear, you may lose your mind?

329
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:33,730
-Before Calc. phos. this was true and with Arsenicum it was there for years.

330
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,960
-Did it cross your mind at all?

331
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:48,390
-It is interrupted by this burning and the constriction in my neck and my shoulders and

332
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:53,660
in the head; everything closes down and I can not feel anymore.

333
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,320
-Thank you.

334
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:06,730
What's the remedy?

335
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,060
-Phosphorus?

336
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:29,230
-You want Phosphorus but you have no thirst?

337
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:35,400
-At the moment I'd have half bottle of the water.

338
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,440
-No, no.

339
00:39:52,890 --> 00:40:03,320
It is the teaching that we had in the morning, when I said, when there is a relapse

340
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,410
what do we mean by relapse?

341
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:12,320
We mean that we may have back the symptomatology or the keynotes

342
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:17,260
on which we have prescribed the previous remedy, which has acted well.

343
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:21,160
The previous remedy that has acted well was Calc. phos.

344
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:35,400
Now she says, one keynote is that she really wants bacon, desire is there.

345
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:46,580
The other keynote is, Calc. phos. has a critical point on the cervical region,

346
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:54,800
where they feel constricted and this constriction makes the thoughts not possible,

347
00:40:54,900 --> 00:41:06,240
the reflection goes. It is as if they are living in a limbo, neither positive, nor negative.

348
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:15,720
No thoughts, no feelings, they are clogged here; both thoughts and feelings for Calc. phos.

349
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:21,410
seem that something holds them there and they can not flow.

350
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:24,900
Feelings can not flow, thoughts can not flow.

351
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:35,320
And Cal. phos. is one of the main remedies for bad news.

352
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:43,510
Bad news affect, bring a state of Calc. phos.

353
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:54,990
She had very good reaction from Calc. phos. We have back 2 keynotes from Calc. phos.

354
00:41:55,090 --> 00:42:13,570
together with a new situation, which again fits with Calc. phos.

355
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:26,500
So the remedy that she has to take at this moment is Calc. phos. 200.

356
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:35,650
What she described here, she says this thing here makes me having no feelings and no thoughts,

357
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:44,800
I can not think, I'm crazy because I have no thoughts, this is typical of Calc. phos. situation.

358
00:42:47,500 --> 00:43:03,010
You can not go away, you have to take a dose of 200 and come down to earth again.

359
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:14,160
-If it's interesting for you I could describe what else has happened when taking Cal.phos.

360
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:19,740
because it was really the theme of my life when I took the C12.

361
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:25,070
I took a C12 every week, it actually lasted for one week each time

362
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:28,740
and what came back was this Phosphorus part in me.

363
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,320
I was almost like I used to be when I was young.

364
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:39,810
Almost careless, light, joyful, laughing and after 4 weeks about this Calcarea part,

365
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:47,670
finally struck, for the time in my life I got the feeling that I have ground beneath my feet again.

366
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:53,490
It was a feeling as if my body changed from before being almost immaterial

367
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:57,670
and invisible down to becoming very material.

368
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:03,240
And in the mornings when I woke I was almost angry about this feeling

369
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:08,240
because it was as if I had lost one aspect of my life and after about one week

370
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:15,330
these two elements started to combine with each other and so I had flexibility together

371
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:20,020
with stability and that really made me incredibly happy.

372
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:33,910
-Therefore I would suggest actually, looking at her, because she cried quite a lot

373
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:43,830
and this crying you can't say it was releasing the tension inside and I can see her laughing now.

374
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:52,260
I would suggest that she will not take the remedy today, you wait until tomorrow.

375
00:44:53,020 --> 00:45:03,250
See if do not by themselves come to balance and if they don't or become worse

376
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:08,500
you can not sleep etc. and it becomes worse, then it is better...

377
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:17,080
Because it is too early to know, maybe the previous situation, the previous remedy

378
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:21,090
can still be acting, not being antidoted.

379
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:27,080
So you just wait, don't be in a hurry to take the remedy

380
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:33,510
but the remedy most probably is Calc. phos.

381
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:43,940
You are blessed with a good constitution, it's very important.

382
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:53,760
The remedies that you produce like this makes...clear remedies produce clear pictures

383
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:56,690
shows a good constitution.

384
00:45:58,430 --> 00:46:02,910
-The complains were mainly on the mental-emotional level and they were very intense,

385
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:10,340
very severe, so I would have tend to give at least 1M or higher.

386
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:18,510
-It seems that her organism is reacting so well in lower potencies that going a jump

387
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:21,580
from 30 to 200 is already a big jump.

388
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:28,250
I was thinking whether we should stay still on 30 and maybe we'll do that

389
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:37,020
before we'll go to 200; because her organism reacted so well in 12C.

390
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:44,610
That means the remedy was dead right, the organism was on Calc. phos. exactly.

391
00:46:54,850 --> 00:47:02,020
-I would like us to hear what happened with the case yesterday when we said

392
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:09,580
that she must wait before taking the remedy to see how she is today and then we will decide.

393
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,260
So I will ask her how she is today.

394
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:18,590
-I cried a lot yesterday, still and then I went for a long walk with Adam.

395
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:25,430
We went down and we both had huge portion of ice-cream and after that I already felt better

396
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:34,510
and then tonight I slept very well and the feeling this morning is...

397
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:39,750
Yesterday when I got the message, I felt as if somebody had bitten me over the head

398
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:45,850
with a frying pan and this morning 3/4 of the frying pan are gone.

399
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:51,360
-Also laughing and she is quite happy actually.

400
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:08,750
-And you know this feeling of soreness in my body and the sour taste in my mouth

401
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:16,270
which occurred after I had received the message, it's got relieved a lot through the crying.

402
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:23,450
And usually if I drink black tea in the morning, I then have the feeling as if all minerals

403
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:25,600
have left my body for the day.

404
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:30,690
Now I feel balanced, the minerals are there and they are in my body.

405
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:38,550
-Very good, so can you imagine if we gave the remedy, she would report this and

406
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:41,760
we would say, ah the remedy did very well.

407
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:49,520
Or if you have given the wrong remedy, maybe you had some kind of a proving.

408
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:57,690
This is quite a good state, very happy.

409
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:10,170
This is what we call placebo effect, you don't even have to call it placebo effect

410
00:49:10,270 --> 00:49:19,090
because the moment that a person is under such a shock, it's natural to react

411
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:28,090
and it will be much worse if she had kept everything inside and presented herself

412
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:40,360
in front of you with a face still and unexpressive, without showing her emotions.

413
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:47,890
It would be much worse and you will have to fear that she will develop eventually

414
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:50,690
quite a symptomatology.

415
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:59,920
The fact that she cried, it's a natural reaction to such a disaster

416
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:07,170
and the organism gets over due to the fact her organism was functioning well,

417
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:11,020
due to the Cal. phos. she has taken before.
