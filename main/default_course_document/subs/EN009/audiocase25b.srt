1
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:34,600
You remember? Sulphur, possibility of Medorrhinum, then Lycopodium.

2
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:52,810
Because of different reasons until he said that he is much worse in the cold, wet weather.

3
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:59,060
And if it is cold, wet weather, forget about Sulphur.

4
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:17,650
-I like to exercise and sweat.

5
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:21,070
-You feel better then?

6
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:29,650
-I used to, not any longer. Running or walking.

7
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,070
-Now you cannot do it?

8
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:39,230
-Now I feel the heartbeat, this feeling of my heart in the body.

9
00:01:49,580 --> 00:02:02,150
Now I feel depressed and I cry very often. I can't control it.

10
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:10,560
I feel that that medicine that they had given me, I can't take it because then I feel my heart

11
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:16,870
and my body were stronger.

12
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:27,070
-The crying comes because of suffering, of pain or it comes for different reasons?

13
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:42,910
-I believe it's a mix because sometimes I feel sorry for myself and I feel sorry for my son.

14
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:53,450
-And some other times you can be crying because you see a film in the TV?

15
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:59,080
-Yes, all my life has been like that.

16
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:15,030
But that's very controlled, at home I know I can do it but never officially, never outside.

17
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:23,700
Sometimes in movies I may have difficulties but then I think of something else.

18
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:38,950
I felt it was that. Today I can talk about that, even to my students.

19
00:03:54,490 --> 00:04:07,610
I don't try to stop myself when I'm crying because I feel it's safe.

20
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:10,440
-You really feel better after the crying?

21
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,460
-Yes.

22
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,360
What symptom we are looking in the Repertory now?

23
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:37,280
Here we have a good symptom of a man who cries and feels better after crying.

24
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:56,610
So this how you find it? Weeping ameliorates. Which remedies are?

25
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:27,710
Page 93. Anacardium, Colchicum, Cyclamen, Graphites, Phosphorus...

26
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:37,970
-That has changed. Normally I've been drinking a lot.

27
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:48,220
Now when I was sweating that has changed. Now I drink mostly in the evening,

28
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:53,130
1 1/2 lit in the evening.

29
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:59,880
-Just water?

30
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:12,970
-Yes.

31
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:33,380
Thirsty in the evening. Look.

32
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:46,630
Cyclamen is a remedy that looks like Pulsatilla.

33
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:54,660
Can this person be Pulsatilla?

34
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:08,070
Because of the crying could he be Pulsatilla?

35
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:13,050
-He is so cold.

36
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:20,960
-Yes, he is very cold to be Pulsatilla and we don't have any other symptom to support

37
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:30,140
Pulsatilla description, apart from crying. So because somebody is crying is not Pulsatilla.

38
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:56,040
-(?) Mixed with water.

39
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:36,370
-Have you been feeling good inside the sea and sea baths?.

40
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:41,800
Have you noticed some amelioration of your condition if you are in the sea?

41
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,120
-No.

42
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,540
-Do you like to bath here?

43
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,210
-No, it's too cold.

44
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:51,370
-Even in Mediterranean?

45
00:09:51,470 --> 00:10:17,540
-Yes it's too cold but in the Indian Ocean, in Kenya it was OK but even there it wasn't warm enough.

46
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,790
You see how cold he is? He cannot be Pulsatilla.

47
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:33,620
Pulsatilla would say I enjoy going into cold sea. It is exactly the opposite.

48
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:40,790
Why did I ask again whether there is amelioration in the sea?

49
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:54,220
Because I saw Medorrhinum has amelioration from weeping. And Lycopodium also.

50
00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:05,540
-Are you a restless person or you can sit for some time in a chair?

51
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:11,620
-I used to be restless but now I can sit and be.

52
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:21,460
I asked this question thinking of Rhus tox, maybe this is a Rhus tox case

53
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:28,200
or an Arsenicum case with so much coldness.

54
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:41,290
But he is not a restless person, he is sitting there quite quietly but I put this question in

55
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:51,040
case he tries to hold himself back and say I'm very restless but I now I try to sit quietly.

56
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:44,960
-I don't like to go out, I like to be at home.

57
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:52,370
-Do you like to eat something? There is a special desire?

58
00:12:52,470 --> 00:13:11,120
-It used to be (?) or meat but now I've started to eat fruits. It has changed.

59
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:17,120
Not very much.

60
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,960
-Would you like some meat with some fat?

61
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:30,200
-Yes I love that.

62
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:40,320
Now I reduce that because of the diet but I love it.

63
00:13:51,560 --> 00:14:01,110
Yes, my wife too but she loves fat as well.

64
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:06,470
-What about eggs? You like eggs?

65
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:18,360
-Not very much, scrambled eggs I think I can bear because I don't like eggs.

66
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:24,020
I think I don't like them because my wife used to make them every morning.

67
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:30,140
-Salt do you like?

68
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,600
-Yes, I used to take a lot of salt but I've learned that it doesn't help,

69
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:40,080
so I don't use very much now.

70
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:51,470
-When you wake up in the morning are you refreshed from sleep or unrefreshed?

71
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:59,090
-I'm tired, always I shoul like to sleep two hours more.

72
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:10,590
-When you wake up you are in a position to have conversation or you like to have

73
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:14,740
half an hour, one hour before you feel in condition to talk?

74
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:25,240
-I don't think so. I'm not very... When my son is getting up at the same time,

75
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:37,730
it's nice to talk to him but I'm not very deep talker in the morning I can say.

76
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:44,150
Can he be Magnesia muriatica?

77
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:48,150
-No.

78
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:57,820
-The more you put a question, then it comes the answer.

79
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,440
Can he be Lycopodium?

80
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:06,110
-Yes.

81
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:13,060
-He can be Lycopodium because he said I want another two hours to keep on sleeping.

82
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:19,860
So he can be Lycopodium.

83
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:41,190
-I hate to wake in a different house with other people. I prefer to take a taxi home.

84
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:50,470
What he said is very important because now you understand what he is in the morning.

85
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:55,710
When he says if I'm a guest in a house and I wake up in the morning and I have to talk

86
00:16:55,810 --> 00:17:08,070
with other people... but he said in the beginning (?)

87
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:17,170
When he wakes up in the morning, he can talk with his son but nobody else.

88
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:22,460
He said I would prefer to take a taxi and go back to my house.

89
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:30,490
Then I take a taxi from the house where I woke up and go in my house.

90
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:16,120
Why did I ask this question?

91
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:41,540
Why I asked for Silica? What I have seen before? He is very cold and what else?

92
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:10,460
I don't ask him for Silica, I ask him for another remedy.

93
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:23,130
-Not at all.

94
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:28,120
-Do your feet perspire enough?

95
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:30,120
-Yes and my feet are cold.

96
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:36,460
-Is it offensive perspiration? Do you have to wash your feet?

97
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:54,120
-No. Now I go from six this morning and they don't smell very much. Do they?

98
00:19:56,060 --> 00:20:05,790
But I like leather shoes, all my shoes are leather shoes.

99
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:07,870
-Otherwise the perspiration is more?

100
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:14,830
-I don't know. When I walk I feel...

101
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:34,210
-When you wake up in the morning do you have to drink a glass of water?

102
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:41,870
-No.

103
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:57,590
But I'm not hungry either. I don't feel hungry.

104
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:06,300
-What is the best time for you?

105
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:13,445
-In the evening and at 8 o'clock I like to have dinner.

106
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,690
-Just once, you have breakfast and then dinner?

107
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:25,630
-When I'm back at home from school at 2.30.

108
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:32,550
And during the night, sometimes I have to eat three times during the night.

109
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:35,890
-You wake up and eat?

110
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:41,480
-Yes, that I have done as long as I can remember.

111
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,520
-You wake up and you go to eat?

112
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:49,230
-Yes.

113
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:45,480
The symptom that he describes is characteristic of Sulphur, Psorinum, China and

114
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:51,150
Lycopodium. Sometimes Phosphorus, as well.

115
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,390
Can anybody tell me what is the remedy I have been thinking?

116
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:01,230
-Nitric acid?

117
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:12,140
-Nitric acid yes, very good. I have been thinking of Nitric acid because of the coldness,

118
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:21,760
the worse wet, because of the great anxiety that seems to prevail all his life,

119
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:35,560
great anxiety about his health and mostly because of the desire of fat which is very strong.

120
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:41,920
Desire for fat is characteristic of Nitric acid and Nitric acid also does not like eggs,

121
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,150
as we said before.

122
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:52,480
He wakes up in the morning and he does not want to talk to others, as we said also.

123
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:13,890
Nitric acid is a remedy that has primarily anxiety about health.

124
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:23,460
But is it Nitric acid?

125
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:33,360
He gives now another symptom how during night he wakes up with hunger.

126
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:49,120
This indicates the possibility of Lycopodium, it has the right from left, it has difficulty to wake up in the morning,

127
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:56,580
it has anxiety about health, sleeps on the right side as he used to sleep

128
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:05,410
but there is one point that we don't like and this is?

129
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:08,660
-Desire for fat and salt.

130
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:23,710
-Desire for fat and salt. Salt is strong for him, desire for sweets is strong for Lycopodium.

131
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:33,800
If he would say that he wants fat but he cannot ignore fat, the combination of fat and salt

132
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:41,130
and aversion to eggs, where Lycopodium would have desire for sweets and very little

133
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:46,650
about salt or fat.

134
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:54,320
I'm trying to confirm now Nitric acid.

135
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:16,250
Actually the Nitric acid idea came when he said he likes eating fat.

136
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:26,880
Immediately by that time eating fat with the anxiety about health,

137
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,870
the main remedy that I think is Nitric acid now.

138
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:50,520
-I'm very heavy smoker. Normally I get two cups of coffee and two cigarettes and then it goes like an explosion.

139
00:26:50,620 --> 00:27:04,140
-But only once, explosive.

140
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,510
-What time in the day?

141
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:16,420
-In the morning, at 7.30 or 8 o'clock.

142
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:21,420
-That's the time you wake up?

143
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:27,260
-I wake up at 7 or I get up at 7.

144
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,880
-And then after an hour?

145
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,510
-Yes.

146
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:43,010
-But now that I stopped smoking...it is regularly.

147
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:45,680
-Is it still explosive?

148
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,790
-Yes.

149
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,610
-You have a lot of gas?

150
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:53,880
-Yes.

151
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,340
-And eructations?

152
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,350
-No.

153
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:07,760
-The gas is very offensive?

154
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:14,090
-Now it is different.

155
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:36,920
Why did I ask about eructations? There is a differential diagnosis between

156
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:44,260
Lycopodium and Nitric acid.

157
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:50,680
He said that he has some flatus but not eructation.

158
00:28:52,640 --> 00:29:03,770
Lycopodium would have been quite a lot of gas, which comes up all the time.

159
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:08,850
And it's ameliorated by bringing up air.

160
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:16,920
-Would you say that you have a kind of anxiety about your health?

161
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:37,180
-Yes I have and I believe I've been hypochondriac.

162
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:42,590
-So you feel hypochondriac, you cannot find anything wrong and then you still feel bad

163
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,540
and you wonder what is going on?

164
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,430
-Yes.

165
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:50,930
-Do you suspect that you have cancer or something serious?

166
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:54,540
-Sometimes I'm thinking of this.

167
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,600
-What it can be? Mostly cancer or heart?

168
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:01,340
-Not heart.

169
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,920
-The idea of cancer comes mostly?

170
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:23,090
-Yes. I've always believed that it was the rheumatism but sometimes when it's aching,

171
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:28,340
then I think it must be something serious.

172
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,680
-Then you are thinking of cancer?

173
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:34,430
-Yes.

174
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:44,340
You see when he says that the pains are arthritic pains or rheumatic pains, he feels it is too much,

175
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,180
it must be cancer.

176
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:57,920
That is a case of either Nitric acid or Agaricus or sometimes Arsenicum or Phosphorus.

177
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:48,090
-Do you have any skin eruption?

178
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:49,130
-No.

179
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:51,840
-Any warts?

180
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:55,600
-I used to have one here.

181
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:05,680
Nitric acid has warts. What kind of warts? What is the peculiarity?

182
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:09,050
-They are bleeding?

183
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,380
-Yes, they are big and bleeding.

184
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:36,600
Look Nitric acid, Causticum and Thuja for bleeding warts.

185
00:32:36,700 --> 00:33:07,590
You are looking skin warts bleeding, page 13-39. But warts of Nitric acid are bleeding.

186
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:15,260
So if I'm thinking of Nitric acid, I would like to see if he has warts that are bleeding.

187
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:21,350
Of course he says he does not have warts now, he used to have.

188
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:38,350
-I used to have one here and I took it away. Now it has started something here.

189
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:42,510
I had that one for a couple of years.

190
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:44,630
-This wart here was big?

191
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:51,430
-Yes.

192
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:57,010
-You went yourself to the doctor and say what is this and he takes it out?

193
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:59,770
-Yes.

194
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:02,590
-Every time it was bleeding this one?

195
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:04,840
-Yes.

196
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:23,760
He says if I touch it, it goes bleeding. This is characteristic of Nitric acid, warts , sometimes,

197
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:30,510
sometimes Thuja I have not seen so much but in Nitric acid it is characteristic.

198
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:55,760
-Are you especially fastidious? You want absolute order?

199
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,630
-Yes.

200
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:17,420
You see now in my mind Nitric acid is the indicated remedy and then again some Lycopodium.

201
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:23,430
Why did I put this question, fastidious?

202
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:32,260
You see the possibility of what remedy?

203
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:41,930
Of Arsenicum, because of the coldness and the desire for fat.

204
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:48,540
Restlessness is not there, I asked him before. Now I only want to confirm that this is not

205
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:57,430
an Arsenicum case, the fastidiousness is tremendous.

206
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:03,380
I will start rethinking the whole case.

207
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:08,710
-It changed.

208
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:29,740
-I think so, I'm not very clever myself.

209
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,410
-Is this Arsenicum?

210
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:42,010
-No.

211
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:58,660
-Is it something peculiar in your symptoms that you didn't tell me and you would like to add?

212
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:11,050
-No. You asked me if I have an argument if I take things(?) but it's a statement,

213
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:21,550
I truly think I can even take a plate but I never touch any, I can't control it.

214
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:25,800
That's when I don't get through verbally,

215
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:33,970
when I'm not able to explain verbally, then I take a plate.

216
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:39,090
-You desire but you never took it.

217
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,800
-Well I do take a plate.

218
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:09,640
-Was any tuberculosis in the family?

219
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:30,020
-No. It must be 10 years ago, then I got prostate.

220
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,420
Why did I ask that?

221
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:48,720
-Because Tuberculinum wants (?)

222
00:38:48,820 --> 00:39:01,050
-And desire for fat is there always with Tuberculinum and desire for what kind of meat?

223
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:15,720
Smoked meat but mostly pork.

224
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:24,330
-Which kind of meat you say you would like mostly?

225
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:36,130
You see immediately I examine that possibility, is there a strong desire for meat

226
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:43,300
and I would like to know is it pork?

227
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,220
-I believe that lamb meat as well.

228
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:06,670
Tuberculinum would say certainly pork

229
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:13,150
but Tuberculinum does not have great anxiety about health.

230
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:17,730
You see the problem now? I will explain to you later.

231
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:59,010
-I do like fish, if I had to say 7 days fish or 7 days meat, I would say fish.

232
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:03,810
There is a problem here.

233
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:10,560
Why there is a problem? Because mostly Phosphorus likes very much the fish and

234
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:21,490
Phosphorus sleeps on the right side, Phosphorus has desire for fat and anxiety...

235
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,280
-What about sausages and fish, what you would prefer?

236
00:41:55,580 --> 00:42:00,560
-I would prefer fish. I don't like sausages.

237
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,550
-Now you don't like but you used to?

238
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:06,880
-I like meat but not sausages, it's mixed. I don't like it when it's mixed.

239
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:09,970
I would like pure meat.

240
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:12,640
-I thought you said you like sausages?

241
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:19,300
-Yes but dry sausage meat.

242
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:31,170
-Between dry sausage meat and fish?

243
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:36,900
-I prefer dry sausage meat.

244
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:57,700
You see the Nitric acid likes salt and meat with fat and likes dry sausage meat.

245
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,730
It is in favor of Nitric acid and not of Phosphorus.

246
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:40,860
-When you say you are thirsty in the evening, what hours do you mean?

247
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,810
-8 o'clock, 7,30.

248
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:47,860
-Onwards?

249
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:52,460
-Yes.

250
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:19,920
-So it is towards the night, 8 onwards, it's not the evening.

251
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:50,150
-Do you think there is any cure? Especially for the sleep?

252
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:56,320
I feel that if I was able to sleep during the night, life would be much better.

253
00:44:56,420 --> 00:45:06,580
Because I'm aching and I'm quite emotional when I'm tired.

254
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:15,480
-I believe that (?)

255
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:34,650
(?)

256
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:57,300
-I'm using that now. Do you think it's wrong to use or can I continue?

257
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:07,710
-When we start this treatment I would like you to discontinue that because then we will know how to proceed.

258
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:11,940
Otherwise we do not know what changes have come because of this or that therapy.

259
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:17,610
For that reason I would like you to discontinue.

260
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:26,350
-Thank you very much. I'm glad I was able to come here, it's a long journey.

261
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:31,360
Thank you very much.

262
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:49,270
One journey between different remedies and how you really go and finally conclude about

263
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:54,690
one remedy or another.

264
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:08,860
You see now why Nitric acid? It has most points from any other remedy.

265
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:15,360
Phosphorus I almost excluded from the beginning, why?

266
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:19,110
Because usually Phosphorus sleeps well.

267
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:23,690
Phosphorus is very seldom when you see, as the main problem, sleeplessness.

268
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:29,940
Phosphorus not only sleeps easily but they sleep well and they are very much refreshed

269
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:33,810
from good sleep.

270
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:43,270
I sleep well and I'm very much refreshed and sleep is my medicine.

271
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:47,270
Here this is not the case, it is exactly the opposite.

272
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:57,770
That's why the Phosphorus possibility is very minute but I examine in the end what he says...

273
00:47:57,870 --> 00:48:02,570
What information he gave that it was Phosphorus?

274
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:10,740
The desire for fish. Desire for fish is a characteristic of Phosphorus element

275
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:16,880
because fish contains a lot of Phosphorus most probably.

276
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:27,630
Phosphorus cases or Natrum Phosphoricum cases and perhaps Calcarea Phosphorica cases

277
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:36,710
and Natrum Muriaticum also desire fish quite a lot.

278
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:45,950
But not Nitric Acid, it's not interested.

279
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:59,280
In this case we went through Sulphur, possibility of Medorrhinum, then Lycopodium,

280
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:04,620
back to Sulphur, back to Lycopodium, Nitric acid, Tuberculinum,

281
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:12,450
Arsenicum and Phosphorus very remote.

282
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:20,960
Therefore I feel some of you are looking at me as if I'm from another planet. That's OK.

283
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:33,870
It's not easy always. Some others I can see they understand the process much more.

284
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:50,540
In this case, after we studied the case, is that first remedy we give is Nitric acid 1M.

285
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:59,700
Then we have the possibility of Lycopodium. There is a strong argument for Lycopodium

286
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:04,150
but not entirely confirmed.

287
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:16,240
Nitric acid is much more confirmed and what is strange in this case is that Norwegian kind of character,

288
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:22,580
where I had to underline the anxiety about health.

289
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,940
If we start from the beginning he tells about anxiety, when I'm asking about anxiety,

290
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:33,820
he says yes, yes, yes I have anxiety.

291
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:43,160
This is a yes of a person who knows what he is talking about, he is quite sincere.

292
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:49,490
I believe that he talks the truth and he did not try to hide any information

293
00:50:49,590 --> 00:51:05,430
but in another person the anxiety would have come out much more intense than what it appeared with him.

294
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:23,620
He said how hypochondriac person... That means for me he has gone and complained and

295
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:35,120
he was not understood and then he thought most probably that the doctors don't understand.

296
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:40,320
I know that  I am seriously sick and they go to see.

297
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:47,020
He said that when I had the pains, I felt that this was too much, going too far

298
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:54,070
and most probably this is cancer, pains in the joints.

299
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:09,530
But mostly if I would base my prescription on anxiety because I asked him

300
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:13,450
and he said yes, that is wrong.

301
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:21,730
The anxiety for me is mostly because of other things he said and the way he said.

302
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:29,780
The way he looked, he wanted to give all information that was possible.

303
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:34,450
He did not try to withhold information.

304
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:48,430
He gave all the information, even that information which was not very nice for his ego.

305
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:59,060
He gave information because he wanted to be seen, to appear that something wrong really is with him.

306
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:05,470
That is a Nitric acid case.

307
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:21,120
-I also saw a possibility for Mercury because he said he has salivation during sleep for a long time

308
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:29,910
and he told me this summer when he went to Spain, he was very tired.

309
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:33,840
He didn't like hot weather so much.

310
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:39,220
-No, he didn't say he didn't like hot weather. He said in hot weather this time

311
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:45,630
I was not better in my pain. That's another thing.

312
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:02,120
-Mercury no.

313
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:11,660
-I believe that the diagnosis maybe right but still we have multiple sclerosis in the beginning,

314
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:19,030
in spite of the fact that he had 10 years ago the first symptoms.

315
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:27,770
The intensity of the disease is quite low, it's not high intensity.

316
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:30,270
And therefore I consider it to be in the beginning.

317
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:35,270
So I don't care if this is a multiple sclerosis or it is something else neuromuscular.

318
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:43,030
Still I believe this case can be helped with Homeopathy because it is the beginning.

319
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:56,700
If if the remedy is not right it is not right, that's another story.

320
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:14,540
Worse from cold, worse from heat also. It is like Magnesia Muriatica.

321
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:23,620
They feel the cold but also they like to go out and have fresh air.

322
00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:39,790
For Lycopodium is strong, they say I don't want to get up from bed. This is strong for

323
00:55:39,890 --> 00:55:42,820
Lycopodium.

324
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:48,280
For Lycopodium is strong the fact that he mentioned always from right to left.

325
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:51,370
This is strong for Lycopodium.

326
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:57,790
Lycopodium is also when he used to sleep in previous years on the right side.

327
00:55:57,890 --> 00:56:06,150
This is strong for Lycopodium. In Lycopodium is also strong the anxiety about health.

328
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:13,120
It is as strong as almost in Nitric acid. Nitric acid is much stronger and Nitric acid

329
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:24,910
makes less noise concerning his anxiety. He tells you the symptoms, he tries to evaluate and

330
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:31,160
then he goes away without telling much about his anxiety but goes to another doctor and

331
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:36,210
tries to confirm what one doctor said against the other.

332
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:43,500
So Nitric acid will not tell you straight forward about their anxieties because they believe

333
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:47,720
that what they know it is better than you.

334
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:55,070
You don't understand, I have cancer. This is the idea behind Nitric Acid.

335
00:56:55,170 --> 00:56:58,400
Always the idea of cancer.

336
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:15,230
With Phosphorus we have symptoms that are against and symptoms that are in favor.

337
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:24,980
The fact that he likes wine, he used to drink wine because he gave that information...

338
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:29,460
What he said? I used to drink wine because of the  moment. Everybody was drinking and I was drinking.

339
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:40,020
But when I came here, I stopped. Now he has stopped drinking or he drinks very little.

340
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:49,110
He has stopped smoking. That again is an anxiety element which is towards Nitric acid.

341
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:56,270
 Phosphorus will not do it. He has anxiety about his health but he likes his smoking,

342
00:57:56,370 --> 00:58:03,860
his drinking, he is excited. He will not give it up so easily.

343
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:16,650
It has to be a person who is concerned about his health. To give up smoking, to give up salt.

344
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:24,220
He is concerned about his health. Phosphorus will not do very much.

345
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:28,800
Phosphorus likes to go to the doctor and say I have my heart or I have cancer and the

346
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:35,220
doctor tells him that he has not and he is happy, he goes away for certain period of time

347
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:47,130
enjoying his cigarettes until next time. It's another personality all together.

348
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:56,130
This personality mostly is the Nitric Acid personality,

349
00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:08,900
though he did not come fully as Nitric Acid anxiety. It can be much stronger in Nitric Acid the anxiety.

350
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:33,070
The fact that he is not better in the sea, he does not want to go to the sea at all...

351
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:46,150
This kind of anxiety you will not see it very much in Medorrhinum.

352
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:56,200
The sleeplessness and the time of aggravation is not Medorrhinum.

353
00:59:56,300 --> 01:00:03,200
Medorrhinum usually suffers during sleep, he suffers during the night.

354
01:00:07,390 --> 01:00:13,790
He has said I feel better in the evening when he goes home and he has a glass of beer

355
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:20,870
or a glass of wine and is at home and he likes home.

356
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:27,490
This is the idea why he says better in the evening.

357
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:32,290
Better in the evening here is not a start symptom that he gave.

358
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:44,730
If it was for Lycopodium, then you may say better in the evening.

359
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:50,980
But it's not a strong symptom that you take it.

360
01:00:52,780 --> 01:01:05,220
He is not a high liver. What we see here is an anxiety about health,

361
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:10,730
it is disturbance in the nervous system, the sleep is disturbed

362
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:17,680
and a person who likes to be at home, he likes to be with his family, not very much an extrovert.

363
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:25,350
He will not go out with friends and other women etc.

364
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:37,930
He does not have points for Medorrhinum, where the Nitric Acid is so strong.

365
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:44,460
You cannot ignore a strong remedy and go to another. It can be anything.

366
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:53,520
Because he has numbness in his gums, it can be Aconitum.

367
01:01:53,620 --> 01:02:03,310
But the remedy that you have to give, the remedy that is covering the case, is Nitric Acid.

368
01:02:03,410 --> 01:02:12,060
Why not Sulphur or Causticum because anxiety, fat etc.?

369
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:26,980
When you try to find the remedy, you try to find what really covers mostly the case.

370
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:48,320
This is strong point for Lycopodium, the appetite in the night.

371
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:50,860
That's why I gave it as a second possibility.

372
01:02:50,960 --> 01:03:01,920
First Nitric Acid, then in case it does nothing, Lycopodium as a second possibility.

373
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:19,190
Then we may be going to Tuberculinum, Medorrhinum, Phosphorus, Mercury...

374
01:03:19,290 --> 02:00:33,520
All these are possibilities but they are weak possibilities. The strongest is Nitric acid.
