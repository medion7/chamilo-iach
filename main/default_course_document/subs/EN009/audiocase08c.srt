1
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,850
We come back to this case now. What potency?

2
00:00:49,850 --> 00:01:00,350
The remedy is clear or not first of all? Yes it's clear.

3
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:13,350
For me it's not clear because this kind of case can hide things behind.

4
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:19,680
To the best of our understanding and ability we've put things together

5
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:33,270
and we said Nat. carbonicum covers best the case.

6
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,930
But it's not a very clear cut case.

7
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,600
I would like you to see the pictures.

8
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:06,070
She said that she would wake up in the night and she would call her son, Marcus!

9
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,990
Then Marcus will not come because he knows that his mother is going to wake up

10
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,410
and kept on sleeping peacefully. He never came to her room

11
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:24,150
but she would still call him and then after a few minutes she will calm down

12
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,750
and go back to sleep.

13
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,920
That was the syndrome.

14
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:19,170
Do you see that the toes are crooked?

15
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,170
Zoom down on the toes.

16
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,840
-During the last two years the hair have grown.

17
00:03:53,100 --> 00:04:03,080
-OK. Tell me something else, how do you feel sexually? You have desire?

18
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,820
-Yes.

19
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:18,500
-Always you had desire?
-Not the time with my husband. Not at all.

20
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:22,650
-When you were with your husband did you have desire for other men?

21
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,310
-No.

22
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:27,060
-Not at all?
-No.

23
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,060
-Are you sure?

24
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:35,800
-Yes, I lived many years without having any contact.

25
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:41,950
-Then what happened with your husband, how did you have a son, if you didn't have a contact?

26
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:55,810
-It was one time when I felt good with my skin after the treatment in the clinic.

27
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:06,820
I had a very good skin and I felt better than the years before and I decided to have a child.

28
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:17,140
At that time I never had a plan to leave my husband and that was...

29
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,640
-It was your decision actually?

30
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:30,000
-It was my decision and it was really the first time it happened.

31
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:37,810
-And the next day you didn't have anymore?
-No.

32
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:43,410
-Just one time and then you didn't want anymore?
-No.

33
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:52,250
-It was the first time in your life and it was a pleasure or it was unpleasure?

34
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:57,740
-I drunk a bottle of wine.

35
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:07,630
-Your son has any skin problem?
-Yes he has acne.

36
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:18,720
-Severe acne?
-Yes, his back, breast and face.

37
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:40,470
-Do you have anxiety about your health?
-Yes since two years.

38
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:50,370
-What are you afraid? You are afraid of heart attack or that you will get cancer,

39
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:54,980
that you will die from a disease?

40
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:10,220
-I often feel so weak and then I think, I can't call a situation.

41
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:32,130
-This on the face, on the nose and on the cheeks always was like that?

42
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:46,230
-It's new, since I took Pulsatilla.

43
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:59,550
Before that I had nothing in the face and I was very happy about that and after Pulsatilla

44
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:06,120
it came in the face and since that time it is in the face.

45
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:17,630
And when I was very young I had it in the face too, in the front only, not here.

46
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:29,140
Why do I ask about this distribution?

47
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:36,130
-For Sepia?
-I don't ask for Sepia.

48
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:52,130
What I'm asking myself in this case is how seriously, how deeply is affected?

49
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:59,790
We have cases of psoriasis in so different degrees, we have severe cases,

50
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:07,540
very severe cases and milder cases and very mild cases. Very mild cases of psoriasis mean nothing.

51
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:14,780
Very severe cases of psoriasis have a lot of problems and psoriasis can go inside

52
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,130
and create a lot of disturbances.

53
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:25,870
Is this a severe case of psoriasis?

54
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,780
It is a very severe case of psoriasis because what we see on the legs,

55
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:42,010
now with the psoriasis being inside has been transformed into duodenal ulcer,

56
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:48,290
into headaches and into psoriatic arthritis.

57
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:58,110
When do we see psoriatic arthritis? In severe cases of psoriasis.

58
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:09,110
When the psoriasis will become from psoriatic arthritis is depending on the time,

59
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:16,350
after a year, after two years, after 20 years. Then the stronger is the case.

60
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,180
The more severe is the case.

61
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,670
If the psoriasis starts and after six months you have psoriatic arthritis,

62
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,670
you have a very serious case at hand.

63
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:31,180
Don't expect, don't tell them I'm going to cure you.

64
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:39,510
Even with the right remedy it's going to take very long time before you bring around such cases.

65
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:43,030
This case is one of those very severe cases, why?

66
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:56,010
Because she had the psoriasis from very young age, under a shock her grandmother died

67
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:04,260
and then it went to another level the psoriasis and then it went into another level.

68
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:11,010
Headaches, pains, exhaustion, psoriasis and arthritic pains.

69
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:15,170
There is a distribution of the disease now and you see it in different levels.

70
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:19,170
Once the disease is going to concentrate in one level the most external,

71
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:26,600
it's going to be quite severe. She is going to go through a severe aggravation of the arthritis.

72
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:32,090
There is no way out. First of all we have to know that and to prepare.

73
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:38,350
To say do you want this? We try. Usually we say what we will do during the crisis.

74
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:43,260
Will you take away my psoriasis? You say, no I don't take it, it's going to stay.

75
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,510
For how long? I don't know.

76
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:48,740
In this case you don't say it will stay one year or two or three years.

77
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:55,750
You don't know really but what is more important from a pathology point of view

78
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,250
in this case that you have to be aware.

79
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:02,670
Can anybody tell me what is going to take place from a pathology point of view,

80
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:04,660
if you give the right remedy?

81
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,940
There is a possibility that something will take place.

82
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,530
What is this something? Can anybody tell me?

83
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:25,370
The whole class knows that; I'm asking something deeper than that.

84
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,870
It will go back to three years ago? No, I don't mean that.

85
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:56,230
-What will take place in her mind?

86
00:12:56,330 --> 00:13:03,830
-Yes and what will take in her physical body? Worse yes. Where?

87
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,170
Duodenal ulcer. No.

88
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:21,300
Mainly the duodenal ulcer is going to be aggravated, though it is the last thing that happened,

89
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:29,310
so it should not be very aggravated. The headaches may be aggravated the first 2-3 days,

90
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:35,410
the duodenal ulcer may be aggravated within the next week or two.

91
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:51,550
The sensitivity to the sun may go away after 3-4 months.

92
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:56,060
There is a sequence of events that will take place and within that sequence

93
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:05,980
we have to expect something which may alarm you. That's why I'm mentioning it.

94
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,480
-A growth.
-Very good.

95
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:19,490
Do you remember that this woman mentioned a fibroma in the uterus?

96
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:35,630
Why a fibroma in the uterus? This woman has a lot of upset in her hormonal system situation.

97
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:43,390
The hormonal upset we see first by suppressing sexual desire almost completely

98
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:47,570
to the extend that she does not have any sexual desire.

99
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:56,990
He was exactly to the month what she meant. They are born the same month.

100
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:02,470
She was in the same age. One year up and down, this is what I meant.

101
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:09,570
It happened but it was exactly How I came to that conclusion? It's not reading the mind.

102
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,800
I will analyze it now.

103
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:39,290
-She had first the husband who was a marriage convenience, he accepted her disease

104
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:44,040
and married him and then she could not have sex with him for different reasons.

105
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:55,280
Then she has a love affair with an older man by whom she likes.

106
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:59,540
Because then she was devastated when he left her.

107
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:08,890
That means she was attached to this man and she was having satisfaction,

108
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:13,740
most probably sexual satisfaction as well, in spite of the fact that he was an older man.

109
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:21,370
But after the shock what happened? The woman goes through that shock,

110
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:29,300
then the hormonal system shrinks again, the desire that was motivated,

111
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:40,300
that was let loose during the second or third, with this doctor,

112
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:51,890
the hormonal system is functioning, trusting and at a certain moment distrust.

113
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:58,030
I made a mistake, I let myself open, I should not have done this.

114
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:10,070
This is how I imagine, the hormonal system draws back desire, you should not have desire.

115
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:23,130
Then in order to do that a woman develops unbalance in her hormonal balance.

116
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:35,640
More female hormones and less male and then through effort male hormones will be more

117
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:44,130
and female hormones will be less because emotionally she thinks it should be this way.

118
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:50,660
I must not have desire, so there is an imbalance in the hormonal system

119
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,510
which reduces the desire for sex.

120
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:59,640
But once she has felt the desire, she cannot reduce it completely.

121
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:07,060
Therefore there is a growth in hair growth pointing out to the possibility

122
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:17,480
of male hormones having increased but at the same time she has the desire,

123
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,330
it is not lost completely.

124
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:23,500
But who can stimulate the desire?

125
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:41,390
Only somebody who is...  she needs a strong sexual partner to reactivate

126
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:49,830
what has been reduced through the shock. So it is a kind of mathematics.

127
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:57,330
All these things are going on in my mind and then I ask is he the same age?

128
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:04,570
This is my thinking. Am I thinking correctly for this case?

129
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:07,030
It is a kind of check-up.

130
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:17,360
Did you remember the point? She says yes, I was surprised he is exactly the same age.

131
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:24,700
I can't believe it. I don't read the mind.

132
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:30,600
You will say why do you need all that? You don't need all that, you can give Natrum carbo

133
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,480
because she has aversion to milk.

134
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:43,180
Some keynote prescribers say aversion to milk? Nat carbo and by chance

135
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:48,180
they don't give one of the other 60 remedies, by chance you give Nat carbo

136
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:52,180
and the case is beautiful.

137
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:58,350
You can do that and you can do a more thorough analysis and a more thorough understanding

138
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:03,030
of what is going on in this case. It depends on what depth.

139
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:06,020
The more you understand the case, the more you learn to understand...

140
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:12,030
This is a process, what I'm teaching you is a process, which in my life time

141
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:17,530
I found it more rewarding.

142
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:24,520
You can be a keynote prescriber, I do not object with that, I will not accuse you

143
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:33,280
but I will say this is a way of prescribing. You want it? It's a bit hard,

144
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:40,100
it needs a lot of application, a lot of study but it's a much more rewarding situation.

145
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:47,210
After three years with keynote prescribing this woman will be exactly the same,

146
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,220
if not worse.

147
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:53,150
With this kind of prescribing after three years, she is going to be better.

148
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:59,810
How much better? I don't know, maybe 30% better, 50% better.

149
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:05,900
After three years 50% better it's nothing. That's all we can do.

150
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,680
We cannot do more, the case is too deep.

151
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:19,390
When she will open up emotionally, with Nat carbo, she will open up emotionally,

152
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:23,880
the hormonal system will vibrate and in the meantime she has a partner

153
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:30,310
and the memory I must not let myself, then the uterus will swell up.

154
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:37,800
The impact will be taken on this level; that's why I predict

155
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:44,820
that we are going to have a big fibroma in the uterus. And then you get scared.

156
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:54,650
Shall we operate? All these conditions come into questioning then.

157
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:01,460
I will give you a rule for operating or not operating which I follow.

158
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:16,710
If the fibroma does not give problems and the person does not have constant bleedings

159
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:23,810
or other discomforts or pains or whatever, leave it alone.

160
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:32,710
Fibromas in one part is like skin, like mucus membranes.

161
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:42,570
They take the impact, they grow but if there is bleeding, you have to take measures.

162
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:49,710
One of the measures of course is to operate, this is not the best thing you can do

163
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:52,570
but you may have to do it.

164
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:08,710
-From the beginning it seemed like her organism was very sensitive to grief.

165
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:13,150
The grandmother died she developed myomas.

166
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,300
From the beginning of the case I was looking for a remedy that had much grief in it,

167
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:35,380
that had myomas after grief. In the beginning she got the psoriasis

168
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:41,880
and then she had headaches after grief, she was devastated when her lover left

169
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:46,290
and I was wondering, I don't have it in my notes, that Nat carbo

170
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:52,150
but it has so much of a grief and I just wanted to enquire about that.

171
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:09,870
-We may say that all the Natrums have ailments from grief with the following sequence.

172
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:18,790
The most is Natrum muriaticum. The next is Natrum carbonicum,

173
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:24,930
the third is Natrum sulphuricum and the fourth is Natrum phosphoricum.

174
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:30,770
In this sequence you will perceive Natrums as having ailments from grief.

175
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:35,810
I would say because of the phosphorus element in the Natrum phosphoricum,

176
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:41,020
you do not get really the deep grief though you get another thing.

177
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:50,530
I have not spoken ever about Natrum phosphoricum but it is a subtle situation

178
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:56,120
which we may have to discuss one day but this is the sequence.

179
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:06,940
Nat carbo is one of the most sensitive Natrums and that's why their solar plexus,

180
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:13,610
the stomach which takes the emotions a lot, which is dealing with emotions is so much affected.

181
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:23,450
Nat carbo is very much affected in the stomach and it is a dyspeptic remedy.

182
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:36,770
It is a remedy that suffers a lot with discomfort, dyspepsia and also Nat carbo

183
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:44,950
is a remedy that alternates between the headaches and stomach pains.

184
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:52,210
There are periods where the stomach pains are much and the headaches less and vice versa.

185
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:55,390
They are periods, six months, nine months etc.

186
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,290
But I would say that in this case we might expect within three years

187
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:08,440
the appearance of the fibroma, it will become much greater than what we see

188
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,180
and we have at this moment.

189
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:18,690
We expect before that, that the psoriasis is going to be quite strongly manifested

190
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:22,930
and also psoriatic pains.

191
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:28,290
I don't believe that we can ever stop the psoriatic pains and the psoriasis.

192
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:36,190
If you expect that the psoriasis will go away, you will make a big mistake.

193
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:41,020
The psoriasis can reach a point that it will be a little less than what we see

194
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:46,680
but she will not have the headaches and she will not have pains and also from time to time

195
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:50,280
she will have arthritic pains.

196
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:58,430
There is no way, I believe maybe I'm wrong but I'm giving you my experience,

197
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:02,790
there is no way that you can cure completely this case.

198
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:32,180
-Not all cases. I would say many fibromas. I would see a connection between

199
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:47,460
hormonal disturbances either conscious or unconscious of a woman and I would see also

200
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:51,530
that this is a good place to appear.

201
00:27:54,540 --> 00:28:03,040
It is still on the periphery, it is not too deep, to appear the manifestation of the disturbance.

202
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,930
-Nux moschata?

203
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:36,020
-No, nux moschata will be in a dizzy state, completely absent minded.

204
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:42,350
This woman is not absent minded, she is a woman who has suffered a lot.

205
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:52,770
You see the story. That kind of suffering of a woman is terrible and still she is on the point

206
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:54,360
when she answers.

207
00:28:56,870 --> 00:29:07,610
We do not see the hesitations, the kind of absent mindness and the kind of inner state of Nux.

208
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:29,270
-What potency?
-Therefore the potency should be...

209
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:43,020
I would suggest is a medium potency, Nat carbo 200 and with serious observation

210
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,870
of what takes place, we wait and wait and wait.

211
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:55,530
Not just wait when there is no reaction, no information.

212
00:29:55,630 --> 00:30:02,110
Wait when there is reaction, there is information but be sensitive to perceive the information.

213
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:12,920
People are saying I'm the same and 80% better and still say I'm the same.

214
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:18,030
If you don't understand that, then you are tending to give another remedy.

215
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:26,930
And it can be 80% better and say still I have my headaches and you press them,

216
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:32,500
you get some Arsenicums and some Natrum muriaticums and some Aurums,

217
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,350
they will not say I'm better.

218
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:42,930
They will just not say it, until everything is cleared up, they don't believe

219
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:44,540
that something will happen.

220
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:51,240
Until everything is cleared up, until this clearing is for a long time and then you lose them,

221
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:56,540
you don't see them again, they don't come and tell you it was very nice,

222
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,140
they don't want to have this kind of exchange of energy.

223
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:15,390
It is too much for a Natrum to owe something, for an Aurum to owe something, for an Arsenicum.

224
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:24,890
It is too much for their psyche to admit that I owe you my life, let's take it to extreme.

225
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:32,730
You get other remedies that are very grateful and they will come and thank you and all that.

226
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:43,540
And we need that, homeopaths absolutely need to hear that because it strengthens them.

227
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:51,220
Because you have one success and five failures, so at least tell me that I have one success.

228
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,300
We need that.

229
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:05,310
-Can you see a remedy that perhaps is following?

230
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:13,310
-That's a good question. I can't really in this case.

231
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:18,460
If you take the symptomatology somebody suggested Borax.

232
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:28,220
It is a possibility but I don't see Borax as a picture. She has quite a lot of symptoms

233
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,400
that is Borax, it is correct.

234
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:43,070
I think what may also need at certain point is a high dose of Ignatia.

235
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:47,590
Nat carbo and then Ignatia at a certain point.

236
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,540
The organism is such a strange complicated thing.

237
00:32:53,640 --> 00:33:03,220
You see the grief and the grief is so deep that instead of Ignatia being the first, it is Nat carbo.

238
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:11,460
And after Nat carbo the grief comes to the surface and she starts crying and  suffering,

239
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:17,580
remembering the past, that is the time for Ignatia.

240
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:23,460
When if Ignatia was given in the beginning it may not have an effect,

241
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:30,120
she may come to an Ignatia state because this is so much grief, she may come into Nat mur state,

242
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:33,710
if she starts eating salt this woman.

243
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:39,450
I would immediately go and give Nat mur. If this woman comes and tells me

244
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:46,700
I have a great desire for salt, I don't need anything else, Nat carbo did a lot,

245
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:52,440
did what it should, now Nat mur. Then after Nat mur we will see the real effect.

246
00:33:52,540 --> 00:34:00,590
The patient will say now I'm better but unless you start in the right sequence of events, forget it.

247
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:19,280
I had my secretary which I had a few years ago. She had tremendous bleedings,

248
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:26,390
I was giving Nat mur, Pulsatilla, Sepia etc. no effect.

249
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:41,280
Then I sit down and take the case Millefolium I give Millefolium and she comes I'm the same,

250
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:44,130
still bleeding, a lot of bleeding.

251
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:56,690
I said wait and then I observe that she had become spiteful. She is very spiteful with me.

252
00:34:56,790 --> 00:35:00,800
Whatever it is, I feel...

253
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:13,530
I said to her do you have a boyfriend? She said yes but lately I have problems.

254
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:18,540
What problems? I don't want to sleep with him.

255
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:25,080
I said before the remedy you were sleeping? Yes there was no problem.

256
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:31,540
Spiteful with aversion to sex after Millefolium Sepia, beautiful

257
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:36,630
But I've given Sepia before, why it did not act?

258
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:42,800
Because it needed Millefolium to bring the picture of Sepia out clearly

259
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:46,630
and then you give it and then you see the effect.

260
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:54,800
Unless these things are understood, we are going to have problems, problems.

261
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:59,280
It is a nice thing when the students come and give me the feedback

262
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:06,870
and say you are right because this is the case I had, this is what happened to me, same things.

263
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:14,970
Then I have an objective feedback from other people who have same experiences.

264
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:21,470
-I'm sorry, I still don't see where you dropped Nat mur?

265
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:40,720
-First of all because Nat mur was not, when I asked about salt, she said no.

266
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:49,810
Then the aversion to milk was too strong. You may say Nat mur has also aversion to milk

267
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:51,280
but it is too strong.

268
00:36:51,380 --> 00:37:01,620
Thirdly the way she described that she wants to be under shade.

269
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:16,120
Natrum muriaticum can tolerate some amount of sun. It does not really to wear a hat all the time,

270
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:22,620
all the time to be under shade. It is Nat carbo that cannot tolerate at all the sun,

271
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,300
it has to be all the time under shade.

272
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:36,130
Not only that but she says I'm more open lately.

273
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:41,360
Nat mur would have been even more closed than what you have seen.

274
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:49,110
She would not have said, if she had been to a Nat mur state, she would have said

275
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:53,620
the last two years I'm more closed. I think I closed more.

276
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:59,680
What she said is that the last years, I'm more open and you remember I said,

277
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:06,520
do you consider yourself an open person? She said yes, considering to how closed I was,

278
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,520
that's what she meant.

279
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:14,020
So before she might have been a Nat mur, we may expect a Nat mur appearing

280
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:17,360
but now we have to give Nat carbo.

281
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:26,280
-She said that she is much more open the last two years and the sensitivity to the sun

282
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:30,380
is also the last two years.

283
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:43,540
-Because if it is a proving, the proving does not last.

284
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:47,770
The symptom of a proving will last 1,2,3 months and it will go away.

285
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:59,880
Also a proving of a remedy, the symptoms of the remedy does not really changes planes.

286
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:11,300
If you have a close remedy, it can make you a suppression but a proving

287
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,470
it won't change levels on health.

288
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:23,320
A proving will be that she was having after Nat mur headaches between 10 to 2 o'clock.

289
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:31,950
That headache will last 1,2 months, 1,2 weeks, 3 months the most.

290
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:34,200
Then they will disappear, they cannot stay.

291
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:41,960
What happened in her it is the shock that changes level and brings out a new state of things.

292
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:45,700
What is this new state? We take into consideration everything

293
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:51,550
and we see that Nat carbo covers the case mostly.

294
00:39:55,550 --> 00:40:00,300
-How do you explain Pulsatilla?

295
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:09,670
-Partial action, it can aggravate a portion, whatever it might be,

296
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:15,210
without starting a real process from inside outwards.

297
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:22,280
Let us say I will give in this case Sulphur, you will see a tremendous aggravation

298
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:29,780
in the skin without an amelioration inside. How this comes? We don't understand it.

299
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:36,280
It is like aggravating a symptom, a level and all the organism remains the same

300
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:41,870
and at a certain point you just aggravate that point. You make disturbances from that point.

301
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:51,030
You will see it in your practice many times, what I'm talking it's not imagination,

302
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:55,190
it's facts that you will see it again and again.

303
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:09,540
The most difficult of these cases was Causticum. Why? Because it was not a strong Causticum.

304
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:12,870
The other Causticum that was strong, you say yes Causticum.

305
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:19,860
This Causticum was not strong. It hesitated and when he came back in the first interview,

306
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:24,050
that's where most of you went wrong.

307
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:34,360
The words that he was using were the same as before but the words do not mean anything.

308
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:43,340
It is facts, how she feels about me. The fact, not what she says.

309
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:52,340
We have to be perceptive for that, we have to be attentive.

310
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:06,230
We will see in the following days, I will show you cases from the beginning with long follow ups

311
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:09,990
and you will see what I mean and you will tell me what is happening.

312
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:19,330
I promised you also to show you a case where I made mistakes. I prescribed wrongly constantly.

313
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:30,840
You like that? You will enjoy this case mostly.

314
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:36,170
You will go away and you will remember only that case.

315
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,570
This is a very interesting case that I want to show you.

316
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:55,840
Some of you have seen some of it, not all the follow up.

317
00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:06,410
You will see a very interesting case that for me it was a teaching case also.

318
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:44,900
-Why it is not Nat carbo in the rubric?
-He asks why Nat carbo...?

319
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:54,050
Because it has not been recorded, it does not mean that it is not there.

320
00:43:54,150 --> 00:44:03,560
But Nat carbo has not as strong ailments from grief as the other Natrum, the Nat mur.

321
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:13,880
This also we know. Also I said it might be Nat carbo first and Nat mur second.

322
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:18,730
The grief may appear more in that woman after Nat carbo.

323
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:26,640
You may have more grief appearing consciously because she is not conscious of all things

324
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:31,730
that are happening. The impact has been taken upon the body.

325
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:42,890
-What about Staphysagria? Is it completely out?

326
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:52,130
-No it is not completely out but we do not have enough information to make a prescription,

327
00:44:52,230 --> 00:45:00,480
where Nat carbo we have a lot. If we repertorize, we will see Nat carbo quiet frequently.

328
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:14,230
-She can continue the light therapy?
-She can continue the light therapy.
