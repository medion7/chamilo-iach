1
00:00:17,293 --> 00:00:23,658
So, it’s about 11 months since you started the treatment.

2
00:00:26,631 --> 00:00:34,487
Can you first tell me what is the situation at the moment and then I will ask you other questions?

3
00:00:36,407 --> 00:00:40,910
– My condition has been improving since I started with the remedy in June.

4
00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:48,391
I’m not so anemic anymore, my whole blood chemistry is better.

5
00:00:49,327 --> 00:00:54,175
My hemoglobin has increased about 80% and that’s good.

6
00:00:55,863 --> 00:01:02,159
My pupillary reflexes are better; I can stand the light better than I did before.

7
00:01:03,815 --> 00:01:13,624
As far as my bladder control is concerned, I don’t have to press so hard my abdomen to get empty my bladder and get the urine out.

8
00:01:14,104 --> 00:01:24,680
This is also positive. As far as my orthostatic blood pressure is concerned, that has also improved.

9
00:01:26,063 --> 00:01:37,343
Of course I still have the dropping of the blood pressure from sitting to standing position but the fall is not so great anymore.

10
00:01:38,567 --> 00:01:50,167
Let’s say, my blood pressure is normal when I am sitting about 100/80 mm Hg which drops down to 80/60 mm Hg.

11
00:01:50,663 --> 00:01:56,823
– Do you still have to be very careful when you get up, or you are getting up freely now?

12
00:01:57,375 --> 00:02:01,775
– I can get up more freely than before. Not entirely.

13
00:02:02,567 --> 00:02:07,079
But I can notice that I don’t have to go so slow.

14
00:02:10,359 --> 00:02:21,040
Of course, I still have some mild relapses of proteinuria but not like before.

15
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:26,598
The relapse regulates itself after about 14 days.

16
00:02:27,663 --> 00:02:48,183
I am testing my urine every day with the stick and in a scale from 1 to 4,
when I get this proteinuria it’s about +1 and then it stays there for about 14 days and then it stops by itself.

17
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:58,102
Before it was just increasing, it didn’t stop until I had to go to the hospital and start with the chemotherapy.

18
00:02:59,496 --> 00:03:04,976
Right now so far, it has been regulated and it takes about 14 days.

19
00:03:05,983 --> 00:03:11,223
– Since you started the treatment, did you go to hospital?

20
00:03:12,696 --> 00:03:23,111
– No, I have been going just for check-ups and control and I’m checking my blood chemistry all the time.

21
00:03:23,951 --> 00:03:40,639
Used to do that once a month to check my kidney function and still my creatinine and my function of the kidneys is good
and the whole blood chemistry has been improving a little bit.

22
00:03:40,983 --> 00:03:45,119
Everything has been increasing. Before my values were really low.

23
00:03:48,135 --> 00:03:53,854
I have noticed that when I get these relapses, these mild relapses,

24
00:03:54,407 --> 00:04:15,303
it always starts with losing stool and it increases the diarrhea and diarrhea stays
there for about 3 days and then I notice on the stick that it gets a very light color,

25
00:04:16,135 --> 00:04:22,743
a little slight proteinuria and then it goes up to +1.

26
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:40,175
Now, I have been having proteinuria for the past 17 days but it has been just +1 on the scale.

27
00:04:40,855 --> 00:04:58,015
3 days ago it increased to +2 and I got your advice and you told me that I should dissolve the remedy in water and I did.

28
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:04,950
I started yesterday taking little sips 4 times a day.

29
00:05:06,031 --> 00:05:14,175
And I checked the urine today and it’s not down to +1 but it’s getting down.

30
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:20,062
It’s still 17 days now.

31
00:05:23,783 --> 00:05:28,583
I don’t have the edemas like I did before.

32
00:05:29,127 --> 00:05:39,295
Still I am not leaking so much and my albumin level is not so low, so I don’t get the edemas and that has been my worst problem.

33
00:05:41,896 --> 00:05:51,984
They are connecting, when I get too many edemas like I had before, with lung edema and of course there is a danger with that.

34
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:02,679
– Another very prominent symptom you had it was the sleepiness.

35
00:06:03,567 --> 00:06:05,159
Great sleepiness. How is that?

36
00:06:05,871 --> 00:06:08,399
– Generally it has been much better.

37
00:06:09,015 --> 00:06:21,199
Of course, when I am leaking I’m tired and I need a lot of sleep and I feel I never get refreshed.

38
00:06:22,687 --> 00:06:30,839
I am still sleepy and feel that I need more sleep.

39
00:06:32,056 --> 00:06:49,199
Even though I can get early to bed… But in that period I am gluten free then I feel ok,
my energy is much better and still with the leaking my energy is better.

40
00:06:55,047 --> 00:07:01,662
– What about the gymnastics? Do you do more gymnastics?

41
00:07:02,248 --> 00:07:05,415
– Yes, I still have problem.

42
00:07:05,991 --> 00:07:12,375
I used to do a little bit of jogging and running, playing tennis but I still have problem with running.

43
00:07:13,023 --> 00:07:18,902
I can walk in a good speed and do the bicycling.

44
00:07:22,135 --> 00:07:24,047
– How the going upstairs?

45
00:07:25,023 --> 00:07:34,015
– It’s a problem. I still have to take it very slowly.

46
00:07:35,071 --> 00:07:43,583
But still there is an improvement I can walk faster upstairs and uphill than I did before.

47
00:07:49,775 --> 00:07:52,023
I am exercising a little bit every day.

48
00:07:52,927 --> 00:08:06,263
I have my own training section in the clinic and there is a program I do and I try to take a walk of at least 30 minutes every day just to get the circulation going,
I think that’s good.

49
00:08:07,295 --> 00:08:17,679
As far as food is concerned I’m trying to eat a little bit of everything but I’m trying to avoid red meat.

50
00:08:19,295 --> 00:08:21,000
– But you take some time red meat?

51
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:28,512
– I can take it once in a while but it’s a little strange sometimes I react upon the red meat.

52
00:08:29,504 --> 00:08:37,992
It seems there are certain food I can tolerate, all the time I get loose stools and diarrhea.

53
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:42,768
There are certain food I know I am reacting upon.

54
00:08:43,447 --> 00:08:50,063
I have to be careful with sweets, white flour, sugar and certain milk products.

55
00:08:50,999 --> 00:08:56,655
I can tolerate cream but I have to be careful with milk.

56
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,431
Then I get loose stools and diarrhea.

57
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:09,942
– In all this period of the 11 months, did you ever have any stool with blood?

58
00:09:10,671 --> 00:09:27,663
– No, I try to check that. The color of my stool has been ok, but I know that I have a little hemorrhoid.

59
00:09:30,915 --> 00:09:32,219
So, I look at it and it’s not dark.

60
00:09:34,515 --> 00:09:42,646
– Tell me something else. When you initially had this colitis, did you have pains?

61
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:47,374
– No. I didn’t have any pain.

62
00:09:47,846 --> 00:09:49,582
– You never had any pain. – No.

63
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:55,421
– Neither now? – No. I don’t have any pain.

64
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:10,982
– Is the diarrhea always a forerunner of leaking or is it of late that you noticed that more clearly?

65
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,886
Of the last 5-6 months.

66
00:10:14,606 --> 00:10:16,654
– It’s always a forerunner for the leak.

67
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,982
It usually takes about 3 days.

68
00:10:24,734 --> 00:10:32,974
If I could find something which could stop this and keep my stomach ok it would be fine.

69
00:10:33,702 --> 00:10:36,670
– That’s what we’ll try to do today.

70
00:10:37,231 --> 00:10:45,117
In the meantime I want you to tell us how you take the remedy from the beginning.

71
00:10:45,566 --> 00:10:48,230
So the class can hear it.

72
00:10:48,894 --> 00:10:58,887
– I started with potency 30C for a couple of days and then we tried 200C for 1 day.

73
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:10,934
I didn’t see any change after that, then we went down to 12C…

74
00:11:12,886 --> 00:11:20,022
- But when you started… Because I remember you sent a fax saying there is no effect in the beginning.

75
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:26,910
Did you have to take chemotherapy immediately after starting or you went back?

76
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:31,510
– I had to, because it took some time before I got the remedy.

77
00:11:31,974 --> 00:11:46,753
I had to wait and I got in touch with you because it was gradually increasing my proteinuria and
my edema got massive and then I had to go to the hospital and got one injection to stop it.

78
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,896
– That was last June.

79
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,712
– Yes. When I got home. Then I got the remedy.

80
00:11:54,872 --> 00:11:57,424
– You took 30C for 3 days?

81
00:11:58,223 --> 00:12:02,119
– Yes, I think it was 3 days.

82
00:12:02,983 --> 00:12:09,863
Then it still kept going up and then we tried 200C once.

83
00:12:10,968 --> 00:12:12,824
But it still did not stop it.

84
00:12:13,672 --> 00:12:27,200
Then we agreed I had to do something drastic to stop it and I went to
the hospital and then I got that Sendoxan IV and it took care of it.

85
00:12:27,728 --> 00:12:31,776
Then I started with 12C.

86
00:12:33,144 --> 00:12:37,511
– You started 2 or 3 times a day?

87
00:12:38,263 --> 00:12:40,991
– I started once a day 12C.

88
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,288
We kept on doing that.

89
00:12:48,584 --> 00:12:58,024
Of course then I was protein free and we kept on going with this potency for 1 month.

90
00:12:58,928 --> 00:13:08,928
And then we went up to 13C and I stayed on 13C for some time, probably 1 month.

91
00:13:09,951 --> 00:13:16,551
Then we agreed on increasing the potency by 1C every month.

92
00:13:17,432 --> 00:13:33,000
In that period when I got these mild relapses, I tried to increase the
dose and take 1 in the morning and 1 in the evening, twice a day.

93
00:13:38,928 --> 00:13:44,050
It took about 14 days before I could see a change.

94
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:55,778
– But so far, from July until today, on the scale from 1 to 4, it never went up more than 1.

95
00:13:56,433 --> 00:13:57,425
– Yes.

96
00:13:59,178 --> 00:14:10,779
– Except of this time which went a little bit over and I told you to take it 4 times yesterday and you can already see …

97
00:14:11,194 --> 00:14:13,097
- I can see a little change.

98
00:14:13,729 --> 00:14:17,985
It’s not down to 1 yet but I can see the change, it has the tendency to go down.

99
00:14:20,978 --> 00:14:26,034
I’m excited for tomorrow to see… I am testing every day.

100
00:14:28,186 --> 00:14:40,834
That’s important for me to always check my albumin level because if it gets under 20, I get the edemas.

101
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,450
So I try to avoid that.

102
00:14:45,066 --> 00:14:49,897
But so far I don’t have any edema.

103
00:14:50,761 --> 00:15:03,490
The only thing when I am leaking a little bit now, when I wake up in the
morning I can see I have a little edema under my eyes and also my eyelids.

104
00:15:04,258 --> 00:15:09,329
It’s hard to notice for someone who doesn’t know me but I can see it.

105
00:15:12,154 --> 00:15:15,682
Except of that I don’t have any other symptoms.

106
00:15:17,282 --> 00:15:26,649
I get more tired in that period but except of that there is nothing else.

107
00:15:28,273 --> 00:15:33,017
And of course my energy level is a little lower.

108
00:15:34,074 --> 00:15:47,178
– I want to ask something else. During all this period did you ever get any inflammation of the lungs?

109
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:59,962
– No, I haven’t had it and usually when I get a cold it goes down to my bronchi.

110
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:05,801
This time I hadn’t have any of this bronchitis.

111
00:16:06,698 --> 00:16:10,066
– But did you get any cold on your nose?

112
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:29,874
– It just got started a little bit, but I have been taking some vitamin C and in the next day it was all gone.

113
00:16:31,058 --> 00:16:37,362
So then I got a high dose of vitamin C, about 1000mg.

114
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:42,130
Except of that I haven’t been taking anything else.

115
00:16:43,946 --> 00:16:50,681
– Can you tell me if there are any symptoms which have appeared?

116
00:16:52,233 --> 00:16:56,929
Do you perspire now more or how is your sensitivity to cold?

117
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:09,817
– I’m not freezing that much, I think that it is a little better.

118
00:17:15,818 --> 00:17:20,498
I still have the problem with the saliva.

119
00:17:25,081 --> 00:17:29,929
My mouth is always dry and I have to drink a lot of water.

120
00:17:30,706 --> 00:17:33,578
That’s the only thing I am drinking.

121
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,730
– Do you drink some alcohol?

122
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:52,242
– Once in a while a little bit wine with the food and a beer once in a while but I’d rather take water.

123
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:54,778
I enjoy water too.

124
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:58,466
– Can you give me an idea of what you are eating?

125
00:18:01,153 --> 00:18:10,970
– In the morning I eat some eggs, I eat a good breakfast.

126
00:18:12,586 --> 00:18:20,833
I take some oatmeal, a couple of pieces of bread and about 3-4 eggs.

127
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:28,642
I like to eat a little protein in the morning because if I don’t I get hungry very fast.

128
00:18:29,698 --> 00:18:35,601
And I feel to get my thyroxin production, my metabolism going by eating some protein in the morning.

129
00:18:38,794 --> 00:18:40,849
In the middle of the day I eat some fruits.

130
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:50,754
– Lunchtime?

131
00:18:51,322 --> 00:19:10,114
– I could take cottage cheese with some fruits, half chicken or I can get some pieces of bread with cheese.

132
00:19:14,025 --> 00:19:31,897
In dinner I eat some fish or some white meat, it could be of any kind but the best meat I can eat is turkey.

133
00:19:32,449 --> 00:19:37,041
Because I read it contains enzymes which are very good for my digestion.

134
00:19:38,538 --> 00:19:43,058
And there is very little fat, nearly no fat at all.

135
00:19:47,793 --> 00:20:03,849
Before I go to bed if I am hungry I can eat some scrambled eggs, salmon, shrimps, and some light food.

136
00:20:04,289 --> 00:20:05,961
– Vegetables?

137
00:20:06,449 --> 00:20:11,665
– I also eat vegetables and salad usually in my dinner.

138
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:18,490
I enjoy tomatoes.

139
00:20:19,274 --> 00:20:24,802
– What brings diarrhea to you except of milk? What other food?

140
00:20:31,658 --> 00:20:45,362
– The worst thing I can eat is chocolate and white flour, like in sweet cakes. I can’t tolerate that.

141
00:20:46,626 --> 00:20:48,546
– What will it happen?

142
00:20:49,746 --> 00:21:05,674
– I start with some gas in the stomach and then pretty fast, I start to get loose stool and diarrhea.

143
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:12,841
And then I have to get it out to feel better.

144
00:21:14,905 --> 00:21:18,697
– So, white flour… bread?

145
00:21:19,274 --> 00:21:23,026
– White bread is not so good for me neither.

146
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:31,722
I eat a darker type of bread, rye bread.

147
00:21:34,554 --> 00:21:42,330
I noticed that all food that contains white flour is no good for me.

148
00:21:43,066 --> 00:21:48,489
Oatmeal is good. I eat that in the morning.

149
00:21:51,689 --> 00:21:53,641
– What about butter? You take butter?

150
00:21:54,402 --> 00:22:02,922
– Yes. No problem. I eat bread with butter because I think it’s very good to get vitamin A.

151
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:07,929
I try to avoid the other sources, the artificial ones.

152
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:24,729
– What about meat that has meat that fat in it? If you eat the skin of the turkey?
Does it affect your stool if you take a little bit fat with meat?

153
00:22:26,073 --> 00:22:37,415
– I know if I eat pork, it will affect me. Then I get loose stool.

154
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:50,399
 Sometimes I can tolerate certain food one day…

155
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:57,351
- But you haven’t connected it with something else?

156
00:22:58,239 --> 00:23:05,390
– I have been trying to do that but.

157
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:12,967
But if I eat some food in connection with other food, that could affect me.

158
00:23:13,991 --> 00:23:37,102
So, I have been trying to test and find out if I am allergic to certain food and I have one physician in Oslo,
who is running some allergic tests to find the reactions to certain food and sends the results to the States.

159
00:23:40,818 --> 00:23:45,954
I didn’t react too much. The only thing she mentioned was broccoli.

160
00:23:50,537 --> 00:23:52,241
– Do you like the broccoli yourself?

161
00:23:52,770 --> 00:24:03,066
– Not especially. I can eat it but it’s not like I enjoy it so much.

162
00:24:03,898 --> 00:24:06,289
– How much sweets you would like?

163
00:24:09,905 --> 00:24:16,449
– I don’t really have hunger for sweets, I would take a fruit.

164
00:24:17,466 --> 00:24:20,578
– What about the salt? Are you careful with it?

165
00:24:22,081 --> 00:24:33,642
– Yes, I don’t use very much salt. I add some in my oatmeal but nothing special. I like bananas.

166
00:24:40,977 --> 00:24:42,865
– Can you eat 10-20 bananas?

167
00:24:44,434 --> 00:24:49,841
– During the day I can eat 4-5 bananas in between when I feel a little hungry.

168
00:24:50,474 --> 00:24:52,178
– Every day you take bananas?

169
00:24:52,778 --> 00:24:57,354
– Yes. But my idea is that I should take at least one banana every day to get my potassium.

170
00:24:58,729 --> 00:25:01,065
Except of that I think that banana is ok.

171
00:25:01,673 --> 00:25:03,209
– But do you like bananas?

172
00:25:03,738 --> 00:25:07,986
– I like them yes. I also like all fruits.

173
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:15,977
Banana is one fruit I can eat without getting too much gas in the stomach.

174
00:25:16,569 --> 00:25:24,649
If I eat an apple or a pear or something like that I can
get a little gas, but banana is pretty safe so I do that.

175
00:25:26,218 --> 00:25:39,210
If I take cottage cheese it’s a actually a milk product I don’t react
upon that because I take a little banana in it and that might help me.

176
00:25:39,794 --> 00:25:43,858
– Do you know if you grind your teeth during sleep?

177
00:25:47,306 --> 00:25:54,370
– No, my wife never told me about that. I sleep generally very well.

178
00:25:57,994 --> 00:26:00,362
When I get to bed I can sleep in 10 minutes.

179
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:09,201
– In your family was any member from your mother or father side suffering of tuberculosis?

180
00:26:10,329 --> 00:26:11,681
– No.

181
00:26:15,202 --> 00:26:16,898
– Do you have brother or sister?

182
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:18,946
– I have 2 brothers.

183
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:23,570
– Anybody having kidney problems?

184
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:29,081
– No. I am the only one.

185
00:26:31,561 --> 00:26:35,289
– And when you went to the USA you were totally healthy.

186
00:26:35,747 --> 00:26:42,825
– Yes. But I was a bit worn out.

187
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:49,753
I have been working very hard with a lot of patients, a lot of stress and my immune system was very low.

188
00:26:51,506 --> 00:27:06,778
That’s why I thought that I got something in the food when I was there, we were in that orchestra and we ate at the coffee shops
but they couldn’t find anything out of there.

189
00:27:14,418 --> 00:27:31,290
I took the biopsy of my left kidney but there was very slight inflammation, nearly not noticeable.

190
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:39,881
– When you drink water is it because you feel thirsty, because you have to drink or because your mouth is dry?

191
00:27:40,313 --> 00:27:51,210
– My mouth is extremely dry. Like now, if I have been talking 5-10 minutes it gets dry like sandpaper.

192
00:28:16,618 --> 00:28:23,826
I have to drink all the time in the clinic too if I am talking, I depend on having water all the time.

193
00:28:25,794 --> 00:28:36,106
– Are you organized in your things, your room?

194
00:28:40,658 --> 00:28:46,353
– I am pretty organized. I like to have order.

195
00:28:47,273 --> 00:28:57,274
– But you like it very much? Does everything have to be in its place and you are aggravated if it is not?

196
00:28:57,866 --> 00:29:11,834
– Not particularly, but I like to have some order both in the clinic and at home.

197
00:29:16,978 --> 00:29:25,106
 I don’t need to have everything in line, I like to have an order.

198
00:29:29,506 --> 00:29:36,553
– Did you notice any change in your mood? Are you less or more irritable?

199
00:29:40,834 --> 00:29:44,506
Or is your psychological mood the same?

200
00:29:48,994 --> 00:29:54,953
– I think it’s about the same as before.

201
00:29:58,802 --> 00:30:05,802
I am enjoying life but when I am leaking I am thinking all the time…

202
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:12,905
Anxiety and I am thinking of what I can do.

203
00:30:14,329 --> 00:30:19,817
I am trying to think about what is aggravating it and causing it.

204
00:30:23,778 --> 00:30:29,025
Now I am very concerned about why I get these loose stools and diarrhea.

205
00:30:30,001 --> 00:30:34,417
What did I eat… And I have to find out that.

206
00:30:35,546 --> 00:30:37,954
– When you are in high places and look down…

207
00:30:38,434 --> 00:30:40,250
- I don’t like that.

208
00:30:49,418 --> 00:30:59,506
– If somebody else is near the balcony and it is very high you don’t like it either and you say come in or this does not affect you?

209
00:31:00,849 --> 00:31:08,609
– That doesn’t affect me that much but myself I have to stay a little bit behind, I don’t like that.

210
00:31:10,426 --> 00:31:14,898
I am feeling that somebody is pulling me across.

211
00:31:18,554 --> 00:31:23,825
That’s the only thing I have a little fear about; heights.

212
00:31:24,914 --> 00:31:27,610
– Do you perspire at all during sleep?

213
00:31:28,746 --> 00:31:32,034
– That’s another thing; I don’t perspire at all.

214
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:36,505
I have very little perspiration.

215
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:47,906
What I should tell you is when I get these loose stools and diarrhea it has a bad smell.

216
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:50,706
It’s a very sharp odor.

217
00:31:51,562 --> 00:31:53,641
– Does it remind you something?

218
00:31:54,737 --> 00:32:07,786
– Yes. It’s a bad odor and if you were in the room you would probably say that it’s a Sulphur case.

219
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:22,522
But it is very sharp smell and it stays in the room for a long time.

220
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,545
Today my stool was ok.

221
00:32:34,681 --> 00:32:40,825
The last couple of days has been loose, it changed a little bit and from today it is ok.

222
00:32:45,482 --> 00:32:47,585
New color and no smell.

223
00:32:50,193 --> 00:32:55,505
– You are ready now to go to the next potency which will be 16C?

224
00:32:55,794 --> 00:32:59,538
– Yes, I am on 15C now. I finished it.

225
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:02,474
– Now you go to 16C.

226
00:33:07,505 --> 00:33:15,585
– Yes. I think I will get it from Belgium, it’s going to be ready for me.

227
00:33:16,906 --> 00:33:20,746
– You are going to take it 3 times a day.

228
00:33:21,978 --> 00:33:26,601
– You want to me dissolve it in water or take it directly?

229
00:33:27,113 --> 00:33:28,769
– Take it directly.

230
00:33:31,146 --> 00:33:32,258
– I do that.

231
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:38,241
– Your nails… Are they brittle, they break easily?

232
00:33:39,122 --> 00:33:59,081
– No it’s strong and my hair grows fast and my nails grow. I have to cut them too frequently.

233
00:34:02,938 --> 00:34:08,786
– Ok, we go inside and we talk about the analysis of your case and then we continue.

234
00:34:10,418 --> 00:34:16,377
Now with his case we still have to do a lot of work.

235
00:34:19,545 --> 00:34:29,882
As you already heard I continued with the same medication because the whole picture has not really changed.

236
00:34:30,474 --> 00:34:35,097
If you see the symptomatology is less but still is there.

237
00:34:37,721 --> 00:34:41,129
The anemia is only 80% better; we still have to go.

238
00:34:41,762 --> 00:34:47,114
The blood pressure is still 100 still has to go up.

239
00:34:48,298 --> 00:34:58,522
The kidney is still leaking. There are no essential changes to indicate the next remedy.

240
00:34:59,938 --> 00:35:18,050
There are some symptoms which belong to an underlying remedy, for instance the
symptom which he has, vertigo high places, belongs to the underlying remedy.

241
00:35:20,194 --> 00:35:29,537
These are very good indications but Acetalinidum will never take care of this fear.

242
00:35:30,746 --> 00:35:46,290
This fear will be taken care of, most probably when Calcarea carbonica or Sulphur, either of the 2 remedies,
will pop up in the next stage.

243
00:35:47,201 --> 00:36:16,433
And then in the next stage his colitis will be a little bit stronger than it is today and it may also reappear
with some blood, in which case if we have given the remedy and we have that reaction you’ll say very well.

244
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:23,809
You brought it back to the original state from which the whole thing started, from ulcerative colitis.

245
00:36:25,066 --> 00:36:30,282
And then this will go away in a little while and then you will have a steady cure.

246
00:36:30,978 --> 00:36:35,569
The kidneys have gone back to the normal condition.

247
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:54,537
Another thing we have been talking about and I want to stress again
is this idea; this upper layer Acetanilidum and he gets Acetanilidum…

248
00:36:57,609 --> 00:37:15,306
And the underlying layer is Calcarea carbonica.

249
00:37:16,419 --> 00:37:20,634
 This is vertigo high places which appears here also.

250
00:37:23,666 --> 00:37:38,714
If this organism gets a big stress will come back to Acetanilidum that’s why Acetanilidum is indicated.

251
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:44,442
That means that every day he has a relapse and the relapse is Acetanilidum.

252
00:37:47,218 --> 00:38:00,450
Once Acetanilidum has finished its action then it will not
act anymore and you give Calcarea carbonica and it acts.

253
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:11,202
Then the relapse in case he gets a stress here again will be Calcarea carbonica not Acetanilidum.

254
00:38:25,577 --> 00:38:26,673
Perhaps you are not aware.

255
00:38:27,249 --> 00:38:30,713
This information is given for first time.

256
00:38:31,241 --> 00:38:33,513
For the first time I give this information from A to Z.

257
00:38:34,273 --> 00:38:36,073
This means all the knowledge I have.

258
00:38:36,577 --> 00:38:39,057
It’s a historic class!

259
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:56,088
I give portions of information in this and that seminar but here systematically I try to give
all the information that you are needing as a practitioner to practice Homeopathy properly.

260
00:38:56,679 --> 00:39:04,327
– Nobody who doesn’t know this remedy could have solved this case because I didn’t find it once in the repertory.

261
00:39:05,511 --> 00:39:10,447
– That is true and that is what I said about the strategy.

262
00:39:11,671 --> 00:39:21,552
I said where you will find the remedy that has the essential features of the case.

263
00:39:25,232 --> 00:39:29,103
This remedy had the essential features of his case.

264
00:39:29,911 --> 00:39:39,040
Of course you have to know and that is why I wanted to make a repertory which can give information about that case also.

265
00:39:41,496 --> 00:39:45,983
I would like to make a new repertory but never mind… this is another story.

266
00:39:51,583 --> 00:40:00,695
– What I did not quite understand; you said when the relapse will be Calcarea carbonica is it because it is very basic remedy?

267
00:40:02,671 --> 00:40:04,863
Why are you so sure it cannot be something else?

268
00:40:05,455 --> 00:40:08,191
– Underneath it can be anything. We don’t know yet.

269
00:40:08,759 --> 00:40:11,895
It can be Arsenicum, Calcarea carbonica, Sulphur.

270
00:40:12,904 --> 00:40:29,968
I said let us suppose the next remedy is Calcarea carbonica and you give it and
it acts then after this after this organism gets a shock then he has a relapse.

271
00:40:30,784 --> 00:40:32,872
But what will the relapse be?

272
00:40:33,936 --> 00:40:36,880
Not anymore Acetanilidum but Calcarea carbonica.

273
00:40:39,990 --> 00:41:05,061
– My question is when I was observing the patient during the interview the impression that this person has really anxiety about his health
and at the same time as a neighbor I could tell definitely this gentleman is very fastidious and he takes care of how is looking and so on.

274
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:10,174
For me it would be a big temptation to fall down to Arsenicum.

275
00:41:11,598 --> 00:41:31,070
But then when I started to think that probably that is something like in your book the Essence of Homeopathy I have
read that some intellectual patients can bring information about broccoli, contents of proteins of different products,

276
00:41:31,494 --> 00:41:35,382
medical tests, is it this kind of case?

277
00:41:36,085 --> 00:41:40,189
– Yes. Let me comment on what you are saying.

278
00:41:41,437 --> 00:41:45,916
What you can rely on… The information he gave about eating.

279
00:41:46,532 --> 00:41:48,604
On what information you can rely on.

280
00:41:49,516 --> 00:41:51,508
There was one symptom on which you can rely.

281
00:41:52,036 --> 00:42:03,012
What was this symptom? Banana, eggs, no!

282
00:42:03,972 --> 00:42:13,069
There is only one symptom you can rely on and this is diarrhea from milk. That is for sure.

283
00:42:14,085 --> 00:42:21,724
The rest is the eggs he takes to replace the protein etc. And he has his reasons.

284
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:34,477
The bananas for the potassium etc. He has his reasons because he has studied this kind of medicine, then he is careful and he says forget it.

285
00:42:35,645 --> 00:42:38,684
Then we go to the question about the anxiety about health.

286
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:50,845
Yes, but if you had the same problem tell me if you would have anxiety or not, whether you would be careful or not.

287
00:42:51,757 --> 00:42:55,060
Of course if you are Sulphur you may not even take care.

288
00:42:55,916 --> 00:43:03,220
You would say forget it give me some wine… Let’s live today, die tomorrow.

289
00:43:05,077 --> 00:43:14,132
– I noticed he is battling a lot with tiredness and fatigue and weakness.
Where do I find weakness and fatigue in the layers you have showed us?

290
00:43:19,364 --> 00:43:22,764
– You mean in the hierarchy?

291
00:43:23,228 --> 00:43:24,492
– Yes.

292
00:43:27,781 --> 00:43:34,204
– The tiredness is connected with the kidneys, so you will be looking at the kidneys level.

293
00:43:35,372 --> 00:43:40,268
Another tiredness will be connected with liver; you will be looking at the liver level.

294
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:56,068
Another tiredness will be connected with lungs. Asthmatic tiredness; you will be looking at the lungs.
And the fatigue, the tiredness, the sleepiness?

295
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:03,532
– She said when can I find in the hierarchy scale weakness.

296
00:44:04,213 --> 00:44:09,292
I said you don’t find it, you find it in the heart; weakness because of a heart problem.

297
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:17,996
Weakness because of kidney problem; you find it in kidneys. Alright?

298
00:44:19,181 --> 00:44:22,132
– Yes, but also I am talking about the sleepiness.

299
00:44:22,644 --> 00:44:25,060
He is so tired. He falls asleep here.

300
00:44:25,612 --> 00:44:27,348
Where can I find that?

301
00:44:28,116 --> 00:44:44,692
– Sleepiness is not just by itself, it is a secondary effect of some problems within the organism, which is on the physical level.

302
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:56,723
Where the seat of anatomical problem is, there is the sleepiness.

303
00:44:58,388 --> 00:45:06,652
For instance you give a remedy and after the remedy the patient says I am sleeping and I can’t wake up.

304
00:45:07,308 --> 00:45:09,228
I sleep 12-14 hours a day.

305
00:45:09,845 --> 00:45:13,172
And we say this is a very good reaction.

306
00:45:13,996 --> 00:45:22,797
So the sleepiness by itself is not put in the hierarchy, it is to what it is connected pathologically.

307
00:45:23,588 --> 00:45:37,020
What is the pathology which brings about the sleepiness?
Sleepiness can come because of lack of oxygenation of the brain…

308
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:47,116
The old people are arteriosclerosed sleep all the time, because of it. It is different.

309
00:45:48,269 --> 00:46:00,197
Sleepiness can come from conflict. People get grief and they go to sleep for 12 – 15 hours to get over the grief.

310
00:46:01,285 --> 00:46:04,446
So sleepiness is not by itself.

311
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:21,014
– Concerning the mental emotional level we haven’t heard very much about this and you may say in
Homeopathy, if there are no symptoms of mental emotional level, no remedy is needed for that.

312
00:46:21,414 --> 00:46:28,677
But still, some questions about dreams, about times of sadness, about mood, I haven’t heard anything.

313
00:46:29,493 --> 00:46:33,190
Maybe I haven’t seen the whole interview before but what about this?

314
00:46:35,645 --> 00:46:43,904
– In this particular case. You can see, I ask do you have fears.

315
00:46:44,321 --> 00:46:46,689
You want to "make" fear, "make" anxiety about health.

316
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:50,328
You ask the patient and he says yes, I have a fear.

317
00:46:51,184 --> 00:46:58,752
I fear high places. That’s it. You have fears? He thinks and says no, I don’t.

318
00:46:59,625 --> 00:47:01,361
– But he have said it.

319
00:47:01,865 --> 00:47:09,440
– He said yes, I have one fear. I look from a high place down and this is my only fear.

320
00:47:13,608 --> 00:47:27,176
And sadness and dreams… Ok. You can ask about dreams if you want but the idea is not to go away from the essentials.

321
00:47:27,824 --> 00:47:38,121
Here is the periphery. You see little symptoms. You lose this and you say here is a circle.

322
00:47:38,873 --> 00:48:02,688
No. The essentials! They gave him several remedies, they gave him Nat-m., Ign., Ars. …
He has taken all these remedies, no effect.

323
00:48:03,296 --> 00:48:06,272
There is not going to be any effect from these remedies.

324
00:48:15,329 --> 00:48:23,585
– I want to say something about his diet. He said that his body doesn’t tolerate milk.

325
00:48:25,201 --> 00:48:36,937
I think there is some sensitivity towards milk, this might affect his kidneys as well.

326
00:48:37,464 --> 00:48:52,009
And then he said he is very thirsty, so to me it is quite natural because he eats so much protein all day and this is natural,
that you get very thirsty. And then about his sleepiness.

327
00:48:52,936 --> 00:49:00,360
When you eat so many proteins, this makes him tired as well because the body has to work so much.

328
00:49:01,825 --> 00:49:07,345
– If we had a dietician here he would contradict everything you said and he would tear you into pieces.

329
00:49:10,688 --> 00:49:15,408
Protein diets give so much energy.

330
00:49:16,216 --> 00:49:21,872
Not only does not give tiredness, they give a lot of calories, a lot of energy.

331
00:49:23,409 --> 00:49:28,168
People go to such diets to have energy.

332
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:37,704
You can say whatever you like, the problem is that he has kidneys which aren’t working.

333
00:49:38,561 --> 00:49:41,225
Of course he is going to feel very tired.

334
00:49:41,849 --> 00:49:55,617
Of course he needs to relax to get back some energy and never mind how much protein he takes, it’s
not because of the protein that he has weakness, it’s because of the kidneys that are not working.

335
00:50:00,233 --> 00:50:02,057
She disagrees.

336
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:06,528
– I have one more question concerning the future treatment of the patient.

337
00:50:07,232 --> 00:50:17,601
Is it so that he will keep taking Acetanilidum until he has his old
colitis again and then receives another remedy or how will you proceed?

338
00:50:18,945 --> 00:50:34,432
– Well, this is very difficult to predict but I say what most probably will happen is this, but
I am not sure if it will happen with Acetanilidum, but it may happen with the next remedy.

339
00:50:35,233 --> 00:50:52,081
The next remedy may be Sulph., may be Calc., may be Ars.There are points for Sulph.
and Calc. at this moment and I suspect that rather Calc. is the underlying remedy.

340
00:50:53,201 --> 00:51:00,280
Until he gives me signs of Calc. … What are the signs of Calc.?

341
00:51:01,528 --> 00:51:11,177
The cold feet, the sweatiness, the perspiration in the night etc.
All these will take me to Calc. and then I prescribe.

342
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:25,697
Then I said most probably, I am not a prophet, after the Calc. he will go to the original
state from which the whole thing started.

343
00:51:26,233 --> 00:51:28,753
And that was ulcerative colitis.

344
00:51:29,289 --> 00:51:43,673
The ulcerative colitis will take place for 1 -2 weeks and then the
organism will stabilize itself and the kidneys will be out of danger.

345
00:51:44,945 --> 00:51:55,770
We still have to understand that we have to do a lot of work with his case before he is really cured.

346
00:51:58,465 --> 00:52:11,265
It’s not like you just give Acetanilidum and he will be well. No.
I perceive that under Acetanilidum he will need Calc.

347
00:52:13,521 --> 00:52:19,793
– And why did you ask for the bronchitis? Is this something you would expect to reappear now?

348
00:52:20,201 --> 00:52:25,744
– The bronchitis came during the state of depression. His organism was depressed.

349
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:37,169
So the bronchitis actually is a side effect of the kidney and the digestion problems.

350
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:48,713
We have a series like this; digestive problem, colon affected, kidneys affected, lungs affected.

351
00:52:51,313 --> 00:53:16,625
So, lungs have to be strengthened first as the result of a general weakness of the organism because of the kidneys.

352
00:53:17,632 --> 00:53:28,201
The kidneys get better so the organism reacts better to bronchitis for instance.

353
00:53:32,305 --> 00:53:40,977
Then the organism goes backwards and is going to reach the place where it started.

354
00:53:42,105 --> 00:53:45,041
It will reach the place of ulcerative colitis.

355
00:53:56,889 --> 00:54:10,914
His kidneys are going down, his blood is not clean, he has toxicity; because of toxicity he has sleepiness etc.

356
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:34,472
What you will see is that the side effects of the kidney problems which are bronchitis, sleepiness etc.
are reduced until the time the whole organism will go back to the original state which was the colitis.

357
00:54:36,497 --> 00:54:49,561
You are like children, I feel I have to say it again and again… These things are essential that you have to understand.

358
00:54:52,369 --> 00:55:02,841
For me it’s so obvious and then I have to transfer this knowledge and I see your eyes, what is he saying?

359
00:55:05,624 --> 00:55:08,416
Did he really mean this or that?

360
00:55:09,945 --> 00:55:18,712
And each one thinks about himself is this guy crazy?

361
00:55:20,521 --> 00:55:25,120
I was joking but I perceive that.
