1
00:00:23,534 --> 00:00:31,622
We had agreed that you start immediately with the beginning of a new crisis

2
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:41,663
but the remedy was not prepared yet so you waited for a week before you started it.

3
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:49,129
During that week the albumin was quite ... - Low, it was reduced very fast and when gets

4
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:56,817
The albumin which comes out... - It’s just albumin I’m leaking.

5
00:00:57,137 --> 00:01:15,545
The globulins and all the proteins are not leaking. – How fast was the leaking?

6
00:01:15,745 --> 00:01:32,215
In the first week it was quite high. – Before, I was leaking a little bit. It was a mild situation.

7
00:01:34,263 --> 00:01:45,607
I didn’t take any medication and during this week I was waiting for the remedy.

8
00:01:45,895 --> 00:01:54,455
I ran new lab tests and my albumin ran down really fast from 40 to 28

9
00:01:54,694 --> 00:02:03,576
and then it was under 20 and then I started having the edemas.

10
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:11,446
I gained about 10 kilos during that week. When I was waking up in the morning

11
00:02:11,623 --> 00:02:18,302
the edema was concentrated in the face, underneath the eyes and then it went down under

12
00:02:19,359 --> 00:02:30,558
my belly and when I walked it was down in the ankles. I had to do something about it

13
00:02:30,766 --> 00:02:41,071
because my homeopath was in touch with you and we agreed to distinguish

14
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:45,575
the medical situation, so I went to the hospital and had

15
00:02:46,215 --> 00:03:06,622
an injection of SENDOXAN (Cyclophosphamide). They usually use it for cancer cases.

16
00:03:07,295 --> 00:03:15,966
I took it intravenously and this is very strong medication they give me, but just for one day.

17
00:03:18,367 --> 00:03:29,671
Then it took about a week for the protein to gradually stop leaking.

18
00:03:30,006 --> 00:03:37,358
And then the albumin level started to raise, we took new tests, then I urinated very much

19
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:46,631
and I lost the weight very fast. I went down those 10 kg.

20
00:03:51,023 --> 00:04:04,999
After a period I gradually got more energy and I am not so tired anymore.

21
00:04:05,215 --> 00:04:16,679
We took new tests after a period of time and they said that my hemoglobin was always

22
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:25,231
too low but it started to raise. It used to be 17 and now it is more than 18.

23
00:04:25,687 --> 00:04:30,943
My orthostatic blood pressure has been a bad situation for me.

24
00:04:33,262 --> 00:04:49,614
It still goes down but in general it is higher and I am very happy about that.

25
00:04:52,526 --> 00:05:02,551
Except from that I can notice that I urinate more frequently during the night.

26
00:05:03,655 --> 00:05:13,183
When I go to bed at 11 p.m. I usually wake up at 1 and 3 a.m. and I urinate very much.

27
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:19,062
Also at 6 a.m. At least 3 times a night. – What I notice very much is that you

28
00:05:19,223 --> 00:05:30,239
don’t feel so sleepy anymore.  – I feel more energy, definitely.  – And you stay more awake,

29
00:05:30,494 --> 00:05:39,950
you attend almost the whole class now. – As far as the heat is concerned,

30
00:05:42,671 --> 00:05:52,983
very hot makes me feel very weak and tired.  – You don’t like the heat here?

31
00:05:57,087 --> 00:06:08,704
– If I stay long time in the sun I feel very tired and weak. As far as the cold weather

32
00:06:09,007 --> 00:06:25,776
is concerned, if it is too cold and humid I am freezing very fast. I tolerate heat as long as

33
00:06:26,087 --> 00:06:38,559
it is not too hot. – Any other change? – Another thing I have noticed is that

34
00:06:40,991 --> 00:06:54,231
the loose stool and the diarrhea that used to be very frequent , now my stool is better

35
00:06:54,790 --> 00:07:02,790
except for certain food I am sensitive to. I am sensitive to white flour,

36
00:07:05,831 --> 00:07:17,831
red meat and special food. Except from that I am pretty good concerning the stool.

37
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:31,551
– The stool is more formed? – Yes. Before it was loose all the time and it changed

38
00:07:31,886 --> 00:07:43,679
from loose to diarrhea. Now I have little diarrhea and loose stool when I eat milky products,

39
00:07:46,846 --> 00:07:54,990
flour and certain times the red meat. Except from that my bowel movement

40
00:07:55,447 --> 00:08:02,175
is ok and the stool is formed. That’s better.

41
00:08:02,391 --> 00:08:13,847
Because from having this diarrhea and loose stool all the time I was very much exhausted.

42
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:26,735
I took new lab tests now just before I came to you and they have never been

43
00:08:27,095 --> 00:08:38,583
as good as they are now. My albumin level was 38

44
00:08:42,902 --> 00:08:57,759
and my hemoglobin has been raised a little bit. My kidney function is very good.

45
00:08:58,014 --> 00:09:09,095
The creatinine is perfect, no sedimentation rate is about 20. A little high.

46
00:09:09,319 --> 00:09:29,239
– The first it was 20 and the second hour? – They have different measurements for that

47
00:09:30,287 --> 00:09:41,775
in Norway but it states that the normal should be 4-12 if you are completely balanced.

48
00:09:41,975 --> 00:09:50,056
But my sedimentation had been up to 40 and now is 20 so it’s a good reduction rate.

49
00:09:53,766 --> 00:10:02,782
I know medical specialists very good; they are also patients of mine so every time

50
00:10:02,975 --> 00:10:08,742
I go to the hospital they talk about their own problem too!

51
00:10:09,182 --> 00:10:19,935
Another thing I had was a problem with the chest, pain in the chest and down to

52
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:32,495
the left arm. I went to the hospital and the ECG under pressure was normal.

53
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:41,024
I know I had a very bad scoliosis in the thorax and when I get a little stress

54
00:10:41,206 --> 00:10:47,486
my second thoracic gets very fixed, I can feel that right away.

55
00:10:52,527 --> 00:11:00,703
I notice that in my family too when I take x-rays all my family they have the same scoliosis

56
00:11:00,886 --> 00:11:08,902
in that part. There are different symptoms but we have tendency to the same problems.

57
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:17,190
I eliminated that I didn’t have a coronary disease. But when I get this fixed,

58
00:11:17,366 --> 00:11:32,231
correct it, manipulate it, it usually takes care of it. Let me think if can think

59
00:11:32,855 --> 00:11:54,798
about anything else which is different... - Since June you had this crisis, now it is September,

60
00:11:55,086 --> 00:12:13,718
4 months... - The only I have been taking is this herb and that’s why I get these lab tests.

61
00:12:13,894 --> 00:12:19,830
But the concentration in the blood is very very low and I like to get rid of that.

62
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:46,263
– How frequently you have these peaks? – I am not sure. If I get off this herb then it usually

63
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:55,846
has lasted 1 or 2 weeks then I start leaking a little bit. What I do then is take 100

64
00:12:57,247 --> 00:13:09,023
in the morning and 100 in the evening. I double it for about a week and then I stabilize.

65
00:13:14,487 --> 00:13:29,047
They gave me a choice and I didn’t like the cortisone. They say there are no side effects

66
00:13:31,063 --> 00:13:38,070
with that little dose but what I am concerned about is my kidney function

67
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:45,175
which continues to be as good as now which is functional. They say the only side-effects

68
00:13:46,127 --> 00:13:57,455
for that one is that you get more hairy. I don’t know but I want to get rid of it.

69
00:13:58,574 --> 00:14:18,646
Except from that every 4-5 month I get a little relapse. This is can get rid of right away;

70
00:14:19,095 --> 00:14:25,959
I have little concentration of that cyclosporine.

71
00:14:32,518 --> 00:14:39,214
– When the edemas come where they appear first, the feet or the face?

72
00:14:39,823 --> 00:14:44,663
– It always starts in the face, when I wake up in the morning.

73
00:14:46,022 --> 00:14:55,639
It depends how I am laying, if I am laying on the head then it comes in the body,

74
00:14:55,895 --> 00:15:04,439
but when I am lying on the one side, then when I am looking in the mirror

75
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:11,646
that one side is bigger than the other. Usually I can see. Now even though I am not leaking ,

76
00:15:14,927 --> 00:15:20,031
when I wake up in the morning there is little underneath the eyes.

77
00:15:21,615 --> 00:15:35,935
I don’t know if that’s normal... it goes down later. If I don’t stop it I am feeling like

78
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:44,918
I am floating when I walk, I hate that feeling because I usually exercise every day,

79
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:54,703
I take a walk every day and in my clinic I have a training sector so I make exercise for

80
00:15:54,974 --> 00:16:03,318
half an hour or 40 minutes. Just easy exercises. That’s good for me.

81
00:16:03,887 --> 00:16:10,415
– Is there anything else that you feel that has changed? You need more water

82
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:25,191
or you are more thirsty or you eat something different? – I feel I can eat more of different

83
00:16:25,975 --> 00:16:39,551
food now than before without getting the loose stool. I also don’t have so much gas

84
00:16:40,903 --> 00:16:59,943
in the stomach. It’s much better. But as far as drinking is concerned I drink regularly

85
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:12,696
during the day but I am not extremely thirsty, I drink normally.

86
00:17:14,703 --> 00:17:23,167
I don’t drink anything else than water, no alcohol, no smoking.

87
00:17:29,807 --> 00:17:41,424
When I am sitting and then I start to walk and getting up I got so dry in the mouth,

88
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:52,079
extremely dry, no saliva at all. It’s like I am under some kind of a stress situation.

89
00:17:52,463 --> 00:17:58,638
I feel the blood coming down and I really have to concentrate not to faint.

90
00:17:59,254 --> 00:18:16,367
But still I get over that phase faster than before. When I am lying,

91
00:18:17,102 --> 00:18:26,582
I sit a bit on the bed and then I stand up and start to walk. This system seems to work out.

92
00:18:28,615 --> 00:18:39,110
– I would like you to continue with the Acetanilidum C12 once a day.

93
00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:48,471
You continue for 1 month, then we’ll see how things are and then after a month

94
00:18:49,903 --> 00:19:04,679
they will prepare one potency higher, if they can; C13. And then C14 etc...

95
00:19:04,903 --> 00:19:13,496
Every month you go one potency higher. They can prepare in one of the laboratories.

96
00:19:21,991 --> 00:19:31,510
Now, you can start once a day with C12 and then every month you go one higher.

97
00:19:32,111 --> 00:19:38,760
For 2-3 months we go this way then we get the feedback on how you feel and then

98
00:19:38,951 --> 00:19:50,647
I will tell you how you continue further. Once we see the organism is better and steady,

99
00:19:51,759 --> 00:20:11,615
not leaking then you start reducing this by ¼ , ½ and by ¾. – I am not leaking now,

100
00:20:15,198 --> 00:20:24,956
I start to reduce it? – Yes once you start with this you can start to reduce it by ¼.

101
00:20:25,556 --> 00:20:27,964
– Now I get 100 in the morning and 100 in the evening

102
00:20:28,292 --> 00:20:34,692
so I will get 100 in the morning and 50 in the evening. – For one month.

103
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:42,699
– And then I go to 50 – 50 and then I’ll try to reduce it this way. That’s the way I will do it.

104
00:20:43,067 --> 00:20:56,371
If I get a relapse during that time...? – If you get a relapse you will have to raise the potency,

105
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:05,938
that means first of all raise the potency like 15C immediately, 16C,

106
00:21:06,211 --> 00:21:16,211
every day a potency higher but 3-4 times a day, not once. You take 3-4 times a day

107
00:21:16,603 --> 00:21:33,382
and every second day raise the potency. When you go back you order to prepare 13C

108
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:41,462
up to 20C. One pharmacy will raise it for you and you have it.

109
00:21:46,165 --> 00:21:52,917
– I take one potency for a whole month. – But if you start leaking make it much faster.
