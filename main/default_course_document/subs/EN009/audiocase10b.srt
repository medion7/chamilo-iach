1
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,470
This was a difficult case.

2
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:37,960
I remember I had a problem with the class explaining, I don't know who has the notes,

3
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:42,820
that I'm going to give a remedy which I cannot very well justify.

4
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:51,210
As you remember I read several possibilities also in the class

5
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:58,070
but yet I did not really like any of them.

6
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:20,220
There was a point which was quite strong and that was aggravation from heat,

7
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,570
amelioration from cold blowing air.

8
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:51,580
This man also appears to me to be older than he really is and also he was complaining

9
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:58,920
at a later stage about his skin which makes wrinkles.

10
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,080
-How old is he?

11
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:20,900
-He is 46 but the idea is that he gives you an impression of being old, no power,

12
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,250
no stamina.

13
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,340
So the remedy I prescribed was...

14
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:47,640
...Secale cornutum.

15
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,580
I think there are several follow ups.

16
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,580
Next time I saw him...

17
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:29,080
-It was during the seminar in 87 next year.

18
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,750
-Do you have any follow ups here?

19
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,410
-Can you give the reasoning more for Secale?

20
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:06,580
-We do not have at all information about the psychology of Secale.

21
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:15,230
It's never given, never written but what I know from previous cases

22
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:19,700
that I have seen on Secale, I have not seen exactly that syndrome.

23
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,580
What I have seen is a weakening of the mental powers.

24
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:40,980
A kind of stagnation of the circulation, as if the circulatory system becomes stagnant

25
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,580
without power to force the circulation.

26
00:04:46,570 --> 00:05:00,980
As a result of that stagnation I have seen for instance a kind of varicose vein situation,

27
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:10,730
where the legs may become extremely warm, they are swelling and they are painful,

28
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:23,230
especially having a pain which is round, like a strip around the arm or around the leg.

29
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:32,480
But the main thing is that they are ameliorated by cold air and they are much worse by heat.

30
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:38,470
This stagnation produces a state of confusion in the mind

31
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:44,470
and that confusion can be expressed as this man is expressing it in this case

32
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:48,590
or it can be expressed...

33
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:56,730
That means you perceive the confusion but the person is not able to describe

34
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:06,060
that actually I have a confusion, as if living inside a kind of cloud.

35
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:17,320
As if they do not have a direct perception of reality.

36
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,070
In general as if the circulation had stagnated in the brain.

37
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:34,150
How one could feel, you can imagine as if the circulation is stopped.

38
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:40,650
The circulation gives life to the brain and stops, still keeps it alive without life.

39
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,640
Just being alive.

40
00:06:49,660 --> 00:07:00,640
It was a very difficult decision for me because I could not show to the students through the books.

41
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,290
I was leaving all the other remedies which appeared to be better

42
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:08,650
and still I didn't choose them and why.

43
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:17,390
-What about this difference...

44
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:22,400
-Most probably.

45
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:42,760
This formication and tinkling in the eyes, the stips were there, the pains around the arms and legs.

46
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:02,760
-Unreal, that the world appears unreal to him.

47
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:14,590
Whether this is a Secale symptom? What do you want to ask?

48
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,350
How is that goes with Secale?

49
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,500
We do not know, that is what I'm saying.

50
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:30,340
We do not have the symptomatology on Secale on mental-emotional level.

51
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:46,250
What I have perceived is circulatory stagnation, which may explain...

52
00:08:46,350 --> 00:09:00,750
it's a slowed up circulation, it's very difficult to explain in a physiological manner,

53
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:04,240
the action of the remedy.

54
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:09,090
Because we do not have enough information and this is building up

55
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:12,420
some information about the remedy.

56
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:30,160
Onosmodium is very close and Selenium also because there is definitely a sexual neurasthenia,

57
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,260
a sexual preoccupation.

58
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:40,480
Is he sexually preoccupied? Everybody can see that.

59
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:49,340
Preoccupied almost all the time with his sexual behavior.

60
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,740
I have seen this kind of masturbation which starts from the very young age

61
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:03,830
to an age of 45-46, I have seen it with Staphysagria...

62
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:10,090
Staphysagria can produce a kind of this type.

63
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:24,090
It produces a feeling as if the brain is like wood, that feeling is in the occiput.

64
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:33,230
Staphysagria was given to him without any effect

65
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:40,730
and Staphysagria is not such a warm remedy and what impressed me is that kind of stagnation

66
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,830
which I have noticed in other cases of Secale.

67
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:59,080
Secale has no symptoms at all, we don't know the Secale symptoms...

68
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:18,740
Secale has a special action upon the genitalia, ergotamine.

69
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:28,190
It was a remedy that was given to produce an abortion.

70
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:46,250
-How is going to affect the male?
-We don't know.

71
00:11:53,250 --> 00:12:04,830
Did you find any follow up?
-We have the analysis.

72
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:24,730
-It is quite an ordeal. He went through different phases.

73
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:34,230
This man came with a lot of crying, at a certain period of time we thought Secale

74
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:39,830
was not working and we gave Mercurialis perennis.

75
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:52,740
He said afterwards although it was Secale, I became worse, without knowing exactly

76
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,340
that we changed the remedy.

77
00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:03,480
And we went back to Secale but during that period it is very interesting to see

78
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:09,730
that he go to a state where he cannot eat, he cannot swallow anything, he cries all the time,

79
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,920
he cries a lot.

80
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:28,550
There is a crying like a child almost, a self-pity and tremendous concern about himself,

81
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:37,040
about the sexuality and all the things we have been talking about.

82
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:46,400
Much more accentuated, so finally do you remember when you gave last time Secale?

83
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:23,390
I think you gave once more Secale, you don't remember Peter.

84
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:35,180
I will see the correspondence but very seldom I make mistakes in remembering.

85
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,350
How high was the Secale? 200.

86
00:14:52,610 --> 00:15:01,850
After Mercurialis he did not do well and either you repeated or I repeated in Alonissos.

87
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:09,070
Definitely he got one more dose of Secale later.

88
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:31,410
-In higher potencies is not justifiable?

89
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:40,310
-It is yes but it has been given later on, he was given Lycopodium again,

90
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:48,650
he asked himself and he was given by the practitioner and if you remember he said,

91
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,980
it sent him into an aggravation where he lost the reality.

92
00:15:54,250 --> 00:16:00,730
For weeks he was not feeling real, the world was unreal after Lycopodium.

93
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:19,140
Simply what he meant is he took two doses of Lycopodium and went into that state.

94
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:25,740
Once you got that information you are very careful to prescribe Lycopodium again.

95
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:33,640
-One of the argument for the Picric acid might be that after Lycopodium

96
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:41,130
he had these sustained erections, that Lycopodium brought out this state of Picric acid.

97
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:49,140
Picric acid has suppressed sexual desire, as well as masturbation,

98
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:55,640
which gives the sexual picture reasonably well because we don't know the mentals...

99
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,490
It can make an argument for Lycopodium...

100
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:10,130
-That is the problem we are having because we are trying to find

101
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:16,040
the best possible prescription for him and I read to you several possibilities

102
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:24,560
and you agreed that all the possibilities were feasible and still I was not satisfied.

103
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:31,750
In this case I do not expect that you will find Secale.

104
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:37,040
It is because I have some knowledge with Secale cases and Selenium

105
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:46,040
and I was able to differentiate actually without being able to point out the symptomatology,

106
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,790
what was that which made me decide for Secale.

107
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:54,890
I think I said the same thing two years ago when I first took his case.

108
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:06,790
But what is this that makes me not decide on that remedy or that remedy?

109
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:11,140
I do not feel a Picric acid.

110
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:27,210
A Picric acid is mostly affected in his mental but you can talk with him for five minutes

111
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:35,210
and it's perfect, the sixth minute is tired and from then on he will not understand

112
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:37,070
what you are talking about.

113
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:44,960
That means it has to have the element of exertion, mental exertion to go for Picric acid

114
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:49,930
and it has to be strong, it cannot sustain any kind of effort.

115
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:56,880
What we see here is a complex which is much deeper, we have emotional,

116
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:59,880
mental and physical problems.

117
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:08,880
In general all these are in a weak state, the whole organism is in a weak state

118
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,720
and what happens with the brain.

119
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,860
It seems that there is a kind of stagnation; this is how I perceived it anyhow.

120
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:25,120
It's a poetic expression I'm using but I can't give you more information of what I know.

121
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:36,460
This man is quite ill, he is a mental case but it's not only a mental case, he is mental,

122
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:45,050
emotional and physical because he does not have energy to run and to go and to do things.

123
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:55,000
What I know is it's going to take long time before we can really bring about results

124
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,330
in such a case and we have to wait quite a long time.

125
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:13,180
-If he did not have Lycopodium before should you give it?

126
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:21,290
-No, my mind went to remedies such  as I read to you. I did not read Secale, it doesn't matter

127
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:25,350
but these are the remedies that my mind went.

128
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:31,950
Knowing the Materia Medica my mind will go to such remedies.

129
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:45,950
What I perceive in this man is this deep disturbance in him and I would expect

130
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:49,530
when he is saying I'm better...

131
00:20:52,530 --> 00:21:01,600
This is a man who is out of work from 79 to 86, for 7 years.

132
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:05,200
He cannot work, he is exhausted.

133
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:12,600
What I want to see is that the whole organism is coming back, the stamina is coming back

134
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,700
and he will start working again.

135
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:21,330
This is the test whether he will be better or not.

136
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:34,430
He is complaining in the whole interview, the complaint was tremendous, he was crying,

137
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:40,780
I cannot eat, I want to die, there is a time where he cannot swallow.

138
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:45,270
Eat, I can't swallow, it doesn't go down he says.

139
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,270
Now the last interview.

140
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:15,120
-He was emotionally after 6 months he gets this I cannot understand why he got a second remedy.

141
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:20,720
-Because there was a time where he was complaining very much.

142
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:33,220
I thought that maybe I had evaluated wrongly the situation and I gave another remedy.

143
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:40,880
-The first consultation you have seen was during the Alonissos seminar in 86.

144
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:45,200
Then another practitioner attended the case, as you might have seen.

145
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:54,390
He was a teacher in a school and he was treated by another practitioner at that time.

146
00:22:55,140 --> 00:23:03,790
These two practitioners were teaching in the same school, so for decided to give Gelsemium

147
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:11,030
and after this patient, one of the participants here a few months later,

148
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:16,640
he experienced that he didn't get the remedy that George gave him, which was the Secale.

149
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:23,210
Then at that time he was given the Secale 200 and I must be clear about it,

150
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:29,480
he experienced dramatic amelioration of energy and psychologically.

151
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:39,570
Then 6 months later during the Alonissos seminar of the Norwegians he came to visit George

152
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:46,150
and then there was this pitiful, emotional state in which there was decided

153
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:53,760
to give the Mercurialis perenis 200, which didn't have real effect I think.

154
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,730
Afterwards, because he stayed to Alonissos,

155
00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:03,080
George gave him the Mercurialis perennis 6X during 2-3 weeks.

156
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:10,240
Now I took off the case during the International Seminar in September last year

157
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:16,150
and he had in my practice during the last year.

158
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:21,400
In November in one of the consultations he was crying continuously almost

159
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:27,650
and being in a kind of Pulsatilla state and I phoned George at that time.

160
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:32,910
I said these and these are the symptoms and he was crying very strongly,

161
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:41,650
he was warm blooded too and there was a possibility of Pulsatilla

162
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:49,160
but because he was longing for the Secale so much, like for the Lycopodium,

163
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:54,650
he was asking for his second shot of energy with the Secale,

164
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:58,650
we decided to give him sac lac and call it Secale.

165
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:08,290
Then after this Secale he got better for 1-2 days in energy and then he explained

166
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:14,070
that he got worse again because he inhaled some eucalyptus fumes.

167
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:23,150
This happened a few times and I thought the remedy was antidoted by circumstances.

168
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:34,300
To my experience the Secale and the Mercurialis to my understanding didn't have much effect

169
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:41,560
but in theory you might have the conjecture that the Mercurialis had done the job.

170
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:45,410
After the Mercurialis I could not see much or any improvement at all.

171
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:50,750
So this was the story, he did have Secale after the Mercurialis.

172
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:07,070
-Mercurialis did nothing, from the reports I was getting there was any effect.

173
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:13,900
From the Mercurialis he went into an aggravation and he was asking for Secale again and again

174
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,890
and I was under the impression and still am that he got a second dose of Secale.

175
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:26,640
But if Peter did not give it, this is a problem of international communications

176
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:31,500
and misunderstandings.

177
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:45,150
What is interesting also is that after Secale he gave reports where his energy

178
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:55,750
was much stronger and you will see now in last week what he said.

179
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:59,160
This is the last follow up that we have.

180
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:14,420
About one and a half year since the first Secale.

181
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:56,910
-I have something I have done myself, maybe I should give it to you first.

182
00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:10,390
-Read me first your overall impression of how you are doing with your health in general.

183
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,640
Just give me a general impression.

184
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:16,490
-I think generally I'm much better than last year.

185
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:33,700
My arms was about because next to Homeopathy I'm doing some other things.

186
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,130
-What are you doing?

187
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:48,380
-I call it meditation. I sit in my chair and...

188
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,210
-And you try with your mind?

189
00:28:53,310 --> 00:29:03,720
-There are two things. One is that I say all kind of positive things like you are going to be well

190
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:12,960
and let everything old in the past go away of you, you are full of energy today

191
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:19,490
and today is the best day of your life, these kind of things saying to myself.

192
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:23,230
-And it's helping?
-Yes.

193
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,330
-Very good.

194
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:39,500
Again the same story, all this happens after the homeopathic remedy, that's a coincidence.

195
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:44,000
Do you think he is really doing better because he is saying that?

196
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:52,680
What he implies is I don't know about the remedy but I'm doing this and I feel

197
00:29:52,780 --> 00:30:04,190
that this is why I'm better. What do you think? You are afraid to say now?

198
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:06,360
Let's say that many of you think that maybe.

199
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,200
Let us see if it actually happens.

200
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,200
-Apart from that are you working?

201
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,190
Just go back a little bit.

202
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:59,280
-I'm not working but I started a kind of voluntary job last September,

203
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:04,260
so I work now for two days the week.

204
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,870
-What is this job?

205
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:20,360
-We collect old tools, repair them and are going to Africa, middle South America.

206
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:28,620
-Very good. Do you like this job, do you enjoy it?

207
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:38,460
-I started because I thought I had to do something, not to sit.

208
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:46,510
So I started to like it, I started to like people that work there

209
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:54,510
that I have said to myself I will do this for one year and then I will see what I will do next.

210
00:31:54,610 --> 00:32:05,100
So to go to find myself a normal job, a paid job because this voluntarily job

211
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:13,440
is too voluntarily, whether I come in 9 or 10 o'clock it doesn't matter.

212
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:21,820
I don't care for the payment because I have good allowance but they can tell me

213
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:25,530
you have to be there at 9 and do this, do that.

214
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:31,950
-Whether you will be able to do that.
-Yes to test it.

215
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,500
-Very good idea.
-I think I can stand it now.

216
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:45,100
You see the difference? Forget about in and out, the brain, all that is past.

217
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:55,250
Now what he wants is to stop playing and get a proper job.

218
00:32:55,350 --> 00:33:01,760
And as he said he had been doing a voluntarily job that was light and easy

219
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:09,250
but the fact that he says I'm planning now to go to a proper job, this is the sign

220
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:18,510
that we have finally reached the state where we should be approaching a good health.

221
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:24,350
Let us hear him a bit more.

222
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:42,750
-You look very much better.
-I feel very much better, that is true.

223
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:48,350
-Tell me now the other aspect of your life, the emotional aspect, how is that?

224
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,830
What is happening in that aspect?

225
00:33:52,930 --> 00:34:07,010
-I think on the physical plane that is where I'm much better but emotionally I don't know exactly.

226
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:15,430
Three months ago I broke up with my girlfriend, that is what happened.

227
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:23,840
-Three months ago he broke with his girlfriend and he says emotionally I don't know where I am.

228
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,430
What do you think?

229
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:32,360
Emotionally is worse?
-Better.

230
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:37,100
-Nobody says worse?
-Much better.

231
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:51,590
-He finally after one year he found the courage to break the relationship.

232
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:03,350
Emotionally he says I do not know, let us hear.

233
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:09,000
-That is what happened emotionally.

234
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:15,730
-Three months ago. This girlfriend is the same that you had two years ago?

235
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,340
-Yes it's the same.

236
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,720
-Did you break several times with her?

237
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:23,720
-She broke several times with me, now I broke once.

238
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:31,730
-You decided this time.
-Yes, more or less yes.

239
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:41,390
It is not so simple. I decided to tell her the truth about what was going on between us

240
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:46,270
and during that conversation I decided that...

241
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:47,520
-You wanted to leave.

242
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:52,010
-I wanted to leave because she had definite plans with her life

243
00:35:52,110 --> 00:36:00,270
and the plans were she wanted to get married and have a child and I was not up to that.

244
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:11,770
I was not ready for that and I think there was not enough love. So this time I said we stop.

245
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:17,530
-In the meantime you had found another girl that you like?

246
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,600
-Not yet.

247
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:22,960
-Tell me the truth.
-No, not yet.

248
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:30,690
-But you have something in mind?
-No I haven't. I have no girl in mind.

249
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:43,580
This is an encouraging sign because in spite of the fact he does not have another crutch

250
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:48,590
he decides I had enough, we cannot continue.

251
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:57,350
That shows that the strength is returning to him and he can handle situations.

252
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:14,860
-These three months now that you are without a girlfriend how do you cope with the situation?

253
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,430
It is too painful for you or it is all right?

254
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:37,240
-The first few weeks were a kind of relief, a burden was falling of me and then there are weeks

255
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:45,720
when I missed the things we were doing with her, she was a very good friend.

256
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:51,970
We liked the same things going to museums or opera or dancing, going bicycling

257
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:57,650
and I said to myself where do I find a girl like that, that likes to sleep in a little tent

258
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:01,490
and go bicycling 100 kilometers.

259
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:12,140
You see during the time of the course that he was complaining, he was taking the bus

260
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:18,130
for Holland to France bicycling. I said who can do these things?

261
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:23,490
Not someone who is almost paralyzed the way he appeared in the beginning?

262
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:39,740
-...and go bicycling for 100 km, it's not easy to get but I think it has been a good decision.

263
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:44,990
It wouldn't work out.

264
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,990
-How old are you now?
-I'm 48.

265
00:38:57,490 --> 00:39:02,650
-How is your energy level now?

266
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:13,230
-I think it's much better but it is still going up and down.

267
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:23,140
Only the going down is every time a little bit less deep than the time before.

268
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,770
That's the idea I have about it.

269
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:36,140
Sometimes there are days that I feel so good and so strong like in March that I was going skiing.

270
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:42,390
I was skiing with youngsters who were 25 years old and I could just keep up with them

271
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:45,240
and that surprised me very much.

272
00:39:46,740 --> 00:40:00,570
But still is the meditation. I don't whether he meditates while he is skiing, maybe.

273
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:23,820
-These days I haven't been so strong but generally the energy is like waves but upward trend.

274
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:32,050
-How long you sleep?

275
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:41,050
-Most of the times I sleep quite normally. I go to bed, fall asleep, hardly wake up.

276
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:48,310
-So you are refreshed in the morning?
-I'm normally refreshed.

277
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:58,940
Because of meditation?

278
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:13,450
-I feel a little bit tired but not such a problem. Only one thing that the times

279
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:18,300
I felt very good I had a definite sleeping position.

280
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,620
-What position?

281
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:32,630
-It was on my side and one hand under the right pillow and when I felt worse

282
00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:41,280
I was lying on my abdomen and that's how I sleep now though I feel much better.

283
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:49,670
-You sleep on abdomen mostly with the hand under the head?

284
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:51,520
-Yes.

285
00:41:55,250 --> 00:42:06,150
-How is your appetite?
-The last time I couldn't eat was on last December.

286
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:12,410
There was one morning I couldn't eat at all and then that lasted until March,

287
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:17,150
until the winter sports that I had problems with eating in the morning.

288
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:19,170
But now there is no problem with eating at all.

289
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:26,810
-You have a good appetite, you eat a fair amount?
-I eat a fair amount yes.

290
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:31,410
-Do you want to put more weight?
-No, I want to lose weight.

291
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:37,820
-Do you remember when crying and asking me whether you will be able to eat again?

292
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:44,340
Now you want to lose weight. It's terrible, now that you want to lose weight,

293
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:47,350
I will not let you to lose weight.

294
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:54,270
-I have to stop the coca-cola then or the beers.

295
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,100
-You drink beer a lot?

296
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:06,920
-Not a lot. I never was able to drink a lot but I drink five beers.

297
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,520
-Five bottles of beer?

298
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:21,760
-These glasses that you drink in Holland about a quarter of lit but it's not much.

299
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:42,390
I know they drink 50 or 60 or 70 glasses of beer and I don't drink them every day of course

300
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:46,990
and when I have five glasses I can feel it.

301
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:55,320
-How is your relationship with other people, with friends? How is that aspect?

302
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:04,670
-I think I have some very good friends, only most of them are girlfriends

303
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:13,140
and that hasn't changed very much that time and they like me and I like them.

304
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,240
That's all I can say about it.

305
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:29,150
You see the way he describes? The whole thing he forgot, he does not remember.

306
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:40,330
He only say I feel better but if he could decide he would say I'm still the same.

307
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:43,480
You can hear these things, the difference can be so much

308
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:49,610
and still the patient will say I'm the same.

309
00:44:52,830 --> 00:45:00,090
-When I came to Greece I went sailing 14 days before going to Aidipsos

310
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:10,170
and they were nine people on board and a skipper, me and another male and six girls.

311
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:21,070
Then I always am afraid that being the eldest of course I'm not accepted but I'm always accepted.

312
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:32,490
There never has been a problem, they always accept me, the strange thing is

313
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:34,590
that I always worry about that.

314
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:37,340
-What would you say at this moment is the problem that you want to improve

315
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:50,480
concerning your health?

316
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:57,970
What is the point in your health that you would say I'd like to improve more that point.

317
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:11,230
-I think the problems that I came with are not totally solved yet. They are still weakness.

318
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:17,630
-That means you want to feel more energy, correct?

319
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:19,170
-Yes.

320
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:30,130
He compares with a man 25 years old skier and he wants more energy, that's nice.

321
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:33,560
If I can give him that, I would get it myself.

322
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:49,060
So we can go on teaching indefinitely, we don't have to stop now. Why?

323
00:46:54,810 --> 00:47:08,650
-What else? You feel you have enough energy now but you feel still you can go more.

324
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:12,870
-I think I'm not on my normal level.

325
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:17,220
-Yes but how many years you have been sick?

326
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:26,120
-I've been sick from 84, when I started Homeopathy in 84

327
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:39,730
but that was just for my psoriasis I think but the real problems were at 85,86.

328
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:50,120
I know I can have more energy because there are those days where I feel like my normal self.

329
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:15,720
I don't know what to do.

330
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,300
-Anything else?

331
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:37,890
Emotionally do you feel balanced? Do you feel at ease with yourself?

332
00:48:44,810 --> 00:48:55,310
-That is difficult to say. I think I have never been emotionally balanced enough.

333
00:48:56,300 --> 00:49:02,200
-Yes but comparing with the things you had in the past, you remember all these blockages

334
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:05,970
and everything which was happening. Do you remember?

335
00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:16,730
-I remember the second time when I saw you I was crying and crying.

336
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:51,220
-The first time also you were crying.
-I don't remember.

337
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:57,310
-In Alonissos, it was two years ago.

338
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:08,470
I don't remember whether he was crying in the consultation but this man was after me

339
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:16,960
every day and he was asking me different things and then he was crying and I'm better...

340
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:22,460
You see I've taken his case but every day in Alonissos he gives me a follow up.

341
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:28,730
I couldn't remember whether he was crying in the interview or...

342
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:51,230
-Then I wasn't even so bad than what it occurred to me later on.

343
00:50:54,710 --> 00:51:01,360
-You have forgotten how you were. I will show you one day the details to remind you.

344
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:11,040
-Yes but I know that 3-4 months later it was worse for me than when I saw you in Alonissos.

345
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:22,180
What took place after Gelsemium the situation was very much aggravated

346
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:31,440
and he developed a difficulty to swallow. By that time he would cry constantly.

347
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:37,530
In the whole interview he was crying and crying.

348
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:50,700
-You remember that?

349
00:51:50,800 --> 00:52:02,040
-Yes but I was sitting in my chair, even breathing costed too much energy then.

350
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:09,680
Do you see the expression, breathing costed much energy, how tired he was.

351
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:22,290
He goes skiing, walks for hours... due to meditation.

352
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:32,540
-I think Secale was the problem. I didn't have Secale then in September, if you remember.

353
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:51,190
-I'm very happy with the condition in which you are. It is quite balanced, not totally

354
00:52:51,290 --> 00:53:02,920
balanced, still we have some work to do but I'm very happy that you are doing quite well.

355
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:04,920
-So am I.

356
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:10,770
-Finally we can say that we are happy both of us, me more than you,

357
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:16,760
I don't know how much happy you are but I'm more happy than you.

358
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:25,670
The main thing now is you go back to your normal life now, if you get a job

359
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:33,580
and you see that you can cope, to have a new girlfriend, to fix your life.

360
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:42,340
As long as coffees and take strong medicines and all that.

361
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:54,590
Don't believe that anybody on earth has perfect health. Don't go for perfect health.

362
00:53:56,430 --> 00:54:02,580
See how much you can improve, this is our goal

363
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:15,500
but what you said that comparing with youngsters you were skiing, it's not anybody

364
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:21,090
who is almost 50 can compare with people who are 25.

365
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:22,830
-That is true but...

366
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:26,790
-And don't want to be all the time in that form.

367
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:36,500
-No, I don't have to, I know that but something is telling me...

368
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:43,270
-That you can still improve.
-Yes, I know it.

369
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:55,100
-I'm glad that you improved and I will tell Peter how to continue,

370
00:54:57,330 --> 00:55:01,260
I hope next year to see you with much more strength.

371
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:11,760
-I'll be there, wherever. Thank you.
-Thank you.

372
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:21,680
-I just want to ask a question about the progress I make, is it the Secale

373
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:24,180
or is it the other things I'm doing?

374
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:36,420
-Both. Later on also your job is going to play a part in your health.

375
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:42,670
When you have a job you feel that you are doing something constructive, creative.

376
00:55:42,770 --> 00:55:50,000
It's going to be a positive factor in your health. When you have a relationship

377
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:58,360
is going to be a positive factor for your health. All these things go together.

378
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:06,020
It's not only the remedy, it's what happens around the person and if you have a positive attitude,

379
00:56:09,350 --> 00:56:10,850
this is what you want.

380
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:23,250
-The last 14 days sailing I was rather good and this week I went down,

381
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:37,350
I noticed, the skin became wrinkled. Now it is normal here.

382
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:46,750
The last two days I say these things to myself, I love my life and that's

383
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:49,520
why tonight I feel better...

384
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:59,760
-The last two days he was doing the meditation and that's why he is better. I see.
