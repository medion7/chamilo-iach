00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:16,000
Case study 003

2
00:00:26,448 --> 00:00:47,339
Thank you! Thank you for your warm welcome
and I would also like to welcome you

3
00:00:47,351 --> 00:01:07,209
all and wish you a period that may be
significant for the rest of your life.

4
00:01:19,736 --> 00:01:32,939
As I have been informed a lot of you are coming from
the first time in Homeopathy and you have been already

5
00:01:32,951 --> 00:01:46,777
medical doctors for years, practicing conventional medicine,
you may find it difficult to adapt in the beginning.

6
00:01:49,521 --> 00:01:58,228
I want to know from which countries
you are coming from so I will ask

7
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:06,585
from the furthest part which is the
United States. How many people?

8
00:02:17,433 --> 00:02:52,988
And is anybody coming from South America? Europe,
Germany? England? Not in this course. Australia? Is

9
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:29,265
anybody who is coming from another country? Romania?
This is a Romanian course! Very good. From? Russia!

10
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:53,541
Who else is from Russia? Only one. All Russians are gone.
Last seminar we had the invasion of Greece by Israelis.

11
00:03:53,553 --> 00:04:11,008
They were the majority in the class. This time the
Romanians are coming. Very good. I see some changes.

12
00:04:11,232 --> 00:04:26,694
I could not recognize you. What happened to you? You
became a rabbi? Of high order? You didn’t do anything?

13
00:04:26,706 --> 00:04:41,464
It just grew. I agree with your beard. I don’t think
your wife will agree. Usually wives don’t like it.

14
00:04:43,497 --> 00:04:57,578
That’s why I don’t have a beard. I never had a
beard. What shall I say, it’s very difficult

15
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:12,449
because some people here are, for instance Steve
is attending the full course for the third time,

16
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:26,432
I don’t know why but anyhow, there are some people,
Romanian also that are very knowledgeable and there

17
00:05:26,444 --> 00:05:37,209
are some absolute newcomers. So I want to know who
the newcomers to Homeopathy are. Raise your hand.

18
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:58,869
I have to adapt my teaching. I have
to say a few things for the medical

19
00:05:58,881 --> 00:06:14,497
doctors who are coming for the first time.
I will just give you an example.

20
00:06:18,489 --> 00:06:29,695
A periarthritis, if it is on the left side,
the remedies that may cure such a condition

21
00:06:29,707 --> 00:06:39,906
are different from the ones indicated if
the periarthritis is on the right side.

22
00:06:42,578 --> 00:06:56,369
This already makes the individualization of the case,
makes Homeopathy a bit difficult. Because every time

23
00:06:56,381 --> 00:07:10,313
you will have to decide on the indicated remedy according
to the totality of the symptoms that a person has.

24
00:07:11,761 --> 00:07:26,153
When I say the totality I do not mean the
physical symptoms on the physical body, I

25
00:07:26,165 --> 00:07:40,569
also mean conditions and situations referring
to the mental or emotional side of us.

26
00:07:44,328 --> 00:07:56,207
In every case we have to take into consideration
whether together with the periarthritis there is

27
00:07:56,219 --> 00:08:07,624
an anxiety state, an irritable organism who is
very easily irritated and immediately explodes,

28
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:25,327
we have to take into consideration whether there are some digestive disorders,
we have to take into consideration whether this person has constipation

29
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:41,865
or diarrhea alternating, whether with this periarthritis there is also a
colitis,there is anger kept inside, whether there is grief kept inside.

30
00:08:43,585 --> 00:09:00,142
Because we understand that a human organism is a
living being who has be subjected along his life

31
00:09:00,154 --> 00:09:16,722
from the moment he was born to the point where he
comes to you as a patient, to a lot of stresses.

32
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:31,298
His organism was able to deal with these stresses
so far, either in good, positive way where

33
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:43,145
he got rid of the effect of the stress or if the
stress has left its marks upon this organism.

34
00:09:46,761 --> 00:09:56,552
For those that may know theoretically what a
stress is, Cellier, a Canadian doctor, I think

35
00:09:56,564 --> 00:10:06,473
was the first one who spoke about stress in
general and the effect of it upon the human body.

36
00:10:07,121 --> 00:10:22,256
So it is now accepted in Medicine that stress of
whatever kind especially if the stress is on mental or

37
00:10:22,268 --> 00:10:37,561
emotional level can create a situation in the body
where it starts compromising its possibility to react.

38
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:54,573
A stress within the organism, if it stays for a long
time, eventually will create a pathology which we

39
00:10:54,585 --> 00:11:08,497
may recognize as arthritis, colitis, ulcerative
colitis, autoimmune disease, neuromuscular disease etc.

40
00:11:09,785 --> 00:11:20,312
but there is always a time where the disturbance
starts and from there on the organism is

41
00:11:20,324 --> 00:11:31,098
compromised, his immune system is compromised.
It’s not going to deal well with this stress.

42
00:11:35,081 --> 00:11:44,748
The stress can be mental, emotional, you lost
your job, you lost your child, you lost your

43
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:54,545
beloved one and anyhow it is mostly connected
with some kind of loss of something you loved.

44
00:11:56,049 --> 00:12:12,315
And this stress will have an effect and the immediate
effect of the loss is… we cry. If we cry this

45
00:12:12,327 --> 00:12:27,953
is a defense of the organism that by crying we
allow the organism slowly to come back to normal.

46
00:12:28,569 --> 00:12:41,506
If we don’t cry, if we keep it inside, most probably there
is going to be a problem and the problem will manifest

47
00:12:41,518 --> 00:12:53,785
after a year or two or three etc. That’s why the homeopath
will take into consideration all these phenomena.

48
00:12:57,545 --> 00:13:08,535
Maybe I will shock you a little bit saying this;
the fact that we give to the children today a

49
00:13:08,547 --> 00:13:19,433
whole lot series of vaccinations which are
addressing themselves exactly to the immune system,

50
00:13:21,545 --> 00:13:28,223
the idea is preparing the immune system
so that it will be able to deal with

51
00:13:28,235 --> 00:13:34,577
the specific epidemic disease, that
is the theory behind the vaccination.

52
00:13:35,633 --> 00:13:48,487
We create antibodies and therefore the organism
will be able to deal with that, but if you give 10

53
00:13:48,499 --> 00:14:02,665
vaccinations together you create confusion in the immune
system which does not know anymore what to do first.

54
00:14:03,401 --> 00:14:15,251
As a result we have studies that showed
that after immunization we have severe

55
00:14:15,263 --> 00:14:28,177
conditions many times quite severe like autism
or we may have neuromuscular disorders.

56
00:14:32,968 --> 00:14:52,763
The French have done a research concerning the vaccination
for Hepatitis B in which it was found out that there were

57
00:14:52,775 --> 00:15:11,736
quite a lot of cases of Guillain–Barré syndrome which
creates a kind of paralysis which may or may not be cured.

58
00:15:27,617 --> 00:15:45,600
In view of this introduction which is quite theoretical
and some of you may agree or not I thought

59
00:15:45,612 --> 00:16:02,152
I will present to you a case of a child which
I had seen back in 1983 in the United States.

60
00:16:03,801 --> 00:16:09,990
I will give an introduction so you may
understand what happened with the child.

61
00:16:15,293 --> 00:16:34,950
I was teaching, I had a class like you in Berkley and
suddenly one of the students said I have a case of a child

62
00:16:34,962 --> 00:16:54,108
in the hospital who had chickenpox (varicella) and he’s
in the hospital diagnosed with varicella cerebellitis,

63
00:16:54,325 --> 00:17:08,517
it’s a complication of varicella that inflames the cerebellum
and there is a paralysis. And this little boy, 6 years

64
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:22,733
old, was in the hospital supported by saline intravenously
because he could not eat, swallow, neither water nor food,

65
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:35,437
he was exhausted, he was about for 15 days in that
condition, they asked me whether I would agree

66
00:17:35,449 --> 00:17:46,990
to take the child from the hospital and bring it
to me to see the child in front of the students.

67
00:17:47,301 --> 00:17:56,448
I agreed and see what I can do.
The child was brought and

68
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:05,461
I will just show you the
condition in which the child is.

69
00:18:06,269 --> 00:18:20,805
The time is 11 o’clock Friday morning and they brought
it straight from the hospital and the child because

70
00:18:20,817 --> 00:18:34,005
it was treated by some of my students had received
several remedies already, which had no effect.

71
00:18:34,837 --> 00:19:06,416
So the child is really in a bad condition and I will just
show you how he was when he came. The child has lost

72
00:19:06,428 --> 00:19:37,165
a lot of weight these 15 days. He sits quietly all the
time like this? – Yes. He’s been more animated today.

73
00:19:37,589 --> 00:19:54,401
– He likes company? He likes somebody next to him?
– …Although he will pull away. - He will pull

74
00:19:54,413 --> 00:20:10,716
away if somebody goes near? – Not all the time…
- How are you? – Good. - He can hardly speak.

75
00:20:12,165 --> 00:20:27,537
This is the situation and it is a case in which the
doctors that they have attended they have given me all

76
00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:42,789
the remedies they have given so far. The remedies that
were given were targeted towards general paralysis.

77
00:20:43,205 --> 00:20:59,665
So we have certain remedies that are active in paralysis.
These remedies had been given but with no effect.

78
00:20:59,677 --> 00:21:16,148
So when they bring the child the first thing I see is
that his inner state is one of exhaustion on one hand,

79
00:21:16,869 --> 00:21:28,904
and at the same time of sadness; there is a
deep sadness in this little boy which is

80
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:40,397
impressive for me. I said to myself
immediately how come that this boy is so sad?

81
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:57,749
When I asked the doctor who was attending she said it is because
he realizes he cannot walk and therefore he is sad. I didn’t buy

82
00:21:57,761 --> 00:22:14,341
that. Because a boy, it doesn’t matter whether he can walk or not,
his inner state can be joyful and still he may not walk at all.

83
00:22:15,317 --> 00:22:26,429
You realize the importance of the paralysis. So
I had to investigate what had happened to the

84
00:22:26,441 --> 00:22:37,565
boy and came to that state. Because the information
is he had varicella and then complication.

85
00:22:38,317 --> 00:22:52,589
Varicella went deeper, created and inflammation of the
cerebellum. The question that we always ask is how and

86
00:22:52,601 --> 00:23:06,885
why an organism can accept something which is usual as
an epidemic disease and can deal with that quite easily

87
00:23:07,061 --> 00:23:18,453
why he accepts to give up his defense and accept
to have such an inflammation on a much deeper

88
00:23:18,465 --> 00:23:29,029
level. So after that all my investigation is
to understand what has happened to the boy.

89
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:52,170
What I have found out is that the boy is
living with his mother because she had

90
00:23:52,182 --> 00:24:12,805
separated with the father and this is something
which is not realized by the mother,

91
00:24:13,181 --> 00:24:27,188
that maybe this separation has anything to do with the condition
of the child, she is not aware of that at all, so she

92
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:40,629
does not pay attention, so when I ask and I say to her did
the boy watch some discord between you and your husband

93
00:24:42,229 --> 00:24:59,110
she mumbled something I could not understand, I insisted to
understand what had happened in order to, finally, tell me after

94
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:16,285
much provocation that she and her husband are living in a state
in which I explain to Jacob and Jacob had understood the state.

95
00:25:16,605 --> 00:25:29,849
What is the state exactly? They were living in
another house. Jacob had left the house of the

96
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:43,541
father, she has a boyfriend and she has taken Jacob
to live in the same house with her boyfriend.

97
00:25:44,157 --> 00:25:57,007
Usually, in the U.S. there is no something peculiar.
What is peculiar is that here we have a child

98
00:25:57,019 --> 00:26:10,141
who is sensitive and who receives this information.
She says “I spoke to Jacob and he understands”.

99
00:26:13,549 --> 00:26:34,327
What he understands probably is not known to the mother.
Jacob understands some things which he does not say

100
00:26:34,339 --> 00:26:54,748
to the mother. I investigated the situation further and
I found out that this epidemic happened 15 days ago

101
00:26:55,229 --> 00:27:04,235
and the mother had to
go on a seminar like

102
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:13,685
you, I hope you didn’t
leave your little one,

103
00:27:14,029 --> 00:27:26,327
and she said to Jacob who was with varicella and
fever, “Jacob it’s ok, I am going for 3 days,

104
00:27:26,339 --> 00:27:38,389
don’t worry, everything is going to be alright…”
and she leaves the boy to go to the seminar.

105
00:27:44,509 --> 00:27:53,482
Then I investigate further and I
find out that the boy had been

106
00:27:53,494 --> 00:28:03,742
vaccinated a few months ago and there
was no reaction to the vaccination.

107
00:28:12,645 --> 00:28:21,657
The information which comes to me
and I evaluate is that this boy

108
00:28:21,669 --> 00:28:30,693
has been already in a state of grief
because of what has happened,

109
00:28:32,557 --> 00:28:53,387
when the mother left the house with the boy to live with
her boyfriend and it’s very interesting, you will not

110
00:28:53,399 --> 00:29:14,053
understand this point but I will tell you, asked “does
Jacob eat fruits?”. She said no he doesn’t like fruits.

111
00:29:21,229 --> 00:29:36,036
I said do you remember since when he stopped eating fruits? She said
from the moment we changed house, from we moment I took Jacob to

112
00:29:36,048 --> 00:29:50,645
that particular house where Jacob found himself instead of having
his mother and father he was having the mother with her boyfriend.

113
00:29:51,125 --> 00:30:06,105
From that moment Jacob stopped eating fruits. Now, what
is interesting for us is that if an organism stops

114
00:30:06,117 --> 00:30:20,548
eating fruits, it’s a signal that some changes have
taken place which are due, most probably, to grief.

115
00:30:21,581 --> 00:30:32,501
You may ask why grief should make an
organism not wanting fruits? We don’t know.

116
00:30:32,732 --> 00:30:44,557
We don’t know the physiology of that but it is a fact
that if you have been in grief yourself you may remember

117
00:30:44,569 --> 00:30:56,405
the same phenomenon but it is a very well-known phenomenon
that grief if it goes towards a particular direction

118
00:30:57,517 --> 00:31:11,152
which we call ‘silent grief’ that means a grief
during which you cannot express your emotions

119
00:31:11,164 --> 00:31:24,957
at all. You keep everything inside. If this happens
then the remedy which is needed is Ignatia.

120
00:31:34,709 --> 00:31:52,082
The remedy for me was Ignatia but then I had to confirm
it, the aversion to fruits is not enough to give Ignatia.

121
00:31:52,094 --> 00:32:08,717
Ignatia must have some other conditions, as well, one
of which is chorea, where the body moves automatically…

122
00:32:10,173 --> 00:32:25,069
if a person who has chorea needs Ignatia
then he is better lying down, as soon as he

123
00:32:25,081 --> 00:32:39,989
sits he starts moving. That is characteristic
of Ignatia as well. This was confirmed.

124
00:32:41,973 --> 00:32:52,320
Later on I asked the mother to lift the
child and make the child sit on her lap and

125
00:32:52,332 --> 00:33:03,061
after a while the child started feeling
uncomfortable. I asked what do you want, Jacob.

126
00:33:03,749 --> 00:33:13,155
He said I want to lie down because he was
feeling much better when he was lying

127
00:33:13,167 --> 00:33:21,997
down. The aggravation on sitting is
another symptom that confirmed Ignatia.

128
00:33:32,133 --> 00:33:43,784
So we had this boy that one and a half year
ago he entered a state of grief which we

129
00:33:43,796 --> 00:33:55,733
call silent grief because he was not able to
express grief to the mother or to anybody,

130
00:33:56,244 --> 00:34:04,212
this boy staying with the boyfriend without
telling anything to anybody, already

131
00:34:04,224 --> 00:34:11,612
his immune system started compromising,
started becoming weaker and weaker.

132
00:34:12,749 --> 00:34:27,641
An immune system which after grief cries with deep
cries, sighs it can release eventually itself. If

133
00:34:27,653 --> 00:34:42,557
this is kept inside, it shows an immune system that
is compromised already, cannot express the grief.

134
00:34:44,277 --> 00:34:58,589
That was going on for one and a half year, already. Then
comes the varicella and after a few days because the

135
00:34:58,601 --> 00:35:12,925
remedy was not found, the remedies given were outside of
the range of this disease, because of this condition,

136
00:35:14,836 --> 00:35:31,413
this boy’s immune system allowed the inflammation to
go to the cerebellum. Quite a serious condition. So it

137
00:35:31,425 --> 00:35:47,553
is Friday 11 o’clock as I said, the boy could not eat
or drink, so I go to the class, I analyze the case,

138
00:35:48,249 --> 00:35:59,069
I decide the remedy is Ignatia 1M, high potency
of Ignatia and then we have the evening session

139
00:35:59,081 --> 00:36:08,785
and by 8 o’clock in the night, I remember, I
asked the doctor who had brought the boy,

140
00:36:09,249 --> 00:36:24,612
I said please call the mother and ask her whether the boy
can now eat, swallow. She calls and she says that the boy

141
00:36:24,624 --> 00:36:39,866
is eating, drinking and asking for food all the time, from
11 o’clock in the morning till 8 o’clock in the evening.

142
00:36:42,865 --> 00:36:53,210
I said ok because if the boy continued not
eating and outside from saline he would

143
00:36:53,222 --> 00:37:03,704
be in tremendous danger, unless the remedy
has immediately acted, we could not wait,

144
00:37:01,732 --> 00:37:09,422
we would have to take him back to the hospital
because the boy had to be supported by intravenous

145
00:37:09,434 --> 00:37:16,428
saline otherwise he would be totally dehydrated,
not being able to eat or drink anything.

146
00:37:16,964 --> 00:37:34,476
Therefore I was very anxious what had happened,
if the remedy has acted. Fortunately the remedy

147
00:37:34,488 --> 00:37:51,464
was correct. It was a weekend, we did not have
a class and I wanted to see the boy on Monday.

148
00:37:51,978 --> 00:38:35,985
So you will see the boy on Monday morning and you
will see what happened. How is he? – You can see,

149
00:38:35,997 --> 00:39:21,337
yeah? –He is much better. – Shortly after we left
here, on Friday he felt better. – That’s interesting.

150
00:39:22,018 --> 00:39:30,812
Because she is a mother, she does not know Homeopathy,
just brought the child to Homeopathy, shortly after

151
00:39:30,824 --> 00:39:39,465
receiving the remedy the child felt better, so this
is something that you will experience a lot of times.

152
00:39:40,097 --> 00:39:56,793
Here is a case which is acute and in acute cases you will
experience this much more. Immediately after the remedy

153
00:39:56,805 --> 00:40:13,073
there is a sense of being better. In computers you make
a reset of it and the computer comes back into balance.

154
00:40:13,546 --> 00:40:22,810
This is the feeling that you will have and you
will be described by the patient in case you are

155
00:40:22,822 --> 00:40:31,809
giving the correct remedy. The child had received
6 wrong remedies before without any effect.

156
00:40:32,289 --> 00:40:40,857
This is the problem and that’s why I said in
the beginning it may be a little bit difficult

157
00:40:40,869 --> 00:40:48,609
this but once you investigate, once you
understood the global situation of the boy,

158
00:40:49,952 --> 00:40:57,065
where you did not have to take into consideration
only the fact that he was paralyzed

159
00:40:57,077 --> 00:41:04,120
and he could not swallow, but you take into
consideration his mental-emotional state,

160
00:41:04,513 --> 00:41:16,195
then you will be able to see the remedy
because Ignatia is a remedy that is

161
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:27,593
almost a specific for grief which is
kept inside. Secret. They cannot cry.

162
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:43,036
If you ask them they will say I cannot cry and what
happens, another characteristic is that they feel a

163
00:41:43,048 --> 00:41:59,328
constriction in the throat that cannot be overcome and it
is almost painful. It’s like a tightness in the throat.

164
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:16,384
You know you may have felt it, all of you, when you had some kind of
emotional trauma or you wanted to cry and you do not allow yourself to

165
00:42:16,396 --> 00:42:33,160
cry, then you feel a tightness around the thyroid and this tightness is
constriction after grief which is a characteristic of Ignatia, as well.

166
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:46,467
That’s why, when you have cases of
thyroid swelling, of whatever type,

167
00:42:46,479 --> 00:42:56,889
if it comes after grief one of the
remedy you may be using is Ignatia.

168
00:42:58,257 --> 00:43:13,316
Another is Natrum muriaticum which is a
complementary to Ignatia and you may need two or

169
00:43:13,328 --> 00:43:27,721
three remedies even, later on. It’s Monday
and the boy is still not walking properly.

170
00:43:28,817 --> 00:43:39,600
He is wambling a little bit still and he is
not steady. What else you can still notice

171
00:43:39,612 --> 00:43:49,786
is that is his eyes there is still the idea
of sadness. It’s not a happy boy, yet.

172
00:43:50,969 --> 00:44:10,950
If Ignatia acts it will act in such a way that will
bring back the joy to the child. On Monday we will see

173
00:44:10,962 --> 00:44:31,329
what he says. – When did his appetite return? – Next
day, pretty much. – And that was Saturday, right? – Yes.

174
00:44:33,361 --> 00:44:46,681
– And how it went? His appetite just returned
to normal? – More than normal. He wanted to

175
00:44:46,693 --> 00:44:59,729
eat constantly. On Saturday he ate all day…
- You see his eye. The grief is still there.

176
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:08,991
What is interesting is when I asked the doctor to call
the mother the same evening she said the child is asking

177
00:45:09,003 --> 00:45:17,440
constantly for food but I am afraid to give it because
the child had much time to eat and the mother was afraid

178
00:45:17,784 --> 00:45:28,565
that she will give all the food that the child
is asking maybe it will damage him,then she

179
00:45:28,577 --> 00:45:39,608
said, the next day, pretty much. But actually
the child was asking for food the same evening.

180
00:45:39,873 --> 00:45:48,750
The child was able to eat but she said
to the doctor I am careful not to give

181
00:45:48,762 --> 00:45:57,081
him as much food as he is asking. But
the child had a very good appetite.

182
00:45:58,025 --> 00:46:11,824
What is interesting I want you to observe the eyes
because the treatment here is not that the child gets

183
00:46:11,836 --> 00:46:26,042
over the possibility of having a damage more permanent.
The idea is that the child may get out of the grief.

184
00:46:27,856 --> 00:46:41,532
And that is the most important issue with Homeopathy, a
reset, the organism will come back to its normal state as

185
00:46:41,544 --> 00:46:54,992
long as the organism has the possibility but let’s see a
little bit more. -…And he was very pleased. Let me try!

186
00:46:55,552 --> 00:47:09,633
And then I told Vicky he was talking about pizza, spaghetti,
meatballs… -When did he get up and started walking? – On

187
00:47:09,645 --> 00:47:24,097
Saturday he wanted to move the wheelchair, we put him in the
wheelchair and then he started moving the wheelchair around.

188
00:47:24,721 --> 00:47:35,919
And he got a good sense of control with that. And then
shortly, I think that evening, he wanted to crawl out of the

189
00:47:35,931 --> 00:47:46,561
wheelchair to his bed, and then he would crawl into the
wheelchair himself. –It was Saturday evening, already.

190
00:47:54,648 --> 00:48:07,584
When did he stand on his legs? It was it on yesterday
or today? -Sunday. – And he walked a little bit or…? –

191
00:48:07,596 --> 00:48:20,544
He walked with help. Then he strained standing on his
own in the afternoon and just standing testing it out.

192
00:48:22,856 --> 00:48:40,068
This feels good, I can stand up! Is that right, Jacob?
– How do you feel, Jacob? – Good! – You are happy

193
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:56,648
now? Yes? Do you remember how you were before? How?
Can you describe? –Sad. – This is very important.

194
00:48:57,216 --> 00:49:11,976
Because the child can say now, I was sad. That means he
was really realizing how he was in comparison to what he

195
00:49:11,988 --> 00:49:26,760
is now. How you feel? Good! He is not good, yet. You will
see later on when he is really good how he will behave.

196
00:49:27,513 --> 00:49:49,826
Still there is that background of sadness. You
don’t know. Now you have a good appetite? Yes.

197
00:49:49,838 --> 00:50:11,688
What would you like to eat now? - Everything. –
What about ice cream? Yes. Sweets? –Sort of.

198
00:50:19,321 --> 00:50:23,128
- What about fruits? Do you like fruits?

199
00:50:24,745 --> 00:50:37,075
He likes fruits. – We have been giving him lots of protein
shakes, blended protein powder, fruit juice and yoghurt.

200
00:50:37,087 --> 00:50:48,577
– Has he been able to run at all? – Yeah. He ran across
the kitchen. He made a goal for himself to the wall,

201
00:50:48,832 --> 00:50:59,324
then he ran to the wall. Like a little person would
run if he was trained to. In fact his little friend

202
00:50:59,336 --> 00:51:10,042
Kellen who just turned 1 year old she, with her mother's
help, showed Jacob how she was learning to walk,

203
00:51:10,531 --> 00:51:16,476
so that’s how he started to walk.
Cause we noticed how

204
00:51:16,488 --> 00:51:22,228
she kept her balance. – You
understand what happened?

205
00:51:23,411 --> 00:51:37,258
An one-year-old girl came and taught him how to stand, she
showed how she was standing one year old and then he was

206
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:50,531
testing it the same he was able to stand up. It is very
interesting. – Jacob, do you remember seeing any dream?

207
00:51:53,018 --> 00:52:06,812
Yes? You saw a dream? Do you remember the dream? –It’s about
that tooth came out. –That’s a very interesting point. I

208
00:52:06,824 --> 00:52:20,629
don’t know why I asked him. I can’t remember now. It’s about
35 years ago. But he said about that tooth that came out.

209
00:52:20,972 --> 00:52:39,893
That means something of his own that he lost. For me the explanation
was the deeper acceptance of the boy losing his father. Losing

210
00:52:39,905 --> 00:52:59,556
something belonging to him, he has accepted in a subconscious level,
this fact which the mother was trying to persuade him long time ago.

211
00:53:00,988 --> 00:53:15,449
Jacob, it will be alright if we go there… He said ok. It was
not ok, he would not speak. Now, as the organism comes back,

212
00:53:15,461 --> 00:53:29,341
I don’t know by what mechanism, is on the subconscious level,
that he sees a dream that he lost something of his own.

213
00:53:30,397 --> 00:53:54,072
Part of him. I explain it as the acceptance of the loss
of his father. – And did he go out to play at all or he

214
00:53:54,084 --> 00:54:16,925
has stayed in the house so far? – He went out to stay
where his father lives in the country so I don’t know,

215
00:54:17,141 --> 00:54:30,748
did you go out and play? – Yes… - What did he say? –
Near the manor, there is this big huge estate house

216
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:43,989
and there is a very big eucalyptus tree, so he played
under the tree. – Do you like salty things? No.

217
00:54:44,837 --> 00:54:55,589
Sweets you like? Sort of, he said. But
what about meat? Fish? You like. Are you

218
00:54:55,601 --> 00:55:05,557
thirsty? You drink a lot? Not really.
– He doesn’t want to drink anything…

219
00:55:10,485 --> 00:55:19,921
- What I am trying to do here is find out
whether there are some indications for the next

220
00:55:19,933 --> 00:55:29,172
remedy because I am afraid that if there is a
relapse maybe the same remedy will not do,

221
00:55:29,604 --> 00:55:37,518
we may need to give a deeper remedy and I am trying to
find out through this questioning whether there are any

222
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:45,884
indication that the next remedy will be this or that. I am
investigating Phosphorus, Natrum muriaticum possibilities.

223
00:55:47,165 --> 00:56:05,299
I could not find any possibility and then I
asked to see the child 20 days later. So what

224
00:56:05,311 --> 00:56:22,853
you are going to see now is about 20 days
later. Here is the mother with the boyfriend.

225
00:56:24,724 --> 00:56:34,812
You will see how the child reacts in spite of the fact
that the boyfriend of the mother is present. The boy has

226
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:44,924
come back to normal which is the normal state of children,
when they are healthy, is to be happy no matter what.

227
00:56:46,181 --> 00:57:14,437
Even they have one hand less or one leg less
whatever the natural state of child is to be happy.

228
00:57:14,449 --> 00:57:40,677
So you will see how happy this child is in front
of the mother’s boyfriend. He is playing.

229
00:57:47,668 --> 00:58:34,472
He enjoys, he does not know he is being filmed.
Also you will see he looks to the boyfriend with

230
00:58:34,484 --> 00:59:19,853
no reaction. He provokes the mother to play with
him. I ask him the time and, see, he answers.

231
00:59:26,973 --> 00:59:36,793
I try to show whether mentally the child is ok,
emotionally you can see, it is obvious, the child has

232
00:59:36,805 --> 00:59:46,829
come back to the state of being happy again, but whether
mentally he has been affected, it’s not at all,

233
00:59:47,293 --> 01:00:29,374
but I will ask him some mathematics later on. – I have
some mathematical questions. What class are you now?

234
01:00:29,386 --> 01:01:09,141
First grade or second grade? First grade. Can you add
for me 4 plus 4? -4 plus for, it’s easy. It’s 8.

235
01:01:09,439 --> 01:01:34,548
100 plus 100, 200! – Can you add 1000 and 3000? – 4000.
– You are very good in mathematics! Are you happy now?

236
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:59,455
Ok. I wonder really, children with psychotherapy… how
long would it take to bring that state. This is 21 days.

237
01:02:01,286 --> 01:02:14,838
The child is in normal state. And this
kind of therapy, so effective, so

238
01:02:14,850 --> 01:02:27,671
precise, so natural, yet is fought
against, viciously for many years.

239
01:02:31,335 --> 01:02:45,925
You are aware that something is going on but this kind of
Homeopathy which is precise, because there is Homeopathy

240
01:02:45,937 --> 01:03:00,158
which is easy… Which Homeopathy is easy? For instance, you
have paralysis, which are the remedies for paralysis?

241
01:03:01,287 --> 01:03:11,944
It’s Causticum, Plumbum, Cocculus etc. You
take all of them, you give them and you

242
01:03:11,956 --> 01:03:22,111
have some effect. It just doesn’t work.
It will work for some cases, sometimes,

243
01:03:22,471 --> 01:03:28,338
but this kind of effect
where you have a real reset

244
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:34,343
of the organism will never
come with easy Homeopathy.

245
01:03:38,191 --> 01:03:50,441
You will be learning all this science and I
hope you will be successful in your prescribing

246
01:03:50,453 --> 01:04:02,582
by applying what you are learning but do not
expect to have immediately impressive results.

247
01:04:02,974 --> 01:04:13,843
Sometimes you will but not in all cases because most
of the cases today are difficult to treat because they

248
01:04:13,855 --> 01:04:25,038
have gone deeper into the human organism. What we call
autoimmune diseases, neuromuscular diseases, cancer etc.

249
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:45,385
All these deep chronic diseases need a long time of
treatment and very correct treatment in every stage.

250
01:04:45,397 --> 01:05:02,872
I would like you now for some minutes to ask questions
that you may already have by listening so far.

251
01:05:05,656 --> 01:05:23,160
Who is translating Romanian? Who can understand my
English? Who cannot understand my English? So why do

252
01:05:23,172 --> 01:05:40,687
you raise your hands since you cannot understand my
English? You understand a little bit! Only 3 people.

253
01:05:42,663 --> 01:05:59,265
Ask them, the Romanians that do not understand
my English. No Romanian is raising his hand.

254
01:05:59,277 --> 01:06:14,807
That means… 3! Only 3. Romanians are preparing
themselves entering the European Union.

255
01:06:16,271 --> 01:06:32,312
Wait and see what happens if you enter the E.U. More
or less, you are like Greece, most of the people know

256
01:06:32,324 --> 01:06:48,527
some English but… we will see. I would like to hear your
comments, your questions, whatever you like to ask.

257
01:06:49,198 --> 01:07:06,031
Don’t be shy. – My question is when you gave the
potency, 1M, was it because it was the mental

258
01:07:06,043 --> 01:07:22,887
level that had to be rectified first before
physical? – Yes. I realized that the whole problem…

259
01:07:23,375 --> 01:07:30,372
it was a problem that mental and
emotional level was involved.

260
01:07:30,384 --> 01:07:36,614
The mental and emotional side
of the child was involved.

261
01:07:37,167 --> 01:07:52,715
If you see the whole case you will see that child was
lying there for 1 hour or more, totally silent and if you

262
01:07:52,727 --> 01:08:07,871
look at his eyes you will see that they were looking
beyond, not to me or anybody, were looking the eternity.

263
01:08:09,071 --> 01:08:23,849
It was the look of a child in deep depression. Not
interested to talk, I provoked him, how do you

264
01:08:23,861 --> 01:08:38,047
feel, good, leave me alone. I said sit down. What
do you want? I want to lie down, that’s all.

265
01:08:38,486 --> 01:08:52,224
Lie down, don’t talk, like all the deep depressive cases that
they want to just lie down, close the windows, be in a dark

266
01:08:52,236 --> 01:09:05,423
place, stay by themselves, looking inside not being able to
face the world, because the immune system is compromised.

267
01:09:05,855 --> 01:09:20,047
Does not have energy, does not have power to react.
When somebody is reacting even violently he is much

268
01:09:20,059 --> 01:09:34,263
better for us because we see there is energy, this is
much better than somebody who cannot react at all.

269
01:09:40,576 --> 01:09:51,265
– Can you explain me why you did not give
Phosphoric acid to him? Is it because the child had

270
01:09:51,277 --> 01:10:02,320
difficulty of swallowing or…? – I’ll tell you the
difference between Ignatia and Phosphoric acid.

271
01:10:02,727 --> 01:10:15,529
Phosphoric acid is also a remedy that has deep
depression but the difference is that Phosphoric acid

272
01:10:15,541 --> 01:10:28,863
desires fruits. One of the main symptoms of Phosphoric
acid is that wants to eat fruits and juice fruits.

273
01:10:30,144 --> 01:10:45,240
So the child had aversion to fruits. So the mind cannot go to
Phosphoric acid anymore. I understand that there is a grief and

274
01:10:45,252 --> 01:11:00,960
Phosphoric acid is one of the remedies that you are thinking in
depression but the organism needs in order to survive fruit juices.

275
01:11:19,591 --> 01:11:31,278
– As I understood the child had a specific sensitivity
to this kind of stress, did Ignatia make him less

276
01:11:31,290 --> 01:11:42,655
sensitive to this kind of stress even though the
situation in the family remains the same? Is it true?

277
01:11:45,272 --> 01:11:51,868
– As long as I understood, she asks if
the constitutionally the child after

278
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:57,880
the remedy remained as sensitive as
before or less. – Less sensitive.

279
01:11:58,176 --> 01:12:08,127
The fact that the grief was so deep for the boy, the
boy felt I lose my father now, because they take the

280
01:12:08,139 --> 01:12:17,632
child put him on another house with a boyfriend,
what is this situation? It’s a shock for this child.

281
01:12:18,135 --> 01:12:31,398
The child goes into that state which is very
sensitive state. The remedy will bring back to his

282
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:44,823
normal, healthy, state. When he is under the grief,
it’s a very sensitive boy because the mother…

283
01:12:46,543 --> 01:12:59,995
I also forgot to tell you the mother told him that listen,
all these years, I had taken the decision to be with

284
01:13:00,007 --> 01:13:13,231
you and not go to work for 3 years. So she told him here
I am for almost 6 years and I have to go now to work.

285
01:13:14,383 --> 01:13:27,859
That was one thing she said to the boy. The other was while
he was having fever the mother said now I have to go to a

286
01:13:27,871 --> 01:13:41,017
seminar, this is ok. The boy said it is ok but it was in a
state of Ignatia, the organism was in a sensitive state.

287
01:13:41,567 --> 01:13:52,628
If now the mother says to him I will go to a seminar,
there is no problem. Unless it is a very big stress

288
01:13:52,640 --> 01:14:03,087
again to bring back a relapse the boy can withstand
any kind of reaction like a healthy human being.

289
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:13,175
I will also give you another information about the
boy, because I called about 18 or 20 years later, I

290
01:14:13,187 --> 01:14:22,920
spoke with the doctor who brought the boy, I asked how
is Jacob and she said I never gave another remedy.

291
01:14:29,191 --> 01:14:39,315
Jacob remained well. That means a good constitution,
if you want to know. We come to the conclusion that

292
01:14:39,327 --> 01:14:49,366
his constitution was good and that is why he presented
such a clear picture for me and for any homeopath

293
01:14:49,807 --> 01:14:57,647
because the stronger a constitution is the
clearer the indications for the remedy

294
01:14:57,659 --> 01:15:05,127
are. They give out clear signals. It’s
like saying give me Calcarea carbonica.

295
01:15:07,959 --> 01:15:20,614
The little ones they cry out, how do they say give
me Calcarea carbonica? Because the mother says

296
01:15:20,626 --> 01:15:32,647
he is asking me for soft-boiled eggs all the
time. Soft-boiled eggs contain a lot of calcium.

297
01:15:33,192 --> 01:15:46,277
So the organism says give me soft-boiled eggs and there
is another peculiarity; when calcium is disturbed

298
01:15:46,289 --> 01:15:59,880
there, usually, is a perspiration which is around the
neck, on the upper body. And there are cold extremities.

299
01:16:02,912 --> 01:16:13,519
The whole body becomes cold. All these are
signals that say I need Calcarea carbonica.

300
01:16:19,887 --> 01:16:29,842
– Regarding the pathology, do you think it
was really encephalitis or cerebellitis due

301
01:16:29,854 --> 01:16:39,248
to the virus or it was more a kind of
cataleptic state induced by repeated shocks?

302
01:16:43,023 --> 01:16:52,732
– It is known that varicella can create
an inflammation of the cerebellum.

303
01:16:52,744 --> 01:17:01,688
So I believe it was really a viral
infection which brought the state.

304
01:17:02,887 --> 01:17:16,323
Of course, if we want to examine it from a theoretical
point of view we know that i.e. Ignatia brings about a

305
01:17:16,335 --> 01:17:30,150
state of paralysis but it is usually hysterical. In this
case it is not hysterical because the boy is with fever,

306
01:17:30,582 --> 01:17:40,465
has varicella, is diagnosed and then he goes to
cerebellitis. The moment he stops being able to swallow and

307
01:17:40,477 --> 01:17:50,006
the extremities are paralyzed you know that the case
is going towards an inflammation of the cerebellum.

308
01:17:50,734 --> 01:18:03,032
So in this case really it was unusual that one would
think of Ignatia. What I was lucky to see it was that

309
01:18:03,044 --> 01:18:15,238
the boy was in a state of sadness. Deep sadness. I
immediately realized it by the way the boy was looking.

310
01:18:15,894 --> 01:18:22,056
It’s not natural for a
boy to look so sad. Not

311
01:18:22,068 --> 01:18:27,717
outside but in the inside.
I was impressed…
