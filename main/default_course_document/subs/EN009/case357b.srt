1
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:30,490
-Give us a resume of your case.

2
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:41,130
You came here in September 1999 for the first time with asthmatic bronchitis

3
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:42,710
and what else?

4
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:55,340
I prescribed Guaiacum and in case this does not work you should take Aconitum

5
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,680
and in case this does not work, Stramonium.

6
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,220
So tell us what you did.

7
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:08,520
-Guaiacum didn't show any effect, the cough was exactly the same, energy too.

8
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:12,610
I didn't take Aconite because there was no more panic attacks.

9
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,200
-I prescribed Guaiacum because of these panic attacks.

10
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:28,520
-There has been this accident before and after this accident, I had a lot of fears

11
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:34,100
and these panic attacks ceased, I didn't have them anymore and then I took Stramonium...

12
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,700
-And panic attacks came back?
-No.

13
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:50,180
The cough went away, I had fist slow aggravation and the energy slowly went better

14
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:57,610
and only then I realized how low it had been. It quickly increased the energy.

15
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:02,600
But emotionally for one week I was feeling very much worse,

16
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,600
this feeling of being deserted, left alone, loneliness was much worse.

17
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:11,430
-After Stramonium?

18
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:17,690
-Yes, then this got better but emotionally I didn't feel well.

19
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,860
I fell back to my love sickness.

20
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:37,680
-What she means by love sickness? She means love, nostalgia?

21
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:43,100
-I terminated a relationship in June 1999 and then there was this accident and afterwards

22
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,940
I fell back into my sadness, my love sickness concerning this man and then

23
00:02:50,040 --> 00:03:00,180
on Christmas I sent you fax listing my symptoms and you faxed back that I should take Ignatia 1M.

24
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,370
After taking Ignatia a lot of things happened.

25
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:10,020
I think I mentioned when I was first giving the history here, this feeling of guilt,

26
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:16,730
I feel as if I have done something wrong and feel guilty but I wouldn't know what it was.

27
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,690
Then it got clear to me and I could remember a sexual abuse in my childhood.

28
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,810
-After Ignatia?
-Yes.

29
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:29,760
And I think it was something that this man told me then that I had done

30
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:35,700
something really evil and nobody should know about this.

31
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:42,600
I think then as a child I was very lonely because I could go nowhere with this

32
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:49,350
and I closed it up within myself and that only got clear to me now

33
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:55,200
that I thought when this kept on my shoulders, I can't really become happy.

34
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:01,100
I think this has something to do with my spells of desperation,

35
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,410
all of my life I had periods and spells of real desperation

36
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:12,200
and I never knew where it was coming from and I think that was related to this experience too.

37
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:18,610
There was always a feeling that I'm not allowed to be happy, that this is not for me

38
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:28,360
and since now I didn't understand what this is all about, the desperation is not as deep

39
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:33,800
as it has been and it got clear to me that it is not my guilt

40
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:39,230
but that I have been carrying the guilt of another person. So that happened.

41
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:45,900
-No asthma now?
-No but still it left a sort of a nervous cough.

42
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,390
-From time to time, in certain hours or in the night?

43
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:57,230
-Every now and then and it always happens when I remember these things.

44
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,730
But it's only for short time, it wouldn't last.

45
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,630
-There is no breaking out in the skin?

46
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:16,630
-After Ignatia it was rush coming out around my breast, red spots and it was itching

47
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:21,050
but it wouldn't last for long, it came several times and it was going very quickly.

48
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,980
-What about the leucorrhea?

49
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:36,470
-This gradually got better but now after the last menstruation I had leucorrhea again

50
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:41,600
for 3 days which was quite strong but then it went away.

51
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:49,960
-By September last year she said she had no menses. That means menses started again.

52
00:05:50,060 --> 00:06:01,350
-I was still in Alonissos when I was having a relation and 14 days later the menstruation started.

53
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,440
-How long she did not have menstruation?
-From August to October.

54
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:20,060
-And the shock took place in June-July?
-The accident was in August.

55
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,520
And afterwards the menses stopped.

56
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:31,440
-But first was the separation in June-July?

57
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:39,680
-The menstruation ceased in August after the accident.

58
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:47,600
-How is the fear of the dark? She had so strong fear of the dark.

59
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,950
-It is still there but it's not so strong as it used to be.

60
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:55,020
-The fear of accidents?
-That is still there.

61
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:00,690
-Quite strong? Because here we had put it on 4th degree.

62
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:04,020
-Not as strong as it was, it is in latent state.

63
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,670
-The fear of death?

64
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:11,180
-Still there in latent phase but not as pronounced as it used to be.

65
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:19,840
-She complained also of a weakness on the heart area, you remember?

66
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:26,590
-That is still there and I often have a stumbling, this is a very forceful beat of my heart

67
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:35,090
and palpitations. This is quite frequent.

68
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:46,750
-There was a sensation of tiredness in the eyes.
-That is better.

69
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:55,850
-Also if she remembers, she has said that the air outside aggravates her.

70
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:04,770
It was the asthma or it was a general aggravation, whether she is still aggravated by open air.

71
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:09,670
-The aggravation, as far as I remember was due to cold air.

72
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:13,430
-Cold air then the cough aggravated, that was one.

73
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:20,420
But then I have here on the notes that a general aggravation from open air, as well.

74
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,340
-That is there no more.

75
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,090
-She drunk any milk?

76
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:39,100
-I have a strong aversion for milk, for the time being.

77
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:47,510
-Still it's there. What about the restlessness in bed, she was very restless.

78
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:52,010
-That is still there and I have a hard time falling asleep and when I'm sleepless

79
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:55,270
I'm very restless and turning around.

80
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:05,840
-How much salt she takes?
-Completely normal.

81
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:12,340
-The desire for sweets is still there?
-That is as strong as it has been.

82
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,990
-What about ice cream?
-Not that much.

83
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:23,680
-Fruit?
-I like it.

84
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:35,510
Abdominal pains and I think is due to my anger.

85
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:39,260
Psychologically I'm in a state where I feel a lot of anger.

86
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:44,660
-She feels the anger? She expresses the anger?

87
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,930
-No, I can't do this.

88
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:52,760
I feel the anger is there but I'm not able to express and then the abdominal pain starts.

89
00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:03,180
I think this is related to this man too who was sexually abusing me and I fantasy of violence.

90
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:08,410
-Killing him?
-To hit him and to stab him with a knife.

91
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:11,660
-She knows the man?
-He was a neighbor.

92
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,990
-So she knows.
-I wouldn't know now where he lives now.

93
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:27,400
-So there is anger towards him specifically or anger towards her boyfriend for instance.

94
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:37,310
-Yes, this is generally. The thing is that this happened over and over again in my life,

95
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:41,970
like this man was using me sexually.

96
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:46,570
-Who, the original man?

97
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:58,820
-In my childhood, this man was using me sexually and my soul didn't matter to him.

98
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:07,980
He didn't mind and that happened to me over and over again that men wanted to sleep with me

99
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:15,320
but my soul just didn't matter anything to them. And that makes me really angry.

100
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:33,330
-How she feels towards the last man, after Ignatia she forgot him or he is still there.

101
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,270
-I haven't forgotten him.

102
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,610
-She has another affair at the moment?

103
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,200
-I'm fleeing at the moment when a man is approaching me.

104
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,220
-She doesn't trust.

105
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:07,770
-Another physical complaint, here around my eye, there is growing a tight thing.

106
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,770
A sort of a wart.

107
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:25,830
-Anything else? How is her sleep in the night, is it constant?

108
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,340
-That differs a lot.

109
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,580
It may happen that I sleep well but it may also happen that I don't sleep very well.

110
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,620
I'm easily excited.

111
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,420
If something happens, I'm easily excited and if I'm excited I can't really sleep well.

112
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:44,920
-During day in the noon time, does she take a nap?

113
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:50,420
-Every now and then but very rarely and mostly I can't fall asleep.

114
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,180
I have difficulties in falling asleep.

115
00:12:54,930 --> 00:13:02,340
-If she does fall asleep, that sleep makes her feel good, she wakes up well?

116
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:17,190
-It does well. But it's rare that I fall asleep.

117
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:22,760
-I had headaches and that was coming up more frequently that two times

118
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:27,360
I had headaches by the sun and that was completely new

119
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:31,190
but maybe I was staying in the sun for too long.

120
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,590
-Generally she feels very warm, very cold?

121
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:40,660
-In the winter very cold but now it's summer so it's OK but I'm rather on the cold side.

122
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:45,090
-How is her sexual desire?

123
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:50,170
-This is normally very high but I'm not able to sleep and have sex with a man

124
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:56,670
and I don't have feelings for him and I won't just be able to sleep with him

125
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:01,850
if I don't feel for him. But there are lots of erotic thoughts.

126
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:44,820
I don't remember if I had analyzed this case last time. Who has notes? Why I gave Guaiacum...

127
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,800
Did I tell you? You have your notes?

128
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:55,550
-In my notes I read that you prescribed Guaiacum because of the shock she had, the fright.

129
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,390
-This is what I wanted to say, whether I had mentioned this

130
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:07,810
because I want to again comment on the Guaiacum.

131
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:20,130
Guaiacum is a remedy which has after effects of fright and you may have asthma,

132
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:25,210
you may have rheumatoid arthritis, you may have headaches

133
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:32,800
and because it lives within the sub-conscious mind a kind of a state

134
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:42,680
which is a state similar to Aconite or Stramonium but I prefer to start with Guaiacum.

135
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:50,000
In this case most probably I had some other reasons,

136
00:15:50,100 --> 00:16:01,600
I don't remember and Guaiacum took away, she said, the panic attacks.

137
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:29,580
Guaiacum took away the panic attack but did not affect the cough,

138
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,190
which means that Guaiacum acted partially.

139
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:47,840
And normally because it did not act curatively, it should have aggravated even perhaps

140
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:53,690
the other conditions, like the asthma or whatever.

141
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:06,260
Stramonium was the correct remedy and then what happened.

142
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:14,100
The organism started dealing more with the grief.

143
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:23,000
There is the separation, there is the accident, there is this big fright that comes

144
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:32,580
after the accident, that stops the menses, brings out this condition and the fear

145
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:40,250
and all that which is taken away by Stramonium and then the organism wants

146
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:53,340
to deal with the grief of the separation from the boyfriend and she starts having these problems

147
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,430
and she writes the fax.

148
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:16,580
In the fax most probably she wrote some symptoms of Ignatia,

149
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,930
that's why I prescribed Ignatia.

150
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:34,430
And I was ready to say, wait. Then she mentioned the anger

151
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:41,430
and the repercussion of the anger in the abdomen.

152
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:51,330
Which symptoms you have used? You have used nervous cough.

153
00:18:51,430 --> 00:19:00,120
On this I have to comment, nervous cough is a very characteristic symptom of Ignatia.

154
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:06,270
Nervous cough is a hysterical kind of a cough which they cough, cough, cough,

155
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:13,120
they can not even breathe and then it goes away and then comes next day, after 2-3 days.

156
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:22,680
Hysterical kind of coughing, repeated coughing which goes away as sudden

157
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:30,200
as it has come and it comes because of grief usually.

158
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:36,850
In such cases the causative factor of this cough is grief. Now she says, she never coughs.

159
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:46,430
Then ailments of emotional excitement, fear of accidents not so much, fear of dark not so much,

160
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:53,770
weakness heart, about the heart palpitation, aversion milk, tossing about in in bed  restlessness,

161
00:19:53,870 --> 00:20:04,550
chocolate desire, fruit desire, suppressed ailments from anger, violent, disappointed love,

162
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:08,890
suspicious, sexual desire increased.

163
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:16,540
Sexual thoughts, maybe you can take away sexual desire increased,

164
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,890
I'm not sure that this is correct.

165
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:34,870
Show me now what is the Expert System says? Staphysagria and second Ignatia.

166
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:46,370
Staphysagria shot up. Why Staphysagria? Show me why, explain why?

167
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:54,210
Because she has 9 symptoms, palpitation of the heart, milk aversion, tossing about,

168
00:20:54,310 --> 00:21:01,280
chocolate, fruit, anger suppressed, love disappointed, suspicious etc.

169
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:05,960
And we have to think about Staphysagria because everybody most probably was thinking

170
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:17,290
of Staphysagria, yes or no? That is the question. Here the repertorisation says yes.

171
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:26,290
-You can add...  which is growing. I think it is in Staphysagria, it's not added,

172
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,800
it's very strong point.

173
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:36,140
-Where can I find it in the Repertory? Did you find it?

174
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:41,310
-Yes. Growth in the face of what?

175
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:48,050
-Tumor.
-Tumor is very strong.

176
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:11,140
Now what I think is, let me give you the analysis, my evaluation of the case.

177
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:34,730
We have given remedies like Stramonium and Ignatia to deal with her shocks

178
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:46,370
and the organism is dealing with this quite all right but still she says, my anger is there.

179
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:56,730
Now what we have to do is to say, shall we help this organism to take away anger?

180
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:09,380
To counteract the anger by giving a dose of Staphysagria or should we still wait

181
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,890
to see this organism how will develop. Why?

182
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:24,550
Because if we give Staphysagria and Staphysagria is not correct, is going to interfere

183
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:26,010
because it's very close.

184
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:30,270
It's going to interfere with the case. Now the case is doing quite well,

185
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:33,010
in spite of this anger being there.

186
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:41,090
I want to see if this organism lead by itself with the remedy she had already, whether

187
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:46,110
she will deal with this anger in a more conscious way.

188
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:53,500
She does not like the idea, she wants to take Staphysagria

189
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:59,770
but why I said that is I tell you a little detail which I don't like.

190
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:07,780
A typical Staphysagria, if she sleeps in the afternoon wakes up in a terrible state.

191
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:18,760
If she would have told me, I wake up in a terrible state, I would say OK

192
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:23,840
but she was not able to confirm that important keynote of Staphysagria.

193
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:32,780
Therefore I will wait either to see that this keynote will come, where I will have the seal,

194
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:44,110
yes Staphysagria is there, or what I will see is that the organism by itself will sort out the anger.

195
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:55,030
The fact also, she has sexual thoughts is in favor of Staphysagria also.

196
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:04,010
Staphysagria does not like, as I have said in the Materia Medica,

197
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:12,450
does not like to have sex, they like to have first contact and then sex.

198
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:20,610
And I have said that is why Staphysagria many times will resort to masturbation.

199
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:24,600
They prefer to have that instead of having...

200
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:32,110
They can not have sex without the emotional attachment, without the emotional synchronicity.

201
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:44,860
They are too sensitive, they feel vulnerable so they will not go to bed

202
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,020
without having this emotional connection.

203
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:56,760
And what she is saying, she is actually saying that and yet I would like to have further confirmation,

204
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,440
before I give it.

205
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:11,090
Because she is doing well and I don't want to improve matters too fast to spoil the case

206
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:15,090
and then when she comes back here, she comes back in a confused state

207
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:17,030
and we don't know what to do.

208
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:26,110
Therefore you have only 10 minutes of interval and we go for the next case.

209
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,950
You would like to say something?

210
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:35,150
-What would you do, if the symptom you are waiting for, does not appear and the state remains,

211
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:38,920
as it is, unchanged, what would you do then?

212
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:43,530
-Let's say it remains for 6 months, I will give it. I will give it.

213
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:52,430
-This decision is confusing me a bit because we always learn with every keynote

214
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:57,930
or every symptom can be there but it's not a must that the patient has to have all the keynotes

215
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:00,280
before you can give the remedy.

216
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:08,420
-I explain. This case is doing well. This is different than if she was saying,

217
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:13,670
I'm suffering I have this, I have that. Then I would have given it.

218
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:24,280
But at this moment I say, wait to see whether the organism by itself will clear up this internal anger.

219
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:29,180
Because she is aware now. She says, I know what has happened to me,

220
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:35,530
so that means the logical mind is in control of the situation.

221
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:43,930
The organism may find a way to readjust itself and settle down the anger

222
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:47,600
because it's not urgent that I should give this.

223
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:55,450
So I have now time to wait and see what happens until I have more confirmation.
