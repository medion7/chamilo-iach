1
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:31,850
-It' another case we have to see. What is your main problem?

2
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:46,500
-Now I can say that is the fact that I can not make normal relationship with a man

3
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:59,600
because I'm afraid and I don't feel anything. It's like an object for me.

4
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:05,080
-A man is like an object? It doesn't bring out some emotions?

5
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:05,670
-No.

6
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,600
-No emotions at all.

7
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:13,520
-Even if he touches me or he kisses me, no feeling.

8
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:22,120
-But would you say it's almost an aversion or it is neutral?

9
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:31,120
-It's neutral, I want to be kind, to open to him but I can't.

10
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:39,390
-You can not. When this happened?
-This happened about 4 years ago.

11
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:44,040
-So what happened 4 years ago?

12
00:01:45,090 --> 00:02:00,960
-I fall in love with someone at the first sight and totally and we were together

13
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:07,560
about 1 year and we talked about marriage and the future.

14
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:21,310
He showed me very much affection he was very kind with me and one day before Christmas

15
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:32,890
in the evening he was OK he came to my parents, talked to them.

16
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,560
-To arrange the marriage?

17
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:49,040
-For the engagement and the next day when we usually meet, he said we must separate

18
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:59,340
because I do not love you so much as I wanted to and I want to finish.

19
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:06,960
-How much older was this man?
-About 38-40.

20
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:14,810
-You were 20?
-I was 32 and he was 38.

21
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:27,640
-And he was married before?
-No and he is not now.

22
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:35,740
-So he felt great responsibility from one day to the other and

23
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,310
he flew away from the responsibility.

24
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:49,710
So we would give him Lycopodium if we had him now but we don't have him,

25
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:50,810
he made the damage.

26
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,810
After that how you felt, can you described to me?

27
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:06,450
-That night I wished to be dead and at home I couldn't say anything

28
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:15,160
because my mother was in treatment at him, he was stomatological doctor

29
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:25,460
and if I would say something maybe my mother would not finish and I went home

30
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:33,810
very happy and I didn't say anything for 3 weeks.

31
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:40,950
-You don't speak to anybody, you just cry or you didn't cry?

32
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:44,460
-Yes I cried a lot.
-But you cried by yourself.

33
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:52,060
-Yes on the way to the office and coming back and in the night.

34
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,970
-When nobody could see you. That was the idea.

35
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:10,450
-Yes. Actually at that time I don't know how I lived because for me

36
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:19,370
I was walking to the office because I couldn't take a bus and I just couldn't see

37
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,730
people or cars.

38
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:29,170
It doesn't matter, I cross the street and I didn't know if a car comes or not.

39
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,140
It was like in a dream.

40
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,040
-And when you were back home?
-I was happy.

41
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:47,540
-You ate whatever and then you went to your room and you locked your room?

42
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:53,370
-No because if I lock my room, my mother would come and say what happened.

43
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:56,370
No, no. I expect the night.

44
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:00,620
-And you could sleep or you had to think, think, think?

45
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,970
-No, I just think, think, think and I had insomnia for 3-4 months.

46
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:14,860
-You could not sleep. And all these nights you were crying and you were suffering?

47
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,350
-Only 3 weeks and every night I said tomorrow I will not be weak anymore,

48
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:26,780
tomorrow I will stop, he does not deserve it.

49
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:37,870
And I said to myself that never in my life I will be in love with someone.

50
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,800
-It was a deep hurt.

51
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:55,700
-Yes, in the office if a man opened the door, I just cry.

52
00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:00,480
It starts without wanting.

53
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:12,950
And I couldn't be touched for about 4 months by anybody, woman or man.

54
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:25,690
-And now you can be touched by someone?
-Yes but I don't feel anything.

55
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:30,460
-Yes but if another woman touches you it doesn't matter.

56
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,390
-Yes it's OK, it doesn't matter.

57
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:38,970
-But if a man touches you also, it's indifferent.
-Yes.

58
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:49,720
-Do you have a desire to have a relationship?
-Yes.

59
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,620
-Sexually do you have some phantasies?
-No, no.

60
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,470
-Not at all. Now you can sleep?

61
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:12,080
-It's a problem because a year and a half ago I started a treatment to a homeopath.

62
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,580
-What remedies you took?

63
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:41,540
-A lot. Anacardium, Agaricus, Ignatia, Sulphur, Berberis, Lac can., a lot. Maybe 30.

64
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:57,040
When I go for the first time to the homeopath, I think it was the shortest visit.

65
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:03,240
In two words I said everything it was a problem with my eyes and that's all.

66
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:11,390
No fears, no problems, no grief, anything and he probably didn't know what to give me

67
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:19,940
and I don't know, I can't remember what he gave me but after that

68
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:31,790
I had 5 months of insomnia and I took all kind of remedies for this insomnia.

69
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,190
-But you did not know the first remedy what it was?

70
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:44,290
-No, I can't remember. I think it was China but I'm not sure.

71
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:55,040
-You never had Nat. mur.?
-I think I had once 30, one dose of 30.

72
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:02,040
-Sepia?
-Sepia no.

73
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:13,660
-Tell me do you like salt?
-No, normal.

74
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,660
-Sweets?
-Yes a lot.

75
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:31,660
-Your menses had been affected at all?
-Yes they became irregular and they stopped.

76
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:39,560
-Instead of menses do you have leucorrhea, some discharge?

77
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:44,820
-Yes and it appears migraine, headaches.

78
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,820
-Which are mostly where?

79
00:10:51,830 --> 00:11:05,570
-They begin to occipital and then they come forward over the eyes and

80
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:14,310
it's about 2-3 days I have a headache. I wake up in the morning with a headache.

81
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,960
-And they last how long?

82
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:24,810
-2-3 days. And in this period all other symptoms and pains are gone.

83
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,310
-For instance what other pains?
-Pains from the back.

84
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:39,710
-So you are suffering with back pains as well which come when?

85
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:49,210
-They are permanent. After the homeopathic treatment they became permanent.

86
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:53,590
Before they were only in winter.

87
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:11,420
-Mostly right or left, can you say where the headaches are mostly?

88
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:27,770
-No, it's the whole head. And it becomes like an explosion, I feel like the head will explode.

89
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:35,520
-That means you had China most probably. China has these headaches.

90
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:50,440
-(?)

91
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,770
-Sometimes yes, not always.

92
00:12:56,270 --> 00:13:01,010
-Now for how long your menses have stopped? For 1 year, 2 years?

93
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,860
-No, for 1 month.

94
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:12,520
-And the discharge leucorrhea since when is appearing?

95
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:17,860
-It is almost permanent.

96
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:27,020
-It is quite a lot, what color?
-It is a lot and it is yellow.

97
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:52,670
-It's good you did not take the Nat. mur.
-She took.

98
00:13:52,770 --> 00:14:07,420
-It doesn't matter. Can you tell me if you like to sleep in a certain position?

99
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:20,120
-On the left side. Because I have pains if I sleep on back or in any other position.

100
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,520
Only on the left.

101
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:37,620
-Before that incident your emotions were strong? You had strong emotions?

102
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,220
-Yes and no.

103
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:45,470
-Your emotions were equal?

104
00:14:50,470 --> 00:15:03,520
-I would say I could have real relationship with a man.

105
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:10,490
-During that year when you had the relationship, did you have sexual intercourse?

106
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,340
-No because he didn't want.

107
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:26,670
-But you wanted? You had the desire?
-Yes. It was the only time that I had desire.

108
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:31,170
-Before that you did not have and after that also you did not have.

109
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,950
-I see.

110
00:15:53,920 --> 00:16:01,820
-Do you have any peculiar symptoms in your back pains?

111
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,170
Would you say I have that peculiar symptom?

112
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:15,370
-I have a pain like blow which is permanent on the lower back.

113
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:24,120
-But is it better by lying down, worse by lying down, something very clear?

114
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:27,840
-No, it is permanent.

115
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:33,840
-Do you have any fears?
-A lot.

116
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:44,840
-What is your biggest fear?
-Now it's death.

117
00:16:46,340 --> 00:17:00,340
-Fear of death. Next to this?
-To be lonely, to remain alone.

118
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:12,240
-And the fear of death comes together with some fear of cancer, fear of heart disease

119
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:15,590
or you will die soon, anything of that type?

120
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:42,340
-No, I just think that death scares me very much. I was many times in front of death.

121
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:53,090
-In the hospital?
-No, myself. Several times I was almost drowned.

122
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,740
-By accident?

123
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:08,370
-Yes, I don't know how to swim and I go further than I could and somebody took me out.

124
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:22,430
Then I was near to an accident car when I was driving and since then I can't drive.

125
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:31,170
I was too scared. And earthquakes.

126
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,170
-You fear earthquakes?
-Yes.

127
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:46,920
-Any other fear?
-Of robbers.

128
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,570
-Is it strong?

129
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:08,240
-Really strong because several times they tried to break into my house

130
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,840
and to cut my bed and so on.

131
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:22,240
-Just put it once. You have thirst? What do you need?

132
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:31,740
-I need cold water also in winter I drink cold water.

133
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,990
-Ice cold?

134
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:38,340
-In summer ice cold but in winter cold by the refrigerator.

135
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:46,740
-And you have aversion to milk? Or you can take some?

136
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,520
-Yes, I can drink but I don't like it much.

137
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:14,650
And it is something from my past. When I was 16 I suddenly became ill, nobody knows

138
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:27,400
what it is, it was after an operation of appendix and after 3 months where nobody could

139
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:37,720
tell me what it is, some doctor prescribed me tuberculostatic drugs.

140
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,720
-For tuberculosis?
-Yes.

141
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:03,220
-Did you check yourself to see what it was?
-Yes but it was negative.

142
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:17,390
-And still he gave you the antitubercular drug?
-Yes they said that perhaps it was in genital.

143
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:42,540
-When you sneeze or you cough do you have loss of urine?

144
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,180
-Sometimes.

145
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:03,930
And maybe it is important to say that in my family it was a lot of cancer.

146
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,830
-Your parents died from cancer?

147
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:23,840
-My grand parents, 3 of them died from cancer and my mother had cancer.

148
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:26,880
She was operated.

149
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,960
-Would you say are you very timid?
-Yes.

150
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:37,010
-And also you have low self confidence?
-Yes.

151
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:40,260
-Very much?
-Yes, very.

152
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:50,890
-But I see here in your hobbies you like dancing. Is this something that

153
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:53,150
you enjoy very much?

154
00:22:53,250 --> 00:23:05,490
-Yes I love music and it gives me some quietness and peace.

155
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,740
-Loud music?
-Very loud.

156
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:22,570
-Loud and rhythmic?
-Not rhythmic, meditation music.

157
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:30,720
-Here dancing is underlined 3 times. It's really so strong?

158
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,820
-Yes.

159
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:43,070
-And you feel better in the afternoon?
-Yes I can work better in the afternoon, evening.

160
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:53,320
-Do you feel very much in a hurry inside you?
-Yes. I'm in a great hurry.

161
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:58,560
-But you sit there very quiet, you don't look in a hurry at all.

162
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:05,410
-Yes but I want to do everything very quickly.

163
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:13,410
-And do you want to do 3 jobs at the same time?
-Yes, if it is possible.

164
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:19,440
-And do you want others to do things quickly?
-Yes.

165
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:23,240
-If they are slow, then you become angry?
-Yes, yes.

166
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:47,180
-Do you have aggression inside? Do you keep inside you, you feel you have kept

167
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:57,030
aggression, you are angry? You are a person who would fight easily?

168
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:01,940
-Yes, for anybody else yes, for me no.

169
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:07,840
-But you would fight for your friends or mother, father?

170
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:13,340
-Yes, it doesn't matter, who wants to be helped.

171
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,100
-When I say fight, I mean real fight, you go and kick them.

172
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,200
-No, no physically.

173
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:29,220
-But you would use bad words, you attack somebody by words or you just go

174
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,810
and help somebody only?

175
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:33,530
-To help.

176
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:41,280
-Not to fight, real fight?
-No.

177
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:50,930
-What would you answer to my question whether you feel aggression inside?

178
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:52,290
What is your answer to that?

179
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:09,930
-I don't know. Sometimes this is very rare, once the year perhaps, I become very angry

180
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:24,180
and I do not want anybody near me or if I'm at work, everybody must do the right thing

181
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:31,280
because if they don't, I'm very, very angry and I use bad words.

182
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,420
-By that time?

183
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:50,020
-Yes, it's like I try to get out from me to relieve but it's once the year.

184
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:55,920
-In your bed when you are sleeping, you are very restless or you stay in one position?

185
00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:00,920
-No, I'm restless because I have pains.

186
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:07,670
-Otherwise you won't be restless according to you or you don't know?

187
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:10,800
-I don't know.

188
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:25,370
-What I ask you, everybody around you must hurry is very strong for you?

189
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:33,380
-Yes, I have a problem with time because I want to do everything very fast.

190
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:39,080
-Even if you have enough time, if you have 1 hour, you want to do it in 5 minutes?

191
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,500
-Yes.

192
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,670
-Is that what you say?
-Yes.

193
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:51,420
-And you want the others to do their job fast? If you see them doing it slowly...

194
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,020
-I get angry.

195
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:32,980
-And you say you have clairvoyant dreams?
-Yes.

196
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:36,970
-Are you clairvoyant?
-I don't know.

197
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:05,130
-The leucorrhea which you have, it is since 11 years old when the menses started.

198
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:08,370
It started again with leucorrhea almost immediately?

199
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,720
-Yes.

200
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:16,130
-During the time when you felt the desire for sex do you remember you still had the

201
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:21,120
leucorrhea or during that time the leucorrhea was reduced?

202
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,730
-I can't remember.

203
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:27,980
-It was more, it was less?
-No.

204
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:32,970
-In general you feel cold, warm?
-Cold.

205
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,120
-And you suffer from cold?

206
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:47,640
-Yes but not much. Before the remedies I was very cold.

207
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:58,120
-But after so many remedies at least this is cured. What about your nails? Are strong?

208
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,160
-No.

209
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:04,660
-They break easily?
-No.

210
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,060
-They are soft?
-Soft yes.

211
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:34,970
And when I have an acute disease, I do not make fever of perspiration.

212
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,210
-You never have fever?
-No.

213
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,860
-When you have an acute disease, you don't have fever.

214
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,160
-No.

215
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:49,250
-You have taken Arsenicum in the past?
-Yes.

216
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,960
-I took only low potencies.

217
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:09,460
-You have a lot of warts?
-Yes they appear on the head, in the hands.

218
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:15,860
-Can you show me these warts? What do you mean wart?

219
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:22,670
These black spots you call warts? These are not warts.

220
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:36,010
-No, this appeared last time about half a year. These black nodes.

221
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,770
-No, it's not a wart.

222
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:59,050
How are your feelings towards your parents?

223
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:02,540
-They have a lot of affection to me.

224
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:08,000
-They have not changed this affection after this incident?

225
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,270
-No.

226
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:17,340
-It became more?
-I can say yes.

227
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:42,680
-This hurried feeling do you remember how long you have it?

228
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:48,830
-It is...

229
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:53,240
-It is with you all the time as much long as you remember?

230
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:57,000
Even as a child you were so much in a hurry?
-Yes, yes.

231
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:04,990
-Do you do physical exercises?
-No because I have pains.

232
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:13,240
-But before the pains, as a young woman, 13,14,15?

233
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,630
-No.

234
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,250
-Did you like running?
-No.

235
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:26,340
-Not physical exercise. Do you like to read?
-To read or to make something else but not that.

236
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:34,990
-Do you like to walk?
-Walk only if I'm upset.

237
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:45,010
-Then you go to walk fast or slowly?
-Fast.

238
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:56,510
-And then slowly you calm down?
-No I calm down also fast.

239
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:11,800
-Walking fast ameliorates?
-Yes.

240
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:23,010
-Now you weep, you cry easily now?
-No.

241
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:27,760
-Even if you want, you can not?
-Even if I want, I can not.

242
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,550
-Even if you are alone at home?
-No.

243
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:43,520
-You can not cry. And you like to be with company or you like to be alone?

244
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:50,150
-I like company. I'm afraid to be alone.

245
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:13,470
-Do you like fruits?
-Yes.

246
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:17,070
-A lot?
-No.

247
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:31,530
-Would you say that your memory is not so good?
-No, I have no problem.

248
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:44,440
-The general energy how is it? Of your body?
-Normal.

249
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:50,950
-Would you say you have more energy than normal?

250
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:54,170
-Maybe, I don't know.

251
00:35:54,270 --> 00:36:02,350
-How many hours you sleep now?
-4-5 hours only.

252
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:08,750
-And this is enough for you to carry on?

253
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:13,850
-Sometimes yes but sometimes no, I wake up tired.

254
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:25,250
But in these 4 months of insomnia, I was not tired, I was fresh all the time

255
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:30,390
and I didn't sleep 1 week not at all.

256
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:41,100
And then 1,2 hours but OK.

257
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:50,890
-OK.

258
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:12,890
-You always sleep on the left side?
-Yes, if I have pains yes.

259
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:51,600
I like to sleep on the abdomen.

260
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:21,600
-OK, let's see.

261
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:50,430
This is a very instructive case from another point of view.

262
00:38:50,530 --> 00:39:05,140
This is a case where everybody could give Nat. mur. and with good reasons, as I said,

263
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:11,740
in these case I gave you. I could have given you this case actually saying all this.

264
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:19,110
You remember when we analyzed the case here, when I write, I said this is a case of

265
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:21,760
typical Nat. mur.

266
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:33,840
Yet when we took the case more thoroughly and with the knowledge of the different remedies,

267
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:44,010
we saw the possibility of another remedy which is Sepia.

268
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:57,660
Sepia is a remedy which can be indicated after grief that stops sexual desire.

269
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:12,170
Sexual desire is finished, is gone and an aversion to sex starts.

270
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:38,820
The case showed that it was going towards Sepia until the time she gave out certain symptoms

271
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,210
of Tarentula.

272
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:48,360
The symptoms of Tarentula where this inner hurriedness which is so strong in her

273
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:54,170
and it's quite deep, it goes back as far as she could remember.

274
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:02,670
What brought us to the idea of Tarentula? Can anybody tell me?

275
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,180
-Dancing.

276
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:10,350
-Everybody must hurry.

277
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:22,570
-Everybody must hurry is characteristic of Tarentula, also liking of the loud music and

278
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:27,420
also liking of dancing but Sepia also like dancing.

279
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:40,920
Sepia likes dancing with the idea of exercise that does good to Sepia.

280
00:41:55,670 --> 00:42:03,570
So here we have to decide between Nat. mur., Sepia and Tarentula and what

281
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:06,170
is going to be our first choice?

282
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:18,260
She was actually already given Nat. mur. by the fact I said this is typical Nat. mur.

283
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:25,010
So we can ask her now to see when did you take the remedy?

284
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:28,840
-3 days ago.

285
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:35,420
-Do you see any change?
-No.

286
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:42,180
-What potency?
-10M.

287
00:42:49,170 --> 00:43:02,820
So in this particular case we have the proof already that most probably Nat. mur.

288
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:11,430
is not going to do anything and therefore we left with the two choices of Tarentula or Sepia.

289
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:19,140
What is the first remedy to start with?
-Sepia.

290
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:28,290
You see now even if I did not remember she had taken and I said, it's good

291
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:29,800
you did not take Nat. mur.

292
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:49,450
I don't remember in the analysis where I have said, the desire for salt is missing but

293
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:55,930
it was so typical with the information it was given, so typical of Nat. mur.

294
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:06,930
We make the mistake but since she has taken already 30 medicines, now she has taken 31.

295
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:12,940
It's not very important.

296
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:25,350
The remedy with which we should start is Sepia high potency and perhaps she will need for

297
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:34,330
a few days because an organism who has taken a lot of wrong remedies the body does not

298
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:38,680
react anymore to one dose.

299
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:45,180
You have to touch the organism 3-4 times before you can create a reaction.

300
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:57,580
Slow acting remedy, not only Nat. mur., every remedy can be slow acting but you have

301
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:04,170
some indications from the beginning whether the remedy is going to act or not and

302
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:06,520
these indications are not here.

303
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:15,280
The question is, I have heard that Nat. mur. is a slow acting remedy.

304
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:19,380
Can it be a slow acting remedy so the Nat. mur. will...?

305
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:28,220
And I say yes remedies can be slow acting, you can wait if you like but in this particular case

306
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:36,740
actually nothing will happen and if Nat. mur. is indicated at all, it will be after Sepia.

307
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:47,890
First you have to give Sepia. Why? Because of the whole case as it appeared but most

308
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:53,740
particularly about the leucorrhea which is strong feature in this case.

309
00:45:54,270 --> 00:46:09,890
So leucorrhea with aversion to sex, leucorrhea in girls especially, shows that the remedy

310
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:13,740
you should start with is Sepia.

311
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:30,240
Maybe after Sepia if she develops desire for salt and sensitivity to sun, these two things

312
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:44,160
maybe she will need a dose of Nat. mur. before going into Tarentula.

313
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:56,060
If the hurried feeling, which belongs also to different other remedies, between them is the Nat. mur.,

314
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:03,990
if the hurried feeling does not go away, then you have to chose between Nat. mur. and Tarentula.

315
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:14,490
What I really believe it will happen, first she will take Sepia.

316
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:26,220
Then I believe she will feel better psychologically where maybe the back ache will become

317
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:33,900
even worse maybe, the headaches will be reduced, the back ache worse.

318
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,470
For a certain period of time the leucorrhea maybe even worse, a lot of leucorrhea

319
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:44,310
then the leucorrhea will start going down, then the pains will be more.

320
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:54,720
Then she most probably will develop some taste for salt and that is the time where Nat. mur.

321
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:56,070
should be repeated.

322
00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:10,060
And if these two remedies, first Sepia and then Nat.mur. do not complete the cure,

323
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:14,810
maybe the possibility of Tarentula is there and we can have it as a possibility

324
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:16,910
and we can use it later on.

325
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:51,310
-We know that Tarentula has very big desire for sex. This is not something which speaks

326
00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:52,810
against Tarentula?

327
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:55,310
-Yes, that's why we don't give Tarentula.

328
00:48:55,410 --> 00:49:01,670
-We must know change the desire for sex to give Tarentula?

329
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:09,310
-At this moment we don't give Tarentula. One of the reasons that we don't give is because

330
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:18,810
Tarentula has a lot of sex but later on maybe that changes and the desire starts

331
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:28,160
and its' quite bothering and also the insomnia remains and the hurriedness.

332
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:36,310
So this combination will take us there but before we go to Tarentula, we have to deal with

333
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:47,160
the emotional side, which at this moment is pointing to Sepia.

334
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:55,560
-I'm curious what lead you into the line of leucorrhea about the hurrying?

335
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:59,970
It was just the history of the dancing or did you see something that seemed that she was hurrying?

336
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:07,230
-No, I did not see Tarentula in her but the history of dancing together with better with

337
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:12,900
music, amelioration from music and dancing, this combination gives you

338
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,990
the idea of Tarentula already.

339
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:21,400
Now she said another symptom, a third symptom of Tarentula which is everybody must hurry.

340
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:27,390
I repeated 3 times this question if you remember. To make sure that the symptom

341
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:39,390
was really there and still I go along with the main symptomatology where she said

342
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:48,390
my feelings towards the other sex have been totally deadened and this is

343
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:56,910
particularly Sepia and not Tarentula.

344
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:06,150
So maybe after Sepia, Tarentula will be indicated but I said before

345
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:09,480
Tarentula we have to try again Nat. mur.

346
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:20,980
Because for the feelings to come back I think we need some time, they don't come back so easily.
