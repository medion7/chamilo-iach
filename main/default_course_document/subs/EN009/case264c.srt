1
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:32,060
-I start from the beginning. After two weeks all the physical problems reappeared.

2
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,310
-What was the prescription in May?

3
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:40,600
-It was Arsenicum.

4
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,560
-What potency?

5
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:56,560
-200 and after two weeks the migraine appeared which keeps for 2-3 days and

6
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:10,400
it is very strong and I start to sigh very often and very deep

7
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,000
and appeared some cramps.

8
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:35,580
When I try to stretch especially in the night or if I'm not attentive there is a cramp.

9
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:42,980
-Mostly where?
-It depends on the moving.

10
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,480
-In the extremities?

11
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:53,480
-In the extremities and here in the leg, this is the most strong.

12
00:01:53,580 --> 00:02:00,230
The first time keeps me 3 days, it's very strong and very painful,

13
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:11,650
not I'm very attentive to every move because ifI stretch too much,

14
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,750
it appears immediately.

15
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,500
-Find in the Repertory cramps after stretching in the extremities.

16
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:33,060
-Then it appears a back pain which is still now.

17
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,810
-Lumbar region?
-Yes lumbar region.

18
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:45,910
-Is it constant?
-Yes it's constant like blow, like after a blow.

19
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:06,820
Especially when I stand too much in the same place without moving,

20
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,910
the pain appears.

21
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,060
-And it is better when?

22
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,000
-It is better when I lie down.

23
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:36,360
Also it appeared some ecchymosis but without to blow myself, just appeared.

24
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,050
-They go away after a while?

25
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:48,150
-After 7-8 days they disappear.

26
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:57,350
-Did you check your blood? Platelets?-No.

27
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:07,720
-Then?

28
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:19,420
-Then it appeared when I start talking in the middle of the phrase I forget

29
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:28,140
what I want to say and I can not remember and this is ...

30
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,590
When I talk with a patient and I want to put a question and disappears,

31
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:43,650
I must find something else or I know the word, I have it in my mind but I can not express it.

32
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:54,150
It keeps 20-30 seconds and then I can say the word.

33
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,650
-Forgets what she wants to say.

34
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:17,890
-I have very great desire for coffee. For 5 years I didn't drink coffee, not at all

35
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:26,440
but if I startto drink, I can not stop. I drink 6 coffees, 7, 10, I can not stop.

36
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,640
-Lately did you drink?

37
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:35,970
-Lately no. For 4 years I didn't drink and I try to stop myself from drinking

38
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,020
but I have a great desire to drink coffee.

39
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:48,640
-Desire yes but what I ask is, did the last week drunk some coffee?

40
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,240
-Yes, a little one. I try not to drink much.

41
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,400
-Yes but I want to know how much.
-Half of a cup.

42
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,640
-How many times the day?

43
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:09,890
-Just once because I said to myself that I must not drink coffee.

44
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:21,570
-But you drunk only half a cup how many times?
-6 times, 10 times.

45
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,350
-Not a big crime.

46
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:41,300
-And it appeared a sensitivity in the noises, I cannot hear the clock in the room,

47
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:53,870
it disturbs me, it makes me nervous or hear somebody who is eating something croquant.

48
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:44,010
And the last physical thing is when I walk I feel in the toes numbness, it's like the toes

49
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:49,610
are not there. It disappears when I walk.

50
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:07,050
And the most important thing that happened was 3 weeks ago when a man

51
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:20,010
who was looking for me for 5 years called me and I accepted to see him and

52
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:35,870
after the first date I make love and we will marry in November.

53
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:47,520
-Congratulations. I think I predicted that. Very good.

54
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:58,030
-Yes, I opened myself incredible and just I can not believe that it is true, it's like a dream.

55
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:20,680
-You remember the previous state of course. Nothing else to report spontaneously?

56
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,110
-No.

57
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:42,000
-I want to ask you concerning the sighing? When did you notice that you are sighing so much?

58
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,590
How long after Arsenicum?

59
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,190
-Two weeks after Arsenicum.

60
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:56,840
-And the sighing continues. I saw you sighing when you started.

61
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:05,340
Now you are more calmp erhaps and this sighing continues even after this?

62
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,840
-It's a bit rare, it's not so often.

63
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:15,390
-After the last relationship?-Yes
.

64
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,590
-Let me ask you something else.

65
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:25,670
During this period from May until now did you have a specific desire for fruits or

66
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:32,420
in the contrary you remember not eating so much fruits?

67
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:45,690
-No. I have a desire for fruits but not very strong. It is more than before.

68
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:56,070
-And has anything changed in diet? That means you desire something now that you did

69
00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:07,570
not desired before? More salt or more pepper, more meat or fat?

70
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:19,670
-No, I don't like to eat too much meat now but nothing special.

71
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:27,210
-What about salami, smoked meat?

72
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:31,300
-I prefer not to eat them.

73
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,800
-Is it because of diet reasons?

74
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:41,150
-No, I don't like them. I prefer not to eat them.

75
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:49,210
-Concerning the temperature of your body has anything changed after Arsenicum?

76
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:52,210
You became more warm, more cold?

77
00:11:52,310 --> 00:12:05,580
-I' m a little cold than before and in the night I wake up trembling, I feel very cold.

78
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:11,110
-In general?-In general and internal cold.

79
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:27,010
-In bed do you have to wear socks in bed at night?
-No but the feet are cold.

80
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:35,980
-The feet are especially cold, more cold than before?

81
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:47,820
-I can say like before the first remedy. They are cold and they warm very slowly.

82
00:12:51,330 --> 00:13:00,230
-Very difficult to warm up.
-Yes and the insomnia appeared.

83
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:03,010
-What time do you have insomnia?

84
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:09,810
-3 a.m. I wake up and I can not sleep anymore.

85
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:15,060
-And you go until morning or after 2 hours you sleep again?

86
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:33,160
-No, until morning and I go to sleep late. At 12 or 1 o'clock.

87
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,810
-But this sleep is enough for you?

88
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:44,410
-It's not enough, I'm very tired and in the morning I'm very tired.

89
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:56,330
-The last two weeks when you started, you sleep better?
-No, I sleep worse.

90
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:06,730
-And that is something which you would explain somewhat?

91
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:13,120
-Yes I explain it but the sleeplessness was before.

92
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:24,970
-From May until this you had been sleeping, it was not a big deal your sleep.

93
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:38,470
-After 3 weeks I think, this insomnia appeared and at 3 o'clock in the morning I wake up

94
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:46,740
and in the morning I'm tired, I start working and I go to sleep at 12-1 o'clock and...

95
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:53,140
-Why do you go so late to sleep?
-Because I have a lot of work to do?

96
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,390
-So much work? What are you doing?

97
00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:07,890
-Translating the book and I have two jobs, I work in a private office also and I have

98
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:13,640
patients and I must repertorize.

99
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,140
-Do you enjoy the work?

100
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:20,490
-Yes, very much. I do it with pleasure.

101
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:30,890
-Tell me something. Do you cry more easily now?
-No, I can not cry.

102
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:36,650
-And you have not been crying even the last few weeks with this affair?

103
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:49,890
-No. I can not.
-Do you allow yourself to feel happy with this affair?

104
00:15:49,990 --> 00:16:04,560
-I'm very happy.
-That's very good. In sleep do you perspire?

105
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:13,310
-No. I perspire only when I have strong emotions.

106
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:16,830
-Like excitement?

107
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:28,670
-Yes and it's cold perspiration. Cold and clammy.

108
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:48,320
-Do you find yourself being more sloppy now than before?

109
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:58,820
I mean you don't make your room or you don't have time or you continue to be very orderly?

110
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,920
-Yes, very.

111
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:15,460
-Your nails do you bite them or do you cut them?
-No.

112
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:22,860
-And do they break easily?
-Now not.

113
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:32,920
-Before?-Before yes. When I'm cold they become blue black.

114
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,840
-When it was the last time that you had that?

115
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:49,320
-I think last week because in my country now it's very cold.

116
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:52,670
-Already.
-Yes.

117
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,200
-What about sweets? How much?

118
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:17,780
-I don't. I prefer ice-cream, chocolate but not too much.

119
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:30,580
-In your weight you lost some weight?
-Yes, I lost 6 kilos.

120
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:45,760
-Your thirst is normal or has increased?

121
00:18:45,860 --> 00:19:03,830
-My thirst has decreased. I didn't drink in the night as I used to and the day is normal.

122
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,230
-How are your fears?

123
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:31,030
-I still have strong fear of robbers. I lock all the doors and I stay with the fear

124
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:39,970
but if there is somebody in the house with me it's OK, I sleep well and no problem.

125
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:48,820
-What about fear from high places? Have you noticed any fear developing for high places?

126
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,620
-No.

127
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,370
-Thunderstorms?
-No.

128
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:58,710
-No other fear? Fear of dark?
-No.

129
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:05,650
-Do you have regular motion? Do you have any constipation?

130
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:19,270
-No, it's normal. In the last month it's soft stool, 2-3 times the day but not diarrhea.

131
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,920
-Diet has changed drastically?

132
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:42,440
-No, I eat less than before because of the program. I don't have time. I eat in foot and go.

133
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:06,620
-The urination has no problem.
-No problem.

134
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,840
-No special desire for urine?

135
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:22,520
-No. What I notified also was the menses are from 7-10 days, they are shorter now.

136
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:27,170
-With less blood also?

137
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:40,420
-No, the same amount but the days are shorter but it reappeared the leucorrhea

138
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,220
which is quite strong.

139
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:02,590
-How is your desire for sex?

140
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:11,930
-I have desire for sex but I'm afraid, I have not the courage, not yet.

141
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:27,190
-To let it go. But you had sex already?
-No, I haven't sex already.

142
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,950
-Oh I see.

143
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:40,690
-And I'm afraid. Everything has happened so quickly in such a short time, I cannot.

144
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:57,420
-You are not able to relax. But the desire you say is strong?
-It's quite strong.

145
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:05,020
-Very good, the hormonal system needs to work again after all.

146
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:16,260
Do you have any other change in the modalities of your menses?

147
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:21,510
That means before menses you become more irritable or anything like that?

148
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:31,010
-No, in the first month I had headaches, migraine before and two days

149
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:39,940
after the beginning of the menses and it was quite strong but now it's OK.

150
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:46,260
-It's normal. The menses are coming before you know even?

151
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:50,130
Do they come perhaps only in the day time?

152
00:23:50,230 --> 00:24:10,270
-They came 3-4 days before the normal and they are with many clots.

153
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,170
-Very dark?

154
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:33,430
-Very dark and they are many and I'm feeling better when I have clots than when I

155
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:35,520
haven't.

156
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,930
-But how many times you had the headache?

157
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:49,260
-Just one month after the Arsenicum.

158
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,400
-The leucorrhea is white, yellowish?

159
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:05,510
-Yellow, white and it's all the time.

160
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:20,440
-During that period did you see any constant increase or in the contrary it increased

161
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:23,690
until July and then decreased?

162
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:25,040
-No, it's constant.

163
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:31,400
-That means from when it started it is the same, no increase, no decrease.

164
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:39,750
-No. And it has a sweet smell.

165
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,400
-OK thank you.

166
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,750
-Thank you very much.

167
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:25,290
Let's see the symptoms. Cramps on stretching out the foot.

168
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:30,570
This, put it in third degree.

169
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,690
It has to be put in third degree.

170
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,540
This is what we have been saying.

171
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:43,850
When she says, with the least stretching I have to be aware this is a clear symptom,

172
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:52,770
clear, strong, intense 3 times. This is the idea. Who put it 3 times?

173
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:58,540
Can you please rise your hands?

174
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:06,340
8 only. That is no good for the class.

175
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:27,400
Immediately the idea of Calcarea comes to the picture. You got the right rubric.

176
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,660
You see the intensity, immediately Calc. carbonica comes.

177
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:41,290
You say maybe Cal. carb. but she said she was sighing very much. Show me sighing.

178
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:49,490
How many remedies we have capital in sighing? Strong sighing appears.

179
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:55,990
Therefore you go to the Repertory and you see how many remedies really sigh.

180
00:27:56,090 --> 00:28:07,340
One is the Ignatia, the other is Calc. phosh., the other is Cimicifuga

181
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:26,740
and the other is Bryonia, not so much. Ign, Calc.phos. and Cimic. are the remedies

182
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,880
which sigh very strongly.

183
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:43,070
Now you remember in this case, when we discussed this case because of the grief

184
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:49,420
we might have gone and give Ignatia, because of the grief.

185
00:28:50,170 --> 00:29:06,910
We did not give Ignatia. Now she has sighing. The thinking should be like this.

186
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:32,070
We have Sepia layer first and then we had some symptoms of Arsenicum which were

187
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:41,590
underneath and now she has some symptoms of Ignatia with big sighing.

188
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:55,900
Was she sighing in the beginning? For those who remember, did you write sighing? No.

189
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,750
Why now she is sighing?

190
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:22,440
Now the organism can tolerate the pain of the grief, on a more conscious level.

191
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:39,620
Before the organism could not handle the grief and went into a deeper level, Sepia.

192
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:52,340
Sepia, more dizzy, not clear, no sighing.

193
00:30:54,340 --> 00:31:01,990
And then you take away the Sepia first layer and then there is another layer of Arsenicum

194
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:07,340
with fears etc. and what we have decided in the analysis.

195
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:20,740
And now sighing, sighing, sighing all the time which shows that the grief is now taken up

196
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:35,490
by the organism and what is interested is, we asked how is the sighing the last 3 weeks?

197
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:39,990
She says, better. The sighing is better.

198
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:53,590
That means already the relationship takes care of that level in a way.

199
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:58,590
We don't know how far, how much.

200
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:13,740
What is interesting is, you must ask, if this is an Ignatia layer, shouldn't we have

201
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:21,290
another symptom, a few symptoms to confirm the Ignatia layer

202
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:26,000
and we investigate in this direction.

203
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:35,500
Do we have really an Ignatia layer or in our thinking we are making a mistake in the analysis?

204
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:45,660
You understand what I mean? Fruits? Do you need more fruits? Less fruits?

205
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:52,810
No big change there, there is no an aversion to fruit to indicate that definitely

206
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:54,910
we have a layer of Ignatia.

207
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:07,560
Then we go to the pathology. We look the pathology which is the  cramps mostly,

208
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,910
no Ignatia there.

209
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:29,060
Then the thinking should go, sighing a lot and Calc. appears in the cramps,

210
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:33,910
what then should we be thinking about?

211
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:44,380
We should think of Calc. phosporica. We have to investigate the possibility of Calc.

212
00:33:44,480 --> 00:34:00,380
phosp. All these lumbar cramping, there is a cramp here which affects the sciatic nerves

213
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:15,330
and the organism now has done what? It has taken the grief that was deep inside into the

214
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:24,850
emotional level and brought it down as cramping on the physical level.

215
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:33,210
This is the explanation from the pathology point of view and from understanding that we

216
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:35,710
have of the human being.

217
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:44,720
The organism therefore has become strong and now the grief is these cramps appearing

218
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:50,310
in the lumbar region and in the legs. It's beautiful.

219
00:34:52,070 --> 00:35:01,320
But maybe she comes like this and then cramps and the toes are numbed.

220
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:15,180
Then what shall we do? Here is the point where most of the mistakes are made.

221
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:25,240
At this junction. You make a mistake and you will see very interesting developments.

222
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:39,220
So a lot of thinking has to be done in analyzing that state now in which she is

223
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:50,400
because what we are looking for, we are looking for a clear picture, the third layer.

224
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:12,650
So is this a case of Calc. carb., of Calc. phos., of Ignatia, of Cimicifuga, of Phos. acid?

225
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:20,800
The memory is affected quite strongly, in the middle of a sentence I forget

226
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,430
what I want to say.

227
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,050
-Desire coffee is a symptom?

228
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:43,320
-Yes, you can put it as a symptom strong, 3 times.

229
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:54,570
She could spoil the treatment if she goes into coffee, you must know that.

230
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:05,710
What is it going to happen if she drinks coffee now at that stage?

231
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:09,970
We have to discuss this also. What is going to happen to her?

232
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,380
-Falling back.

233
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,130
-Falling back to what?

234
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:22,710
-To Sepia. You remember we have discussed this. I said, you take this out.

235
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:29,880
If you take out the second layer, then antidote the second layer,

236
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,730
then the first layer will come up.

237
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:45,140
She will not go all the way through to the original because of the coffee.

238
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:49,880
You remember the original case, how she was feeling emotional and all that.

239
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:54,480
She will not go to that original state by drinking coffee.

240
00:37:55,230 --> 00:38:04,710
By drinking coffee, she will fall back into the original Sepia, what happened after Sepia.

241
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:08,470
You remember she described this after May.

242
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:14,880
Then if she keeps drinking coffee, then eventually she will fall back into

243
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:19,480
the original state but maybe not entirely.

244
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:30,130
-Is it possible that she could fall back into the Sepia state even though Arsenicum

245
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:35,730
has already unfolded its efficiency or has worked through completely?

246
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:58,380
-Sure. Sepia on a different level. We treat Sepia on a mental level and then another

247
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:01,480
remedy is needed, Arsenicum.

248
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:17,150
And then the Sepia picture may reappear on a purely physical level, leucorrhea and cramps.

249
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:30,970
So we have cycles of remedies but if your prescription is correct, then the disease

250
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:38,070
will come down, the disturbance will come down from mental, emotional to physical.

251
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:48,380
It is the observation of these old masters like Kent. Kent also said, sometimes you have

252
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,310
cases that come in cycle, Sulphur, Calcarea, Lycopodium.

253
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:59,970
You may repeat 3 times this cycle before the patient is correct.

254
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:10,070
Therefore the possibility of Sepia is coming again now as on physical level.

255
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:16,470
-Numbness she said during walking.

256
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:25,890
-Numbness on foot, Phos. acid is there, Causticum, Aconitum and Cyclamen.

257
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:41,400
Cramps on legs, on calves was Sepia there, yes or no? Who says no?

258
00:40:55,900 --> 00:41:15,130
Cramps in calves on stretching. There was Sepia. Nobody knows.

259
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:24,630
I lead you to Calc. carb. Somebody says, wait, with this leucorrhea it might be again Sepia.

260
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:32,720
Yes it might be Sepia and you see it from the leucorrhea and from this tendency of Sepia

261
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,820
to produce the cramps on the calves.

262
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:48,050
Desire for coffee we see it in Angustura vera. Are all these the remedies?

263
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:51,680
-Yes, only two are missing here.

264
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:20,650
-Some additions. The Calcar. phos. is there, the Sepia is not there.

265
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:31,970
So she desires a stimulant there is no question. She desires a stimulant because she is tired,

266
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:37,380
because she is not sleeping so well and therefore she does not have some energy

267
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,630
and the organism is craving.

268
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:49,880
So the desire for coffee is a symptom which you just put a question mark whether

269
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:56,360
it is a real symptom or something that she knows she can get energy from.

270
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:02,420
When I feel very tired, I drink coffee to my detriment.

271
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:06,810
I will die 10 years earlier because of that.

272
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:15,730
-I saw in few of the symptoms also Nux vomica and she said she is very irritated and

273
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:19,580
she doesn't sleep and there is a lot of things of Nux vomica that also come up.

274
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:24,080
-Put sleeplessness after 3.

275
00:43:51,080 --> 00:44:04,330
That's it. Magnesia carbon., Arsen., Sepia, Nux vom. is only on a second place.

276
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:18,250
Actually this particular it is very much like Sepia, Magnes. carb. and Sulphur.

277
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:25,080
Thuja and Tubercul. I don't know why they are so strong here.

278
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:41,820
Arsenicum I don't know it is so strong. Sepia, Magn. carb. and Sulphur I know to have that

279
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,670
type of sleeplessness.

280
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:57,810
Mostly now the problem is the cramps, the pains in the bag, the legs and the memory.

281
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:07,250
These are the problems. What shall we give?

282
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:13,150
We have a possibility for Sepia, Calcarea Calc. phoshp.

283
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:28,420
She says, she has cold and clammy perspiration. What reminds you this perspiration?

284
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:32,820
Which remedy? Calc. carbon.

285
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:38,100
The first remedy that you have to think when a patient says

286
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:43,250
I have cold and clammy perspiration is Calc. carb.

287
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:53,820
Now is she in a Calc. carb.? She desires ice cream.

288
00:45:53,920 --> 00:46:02,920
The way she said it, is it really desire? Very doubtful.

289
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:11,750
Desire is for coffee but coffee is needed to have more energy.

290
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:21,500
So therefore Angustura, I would not go to that extend.

291
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:32,500
What is important in her case for those who remember the first interview.

292
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:49,750
Can you see the difference in inner relaxation? The soul has been relaxed.

293
00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:11,400
It is impressive for me because I feel the patient, I feel the inner state and to see that

294
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:21,000
state and that state, for me is day and night. It was a state of total cramp inside.

295
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:29,910
A soul that was cramped inside. Now it is only cramped in the physical body and the

296
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:44,220
inner self has relaxed. This is how far Homeopathy can go. It is not a miracle working.

297
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:52,720
It is a very systematic methodology and that's why we discuss very carefully now,

298
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:55,330
not to make a mistake.

299
00:47:56,820 --> 00:48:01,670
So we have another possibility, Ars, Sepia, Cal, Cal. phos and Ignatia.

300
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:31,000
We have 5 possibilities to choose among. Who is in favor of repeating Arsenicum? 11.

301
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:56,750
Who is in favor of Sepia? 11. Who is favor of Calc. carb? 11.

302
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:13,920
That is a super natural phenomena. Who is in favor of Calc. phos? 9

303
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:36,670
Ignatia? 4. Most of the class remained silent and did not want to make a decision.

304
00:49:40,420 --> 00:50:10,320
Who wants to wait? 36. It's 36. We can count them. This is the easiest, the more safe but

305
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:21,960
she may find herself in pain and what it may happen, she may go into a state of lumbago very strong.

306
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:25,720
What is she going to do?

307
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:33,710
So if you are a good doctor, you have to foresee what is going to happen to give some direction

308
00:50:33,810 --> 00:50:39,050
because by the time she will fall, she will take anything.

309
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:53,960
So by the time that she will have the lumbago, if she can not contact you who is the doctor

310
00:50:54,060 --> 00:51:08,790
and she is already becoming homeopath, she will have to search between these two remedies,

311
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:13,310
most probably the remedy is either Sepia or Calc. carbonica.

312
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:21,710
I can not say at this moment whether it will be Sepia again or Calc. carbon. but

313
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:25,410
she is sensitive to both these remedies.

314
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:34,790
So if the wrong one will be prescribed, it will affect the case but it will not push the case forward.

315
00:51:34,890 --> 00:51:36,640
It will confuse it.

316
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:48,710
So by the time she will have a severe lumbago, she will have to think about these two remedies

317
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:55,130
but maybe a third one will appear, if you have a specific symptom that points

318
00:51:55,230 --> 00:52:03,140
to another remedy. Show me fear of robbers.

319
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:21,290
But fear of robbers is not in the same intensity as it was in May. Here we have Ignatia

320
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:35,140
which is a possibility, as we said, Arsenicum of course.

321
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:59,540
-We left off the symptom perspiration emotions after and that has 3 remedies,

322
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,640
the one of them is Sepia.

323
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,560
-Cold perspiration after emotions.

324
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:20,980
-That was a very interesting observation. Where did you find it?

325
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:28,980
-Perspiration emotions after, page 1495 in the perspiration.

326
00:53:39,730 --> 00:53:46,480
-Yes 3 remedies Physostigma , Rhus tox and Sepia.

327
00:53:57,230 --> 00:54:01,880
You remember when I said in the beginning how you underline?

328
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:08,380
If this was a reliable symptom, it is added by somebody whom I don't know, I don't know

329
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:13,790
how reliable it is but let us that symptom is reliable.

330
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:22,290
Then it happens, when I said that a symptom is told by the patient but we just forget

331
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:27,290
about it, we don't pay attention to that and maybe that is a clue

332
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:28,890
because of that peculiar symptom.

333
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:41,040
So if the rubric was cold, clammy perspiration after emotions, then it is exactly and

334
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:49,090
maybe we have to pay attention, as long as the recording is reliable.

335
00:54:53,810 --> 00:55:02,400
As I told you from Kneer's Repertory which comes from Herring's symptoms,

336
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:05,000
you know the 10 volumes Herring's?

337
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:13,230
You have a Repertory called Kneer's Repertory where he records the symptoms of

338
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:21,530
the Materia Medica and many times I have seen the exact words of the patient

339
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:30,030
found in one remedy only. Magnesia phos. has that particular symptom, you give it

340
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:36,030
and it doesn't work and many many times - that's why in the morning I told you

341
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:39,630
forget about this, you don't pay attention.

342
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:47,370
What you pay attention is on the main structure of the remedy because these symptoms

343
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:49,220
are not so reliable.

344
00:55:54,220 --> 00:56:07,120
Who is PK? Phatak? Phatak means comes from Herring's Materia Medica, it means from

345
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:20,200
Kneer's Repertory, that's what we have been talking about because Phatak uses a lot of

346
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:22,800
information from Herring's Materia Medica.

347
00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:34,760
These are good as indications but not to go and say yes that's it.

348
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:43,860
Because if this information is absolutely reliable then Sepia is most indicated again for her.

349
00:56:58,850 --> 00:57:04,420
-It says that in the cases of menses where there are both clots and it comes earlier,

350
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:08,510
Calc. carb. is indicated much more than Sepia.

351
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:10,960
-Put menses with clots.

352
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:17,850
-And also menses frequent to earlier.

353
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:43,830
-Where is Calcarea? Sabina, Crocus, Belladonna, we don't have Sepia, Calc. carb.

354
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:45,930
Arsenicum.

355
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:31,930
Calc. phos. also is there, Camomilla...

356
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:51,850
This symptom here, dark clotted, how many times you can underline that symptom.

357
00:58:54,850 --> 00:59:06,100
The way she says it, she says I have many times menses clotted and I feel good.

358
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:11,600
Some other times they are not clotted and I don't feel so good.

359
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:20,850
How you underline that symptom? You underline 1,2 or 3 times?

360
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:45,350
Who underlines once? Who underlines twice? Who underlines 3 times? Very lonely.

361
00:59:47,100 --> 01:00:00,000
So most of the class will underline it twice, this is correct. You underline, it is quite strong

362
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:13,600
but not absolutely in frequency, it's clear, it's strong but not in frequency absolutely.

363
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:19,100
So you go a little bit down on the third. Take another symptom.

364
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:37,180
For instance desires coffee, who has underline it in your paper 3 times? OK.

365
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:49,830
Who has underlined it twice? And who has underlined it once?

366
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:59,550
Most people is 3 times, very close to those with 2 times.

367
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:13,540
The way you hear it is between 2-3 times, that's correct but when you think the way I thought

368
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:20,630
or I explained it, I may not take it into consideration at all or I put it one time.

369
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:32,530
Just not because she did not say it strongly but if there is something that gives you energy

370
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:35,210
and you are used to take.

371
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:41,860
You are used to take coffee 4 years ago?

372
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:44,620
-Yes.

373
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:51,530
-So you know the effect of the coffee, you remember. So this is what she said, for 4 years

374
01:01:51,630 --> 01:01:59,540
I did not drink coffee but I have the need for coffee. She remembers the energy that

375
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:06,630
coffee can give her, she does not sleep, of course, then it calms down.

376
01:02:07,910 --> 01:02:20,630
Why at the same time the symptom perspiration from emotions, how much you underline?

377
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:44,130
Who has underlined it once? Who has underlined it twice and who 3 times?

378
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:55,030
This symptom is between 2 and 3 times because it is strange, we have only a few

379
01:02:55,130 --> 01:03:01,030
symptoms, and she has said it quite clearly. Because it is strange, because it has been

380
01:03:01,130 --> 01:03:08,730
described clearly in a few remedies, that we take into consideration very seriously.

381
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:23,960
Next symptom. Forgets the words while speaking. Who has underlined it once?

382
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:33,460
Who has underlined it twice? Who has underlined 3 times?

383
01:03:36,710 --> 01:03:42,130
This symptom the way she said it, you can underline it 3 times.

384
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:15,530
We have Baryta carb. and Helleborus, Phos. acid is lower, Sepia is not there, Calc.

385
01:04:15,630 --> 01:04:20,630
carb. is not there, Cal. phos. is not there, Arsenicum is not there.

386
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:35,130
-Which of the two we take?

387
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:53,880
-Both. There is another rubric also which you can use also...

388
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:25,730
Ecchymosis, how many times you underlined? Who underlined once? Twice? 3 times?

389
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:28,210
Once.

390
01:05:32,210 --> 01:05:34,970
-We didn't mention her sensitivity to noises.

391
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:49,410
-We didn't mention sensitivity to noises. Slight noise or any noise?

392
01:05:50,410 --> 01:05:52,130
-Clock.

393
01:05:56,380 --> 01:06:09,110
-Low noise and repeated sound but you said something about paper.

394
01:06:09,210 --> 01:06:17,960
-Not paper, when somebody is eating something an apple or chips I can't stand.

395
01:06:20,130 --> 01:06:28,880
Or I leave or I say stop or I start to eat myself.

396
01:06:30,130 --> 01:06:31,630
-This is the best.

397
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:40,480
-There is exactly the rubric sensitive to noises when others eating apples.

398
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:41,700
-What is the remedy?

399
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:56,550
-Lyssinum. When somebody is eating apples, which is what she says.

400
01:06:58,050 --> 01:07:06,450
This is what I say, in this little information, you don't go and give Lyssinum in this case

401
01:07:06,550 --> 01:07:12,880
but sometimes it will happen that you need this information.

402
01:07:28,130 --> 01:07:37,880
This is very strange. The Uva I never added Uva in this. There are a lot of things.

403
01:07:43,630 --> 01:07:57,030
Uva is the shell of the egg, Asarum is very strong of course and I have added this,

404
01:07:57,130 --> 01:08:06,130
this is true, I don't believe is Kent who said it but I said this to be upgraded,

405
01:08:07,390 --> 01:08:09,130
Coffea and Theridion.

406
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:17,800
So Sepia is t here which was added by Gala Barden.

407
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:36,520
After you have analyzed all this case very carefully then you come to the decision that

408
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:38,870
she will have to take Platina.

409
01:08:56,370 --> 01:09:09,190
The right decision at this moment is that we don't prescribe a remedy. We wait to see

410
01:09:09,290 --> 01:09:17,290
whether she will develop into Sepia state or Calc. carb. state or to Platina or whatever.

411
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:37,020
-One more point for Calc. phos. The offensive leucorrhea with the sweetish smell

412
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:44,130
is rather peculiar symptom and there are only two remedies and one is Calc. phos.

413
01:09:44,230 --> 01:09:45,130
-The other one?

414
01:09:45,230 --> 01:09:48,040
-Mercurius corrosivus.

415
01:09:49,930 --> 01:09:55,540
-Yes that is true. Another peculiar symptom is the sweetish smell of leucorrhea which

416
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:58,080
we did not pay attention.

417
01:09:58,180 --> 01:10:05,090
Actually I had decided long ago that this case will go without a remedy of course

418
01:10:05,190 --> 01:10:13,030
but you don't decide you go without remedy because you like it.

419
01:10:13,770 --> 01:10:20,280
Because you feel it's not Calc. it's not Cal. phos., it's not Sepia, it's not Arsenicum, wait.

420
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:32,700
And then you expect one of these remedies to develop. What will be the remedy?

421
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:39,430
We don't know, maybe she comes next May and a beautiful picture of Calc. phos. and

422
01:10:39,530 --> 01:10:42,030
then the whole class says, Calc. phos.

423
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:53,680
You have to be patient and you don't have to cure the patient, the way the patient likes

424
01:10:53,780 --> 01:11:02,090
because she likes of course to get rid of the leucorrhea and not to be cramped

425
01:11:03,190 --> 01:11:09,190
but you don't like it. You wait, you give placebo.

426
01:11:09,690 --> 01:11:15,590
The matter remains that we can not at this moment decide that this is a case of Calc.

427
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:22,940
carb. Do you like eggs? I didn't want to ask the key question. Do you like eggs?

428
01:11:23,690 --> 01:11:38,190
You like. Very much? What type of eggs? Soft boiled. That is another point for Calc. carb.

429
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:50,340
Still I would be careful not to give Calc. carb. I still will be careful but I will say watch out.

430
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:59,510
Most probably you are going to develop Calc. carb. with the lumbago, with the cramps.

431
01:11:59,610 --> 01:12:08,090
She is developing but we want to improve the health, we don't want to be in a hurry and

432
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:09,340
spoil the case.

433
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:16,180
Sweets? She says, I'm not interested. That point alone...

434
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:21,680
I ask do you perspire in bed during sleep, she says not at all.

435
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:28,210
OK, these two keynotes I don't have for confirming Calc. carb.

436
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:37,960
If it was a first time case I say OK we have to prescribe Calc. but now the way that

437
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:44,360
develops the case with all these changes, I better be careful.

01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:53,090
So she is going towards the Calc. carbon., we will see in May perhaps what is happening.

439
01:12:54,190 --> 01:13:01,340
-But she is looking to a very happy life now, could it be that with all these happy events

440
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:05,180
the body can recover totally by itself?

441
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:14,190
-Yes, of course, we wait, we'll see. Because the body is at a process of recovering.

442
01:13:14,290 --> 01:13:22,930
At the same time it has a positive shock. Already the sighing is reduced, the cramps are not

443
01:13:23,030 --> 01:13:27,530
reduced and also the leucorrhea is not reduced.

444
01:13:27,630 --> 01:13:31,760
Do you remember I asked, the leucorrhea is diminishing?

445
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:38,260
These are important questions to evaluate whether we should give a remedy or not.

446
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:45,270
Is the leucorrhea much more? That could take us towards the Sepia.

447
01:13:45,370 --> 01:13:51,860
If the leucorrhea was increasing constantly, that would take us towards Sepia again.

448
01:13:52,610 --> 01:14:06,260
The cold and clammy sweat take us directly to Calc. carb. but perspiration from emotions

449
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:13,360
confuse you again because it takes you back to some other remedies which is not Calc.

450
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:23,270
Therefore we better wait with the possibility that this case will go either to Calc. or Sepia.

451
01:14:25,110 --> 01:14:25,620
Thank you
