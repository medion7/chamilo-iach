1
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:39,400
-So last time you took Aurum 200, actually we spoke after you have given the case,

2
00:00:39,500 --> 00:01:00,250
not here because here I have written wait. I told you to take Aurum or... ?

3
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:19,870
-No, in September you told me to repeat Aurum and I was repeated 3rd time already

4
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:32,870
till December when I had the divorce, I repeated another 2 times.

5
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:49,790
In December I had the divorce and my divorce was in a break, in a Course,

6
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,530
I go and sign the paper and then I go back to the Course.

7
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:14,030
So I haven't realized what was happening because I had another week of Course and...

8
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,180
-You were busy.

9
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:34,680
-Yes but in January I had a depression and I sent you a fax and you told me

10
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,030
to take Aurum 50M.

11
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:47,030
I haven't had that potency, I couldn't find in the country.

12
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:58,280
I speak with one of the colleagues in Germany and she said, OK I send you the potency

13
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:09,280
and I said OK until I receive the potency let's solve some stomatological problems

14
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:23,030
and it happened something strange.

15
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:38,430
That machine which makes a hole in the teeth suddenly makes a noise

16
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:44,530
and that thing burning in 90 degrees and cut my tongue.

17
00:03:54,530 --> 00:04:02,230
I couldn't explain what has happened and I didn't realize what happened.

18
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:19,450
In one moment I felt all my mouth full of blood and in that moment I had panic,

19
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:30,700
I stop the hemorrhage and then I looked and I saw a cut of 3 cm quite deep.

20
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:50,180
It was inside of the tongue, not on the surface and after one week

21
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:57,030
I should have a Course and I couldn't speak.

22
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:27,180
So I took Symphytum 30 for 1 week every day and I could speak after 10 days and now when

23
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:36,280
I talk too much without break I feel a numbness in that place on the tongue.

24
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:54,230
So I finished with the tongue and I said OK let's see if I have something else.

25
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:12,350
My dentist said that I had fistula in one of my teeth and I feel it and there are

26
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:26,350
only 2 solutions, to take it off but I must (?) to treat homeopathically or

27
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,230
to make an operation.

28
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:39,180
I didn't want to take antibiotics because I'm allergic, she didn't want to take me off,

29
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:48,690
homeopathically I didn't know what to do, so it's still there.

30
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:12,180
In this period I have 4-5 biliary colics, very severe. It keeps me 2-3 days one colic,

31
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,940
very painful.

32
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,430
-How is the pain?

33
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:36,600
-To the back and here is like a heaviness and like a knife, it's extreme.

34
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:40,600
In the first day it's extreme.

35
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,680
-You had an X-ray?

36
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:59,930
-No, I made once a sonograph and they said that it's dyskinesia without stones.

37
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:20,720
Since October I can not recover, I am very tired. I wake up in the morning and I'm already tired.

38
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,820
-Unrefreshed from sleep.

39
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:33,180
-Yes. I have desire to sleep, I want to sleep but I can not.

40
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:50,240
In the afternoon I have no time to sleep but in the night I can not fall asleep before 12-1 o'clock.

41
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:58,190
-Why? You are very awake?
-Yes but I'm very tired at the same time.

42
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,740
I can not sleep, I can not fall asleep because I'm too tired.

43
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:12,670
-But still you are very awake, your mind is clear?

44
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:20,490
-Yes my mind is clear but I'm very tired. I have less energy.

45
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:29,740
I have nightmares very frequent.

46
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,270
-What kind?

47
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:54,490
-Someone wants to kill me or I'm in a funeral or I see somebody makes a crime.

48
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:07,560
Last night it was a snake which was following me and after every nightmare I scream

49
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,650
and I wake up screaming.

50
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:23,090
This happened about 3-4 o'clock in the morning and I can not fall asleep again because

51
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:37,550
when I try to go to sleep again, the dream reappear and I come in the dream again

52
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,940
and I wake up again.

53
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:45,310
-So every night you have a nightmare?

54
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:57,190
-Yes, I'm here and I had 5 nightmares and mostly they want to kill me or to push me into

55
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:14,040
the dark, or I see a crime or I'm in a cemetery and last night it was that snake.

56
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:26,850
And I realized about 2 months ago that I have fear of snakes, it's strange because

57
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:40,610
in my town there are no snakes in the city but when I enter in the house, especially when

58
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:47,700
I come in the evening I search the house to see that there are no snakes.

59
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:02,450
Also I have from time to time erotic dreams.

60
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:22,270
I have also very strong migraines that keeps me 3-4 days, sometimes they are connected with

61
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:24,120
the menses, sometimes not.

62
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:49,870
My menses are irregular. In March I had 1 full month of menses, 30 days with a lot of blood.

63
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:57,870
From time to time when I wake up I see the pillow is wet and I suppose it's because of saliva.

64
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:18,620
I have constipation, it's every day and the stool is very hard, I have also hemorrhoids

65
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:39,790
and when they start bleeding, the bleed for 2-3 days. I also have a painful coition and

66
00:14:49,040 --> 00:15:01,790
after it's bleeding. It's bleeding between 5-10 days after, it's not menses.

67
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:07,940
-But is this bleeding because of irritation of the mucus membranes of the vagina?

68
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:24,230
-I don't know. It's very painful and after it starts bleeding. I don't know why.

69
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:39,440
-Can you wear something around your neck?
-Usually not, I must be naked here.

70
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:45,440
-Around the abdomen?
-It's not a problem here, I can.

71
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,620
-How much salt do you take?
-Usual.

72
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:07,370
-Pepper? You like a special pepper?
-No, in every food I put a little.

73
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,900
-Black pepper?
-No red.

74
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:22,700
-In every food you put red pepper?
-Yes not too much. When I cook.

75
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:30,200
-Not in your fried potatoes?
-No.

76
00:16:49,450 --> 00:17:01,200
-You are warmer than before?
-I think now I'm normal.

77
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:10,510
-The position you sleep?
-On the abdomen only.

78
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,010
-There is no perspiration during sleep?
-No.

79
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:33,460
-But you said the salivation is because of the position most probably?

80
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,810
-I don't know.

81
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:43,820
-This salivation was not there before?
-No. A couple of months.

82
00:17:53,580 --> 00:18:01,470
-In the tooth where you say there is a fistula, do you have problems, pain?

83
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:10,570
-No but I must evacuate twice the week.

84
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,820
-The fistula?
-Yes.

85
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:26,310
It is accumulated in a bag and then I must pressure it to take it out.

86
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,820
-And there is no pain?
-No.

87
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:55,300
I desire company all the time. I must be with somebody, I can not stand to be alone.

88
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,660
-And you feel better with company?

89
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:12,970
-Better. Now in the last week, from Monday I'm alone and I can not stand.

90
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,220
I feel day by day...

91
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:31,620
-Would you say that you have fear in the night of being alone or is it not real fear?

92
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:38,800
-It's not but I sleep better if it is somebody in the house with me.

93
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:55,750
-Your appetite for sweets is bigger, smaller?
-I think it's a little bigger.

94
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:05,260
-There is any abdominal distention or gas?
-No.

95
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:28,620
-This fear for snakes and nightmares also about snakes is?

96
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:41,380
-Yes nightmares, last night it was a terror because that snake was following me everywhere

97
00:20:41,480 --> 00:21:01,220
and it was deformed and I woke up screaming. I heard myself screaming.

98
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:14,010
-Would you say that you have developed jealousy?

99
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:26,970
-I don't know, I don't think so but I'm very possessive in a relationship.

100
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:39,950
I don't think I'm jealous but I want to be only mine.

101
00:21:44,170 --> 00:22:01,320
If I will see with another person, it's no problem if I trust him, no problem but my feeling

102
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,760
is he must be mine.

103
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:20,410
-When you go to bed how long it takes you after you are in bed to fall asleep and how

104
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:23,000
you feel that period of time?

105
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:30,410
You go to bed 11 o'clock and until 12 o'clock you can not fall asleep or you go to bed

106
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,790
12 o'clock and at 12.45 you fall asleep?

107
00:22:39,250 --> 00:23:07,150
-Usually I go to bed between 10 and 11 and I open the TV and I put it for 2 hours and

108
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:24,590
usually I fall asleep at 12.30-1 o'clock because when I'm not totally asleep I hear it finished.

109
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:35,670
-But during this time it is difficult for you, you battle to sleep, you have an aggravation

110
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:37,000
at that time?

111
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:52,450
-Usually I try to sleep but it appears a fear when I'm alone. It can be fear of dark

112
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:12,410
and it can be fear of somebody entering the house, it's something I can not say exactly

113
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:21,500
what it's happening but it's a fear. I'm more secure when I'm not alone.

114
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:33,000
When I'm not alone I can go to bed at 10 o'clock and sleep until 3-4 in the morning.

115
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,910
-When you have company you go to bed and you sleep.

116
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:42,510
-Yes, usually.

117
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:03,670
-Salt how much you like?
-Normal.

118
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:12,170
-Sweet is more?
-Yes but not too much.

119
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:20,090
-Sweet is only once, desire for company 3 times.

120
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:41,430
If you are in a high place and you look down, you have problem?

121
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:56,360
-Yes I do not approach too much in the border, I stay... because I have a fear that I may fall.

122
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:40,350
-The fear of snakes you develop how long ago?
-I think 2-3 months ago.

123
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:49,520
-If you see on television snakes, you will close the television?

124
00:26:53,550 --> 00:27:09,170
-I saw one night, it was Hitskok movie with a lot of snakes and I was curious how it will

125
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:22,770
end but in that night I didn't sleep at all because I closed the eyes and I saw the snakes.

126
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,020
Open, close I saw the snakes.

127
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:34,020
-But after that you develop the fear?
-No it was before. It was before.

128
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:38,930
-But how it was before the fear and you kept on looking at the movie?

129
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:54,170
-Because I can not see when it is on TV, on animal planet, I have a fear and since I'm

130
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,520
here it's very strong.

131
00:28:52,680 --> 00:29:07,180
Sometimes at home I can go to bed and before make the bed, I search, maybe a snake is there.

132
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,180
It's not very often but it happens.

133
00:29:44,680 --> 00:30:11,080
-OK, you will take a dose of Lac Caninum 200. We're thinking of Lachesis, Argen. nitr.

134
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:21,570
Lycopodium but I prefer Lac can. because Lac can. is strong desire for company

135
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:28,170
and their fear is quite peculiar.
