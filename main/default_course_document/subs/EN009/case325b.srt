1
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:37,450
-Tell us last time you were here for main problems. Tell us the main problems.

2
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:50,700
-I used to have cramps mainly in the night in the calves and pain in the chest

3
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,140
which rises up from the stomach going upwards.

4
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,700
-And in the heart she said.

5
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,540
-Yes in the left side in the heart. I couldn't fall asleep at night because

6
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:09,370
I had to get up because of the pain in the calf, I needed to walk a little bit.

7
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:21,870
I began in September with Causticum 7CH and I didn't feel no difference

8
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:27,470
but my friends around reflected that I seem to be much more relaxed.

9
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:37,870
I went to 8CH and then I began to feel very tired that I need to sleep all the time.

10
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:44,720
Because of that I missed a few lectures in the last seminar in Alonissos.

11
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:59,370
At that time I felt a lot of relief from the death of my father and I even could dance

12
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:04,650
although I was very tired in the party in the seminar, something which I couldn't believe

13
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:09,650
I would be able to feel because I have much grief.

14
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:22,200
After two weeks I went up to the 12CH and then I began to feel very agitated

15
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:30,460
and nervous about injustice, political, social injustice, in the work, everything

16
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,300
looked to me injustice.

17
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:39,040
Therefore she sent the (?) at the Academy and for some reason it was not included

18
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:47,060
in the marks and she sent you a fax very angry, she was very frustrated about it.

19
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:52,890
In her fax she expressed her injustice about it. It was very bitter.

20
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:59,790
-She was not included in the marks which she sent, not included?

21
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:09,790
-I was here in turn 3 and at turn 4 my father died and I couldn't come, so I sent the (?)

22
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:15,290
with my friend and when I came again at turn 5 I saw that I received no mark

23
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:21,290
and I said to myself I'm coming here just for studying and I didn't allow it to come up

24
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:27,290
but when I went back to Israel, then an explosion came up and I couldn't sleep at night,

25
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:31,400
I was so frustrated and angry, I couldn't sleep.

26
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,800
-By that time she was on 12CH?

27
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:51,050
-Yes she continued with 12CH. At that time also I belonged to the Union of doctors

28
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:57,550
in Israel and at that time I began to speak at every meeting and to express my anger

29
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:03,130
about the injustice because one of the doctors there were doing terrible things.

30
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:13,730
And until all the problems were resolved I didn't dare to come down here again.

31
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:18,980
At that time, when I used to drive or walk in the morning, listening to the news

32
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:27,060
on the radio, I got so angry about Benjamin Netanyahu the ex-Prime Minister,

33
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:33,890
I was so angry, I used to vibrate, to shiver all over the body.

34
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:43,140
Then I began to feel that lids in the eyes get itchy and then they became swollen

35
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:51,330
and then I saw the development of eczema on the eyelids and then I stopped the 12CH.

36
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:59,730
I saw doctor (?) in Israel and I told him all the symptoms which rise up,

37
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:18,730
she belongs to a working group in Israel with doctor (?) and while she saw him there

38
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:24,730
in this group and showed him the symptoms that rise up after the Causticum 12CH

39
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:31,230
and he told her to take placebo for some time and to write to you the symptoms

40
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,330
and ask your opinion.

41
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:38,310
So she is asking, if it's so good the reaction, why she feels so bad?

42
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:52,780
After a few days I took for four days 30CH Causticum and then gradually the cramps

43
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,530
in the calf began to reduce and I could sleep much better and it was even difficult

44
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:01,210
to rise up in the morning, I slept very deep.

45
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:09,480
Also gradually the pain in the heart in the left side began to reduce.

46
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:16,200
After I felt I need to sleep much more than usual and the sleep was very deep

47
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:23,280
and I need to sleep also during day time. At that time I used to be involved with my

48
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:29,060
patients, especially the patients who come with a complaint that somebody abuses them

49
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,130
and then I used to shout, don't let them abuse you.

50
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:41,020
I was surprised for some of them was very useful. They felt much better.

51
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,510
-This is Homeopathy, sympathy.

52
00:06:53,770 --> 00:07:03,450
-After some time, after much long time of carrying many duties and working lots of hours

53
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:08,710
with patients, I felt that I will collapse because of so much of things that I have to carry

54
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:13,700
for long time and I couldn't bare it anymore, I felt that I will collapse

55
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:19,460
and I can't take anymore the stress which comes from different areas of life,

56
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,940
especially the stress that comes from duties and family relations.

57
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,690
So I took Nux vomica one time.

58
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:39,640
I thought it will fill me with more energy and it helped only for one week,

59
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:47,740
after one week I was much more going to relapse or stress or lack of energy.

60
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:56,270
-But she actually did a lot in her work, in her family?

61
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,640
-This is the time when she sent you the fax because she didn't know whether to continue

62
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,240
with the Causticum or not.

63
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:07,640
I felt most of the time withdrawn from social relations more and more.

64
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:17,140
Then I received from you a fax to take again the 30CH Causticum and I took only one dose

65
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,640
because I was afraid.

66
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:26,140
Then after the one dose of Causticum I developed acute flu with very high fever

67
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,390
and this is after two years without any flu or anything.

68
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:44,480
I had to go to home to rest because of the high fever and for my surprise after 48 hours

69
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,760
I came once more to my energy and I recovered very quickly and after two years I could

70
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:55,260
go once more to usual activities.

71
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:03,540
One week after the flu I felt a feeling as if I used to carry a very heavy bag on my back

72
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,540
and then suddenly the feeling was as if the bag is taken out of my bag.

73
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:15,540
Suddenly I feel so good and so light, I don't know how this feeling feels like and I walk

74
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:24,040
bend like this because the muscle of the bend did not how to feel free.

75
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:35,040
Seven years ago I used to have frequently very severe back pain which it came to a condition

76
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:40,010
that the doctor suggested operation. Then I took a dose of Lil. tigr. and since

77
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:44,260
then the back pain didn't come until this experience.

78
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:54,510
And after this experience of the very severe back pain, doctor gave me two weeks of vacation

79
00:09:54,610 --> 00:10:01,010
from the work but for my surprise after three days I recovered spontaneously and could go

80
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:05,860
to work with good energy, with the help of physiotherapy.

81
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:17,760
-I didn't follow very well what she said. She said after Causticum, she developed an acute

82
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:26,260
high fever for two days, after that she felt very good, the energy was good

83
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:34,610
and then she felt as if a weight was lifted and was out of her back.

84
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:58,520
-Suddenly, a week after the flu. I was in the evening very weak and I couldn't walk and

85
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:12,510
I went to lie in bed and after bed one night I woke up and I couldn't go out of bed,

86
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:18,510
I had to crawl and I go to the orthopedist.

87
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:24,760
He said me that it's a collapse of the muscle of the back.

88
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:28,560
All my muscles are not working.

89
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,600
-When it was that?

90
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:48,850
-One week after the acute. And the doctor gave me twelve days off to treat it.

91
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:52,350
-She is talking about now or in the past?

92
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:57,130
-After the severe acute that she recovered very good, one week after that she has

93
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:02,450
experienced of very severe pain and collapse of the muscles in the back.

94
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:10,200
-Now, not in the past.
-Now in March.

95
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:20,100
-And the doctor who saw here gave her 12 days vacation. But in 3 days she recovered.

96
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:34,600
-This pain was in the past, every year I have for 2 weeks, I have to lie down and year

97
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:52,950
after year until I was very sick and the orthopedist told me that I have to operate.

98
00:12:54,130 --> 00:13:00,030
-This was his diagnosis before?
-Seven years before.

99
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:18,700
-She said that after this recovery she felt very free as if a heavy load was lifted,

100
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,370
is that correct?

101
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:33,870
-Yes. I feel about five days after the flu, I feel very good and my feeling was that

102
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:41,780
somebody had all the time something very heavy on the back and they put it on and

103
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:55,530
I can't do what I want. And I felt after the acute that I feel very light, a heavy load was

104
00:13:55,630 --> 00:14:01,710
lifted; then I planned to do many things but then the back...

105
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,450
-Then it came the collapse?
-Yes.

106
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:20,710
-Now it's clear. Then she recovers from this collapse in the back, she came back

107
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,350
after the collapse...

108
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:30,710
-In the past it took her two weeks to recover, right now it took her three days to recover.

109
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:41,020
In April I felt very good feeling and I felt a lot of love to myself and I felt like changing

110
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,290
the hair style, need to buy for myself new things.

111
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:53,770
All the people around me at work told me that I look so different, that I look so good

112
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:58,770
and over here at the seminar also everybody is telling me that I look so different

113
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:04,530
and I look so new and good that even me, myself begin to believe in it.

114
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:16,020
Right now what is remaining is a pain on the left side at the spleen area.

115
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:24,020
This pain used to be when I was a medical student and the pain has no pattern.

116
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:31,120
It comes suddenly and I have to bend like this forward.

117
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,120
-Did she mention this pain last time?
-No.

118
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:55,110
-This pain when it was there last time? After Causticum she had this pain but I said

119
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:59,110
before the Causticum, when the pain was?

120
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:07,610
-When I was a medical student and I was 20 years old. The pain began when I was 20 and

121
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:14,610
continued for 20 years and it finished a few years ago but I don't remember exactly when.

122
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:22,560
-Now the pain is back and it's still there at this moment, correct?

123
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:34,360
-Yes. When I speak or when I'm excited I have itching in my throat and I can't speak.

124
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:46,350
After Causticum, I used to suffer from cold weather, right now I feel more warm.

125
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:51,850
In this kind of weather like now I used to wear a jacket, right now I don't need it.

126
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,630
-I would like about the memory.

127
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:07,030
She had mentioned about the memory that she was forgetting words.

128
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:18,180
-I tend to forget dates and words and when I speak about the past I don't recall

129
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,180
if it was in last Wednesday or last Tuesday.

130
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:35,630
When I was young, medical student, I used to be very shy, very timid and for a long time

131
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:43,930
I used to be alone because of that and right now once more I feel shy and I want to get

132
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:49,930
close to people, right now I do feel the need to get close to people but I feel shy again.

133
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:54,570
But before it didn't bother me, right now it is bothering me.

134
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:07,770
While taking the Causticum, the concentration of the mind is to a less degree.

135
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:14,120
Right now as well I need to do much effort to usual to concentrate.

136
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:17,010
-In her work?

137
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:23,780
-Everything which I'm doing, working or reading or even speaking with people.

138
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:30,340
I had it in the past but right now it's coming more strongly that while I'm speaking to someone,

139
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:35,940
suddenly I forget the word and I know the word but the word doesn't come up.

140
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,690
-This is what she has said. (?)

141
00:18:45,440 --> 00:19:01,590
Another thing is, she was mentioning fear of people, how is that?

142
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:14,190
-In the past I suffered emotionally from people a lot, I was hurt from people a lot

143
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:25,290
and right now when I want to open up and to get close to somebody, I feel immediately the pain

144
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:42,510
and I withdraw back. I fear to be hurt and with this as well I feel loneliness and right now

145
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:46,360
it's much more bothering me than in the past.

146
00:19:53,100 --> 00:20:00,830
-What about the injustice? How is this injustice feeling now, still there or it's reduced?

147
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:11,890
-Many things make me angry but since it's the past that was gone away, I feel good.

148
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:17,720
But I don't outburst.

149
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,040
-Cramps, how are they?

150
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:30,790
-In the last six months I had only two attacks from cramps where I had to wake up in the night

151
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:37,540
and walk for twenty minutes and the pain was much worse than the past attacks

152
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,040
but it was only two in the last six months.

153
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:47,680
Before Causticum I used to wake up almost every night because of the cramp and the pain.

154
00:20:50,930 --> 00:21:01,290
-Also she has said that she has fear of animals. She didn't notice if this continues.

155
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:08,390
-When I see a dog I have to go around to cross the street, even for a small dog.

156
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:25,790
-This cough which she had just now how long she has this?

157
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:30,290
-Before the Causticum because of the cigarettes I used to have every once for a while

158
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:36,740
coughing attack but after the Causticum, I don't remember in which potency it began,

159
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:52,210
it's quite a lot the coughing all the time, each day and not in a special situation.

160
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:57,320
Only if I speak or I'm excited.

161
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:04,650
-Also I don't remember we have noticed here stammering speech,

162
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,250
I don't notice now stammering.

163
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:34,750
-If I was excited or shy I used to repeat one word many times because I couldn't remember the word.

164
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:37,480
-And now she has this?

165
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:48,580
-No but I speak much less with people so I can't know.

166
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:55,020
-The finger nails also she said they are very strong.

167
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,090
-Yes, very strong.

168
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:10,520
-Still strong?

169
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:16,670
-Even the scissors are breaking because of the nails.

170
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:24,160
-And the sweets still she does not like them?
-Not very much.

171
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,400
-Salt?

172
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:34,900
-More. I didn't notice but other people noticed that I put a lot of salt and without this

173
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,650
large amount of salt I feel as if the food has no taste.

174
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:44,750
-So much?
-Yes, she needs to put much salt.

175
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:52,740
-Emotionally how she is now?

176
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:58,190
-My energy is very high and I want to get closer to people.

177
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:04,190
-But she has a lot of emotions? That means the emotions have started coming strong?

178
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:11,270
-In the beginning all this emotional channeled to my daughter and I was angry expressing

179
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:18,770
a lot of anger towards her but right now I even brought her with me here in Greece and

180
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:20,570
I have very good relationship now.

181
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:26,440
-She is a pediatrician. She sees only children or she sees cases?

182
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,940
-She is a family doctor and a homeopath, she has two clinics.

183
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:38,110
One as usual family doctor in the government hospital and one private clinic as homeopath.

184
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:41,610
-But she sees grown-ups or only children?

185
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:46,110
-In the morning only children, in the afternoon as a family doctor all kinds of people and

186
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:48,960
in the evening as homeopath in my home place.

187
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:55,660
-She works too much.
-I enjoy it.

188
00:24:56,410 --> 00:25:04,810
-You enjoy it? Do you feel more close to children or in your patients?

189
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:11,710
-To children. I can help more easily.

190
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:19,140
-How is this sympathetic element?

191
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:29,820
-I feel my patients, not all of them but I feel them and sometimes I'm asking questions

192
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:39,040
to my patients and even me I'm amazed that I know much more than they say.

193
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:51,540
-Does she have any time to take a nap in between? I want to know how she feels if she

194
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,290
takes a nap in the afternoon. How she wakes up.

195
00:25:55,390 --> 00:26:00,620
-I feel very bad if I sleep in the daytime taking a nap and my body intends to collect

196
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:11,820
electrical static, especially in my hair. If I touch my hair, the hair will stand.

197
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:32,370
I changed my haircut because otherwise they will stand because I feel my body has electricity

198
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:43,970
and I can't touch... When I examine children the child will jump because of the electricity.

199
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:56,120
-What she says about the hair happens if she has a nap in the afternoon?

200
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:05,120
-If I take a nap in the afternoon I feel very bad as if I'm not in the situation, it takes me

201
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:10,720
a long time to come back to myself and I feel generally bad.

202
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:21,220
-How many children she has?
-One and two grand children.

203
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,900
-Her husband, she is divorced?

204
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,970
-She didn't get along with his wife that's where she got divorced.

205
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:36,970
He got married with her best girlfriend.

206
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:56,400
-Can she now tell us if she suppressed her anger from time to time?

207
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:27,920
-Yes. I have to because if I explode on my work it's not good. The main issue that I'm

208
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:32,420
afraid to explode and to express my anger is the relationship with my mother.

209
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:41,450
She used to make a lot and very painful and bad things to me and right now I'm taking care of her

210
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:56,500
and it's something which is very difficult for me to stop the anger which is all the time.

211
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:03,750
My mother has somebody to take care of her which I'm paying for this and she does not

212
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:09,100
do nothing at all to support that thing.

213
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:22,750
-And that makes her very angry but she withholds herself. She does not say anything.

214
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:25,100
She lives with her mother?

215
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:31,750
-I took care of my father when he died and then I took my mother to my place because

216
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:39,600
of my mother I couldn't give children anymore, in the past.

217
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:55,750
After the first child while I was a student in the medical school, I got pregnant again

218
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:58,020
and my mother began to shout at me.

219
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:06,420
You don't need a child anymore, don't bring a child, you don't need it right now and

220
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:14,420
she called her doctor, the doctor lived in Romania and she called the doctor to her house

221
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:22,170
and the mother told her that she just wants to give her a shot just to calm her down and

222
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:32,350
the shot was anesthetic shot to make her do the abortion without she knowing about this.

223
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,750
And the abortion was on the kitchen table in her house.

224
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:44,750
The mother asked the doctor to twist the uterus so she wont' be able to get pregnant once more

225
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:52,110
and only when she took care of the father and the father died only then she discovered that thing.

226
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:59,750
When I came to Israel I did all sorts of things to get pregnant but I couldn't and I think this

227
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:03,370
is one of the reason why I divorced my husband.

228
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:12,880
Because I couldn't bear children anymore and I was very angry and I came to my mother

229
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:22,120
to ask her, why you did this to me, why you didn't tell my, why you killed my child.

230
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:33,630
I told her you are a killer, you are amurderer, why did you do it? And the mother replied,

231
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:38,620
I did it because if you have less children you'll have more time to treat me and this is what

232
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,070
is going on right now.

233
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:47,680
Right now she is taking care of the mother and because of this she has a lot of anger.

234
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:55,790
After taking the Causticum 3-4 times I decided to send my mother once more to Romania

235
00:31:55,890 --> 00:32:09,540
to elder house where people will take care of her but my consciousness doesn't allow me

236
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:16,490
to do it, I can't do it although she never really helped me to grow up, my grand mother

237
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:29,060
grew me but my mother never involved in my growth. This is part of my life.

238
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:37,540
The thing that I see her every day and I have to treat her and see her every day rise up in

239
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:43,640
me so much anger and emotions that I think I have to take every month the Causticum.

240
00:32:45,640 --> 00:33:00,540
-We'll take care of the anger. Reduce it. She will have a relapse if she stays like that.

241
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:16,540
-After taking the Causticum 30C, I felt to do things for myself and I didn't feel anymore

242
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:22,470
guilty to do things for myself and not to take care of my mother.

243
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:27,220
Always I had some kind of guilt, why do you take care of yourself, why don't you take

244
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,970
care of your mother?

245
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:34,220
And now I feel good with it. In my mind always there is the thinking that I want to kill her

246
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:39,270
and only because of this thought I'm afraid so much that I take care of her more and more.

247
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:44,770
Shall I tell you a secret, yes or no, I'm thinking? I'll tell you my experience,

248
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:57,770
it's an observation which happens with this type of Homeopathy, where you prescribe after

249
00:34:57,870 --> 00:34:59,650
studying the case.

250
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:18,010
There is a certain phenomenon that takes place that things seem to have a kind of a harmony

251
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:33,510
of another dimension, a kind of order which happens with the prescription of the remedies.

252
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:40,760
That means the person comes and gives you a story and gives you in information

253
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:43,260
and you prescribe correctly.

254
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:51,680
Next time he comes and gives you similar story but something deeper, something which reveals

255
00:35:51,780 --> 00:36:04,840
to you the deeper level and how things are unraveling and unblocking and lifted the heaviness,

256
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,690
as she described.

257
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:15,590
If she had given this story from the very beginning, what should we do?

258
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:22,110
And it was very interesting in the end I turn around and I say to Margaret, show me what

259
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:40,940
you have been putting and I would like to show you. It's very interesting.

260
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:54,530
The two remedies that stand out very prominently Causticum and Staphysagria.

261
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:13,860
So what shall we do in such a case?

262
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:34,360
Is now the time for Staphysagria or do we have to wait or do we have to give a higher Causticum?

263
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:50,150
There are some Causticum symptoms like aversion to sweets, desire salt.

264
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:06,900
What is the right thing to do in such a case? Where you have symptoms of the previous

265
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:18,150
remedy still but you have some symptoms of another remedy which is complementary to

266
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:19,750
the previous one.

267
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:34,900
In order to decide let's take a hypothetical situation where we let...

268
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:46,480
we say wait a few months, see what happens. We let this organism under this stress of

269
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:52,240
anger which is suppressed, where is it going to go?

270
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:59,230
Most probably is she going to have a relapse?

271
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:04,000
Most probably she is going to have a relapse and the relapse will be back in Causticum.

272
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:08,900
The cramps will start, the closeness.

273
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:23,400
What was the most dangerous symptom for her, if you remember, you got some person

274
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:37,240
who didn't care to live or die. Life was going away. Now she starts coming back to life

275
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:45,730
and the fact that she has so strong feelings against the mother are now strong feelings

276
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:51,080
but dangerous, dangerous to the point where they can bring about a relapse.

277
00:39:52,080 --> 00:40:00,310
Therefore if we have enough symptoms for Staphysagria, we have to prescribe Staphysagria

278
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:10,580
and most probably there is going to be another round which we will need again Causticum

279
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,410
and perhaps higher.

280
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:20,810
So this is the case where we say, Causticum and Staphysagria are complementary

281
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,830
and they may come around.

282
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:36,990
Causticum and Staphysagria a few times before she is unloaded with this experience which is

283
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:39,830
a terrifying experience of course.

284
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:54,230
Because I never had parents, so I felt so independent all the time and these things I hear

285
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:59,060
are beyond my comprehension, I don't understand because I don't understand the connection,

286
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:09,810
how a mother can have such an influence upon a child or do this or has the authority upon the child.

287
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:12,630
My mind can't follow because I don't have the experience.

288
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:19,080
I don't have the connection. I don't know, you have the connection? Your mother can do

289
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,900
such things to you, I don't know.

290
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:44,550
It's beyond logic and she said I did it in order that you take care of me in the old age,

291
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:46,900
calculating in such a way!

292
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:54,050
Making a murder and now she is in a position now where she will feel bad even if she sends her

293
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:57,350
to the house of the aged.

294
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:09,050
-I would like to make an observation that perhaps because the nature of the relapse that

295
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:15,550
another remedy of similar action perhaps being introduced and I'm thinking in terms of Nat. mur.

296
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:21,300
Because the hatred, the anger, there is similar action to Causticum.

297
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:27,800
There is this tremendous fear of dogs and all the ailments from the anger and the indignation,

298
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:35,050
the same as Staphysagria but now she also wants the company which not that it comes out in

299
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:43,050
first level but still comes out desire for company, aggravation for being alone, the need for salt

300
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:51,650
and this hate, the estrangement from family members, the aversion to certain persons and so on.

301
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:10,300
-Nat. mur. will not do anything, almost anything for this case because is we say what is

302
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:17,800
the main problem at this moment with this organism, is the suppression of anger.

303
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:22,800
So you have to take suppression of anger underline it 4 times and then take it into

304
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:34,300
consideration and then see what happens. Also she says, if I sleep in the afternoon

305
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:49,250
I get up very bad state, also another Staphysagria and you don't need further symptomatology

306
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:55,550
to go along and prescribe the complementary of Causticum which is

307
00:43:55,650 --> 00:44:03,140
Staphysagria. Staphysagria has to be given to reduce the anger, she will get Staphysagria,

308
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:14,140
not that she will forget but this type of anger which reaches almost the limits because she says,

309
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,990
I feel I could kill her.

310
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:30,470
This is the limit because you stay sane and you don't kill her. This is a limit situation

311
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:39,470
so we have to reduce this anger by Staphysagria. The problem is what potency?

312
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:43,320
Very high, medium or low?

313
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:50,090
-High.
-Low.

314
00:44:52,840 --> 00:45:26,560
-Let me see your opinion. 30? 200? 1M? 10M? 50M? CM? We leave it for later.

315
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:34,220
High, yes. 10M I think it's enough.

316
00:45:53,980 --> 00:46:05,970
It is very interesting also to observe how diseases are produced through these very deep traumas.

317
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:19,290
It was very interesting also for me the reaction she had to Causticum.

318
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:37,540
It is unusual. What is unusual? She takes the remedy and she has this acute, then she feels

319
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:51,040
extremely well, then the muscle collapse. So all the problem of the organism which

320
00:46:51,140 --> 00:47:07,790
leaves the emotional, goes to the body and paralyses the body and then fortunately

321
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:11,090
she will recover quickly.

322
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:33,040
You see also the confirmation of these observations which I have made all along

323
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:42,290
these years, every case almost will have to go through this type of confirmation before

324
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:44,640
you can say they change level.

325
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:52,540
Change level is a big thing in Homeopathy, between I feel better

326
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:58,140
and my symptoms are better and between I have this evolution.

327
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:06,890
Thank you very much.
