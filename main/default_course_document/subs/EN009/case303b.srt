1
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:31,720
-Now yesterday she came and she complained that she has started

2
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,680
with the diarrheas again and today the diarrhea continued.

3
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:46,520
So she came with her doctor friend who said to me something very remarkable.

4
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,750
She said yesterday when... you tell the story.

5
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:55,180
-Yesterday evening we went out for dinner and we went in a restaurant

6
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,850
and he drove me home and we came to our flat and she had closed the door,

7
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:05,250
suddenly she turns around, runs back to the car and checks

8
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:08,890
if she had really locked the door.

9
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:14,960
Since I observed it for the first time, nevertheless even though I know her for a long time,

10
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,620
I asked her if she does that several times, if she had been doing that before

11
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,030
and that she can tell you herself.

12
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:32,140
-I've done that before and sometimes I run back several times to double check

13
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,040
if I switched off the lights and if I put on the brakes.

14
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:46,990
-If she switches off the stove also?
-Yes, in the kitchen.

15
00:01:48,780 --> 00:02:03,380
-And immediately something connected and I asked her, the next question

16
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:08,900
that we put to her it was... This was outside.

17
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:18,930
The next question I asked her was whether she was sympathetic and the doctor friend, she said...

18
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:25,570
-She is extremely sensitive with our animals or with our friends or when I'm sick

19
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:32,830
just for a day, she would run over and ask me how my headaches are and she gets scared.

20
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:41,250
-But what you said actually was very, very, very sympathetic. Right?

21
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:48,580
After that answer and that little conversation, I said we missed important information.

22
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:58,300
That information is important and then the little girl said that she did not think

23
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:10,680
of speaking about these matters, especially double checking because her father is doing that

24
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,870
also all the time. Is that correct?

25
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,640
-Yes, that's true.

26
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,200
-Then the next question that we put to her is whether she is losing urine

27
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,910
while coughing and she replied...

28
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:41,470
-When I laugh. In former times it has been much more but still nowadays, a little bit.

29
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:57,550
-And then I asked her about sweets, whether she likes sweets. What was the answer?

30
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:04,290
-I do like sweets but I don't take them because my symptomatology aggravates.

31
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:10,750
-Two days after the remedy she developed some herpes on the tip of the nose

32
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:14,220
but she said she already had some of the side on the tip of the nose,

33
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,520
when she came to Alonissos.

34
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:29,040
-And thank you very much. You are lucky.

35
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,220
In your computers do you have the case? What did you get?

36
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:58,090
-Now Causticum.

37
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:03,030
-Who got Causticum? Everybody.

38
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,010
Very good.

39
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:27,320
I think we spoke about Causticum and this is my mistake that I did not investigate further

40
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:31,370
when she said, I get an eruption on the tip of the nose.

41
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:37,960
That should be enough to investigate more properly the possibility of Causticum.

42
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:43,140
But I'm tired and my mind is half working.

43
00:05:54,290 --> 00:06:03,380
She says the fourth day starts with diarrhea. What is this?

44
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:10,580
You can not say anything but the eruption comes in the tip of the nose.

45
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:19,220
That means the remedy just pushes us and gives us a sign. Causticum, this is the idea.

46
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:25,420
It's Causticum and then if you don't have your real mind, you lose the case.

47
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,820
Many times it happens like that.

48
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,810
You give the wrong remedy and push the right symptom, out.

49
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:51,320
That means you are a good/bad prescribed. You are close. That means I'm getting there.

50
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,270
I'm becoming good.

51
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:09,310
So what shall we do in this case? Forget Gelsemium. The fourth day? Yes the fourth day.

52
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:13,610
It does not matter. We give Causticum, she will take Causticum.

53
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:23,360
She will start with Causticum again with the same idea, 200 every day and see what happens.

54
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:28,260
Every day you have to watch. Where is the doctor?

55
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:36,470
You watch her in case she has a reaction, whatever.

56
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:49,510
That was a good demonstration of a bad omission.

57
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:05,270
I wanted to see this case because according to the reactions she is having,

58
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:16,180
we can decide to regulate from now on the cortisone enema.

59
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:27,900
It has to be noted also that since 10 days, she has stopped taking the cortisone orally

60
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:35,570
and I think it was recorded that she started having diarrhea

61
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:41,980
in the fifth or sixth day I think.

62
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:48,340
-She normally started to have diarrhea again when the cortisone went down to 5 mg.

63
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,210
-She started already by the time.

64
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:57,150
-And enema she took every day always.

65
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:02,990
-Now how many days she is taking the remedy?

66
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:08,970
-Since Thursday. it's a week.

67
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:18,370
-Can she tell us what happened after Causticum?

68
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:25,130
-The diarrhea stopped already the next day. It was gone completely

69
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:31,040
and I got an eczema in my face, especially in the morning and the evening

70
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:35,260
and it looks a little bit like very slight urticaria.

71
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:38,000
-In the face?

72
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,700
-The whole face, the forehead, the cheeks.

73
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:48,070
-Now she has a normal stool, formed?
-Yes.

74
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,460
-And how does she feel otherwise?

75
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,460
-Not changed, very normal all together.

76
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:09,820
-Because she was tired when we took her case, she says I'm always very tired.

77
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,560
How she feels now in this?

78
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,200
-That didn't change. I'm still tired.

79
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,610
-Is she taking Causticum every day?

80
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,270
-Yes three times.

81
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:24,200
-And also enema every day?
-Yes.

82
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:35,710
-And she is having the kind of the stool that she had before with the cortisone

83
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:39,160
or it is more formed,

84
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:43,460
less formed?
-The same.

85
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:51,770
-How many mg of cortisone is in the enema?

86
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:57,390
-It should be written on the box, so we can find out.

87
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:12,030
-OK, she can start reducing the enema, from half and every day a little bit more,

88
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:19,290
until in 10 days she will have no enemas and then we can observe while at the same time

89
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:23,120
she continues to take the Causticum.

90
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:31,250
In case there is a relapse while she is taking the Causticum, then you go to 1M

91
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:40,470
and you give every day for more than 10 days, depending on the reaction.

92
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:44,600
Psychologically she doesn't feel any different?

93
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:50,490
She is still checking all the time?
-Yes.

94
00:11:52,390 --> 00:12:01,360
-And she had an eruption on the tip of the nose and that was gone after Causticum?

95
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:05,870
-Yes.
-OK, thank you.
