1
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:31,320
-He was in the hospital.
-Does he ask for water?

2
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:41,170
-No and he refuses it while I put a straw in his mouth.

3
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,910
-But he does not want to drink.

4
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:00,500
-Not really. Sometimes he is eager but very seldom.

5
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:12,060
-What changes have you observed in his character, in the way he contacts others?

6
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,320
He was a very lively child or he always was like that?

7
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:25,470
-It's a confusing question because he is not just one way all the time.

8
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:31,800
Sometimes he is very lively and very excited about everything and then other times

9
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:39,050
he is very mobby, when he is upset about something he doesn't want to talk about it

10
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,630
and goes away.

11
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:50,480
-He was always able to answer his own questions, which is unusual for a child.

12
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:04,310
Here I know the remedy. You will see the remedy later on.

13
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:11,230
What is my analysis now in this case? What do I observe?

14
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:18,050
I observe a child that is too serious for his age.

15
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,640
Either he is suffering too much, has some kind of pains that he has not.

16
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:35,380
He does not complain of pains but he is too serious, too sad, depressed

17
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:42,060
and the child for me, as I observe, he has a depression.

18
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:56,130
What I ask the mother is to see whether my observation tallies with her observation.

19
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,150
That's not the picture of a child, right?

20
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:10,980
So the mother gives me the answer. What did she say, do you remember?

21
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:21,380
The mother says this confuses me because sometimes the child is elated,

22
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,900
sometimes it is depressed.

23
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,520
-Is he afraid of anything?
-Yes.

24
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,880
-Very much?
-Yes.

25
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,800
-What is he afraid of?

26
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:47,380
-Maybe being by himself, being abandoned, being left alone.

27
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,880
-So he wants somebody next to him.
-Yes.

28
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,140
-All the time.

29
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:59,310
You see it is very misleading.

30
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:14,800
The mother says that the child is afraid. There is the hydration and there is fear,

31
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:25,790
the child can not stay alone. It wants the mother next to him.

32
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,730
What's the remedy?
Phosphorus.

33
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,240
-To hold his hand?
-No.

34
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:47,300
I'm moving around in the room and then I sit down and maybe I hold his hand and

35
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,710
massaging his body.

36
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,310
-And she likes that?
-Yes that seems to bringing him out.

37
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,960
Another symptom of Phosphorus, massaging his body. Phosphorus he likes it.

38
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:09,630
I'd like to see more the interpretation. How you can go one way or another

39
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:16,740
and how the differential diagnosis becomes unless you go to the heart of the matter.

40
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:30,880
What the mother said for my mind in order to differentiate...

41
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:36,050
She says something which is contrary to Phosphorus.

42
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:41,210
I said, does he want you to hold his hand?

43
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:49,900
She said, no actually I can be just around in the room and then eventually I can go and hold him.

44
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,980
That's not exactly typical of Phosphorus.

45
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:06,350
The Phosphorus would like the contact, would like the security of the mother all the time.

46
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:11,150
Phosphorus in such a state.

47
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:18,300
-He sits like that, he doesn't respond very much, he sits very quiet.

48
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,350
Is that usual?
-Yes.

49
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:29,600
-That's not his character, he didn't use to be so quiet like an angel.

50
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:43,890
Jacob, how old are you, do you know?
-Six and a half.

51
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:51,560
-Can you lift him up to see how he responds?

52
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:57,150
-I will lift you up. Maybe sit up. Can you help me?

53
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,560
Can you sit by yourself?

54
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:22,310
-Do you feel tired Jacob? Do you want to lie down?

55
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:35,240
Just put him around and let him sit or take him in your lap sitting.

56
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:58,320
Did you try to test his strength?
-Yes. Oh, he is strong.

57
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:09,510
-He is making jerking movements all over.
-Give me your hand, give me the other hand.

58
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:53,870
Was anything happening in your house that he might have been in grief?

59
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:07,620
You see what is the characteristic of this child in general? It is sorrow, it is sadness.

60
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:15,440
That becomes the main characteristic of the child. The sorrow of that child.

61
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,450
Can you see his face? This is the face of a child?

62
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:28,210
That's the face of somebody who is really suffering, he is in deep depression.

63
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,860
So when I see that I want to know why he is in that state.

64
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:43,270
Is that because of the disease? Is it characteristic of the disease to be on that state?

65
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,480
What has happened? I would like to know.

66
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:50,940
Why I would like to know about this particular aspect in this case?

67
00:09:51,040 --> 00:10:01,520
Because I see it very prominent. The main characteristic of the child is grief, sadness.

68
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,050
Something must have happened?

69
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:09,620
What can happen in the life of a child of such age?

70
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:22,960
Do you have to be magician to find that?
-Parents.

71
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,520
-A conflict.

72
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:31,440
-The parents most probably are divorced. That is the first idea.

73
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:40,770
Things are going on in my mind, I start thinking. Is that a case of Phosphorus?

74
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:45,570
It doesn't look like because he is too depressed.

75
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:50,570
Then she is giving me symptoms of Phosphorus but the child is too depressed to be Phosphorus

76
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,150
What has happened?

77
00:10:52,250 --> 00:11:10,080
This is the side effect of chicken pox? Is this mental state because of the chicken pox? No.

78
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:17,400
What has happened? Most probably the parents are separated and he is very sad

79
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,830
because of that fact.

80
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:27,320
The idea that comes to my mind is what is happening with the child is that the child

81
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:36,150
must have felt tremendously insecure by losing one of them and that has brought about

82
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,490
a tremendous grief of the child.

83
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:46,900
The grief must have brought a state in which the child got the epidemic, the chicken pox.

84
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:55,400
The chicken pox found an organism that was under grief, very low and progressed to

85
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,670
the cerebellum.

86
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:04,820
And then he goes to the hospital and they said it is an inflammation of the cerebellum

87
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:13,560
after chicken pox. What can you do? We can do nothing. Just take your child.

88
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:17,410
They just wanted to get rid of the child and said we don't know.

89
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:25,810
Maybe he will come back again, maybe he will stay for the rest of his life

90
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:32,330
in semi-paralytic state but most probably something will stay with him for life.

91
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,750
Listen the story, it is very interesting.

92
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:45,400
-Did he watch you or your husband fighting in front of him?

93
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:56,990
-I think there is lots of talk, that's what I'm sensing, that Jacob overhears this talk

94
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:04,480
between his father and the house I'm in and the people that are in the house

95
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:20,680
and the little girl that stays there. She is difficult to be with, so there is lots of talk.

96
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,980
-Do you want to lie down sweet heart?

97
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:28,360
-What do you feel Jacob?

98
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:34,310
As the mother talks, I observe the child. Have you observed?

99
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:38,600
Do you see as she talks about that subject, how the grief in the child becomes

100
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:45,500
deeper and deeper and deeper? And then she can't stand it anymore.

101
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:54,150
He will become aggressive. I want to see the reaction, so I don't allow him to lie down,

102
00:13:54,250 --> 00:14:01,500
because he feels better lying down. I want to continue and to observe what is happening.

103
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:06,100
I want to find out, otherwise you can't help the child.

104
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:11,560
Causticum was given and Carbo Vegetabilis, the whole of Materia Medica can be given

105
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:16,070
without any effect. Do you think it has an effect? No.

106
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:19,900
It says I'm a little bit better, a little bit better, the child can go on for months

107
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,340
and for years a little bit better but still on a paralytic state.

108
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:32,150
What he says? Do you want to lie down?
-Yes.

109
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:37,900
-Why Jacob? What do you feel?
-I feel bad.

110
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:52,830
-What? You feel nausea? You want to vomit?
-No.

111
00:14:54,170 --> 00:15:03,100
-Why you want to lie down?
-It feels good...

112
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,830
-If you lie down...

113
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:24,350
-Jacob were you upset about something?

114
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:35,170
You remember if you had something that made you upset last week?

115
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,660
-No.

116
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:46,250
-Are you telling the truth? Why don't you look at me?

117
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:53,820
-I don't want to.

118
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:04,860
-You don't want why? If you are saying the truth why you don't look at me?

119
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:10,180
-I don't want to.

120
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:21,440
-But why you are so sad? Something made you very sad.

121
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Do you understand my question? What made you so sad?

122
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,520
-Nothing.

123
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:44,420
-I think to answer to your question his father and I aren't together as man and wife

124
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:57,170
and I sense that that has upset Jacob and I opened that up to his father

125
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:04,360
in the last couple of days because he has been so much in the space...

126
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:23,830
-You were very upset during that period, last month or two?

127
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,250
-Yes.

128
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:36,670
-Especially upset?
-Yes and when it declared, his father and I had ...

129
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:40,510
Why do I enquire about the last period of two months?

130
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:43,690
When he fell ill with the chicken pox...

131
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:49,920
The child seems to have a problem because the parents are in not good terms,

132
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,250
they don't stay together etc.

133
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:59,760
But what I feel is that two months ago, just before falling sick with the chicken pox,

134
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:05,510
the child must have had another shock to bring down his system.

135
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:09,520
This condition can not come just like that.

136
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:29,670
-His father and I had to define our relationship so that it would be clear for me

137
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:36,590
and then for Jacob so we can live our lives according to some truth,

138
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:45,920
rather than being fuzzy out of our lives and we function as a couple a lot of times

139
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:54,020
but there is so much unset between us that lives everything unresolved all the time.

140
00:18:55,190 --> 00:19:12,970
And I'm aware that I want it resolved, I want it change and he doesn't like it. There it is.

141
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:25,010
-What you say is already a known thing for Jacob, he knows already?

142
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:28,590
-I think so, yes.

143
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:31,420
-And you are very connected? He is attached to you?

144
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:45,270
-Yes and he is very attached to his father. We are both very close to him, very special to him

145
00:19:46,300 --> 00:20:04,010
and he to us and we are operating in terms of "we" except not all the time

146
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:13,610
and it is confusing to me.
-I see.

147
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:27,710
Was Jacob's mood before changing quite a lot? It was very changeable his mood?

148
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:45,630
-Yes when something was disturbing him and also I've been assisted by a welfare program

149
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:51,460
for the last, since a year after he was born.

150
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:57,880
And I quit work just after he was born and I made it out to be with him

151
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:03,380
for at least 3 years and finally I'm going back to work.

152
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,470
-When?
-A month ago.

153
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:20,210
-Wait a moment? When did he fall sick?
-Maybe two weeks.

154
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:32,720
-That is already 14 days and one month ago you decided to go to work and you left him?

155
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:36,350
-I didn't leave him.

156
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,800
-Did you discuss it?
-Yes.

157
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,910
-You told him that you are going to go to work?

158
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:52,320
-Yes and that I was going to do it gradually and he would be staying with Jo

159
00:21:52,420 --> 00:22:00,160
and he goes to school for those 2 days anyway and he lives at Jo and then Wednesday and

160
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:09,910
Friday he would be staying at school, during school and then till evening

161
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:18,570
and Jo would pick him up and I was going to be busy, I was going to work

162
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:23,670
so I can make my own living and that 's a big thing.

163
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:32,570
-You discussed it?
-I told him, not that we had a discussion.

164
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:38,740
-When you told him that this is going to happen, he never reacted, never said anything,

165
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,990
he never complained?
-Right.

166
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,500
Do you hear the story?

167
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:51,650
One month ago the mother tells the child, now I'm going to leave you, I'm going to work,

168
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:55,990
you are a grown up, you are going to stay sometimes with your father, sometimes with me,

169
00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:04,490
we are going to discuss now as grown ups and all this American way of putting things,

170
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:06,930
business like...

171
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:19,500
But the child is in a state, he is not well and what happens is that the child gets a shock,

172
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:30,420
gets a grief and the grief is a silent grief, he hears the mother but he does not respond.

173
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,430
That is what has happened?

174
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:54,340
-He was not been able to sleep in the night or something like that?

175
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,740
-Just a couple of weeks I would say.

176
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:09,090
-Did he have a good appetite before?

177
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:24,020
-There was some fluctuation with his appetite and I would say it was a big issue at 3 years old,

178
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:32,940
not knowing what to give him, giving the wrong thing, vomiting...

179
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:39,510
-What does he like? Does he ask for something?

180
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:44,580
-I think he asked for cereals?

181
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:49,860
-Can anybody tell me what information I'm looking for now?

182
00:24:54,860 --> 00:25:00,610
My main drive is whether the child eats fruits or not?

183
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:06,180
That is going to become very important. Why?

184
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:13,510
Because so far information I have is that the child is in grief but it is silent grief.

185
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:20,110
If you look in your Repertory you will see the remedy, that the child's mood is changeable.

186
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:32,010
Changeable mood, silent grief and what she says is that he has convulsions if he is sitting.

187
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:40,940
Look in your Repertory convulsions sitting, can anybody tell me what are the remedies there?

188
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:59,280
-Ignatia, Nat. muriaticum, Pulsatilla.

189
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:15,940
-Where did you see convulsion in generalities or in extremities, when sitting?

190
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:37,440
Extremities, convulsions, generalities? Not sitting, it's not there.

191
00:26:45,160 --> 00:27:00,930
Ignatia has this kind of situation where you try to sit, there is this kind of convulsions

192
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:09,420
or choreic movements, involuntary movements while sitting, Ignatia and Cuprum

193
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,030
are the main remedies for this kind of state of affairs.

194
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:31,370
-Chorea after grief.
-Chorea after grief, Ignatia.

195
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:57,090
-Chorea lying on the back ameliorates while sitting is aggravating. Very good.

196
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:00,220
You see the child how he likes to lie down?

197
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:21,940
Give a little bit more information.
-I think he asks for cheerios.

198
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:31,940
-What else?

199
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:49,340
-This morning he said what is peanut butter and later he goes what about peanut butter?

200
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,940
Can I eat peanut butter?

201
00:28:54,980 --> 00:29:01,730
-Did he use to eat a lot of fruits before?
-Not a lot.

202
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:07,940
-Does he like fruits in general?
-Not really, I haven't been able to eat much fruit.

203
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:15,030
Did you see aversion to fruit? Ignatia is one of the main remedies?

204
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:26,920
You see the child how it stays in a silent grief? That is in our books silent grief.

205
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:30,690
What you see there that is silent grief.

206
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:39,620
When I try to describe I say words, now this is what it happens.

207
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:46,420
The child did not react, silent, he took the grief inside, he did not react.

208
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:54,680
This is the way that Ignatia and Nat muriaticum children will react

209
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:59,280
but why don't we go to Pulsatilla?

210
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:16,390
Because the Ignatia has exactly that symptom that the child has. Wants to lie down,

211
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:23,310
sitting has an aggravation and Ignatia together with Cuprum, there are two remedies only

212
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:33,820
that have this condition. Not only that but that face in the child...

213
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:43,410
If the child was Pulsatilla, what he would do? He would cry.

214
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:50,250
The same thing sad but ....

215
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:58,820
He would hold his mother but what he does now, he stays like that, immovable

216
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:07,400
with all this grief inside him. So much grief, so much grief, is it not impressive?

217
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:22,230
-Can you say that there is a period where he stopped eating fruits from that period on?

218
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:25,750
Can you define such a period?

219
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:40,400
-Sometimes when we moved into this house that we are in.

220
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,980
-That new house that you are living now?
-Yes.

221
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,800
-That means from that moment you didn't not live together in the same house...

222
00:31:55,180 --> 00:32:01,500
Do you see what happened? The child was taken by the mother in another house

223
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:06,330
where they are staying now and as soon as it was taking in the house,

224
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:12,850
the child stopped eating fruits. It's not stopped eating fruits, it went into an Ignatia state.

225
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:22,600
The child is in an Ignatia state since one and a half year. That is now the diagnosis.

226
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:31,950
The diagnosis for this child is Ignatia 10M. That is what he needs.

227
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:38,070
You will say in a case of inflammation of the cerebellum? Yes, it doesn't matter

228
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:45,160
what it is the picture. That picture is Ignatia. I don't care about the diagnosis.

229
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:52,240
They gave Causticum, they will give Cuprum, they will give all kind of local remedies

230
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:59,180
trying to cure the child. The child will never be cured by these remedies.

231
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:05,510
It is one remedy only and that is Ignatia, you can't replace that.

232
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:13,080
Causticum also is worse grief, why not Causticum and also Causticum has the paralysis,

233
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:17,840
has the pathology and does nothing for the child.

234
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:29,910
I took the case, I went inside to the class, now I analyze in front of you and you see Ignatia.

235
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:37,750
I went inside the class and they argued, nobody thought of Ignatia.

236
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:45,680
But anyhow the child was given Ignatia and I asked to see the child two days later.

237
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:54,690
This child is not eating. You can't just wait. How long you are going to wait?

238
00:33:54,790 --> 00:34:02,590
He can not keep anything inside. The first thing you have to see in that child

239
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:07,330
is that he starts eating, you can not wait anymore.

240
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:12,900
He is dehydrated, he is not eating, he does not keep liquids, he has to be hospitalized

241
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
just to give him some saline.

242
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:19,930
That's why I asked to see the child 48 hours later.

243
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,930
-How he is?
-Eating.

244
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:52,340
-He is much better?
-Oh, much better.

245
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:12,180
-Did he start eating the same amount?
-Yes, a little bit. We started slow.

246
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:16,340
-His appetite returned?
-Yes.

247
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:20,500
You see in video they will never give you the real story.

248
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:27,250
The real story is that the  practitioner who was giving the case

249
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:33,750
I telephoned to tell me how the child is.

250
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:44,180
I was worried, Ignatia, Ignatia but you want to see the result before you see the Ignatia.

251
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:51,160
So the first thing I would expect in such a case is that immediately

252
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:56,250
the child would start eating. He took the remedy, within one hour the child must start eating.

253
00:35:56,350 --> 00:36:02,090
So I asked the practitioner, I said you telephone in the night to see what happened.

254
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:10,830
The mother said his appetite is so great that we can not... I'm afraid to give him,

255
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:13,500
he is asking for everything.

256
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:21,490
She says we started him slowly, I'm afraid he was not eating for so many days and

257
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:26,250
suddenly asks for everything, shall I give him everything?

258
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:31,420
He may be upset in his stomach but his appetite is immediately better and his mother

259
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,740
is trying to monitor his diet.

260
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:42,670
This organism he knows what he wants, whether he can keep food inside,

261
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:46,500
his mother is not going to tell him whether he can keep food or not,

262
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:51,680
neither before his mother could make him eat anything.

263
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,170
-That was on Saturday.

264
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:03,850
Friday he took the remedy.

265
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:21,950
-How he went?
-I'm worried. Saturday he eats all day.

266
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,260
-The food didn't vomit at all?

267
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:37,360
-No and no upset stomach and he was pleased, very pleased.

268
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:48,540
He was talking about spaghetti and meat balls. I said not yet.

269
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:57,040
-When did he get up and started walking?

270
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:07,100
-On Saturday he wanted to move into the wheel chair, so we put him in the wheel chair

271
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:12,170
and then he started moving the wheel chair around, so he started having

272
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:21,470
good sense of control with that and then in that evening

273
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:26,600
he wanted to get out of the wheel chair into his bed

274
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:30,700
and then he would crawl out the wheel chair himself.

275
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:38,450
-That is 24 hours later.
-Yes.

276
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:56,450
The next interview is about 2-3 weeks later.

277
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:12,580
It is a pity that we did not have the follow up with the Anthracinum.

278
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:39,040
Here where the diagnosis was based, what I wanted to tell you, if my observation was not there,

279
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:48,350
it would be definite either Phosphorus or Cuprum because he had the spasms or the paralysis

280
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:52,030
or any other remedy except of Ignatia.

281
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:56,320
What brought out the Ignatia state was the observation.

282
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:04,220
What I have learned to look is to look on the person. I do not hear words,

283
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:11,030
I also observe who is in front of me, what he is doing, that is very important.

284
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:20,220
And that what I'm trying to give in the lectures. But it is so difficult to describe

285
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:30,400
with words what I see. Can you forget this state of grief that this child was?

286
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,480
-And he walked a bit?

287
00:41:49,580 --> 00:42:06,840
-He walked with help. He stood up and feeling I can stand up.

288
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:16,420
-How do you feel Jacob?
-Good.

289
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:22,580
-You are happy now?
-Yes.

290
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,480
-Do you remember how you were before?
-Yes.

291
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:34,340
-How? Can you describe?
-Sad.

292
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:41,750
-Do you know now why you were sad? You don't know.

293
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:50,660
Now you have a good appetite?
-Yes.

294
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:56,100
-What you would like to eat now?
-Everything.

295
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:03,590
-What about ice cream?
-Yes.

296
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:09,920
-What about sweets?
-Yes.

297
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:40,250
-What about fruits? Do you like fruits now?
-Protein in yogurt.

298
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:46,740
-Has he been able to run at all so far?
-Yes.

299
00:43:46,840 --> 00:44:00,920
He runs to the kitchen. Like a little person would run.

300
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:16,660
There is a little friend of him who is one year old. With her he started to walk.

301
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:33,650
-Tell me something Jacob. Do you remember seeing any dream?

302
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:36,920
-Yes.

303
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:45,340
-Do you remember the dream?
-It's about that tooth that came out.

304
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:09,900
-Did he go out to play at all or he stayed in the house so far?

305
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:16,150
-He wanted to play where his father lives in the country.

306
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:23,420
I don't know did you go out and play?
-Yes, near the manor.

307
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:36,500
-There is a big house and there is a big eucalyptus tree.

308
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:47,510
-Do you like salty things? Sweets you like.

309
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:55,590
What about meat, fish? You like.

310
00:45:56,590 --> 00:46:01,750
How is your thirst? Are you thirsty? You drink a lot?
-No.

311
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:06,670
-He doesn't want to drink anything.

312
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:19,840
-Let me see your tongue Jacob.

313
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:36,170
How is his mood?
-Sweet, precious.

314
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:44,000
-He was not so sweet before? Before he fell ill I mean.

315
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:54,340
-Just before he get the chicken pox he was irritable.

316
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:04,410
-Otherwise before he had the same sweetness?
-Sweet and then moody.

317
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:14,750
-How is now these 4 days, he is moody still or he seems to be...?

318
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:28,490
-He seems getting tired very quickly and he will be high spirited and then

319
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:38,320
he just gets very tired. It seems that he has an association with my niece,

320
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:49,460
he is doing something new with his hands and then he get tired.

321
00:47:52,830 --> 00:47:56,840
-These 4 days also you noticed this pattern?
-Yes.

322
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:03,400
-Is he perspiring at all?
-No.

323
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:09,010
-In bed he is not perspiring?
-No.

324
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:27,170
-Is any time that you noticed he feels worse or he feels better?

325
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:36,340
-It seems he is doing great in the morning when he wakes up but he has always been like that.

326
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:44,490
What I was trying to do is to see whether any remedy is coming up?

327
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:52,990
Not that I would give the remedy but just to advice the practitioner in case

328
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:56,150
that the child needed a complementary.

329
00:48:56,250 --> 00:49:01,570
As you see I was trying to differentiate between Nat muriaticum or Calcarea or Sepia

330
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:07,000
or whatever it might be the next remedy.

331
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:16,740
15 days later I saw the child, the child was so happy and so well that there was no question

332
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:19,400
of any remedy more.

333
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:26,400
Still here you may still see because this is the 4th day after the remedy,

334
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:30,820
you may still see some kind of sadness.

335
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:37,340
In the next follow up sadness has completely gone, he has never been so happy

336
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:44,750
and you see a happy child, a very healthy child. Thank you very much.
