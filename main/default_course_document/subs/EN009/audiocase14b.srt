1
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,920
-Did you put a bottle?

2
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:32,920
-I put a bottle to get my feet warm. I can't bear them too hot either.

3
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,670
-Then you push them out of the bed?

4
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,010
-No my feet are in.

5
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:45,270
You see in spite of the fact I have a rejected Calcarea carbonica,

6
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:55,290
she is putting a hot water bottle and then she says I can't bear them too hot.

7
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,440
Because I know in Calcarea carbonica the circulatory system is not easily regulated.

8
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,430
Slow to send the blood and keeps the cold, once it starts sending the blood,

9
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:15,430
then it becomes too hot and then Calcarea carbonica has to stick her feet out of covers.

10
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:19,540
That's why Calc carbonica also sticks her feet out of covers.

11
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:30,040
Now I turn to Calcarea carbonica and I enquire, do you stick your feet out? She said no.

12
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,760
If you are careful enough, the questions and the answers are coming to confirm

13
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:46,870
or disconfirm the right remedy, as long as you let yourself being open and don't judge.

14
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:56,100
Don't jump into conclusions because anybody could have jump into conclusions long time ago

15
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,180
and say this is Calcarea.

16
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:07,290
Fear of mice, worse cold, cold feet. Finished, take Calcarea carbonica. Nothing.

17
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,530
She would be very disappointed.

18
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:22,200
-With your work you are very fastidious?
-Yes.

19
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,100
-Cleaning the house?

20
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:31,600
-Yes I like to clean the bathroom and kitchen has to be clean.

21
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:37,280
For the sake of the students she says she is so tired, she feels so tired

22
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:46,200
because this is Arsenicum case and she is thirsty, she drinks cold drinks, she is tired.

23
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:55,330
This is Arsenicum case. So I enquire are you fastidious? How much this, how much that?

24
00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:03,280
For the sake of differential diagnosis to find out that she is not fastidious,

25
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,450
she is not the Arsenicum type.

26
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,200
-Do you like things in order, put them straight?

27
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:21,300
-Not very much of it. I wouldn't have anything dusty.

28
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:56,630
-Do you have salivation during sleep?
-Not now, I used to have in the autumn.

29
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,380
When I sweat it's not that awful smell.

30
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,810
-It used to be offensive?
-Yes very.

31
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,060
-What kind?

32
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:30,510
-To me it was ahorrible smell. Now when I get hot... I get suddenly very hot.

33
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:34,250
-Your energy is more than when you go to...

34
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:46,320
-Yes, I'm depressed and frustrated now because I realize I can get better

35
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:59,260
and I'm upset I want to get my hearing, I know it's there and I can hear beautifully.

36
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:06,010
-Can you hear sometimes?
-Yes I have 1/3 of my hearing.

37
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,750
-But it's gone?

38
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:19,670
-It's not very clear and then in the hospital put it...  and then my hearing is back.

39
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:43,080
Is anybody who wants to ask a question? Are you thinking about a specific remedy,

40
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,180
so you would like to ask a specific question?

41
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,380
I don't ask yet specific question, I could have made it more clear.

42
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,650
Once you hear my question, you will understand the remedy.

43
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:01,400
-Metallic taste?
-No, she does not have.

44
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:12,210
-Does she have a small limit where she could be warm or cold?

45
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,140
-No.

46
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:22,150
-Polypus anywhere?
-No.

47
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,140
-Warts?
-No.

48
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:41,400
Now it's very difficult, I know but I will give you a few hints.

49
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,300
You will look a little bit in your Repertory and you will tell me the remedy

50
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,800
but don't think that the remedy is clear. Do you agree that the remedy is not clear?

51
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,650
Is it clear the remedy?

52
00:06:54,650 --> 00:07:03,390
Anybody who says that it is clear remedy, can anybody says that in the class? No.

53
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:13,800
Don't tell me afterwards it's clear. It's not clear. The remedy is not clear.

54
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,050
There are some indications about the remedy.

55
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:27,550
Ask yourself now what is the remedy that has affections of the chest

56
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:35,970
and the ear primarily? The hearing?

57
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:44,970
Which has an aversion to salt and also an aversion to sweets that the practitioner

58
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,310
has mentioned in the very beginning.

59
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:54,550
Go in your Repertory and tell me if you can give me an indication of

60
00:07:54,650 --> 00:08:05,550
what is the remedy that has aversion to salt, aversion to sweets and then tell me

61
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:13,040
if there is a remedy involved there, which affects both the lungs and the hearing?

62
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,460
Cold as well.

63
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:23,420
It may be a thirsty remedy also. Look extreme thirst to see if this remedy is there.

64
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,780
Look desires cold drinks to see if this remedy is there.

65
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:37,020
The remedy that you have thought by these hints...

66
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:48,180
Did you look aversion to salt, aversion to sweets, a cold remedy that affects the ears,

67
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:56,760
affects the lungs, has thirst for cold drinks and has worse cold?

68
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:00,610
Did you look and you did not find the remedy?

69
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:14,070
What is the remedy? Say all together those who are feeling sure about the remedy,

70
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,650
say it all together.

71
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:18,460
-Graphites.

72
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,370
-Very good, very good. You are excellent homeopaths now.

73
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:36,770
If you were thinking Graphites but you are not sure because we selected certain of the symptoms

74
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:41,600
of the patient and put them together. We are not absolutely sure.

75
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:50,200
We like to be sure. What is the question that you would like to ask?

76
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:58,710
-If the practitioner was right, she would say desire fish.

77
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:04,850
-That is one question that I asked and she did not confirm it already.

78
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:11,620
When I tried to confirm desire for fish, she didn't really seemed to have a desire for fish.

79
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,410
-Does she have an eczema?

80
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:26,070
-Whether she has an eczema. The whole thing started after skin eruption.

81
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:33,390
Suppressed skin eruption it can give problem with Graphites, that is correct.

82
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:37,800
-Her reaction to music?

83
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:41,300
-Whether she likes music or whether she cries when she hears music?

84
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,550
It's not a reaction to music.

85
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:52,730
Graphites feels melancholy when they hear music and it brings on crying.

86
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,490
-Is she constipated?

87
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:06,900
-Constipation is not a keynote. You would like to hear a keynote of Graphites?

88
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:16,040
-Does she have cracks?

89
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:27,800
-She hears better when it is noisy?

90
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:42,040
-See that in your Repertory, find this hearing better and tell me if this is a keynote of Graphites.

91
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:14,530
Page 323, did you see it? It's not intuition.

92
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:25,290
Like when you play chess, you have one possibility with the best.

93
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:30,940
You have one move which is the best, if you don't make it, you lost.

94
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:40,700
This is Homeopathy. We have one move to make and it has to be the correct.

95
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:49,600
Because the hearing is impaired in this case and because you know

96
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:54,090
that the keynote of Graphites is hearing better when there is noise,

97
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:59,610
the hearing becomes better, you will have to ask this question the patient.

98
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:14,860
And if she says yes in this case, this case becomes Graphites, not Phosphorus, not...

99
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:29,110
But it is not clear, do you agree? Don't tell me now it is a clear cut case. No.

100
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,600
There are indications about Graphites.

101
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,510
-Is it both ears the same or worse the right side?

102
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:25,360
-Worse right side. Yes, I think...

103
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:34,440
-When she was three she had a mastoid infection, she didn't have antibiotics then.

104
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,190
Swelling...

105
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:53,360
-That's why I lost hearing but I wasn't aware of being deaf then.

106
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:27,520
So therefore this is not a loquacious patient. If this was a Lachesis case,

107
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:32,010
she would not have stopped. I look in the Repertory or I pretend I don't look there.

108
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:37,340
A Lachesis person will not stop talking. Never mind whether you listen or you don't listen,

109
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,860
Lachesis has to talk, therefore she is not loquacious.

110
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,420
And I remember I asked her specifically, she said sometimes I can be loquacious,

111
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:54,440
sometimes I'm not. And the interview does not bring out loquacity.

112
00:15:54,540 --> 00:16:00,420
Some of you noticed loquacity in the beginning; it appeared to be a little bit loquacious but no.

113
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:09,930
Loquacity always is when the person talks almost without caring whether anybody is hearing

114
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:14,530
and also talking in different subjects.

115
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:25,030
Then it becomes loquacity, an urge to talk.

116
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,280
She is not volunteering any answers.

117
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:56,450
I give her the chance to talk if something comes to her mind.

118
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:06,850
Sometimes it is very interesting and very important when after a pause,

119
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:12,700
the person himself comes out with an answer without a direct question.

120
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,100
-From high places you have vertigo?

121
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:44,940
-No, I get noise in the ears. But when I'm occupied, I forget.

122
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:50,390
-Is there any other condition when the hearing is better?

123
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:55,740
-When I'm very relaxed. It'd been better the last few months.

124
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:08,340
If I'm relaxed I can hear well but I can hear very well in the noise.

125
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:20,330
You see first I go around the ears, I brought her attention around the ears.

126
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:32,030
I would like for the sake of the students, this is why I' m doing all that...

127
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:43,390
So if there is something peculiar, she will come out and tell without me asking because

128
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:49,580
always the students accuse me, you ask so direct questions.

129
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:59,730
I try my best, as you see, to be a good student of yours.

130
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:10,240
So I bring the attention and then she says yes and then I stop and I wait.

131
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:14,680
I wait with the hope that she may come and say, you know something?

132
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,780
I'm hearing better with the noise.

133
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,750
It doesn't come out, so what shall I do?

134
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:25,190
Then I ask, is there any condition in which you are hearing better?

135
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,770
I put not a direct question.

136
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:34,530
Then she comes up, she misunderstands my answer.

137
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:40,590
I don't want still to put the direct question and eventually because the symptom exists,

138
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:45,020
it is strong and she knows it, eventually she brings it out.

139
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:59,750
The thing is that if I had done that without explaining to you what I'm doing,

140
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:03,500
I'm sure I would come to the class, I let you see the case

141
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,000
and you prescribe most of you Calcarea carbonica, from Calc carbo to Sepia,

142
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:12,170
all the range outside of Graphites.

143
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:15,520
Why? Because you didn't pay attention.

144
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:26,170
Why I have arrived at this? In spite of the fact she would tell me in the beginning desire fish,

145
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:32,930
while I know Graphites has rather aversion to fish.

146
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,670
She misguided from the beginning.

147
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:40,420
When I came back in the middle of the interview, I enquire about fish,

148
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,420
she didn't give me the impression that she desires fish, on the contrary.

149
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:53,180
Fish, I can eat it maybe sometimes. Then I said all right.

150
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:58,510
Then I go to salt. Definitely aversion to salt, I don't want salt.

151
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:05,010
Then I remember the practitioner has said aversion to sweets.

152
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:13,250
I don't want the students to know, I don't want to go to the class and everybody says Graphites,

153
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,110
as you understand.

154
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:19,010
I want first to make aware the student that unless he is very careful,

155
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:24,510
unless he puts things together, unless he does certain mental exercises,

156
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:27,760
he will not come down with the right remedy.

157
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:32,120
First I gave the impression you don't know at all which is the right remedy.

158
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,100
But who could have known?

159
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:45,610
In between the symptomatology there is something which pops out, as long as you can dig it out.

160
00:21:51,620 --> 00:22:00,010
So it is not Mercury, it is not... It is a Graphites case.

161
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:05,260
Let us see now what happened when we gave Graphites in this case.

162
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,230
Can you go to the first follow up?

163
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:22,190
Graphites was given on April 86, about 13 months ago. Graphites 200.

164
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:26,630
-She was very positive in desire fruits and it's not there.

165
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:38,330
-That's why I said, don't rely completely to the Repertory

166
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:44,680
because Graphites may have desire fruits and it's not recorded.

167
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,080
-Only in this case or generally Graphites likes fruits?

168
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:56,310
-I don't know, I can't tell you.

169
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:06,730
-In 86 she was prescribed Graphites 200.

170
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:35,630
-After the remedy, she took the remedy on 16th of May and I saw her at 23rd.

171
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:38,630
The first week...

172
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:39,670
-What was the main complaint?

173
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:48,140
-The main complaint was bronchiectasis and hearing problem, she had very poor hearing.

174
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,480
The first week she was very tired from sleeping 10 hours every night.

175
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:59,820
She was very heavy sleep, she felt tremendously tired in the afternoon.

176
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:05,130
-She slept more hours than usual?

177
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:15,980
-She said she slept deeper than usual, also she was thirstless one week after the remedy.

178
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:27,550
She's been out socializing a lot, she has a mouth ulcer two weeks after the remedy

179
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:33,820
and she felt she was starting a cold two weeks after the remedy.

180
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:42,570
She still feels very exhausted this is four weeks after the remedy,

181
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:49,320
she was considering her period didn't come this month, she said it's becoming menopausal.

182
00:24:51,310 --> 00:25:02,480
She is been in the last couple of weeks a bit depressed. Weariness coming in the afternoon...

183
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:11,400
The ears are not discharging so much, she says she feels a bit calmer about the future

184
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:20,980
and the desire for pickles has gone. This is the only change.

185
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:29,990
Her stomach problems she seems much better at the moment.

186
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:40,050
She is still tremendously complaining about this weariness

187
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:50,110
she said she had lots of energy for a week and then she relapses, she can't cope with anything,

188
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:52,360
she can't be sleeping.

189
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:55,370
-What did she say now?

190
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:02,370
-She had this after the remedy, she felt she was going out during the day,

191
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:10,470
she could go out at night. She stopped working for the time being, she was on holidays.

192
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:16,880
But she is always complaining about fatigue and weariness.

193
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:21,380
Last night she said she slept well.

194
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:28,600
I find it difficult to analyze this case.

195
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:35,300
-Do you have any other observations?

196
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,380
-The discharge from the ear was not so strong smelling.

197
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:50,630
-The amount of the discharge is less or the same?
-She said it is less.

198
00:26:55,130 --> 00:27:02,630
-Yellow-white, offensive and sometimes brownish?
-Yes.

199
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:05,280
-The noises in the ear?

200
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:11,880
-The noises in the ear are slightly better but they change all the time.

201
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:57,880
-Two weeks after the remedy...

202
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:08,630
One week after the remedy I became thirstless which is not usual.

203
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:30,210
I felt very tired, I'm extremely tired for the first four weeks, I needed 10 hours of sleep.

204
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:37,110
-Usually how many hours do you sleep?
-Usually 7,5 to 8 hours.

205
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:38,410
-And you slept for 10 hours?

206
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:51,730
-Yes, it was beautiful sleep. Three weeks after the remedy I had great menses pain

207
00:28:51,830 --> 00:29:06,020
and particularly on urination...

208
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:11,610
...and pains on my joints.

209
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:26,670
Four weeks after the remedy I found I could not remember a name in a conversation.

210
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:31,320
-Do you remember names of people?

211
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:46,170
-Not people but a place, a flower... and I found that scaring.

212
00:29:54,340 --> 00:30:07,840
My desire for sour things is gone... My teeth have become very sensitive.

213
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:24,280
The sputum in my chest has become a lot worse.

214
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,440
-It doubled the amount or three times the amount?

215
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:54,290
-It's the same but now it's thick. It's somehow creamy and greenish...

216
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:05,190
-Did you notice any change in the sputum?

217
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:19,550
-It was much less. For the first four weeks it was better and then it became back again.

218
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:29,900
And then after six weeks after the remedy again...But it hasn't really gone much...

219
00:31:41,730 --> 00:32:01,730
When I'm tired I really get... I wear glasses, I put on my contact lenses when I'm tired.

220
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:18,730
Now I haven't slept at all and I get very, very tired and I don't feel well.

221
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:24,730
I feel better today because I had got a good night sleep last night.

222
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:32,870
-How was your energy level in this period in general?

223
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:36,170
-Not tremendously better at all.

224
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:42,920
-It was better than before the remedy or the same than before the remedy?

225
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,760
-The same or worse.

226
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:51,000
-The whole period or there was a period when it was worse and then the same and then better?

227
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:57,760
-It's the same initially and now the last month it's been worse, very draggy and I have found

228
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:03,260
that time I'm hot, every time I can't be cool.

229
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,260
-You are chilly.

230
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,510
-I can't be cool.
-You can't be cool.

231
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:19,110
-I have to be indoors and I'm hot and clammy the whole time

232
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:32,850
and I put on my thermometer to see what is going on and I'm very hot the whole time.

233
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:36,840
-Do you have any salivation, any metallic taste in your mouth?

234
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:46,940
-No, no. I cannot get cool. It's unusual for me.

235
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:59,590
-Because you were very chilly as you reported.
- If I get cold my hands get white.

236
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:01,340
-Even now?

237
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:31,860
-...The sweat when I was in hospital was very cold, feeling cold winter.

238
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:47,520
-You had streptomycin?
-Twice.

239
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:50,630
-And after the streptomycin you got cold?

240
00:34:50,730 --> 00:35:02,970
-I'm not absolutely sure how much I had... I was in hospital for six months.

241
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:09,920
-During the time of the hospital, you got the same?
-Yes, so I just wonder...

242
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:35,730
It's interesting the feeling, I was wanting air.

243
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:42,310
-Do you cry easily now?
-Not very easily.

244
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:52,730
-Your food except of the change in pickles, is there any other change?

245
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:58,470
-I'm not very hungry, I haven't got great appetite that I had before.

246
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:04,960
-You did actually cry when we were talking last time,

247
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:09,810
she has been a little bit weepy with me sometimes.

248
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:21,560
-Have you given any Tuberculinum?
-Only Hepar Sulphur and Mercury.

249
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:33,660
-...

250
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:52,910
-What about the fright, do you imagine jumping?

251
00:36:53,860 --> 00:37:00,080
-...with that impulsive side.

252
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:16,570
I notified I'm very much shy in a way, I hold back in a situation, I don't join in.

253
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:27,580
-But you look to me quite open and happy.

254
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:34,900
-Yes I'm open and happy, I just long to get strength and energy.

255
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:49,990
I get a tired feeling in the head, my head feels tired and I feel frustrated.

256
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:54,860
-Do you need a lot of sugar?
-More than used to.

257
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:15,690
-You are doing very well actually and with the next remedy...

258
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:19,780
Does she know the remedy she was taking?
-No.

259
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:49,780
-Do you have any other aversion?
-No.

260
00:38:51,990 --> 00:39:01,330
-Can you look so I can talk to you to see your hearing? Can you hear me now?

261
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:11,830
-Yes I can hear you. When I'm going in stressed situation, I will turn my hearing aid off.

262
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:20,420
-Turn it up. Can you hear me now?
-Yes you are very clear.

263
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,860
-What is your name?

264
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,080
-What is your name?

265
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:33,830
-Very well. Most probably your hearing has improved.

266
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:57,040
-I think but this weekend and I had a tremendous trouble because I needed selective hearing

267
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,630
and I couldn't.

268
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,320
-What is your name?

269
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:11,690
-What is your name? You see?
-It changes.

270
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:45,400
What do you think? She is doing well? You think she is going to commit suicide?

271
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,260
Fall into the train?

272
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:59,510
She has now impulses when the train comes but she is doing very well.

273
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,160
What is happening here? The practitioner didn't mentioned it here

274
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:13,740
but when she met me she said I don't know what is happening, her eyes are squinting,

275
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:18,410
she has impulses to commit suicide and to fall under the train,

276
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:24,910
she has all kinds of strange phenomenon happening; so she mentioned some of these

277
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:37,410
during the interview. The most interesting is this impulse to jump from a higher place,

278
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:45,760
when the train comes to jump into the train and she retreats back,

279
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:52,160
the impulse is there and then she retreats back and she is very hot

280
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:56,270
and the desire for sweets has increased.

281
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:03,910
What you have to do here is to pass judgment whether your remedy has acted.

282
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:07,760
Whether the remedy has acted there is no question about that.

283
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:10,660
Why? Because it has produced certain changes.

284
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:16,910
First of all she has slept 10 hours the day, which is a good reaction to have immediately

285
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:20,850
after a remedy a lot of sleep. It's a good reaction in generally

286
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:28,240
but in her case I did not bring about any real change in the tiredness.

287
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:32,000
She says the tiredness is the same or perhaps worse.

288
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:36,490
Also the hearing is affected, it's a bit better

289
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:41,720
but what is interesting is now coming in the tube where the noise is usually

290
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:45,910
and she could hear better, now she could not hear better in the tube.

291
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:51,420
That means that peculiarity of Graphites is gone, that means Graphites

292
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:55,660
as a remedy has done whatever it could.

293
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:00,160
There are certain other symptoms to indicate that Graphites did  whatever it could

294
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:06,260
and another layer has come up, another remedy has come up.

295
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:16,240
So Graphites has acted, it has not cured the case, the case has now some mental pathology,

296
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:20,930
the tiredness is the same, the hearing is better.

297
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:32,580
You see desire pickles is not mentioned in the Repertory for Graphites,

298
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,830
yet Graphites cures this symptom.

299
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:38,570
That means she has the desire and the possibility to cure the symptom.

300
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:43,410
So if you like, you can add desire for pickles but it's not important.

301
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:49,160
I did not base my prescription desire for pickles or desire for food.

302
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:53,750
I based my prescription in aversion to sweets, aversion to salt,

303
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:58,340
hearing impaired and the keynote.

304
00:43:58,850 --> 00:44:02,240
Therefore what is the remedy which is worse from heat?

305
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,980
She cannot cool down, worse from heat.

306
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:09,310
Desire for sweets becomes important in this case because she had aversion to sweets.

307
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:12,230
Now she desires sweets, it becomes strong.

308
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:16,240
An impulse to jump from a high place, she says my god what I'm going to do?

309
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:20,240
What is the remedy?
-Argentum nitricum.

310
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:23,990
-You see now two months after the initial prescription of Graphites,

311
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:32,070
we have the action of the Graphites finished and another remedy coming into action,

312
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:35,410
which is Argentum nitricum.

313
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:44,820
This case for me is very clear, it's Argentum nitricum, there is no question about that.

314
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:52,820
I will prescribe Argentum nitricum and I will show you what happened in the follow up,

315
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:58,920
in a year time and show you what happened after the Argentum nitricum.
