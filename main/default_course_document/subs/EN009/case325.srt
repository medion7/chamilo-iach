1
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:26,950
-The last thing that appeared was a spasm in the calves in the night.

2
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:36,110
- Cramps in calves. In bed?
-Night and in bed only.

3
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:46,010
Also the fingers of the feet she has to jump from bed and

4
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:54,780
stay straight on the floor, push on the floor, so it won't hurt.

5
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:03,010
At the beginning it started every two months, every month, now it's every two weeks.

6
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:11,690
Once in two weeks. The same strength of spasm she has also in the heart region.

7
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,430
-She feels as a cramp?

8
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:26,530
-And this minute when it happens, she can not breathe. It takes only a few seconds.

9
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:36,430
-But how long she has this spasm on the left side of the chest.

10
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,180
She is talking about the left side of the chest.

11
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,180
-The heart region.
-Heart region but it's not the heart.

12
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:55,930
-She feels inside. It's like pressure.

13
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:08,530
-Like squeeze the heart?
-It's something burning, not squeezing.

14
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,680
-And you understand intercostal neuralgia?

15
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:29,110
-No, I have not intercostal and I have not [...] my heart because I checked my heart.

16
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:38,120
-Have you been examined by some colleagues of yours?

17
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:53,950
-Yes, of course. There is a block in the right artery which is for the last 30 years,

18
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:04,160
since she was a kid, she knew about it after she gave birth to her daughter she found out

19
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,510
about it, that she has a block in the right artery.

20
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:19,660
-Did she have another pregnancy after this?
-No.

21
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,160
-The cardiologist said you can not have it?

22
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:32,510
-They didn't tell anything like this but the father had the same thing, congenital.

23
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:45,070
-How long is  these cramps on the left side chest? One year, two years, five years?

24
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,430
-One year.

25
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:53,170
-How frequently?
-Once the month.

26
00:03:54,430 --> 00:04:02,350
-With some stress? When you have some kind of grief or stress?

27
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:10,330
-The first time, a few times was when she was stressed but lately it comes at night when

28
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,330
she is not stressed, not connected with stress.

29
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,830
-Connected to exertion also?

30
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:26,280
-Not connected to exertion, it's when she is asleep.

31
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:45,430
-Has she ever tried to use dilator, vessel dilator like trinitrin to see if it is an angina?

32
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:51,980
-The only thing she took was Cactus in 7C which gave a relief, a little bit.

33
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,700
-During the pain?
-Yes.

34
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,880
-No other remedies she used?

35
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:17,970
-6-7 years ago she took Lilium Tigrinum because of pain in the low back which used to return,

36
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:22,770
this back pain, every month or twice the month.

37
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,770
Then she took Lilium Tigrinum.

38
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:28,520
-Only Lil. tig. or she took other remedies and Lil. tig.?

39
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:36,080
-No, only this. She had a very strong aggravation after the Lil. tig.

40
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:47,450
-I couldn't move and couldn't go out of bed for one week because of the back pain.

41
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:51,180
-Then the pain vanished and never came back?

42
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,200
-It came back two years ago after four years, it came once.

43
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:01,350
-And she took again Lil. tig.?
-No.

44
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,880
-She took nothing?

45
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:12,940
-She was here when it happened, we did cream Rhus tox and acupuncture.

46
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:25,760
About two years ago, when she came back from here, she took Mercurius because she

47
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:32,450
felt starting a little bit depressed and she couldn't concentrate, she would start

48
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,300
stammering while she was talking.

49
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:46,050
And she started staying at home most of the time.

50
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:52,090
-Because of the fear?
-Fear of people.

51
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,390
-Was any reason, somebody threatened you?

52
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:04,290
-They were a few things which pilled up. Twelve years ago she got divorced

53
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:13,070
and the husband married the best friend, two years later she opened a medical center

54
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:21,120
and when it went up to the peak and it was beautifully operating, her partner stole money

55
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:32,370
and made her bankrupt and two years afterwards her daughter married against her will,

56
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:36,550
she didn't even know, she was told just before the wedding that she is getting married.

57
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,950
-She has only one child?

58
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:49,700
-Yes and two years ago her father got very sick with cancer and she took care of him for

59
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,390
about a year or two years and he just died last February.

60
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:06,540
And now the mother is under her responsibility and she is also sick and everything

61
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:11,970
is under her responsibility and it's heavy for her.

62
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:20,700
She pushes herself to more and more work and she can't stand it anymore

63
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:29,890
because she came to her limits actually. She took on herself more and more work.

64
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:35,740
-At the point where she has been exhausted?

65
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:48,200
-She works from 7.30 in the morning till 4 o'clock as a medical doctor and from this time

66
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,560
till about 11-11.30 at night as a homeopath.

67
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:56,260
That's every day including holidays and weekends.

68
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:05,290
In the beginning she really loved it, it gave a good feeling, she loved it.

69
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:13,290
She loved Homeopathy and she enjoyed it, it was giving her really good feeling back

70
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:18,640
because of the feedback, because of the patients becoming healthy.

71
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:21,140
Lately she can't stand this.

72
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,560
-She feels exhausted and she can not stand anymore a telephone, if someone telephones

73
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:29,410
she says oh my god one more telephone.

74
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:42,220
-A year and a half ago she still used to wake up at 3.45 in the morning, exercise,

75
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:50,390
doing everything, studying until she goes to the patients and now she can't do it.

76
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,740
Now she is asleep sitting down.

77
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,640
-As soon as she sits down she falls asleep?

78
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:07,640
-Sometimes but she gets tired, her concentration is very bad and she even forget names

79
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:14,030
of remedies and medicines that she works every day with.

80
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:26,250
Lately she has a very strong burning pain in the heart, in this area.

81
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:35,750
-In the chest?
-Not in the chest, from left side and it goes up.

82
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,850
-In the esophagus?

83
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:55,000
-It's burning but it's a pain. It's for few minutes and it goes. She smokes too much.

84
00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:03,840
2-3 boxes the day. She tries to stop but it makes her very irritated.

85
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,870
-Trembling?

86
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:14,470
-Not trembling, irritated, nervous. She loves people, she wants to be near them but she can't.

87
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,690
It's fear and a feeling that makes her tired.

88
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:28,170
-So therefore she feels better when she is alone.

89
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:40,070
-In the beginning. The feeling is that she feels that she can't cope,

90
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:47,170
she can't be friendly enough.

91
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,820
-She does not have the energy?

92
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:58,900
-No, because she is depressed she doesn't want to affect others.

93
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:11,480
She doesn't feel at ease that maybe she will say something which is not correct

94
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,330
or something like that.

95
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:20,220
-At this moment she wants to give up work, to give up everything?

96
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:30,470
-Except work. She can leave everything but not work, she wouldn't like to leave work.

97
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:36,720
If she could concentrate only in work, on the things that she love, she would be happy

98
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,820
but she has so many other destructions around like the mother ...

99
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,470
-Originally she came from Russia?

100
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:59,910
-No, Romania. She took two years ago our room and she had a very funny reaction.

101
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:07,310
After one week she had shivering with cold in the middle of the summer, she put

102
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:14,810
four blankets but she was still shivering for one night and the next morning

103
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,410
she woke up fine.

104
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:22,910
-Was any effect from Aurum? Psychologically she felt better?

105
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:29,970
-Not really. It happened the week after the Aurum, for one night and she doesn't

106
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:35,910
have any other answer why it was like this and no other effect either.

107
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,810
-Is she a cold person?

108
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:46,220
-Normally she used to suffer from cold but the last year or the last summer,

109
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:57,320
she is very hot and the feet are burning. The soles in the night in bed.

110
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:04,970
-She takes them out.
-She takes off all the covers anyway.

111
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,470
-She is in climacteric now?

112
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:15,080
-When she was 38, when she got divorced her period stopped completely at once.

113
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:22,640
-And she never had again?
-Never.

114
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:31,800
-From last summer it is constant heat or it is flashes?

115
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:48,510
-Only in the night in bed. Only burning soles and cramps and in the night

116
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,720
and day was in the heart.

117
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,260
-But has she checked whether she has hiatus hernia?

118
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,620
-No, I haven't.

119
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:18,540
-This burning that you talked about, it comes through the esophagus or you don't know?

120
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:37,470
-It's something like spasm.
-And it's for few seconds.

121
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:56,260
-She has it here also two times.

122
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:13,670
She had pain yesterday and then it went down to the arm.

123
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:17,270
-Pain here for one hour.

124
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:38,910
Do you make fever when you are sick? You have high fever or you never have fever?

125
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:49,520
-I had fever maybe 4 times all my life but I'm never sick usually.

126
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:56,450
-You never get influenza?

127
00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:19,100
-6 years old she had tuberculosis pre-infection. They saw a mark on her right lung.

128
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,780
-Since then she had an X-ray in the lungs?

129
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:32,870
-There is nothing except nicotine. 3-4 times she had pneumonia in her life.

130
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,160
7 days with antibiotics and it was gone.

131
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,410
-When it was the last time she had pneumonia?

132
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:49,780
-3-4 years ago in the winter, with very high fever and coughing.

133
00:17:49,880 --> 00:18:03,780
-Does she ever perspire in bed?
-Not especially. Not every day.

134
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:13,880
-Which place mostly?
-Only under the arms but not much.

135
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:21,030
-Except of the fear of people does she have any other fear?

136
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:30,380
-She wouldn't stand up to her duty.

137
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,630
-Fear that she will not fulfill her duties.

138
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:45,750
-She had very strong feeling that she is not lucky, she doesn't have luck.

139
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:58,280
She is afraid to go closed to people, not to ruin her relationship with them.

140
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:09,870
-Especially with the relations is this or with everything?

141
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:15,020
-Everything. Every place she puts her hand, it's ruined.

142
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:30,330
-Any other fear? Fear of poverty, fear of dark? Thunderstorms?

143
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:41,440
-Snakes and she has some funny thing with dogs and cats.

144
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:50,330
They always like her, they come to her, they sit next to her but she has something

145
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:53,930
against them, she is not afraid of them.

146
00:19:54,150 --> 00:20:00,330
-She does not like them. You don't like dogs? You don't like cats?

147
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:08,430
-I like them but far. The funny thing is that they always come to her.

148
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,930
-She attracts them.
-Yes.

149
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:19,430
Even the dog here comes to sit next to her, they are 150 people and he comes next to her.

150
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:31,410
-I'll bring Rocky to check it. Fear of high places, looking down?

151
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:33,510
-Yes.

152
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:44,330
-Do you even get fear that others may observe what you feel?

153
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:52,910
-That's why she put an appearance for people wouldn't see what actually is going on.

154
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:57,510
That's why you said she looks very good, she looks healthy.

155
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,410
-What about likes, dislikes in food?

156
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:19,190
-She took the Lil. tig. because she loves meat, she used to love it, she still

157
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:26,050
likes it but after Lilium is less.

158
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:36,760
-What else?
-I don't like so much sweets.

159
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:48,760
-If they offer you you will take?
-Some but I put a lot of salt.

160
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,760
-Desire for salt.

161
00:21:54,510 --> 00:22:00,660
Sweets if they offer you in a house, you will eat it or you will say no thank you.

162
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:08,350
-I eat it. Because I'm polite.

163
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:20,930
-But not because perhaps she doesn't want to put on weight, because sweets put on weight.

164
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:31,270
-No I cook meat with sweet and whenever she touches it, she throws it, she can't stand it.

165
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:38,970
-But chocolate?
-Only cream she likes.

166
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:49,190
-How much she will use?
-A lot.

167
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:54,420
-Did she ever take Nat. mur.?
-A year ago she took Nat. mur.

168
00:22:54,520 --> 00:23:00,170
-Was any effect?
-No.

169
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:08,500
-Did she ever take Calc. carb.?
-A year ago. Calc. carb. 200.

170
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:15,610
-No effect?
-No.

171
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:25,150
When she is in stress at work because she works too much, she takes Nux vomica.

172
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:31,240
She never took more than 30C and it gives her a relief for a while.

173
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,320
It does work for 3-4 days.

174
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:41,150
-What about her sleep? Her sleep is good?
-Not continuously but OK.

175
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:46,500
She wakes up at night because she has to stand up because of those cramps.

176
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:53,000
-She wakes up because of cramps, not otherwise.
-No.

177
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:06,750
-Has she ever taken Sepia?
-Yes, two years ago 6C for one week.

178
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,250
-No effect?
-I don't know.

179
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:20,150
-She is working non stop all the time, she can't see if something changed.

180
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:31,100
-The nails are strong. Very strong.
-She can't cut them.

181
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:54,250
-She is somebody who would care very much about others, has anxiety about others

182
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,720
being very sympathetic?

183
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:01,990
-She said, if she wouldn't be like this, she wouldn't be a homeopath and she wouldn't

184
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:07,990
work so hard, she has sympathy to all the patients and the feedback that she gets,

185
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,960
holds her to continue working.

186
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:20,360
-Except of names her memory is weak? For instance, she wants to do something and

187
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,360
she goes to the other room to take something.

188
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:29,110
As soon as she arrives at the room, she can not remember why she came to the room?

189
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:36,520
-It happens but not very intensive but other thing that bothers her a lot, if she reads

190
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:43,460
something, she can't remember it, unless she writes it down. That's lately.

191
00:25:48,460 --> 00:26:00,460
The nails are hard but the hair is very weak. It's very soft and fine hair.

192
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:21,780
-How she would describe her emotional side. She is depressed or indifferent?

193
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:28,570
-More to the depression side and the feeling that she is alone and she wants to be with

194
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:38,370
people but she is afraid she will ruin the relationship, if she goes near, closer.

195
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,780
-Did she take Ignatia?

196
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:50,120
-After her father died last February she took Ignatia 200.

197
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,020
-At night in sleep does she have any salivation?

198
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,370
-Lately she found out that she has salivation at night.

199
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:11,770
-She said, she is stammering but I can not hear stammering.

200
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:17,770
-If she excited and tired she says again the same word.

201
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:21,230
She can't say the word, she forgets the word.

202
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:29,340
-This is different than stammering. Stammering is...

203
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:37,340
-This and she forgets the words.

204
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:54,100
She thinks that inside her there is dissatisfaction from herself, from the world, from life.

205
00:27:55,590 --> 00:28:07,950
There is some kind of dissatisfaction. She feels something like she is not good enough

206
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:14,050
and she didn't stand in the standard of expectations.

207
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:41,660
There is a dream that comes all the time and makes her jump and waked her up at night.

208
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:48,020
Sometimes the dream wakes her up and sometimes the cramps wakes her up.

209
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,160
-What is the dream?

210
00:28:50,260 --> 00:29:00,160
-That she is inside a swamp and she tries to get out of the swamp and as much as

211
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:05,850
she tries to get up, it takes her in more and more and then she wakes up.

212
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,100
It' s a dream that returns all the time.

213
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:20,500
-Did she ever have suicidal disposition?

214
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:25,750
-When she was a kid, when they sent her for three months to the sanatorium because

215
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:37,330
of the tuberculosis, she was missing home, she tried to commit suicide, to hang herself with

216
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:39,260
the belt of the dress.

217
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,540
-But never again?

218
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:52,140
-They sent her twice, so it happened twice, year after year.

219
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:08,900
-Does she grind her teeth in sleep?
-No, never.

220
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,140
-Nobody told her?

221
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:17,880
-I went to seminars with her, I don't remember her grinding and I don't remember her

222
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:24,980
snoring either. Her daughter told her that she snores.

223
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:38,120
-Does actually not like any animal or only cats and dogs?

224
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:40,060
-She is afraid of them.

225
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:45,210
-Of animals in general? Like a cow...

226
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:51,710
-Not so hysterical and extreme but she prefers to be far away.

227
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,310
-From birds?

228
00:30:55,410 --> 00:31:00,180
-From everything, even from the little flies, the insects.

229
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:20,280
-If she likes meat, she likes special meat like pork or ham or smoked?

230
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:32,130
-She likes pork, she likes ham, smoked more and she likes all the grills, the open fire.

231
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:42,280
She had mononucleosis two years ago and the doctors said that this tiredness,

232
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:46,080
this weakness is a fatigue from the mononucleosis.

233
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:02,780
It was an epidemic of mononucleosis in Israel, every third person had it.

234
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:11,820
-Even the children?
-Yes.

235
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,290
-And you got it.

236
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:23,960
-Not strong. Only in the blood test she found out that she had it.

237
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:31,460
-How is now the blood test?
-OK.

238
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:42,960
-I don't think you made any, you just say OK.
-Everything is fine.

239
00:32:54,210 --> 00:33:08,610
-Did you take Carcinosin, Tuberculinum?
-No, no nosodes. She doesn't take nosodes.

240
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:11,210
-How is her thirst?
-Medium.

241
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:16,380
-Thunderstorms?

242
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,500
-She is not afraid but it makes her more depressed.

243
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:43,550
-She has any problems with digestion, constipation, colitis, bloatedness?

244
00:33:49,550 --> 00:34:06,450
-All the years that she remembers, she has pain in the left side in the spleen area but

245
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:12,050
it's something that I have all the time.

246
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:25,450
-Do you have a time of aggravation where you feel better or worse, when you wake up in

247
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:30,030
the morning, after that, you feel better in the evening, better in the morning?

248
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:37,610
-In the morning she feels the worse until she wakes up, in the evening her concentration

249
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,210
is much better.

250
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,360
-How long it takes in the morning to come back?

251
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:53,610
-One hour, from 6-7 is unrefreshed. The worse she feels after eating, whenever she eats

252
00:34:53,710 --> 00:35:03,920
she feels very tired afterwards. She wants to sleep, she lies down and she sleeps.

253
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:17,920
-Thank you.

254
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:53,580
A lot of grief, that's one fact, really a lot of grief, long time grief.

255
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:57,830
It has to be taken into consideration.

256
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:25,080
I would like to hear the opinion of the cardiologists here, what do you think?

257
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:34,170
It reminds you of some syndrome or any possibility involving the heart?

258
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:42,320
-It is known that there exist cases of angina pectoris although the coronary results

259
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:51,420
of examinations are perfectly normal, the cause is the spasm of coronary arteries,

260
00:36:56,430 --> 00:37:01,320
the stress tests show no results at all. There are cases which you find a disturbed

261
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,920
metabolism of the myocardium.

262
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:09,820
These patients produce more lactate than usual and it is suspected that, that maybe

263
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,950
the cause of the pains.

264
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:19,850
It's not a seldom symptom, you see it quite frequently and in the cardiologic literature

265
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:21,950
is described it as syndrome X.

266
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:34,100
-In that form it comes sudden, it is acute and it goes away so fast? It can be?

267
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,700
-Yes it can be.

268
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:09,160
-She is afraid to go and have a check up but she smokes 60 cigarettes. My god!

269
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:16,160
-What we don't know exactly is what she exactly has on her coronary arteries,

270
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:21,410
which she has from birth. All we know is she has something wrong with the right

271
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:28,410
coronary artery and something not normal at the coronary artery can at a certain time

272
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:32,520
of life lead to symptoms similar to this.

273
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:52,150
-You always had this weight or you put on weight lately?

274
00:38:52,250 --> 00:39:03,510
-She put on weight the last 4-5 years. Before she did a lot of sports.

275
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:20,260
-She still eats a lot of meat.

276
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:26,540
-She likes it very much but she tries not to eat that much.

277
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:51,090
-Fear of people, let's see which are the remedies which have fear of people.

278
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:58,120
-Hyoscyamus, Nat. carb., Rhus tox. Where is Lycopodium?

279
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,010
-Yes it's there.

280
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:30,670
-Let's see what the Expert System says.

281
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:52,500
Causticum with Calc. carb. Causticum is quite ahead with a possibility of Carcinosin,

282
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,100
let's see why Causticum.

283
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:21,110
Causticum has 13 out of 25. Let's see cramps in legs and calves.

284
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:30,590
It's very strong for Causticum, cramps in calves in the night in bed, Calcarea and Causticum

285
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:36,440
are very strong together with Calc. carb.

286
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:44,590
You remember, she said I don't like sweets? And I insisted to find out.

287
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:51,840
The reason is because we have to differentiate between Calc. and Causticum.

288
00:41:51,940 --> 00:42:07,690
She feels unfortunate. This is something also interesting. Show me this rubric.

289
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:27,690
If we put desire for smoked meat of course then Causticum will be pushed very much.

290
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:34,440
It will go too high.

291
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:44,590
Therefore when you use this System it is good if you don't use some strong keynote for

292
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:52,190
one remedy and see whether the remedy is coming up even without the keynote.

293
00:42:52,890 --> 00:43:00,340
Then you are more sure that even without the keynote, the remedy is coming up with

294
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:08,540
the repertorization. This is a strong indication that the remedy most probably is correct.

295
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:17,290
Delusions, she is unfortunate, we see Bryonia, Causticum, China Staphysagria, Cub. Graphites,

296
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:21,230
Hura, Ipecacuanha, Lycopodium, Sepia and Ver. album.

297
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:25,230
-I took Staphysagria.

298
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:47,510
-The struggle in this case should be not with remedies like Nat. mur. in spite of the salt

299
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:49,270
desire for salt.

300
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:57,770
You see the difference? Nat. mur., Ignatia and Aurum they will do nothing.

301
00:43:57,870 --> 00:44:07,710
Desire for salt which is for Nat. mur. but this is not a Nat. mur. situation.

302
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:15,930
It's a long grief that brings out what? Cramps in the calves or cramps in the toes.

303
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:24,940
Causticum. Because if we say long grief, one of the main remedies for long grief

304
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:33,020
if you open Kent's Materia Medica, it says cases of long grief.

305
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:43,430
12 years ago she started one after another grief, grief, grief which ends up with some

306
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:54,430
symptomatology now which is mental, she is sympathetic, she does not want to harm others

307
00:44:56,530 --> 00:45:05,530
but also the physical symptomatology is going towards Causticum.

308
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:19,040
Therefore we can not ignore this remedy and we don't have a better possibility.

309
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:26,030
Let's see which remedy covers most of her symptoms on flat repertorisation.

310
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:35,280
Let's see on flat repertorisation, which is the remedy that covers mostly her symptoms.

311
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:45,930
Causticum must be quite high, Lycop. more symptoms, Arsen., Calcar., Sulphur and then

312
00:45:46,030 --> 00:46:01,280
Caust. Lycop. forget it, Arsen. you don't like it, Calc. carb. yes there was a possibility,

313
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:10,590
Sulphur forget, so therefore Caust. even from the flat repertorization is quite a

314
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:13,440
correct decision.

315
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:20,080
Now the problem with this case is what potency shall we use?

316
00:46:21,830 --> 00:46:37,230
Shall we use high potency, low potency, medium potency? Let me see your feelings on

317
00:46:37,330 --> 00:47:17,080
this case after the analysis. Who will CM? 50M? 10M? Six. 1M? Ten. 200? 86.

318
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:29,830
30? Four. 12? One.

319
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:59,220
200 daily, three times the day! In the beginning I thought this is a case of Calc. carb.

320
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:13,140
because what she said is, I got tired. I'm tired, I don't want... The Calc. carb. we said it

321
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:21,390
in the Materia Medica and it's very characteristic, once they get tired, they just want to

322
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:29,490
get away from everything, they want to leave their business, every obligation which they have.

323
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:38,900
The way she described it was like a Calc. carb. Not only that but when I asked her

324
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:46,640
do you think others can see what is happening inside you, a characteristic of Calc. carb.

325
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:50,900
she said yes, that's why I'm putting now a face.

326
00:48:55,650 --> 00:49:02,220
You should have investigated this question because it was very important, what does

327
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,720
she really mean.

328
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:16,720
If this is a fear that others will observe how weak I am, how the mind does not work,

329
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:24,220
fear that may others observe, this is characteristic of Calc. carb.

330
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:29,820
but she did not say exactly that.

331
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:36,640
She said I'm putting up a face so that others don't pity me perhaps.

332
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:42,890
You see the difference? I didn't want to differentiate because I didn't want to give you

333
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:48,890
the possibility of understanding what I was thinking very much because you have to think

334
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:55,640
for yourself but this is the question that you should have put up during that answer.

335
00:49:57,250 --> 00:50:05,890
Because it was not clear that it was a fear others may observe my inside. She most

336
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:11,300
probably did not want others to see that she is in a bad condition,

337
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:19,650
why should I bother others, that is different. So what is actually the answer in what I say?

338
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:26,150
-What potency she will get?

339
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:45,550
-Given the fact that she smokes so much, given the fact that this symptomatology may indicate

340
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:59,800
some problems with the arteries, I would go very low, just to be careful, I would go to 12

341
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:12,290
and I will give it 3 times the day, 12 C. Anyhow, even is she takes it once the day

342
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:20,540
if she keeps on taking it for a period of time like one month, she may start feeling after

343
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:29,290
the month, a little bit better and then you can raise the potency, you can ask the pharmacy

344
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:33,220
or raise it yourself to the next potency, number 13.

345
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:42,970
Even better 10 days, 12 and then 13 and then 14 and then 15. That will be even better.

346
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:55,370
And if you will find out after a month that you start getting less cramps and less pains

347
00:51:55,470 --> 00:52:20,650
I hope you reduce smoking and I hope that you modify a little bit your diet as well with

348
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:36,950
the fat in the meat and the meat. So actually if we are treating, she is a medical doctor

349
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:41,700
she knows everything but if you are treating somebody and you have to give ...

350
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:50,450
you have to say, you have to stop smoking and you have to say it's good if for a period

351
00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:52,990
for six months you become a vegetarian.

352
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:05,690
And then give the medicine and then the result of your medication will be much augmented

353
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:10,050
by a better diet and non smoking situation.

354
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:40,190
-She says she knew it's a slow suicide what she is doing.

355
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:49,440
-Exactly and she did not care, that's why I said this.

356
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:56,020
Once you have a patient, it doesn't matter you are a medical doctor I can speak openly,

357
00:53:56,120 --> 00:54:01,940
once you have a patient like that most probably if they don't see results immediately,

358
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:10,270
you prescribe a dose of 200 Aurum 1M and no immediate results, he gives up,

359
00:54:10,370 --> 00:54:15,000
he says forget it, I drink coffee, I drin kthis, nothing happens.

360
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:21,850
Because the long grief has taken away the joy of life.

361
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:28,500
Therefore she does not care on a level.

362
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:33,240
On another level she does but on a level they don't care.

363
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:41,830
Let me enjoy, smoke, whatever happens, happens. Is this correct?

364
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:43,180
-Very correct.
