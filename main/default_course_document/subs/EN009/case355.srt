1
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:26,660
-Tell me what happened? Did she have an accident? Did she fall down?

2
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,040
-I have no idea what happened? I had no accident, nothing of that kind, I could

3
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:37,140
imagine it might have been a draft or something but actually there is nothing.

4
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,790
-So she just woke up like this morning or is it from yesterday?

5
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,140
-It's since Friday evening.

6
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,700
-Where does she feel the pain?

7
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:57,200
-It's mainly on the right side on the sacral region. Yesterday it moved a bit to the middle

8
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,790
but then it went back to the right side and today I feel the entire bone structure on the

9
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:06,980
right side, I feel the pain.

10
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:15,540
-And she can not walk? She walks very difficult?

11
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:23,040
-Yes, it's difficult to put weight on my right leg. It's painful and I also have the fear that

12
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,050
the leg might collapse under me.

13
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:32,560
-She had this incident before in her life?

14
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:40,230
-Yes, it's many years back so I don't have exact memory of how it was precisely but

15
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:46,420
I remember also it was very difficult for me and once I had injection for it.

16
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,560
Once it happened after I had a treatment with a dentist, which lasted for hours and

17
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:58,320
I was in such a tension that after the treatment finished, I also had this.

18
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:04,570
Maybe that also has to do that I have quite a severe scoliosis.

19
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,230
-What are the modalities of the pain?

20
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:19,320
-It gets worse towards the end of the night. This morning I woke at 3 o'clock with strong

21
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:26,480
pain and I could hardly turn anymore. I can not lie on my left side, I can not lie on my

22
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,320
back; if I lie on the right side, it gets a bit better.

23
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,490
And it's really bad in the mornings when I have to get up, I can hardly leave my bed and

24
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,820
in the morning hours the pain is very severe.

25
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:49,560
And yesterday I was so exhausted that I slept at home at 2-2,30 and from 3,30 p.m. on

26
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:54,750
it got worse, all by itself without me having done anything.

27
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:00,900
And on Saturday I had a phase that I felt so much better that I dared to go swimming.

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,480
Swimming did not aggravate and also walking back to the beach did not aggravate also

29
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:13,160
not taking a shower afterwards but after all that was over, it's started getting worse again

30
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:20,150
and that also was around 3,30-4 o' clock but I'm not sure it was because that was the

31
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,410
aggravation time or due to swimming. I can't tell you.

32
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:30,720
-As I see, she can not go to the bathroom by herself, she has to be supported.

33
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:36,410
-Yes, since Saturday afternoon it really got bad. I need help.

34
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,970
-By one person or by two persons.

35
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:44,310
-I guess I would have managed with one person but they are just so caring souls

36
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,070
around me that I had two.

37
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:55,330
-Movement aggravates.

38
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:03,730
-Yes, if I have to raise myself. Sometimes it gets better after walking for a long period

39
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:09,560
of time and concerning your question about turning in bed, it's extremely difficult

40
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:15,080
hardly possible and I really have to support myself with the hand, all the time, if I turn.

41
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:23,500
I have to use my hands to turn my leg with me, when I turn in bed, very difficult.

42
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:30,330
-While she is sitting now, she has pain?

43
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:43,650
-Sitting is one of the best possibilities. If I sit very quietly, I only have a remaining

44
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,830
sensation of soreness but hardly any pain.

45
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:56,260
-Any kind of movement is much worse?
-Yes.

46
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:16,510
And any motion aggravates, even coughing aggravates.

47
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:25,100
-Sneezing, laughing?
-I didn't laugh very much either.

48
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,510
-You are afraid to laugh.

49
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:41,170
There is any special desire or aversion or thirst?

50
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:46,070
-Right now, since it's happened, my thirst is not so large

51
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:52,330
and I hardly have any appetite at all, it's almost impossible to eat anything.

52
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:56,490
Yesterday, I felt hungry some time during the day because I have not eaten anything

53
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:00,240
during the entire day and then Hannah prepared some food for me.

54
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,670
Even though I had been hungry, I couldn't eat anything.

55
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,840
When I saw the food, the hunger disappeared.

56
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,180
-Not when she smells.

57
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,990
-I hardly have any sense of smell in general. They once did a test on me

58
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:28,080
and found out that I do have some remaining smell but these every day smells

59
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,030
I do not realize I can not smell them.

60
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:34,510
-Was ever suffering with hemorrhoids?

61
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:40,930
The cold or heat does affect her?

62
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:47,370
-At the moment I feel more hot in general and I perspire a lot and I was told that

63
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,300
the perspiration stings.

64
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:59,890
My toes are cold and if I put a hot water bottle in the area of the pain, that ameliorates.

65
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,950
-Any pressure there?

66
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:13,050
-I feel no pressure, the feeling is more a feeling of soreness and if I apply pressure it aggravates.

67
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:23,640
2-3 times I had a kind of chill.

68
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,810
-Any constipation?
-Only yesterday.

69
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:43,970
The days before, the stool in the beginning was harder than usual and then turned soft.

70
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:48,120
My stool situation always has to do with the amount of drink.

71
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:54,710
Yesterday I did not drink much, I slept most of the day and that's why I probable had problems;

72
00:07:54,810 --> 00:08:00,640
the less I drink, the more I'm constipated and that finally turns into headache in general.

73
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:07,890
-Is there any dryness in the mouth?
-Yes and also a very bad taste along with it.

74
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:12,970
-Does she need to water her mouth all the time?

75
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,700
-Yes, that's the reason I'm drinking right now, not because I'm thirsty

76
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,850
but because I want to get rid of the bad taste and the dryness in my mouth.

77
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:14,580
-I'd like to add that psychologically spoken, I'm much better now.

78
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,150
-Sure.

79
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:38,130
What shall we do? This is an inflammation of the sacro-iliac junction and of course the fact

80
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:44,970
that she has not done something to aggravate, either she lifter

81
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:50,320
or she had an accident or she fell, this is not a good sign.

82
00:09:50,820 --> 00:10:15,800
It is a severe inflammation on this junction which came by itself and there is a possibility

83
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,800
that we have quite a severe condition here.

84
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:31,030
It's not a simple inflammation, so we may not expect quick results.

85
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:34,980
-No wonders.

86
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:44,330
-Especially if it is something which I'm thinking about, is somebody here rheumatologist?

87
00:10:53,590 --> 00:11:06,480
The severity of this case indicates that it might be a collagen disease

88
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:17,160
which is called inflammation of the sacro-iliac junction. I don't know the English word.

89
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:30,150
It is not a simple inflammation, it is severe. We don't have a rheumatologist here.

90
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:52,070
There is a kind of an epidemic going on at the moment, not here in the class,

91
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:06,310
it is a real epidemic. There are several cases, I've heard from the Centre in Athens, severe.

92
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:14,450
One of these such cases was so severe that she had to take pain killers

93
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:23,800
and anti inflammatory drugs and god knows what else. Not responding to homeopathic treatment.

94
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:35,560
When the inflammation is so severe and so constant, we don't like it.

95
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:42,290
We hope it is not this case, we will see from the remedy.

96
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:48,640
The remedy is not clear either and never mind how much you may try.

97
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:56,800
Give me the repertorization, so I can show you something in the repertorization.

98
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,640
The remedy does not come up.

99
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:38,140
She started twice in the afternoon after 3, also 3 a.m. ...

100
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:59,560
Pain while working, sacral region worse during motion, right sacro-iliac,

101
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:09,300
extremities coldness in toes, back pain, warm application ameliorates, odor offensive afternoon,

102
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:25,490
taste bad, coughing aggravates, any kind of motion.

103
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:39,300
You can take this symptom but it is natural that with this kind of inflammation

104
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:47,800
any kind of movement, coughing moves the whole area, with sneezing, coughing,

105
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:52,400
laughing she will have the pain, so we go to Tellurium.

106
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,620
-There is no symptom for Tellurium.

107
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:06,890
-There is but not to give a lot of emphasis into this symptom.

108
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,970
So I will tell you the remedy.

109
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:32,470
The remedy I would like to give at this moment is Lycopodium. Why?

110
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:39,900
Because I see it is on the right side first, I see lying on the right side is the best side.

111
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:44,720
I see the aggravation in the afternoon, after 3 o'clock she starts being aggravated,

112
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,380
in the afternoon and in the morning.

113
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:55,550
I have told you Lycopodium is worse 3-4 o'clock in the morning and 3-4 o'clock in the afternoon,

114
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:59,150
it starts getting aggravated.

115
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:10,640
It is worse in the morning, worse motion and likes warm but still

116
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,970
she will like fresh air as well, most probably.

117
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:30,490
Anyhow, Lycopodium is the remedy and we'll give her a dose of Lycopodium quite high

118
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:35,400
because we like to have quick results.

119
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:52,980
Very quick, it can not be the same result as his case, it can not be though

120
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,820
if the remedy is correct it may give a few hours,

121
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:05,820
maybe a kind of amelioration of the order of 10-20%.

122
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:27,820
Where is Lycopodium? What position?

123
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:55,760
She had also the better lying on right side as well, she has the right sidedness

124
00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:03,570
which is not recorded of course. And that's why you can not see the remedy.

125
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,650
-You have an acute condition.

126
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:41,910
-Yesterday I got a note from home that my mother is very sick.

127
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:47,220
She is in intensive care in the hospital and yesterday for quite some time they weren't sure

128
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,990
if she will survive.

129
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:56,990
And before she was quite fit, it was totally unexpected.

130
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:08,580
And I was crying all the evening and all night, I couldn't think clear, I really...

131
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:18,210
-I saw her this morning, red eyes crying all night.

132
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,550
-That was nothing this morning, it was much worse tonight.

133
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,870
There was really panic this morning. I think there is so many things not yet settled

134
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:34,620
not yet cleared concerning the relationship with the mother...

135
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:44,780
-So she is attached to her mother?

136
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:51,030
-It had been difficult the last years because I had been abused in my childhood

137
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:56,030
and I'm quite sure that she knew about it, I'm not totally sure

138
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:03,460
but my feeling says that she knew about this and she didn't protect me.

139
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:12,120
And I always wished the time to be right to talk about this because we now have more or less

140
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:17,890
a superficial relationship and she and me, both sides, we suffered from this.

141
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:25,040
Now I got panic with the idea that she might go without me being able to show her

142
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:29,880
that it might be OK for me one time just to forgive her.

143
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,880
Up to now I had not been able to forgive her, so it wasn't possible to let her know.

144
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:47,360
-How does she feel now? If I asked her to describe her state, her state is

145
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:53,060
anxiety, panic, depression, remorse?

146
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:57,890
-It's confusion and a lot of fear.

147
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,610
-Fear for what?

148
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:06,110
-A lot of fear that she might go and I won't be able to see her again

149
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:09,290
and that she would just be gone.

150
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,540
-Was she able to eat last night?

151
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:28,800
-This morning I tried to eat a little bit because I was so weak that I hardly could stand.

152
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:33,220
But I can't really tolerate it, I feel nauseated.

153
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:46,470
-What about water? She can drink water?
-Yes.

154
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:53,690
-But the solid food would not go down even?

155
00:21:54,140 --> 00:22:01,550
-It's difficult. What I tried was muesli and yogurt because that was easier to shallow.

156
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,210
A friend of mine that has been holding me a long time yesterday evening,

157
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:12,530
she told me this morning that I had a very bad smell of my body yesterday night.

158
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:16,380
She couldn't really described it but she just remarked it.

159
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:29,460
-She did not sleep at all last night? She saw any dream?

160
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:36,310
-Yes, some hours. Only very rarely I can recall a dream. Nearly never.

161
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:51,620
-When it was the last time she contacted her brother to give her some news?

162
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,220
-This morning.

163
00:22:55,220 --> 00:23:02,150
-And your mother was in intensive care?
-Yes.

164
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:08,120
-But she vomited blood?

165
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,720
-They told me it looks like coffee what she vomited.

166
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:21,870
-That's bleeding of the stomach. But why they said she is almost dying?

167
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:26,450
-Yesterday the doctors in the hospital told my brother that for half an hour they weren't sure

168
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:31,120
that she will survive, it was very critical and in the evening they said

169
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:37,120
she is not yet over the climax, she is not yet through the crisis.

170
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:43,030
She had an arrest of breathing and she had an extreme fall of the blood pressure

171
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,220
so that her kidneys wouldn't function anymore.

172
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:03,620
-Otherwise how she was doing just before she had that?

173
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:10,380
-After Lycopodium I felt great, wonderful, I was even able to rent rooms for my new office,

174
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,960
for my new practices but then my energy went down a little bit and then in February

175
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:19,470
I got an acute with a high fever over several days.

176
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:21,960
-She took a remedy?

177
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:35,980
-I smelled twice on the Lycopodium bottle of 50M and there was a reaction

178
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:42,710
and during this time when I was so sick, that disappointment too

179
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:49,850
because the man with whom I'm  together for some years already, he didn't care all together

180
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:50,950
for me being so sick.

181
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:56,180
I would reproach him and since then I hardly ever saw him again.

182
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:02,860
I saw him maybe 3 times within 3 months and I was very disappointed.

183
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,850
-This disappointment affected her health?

184
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:15,760
-Yes, I had the impression for 3 months that I was in a stagnation on the same level

185
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:25,270
nothing would move anymore and too about 3 weeks ago I got pains in my right breast

186
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:32,440
and they were so severe that I went to have a check and they were nodes

187
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:39,440
and the doctor found out it's a swelling of the glands and he took a sample

188
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:48,210
and he found out that this is cyst.

189
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,530
Since Monday again I'm having these pains.

190
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:59,770
-Last time she was here she was with a severe lumbago, this went away?

191
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:05,930
-Yes, I repeated at home 2 weeks later, the 50M and now is practically gone.

192
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:10,870
Every now and then I would feel it a little bit but nothing really bothers me.

193
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:17,110
-Lately she has found out perhaps she is taking more salt?

194
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:18,870
-A little bit yes.

195
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:23,540
-Sweets?
-Rather aversion.

196
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:28,950
Every now and then I will be able to eat a little bit of sweet but not really.

197
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:37,770
-Now she is here she is bathing in the sea?

198
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:44,010
-Not up to now but I'm very busy studying but I think if I really wanted to,

199
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:47,600
if it would have such an importance to me, I would have gone for a bath.

200
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:52,520
-Would she stay under the sun? She does not like it?

201
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:58,520
-No, I can't endure it, if it's so hot I have to go...

202
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:06,110
-After this disappointment she had with this boyfriend, she felt more closed towards men?

203
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:12,770
-Yes but it's been like this already before, I'm not that open to men.

204
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:19,040
Only to somebody who is very close to me, very known.

205
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,370
-I don't follow.

206
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:28,200
-Already before this disappointment it's already been the case that

207
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,940
I've been rather closed towards men.

208
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:36,810
I only could open up towards men that I was very confidential with, known for a long time,

209
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,970
that I was already very close.

210
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:42,110
-But this boyfriend was one of those people, close.

211
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:46,690
-Yes, we were for about 20 years, I nearly daily worked together with him.

212
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,780
-For 20 years they know each other?

213
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:54,940
-18 years. But maybe I have to mention that he is married which might explain a little bit

214
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,630
his position towards me, his reaction towards me.

215
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:13,620
-Do you eat meat?
-Little but it should be spicy and smoked.

216
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:19,870
-Smoked meat she likes?
-The main point is spicy.

217
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:24,940
-What about the fat in the meat?
-Not so much.

218
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:32,700
After I had the acute, I had an expressive aversion against it but now it got less again.

219
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,110
But I don't need to have it.

220
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:38,620
-The fat?
-Yes, the fat.

221
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:46,530
-Her perspiration, which she says is offensive, she herself has any idea

222
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:50,860
what type of offensiveness?
-I don't have any sense of smell.

223
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,360
I can't even recall if I ever had one but maybe this is

224
00:28:55,460 --> 00:29:03,970
an idea since I have this acute, I have every morning bad taste in my mouth.

225
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:11,940
Sometimes my saliva was even blood stained, rarely only 3-4 times.

226
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,620
-Was any salivation during sleep?
-Yes.

227
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:21,710
-The gums are bleeding when she brushes?
-No.

228
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:26,710
-The taste is ever metallic?
-No.

229
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:34,270
-When she perspires she feels good, she feels bad or she feels indifferent?

230
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:41,710
-It does not much of a difference, only I can't control and I'm afraid I might smell badly.

231
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:53,850
-In general she feels more towards cold or more heat?

232
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:58,460
-I need a lot of fresh air and I stick out my feet under the covers.

233
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:10,560
-She had reported coldness of toes.

234
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:15,510
-I don't have that anymore, very rarely, in rare exceptions.

235
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:22,740
-Would she say she is more warm than before?

236
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:29,900
-It didn't change that much I would say. Nevertheless I can very well tolerate local heat,

237
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,260
like if I have some problems with my back I can tolerate local heat in my back.

238
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:38,660
-She sleeps on a particular position?

239
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:44,080
-As I have strong scoliosis I'm trying to lie on my left side

240
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:47,500
but I'm quite well lying on my back.

241
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:59,740
Another thing I remark recently is that my memory got very bad again.

242
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:07,360
For example I recently had a handful of cherries and I washed them and afterwards

243
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:12,460
I didn't know what I did with them, did I eat them? Where did they disappear to?

244
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:18,450
I couldn't tell anymore and there lots of examples.

245
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:26,020
-If she has taken a decision, she can make a decision?

246
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:31,120
-Not as good as I'd like to be able to make a decision but it's possible.

247
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:42,110
-Her self-confidence has improved since the beginning of treatment?

248
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:47,600
-It had already been better and I think superficially seen that' OK

249
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:51,980
but when you get into the depth, it's wanting.

250
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:58,460
For example at home I would wake up with a terrible mood and always started at that moment

251
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:02,190
when I was opening up my eyes and because it was so bad,

252
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:13,200
I used to start with 10 min. of auto training before I open up my eyes and that is the way

253
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:20,280
how I realized I have no laugh for myself but I only realized when I really go into myself

254
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,030
on a deeper level.

255
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:25,540
On every day basis I can easily go over it.

256
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:42,780
Recently I found out that I feel disgusted for certain things and it's a sort of disgusted

257
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:49,770
that I can't really understand. For example I feel disgusted for giving myself to somebody

258
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:56,210
I find really nice and whom I like very much and nevertheless I feel disgusted to shake hands.

259
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,210
-To a man usually or even to a woman?
-Maybe everybody.

260
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:03,160
-How is her sexual desire?

261
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:08,030
-Not people that I feel not sympathetic, it's maybe anybody.

262
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:15,120
It's mainly if somebody is close to me that decides this I feel sexual desire

263
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:18,220
but it's very difficult for me to let go.

264
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:30,120
-Do you have any leucorrhea?
-Every now and then and then I feel marvelous.

265
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:33,660
Just a little bit of leucorrhea and I feel great.

266
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:24,770
-This nice woman I saw in the morning and she was absolutely crying and my mother...

267
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:40,690
She was acting like a Baryta carb. I'm protected, I lose my mother.

268
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:46,250
Then I said what's the problem with your mother?

269
00:34:46,350 --> 00:35:02,360
She said, my mother vomited blood and I said OK, if she vomited blood she will not die,

270
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:05,180
they can save her very easily.

271
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:13,760
If she had a heart attack, if she had a brain stroke, it's different

272
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:21,940
but vomiting blood is not somebody who dies. You don't agree?

273
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:26,090
-Lots of people die.

274
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:29,430
-With what? By hemorrhage?

275
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:32,780
-By hemorrhage from the stomach, it' s a major cause of death.

276
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:40,280
Thousands of people die from taking aspirin.

277
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:49,260
-Anyhow it's not my experience, I haven't been living in a hospital

278
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:57,760
but anyhow when I told her that, her mood changed. Due to the information which I gave,

279
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:09,940
which I believe according to my understanding it is true and she is much better.

280
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:17,940
Now the problem is what shall we do in order to help her.

281
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:41,610
Are we going to give Ignatia? She does not have symptoms of Ignatia.

282
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:49,120
You can see she is not sighing. The first thing we will see in such a case is sighing.

283
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:59,250
So there is some deeper problem than Ignatia and as she explained the relationship

284
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:09,680
with her mother has been quite a stressful one and she is afraid the mother may go

285
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:16,860
and this will not straighten up. The relationship will not be cleared.

286
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:25,020
So it is a deep grief and there is a grief also which preceded that grief

287
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,760
with her boyfriend and the disappointment.

288
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:33,360
So we have a love disappointment and we have also this grief.

289
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:48,880
We propose a dose of Nat. mur. in case you go into depression because of your mother.

290
00:37:48,980 --> 00:38:00,220
But let us say your mother is well. Tonight you hear she is better, what you will say?

291
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,640
How you will feel? Very happy.

292
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:11,720
-I think I will be back into the confused state that I had been in before.

293
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:16,470
The feeling that still something has to be cleared and to be straightened out

294
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:26,490
but I think too it will be a push to really get the things started.

295
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:33,720
Another thing I want to mention is that I think I sighed and during the last weeks

296
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:39,560
I had a sort of pressure on my breast, that I couldn't breathe really deeply,

297
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:44,660
in case this might be important.

298
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:59,160
-But what I would suggest at this moment is, wait until you hear about your mother.

299
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:10,760
I believe she will be all right and then see how you feel and then we talk again.

300
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:15,520
Are you going to leave tonight to go to your mother?

301
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:23,930
You phone first and then you decide what you have to do but you have in mind

302
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:32,850
if things are going bad, you take a dose of Nat. mur. even higher 1M.

303
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:47,910
-I want to add in these circumstances that I would really have disliked being alone

304
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:53,130
that it would really be very difficult for me to stay alone yesterday night.

305
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,430
I even let the door to my balcony open tonight to feel more connected.

306
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:15,180
-She sighed 2-3 times.

307
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,930
-Pulsatilla is better.

308
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:38,350
-And she lies on the back, also Pulsatilla very strong.

309
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:48,760
-I would rather give her Pulsatilla because there is also leucorrhea ameliorates

310
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:54,870
one of these 4 symptoms, 1 is Pulsatilla, she doesn't like fat meat,

311
00:40:54,970 --> 00:41:04,690
she put the feet out of bed at night and she is warm and she doesn't like the sun.

312
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:07,950
-Pulsatilla is, yes.

313
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:12,940
-And she likes fresh air.

314
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:48,110
-OK, we'll change, take Pulsatilla, in case something happens with your mother, 1M.
