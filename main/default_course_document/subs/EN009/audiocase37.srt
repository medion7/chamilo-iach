1
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:49,430
This is a 124 kilos woman, 270 pounds.

2
00:00:51,650 --> 00:01:04,350
She is a Ph.A. in anesthesiology.

3
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:25,930
She has obesity and she has problems with her menses. She is 28.

4
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,680
Until 23 years old the menses were normal, every 28 days.

5
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,100
She had some emotional problems with her family

6
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:50,850
that as an effect had the delay of menses to the extent that she has menses

7
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:58,820
every 40 days now and reaches up to 2 months.

8
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:15,070
That was the case until two years ago when she got into fight with a friend of hers

9
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:32,490
while at the same time she was taking Terolak. It must be some hormone.

10
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:40,590
Then she had a metrorrhagia and she took estrogen for that.

11
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:52,070
There was a delay of 4 months and then kept on coming late, 2-3 months.

12
00:02:52,170 --> 00:03:01,820
The last time she saw her menses is in January 81 and she had come to us in January 82.

13
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,510
One year now with no menses.

14
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:31,420
Sorry, October 81 she had again menses with great amount of blood and clots.

15
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:46,720
In order to stop it she took the preventing hormones, the birth control pills.

16
00:03:52,820 --> 00:04:07,500
In 30 days normal menses and pain with much blood and the membrane

17
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,860
of the uterus was coming out.

18
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:20,830
She took again birth control pills for two months.

19
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:31,000
Three years ago she had become pregnant but she did voluntary abortion.

20
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:38,000
Three years ago.

21
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:45,740
Since she was 16 years old, she started putting on weight very rapidly

22
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,000
after the separation of her parents.

23
00:04:54,710 --> 00:05:03,210
Many times she had tried different fasts but as soon as she stopped the fast, she'd retake the kilos.

24
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:09,780
She would take up to 7 kilos the week.

25
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:28,120
She went to a homeopath who was in the Center for some time

26
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,360
and he is working by himself now

27
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:39,510
and he gave her Natrum Muriaticum and some Kalium.

28
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:05,750
This is her doctor who stayed in the Center for six months.

29
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:17,590
He gave her about 3-4 remedies trying to find the right one.

30
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:31,920
Anyhow that was his assessment.

31
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:38,200
When she used to get normal menses, she had 4 days of blood.

32
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:44,420
The first two days a lot of blood and then the last two days less.

33
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:55,080
The last day had a lot of blood and during the night also.

34
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:06,920
That was worse movement and better lying down, the pain was better then.

35
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:22,830
The last period with menses was quite a lot of blood with clots and

36
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:38,420
she had a lot of metrorrhagia during night and that was worse by movement

37
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:46,330
and better lying down.

38
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:56,420
The blood was coming out more when she was walking and if she lies down

39
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,120
the blood would come out less.

40
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:11,750
The last menses is the last menses. When I hear that it doesn't register...

41
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:18,920
The last menses what? Is it a big keynote what she is talking about?

42
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:37,830
But you don't have it as a constant thing coming all your life which you take...

43
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:46,090
You are about to laugh easily and what I wanted to tell you is

44
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:49,670
when I was taking the case she was telling me about the other doctors and how

45
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:57,080
they ridicule her. Don't laugh.

46
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:07,120
We should be at the corner when one of these patients goes to them and tells about that.

47
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:22,840
When we laugh with the mistakes of somebody else, that's better at that time to think

48
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:28,260
of our own mistakes and then we feel better.

49
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:56,170
Pain on the right foot, on the anterior side of the thigh, starting from knee going upwards.

50
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:04,680
This pain started 20 days after taking the birth control pills.

51
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:15,090
She says she is taking a lot of X-Ray because she is working on that department.

52
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:25,350
She has pain in the back in the lumbar region in the center, worse motion, underlined twice.

53
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:31,820
And she explained that my weight is so much that I feel this is from my overweight

54
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,650
that I have that pain.

55
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:46,770
Better lying down on the back, better when she sits bending forward underlined once.

56
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:57,350
Wakes up with pain in the back in the morning, as if I have not rested at all.

57
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:13,400
Pain on the cervical region and between the shoulder blade.

58
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:42,770
Worse with exertion, the pain on the cervical and worse towards the end of her work.

59
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:52,650
This pain is better by movement and worse by keeping it immovable.

60
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:57,140
This pain in the cervical is better by movement, underlined twice.

61
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:05,230
So the pain in the back is worse motion twice and the pain in the cervical

62
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:09,000
better with movement, underlined twice.

63
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:23,370
Her hair is very greasy and in two days she must wash again.

64
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:39,160
Diarrhea twice. All kinds of fat brings diarrhea, underlined twice.

65
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:47,250
If I eat soft boiled egg, I will start having diarrhea within two hours.

66
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:58,360
Many times I have an intense desire to eat green things

67
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:06,490
because by eating green things the diarrhea stops.

68
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:10,500
That's peculiar. Usually the diarrhea...

69
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:20,700
The diarrhea starts about 1,30 hour after eating and she has pain,

70
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:31,340
especially if she eats something fat. Worse anxiety and worse fasting.

71
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:39,370
The pain and the diarrhea.

72
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:51,500
When I am tired and psychologically tired I just want to eat.

73
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,120
She goes there and eats all the time.

74
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:15,260
She says I want to eat because the eating anesthetizes me.

75
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:29,930
Often tachycardia, sleeps on the abdomen, all the time she changes position.

76
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:50,130
When I wake up I feel stiffness but when I go into the bathroom

77
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:53,960
and I have a bath, I feel better.

78
00:14:54,060 --> 00:15:02,880
I keep my feet inside, I have nightmares.

79
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:14,620
Until 23 years old, she had dreams of flying.

80
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:28,620
Feet perspire all the time in winter and the summer.

81
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,950
Very warm extremities.

82
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:52,200
Warm water in the spine makes me feel much better, underlined 3 times.

83
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:33,870
Can anyone see the remedy?

84
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:11,800
Better warm water 3 times, better motion, pain here.

85
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:33,780
Calc. phos. is the best until now.

86
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:51,170
When I'm not feeling well I just lie down and I don't want to see anybody.

87
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:59,840
The only thing that makes me feel better this time is music.

88
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:09,260
She is a singer, she sings very nicely, music touches her very much and

89
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:22,970
brings about something that is better than the indifference in which she is inside.

90
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:42,030
She is worse with cloudy weather, one underline.

91
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:50,890
When it's cloudy weather I don't want to sleep, I feel an empty feeling in the stomach

92
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:54,390
and I'm just bored from everything.

93
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:09,890
She is an open character, she talks for her problems,

94
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:21,790
Anxiety in her work, I'm concerned to see people sick, which is underlined twice.

95
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:40,620
She talks and laughs a lot, the doctor says constantly she asked what are you writing?

96
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,820
Desires company, underlined 3 times.

97
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:54,120
Thirsty for cold twice, desires spinach, lemon and fizzy drinks twice.

98
00:19:54,220 --> 00:20:03,620
Aversion to sweets, no underline and aversion to salt, no underline.

99
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:18,370
In the morning I sleep always better - don't change the remedy because the remedy

100
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:28,040
is not so difficult...

101
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:37,540
Likes warm weather, neither she is feeling too cold nor too hot.

102
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:44,200
When I go out in the summer suddenly the sun brings me a kind of unwell feeling.

103
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:56,710
Likes the sea underline twice, much cold if I walk outside, it bothers me.

104
00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:04,120
She has some fears of thunderstorms, no underline.

105
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:09,630
She likes dancing, she likes actually very much dancing she says later.

106
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:21,200
I cannot tolerate tight clothes,

107
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:31,290
fear earthquakes,

108
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:45,320
fear of dead, fear cemeteries, fear of ghosts,

109
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:53,740
fear that somebody might do some harm to her, all this not underlined.

110
00:21:53,840 --> 00:22:02,270
She says I need affection, she is generally an open person and very joyful,

111
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:10,000
when she is in company.

112
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:23,070
That's the case.

113
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:43,770
What about that?

114
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:50,900
Pulsatilla only ameliorates in the sea but because it is cold.

115
00:22:51,000 --> 00:23:01,740
She is ameliorated in taking a cold bath.

116
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:11,080
It might be aggravated but mostly the basic description of that would be

117
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:16,740
a Pulsatilla which is ameliorated by cold.

118
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:27,400
General amelioration by a cold bathing and local amelioration by a cold bathing.

119
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:33,820
But you may see an arthritic condition of Pulsatilla, they go inside the sea

120
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:41,840
and they get better.

121
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:51,190
-Give her Medorrhinum.

122
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:55,660
-No it's not. You have to differentiate between local amelioration and general amelioration,

123
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:01,380
which is a different thing.

124
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:07,320
Ledum is the same thing. It goes into cold and it's ameliorated.

125
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:13,880
Ledum needs very cold. Pulsatilla with just cool water could be OK.

126
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:25,290
Ledum must be ice cold. You go to Guaiacum.

127
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:32,990
It's the same thing. Not ice cold but cold.

128
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:45,040
Cold ameliorates but now Pulsatilla has worse from the pains on the knee mostly & Guaicum has worse pains on the wrists.

129
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:56,550
So we have two symptoms; ameliorated by cold and we have arthritic pains...

130
00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:04,380
Where are the arthritic pains? Whether they are here or whether they are there,

131
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:13,830
they determine what we give.

132
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:21,000
But it's not that Pulsatilla cannot have pains on the wrists, it has pains all over.

133
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:26,830
Guaiacum prefers in most of the cases, it develops an inflammation on the wrists

134
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:33,670
and Pulsatilla prefers to develop an inflammation on the knees.

135
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:55,010
Actually except of the worse with fat, except of that, which is a keynote for Pulsatilla,

136
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:59,590
what are the remedies?

137
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:03,130
-Nat muriaticum.

138
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:19,090
-China.

139
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:26,840
-Carbo vegetabilis.

140
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:31,360
-Carbo vegetabilis is a remedy that is aggravated and we don't usually think about.

141
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:38,200
Also another remedy, a small remedy starting with C...

142
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,440
-Cyclamen.

143
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:50,460
-Cyclamen yes.

144
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:28,530
Except of that do we have another keynote, another strong symptom for Pulsatilla?

145
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:30,690
-Sun aggravates.

146
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:34,110
-Sun aggravates. How much is that?

147
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:47,370
-Three.

148
00:27:51,620 --> 00:28:05,130
-Neither too cold nor very hot.

149
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:17,610
I don't see it. Is it underlined 3 times?

150
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:44,030
She feels neither of the extremes but somewhere she says she says a little bit towards the cold

151
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:49,360
-Worse is too cold outside.

152
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:55,940
-This will make you be careful about Pulsatilla, this information.

153
00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:05,430
Pulsatilla is quite strong.

154
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:09,220
Another thing you must remember about remedies.

155
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:13,180
You say Arsenicum always is cold and Pulsatilla always is hot

156
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,460
and that is true with some exception.

157
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:24,130
Just have in mind these exceptions but use exception on the right time.

158
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:40,880
OK the person sometimes is cold but you have to have strong evidence

159
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:47,170
that in spite of being cold, that is a Pulsatilla case. Strong evidence.

160
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:51,960
Do not forget this main characteristic of remedies, don't put it aside just like that

161
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:56,550
because you want to say it is a case of Arsenicum.

162
00:29:56,650 --> 00:30:04,120
And you say it's not ameliorated by heat but I can feel the Arsenicum.

163
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:12,630
No, you have to have strong reasons for that; otherwise most probably it's another remedy.

164
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:24,250
You tend to do a lot of that. I understand why perhaps.

165
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:27,830
Because you are in practice before you have enough knowledge,

166
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:32,960
enough information and you want to give something, you must give a remedy

167
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:39,120
within a limit of time and that's where you make the mistake.

168
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:57,460
We got a situation with the supervised clinic where you just give your idea

169
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,540
and then somebody else...

170
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:22,100
She is afraid of thunderstorms without any underline.

171
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:29,020
I want to ask you about that symptom.

172
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:37,930
Would you use it for a reference on another case of Graphites or you would not use it?

173
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:48,770
Should this symptom, the fear of thunderstorm no underlined...

174
00:31:54,620 --> 00:32:09,510
Are you going to take it out as a feature of Graphites? No. Yes?

175
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:21,520
-I wouldn't highlight it.

176
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:31,610
-If you are doing work of adding symptomatology on the Repertory systematically,

177
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:40,710
that means having a book in which it is A, B, C, and you have your remedies...

178
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:48,930
You know a book with A five pages, B five pages, this kind of book.

179
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:53,910
You find a remedy first that you have, how you do this systematically?

180
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:58,790
You put Graphites there and you put down

181
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:01,870
fear of thunderstorms because it was cured.

182
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:07,370
Now you get another case. You don't remember that a year ago you put that to

183
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:12,040
Graphites fear thunderstorm, you see again there cured,

184
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:20,370
take it and insert it in your additions.

185
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:30,540
In this case if you have a symptom and it is cured and it went away,

186
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:36,530
that means something was there, the feeling was there and now it's not...

187
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:42,610
Even that you don't get it strongly and that the symptom went away.

188
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:49,400
Never mind how it was not intense the fear, the fear was there and now it is not.

189
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,780
So you really have a symptom.

190
00:33:52,880 --> 00:34:02,360
You can use that work for adding symptoms, you can use it.

191
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:13,280
-Provided...

192
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:22,090
-It might be that the person has given it on a low key when it was perhaps stronger.

193
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:28,250
But now it knows the difference. What else is there?

194
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:34,340
-Desire for soft boiled eggs.

195
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:41,670
-What else did we say she has? There is a desire for soft boiled eggs.

196
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:44,530
What else Calcarea has concerning eggs?

197
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:49,880
-Aversion.

198
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:58,290
-When we spoke about Calcarea, if you remember it feels better eating eggs.

199
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:06,340
If you remember, we have spoken about Calcarea better eating eggs.

200
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:20,260
That means you may find a case of cholecystitis or cholelithiasis from the gallbladder

201
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:31,420
and being better by eating eggs and that's very peculiar because in the pathology

202
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:36,420
that can be a Calcarea carbonica case. Better by eating eggs.

203
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:48,340
But worse eating eggs is not a symptom of Calcarea.

204
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:53,870
You have to differentiate the information.

205
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:18,500
The Nat Carbo would be much more closed person, a more sensitive person.

206
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:24,260
She is outgoing quite a lot, when she is bored out, I don't want to see anybody.

207
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:33,840
That is another type of that type we have described in Natrum Carbonicum but

208
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:42,810
they are concerned about others, they have certain aversion to certain people.

209
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:53,870
That is the attitude of Natrum Carbonicum.

210
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:59,970
Here we don't see that sensitivity, it's an outgoing person. This is a real extrovert.

211
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:09,800
When she is out there, she is a real extrovert, she enjoys, she laughs.

212
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:23,760
That also makes the case with a good prognosis.

213
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:33,190
A person who tells everything, it doesn't keep to himself.

214
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:49,470
It's bound to have more diseases than the one who is an extrovert, the one who interacts.

215
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:59,140
A person who is impulsive is bound to have much less to suffer

216
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:06,460
than a person who is an introvert. What happens in the two cases?

217
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,970
They are destructing forces.

218
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:23,630
There are destructing forces acting all the way.

219
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:31,880
The extrovert lets these forces to interact with others outside of him.

220
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:40,140
The introvert allows these forces to act within him, so he keeps them to himself.

221
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:46,410
So the extrovert destroys the others and the introvert destroys himself.

222
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:59,630
The extrovert is a person who will bring out anything, enjoys himself and he gets it out,

223
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:06,420
what happens to the other person, he doesn't care.

224
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:19,220
But the introvert allows these forces to interact inside and become destructive.

225
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:31,980
You saw that case how she allowed this argument to sink inside?

226
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:42,750
I could see how destructive could have been and it was, not to speak out at that moment to the other girl,

227
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:51,160
that she just let her and she didn't know what to do, she was humiliated.

228
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:55,820
And it went deep inside. She did not interact.

229
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:01,320
She did not do the right thing at the right moment.

230
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:06,320
And all the forces remained inside and destroyed her.

231
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,980
So what is the best?

232
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:21,360
-The "golden rule".

233
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:28,150
-The ancients used to say the "golden mean" is the best if you can strike a path

234
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:46,170
which is always walk on a tight rope.

235
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:12,980
Now there is an uprising trend in the consciousness of people.

236
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:19,070
When you up rise your consciousness for the first time, and you have seen how

237
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:23,190
all children started to be extrovert.

238
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:30,480
They, themselves is the most important in the world and everybody else at that age.

239
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:44,400
So they started extrovert, do that and do that. They started as extrovert.

240
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:49,060
We are children as far as spiritually also.

241
00:41:49,160 --> 00:42:04,820
In a way we are concerned about ourselves quite a lot.

242
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:08,110
As humanity progresses towards a higher state of evolution,

243
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:13,820
people become aware more and more of the destruction they can have,

244
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:19,370
their saying, their words, their acts.

245
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:23,730
The force that this world can have upon others.

246
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:31,320
Suddenly they realize that and then they become introvert.

247
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:39,230
Now in this process of consciousness as they go from extrovert to introvert,

248
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:44,650
diseases are coming up.

249
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:55,730
You will see, most of you have been involved in spiritual things,

250
00:42:55,830 --> 00:43:06,490
what you have found is that at a certain stage you become quite a fanatic

251
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:09,390
on what you believe to be the truth.

252
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:15,890
Now you are going to act on that and what you will do?

253
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:32,330
For 5 years in my life  I didn't eat meat, I will eat rice every day and vegetables.

254
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:40,330
The result was that I lost quite a lot of my energy because I was not paying attention to what I was eating.

255
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:49,250
In my effort to evolve myself, I destroyed quite a lot of myself but I did not only do that.

256
00:43:49,350 --> 00:44:01,660
I did other things. Sex out. You know how you do these things.

257
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:16,320
For 10 years a young man who is quite normal decides no sex. Strange.

258
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:28,240
And I realized quickly enough that that might not be the right path to follow and I have to find a way to compromise.

259
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:41,660
All this resulted in all this preparation of mine from another point of view.

260
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:47,480
When I put my mind on something immediately I was there.

261
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:56,875
Smoking never. Drugs out of question really. Of course that gave me all the possibilities to be able

262
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:12,880
 to concentrate and do what I had to do. To find out what was lacking in Homeopathy.

263
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:21,700
It allowed me to put quickly my mind and concentrate my mind immediately on the issue

264
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:32,950
but to the expense of my health.

265
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:50,850
And everybody who is doing some harm within himself...

266
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:57,320
because he does not allow forces to express.

267
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:05,090
So if we see a case like that, who is an extrovert

268
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:16,490
we may induce that she is not going to go and to (?)

269
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:21,240
To have hormonal disturbances at the moment.

270
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:25,990
And if we decide the right remedy and the right remedy should be quite easy to find

271
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:29,950
in such cases also.

272
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:35,450
These patients is easy to find, easy to see the remedy, the extrovert are easy to

273
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:38,540
find the remedy.

274
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:58,780
You saw the people that we saw in video, the introvert, difficult to decide.

275
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:14,370
In the next video you will see what I mean.

276
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:25,230
Ignatia can be an extrovert or Staphysagria or Nat Muriaticum can be an extrovert?

277
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:30,530
Can be an extrovert Nat Muriaticum?

278
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:37,790
In the way I'm speaking now, you may have an extrovert who doesn't show

279
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:46,120
the mental-emotional affected and you will see from a physical level the problem.

280
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:53,950
Whilst the Nat Muriaticum on a physical level has raised his consciousness,

281
00:47:54,050 --> 00:48:06,700
then the disease started to come inside. The forces destroy his emotional side.

282
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:26,040
Then eventually he learns not to talk, he goes into a room and cries by him/herself.

283
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:30,030
Instead of talking and solving the situation on the spot.

284
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:33,980
That is going to bring problem in mental-emotional level.

285
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:44,090
A Nat Muriaticum can be an extrovert as long as it's not affected in mental-emotional.

286
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:55,840
So when they are affected (?) not expect that everyone who is Nat Mur will have it.

287
00:48:55,940 --> 00:49:01,590
When you see a Nat Mur affected in his physical health,

288
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:04,840
you will see mostly keynote symptoms.

289
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:09,920
You will see the desire for salt. Salt, I like it.

290
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:14,700
Sun no, I don't want it.

291
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:24,550
What time? 10 o'clock.

292
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:38,630
How can I give him Nat Mur? Of course you can give Nat Mur, you have everything there.

293
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:52,300
The mental-emotional is quite in order because he is a successful manager,

294
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,300
he is a successful  businessman.

295
00:49:54,400 --> 00:50:01,160
He doesn't care what it's going to happen, if he makes a bad deal with you,

296
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:05,010
He does not care, he is a businessman.

297
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:28,320
When the disease is coming upwards, then he starts thinking about others.

298
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:31,860
There are two different things which are happening.

299
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:55,160
In order to remain healthy, you have to  be nasty with the society and do whatever you like.

300
00:50:55,260 --> 00:51:02,870
But from another point of view if you have the totality and the real thing,

301
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:10,010
then you say no.

302
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:21,010
You know the American millionaire who destroyed his mind?

303
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:36,090
And they will do anything to get (?) their responses, they are having a severe condition.

304
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:48,250
If she came in contact with a spiritual guru, how she could see differently the world,

305
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:56,500
he was very vital, going with all women. That woman and that woman.

306
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:10,030
You see vital force very strong, very high (?) are there.

307
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:17,000
You see everything showing that he has a good vitality.

308
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:24,120
But from a spiritual point of view, that's not a healthy thing.

309
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:38,250
Destroying the whole society because of his personal winning.

310
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:47,400
So I came down with the wisdom that the happy man was the one that he could strike a path

311
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:55,660
 that whatever you were doing it was good for himself, for his own interest, his own evolution

312
00:52:58,090 --> 00:53:07,230
but his action will have an equal good effect in the society in general.

313
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:15,720
So I'm healthy if what I do has a good effect on you and on me.

314
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:19,770
If it has only on me, I'm unhealthy. If it has only on you, I'm unhealthy.

315
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:34,810
Do you understand that? It goes to other things.

316
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:43,530
That's an unhealthy state. You look after yourself also.

317
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:50,690
That's the golden mean.

318
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:16,540
-You are saying that is in spiritual world, one goes to certain exercises or changes

319
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:26,650
and that there are therefore diseases which come along with spiritual growth?

320
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:35,280
-I won't say it that way. I would say that there are possibilities of disturbances that

321
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:44,870
they may arise as you go on.

322
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:53,700
On mental-emotional.

323
00:54:53,800 --> 00:55:02,700
Usually when you have a person going from the outside world to the inside world,

324
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:14,200
he was an extrovert and now introvert, from acting in the world, acting within himself

325
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:29,360
what you observe usually is that...I have colitis, I have this, that...

326
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:35,870
Unless this is happening really under homeopathic treatment,

327
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:46,460
which I understand it can happen that, most probably this is the arising of the concentration

328
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:58,270
on the level of the disease, diffusion of the disease on a different level.

329
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:03,980
-So you are saying that disease is the process of dispersion?

330
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:18,680
-Diseases are outward manifestation of whatever negative forces are working within us

331
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:22,220
in all levels.

332
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:30,430
The expression of this negativity is within us.

333
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:40,430
Life tends to repair and to bring life in.

334
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:48,030
Disease tends to destroy and to bring death.

335
00:56:53,030 --> 00:57:03,150
The Natrum Carbonicum is not this type we discussed here and we analyzed

336
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:09,520
this mental-emotional situation that this person is in.

337
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:25,220
Therefore that is the obesity, the whole (?) of that girl, how she is vital

338
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:37,490
and that should give as an essence the patient of the Graphites, than anything else.

339
00:57:38,870 --> 00:57:42,290
Also Calcarea Carbonica...

340
00:57:48,890 --> 00:57:53,960
Because of the better heat, Calcarea Carbonica is so much better by warm water,

341
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:57,540
by warm application.

342
00:57:58,970 --> 00:58:07,210
So Calcarea Carbonica or Calcarea Phosphorica, the element of Phosphorus which is there,

343
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:24,780
it gives much more burning in the body.

344
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:38,670
They don't reach to such huge proportions.

345
00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:47,500
That is the context between Graphites and Calcarea Carbonica

346
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,850
and you don't really know which one of the two.

347
00:58:54,950 --> 00:59:01,590
-(?)

348
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:14,430
-It doesn't tell. With the Graphites and the Calcarea Carbonica yes.

349
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:22,260
You see if you have Graphites symptoms or Calcarea Carbonica symptoms.

350
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:27,900
You don't have (?) either Calcarea or Graphites.

351
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:39,310
Then you can go on to Capsicum or can go on to Ferrum or to Kali Bichromicum,

352
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:43,100
Natrum Carbonicum, Opium.

353
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:52,060
Opium is because of the thyroid dysfunction, it becomes quite huge.

354
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:59,320
-(?)

355
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:10,250
-I don't know that. That's a new symptom and we have to find out to which

356
01:00:10,350 --> 01:00:13,200
remedy it belongs.

357
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:20,500
It is a symptom of our modern society, it did not exist by the time.

358
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:33,290
This is a syndrome which has developed in our contemporary society.

359
01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:42,080
And it is a symptom which comes along with particular psychological make up

360
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,840
and we have eventually to find out.

361
01:00:43,940 --> 01:01:00,510
We don't have so many cases in Greece of that type. Here you have a lot but in Greece we don't have

362
01:01:00,610 --> 01:01:06,840
so I was not able to establish what are the remedies that are connected with that syndrome?

363
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:18,430
I don't know. When I look at a case, I may have an idea.

364
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:29,220
I have seen that case quite a lot because I like observing and I see quite a lot.

365
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:40,380
Yesterday I was taking a case of bronchitis.

366
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:47,320
A woman was sitting on the other side (?)

367
01:01:51,820 --> 01:02:02,470
nobody was there but one woman who had a book and she was reading,

368
01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:07,510
she must have been staying there from the time...

369
01:02:07,610 --> 01:02:15,920
It was one hour and still she was sitting...

370
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:29,000
That's what I felt. Now that is a syndrome, introvert completely.

371
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:36,590
Everything in her world was that book. I was observing her from time to time

372
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:50,590
to see if she was sensitive enough to look. That syndrome.

373
01:02:50,690 --> 01:02:56,670
-It was a romantic novel from the library?

374
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:17,750
-I don't know that. What I know is she enjoyed it.

375
01:03:17,850 --> 01:03:23,500
Over eating also comes from the lack of affection.

376
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:30,080
Usually these people are not steady enough with the emotions

377
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:40,500
and they are replacing with something that brings pleasure and this is eating.

378
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:47,420
So usually it is lack of affection, not appreciated.

379
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:53,340
How do we go with over eating? I'm not sure yet.

380
01:03:55,150 --> 01:04:02,010
Bring back the balance.

381
01:04:02,110 --> 01:04:05,920
-Maybe we should do a study.

382
01:04:12,970 --> 01:04:17,130
-We have some cases and they are some successes.

383
01:04:41,930 --> 01:05:03,590
-What are you eating? That's a coarse thing to do. Are you hungry all the time?

384
01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:17,420
You get the information from the figure I saw in the waiting room, the secretary.

385
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:30,670
How joyful she was there. She was so joyful that the second time she came,

386
01:05:30,770 --> 01:05:44,160
my wife...She spoke with much love, with affection, strong emotions.

387
01:05:46,930 --> 01:05:55,290
That is what I mean coarse.

388
01:06:00,350 --> 01:06:10,340
Because after all she likes music, she is a singer, she has a job which she makes quite a lot of.

389
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:36,110
It's interesting from here that she is so much better in colitis by green vegetables.

390
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:45,460
That's the first time I met that syndrome. I just make a note if I meet it again

391
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:48,380
that's very important to see that.

392
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:59,640
Colitis usually is aggravated by that in 99% of the cases. It's a rare exception.

393
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:07,800
We have to take into consideration that.

394
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:24,020
She is aggravated by fat. Graphites has that?
Graphites is not written.

395
01:07:27,270 --> 01:07:34,690
Here we have it strongly and with everything fat.

396
01:07:39,190 --> 01:07:50,510
You make a note. You don't have to add everything.

397
01:08:00,030 --> 01:08:08,930
So we have the disturbances with menses, we have all kind of arthritic rheumatic condition,

398
01:08:09,030 --> 01:08:17,430
which is ameliorated by warm, the person who is aggravated by cold rather than by heat,

399
01:08:17,530 --> 01:08:24,190
the person who has aversion to salt and aversion to sweet,

400
01:08:24,290 --> 01:08:33,850
who is so fat and eats and yet does not like sweets and that's has to become

401
01:08:33,950 --> 01:08:40,520
a symptom for healthy, aversion to sweet.

402
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:48,270
We have to take that into consideration.

403
01:08:48,370 --> 01:08:53,120
And say what is there?

404
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:23,450
Desires company is not in the book. You have it in mind, you put it in.

405
01:09:23,550 --> 01:09:31,790
There is a lot of things which are not put in the Repertory.

406
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:49,620
-I was saying yesterday I never thought I shall be teaching, I never thought to systematise that.

407
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:31,940
-She is young, she is 28 and she is not stressed psychologically so much.

408
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:46,480
To suspect that the blood pressure is high, I have to have the inter-stress that is always there.

409
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:52,660
With her it's easy going.

410
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:59,630
She misses to fall in love...

411
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:16,040
She does not have a partner and always it's going to be some trouble.

412
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:24,760
The second time she came, she said I'm happy.

413
01:11:28,510 --> 01:11:46,660
The last 5-6 days, she had some kind of nausea in the morning.

414
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:53,070
She said continuously I was in a happy mood.

415
01:11:53,170 --> 01:12:04,180
That started after the third dose.

416
01:12:12,690 --> 01:12:25,860
On the last day of the treatment, she had some menses that were very short.

417
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:38,030
Last menses was in November and we see her in January.

418
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:41,530
In spite of the fact she had a stressful situation with her mother she said,

419
01:12:41,630 --> 01:12:45,890
I did not feel the stress this time.

420
01:12:45,990 --> 01:12:52,380
She said in another situation if I was not feeling so well,

421
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:58,970
I would feel rotten if I had that conflict.

422
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:11,810
The pain on the back continued, the pain on the cervical is gone.

423
01:13:13,490 --> 01:13:25,150
-George, is there any suffering from lumbar pains...

424
01:13:25,250 --> 01:13:32,720
-Not myself and I don't think in the Repertory.

425
01:13:32,820 --> 01:13:42,840
-There is a rubric which says it is secondary...

426
01:13:52,380 --> 01:14:09,320
-I would rather tend to think that the over weight is really pressing somewhere between the vertebrae.

427
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:17,210
That's why actually she said that this pain has gone, this pain has remained.

428
01:14:28,060 --> 01:14:34,540
The greasiness on the head is much less.

429
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:46,360
You go to the Repertory, hair greasy and you see there Bryonia, Phosphoric Acid

430
01:14:46,460 --> 01:14:53,320
and Thuja perhaps and Natrum Muriaticum.

431
01:14:53,420 --> 01:15:02,170
You see here how strong is that symptom in Graphites?

432
01:15:02,270 --> 01:15:07,540
Graphites has that kind of reaction on the skin.

433
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:11,840
So we can comfortably insert Graphites in greasy.

434
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:22,000
That is a rubric which has very little. Sulphur also should be there with the greasy hair.

435
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:31,800
She says that there were days that she did not need to eat.

436
01:15:57,530 --> 01:16:15,470
She said that she had that on the 1st of April and the interview is on 14th of January.

437
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:29,190
She said that she had regular menses for 5 days, lost a few kilos.

438
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:43,140
She took up another job.

439
01:16:55,370 --> 01:17:00,110
And of course she gets tired because she doesn't sleep enough.

440
01:17:00,210 --> 01:17:22,260
About the psychological state, she says that I have ups and down and changes in mood.

441
01:17:24,950 --> 01:17:37,440
She had some hoarseness in voice, she thinks that she gets quite tired with this second job,

442
01:17:37,540 --> 01:17:49,390
going the whole night until 2-3 o'clock, then she has to get up at 7 o'clock to go to the other work

443
01:17:49,490 --> 01:17:53,340
and she got quite tired from that.

444
01:17:53,440 --> 01:18:10,760
During the last 15 days, she got an influenza for which she took antibiotics.

445
01:18:13,450 --> 01:18:22,840
The doctors saw her and they said take that. For 4 days she took antibiotics.

446
01:18:28,110 --> 01:18:34,260
What are we going to do?

447
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:40,560
-Wait.

448
01:18:40,660 --> 01:18:49,100
-She took antibiotics, (?) and we try to evaluate what is happening with the body.

449
01:18:52,070 --> 01:19:00,810
You have to wait and see what happens, the body goes up and down and then it goes up.

450
01:19:05,570 --> 01:19:17,620
She was able to throw out the effect of the antibiotics and go up again and that is what has happened.

451
01:19:19,980 --> 01:19:28,130
She needs somebody to talk and tell the story because from now on we just

452
01:19:28,230 --> 01:19:37,960
give placebo to the case.

453
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:42,210
I just want to show you an aspect of Graphites together with new symptomatology

454
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:45,470
which may arise and how we may evaluate and use it.

455
01:19:45,570 --> 01:19:50,020
-How much weight she is losing?

456
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:58,350
-It doesn't seem that the doctors had asked her.

457
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:13,470
She hadn't lose too many, otherwise I would have seen it.

458
01:20:13,570 --> 01:20:25,390
She lost some from the third visit and lost during the menses two kilos.

459
01:20:27,810 --> 01:20:35,460
Eventually she said the whole story to the doctor, how the father used to hit her mother

460
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:45,280
and used to hit her and how she had lack of affection.

461
01:20:47,550 --> 01:20:52,780
-Did it seem at the time of her parents separation...?

462
01:20:52,880 --> 01:21:01,630
-No, the parents had been separated quite early, at the age of 3.

463
01:21:01,730 --> 01:21:09,100
It was quite a stress for her to see them, the father was a drunkard.

464
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:15,860
He hit the mother and he hit the child. She gave the whole story later.

465
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:21,690
She became intimate with the doctor and gave that information of what happened

466
01:21:21,790 --> 01:21:26,600
in her previous years.

467
01:21:31,460 --> 01:21:37,020
It's a matter of information.

468
01:21:38,540 --> 01:21:44,420
-George I'm just wondering in your experience...

469
01:21:50,600 --> 01:22:00,120
-I have not seen dramatic changes taking place in these obese children.

470
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:10,500
Sometimes you will see quite a good response but not dramatic.

471
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:18,200
What I have seen now that within a limit of time in 3-4 years,

472
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:30,750
they are able to do a diet and stick with a diet and eventually lose weight.

473
01:22:30,850 --> 01:22:38,790
But I have not seen that dramatic change happening with the remedy.

474
01:22:38,890 --> 01:22:45,920
-You mean you don't see it immediately but you see it in a long run?

475
01:22:46,020 --> 01:22:51,200
-You see it in a long run, they have to go with a kind of fast, of diet to lose it

476
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:53,750
and then they lose it more easily.

477
01:22:53,850 --> 01:23:03,520
Sometimes they will say I used to do this diet and not lose anything and now I lose.

478
01:23:03,620 --> 01:23:11,940
-How about the attitude that somebody is having a  treatment and they are doing very well

479
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:22,340
and then they develop a weight problem? That's very common in my practice.

480
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:26,930
That means they had a weight problem in the past. Do you find that in your experience?

481
01:23:27,030 --> 01:23:31,190
-That seems that there are several categories.

482
01:23:31,290 --> 01:23:41,800
The ones who had weight problem always. Calcarea carbonica.

483
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:58,880
Then secondly it's when they come with a lot of stress and excitement

484
01:23:58,980 --> 01:24:06,170
and there is a situation that makes the person burning a lot.

485
01:24:06,270 --> 01:24:17,250
And you bring it back to the normal and he is calm, he copes better with a situation.

486
01:24:17,350 --> 01:24:25,330
Now that is the time where he has to be aware.

487
01:24:25,430 --> 01:24:30,830
The amount of food that he has learned that he can eat without any effect,

488
01:24:30,930 --> 01:24:38,280
it has to be lessened now.

489
01:24:38,380 --> 01:24:45,830
-The Calcarea would you say that (?)

490
01:24:45,930 --> 01:25:03,280
-It can do that. Usually what happens is that within 2 months, they may put on weight.

491
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:18,150
What I feel is that our society is structured in such a way, as to push food in us.

492
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:43,080
I'm used to that.

493
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:49,420
It's another situation that you give in.

494
01:25:53,020 --> 01:26:05,700
It's not the remedy or the treatment. It's the situation which we call ourselves.

495
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:14,000
When there is advertisement for food on a bucket, you don't have to do anything.

496
01:26:15,350 --> 01:26:33,650
Cooked already, ready for the oven, just put it there and eat it with saucages inside and green things.

497
01:26:33,750 --> 01:26:40,150
That's why we develop more and more food diseases.

498
01:26:46,830 --> 01:26:58,460
Stop. This has to be understood.

499
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:03,520
Diseases now they come from over eating.
