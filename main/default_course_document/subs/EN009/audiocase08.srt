1
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:38,210
-She is 47 and she has psoriasis and I think psoriatic arthritis of the hand and feet,

2
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:46,210
she has sleeplessness, she is exhausted and she has very bad migraines.

3
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:52,710
She has since five years thrombophlebitis.

4
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:05,460
This has this psoriasis since the 9th year generalized.

5
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:19,560
As a child she had measles, chicken pox, rubella.

6
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:29,330
She had vaccination poliomyelitis, diphtheria, small pox...

7
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:47,660
She has arthritis since the 17th year of the hand and the ankles, small finger

8
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:59,240
and since the 16th she got cortisone therapy inside and outside.

9
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,080
-She is still taking cortisone?
-No.

10
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:13,480
She got Sepia from a homeopath which had no effect, she changed it to another Homeopath

11
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:23,830
and she got Rhododendron which was a success because she did not need her voltaren.

12
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,990
She did not need to take any anti-rheumatics.

13
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,970
-So she has psoriatic arthritis.

14
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:55,550
-Now at the time she had appendectomy in 1959 and a duodenal ulcer in 1987.

15
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:21,260
In 1967 she married and in 1971 her son was born.

16
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,180
That was after she had slept the first time with her husband.

17
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:32,070
-For three years she did not sleep with her husband?

18
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:37,450
-No, she married him because he accepted her disease.

19
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:44,920
The skin disease and he was something like a father for her.

20
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:56,220
Then later after the son she started to have some interest in sexuality and she had

21
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:04,150
a love affair that was early disappointed and later she had some other love affairs.

22
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,550
Now she has come here with her friend.

23
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:11,980
-With her boyfriend but she is not married anymore?

24
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:19,730
-They are now separated.

25
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:27,650
-They live separated.
-Yes now she lives with her son alone.

26
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:50,820
In night she gets palpitations and fear and then she runs about it doesn't get better, it gets better by that.

27
00:04:55,230 --> 00:05:00,640
Sometimes she has something that she feels that she is unreal,

28
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,470
that she doesn't have contact to the floor.

29
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:22,980
With her new friend she says that she doesn't love him very much

30
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:31,730
because he is too closed, she would like to have deep feelings.

31
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:47,880
When she was 1 1/2 year old when she went in the street she was stroke

32
00:05:47,980 --> 00:06:04,480
by her mother and she did not dare to go out of the house for one and a half year.

33
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,710
-What remedy she has received?

34
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:26,310
-She has received more remedies and when she came she got Pulsatilla.

35
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,470
-What other remedies she had in the mean time?

36
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:32,820
-I don't know.

37
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,540
-She does not know?

38
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:42,400
-Maybe she knows, she told us about Sepia and Rhododendron and then she got Pulsatilla.

39
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:53,540
She could sleep for 14 days and she felt quite well and the skin became very bad;

40
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:59,620
then the sleeplessness came back, the exhaustion and all that.

41
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,120
-You repeated Pulsatilla?

42
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:21,050
-No. It was too short, I didn't do the initial treatment.

43
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,800
-What potency?
-1M.

44
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:42,340
Her father had psoriasis and died at 66 from heart, asthma.

45
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:50,760
Her mother had gallbladder and digestive tract disease and she is living,

46
00:07:53,760 --> 00:08:02,500
the grandfather of the father had cancer of the stomach

47
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:07,020
and the grand grandmother was very arteriosclerotic.

48
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,740
-Anything else?

49
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:34,730
-I can tell you more but this was why we prescribed Pulsatilla.

50
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:49,000
One thing that came out for some time that the skin was better when she had shower.

51
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,390
-The skin better when she had hot shower always?

52
00:08:53,490 --> 00:09:00,240
-No, for some time after she had Pulsatilla. I don't know the actual state.

53
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,170
-She speaks English well?

54
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:11,160
-She speaks English but she is not used in speaking.

55
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:15,410
I can give you some more symptomatology.

56
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,730
-I would like her to come in.

57
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:26,480
If she forgets, according to your symptoms, she does not mention anything then we can add it,

58
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,570
I would like to hear the story from herself.

59
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:45,080
By this introduction that we had in the case, we more or less know the character of the person.

60
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:51,720
We have enough information. When she was one and a half year old, the mother smacked her

61
00:09:51,820 --> 00:10:02,810
because she went out of the house and for one and a half year she didn't go out of the house again.

62
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,980
It is important.

63
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:18,150
She married with a man and only slept with him once when her skin was better.

64
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,310
-No.

65
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,800
-What did you understand?

66
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:44,230
Oh she didn't say that. Anyhow she slept with him once after three years.

67
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:57,550
So you perceive the kind of person, this fact indicates very much the type of the person we have.

68
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:03,550
What type of person we have?
-Very sensitive.

69
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:20,150
-Very sensitive, who can be hurt very easily. Let's see.

70
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:37,960
Are you ready? Do you know what other remedies did you have except of Rhododendron,

71
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:47,070
Sepia and Pulsatilla?
-Sepia and Rhus tox.

72
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,120
-You had more remedies?
-Yes.

73
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:31,190
-But you don't remember the names? Have you written them down?

74
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:34,690
-Yes I wrote in the paper.

75
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:37,790
-The paper is not there.

76
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,040
What is the impression she is giving you?
-Shy.

77
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:06,140
-Very nervous.
-...

78
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,020
-Sad.

79
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:22,370
-What is the main thing is, it seems as if?
-Restlessness.

80
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,780
-Desperate.
-No energy.

81
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,110
-Embarrassed.
-She is not clear in her mind.

82
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:43,710
-She is not clear in her mind, hazy, I ask questions like what remedies did you take...

83
00:14:47,960 --> 00:15:00,120
There is no clearness in her mind. Why the mind is not clear? She is too shy,

84
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:05,520
she can not remember... What is the remedy that you think first?

85
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,270
-Alumina.

86
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:19,530
-But timidity is strong, Staphysagria, Silicea, Baryta carbonica.

87
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:39,110
You can think of Bar-c. as a first impression because you can

88
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:54,690
say that she is too shy to show to her husband her disease, to undress and too afraid

89
00:15:54,790 --> 00:16:01,520
because the mother smacked her and stayed in the house for one year without daring to go out.

90
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:34,450
-very short experiences and I forgot.

91
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:50,590
-Can you tell me how it developed? You have psoriasis? When you were nine years old

92
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:55,450
or since nine years?
-When I was nine years old.

93
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:05,850
-And you remember anything happened at that time? Your mother separated?

94
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:12,680
-My grandmother died three months before.

95
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:26,270
-And you were connected very much?
-Yes I suffered very much. I was connected with her.

96
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:37,110
-Much more than your actual parents?
-Yes in a way.

97
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,610
-You were connected more with your mother, father?

98
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:48,200
-With my father but the grandmother was the mother of my mother.

99
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:55,690
-And your father was very good to you?
-Yes.

100
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:58,690
-Your mother?

101
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:11,840
You see the difference? I say your father was good to you? Yes and your mother?...

102
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:19,600
There is a difference, perhaps there is a big difference, the mother smacked her severely

103
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,920
that's why the child stayed there.

104
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:27,170
In these cases we have the syndrome the mother being jealous of the daughter

105
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,670
and the father replacing the mother by the daughter.

106
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:37,930
Taking out the daughter to go to the cinema and the mother stays in the house.

107
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:44,890
Then there is a complex there which develops a lot of ill feelings for woman,

108
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:50,840
a lot of resentment and lack of self confidence in herself.

109
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:55,180
They can stay without much self confidence in the rest of their lives.

110
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:04,400
We have been thinking of Baryta carbonica so far, have we confirmed the Bar. carb.?

111
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,640
-No.

112
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:12,390
-No, because she gives answers quite correct and she is right there,

113
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:20,650
she is not really hazy in her mind or what appeared to be hazy in the beginning.

114
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:31,990
-Your mother?
-It is complicated.

115
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:34,280
-Why?

116
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:48,280
-She was not very happy in her life and connected to my father.

117
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,140
-Why?

118
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:58,370
You see they won't give the problem immediately. Her problem is not that the mother

119
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,790
was not in a good relationship with the father.

120
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:05,790
Her problem, if there is any problem because of that, is that the mother

121
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:09,970
did not have a good relationship with her.

122
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:19,550
-It's a long story.

123
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,210
-Can you make it short?

124
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:45,040
-Yes, her first fiancé died and after she married my father...

125
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,890
-Not because of love?
-Yes I think so.

126
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:53,680
-And that's why they had problems all the time?
-Yes.

127
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:04,760
So now it is absolutely sure that the father did not get response from the mother,

128
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:10,090
did not get enough affection from her, therefore she is going to get affection from the daughter.

129
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:13,940
Therefore the mother will start being jealous of the daughter.

130
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:35,590
-And there was a kind of jealousness from her side.

131
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:46,100
-About you? Because your father liked you?
-Liked me and took me out more than her.

132
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:57,020
-And so she was vicious to you?
-Not obviously.

133
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,940
-Underlined.
-Yes.

134
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:09,620
What you observe now through this questioning? How is the character coming up?

135
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:18,020
I want to know what it came out eventually and I asked but she does not bring that.

136
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,770
She said other things instead.

137
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:28,510
What kind of character will do that?
-Closed.

138
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:39,770
-Closed and a character...
-Ignatia and Natrum mur.

139
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:47,440
-Not only these remedies. It is something that concerns her.

140
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:52,760
I said what is your relationship with your mother? And she does not tell me.

141
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,770
She knows exactly what is the relationship but she does not tell me.

142
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:03,020
Therefore she wants to cover up the mother. She says never mind, forget it, it is a long story.

143
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,010
What is the long story? Well my mother was in love and then she married...

144
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:15,180
-What is further on that? Then I almost tell the story instead of her

145
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,510
but she wants to cover up the situation.

146
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,850
It is not a vicious character. It is a character that wants to cover up.

147
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:39,950
This happened, I understand. I don't want to offend somebody.

148
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:50,850
It's a very sensitive person, tremendously sensitive and the fact that she had suffered so much

149
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:54,050
made her over sensitive.

150
00:23:54,150 --> 00:24:00,510
To have a problem that is so deep, also esthetic problem for a woman is terrible

151
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,870
to have it from nine years old.

152
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:24,940
-She suffered about this skin disease. She often said that her fault to have a child

153
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:30,680
with such skin problem.

154
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,650
-Do you have brothers or sisters?
-One brother.

155
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,100
-Did he have any problem?

156
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:42,700
-No problem. He is two years younger than me.

157
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:55,710
-Why your mother said that it is her fault that you have the skin problem?

158
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:04,350
-It was her idea, no reason.

159
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:10,600
-Your father had psoriasis, the same thing?

160
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:20,260
-Yes but very little. Only there, only sometimes.

161
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:28,270
-Why your mother said it was her fault? Because she married your father who had psoriasis

162
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:32,020
and then she had a child with psoriasis? Is that the reason?

163
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:57,020
-No, it was not conscious to her. After I had the disease the possibility was there

164
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:06,620
that it was my father's fault but he had never treatment, it was so little.

165
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:13,690
-After psoriasis you developed sleeplessness or migraines?

166
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:19,200
Can you give me the history how it developed? Just give me an idea.

167
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,510
Nine years you had psoriasis.

168
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:26,770
Then they took you to doctors, they put creams, you took cortisone?

169
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,270
-Yes.

170
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:41,010
-Then what happened next?
-Next point was at 17 years and my bones ache.

171
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:48,260
-Your bones, your joints?
-The tooth.

172
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:53,120
-They started deformities on the toes?
-Yes.

173
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:16,940
-This pain started at the age of 17 and while the psoriasis was better or while the psoriasis

174
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:21,170
was still very bad?
-Still very bad.

175
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:23,840
-And the pain started?

176
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:53,810
-Yes. Also pain in the wrist and in that bone and the neck is also damaged.

177
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:14,310
-Osteoarthritis?
-Yes.

178
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:18,620
-It's not an accident?

179
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:27,940
-At 17 years first the feet and then the neck and then the wrist.

180
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:37,410
-And then you took other medicines for this? Pain killers?

181
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:58,980
-Yes and other cortisone things. Later on Voltaren.

182
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:08,480
-Then what happened? How it developed?

183
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:35,550
-At the age of 24 I started a treatment in a skin clinic up to the North Sea,

184
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:54,050
a climate treatment and from that time I did it every year and the skin was really for 3-4 months

185
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:56,800
it was good.

186
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:06,640
-What treatment it was? With lights?
-With light and with Cignolin.

187
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:18,650
-The basis is petroleum?

188
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:27,650
So for 3-4 months while you were there psoriasis was better?

189
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,400
-Yes.

190
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:40,730
-Then what happened?
-Then a new soup followed.

191
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:50,000
-In 3-4 months she fell back.
-Yes but not so heavy.

192
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:16,430
I went on for years that way until two years ago from now it was bearable.

193
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,310
-The pains and the psoriasis?

194
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:30,810
-Yes but in the meantime I had the treatment with homeopathic things because of the

195
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:39,410
bones, only of the bones, he never treated the skin. He concentrated on the bone pain.

196
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,050
-And you had Sepia and other remedies.

197
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:58,390
-Yes and two years ago I started with migraines.

198
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:01,740
-What kind of migraines?

199
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:24,570
-It starts with a bad feeling all over the body and in the stomach I feel nausea

200
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:56,820
and I feel cold all over the body and there is a pressure in the head and vertigo.

201
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:11,380
Vertigo that I don't feel sure on my feet, sometimes that's all and sometimes

202
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:20,480
it's followed by a terrible headache, sometimes right, sometimes left.

203
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:29,120
-Where is most of the times right or left?
-Right mostly.

204
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:41,220
-Or is it one time left, next right, left, right?
-I can't say it.

205
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:50,790
So far with all this symptomatology she is talking about the only thing we understand

206
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:55,540
is the sequence of events, what took place in her organism which shows the progress

207
00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:01,390
of the disease on deeper and deeper levels.

208
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:12,290
We do not get an information about the remedy. What she says does not give us the least

209
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:21,130
conclusion of what the remedy might be, in spite of the fact that we have a lot of pathology.

210
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,130
Is anybody who knows the remedy?

211
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:50,980
-Then the severe pains come? How is the pain?

212
00:34:54,470 --> 00:35:15,980
-The pain is stitching, more often this pressure feeling.

213
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:28,330
-It stays on one side or it goes from one side to other side?

214
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:32,910
-It starts here in the neck and goes there.

215
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:37,900
-To the occipital protuberance. Either left or right?

216
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:47,910
-Always left, it goes all over the head and then for one hour it is painful all over the head

217
00:35:48,010 --> 00:36:02,260
and then it decides to go either to the left or to the right.

218
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,400
-But it always starts on the left occipital protuberance.

219
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,000
-Yes.

220
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,930
-How long it lasts all together?

221
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:31,170
-It is different, sometimes one day, one night, sometimes two, three days.

222
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:54,800
In the beginning two years ago it was only once in a month connected with my menses.

223
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:55,550
-Before menses?

224
00:36:55,650 --> 00:37:06,980
-Before menses and during menses. Now it is more often.

225
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:59,560
-During the headache you have to lie down?
-Sometimes yes because of the nausea...

226
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:05,150
Weakness.

227
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:15,130
-When the weakness started, the weakness comes only during headache or you have weakness...

228
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:23,630
-Before the headaches starts.

229
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:26,130
-Three years ago you had weakness?

230
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:43,440
-I always had problems with my blood circulation and weakness

231
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:46,440
-Did you ever had vertigo with headache?

232
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:54,790
-Before the pains begun I had often weakness attacks.

233
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:19,440
-When the weakness started?
-I think all over my life it was, 10 years old.

234
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:26,870
-You still remember you were very exhausted?
-Yes but not as much as now.

235
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:31,460
-Now you are very exhausted?
-Yes.

236
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:38,960
-Your father is still alive?
-No.

237
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:45,800
-When he died?
-He died six years ago.

238
00:39:47,540 --> 00:40:06,700
-Did you have a big grief when he died?
-Yes in one way but for him it was good I think.

239
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,440
-Why?
-He was ill, suffering.

240
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:28,280
-On what?
-On heart asthma and he died very suddenly.

241
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:40,020
-Did you cry when he died?
-Yes.

242
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:53,520
-A lot or very little?
-I was very sad a long time.

243
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:59,520
-Yes sad but did you cry?
-A little.

244
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,860
-Or not at all?
-Not at all.

245
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:07,760
-You were sad and not crying?
-Yes.

246
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:18,510
-You wanted to cry? You couldn't cry?
-I cried a little, not too much.

247
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:22,610
-Generally you cry a lot?

248
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:35,030
-I cry more the older I get. When I was young I cried little or not at all and now I cry more.

249
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:39,860
-Can you describe your character?

250
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:46,360
Is she going to describe her character?
-No.

251
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:57,010
-Never mind how hard you try. She always go around, not because she does not want.

252
00:41:57,110 --> 00:42:04,510
It is almost impossible to say deep things which are happening, why?

253
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:07,630
Because this kind of people are so sensitive,

254
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:12,380
they are afraid to come up and expose themselves.

255
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:22,060
It is like taking the skin and it is very painful. Let us see what she says.

256
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:42,310
-That's difficult. I try.

257
00:42:46,310 --> 00:43:02,310
I think as a child I was very calm and introverted and now I am more open.

258
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:15,200
She thinks she is more open now. What is interested for us to observe is how a child

259
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:19,200
becomes calm and introverted.

260
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:30,800
How the environment will shape a lot of the child. What is the environment?

261
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:45,620
A father who married a woman who does not love him but she married him to have a husband

262
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,470
and to have a child.

263
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:57,220
The mother had in her mind the boyfriend that she lost, the love affair who died.

264
00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:03,370
Most probably she never gave any real affection to the husband.

265
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:10,860
This coldness in between the couple is going to be transmitted into the understanding

266
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:17,040
of the child and the child lives in an environment where there is no real love, real affection.

267
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:20,130
No love and affection is expressed.

268
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:40,280
Further than this complex we have the mother not liking the husband,

269
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:49,780
she does not bring out her nature.

270
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:56,640
The nature of woman is love, the nature of man is wisdom!

271
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:22,550
Symbolically men supposed to be more wise, women supposed to be more loving.

272
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:26,380
Every one of us have both love and wisdom, don't worry.

273
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:30,640
Especially you, you are full of love and wisdom.

274
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:36,460
About love I don't have any objection. Wisdom...?

275
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:46,130
Symbolically this is the nature of woman, accepted or not.

276
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:53,210
When the woman gives love it feels at best, it feels she is fulfilling her function.

277
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:58,820
Now she cannot fulfill her function because she does not give love

278
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:04,250
and the child remains closed, remote ,calm, closed.

279
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:11,980
What is happening is the grandmother who comes into the picture and replaces the love

280
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,760
that the mother does not give into the daughter.

281
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:23,510
That is why the shock is so great for the daughter when the grandmother dies.

282
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:32,900
The shock is tremendous when the grandmother dies because the affection is not there

283
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:40,940
and the child finds the affection only in the grandmother and she is attached to her

284
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:52,240
but without speaking. It is an inward affection that she keeps to the grandmother. Why?

285
00:46:52,340 --> 00:47:00,500
The child has not learned to speak emotions. Because emotions are not positive,

286
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:06,240
when emotions are not positive, you say I'm so angry, it's better not to talk.

287
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:10,350
It is like that, when you have a negative emotion it is better not to talk.

288
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:16,400
When the emotions are positive they are expressed and this is the nature

289
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:22,400
of positive emotions, they will be expressed, the others will perceive them.

290
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,900
The others will also perceive the negative emotions.

291
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:31,710
So that's why when the grandmother dies is a big shock.

292
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:37,400
This we can explain, we can understand now what took place in the heart of the child

293
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:44,610
by saying the whole story. She does not tell the whole story, she does not tell details

294
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:48,810
but we can imagine the details with the family, the structure.

295
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:54,310
Why do we have to understand all that? We have to understand for different reasons.

296
00:47:54,410 --> 00:48:02,570
Because you are dealing with her disease and how... in an environment like this,

297
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:06,920
you can predict that the child will go this or that way.

298
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:13,050
And then you need this for the analysis to understand the remedy for that child.

299
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:17,820
What is the remedy? It must be a sensitive child who understands what is going on,

300
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:23,550
who gets attached to the grandmother, who doesn't talk, who understands the jealousy

301
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:27,790
of the mother, who smacked by the mother and never goes out,

302
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:31,890
then you have the construction of the character.

303
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:39,050
Otherwise you are going to find it difficult to prescribe for this case.

304
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:41,900
You have enough information? No.

305
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:58,390
-You consider yourself now an open person?
-Yes, I think.

306
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:12,930
-You can't talk about your problems with others?
-Yes, I can, I've learned.

307
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:18,020
-How you learned? By psychotherapy?
-Yes.

308
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:27,430
You see how much she is in a hurry? How you learned? The idea is shall I tell now?

309
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:36,480
You see? I did psychotherapy and shall I tell? She tries to find the way to tell without telling.

310
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,230
-And there they taught you to talk?

311
00:49:57,730 --> 00:50:01,220
How long you did psychotherapy?
-Four years.

312
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:03,220
-What kind of psychotherapy?

313
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:17,490
-It was analysis of Jungian dream work through painting.

314
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:27,640
-And so you consider now yourself much more open?

315
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:31,380
-Yes I got more self-confidence.

316
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:36,740
-You had very great lack of self-confidence before?
-Yes I think.

317
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:48,260
-What would you do? Can you give an example?

318
00:50:48,730 --> 00:51:01,980
-I'd stay at home, too frightened to leave home to do the shopping.

319
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:08,240
What are the symptoms, they are coming back again to which remedy?

320
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:16,490
Baryta carbonica. Too timid, she does not want to go out of the house.

321
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:29,990
-The husband had to do the shopping.

322
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:51,140
-All these things my husband did for me because he saw my trouble and my diseases

323
00:51:51,240 --> 00:52:01,490
and he always said I do all the things for you. You lie down and rest.

324
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:09,730
-So you were lying down and resting and he did everything for you.

325
00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:21,880
-I had no job and I did very few things in the house.

326
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:24,630
-Why? You were lazy?

327
00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:44,990
-No because I felt ill, exhausted and frightened that I would not succeed.

328
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:53,390
-Even cooking?

329
00:52:53,490 --> 00:53:15,800
-Cooking I did sometimes but not very much. Later on I left my husband

330
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:28,820
and I did that psychotherapy and a lot changed in my life.

331
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:40,810
-What changed?
-One little thing I took driving license.

332
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:53,050
I never dared before. That was the first feasible thing I did.

333
00:53:54,560 --> 00:54:00,630
-You did something. And then?
-Then I drove a car myself.

334
00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:06,210
-Then you felt more confident?
-Yes.

335
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:15,740
-And what else you did? You got another husband?
-No but another friend.

336
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:28,660
-Boyfriend?
-Yes he was an elder man, not a boy.

337
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:41,060
I live together with him for six years and I work in his praxis.

338
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:53,170
He is a doctor and I was his patient.

339
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:20,170
-Then what else you did? Then you left him also?
-He left me and I was very down, very depressed.

340
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:31,730
-That time you felt that you wanted to kill yourself?
-Yes but I have a son together with my husband.

341
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:39,250
That is the time we may think of a remedy. Which remedy?

342
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:42,240
-Natrum sulphuricum.

343
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:47,220
-In which case you may thing of Natrum sulphuricum?

344
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:55,830
If she says that there was a constant battle inside me between killing myself and living.

345
00:55:56,860 --> 00:56:06,080
In that case alone with constant battle. Immediately we have to clarify that issue.

346
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:19,980
-I think if I hadn't him...

347
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:25,830
-You would have killed you.
-I think, I don't know.

348
00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:32,490
One who wants to prescribe Natrum sulphuricum here we see what she said.

349
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:37,320
She said it but it's not the whole truth.

350
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:51,520
What I'm teaching you to hear, a person says I'm afraid, another person says I'm afraid

351
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:58,720
and a third person says I'm afraid or the same person says I'm afraid three times

352
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:05,240
and it might be totally different in intensity and in what he means.

353
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:16,890
The first time I'm afraid and there is real fright, the second time he says I'm afraid

354
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:21,640
and the third time he says I'm afraid, it's different.

355
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:26,150
But he says the word, he's afraid, it doesn't matter.

356
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:28,190
With intensity you don't expect to hear...

357
00:57:28,290 --> 00:57:38,290
She said I would kill myself if I didn't have the boy, therefore I give her Nat-s.

358
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:44,720
I don't think this is the case. You say but she said it.

359
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:50,310
I don't think this is the case. Let us see.

360
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:56,560
-I think, I don't know but...

361
00:58:05,570 --> 00:58:19,320
After the child...  that's the same time when my migraines started.

362
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:24,710
-Two years ago?
-Yes.

363
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:39,210
Not at once but in a few months. I had to change work, to change house and all my life changed,

364
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:41,820
to look for a new doctor.

365
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:25,290
-So by the time that he left you and you wanted to kill yourself,

366
00:59:25,390 --> 00:59:28,780
the only thing that kept you was your son?
-Yes I think so.

367
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:35,030
-Did you have a big battle inside you to kill yourself and then you say no,

368
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:37,780
let's not do it and then again.

369
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:40,790
There was a big battle inside?
-No.

370
00:59:40,890 --> 00:59:43,530
-Just some thoughts?
-Yes.

371
00:59:43,630 --> 00:59:45,530
-Very short time?
-Very short time.

372
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:52,880
Do you see the difference? Do you see the real facts? These are the real facts.

373
00:59:54,880 --> 01:00:02,040
We have to be aware of what is going on, don't stick on words, stick on the truth

374
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,390
of what is really happening.

375
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:13,860
-Don't we have enough symptoms for Nat. mur.? Every time she has a grief...

376
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:22,610
-Yes and the real grieves are two. The one time with the grandmother

377
01:00:22,710 --> 01:00:25,120
and the other time with her lover.

378
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:31,970
These are the two times when she has real grief and the disease is pushed inside.

379
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:36,970
It goes to another level, it becomes much worse.

380
01:00:39,470 --> 01:00:43,240
-Ignatia?
-Ignatia is a possibility.

381
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:48,000
We are considering Ignatia as well, we are considering Nat. mur.,

382
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:50,130
we are considering Staphysagria.

383
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:08,500
What it depicts this mouth in comparison with the mouth that we spoke about the boy?

384
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,610
What is the difference?

385
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:18,240
She has artificial teeth?
-Yes.

386
01:01:28,350 --> 01:01:37,510
-The upper part of the teeth.
-I don't know, we can ask her.

387
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:57,910
What I want to give you my impression if we compare the two mouths.

388
01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:10,520
This mouth shows determination, shows power, the other shows weakness, degeneration.

389
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:18,490
That face the degeneration is quite on a deep level, here the degeneration

390
01:02:18,590 --> 01:02:23,500
is on a physical level only, it is not so much on mental-emotional.

391
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:27,840
She is very closed but still she is coping emotionally.
