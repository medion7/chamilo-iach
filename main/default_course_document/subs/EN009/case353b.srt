1
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:29,710
-OK, we start and she must remind us what was the problem.

2
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,470
She got Calc. phos.?

3
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:47,540
-I took Calc. phos. C12 for quite some time and till Christmas I went up to C200,

4
00:00:52,280 --> 00:01:03,960
that means I took once C30 and once C200 and twice I smelled it.

5
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,280
-So what was the reaction?

6
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,700
-In the midst of December I was psychologically really doing very well.

7
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,350
I only took the remedy when here, right on my back in the middle part,

8
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:24,200
it was like my spine was closing up.

9
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:31,430
Then I felt terrible fear, my head has no more blood circulation

10
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,700
and always in moment like this I took the remedy and it quickly helped.

11
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,100
-When she started taking the remedy?

12
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:49,260
-I was here in September but in June I started taking the remedy a C12 once the week.

13
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:05,920
-And then she came here on September ...

14
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:13,070
-And then you said that I don't need the remedy at all, what I need is just a very deep crying

15
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,170
because it was always connecting with the death of my mother and my father.

16
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:24,510
-But I suggested Calc. phos. 30 or 200?

17
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:29,590
-You didn't suggest anything, you told me that I should know when to take it.

18
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:38,380
-From September now to December she took it several times?

19
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,930
-Yes, I took C30 and C200 and I smelled in addition twice the C200.

20
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,320
And during that time in the beginning of December I was feeling that I get a heart attack

21
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:57,090
and I get a stroke and my system was totally upset but it was just on the physical plane.

22
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:06,580
It took me two months up to December to find out that Calc. phos.

23
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,180
has something to do with discontent.

24
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:19,280
Getting this idea I was trying to find out and look up all the discontentment in my life.

25
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:25,110
And I found out that all my life I have been really basically discontented

26
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:33,610
and it was just by very strong religious education that I had covered this up all the time.

27
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,780
I didn't even realize it, perceive it anymore.

28
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:41,690
And this with Calc. phos. really got to my awareness.

29
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:48,780
I had a little flu and like always with me I didn't have any fever

30
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:55,510
and that was when this changing between Calcarea and phosphorica started to come up.

31
00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:02,030
After these three days of being all alone at home, I was not even able to go out on the street

32
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:07,360
and meet other people because all the impulses would directly go through me.

33
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:15,370
It was really like everything, advertising, forms and colors would really like fall into me.

34
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:20,700
-When it was that?
-That was around the beginning of December.

35
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:28,700
Then I was told that my father had sold the house without letting me know

36
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,310
and now the tears come.

37
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,680
-The house belonged to him or to her mother?

38
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:46,170
-Belonged to him but after the death of my mother, I tried to project my feeling

39
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,110
of being at home to this house.

40
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:01,370
That was like an intermediate step for me to get along with my father again.

41
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:08,520
And then gradually I cleaned and cleared the house, just piece after piece,

42
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:15,260
I took out all the belongings of my mother and I always had the feeling and I asked myself,

43
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,430
I really wondered, am I going mad now because I had the impression that what I did

44
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:26,780
I had to save these things for my father.

45
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:34,350
This is just what I wanted to stress that even at this time when I had to clear the house,

46
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:40,700
taking everything out, I already had the feeling I had to save things for my father.

47
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:45,600
At the end of April the house had to be totally clean

48
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:50,030
and my brother made the moving of the things.

49
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:58,040
My brother would throw away everything that any respect could be of any value for my father.

50
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,180
So family situation before had been like such.

51
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:08,180
I had practically no contact to my brother, very difficult contact to my father

52
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,780
and a very good relationship to my mother.

53
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:18,600
And since my mother died, my father and me were both like little kids, like little children

54
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:23,430
and my brother just whatever he thinks of, he just does what he wants.

55
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:30,010
He just decides what is going to happen with all these things and both of us,

56
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:33,450
my father and me were standing there hopelessly.

57
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,420
My father meanwhile had been to the hospital and I was always driving to

58
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,350
and from and physically I was completely rag.

59
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,700
She lives in Berlin and her father in Munich, as far as I understood.

60
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:54,170
So every week was 100 km by car. Then my hands started burning, I got slight inflammation

61
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:57,360
of my tendons in the lower arm.

62
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:01,350
-She is driving with the car herself or she goes by train?

63
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:02,750
-By car.

64
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:07,190
-That means she drives for 12 hours?
-6 hours each way.

65
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:17,440
-Still I have not understood whether she likes her father?

66
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:21,590
Why she goes every weekend in the moment she does not like him.

67
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,780
-It completely changed after the death of my mother.

68
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,170
-So she feels connected?

69
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,770
-And I have the feeling that I have to help him.

70
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:37,360
-He is now in the hospital?
-Now he is at home.

71
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,180
-What was the problem with her father?

72
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:50,680
-He had a pulse of 33 bits per minute, both cardio valves weren't functioning well anymore.

73
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:57,360
He had ulcers on his legs, edemas on his legs, so going up to the heart.

74
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:05,690
And she said before I now feel towards my father like I've been feeling before for 6 years

75
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:12,360
for my mother. Like she is helpless and I have to support her.

76
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:19,940
-Where does she attribute these pains? To a lot of driving, to over exertion?

77
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:25,940
-Driving a car I quickly learned even to repertorize, while I'm driving.

78
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:32,520
I was imagining the patients, had a piece of paper next to me and then let it pass through

79
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:39,760
my inner eye  and just make notes and I had better ideas than when I was sitting at my desk.

80
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:44,610
At home I would do the repertorization again and mostly it was fine.

81
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:52,260
At that time I was working 3 days in Berlin and 4 days per week I was staying in Munich,

82
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:58,750
so I had really to be very busy within these 3 days because I had to do the work of 5 days

83
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:11,830
and I was working like paragraph 291 and worked and examined on every patient,

84
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:21,350
on the physical plane, like I would feel all the muscles, I really over exerted my tendons

85
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,850
and had these pains.

86
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:30,910
And all these impulses I got from the patients, they fell right into me.

87
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:37,670
It was like all electrical impulses falling into me and one day there were two spots

88
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:46,750
on my right breast and within hours they were heating up like Berberis and I had the feeling like,

89
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:56,110
as if within hours, they were developing hot spots, hot nodules.

90
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:00,500
On that week I went to see a participant of the course

91
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,410
and she gave me Phosphorus LM 6 three times

92
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:12,120
and one week later I would take a Q12 and everything was gone.

93
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:19,710
And another thing that comes up when I'm so over exerted is that when I overdo myself

94
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:33,420
I feel these burning meninges, which is due to a meningitis which I had years ago.

95
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:42,680
And this feeling of the meningitis like it had been at that time came again now about 4 weeks ago.

96
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:47,180
And it's still there, in between intermediate, I have the feeling that

97
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:54,020
I only can have my neck pulled back and everything is stiff going downwards.

98
00:10:54,530 --> 00:11:00,030
This is now the state of affairs which after Phosphorus is somehow balanced.

99
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:08,670
-So if ask what are the symptoms at the moment, what she would say?

100
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:15,270
-For the time being I recovered quite well except from the last 3 days

101
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:20,170
and today my meninges are just like fire.

102
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:24,270
-Because she over worked? Because of the examination?

103
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:31,620
-Because it is excitement too and exertion, it is exhausting the exam.

104
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,030
-Headaches of school girls is called this.

105
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:43,010
-Then the first anniversary of my mother death came, that was on the 5th of April

106
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,700
and I forgot the date but not my body.

107
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:56,520
I completely freaked out, I was feeling so full of hatred, I was shouting at people,

108
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:03,350
insulting them and then I really flit into my office, into my practices

109
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,850
and I was sitting there for some minutes and then I thought

110
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:12,620
this is exactly like Nat. muriaticum state I was in after the death of my mother.

111
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:19,950
And then, like a year ago I took Nat. mur. 10M.

112
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:24,440
The effect was that within one hour I was out of this state

113
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:30,290
but after this everything was very narrow in my brain, in my head

114
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:33,310
and I know this from former times, too.

115
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:40,560
What I haven't had so far was an understanding for people in grief and now I have it.

116
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:46,040
What brought the week following were icy cold feet,

117
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:52,310
it was one week after the 5th of April, icy cold feet they were like a big clumb.

118
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:58,710
One day I ate an egg salad made of 10 eggs, which usually I wouldn't do...

119
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,460
-10 eggs!

120
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:09,210
-Yes, obviously the Calcarea state would come up and during the night my neck was wet,

121
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,790
not in the back but in the front.

122
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:17,220
Some days later I had burning feet, they were so hot, I couldn't wear any shoes

123
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:24,060
and for about 25 years for the first time I had the feeling I'm really absolutely lazy.

124
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:35,400
-After Calc. carbonica?
-Not carbonica, I didn't take it.

125
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:46,050
-But the last remedy she had so far was Nat. muriaticum 10M

126
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:50,550
and then after the Nat. mur. was the cold feet and the desire for eggs

127
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:54,040
and then the sweating and then the hot feet.

128
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,040
Until now?

129
00:13:55,140 --> 00:14:01,320
-It was changing then but now here in the warmth outside, I'm having warm feet.

130
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:07,210
And what was changing too with the Nat. mur. is that about 3 years ago,

131
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:14,560
I had a kidney inflammation and nephritis and when I was getting the Nat. mur. 10X,

132
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:21,890
after the grief for my mother, immediately the kidney got warm and this time too.

133
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:32,550
With the state of Nat. mur. obviously my buttocks are very cold and the kidneys too

134
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:43,980
and then all the energy is gone and it flows out of my head and my tonsils are swollen.

135
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,380
Every time I'm greedy, I'm punishing myself for it afterwards.

136
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,650
This is really very strong.

137
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:58,140
Concerning my senses I'm a very lively personality and always when I get the feeling

138
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,880
that I'm crossing a border I sort of punish myself. What is there?

139
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:12,470
Since my first menstruation, the fissures between my toes are so deep

140
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:18,140
I have to peel off the skin that is above the fissures,

141
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,230
otherwise they will tear even further down.

142
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:36,820
Cones on my toes. I have 3 of them. On the little toe and in between.

143
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,060
As a child I had warts on my soles, once they had been burned of

144
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:50,050
and then they reappeared and when I was about 30, I was speaking to them

145
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,810
and then they disappeared.

146
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:02,960
Water is real problem for me, when I go into the water, I don't warm up afterwards.

147
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,080
That is really a problem for me.

148
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:20,390
I had a fear of dogs, that was so pronounced that my hands would grip with water

149
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,900
when I only would meet a dog.

150
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:29,050
I mentioned it last time. I got Arsenicum and then later on Causticum

151
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:34,430
and after Causticum it disappeared for about a 3-4 years. It was gone.

152
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:40,800
2 years ago I had a very severe influenza with fever, first time in my life

153
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:51,890
and then I took Causticum 1M and after this the fear of dog was gone

154
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:54,340
and in nowadays I can touch every dog.

155
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:04,650
Concerning my menstruation, before menstruation I'm irritable up to really picking fights.

156
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:11,550
When my menstruation starts I have to lie down for 2 hours. If I don't do this,

157
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:15,140
I don't come up to my energy level for about a week.

158
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:28,400
During this time I have very deep fissures in my anus, itching and really very swollen abdomen.

159
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,130
-Because of flatus?

160
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:41,730
-The whole tissue is like swollen, then I have a very swollen abdomen.

161
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:46,630
-As if she has a lot of fat in there? Flabbiness.

162
00:17:46,730 --> 00:18:00,900
-Then I feel nauseous and I have to belch like an automatic machine gun.

163
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:08,880
I once made a proving of Argentum nitricum up to the C200 and this symptom occurred

164
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:14,410
after this proving and for the time being is getting worse and worse.

165
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:22,400
I'm sleeping on my abdomen, one knee is caught against the body and one is stretched

166
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:27,150
and I'm turning a lot and this changed since I'm here on Alonissos.

167
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:34,550
And yesterday I had a massage because my third vertebrae had been dislocated

168
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:41,400
and she really must have done a good job because all changed into really severe lumbago afterwards.

169
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:48,910
And I hardly can lie on my back, it's really pretty bad.

170
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:55,890
This too started about 3-4 weeks ago, while I was doing some yoga exercises,

171
00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:04,490
where you have to breathe onto the pelvis and then breathe out onto the vertebrae spine.

172
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:11,140
I did it at maximum 3 times the day and that was enough that the whole plate

173
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:17,650
was getting inflamed and it was a feeling as if the flash would go off the bones.

174
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:23,600
-So painful?
-And the same would arise around here.

175
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:32,610
-How she feels with drafts?
-Not in my neck but in my back.

176
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:38,260
-What about cold? She is cold, hot, where she stands now?

177
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:43,190
-I got warmer but my tolerance between cold and heat is very small.

178
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:53,920
-How is her head? How is the mental condition? She has more clear head?

179
00:19:54,020 --> 00:20:00,920
-It got clearer now due to the fact that this part is open now but I'm still having headaches

180
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,020
on different locations.

181
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,550
-How is her thirst?

182
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:15,030
-I don't feel thirsty but when I drink, I will drink half a liter at the time.

183
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:32,280
-She had perspiration after excitement, now she mentions nausea after excitement.

184
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:36,350
-My hands are completely wet and to my axillae.

185
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:42,090
-What about eggs now?
-I eat at least 3 the day, for the time being.

186
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:46,450
-Sweets?
-Not so much, I do eat some.

187
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,350
-What about salt?

188
00:20:54,450 --> 00:21:01,530
-I like salty things but not as much as I used to. This went down after taking Nat. muriaticum.

189
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:10,010
-The irritability before menses is very great? It's more than before?

190
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:12,530
-No, it stays the same.

191
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:17,750
-The fissure stays the same, as before?

192
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:25,260
-They are always there, they are like before but the itching is nearly unbearable

193
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,860
during the time of menses.

194
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,090
It's itching all the time but during the menses it's nearly unbearable

195
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:39,960
and there are all different kinds of hemorrhoids but during the time of menses they are swollen.

196
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,600
-What about perspiration before menses?

197
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:55,090
-3 nights before menses, during the night I'm all wet around the breast area.

198
00:21:55,190 --> 00:22:00,280
It's so much perspiration that the bed would be wet.

199
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:06,870
-Still there is? More than before?
-No, it stayed the same.

200
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:16,890
-What about bacon, pork she likes this time? Smoked meat?

201
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:29,880
-Up to the time of the C200 of Calc. phoshorica was acting, I would unpack the sausages

202
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,310
and eat them right in the shop.

203
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,800
-Now not anymore?

204
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,820
-If it's a real good salami, I will still eat it; otherwise not.

205
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:53,150
-But she still has it now this desire?
-It's got much less.

206
00:22:54,890 --> 00:23:06,480
-The desire for eggs it was there underlined once, now is more the way she says it.

207
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,580
-I've never in my life eaten so many eggs.

208
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:16,240
-So it has increased.
-The desire eggs got much stronger.

209
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,890
-What about vertigo high places?

210
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:24,160
-When I was a child my father carried me down from a mountain tour

211
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,510
because I couldn't descend anymore.

212
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:43,410
-And her feet at this moment with this heat in bed, they are warm, cold, normal?

213
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:49,650
-In bed normal but I wouldn't be able to sleep without wearing trousers

214
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:53,420
because I can't sleep without my knees being covered.

215
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:01,420
-Because she feels cold in her knees especially?
-At night.

216
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,930
-OK, take a dose of Calcarea carbonica 200.
