1
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,510
-In last May I came to you and I said that I had some problems.

2
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,250
-No you said that you felt very bad, you had taken the remedy which I gave you.

3
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:58,230
-The last one was Ignatia 200 and I didn't sleep at all after Ignatia and then I came to you.

4
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:06,060
-And you said that you have been sleepless all these nights and that you feel very bad

5
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,910
and then you started telling me this story.

6
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:24,060
-Before I came here I had some problems with my parents who wanted me and pressured me

7
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,060
to divorce from my husband.

8
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:36,410
On the other side was my husband which I loved him and I was somewhere between them.

9
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:44,360
I had some suicidal thoughts.

10
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:54,890
-You must say also that you are very close to your parents, you were brought up in an

11
00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:02,890
environment very autocratic and very strict, your parents were supportive but at the same

12
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,330
time they were suppressive.

13
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:11,830
-Yes and they wanted to support them in the same way...

14
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,830
-That they supported you.

15
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:23,600
-Yes and they didn't want to accept that I'm married and I work.

16
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,260
-And they were pressurizing you in different ways to divorce.

17
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,600
-Yes.

18
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:38,500
-By saying what? Your husband is a medical doctor?

19
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:45,250
-Yes he is a medical doctor, he is practicing Homeopathy but another kind of Homeopathy,

20
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:48,600
not to give one remedy, to give many remedies.

21
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:59,500
At that time I couldn't understand why they pressure me so much to divorce but

22
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:12,250
after I came home I started to understand some things, so I didn't take Aurum that evening

23
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,300
I let to take it when I will arrive at home.

24
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:26,000
-After telling me the story I said to you, you must take Aurum 200. Very good.

25
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,000
Which you did not take.

26
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:37,250
-I let it to take it at home. When I arrived at home everything was OK, my husband was kind,

27
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:47,750
gentle and then he said he has some work to do and let me to rest and then I have

28
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:58,000
a shock because I saw that all these things from the house are gone, the clothes,

29
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:06,100
the books, everything and I said OK I must take Aurum now and I took it.

30
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:25,510
Then I wait for him and he said, OK I move because I want from you some things that

31
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,850
I cannot obtain if I stay with you.

32
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:43,750
So he said till you will give me some money about 3000$ something like that,

33
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:53,750
he said I own to him these money, he will not go to sleep with me anymore and he will not

34
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,350
live with me anymore. And I had a second shock.

35
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:04,250
I said it's not possible, you are joking. He said, no I'm very serious and he was serious.

36
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:10,100
He left the house with everything and we have no relation till now.

37
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,750
-You live separately.

38
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:27,250
-Yes and little by little I started to discover all kind of fixed ideas, fears that he has and

39
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:36,330
he started to make around me, he talks with somebody he says something wrong about me

40
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:41,910
and then he comes and prepares me that that man will come and tell you...

41
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:54,010
I wasn't sure if I'm right or he is right, I wasn't sure about my judgment, I was so...

42
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:06,550
I don't know for a period of time I wasn't sure for my judgment.

43
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:11,350
I said I'm insane and he is healthy.

44
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:27,600
And one evening we had a quarrel and I decided to finish with the life because there is no use.

45
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:35,660
So I want to kill myself, I couldn't support me anymore.

46
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:41,240
It was too much for me but I couldn't find any medicine in the house, he has all the remedies,

47
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:50,740
so in the next morning very upset I said to him, you know last night I wanted to kill myself

48
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,090
and his answer was yes, why you didn't do it.

49
00:06:55,590 --> 00:07:07,220
And I took another dose of Aurum in the 1st of July and then I tried to speak with my parents

50
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:17,480
and to understand what is happening because I must know and I found out that they saw his real

51
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:26,570
face before me and they tried to tell me but I loved him too much to see the reality.

52
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:41,480
Another thing happened, when I was here, the office was opened and he took all my patients.

53
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:52,970
I don't know what he told them, he spoiled all my treatments because he gets a lot of remedies

54
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:58,980
and then he said, OK you can go and practice.

55
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:07,630
I can have 1,2,3 new patients but at the end of the week or he was at the office and that patient

56
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:13,820
had an aggravation, he called him and treat him and I lose that patient again.

57
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,970
And he says it's not true, they just come at me because they love me.

58
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:29,970
So I was in a situation that I couldn't earn money and he wouldn't give any money at the house,

59
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:34,320
not at all and the financial problems are mine.

60
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:41,800
-You practice in the same house where you live?

61
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:50,380
-No in a different house. So I'm moving in another town and I'm going to open there an office

62
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,140
because there I have now a lot of patients.

63
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:02,230
So I just closed in my town my office because it's no use.

64
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:11,480
-But your office was the same with his office?
-Yes we work in the same building.

65
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:20,630
-And now you closed it. That means he stayed in that apartment?

66
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:28,630
-No we do not live there, neither me or him.

67
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,380
-He opened another office?

68
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,880
-No, he stayed in my office but now I closed and he remained with anything because

69
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:43,980
I closed and I said, I will not let you do any treatment anymore, I close it.

70
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:49,050
-This is your personal apartment?

71
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:59,050
-Yes, it's my private apartment and it's my private office. He treats because I'm his wife.

72
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,350
I let him.

73
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:19,760
So in the middle of July an old friend of mine met me and saw that I was very changed

74
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:27,860
and he said what happened to you, you are like a dead person, what happened?

75
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:36,760
-Then I couldn't stop, I start crying and saying all things and from that moment

76
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:48,510
he started doing like psychotherapy with me and to show me that my judgment was right

77
00:10:48,610 --> 00:11:00,370
and he is an ill person and day by day I just started to see what is good and what is wrong.

78
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:16,860
In August I had another problem, my mother had to be operated by uterus carcinoma,

79
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:25,760
I didn't want to have operation, I wanted to treat her but this was her decision

80
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:35,010
so I stayed with her 2 days and 2 nights, I had a lot of fears, if she will be OK,

81
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:46,040
if she will live and then it appeared another idea which still goes on,

82
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:57,680
3 of my grand parents died from cancer, my grand mother had uterus cancer and my mother

83
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:12,690
had cancer of the breast 8 years ago and I started thinking if I can have something like that because

84
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:21,030
I stop the sexual life and this will be quite a problem.

85
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:33,430
After Aurum my menses stopped and I was quite worried about it and I told to my husband,

86
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:42,180
I said, look my mother is with that, we stopped having sex for a long time, I have no period.

87
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:53,780
So this is your problem not my problem, he said. I think he has somebody else, I'm not sure.

88
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,680
-You still live together?

89
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:06,030
-No, he lives separately, he comes at home only to eat once the day.

90
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,930
-In your house with your parents?

91
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:21,180
-No my parents stay apart, in another house. He comes to eat, I can be at home or not

92
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:34,180
but it's not very important to be at home when he comes. I was very terrified because

93
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:42,530
2-3 times he said he will kill me and 2-3 times he said he will beat me.

94
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,930
-He said he will beat you or he beat you?

95
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:55,180
-No, once he was near but somebody came and he stopped. At that moment I take the

96
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:00,280
decision to divorce because I can not live in such a manner.

97
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,210
-When did you take the decision?

98
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:23,180
-In the beginning of September when I had a terrible quarrel and in the middle of this quarrel

99
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:35,680
I felt that my menses started and I had another problem after the menses, in the period

100
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:41,060
of ovulation I had great pains in the night.

101
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,060
-Where?

102
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:52,990
-Ovary, uterus, something like that, I was very excited, I couldn't sleep, I was turning

103
00:14:53,090 --> 00:15:04,990
around and finally I go and take a cold shower to recover, that was 2 nights, one after another

104
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:16,480
and I told him we need to have a life together and he said, we can find somebody else,

105
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:22,690
he will not disturb me but he will not divorce from me. I want you to be with me

106
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,040
and you will die near me.

107
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:32,650
I don't know if it will be like that because we already made the file for the divorce

108
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:46,180
and when I come back I don't know how he will react but in the last month I changed myself.

109
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:56,490
I became stronger and I can answer him without being afraid that he will beat me or kill me,

110
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,580
I said, if you want, do it.

111
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:11,170
And he considered that the fact that we are not living together is not enough to start a divorce.

112
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,570
-He said?

113
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:23,700
-Yes. He doesn't want children now, maybe next year, maybe we'll see, we wait.

114
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:30,820
Now in the last moment he will do everything...

115
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,350
-Are you sure you were not pregnant?

116
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:44,420
-No. I haven't slept with him until the end of April, so it's 5 months.

117
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:54,070
He became jealous he didn't want to let me come here, he said that I have here a boyfriend

118
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:58,670
and that I came from here pregnant and now that I have no menses...

119
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:09,670
-He said you are pregnant with another man?
-Yes. So that's it.

120
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:17,500
-But after all you look good. I don't know how.

121
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:31,500
-That friend of mine helped me very much with talking.

122
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,150
-Is he a medical doctor?

123
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:47,400
-No, just a friend and we talk daily and when I am little depressed and in something I'm not sure,

124
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:54,390
I call him, I meet him, we fix the problem and everything is OK.

125
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,740
I have a spot and it's much easier.

126
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:13,740
I have also migraines before the menses, strong headaches 2-3 days.

127
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:19,000
-2-3 days before menses you have a headache?
-Yes.

128
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,360
-Where is the headache?

129
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:36,070
-In the beginning I feel that the head will explode and then it's like in a circle

130
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:48,420
which is very tight in occipital and in front and when the menses start, the migraine disappears.

131
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:53,370
If I have normal life, I will not have migraine.

132
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:07,610
-Psychologically how you feel now? If you measure the last month, the last 15 days

133
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:14,250
can you describe your psychological state and say my main problem is this.

134
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:23,460
-I feel good in general. I have little fear that it is possible to remain alone.

135
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:34,360
I don't like to be alone, I need to have somebody near me, I need to have friends

136
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:48,460
and all this period I haven't. He took care and he threw away all my friends.

137
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:53,460
-In order to be with him?

138
00:19:53,960 --> 00:20:03,380
-Yes and to listen only to what he said, not another opinion. I don't like to be alone,

139
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:13,830
I think this is the most important fear that I have. It's not very strong but it comes.

140
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:28,700
At the same time I think what kind of life I will have, if I remain with him, so I think

141
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,800
I took the right decision.

142
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:44,700
I will open an office in another town and go there and start practice have other patients and

143
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,300
after a while I will open again in my town.

144
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:58,110
-I think the only problem is when such cases, as you say, if he is not balanced this man

145
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:02,460
maybe he will trouble you for certain period of time.

146
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:18,610
-I think so but it's another thing that is unusual for me. I told him if he will bother me or

147
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:29,130
he will do something not to divorce and give me troubles, I will revenge.

148
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:46,480
I'm not revengeful but I feel that I can revenge on him and I told him that I can destroy him

149
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:57,730
that he will not be able ever to get up again. I can and he knows. He asked me once,

150
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:02,950
you can revenge for me and I said yes I can. You are joking?

151
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:12,980
No, I'm not joking and I really believe that Ican do it. I never do it but now it's new,

152
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:25,060
this revenge appear. And I will use the blackmail to let me in peace, I have no other choice.

153
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:36,310
I told him to take a remedy and to be well and he doesn't want because he is a healthy person!

154
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:51,890
-If he threatens that he will kill you or beat you and you have some proof of that, then you

155
00:22:51,990 --> 00:23:02,230
can always go to the police and report him. It's not something light.

156
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,980
-Yes I know.

157
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:13,730
-It's good that you stand up and you show strength.

158
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:24,880
-When I'm near him, sometimes I feel I'm paralyzed, I cannot do anything, I cannot

159
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:35,980
react and I must recover myself and put together and then to react. This is a great effort.

160
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:46,230
After that I'm finished and he is amazed, why am I reacting like that?

161
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:53,980
Because I must be like a Staphysagria, to be quiet, to say what he likes to hear

162
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,080
and everything will be OK not to hear what I want to say.

163
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:36,830
Like physical problem I have only 2. Since yesterday morning I have great pain on my spine,

164
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:40,330
it's like it is inflamed.

165
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:48,920
I can not have a position without pain, I don't know why, it's because of the trouble I don't know.

166
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:59,920
It's terrible. In the night I wake up and turn to one side or another to find a position, I can not.

167
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:06,160
-In the whole of the spine or the dorsal region?
-It's the whole spine.

168
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:10,350
-Do you feel pain like burning, stitching?

169
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:28,750
-No, it's like it is inflamed, like you have a joint twisted, something like that.

170
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:48,750
And I have a bad taste in the mouth, like metal and at the same time I think I have a bad smell.

171
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,000
-You mean offensive breath?
-Yes.

172
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,980
-Do you have problems with your teeth?

173
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:12,330
-I made a stomatological treatment just before I come here and I wasn't sure that Aurum will act.

174
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:19,580
I wanted to repeat but then I said, no it's better to come here than to repeat Aurum.

175
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:24,330
I think Aurum helped me very much.

176
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:31,230
-Do you have the written report which you sent me?

177
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:40,420
-No, I just called you in the telephone, I didn't send any fax.

178
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,560
-Do you have any salivation during night?

179
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:11,560
-No, the pain is so strong that I have the feeling that I will faint any moment.

180
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:19,660
I must lie down on something hard.

181
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:34,420
-There is any change in your desires, aversions, desire for salt more, for sweets?

182
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:46,060
-No. I think everything is normal, thirst 1-2 lit the day. Now I'm in a diet because

183
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,700
I want to lose weight.

184
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:56,070
-Do you need more heat or you can not tolerate the heat?

185
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:58,170
-No, normal.

186
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:08,320
-When you lie in bed the pain does not start immediately, it starts after some time?

187
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,170
-Yes or it starts when I sit.

188
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:17,060
-How long you have to lie before it starts 1 or 5 hours?

189
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:21,420
-No about half an hour, 1 hour something like that.

190
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,350
-And then it starts and then you have to change position all the time?

191
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:34,820
-Yes, one side or another with the knees on the chest, it's the best position not to have

192
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:46,200
pain but I like to sleep on the abdomen, it's the best position for the sleep but now I can not.

193
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:57,450
On the back it's impossible, I can not stay on the back in bed.

194
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,950
-Do you sigh?

195
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:21,540
-I sigh all summer but now it stops and I was crying all summer. I think I cried for all my life.

196
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,940
-After Aurum you were able to sleep immediately I think.

197
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,040
-Yes I sleep immediately.

198
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:36,200
-You felt quite good and you reported that you were handling the situation.

199
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:42,270
-Yes because at that time I wasn't sure what ...

200
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:45,620
-What was happening?
-Yes.

201
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:57,270
-So until the time you found out what was happening, your report was that you were fine

202
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:59,210
you were controlled.

203
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:09,850
-Yes because I thought that he was right, I was wrong, so I believed him and everything

204
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:19,950
was OK till I met that friend of mine who said, no it's not OK. Wake up. It's not OK.

205
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:31,700
You can not live like a slave, you must have your dignity, you must have your practice.

206
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:05,680
-Do you have a time where you feel better or worse? Your best and your worse time?

207
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:20,430
-Yes, my best time is in the afternoon and evening. The worse in the morning.

208
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:30,680
Now I must make and effort to get out of bed and to wake up and everything.

209
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:38,430
-How is your sexual desire?
-It's quite high.

210
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:04,390
-Do you have a lot of amalgam fillings in your teeth?

211
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:19,140
-Not amalgam, I think I have one tooth with another metal, I think silver and gold.

212
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:51,450
-Do you feel that you need special company or just anybody or you need companion?

213
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:53,950
You need a close friend?

214
00:32:54,050 --> 00:33:07,450
-I need a close friend, I need somebody to be near me all the time but now I haven't

215
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:20,300
because the time was too short. I want to have people around me and a lot of friends.

216
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:32,450
-So now actually you want to be social, you like people around, you are not closed to yourself?

217
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:43,640
-No, I want to be somebody. I can open my feelings to somebody, not to keep in me.

218
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:55,800
But mostly I need somebody to be all the time with me.

219
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:21,970
-The back pain is better when she lies on something hard but do you have to put your

220
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:25,700
feast on a certain point and lie on your feast?

221
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:53,010
-No just lie and with the knees up or to put both hands in the lumbago region.

222
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:56,860
If I put the hands in the lumbago region, then I can stay down.

223
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,090
-Motion ameliorates?

224
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:10,590
-No, she has to move all the time but you are relieved for a few seconds if you move?

225
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:21,340
-If I move it's OK but if I sit or lie down or I stay long time in the same place,

226
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,190
in the first 5 minutes, the pain starts.

227
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:38,600
-And if you move it's OK. In the beginning of motion it's more and then ameliorates?

228
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,440
-No, it's less, less and then disappears.

229
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:46,690
-Then motion ameliorates put 3 times.

230
00:35:55,690 --> 00:36:07,840
Do you have any bloatedness, some gas?
-Yes, if I'm fasting I have a lot of gas.

231
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:10,330
-Fasting you mean?

232
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:14,080
Not to eat at all.

233
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,410
-And can you fast or you feel difficult?

234
00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:36,660
-I can fast 2-3 o'clock in the afternoon till morning and then I must eat something.

235
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,160
I can not keep all the day.

236
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:42,160
-You can not keep all the day or day after day?
-No.

237
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:33,960
-In general, at this moment, the cold or the heat suits you best or you don't care?

238
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:40,740
-No, it's the same.

239
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:47,200
-If there is a draft you don't mind?
-No.

240
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:59,960
-Do you have the tendency to cry?
-Not now, in the last month no.

241
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,580
-The menses have come back?
-In September.

242
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,990
-Normal or the blood was more?
-No, it was normal.

243
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:07,360
-Your sexual desire has anything to do with before or after menses?

244
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,460
-No.

245
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:33,440
-Do you eat onions at all?
-I like onions. No problem.

246
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:40,840
-The amount of sweets that you take, would you say normal?

247
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:45,780
-Normal, I have no special desire for sweets.

248
00:39:54,220 --> 00:40:01,690
-Bloatedness?
-From time to time and if I fast I have it.

249
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:54,950
You remember the case from last seminar where she had several days that she could

250
00:40:55,050 --> 00:41:04,450
not sleep and she was going down and down and we prescribed Ignatia and the last day

251
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:14,950
of the seminar she came inside and she said, I don't feel better at all, I'm still not sleeping

252
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:21,900
and she broke out crying and telling me the story about the conflict between her parents

253
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:28,700
and the husband and her parents forcing her to divorce and she did not want to divorce

254
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:40,950
and she was in between that situation and she was in a terrible depression with suicidal disposition.

255
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:47,700
This story did not come out during the interview, it came out in the office and

256
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:54,950
I said to her take Aurum 200. She took Aurum 200 and because I worried about her,

257
00:41:55,050 --> 00:42:00,950
I asked my secretary to telephone her after a few days to see what was happening

258
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:05,360
because I knew the depression was quite serious.

259
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:16,030
And Lona telephoned and you can say what was the conversation. Can you remember exactly?

260
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:22,280
-Yes, I asked her how she was feeling and after she took the Aurum she said, she felt

261
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:25,880
very much better. That was about all.

262
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:46,950
-Well, anyhow I got the message that she was well and I said OK. Then eventually she

263
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:54,700
discovered what was happening and then most probably she needed another dose of

264
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:01,210
Aurum which she took. I did not advice for that, she took it herself.

265
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:10,630
What is impressive for me is when I look at her, how well she looks.

266
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:21,530
After all this I would expect to see somebody totally destroyed etc. and I think she is back

267
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:31,030
to life and therefore we are going now to search for the next remedy to see

268
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:33,890
if we can help her further.

269
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:44,950
We took the case and we took these symptoms, you can show these symptoms and tell

270
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:51,630
me if you would like to take another symptom or you want to change one.

271
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:57,960
Family history of cancer, menses...

272
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:05,500
-It doesn't count, zero.
-What do you mean zero?

273
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:10,320
-It's on the list but not in the evaluation.

274
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:24,570
-Ailments from mortification, sighing, even sighing you can take it out, now there is no sighing.

275
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:27,350
-No.

276
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:59,300
-Not sighing really but you can leave it.
-She has menses now.

277
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:04,400
-That's why we don't take into consideration the symptom, it's zero.

278
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,560
-Sorry.

279
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:31,930
-The head pain which she described, which is exploding, a head pain before menses is

280
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:34,440
a Belladonna headache.

281
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:48,340
The Belladonna woman before menses have headaches, instead of being depressed or irritable,

282
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:51,940
they develop headaches.

283
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:13,340
Bursting before menses, constriction before menses, beginning of menses ameliorates

284
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:23,190
revengeful, taste metallic, odor offensive, pain on back on something hard ameliorates...

285
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:32,590
This pain also is a pain different that what she describes. This pain which is described in

286
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:45,850
the Repertory is a pain which you have to put at the point of pain, pressure and then you

287
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:56,170
lie on it and then slowly there is amelioration. What she described lying on something hard

288
00:46:56,270 --> 00:47:08,920
is a position of the spine which makes her feel better. It's not the hardness, it seems

289
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:18,670
that the position of the spine had to be flat to be best, so this symptom actually is not correct,

290
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:20,380
you can take it out.

291
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:39,850
Drawing up limbs ameliorates, desire for company.

292
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:49,550
-That symptom wasn't in back, I only found something in extremities, so if anybody finds back,

293
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:53,630
drawing up limbs ameliorates... I couldn't find it.

294
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:03,440
-Has anybody found this symptom?
-So I took extremities instead of back.

295
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:17,560
-Bending forward?
-No, it's in bed drawing up the legs.

296
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:20,880
-Yes, the back has to be flat.

297
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:34,050
-What is the analysis of these symptoms?

298
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:41,130
The analysis says Lycopodium, Lachesis, Nat. mur., Pulsatilla...

299
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:04,470
Motion ameliorates is very strong. Show me the symptom, motion ameliorates in pain in the back,

300
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:12,970
it's a very clear symptom. Motion not pressure.

301
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,490
-She said pressure.

302
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:31,800
-Not pressure. Dulcamara, Rhus tox and Lycopodium, Ammonium muriat.

303
00:49:47,050 --> 00:50:00,190
You see the Rhus tox first has to have more pain in the movement. So therefore it's not

304
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:09,190
a case of Rhus tox and for different reasons, she doesn't feel the cold, she doesn't need

305
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:13,040
the heat to support her pains.

306
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:35,330
With the metallic taste and the offensive breath you think of Mercury, not confirmed.

307
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:44,180
You need the third symptom, salivation during night, you say this is a Mercury case and

308
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:54,330
therefore Lycopodium is the best possibility. The question is shall we give it, yes or no?

309
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,330
-No.

310
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:05,900
-Shall we give it, yes or no?
-No.

311
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:16,750
-Who says no?
-Who says yes? 2 courageous men.

312
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:28,580
-I think that the entire process is now going down to the physical plane because she has more strength

313
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:34,000
and she made a decision for herself, so I would really say, let's wait.

314
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:49,150
-That's exactly the situation, I'm afraid that when sometimes grief affects the whole of the back

315
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:58,130
and especially with Ignatia we have a cramp that goes from the cervical right to the sacral region

316
00:51:58,230 --> 00:52:10,370
and the whole area is cramped and this can stay for years after grief which is the somatisation of

317
00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:15,920
a psychological problem.

318
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:21,930
Now in her case she says, as if there is inflammation, this is better than the cramps

319
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:29,480
because the inflammation can be controlled easier, in case it stays.

320
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:40,390
I agree with the decision, we have to wait at this moment because of the good condition

321
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:49,390
of the mental emotional in spite of so much upheaval, which she could not control before.

322
00:52:49,490 --> 00:53:00,290
You remember she was in a state of great stress before with this conflict and she lost totally

323
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:07,540
her sleep, that means leading her to a depression that was quite deep, since Aurum has acted,

324
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:09,890
the depression was really serious.

325
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:22,040
Therefore looking how well she is psychological, we have to wait in spite of the fact

326
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:29,140
the repertorization will show a remedy, most probably indicated and we just have it in mind.
