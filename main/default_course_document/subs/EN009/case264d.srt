1
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:37,960
-OK, that is the third follow up and you have taken originally Sepia

2
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:49,070
and then you took Arsenicum and the last follow up you took nothing.

3
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:58,210
So can you tell me what was happening?

4
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:16,290
-After September when I came back home I start to have some troubles at my work and

5
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:31,290
those troubles become more and more and in April, when I find out that there is

6
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:41,040
the possibility that I can't come here because of the job, I had two days of depression

7
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,810
and it was quite bad.

8
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:52,810
Not so intense as in the past but it appeared quite bad.

9
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,560
-Why they did not allow you to come?

10
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:11,180
-After I came back the boss changed and another one came and he didn't agree to practice

11
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:21,100
something else but to practice only allopathic medicine, not homeopathic not acupuncture,

12
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,950
not any kind of alternative.

13
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:37,440
And I stopped but he was not satisfied but he continued making me all kind of problems and

14
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:49,040
now I understood that he will not let me to work there anymore, I don't know.

15
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:56,030
When I come back at home it is possible that I find out that I can not work anymore.

16
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:06,440
In April that was very bad news for me and I suffered.

17
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:12,290
Now it's OK, he can do whatever he likes.

18
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,540
-That's better.

19
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:29,030
-In that two days of depression I cried a lot and that's not usual for me. This is not usual.

20
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:46,690
And also in December when I was very pressed with all kind of problems, I had a pain here.

21
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:55,290
In one point it was like a knife and I had this pain until 1-2 weeks ago,

22
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:02,010
when it became a little diffused but it was very acute.

23
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:09,610
I couldn't move, if I was going to make any move, it was like a knife.

24
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:16,110
-Internal.
-Yes, in one point it was like a knife.

25
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:32,260
-In December I had my wedding.

26
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:41,760
-Ah you got married. This is the first thing you should tell, my god. Congratulations.

27
00:04:41,860 --> 00:05:01,510
-Thank you. After I start my sexual life it appeared some pains and I go to the gynecologist

28
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,110
and he said that I have condylomata.

29
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:13,860
Now it's OK but one month it was very painful.

30
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:28,010
In January I made a cystitis for 1 month, it was very bad.

31
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:36,510
For the first week I said OK, I let it pass without doing anything but then I tried

32
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:44,360
to take some remedies in low potency but without any effect.

33
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:56,760
So after 1 month I couldn't spot anymore and I took 4 pills of antibiotics.

34
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:05,010
One of them was the slightest antibiotic I could find.

35
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:09,370
-But why didn't you phone? Did you take Cantharis?

36
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:15,880
-Yes, it was good for 2 days.

37
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,880
-Good for 2 days but it started again. But you needed higher potency.

38
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,310
-I was afraid to take higher potency.

39
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:33,320
-If you had told me, I would immediately tell you the remedy but anyhow.

40
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:46,470
-In this winter I had 4 times a flu and this is new.
-Very good.

41
00:06:50,560 --> 00:07:03,640
-But one of them I had high fever, 40 degrees, and this happened to me for the first time.

42
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,980
It never happened.

43
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:14,380
-But I'm sure when you were a baby you had also but you don't remember.

44
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:22,380
-And I was scared because such temperature I never had and I told to my husband

45
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:35,980
you know I never had such a big fever and he said, all right let's try to make it less.

46
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,290
-And you took aspirin?

47
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:52,380
-No, he tried to make something like a massage with vinegar and after 1 min. or less

48
00:07:52,480 --> 00:08:04,370
I had such a feeling of suffocation, I couldn't breathe anymore and I let the head

49
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,480
to have enough air.

50
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:16,630
I go to the window and I start coughing, so strongly and then I was breathing and

51
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:23,480
between coughing I had apnea and I had a feeling that in the next minute I will die.

52
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:33,890
So all this kept for 10 min. It was awful. I couldn't stand it.

53
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:40,380
Finally I went into the shower and I took all the vinegar from the body and I stopped coughing

54
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,730
and I started breathing.

55
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:48,880
After 2-3 days I tried to open a bottle with vinegar to see what's happened and

56
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:54,340
I started coughing immediately, so vinegar for me is finished.

57
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,280
-Very interesting.

58
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:06,860
-I had this allergy I think, with strong odors, it was awful.

59
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,760
-But you never before experienced this with vinegar.

60
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,690
-No.

61
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:34,840
Then 2 weeks before I come here, I cut one of my legs by accident and I go to the surgeon

62
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:43,690
to put stitches and he makes me local anesthesia with Xyline.

63
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:56,590
It was about 10 min. and when I get up I feel dizziness.

64
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:08,840
I had the good idea to say, let's go to another room and lie down for a while

65
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:22,340
but when I arrived there I start breathing very shortly and very frequent and immediately

66
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:33,110
cramps appeared in all the muscles and I just jumped from bed so strong with cramps.

67
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:43,340
My lips and my tongue was numbed and I don't understand why because it was a local anesthesia

68
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,190
and I think...

69
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,090
-It was xylocaine?

70
00:10:48,190 --> 00:11:03,430
-Xyline which stomatologist use and I had anesthesia with xyline before

71
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,940
but it never happened like this time.

72
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:16,010
I ask myself what will happen if I need real operation.

73
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,610
-No problem, I'll tell you.

74
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:35,760
-Then I have spontaneous ecchymosis, they appeared suddenly without any touch and

75
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,610
they are quite big and persistent for a long time.

76
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:49,860
-Did you have a blood examination?
-No. I don't like to make tests.

77
00:11:54,620 --> 00:12:00,860
I observed that it appeared a crack on my tongue.

78
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:08,510
-At one point?
-No, it's all cracked.

79
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:14,190
-Can I see it? Very small.

80
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,670
-It appeared pain in the...
-...Joints.

81
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:41,020
-Yes, only at the hands and it reappeared fear of elevator.

82
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:52,190
It's not very strong but when I come to elevator, I have a fear and it doesn't disappear,

83
00:12:54,520 --> 00:13:01,520
it is not quite strong, it is to be alone in the night at home.

84
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:07,440
I still have that fear that somebody can come in.

85
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,590
-Robber?

86
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:24,570
-Not to steel but that they can do something, they can kill me or something like that.

87
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:38,920
-Yes, to do some harm.
-I still have edema under the eyes in the morning.

88
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,330
-Did you drink coffee also?

89
00:13:55,330 --> 00:14:03,180
-I drink only 3 times because I was very tired and another thing is that I can not recover

90
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:12,580
myself very easy when I'm tired and this is unusual. I need too much time to recover.

91
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:23,330
Usually in 1-2 days I was recovering and now I need 10 days and this is too much.

92
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:42,830
I'm all the time tired and it reappeared the cramp in the legs at night.

93
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,990
-Especially with a stretching like you said last time?

94
00:14:56,090 --> 00:15:00,830
-Yes and now I wake up with the cramp.

95
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:11,320
-How is the leucorrhea you said last time?
-I have it and it's quite a lot.

96
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:15,920
-It's the same, this sweet odor?
-Yes.

97
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:21,570
-The desire for coffee is still there?
-No, only if I'm very tired.

98
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:26,320
-You need something.
-Yes, because I have a lot of work.

99
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,820
-Sensitivity to noise that you have mentioned last time?

100
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:39,080
-Yes, to the clock. I took the clock from bedroom, I put it in another room and then I can sleep.

101
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:45,480
-Also you had numbness of the toes when you walk.

102
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,690
-No.

103
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:50,010
-You mention now only during the cramps.

104
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,430
How are your menses now? Clotted?

105
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:04,750
-The same but a little shorter. It's not 10 days, it's only 7 days.

106
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:13,500
-How is your sexual desire? It's OK?
-It's OK now.

107
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,180
-And the coldness at the foot at night is still there?
-Yes.

108
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:24,480
-Do you also perspire in the feet easily?

109
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:33,830
-When I had emotions even if it's hot outside, me feet are cold and with cold perspiration.

110
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:42,480
-In the night when you sleep, do you get perspiration in the upper part of your body?

111
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,580
-No.

112
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:51,970
-The desire for sweets, how is that?
-I haven't.

113
00:16:55,020 --> 00:17:06,220
-Your weight?
-It's much more. I put very easily weight.

114
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,220
-You have to watch what you eat?

115
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:25,650
-Yes but I can not keep a diet because I'm hungry. I can not do diet but I don't eat too much.

116
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,050
-How is your sleep? You sleep right through?

117
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:42,900
-I sleep very good but in the morning I wake up a little unrefreshed.

118
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:55,150
I wake up difficult, I need more sleep and it's very difficult.

119
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:02,050
-Did you check yourself from a high place looking down, if you have problem now?

120
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:10,470
-I have a little fear but if I do, I have a little dizziness.

121
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:21,720
I can go near but I have little fear which I can control, I can go near

122
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,770
and look without any problem.

123
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:30,730
-The stitching pain here has gone totally now or it is there?

124
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:33,300
-It is there.

125
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,980
-How much per cent is there?
-30%.

126
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:45,570
-The pains in the joints since where they disappeared?

127
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:50,720
-Since November, December something like that.

128
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:23,790
-How is your reaction to weather?
-No problem.

129
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:28,790
-That means you feel the heat very much, you feel the cold more?

130
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:31,390
-No, it's normal.

131
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:46,790
-Also you have mentioned last time, you were forgetting what you wanted to say.

132
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,890
-It's OK now.

133
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:13,040
-The need for salt how much is it?

134
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:29,220
-Normal. I need more lemon, sour, a little bit not too much.

135
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:20,090
In this case we see again this idea coming from the second group, from 3rd to the 2d.

136
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:28,090
This was quite a deep depression originally and immediately coming to this group,

137
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:31,840
she starts having the flu.

138
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:41,590
It took her 1 year before she started having the acutes and then she gets the cystitis and then

139
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:44,770
even more she gets a very high fever.

140
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:55,000
She said, she never had before which happens with certain remedies, they don't get a high fever.

141
00:21:55,100 --> 00:22:01,500
For instance if you are in the state of Arsenicum, in a depression of Arsenicum,

142
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,700
you will almost never experience fever.

143
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:17,840
So people who will say I never develop fever, many times they need Arsenicum, we have said this

144
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,440
in the Materia Medica I think.

145
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,940
Why the cystitis?

146
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:47,430
We have spoken about Cantharis I think.

147
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:55,250
We said that when a woman gets married for the first time and especially if it's a person

148
00:22:55,350 --> 00:23:05,000
who really controls herself, not a person who goes every night or every second night with another man,

149
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:12,670
especially those women who control themselves and then they go into a marriage where they

150
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:31,770
feel free to have sex then the excitement gives an easy inflammation of the vagina.

151
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:48,670
There is a lot of blood concentrating in this area and they can develop severe cystitis,

152
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:52,440
which is usually of the type of Cantharis.

153
00:23:54,360 --> 00:24:02,430
Because the pain is there, yet the desire to continue is there and that irritates more and more

154
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:12,760
and then they go into really bloody cystitis, where the burning is so much and the irritation of the

155
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:28,430
mucus membranes, of the vagina so big that it will almost have blood, vaginitis or cystitis.

156
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:40,940
That's why I mentioned when she told me the Cantharis that she took most probably Cantharis 6, Cantharis 5.

157
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:52,580
This was not enough to control. She needed 200 every day 2-3 times the day before you can control that.

158
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:12,690
Now the question that we have is... She took antibitiotics, the coffee, the local anesthesia.

159
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:18,850
Does she have a relapse?

160
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:32,520
She took Sepia originally and then Arsenicum. Then we have that type of situation.

161
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:50,020
Now she is on another level, here, let us say Calc. carb.

162
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:58,420
She comes now with this level then underneath maybe Sulphur I don't know but she comes

163
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:06,590
with this level and there is a stimulation of this level, now the possibility is that either

164
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:11,850
the organism resists the relapse or the relapse will go back to Arsenicum.

165
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,340
You see what we have said?

166
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:29,910
So the judgment is, is she going back to Arsenicum or still is on that level?

167
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:38,410
The organism is still resisting to stay in this uppermost level now.

168
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:59,080
If now there is no relapse and we don't see the Arsenicum picture strongly and if this picture

169
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:03,330
is not clear, what we have to do?

170
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:05,830
-Wait.

171
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:13,870
-Wait OK. Do you remember in the last follow up in September we prescribed nothing.

172
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:20,790
Now I would like to show you the repertorization of the last time.

173
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
The last time we argued, if you remember,

174
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:30,010
whether we should give a remedy, yes or no and we decided not to give a remedy.

175
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:36,000
So it is about a year since she has not taken a remedy, correct?

176
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,650
-One year.

177
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:49,750
-Now she comes after a year and we still talk about waiting. You see how Homeopathy works?

178
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,910
That's the way Homeopathy works.

179
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:03,110
Is this the last time? Show me the symptoms.

180
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:20,780
Calc. carb. was the most prominent possibility for her and we decided not to give it.

181
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,550
Was it the right decision, yes or no?

182
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:27,680
-Yes.
-No.

183
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:35,440
Because if she still is on Calc. carb. that means we lost some time.

184
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:42,430
We should have speeded up, we were able to prescribe it and she would be much better

185
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:50,030
already and not with this kind of sensitivities, which she mentioned.

186
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:56,780
This is the previous one.

187
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:11,360
She was still having some sighing, ecchymosis, desire for cold drinks, forgetful, sensitive to noise, toes...

188
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:30,360
What was missing last time that she mentioned it this time?

189
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:34,360
-She puts on weight.

190
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:44,510
-She says, I'm putting on weight. That is another point for Calc. carb. What is missing?

191
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:54,260
The desire for sweets. What about eggs? Normal. You don't eat eggs?

192
00:30:54,360 --> 00:31:10,940
-I can eat eggs. It's normal but usually I prefer eggs soft boiled but I have no problem.

193
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:30,570
-Another point for Calcarea are the cramps in the legs at night.

194
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:40,160
-She had it from the previous time already. This is very interesting.

195
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:55,520
I have noticed that Calc. carb. is very sensitive to certain chemicals. Aspirin also.

196
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:14,910
If they take aspirin, they have a big allergic reaction but the reaction is interesting that comes

197
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:19,510
to the pathology of the Calc. carb.

198
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:21,510
Which pathology? Cramping.

199
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:30,190
When we say, I don't want to go into the cystitis because we didn't go into details of cystitis.

200
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:36,240
So if you take the case you will ask the details. When the pain is?

201
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:44,740
During, before after urination, no urination etc. How strong is very important.

202
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:53,410
If the cystitis in that case is very strong, it's burning, she is shouting every time she goes to urinate,

203
00:32:55,790 --> 00:33:00,190
this type of cystitis, then it's Cantharis.

204
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:16,560
But I did not go into the details of cystitis. I just asked her, did you take Cantharis?

205
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:23,920
She says, yes but the amelioration was only for 2 days, then most probably if she would have said

206
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:33,370
that on the telephone, I would say take a higher potency to save the antibiotics.

207
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:38,590
-George look at her sensitivity in Calcarea in her reaction on vinegar, it was very strong.

208
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:42,840
Perhaps it's the same direction and I think we have given last time the problem with the loss memory,

209
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:46,690
it's very quite better with that argument for Calcarea.

210
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:54,350
-The vinegar reaction I have not seen with Calcarea.

211
00:33:56,850 --> 00:34:05,990
It's very interesting but I have not seen it, but we have it in mind, if we see it again.

212
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:16,350
-A general question. If you could influence the remedy with your mind or with your wish?

213
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:25,350
For instance she said, not her but generally when we say, I tried not to eat this or I tried to eat fruit,

214
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:35,700
if then I can avoid to get in an Ignatia state with my will power, if I can influence this.

215
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:43,520
-If you can influence the reaction or the remedy or if you can influence your organism?

216
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:53,350
Your organism you can influence with your mind anytime. That means you can suppress emotions,

217
00:34:53,450 --> 00:35:01,350
you can suppress pain, you can do a lot of things with your mind, sure, there is no question,

218
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:03,200
nobody will argue about that.

219
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:09,200
We know it very well because that is how the Nat. mur. state...

220
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,120
I will answer your question.

221
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:16,770
I take it logically, so you understand what I will say.

222
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:29,270
The Nat. mur. will influence, I must not cry, I must not cry and they do not cry.

223
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:39,520
That influences the organism and they don't cry and the get cystitis or gastritis, whatever.

224
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:52,440
So that means when they take the remedy, the organism is strengthened and still if the individual

225
00:35:52,540 --> 00:36:01,270
is very powerful in their minds, they can still influence the organism not to express in the way

226
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:05,270
the organism wants to express because the organism wants to cry.

227
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:12,690
If you don't allow the organism to cry, like she said, I cried for the first time in my life I cried

228
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:21,940
under this stress which I had. If she did not allow it because she feels, I'm ridiculous I'm crying,

229
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:33,810
I'm this, then she would have some other form of depression or whatever she may develop.

230
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:39,260
Under the influence of the remedy you can still do it but not so easy.

231
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:45,180
The organism is more powerful and wants his own way of expression.

232
00:36:45,280 --> 00:37:02,180
So you can really with very strong individuals but I told you the case of a man who came

233
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:13,310
he was a secret agent from CIA, he came very tough man who resisted the remedy actually.

234
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:28,680
He said, I have been to the biggest doctors, I was 25 in a little apartment in Athens in 1970,

235
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:35,930
as he was relating to me afterwards.

236
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:43,590
He comes the first month, how are you? The same. He comes second month, how are you? The same.

237
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:52,260
I didn't change the remedy of course. He comes the third month and he brought I remember,

238
00:37:52,360 --> 00:38:00,110
a ring with diamond for my wife and he says, I couldn't believe it.

239
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:20,510
I have all this addiction with Valium, he was living on Valium and that I could be able to free myself,

240
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:29,760
I would be able to travel wherever I like, anyhow. You can influence but not so easily

241
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:33,680
as when you are sick.

242
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:41,580
And the more sick you are, the more you can interfere with the functions of the body,

243
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,680
you have to remember that.

244
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:52,090
If you interfere with the functions, they are going to have a repercussion because the organism knows

245
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:55,930
how to rearrange the things inside.

246
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:09,330
That does not mean of course that every time you get crossed you just throw a cup of hot tea

247
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:12,680
in the face of the person.

248
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:29,330
-I want to say something. After aspirin and pain killers I have dizziness and after any kind

249
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:31,930
of antibiotic, I have dizziness.

250
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:41,580
I feel like I'm fainting, something like that and I want to put that question

251
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:46,630
if I need anesthesia, what will happen?

252
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:51,850
-After Calcarea you will have no problem.

253
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:03,240
Show me the last repertorization.

254
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:45,620
So definitely the repertorization goes towards the Calc. carb. the whole picture is Calc. carb.

255
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:54,210
then we can give it. What potency? Very high.

256
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:13,460
Who says 30? 200? 1M? 10M? 50M? CM?

257
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:32,110
I would like to give only 200, the reason is that there is missing still some sweet

258
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:34,910
and the sensitivity to cold.

259
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:45,570
These two little things which are missing I would like to be on the safe side.

260
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:50,690
-But she has cold feet.

261
00:41:50,790 --> 00:42:02,700
-Yes, cold feet are there but sensitivity to cold in general. Cal. carb. is cold remedy.

262
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:13,690
The perspiration in the back is missing. So therefore we go with 200, maybe later on

263
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:22,190
if she goes with more clear picture and after all her problems now are on the physical level.

264
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:28,680
Her problems are not mental problems. It's not mental depression we have to treat where

265
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,780
we have to go really very high.

266
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:36,780
One time.

267
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:45,010
-This extreme tiredness for which she needs 10 days to recover, is that also Calcarea?

268
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:59,930
-Another point of Calc. carb. yes. Worse exertion. If you put this also in repertorization

269
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:05,430
that will also make it stronger, that's exactly, that's the idea.

270
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:10,680
So the organism needs the absorption of calcium, she needs to absorb and

271
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:24,030
she needs to utilize calcium much better than she does. Very good observation.

272
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:38,430
-In this case now that you said that this organism needs calcium, would you also suggest

273
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:40,930
diet changes, so that there will be more calcium?

274
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:49,930
-No. Dietary changes will do very little. It will ameliorate a little bit the situation but will not

275
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:59,200
correct the problem in a deeper level. Calc. carb. definitely will.

276
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:24,810
-After a week that I took Calc. carb. I had a terrible quarrel with my boss and I think I

277
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:37,580
antidoted because we shouted each other for half an hour and I was very nervous and I came home

278
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:44,310
and I was so nervous that I couldn't cry.

279
00:44:49,200 --> 00:45:01,700
It was something incredible, I was so angry and I think I antidoted because I don't feel anything.

280
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:17,980
After 2 weeks I decided to repeat Calcarea and after 2 weeks I had another quarrel with my boss

281
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,920
in the same manner.

282
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:27,420
-It's very good when you want to have a quarrel, you just take a dose of Calcarea.

283
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:35,170
-So since then I live every day in a stress.

284
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:40,570
-He is pressurizing you?
-Yes very much.

285
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:50,070
He wants me to throw out and I didn't want to and the idea was that I leave when I want,

286
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:52,420
not when he wants.

287
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:07,000
He does anything he can to make me very nervous and angry.

288
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,400
-He is a director in the hospital?

289
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:29,500
-No, he is a director at the factory and I'm a doctor there and now he is my boss.

290
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:36,150
-I see and he creates problems.
-Many problems.

291
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:39,250
-Every day?
-Every day.

292
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:44,850
-And how you react? You react again in the same manner like the first time?

293
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:57,650
-When I am at work I was calm and I didn't show any reaction or emotion or anger but

294
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:04,750
when I come home I'm very upset and angry and furious.

295
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:12,750
-But the first time you said you quarrel with him, that means you shouted him also.

296
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:18,850
-I shouted to him and he shouted to me, at the same time.

297
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:26,000
-And when you went home you felt you did not say enough or what?

298
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:32,850
-I don't know, I was too angry and trembling.

299
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:37,250
-And the second time the same thing happened?
-Yes.

300
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:38,500
-You shouted, he shouted.

301
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:52,850
-Yes, it's for the first time that I can shout to somebody who is superior, this is for the first time.

302
00:47:54,360 --> 00:48:03,850
-This is very good, it's healthy.
-So I don't know how much...

303
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:16,000
-We will find out. You want to say something else that has happened?

304
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:35,020
-Yes, in this period I have edema at the ankles very big edema, especially when I sit for a long time

305
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:47,220
or when I travel. They go for 2-3 weeks, so it's a long period with edema.

306
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:55,620
-If the edema comes, then it stays for 2-3 weeks before it goes away?

307
00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:01,550
-Yes and it's so big that I feel the skin cracks.

308
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:19,730
-You did not have this before? You had it less?

309
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:30,240
-I had it but it was for a short time, 2-3 days but now it stays for long time.

310
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:45,400
-And this time the edema is bigger?
-Always it is bigger but for long time.

311
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,980
-With pain?
-No.

312
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:34,480
I developed great desire for fresh cream with sugar and bread. I eat kilos.

313
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,660
-You never did this before?
-Never.

314
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:53,980
I couldn't support fresh cream but now I eat kilos of this.

315
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:55,630
-What about milk?

316
00:50:55,730 --> 00:51:11,980
-No. 1 kilo in 1 year is enough for me and also desire for fish, I can eat every day fish.

317
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:18,230
Strong desire for fish and also coffee.

318
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:27,130
-Did you have coffee? 2-3 times? How many times you said?

319
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:32,960
-Coffee I had before I came here.

320
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:39,820
-But now did you drink?
-No, only when I came here on the road.

321
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:48,320
-So 2 or 3 times, I want to know if I'm correct in my perception.

322
00:51:50,810 --> 00:52:02,710
-2 bottles of 250, let's say half a kilo but only one spoon, so two spoons.

323
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:04,820
-So twice.

324
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:23,210
-Also I have ecchymosis which appears spontaneously and this summer

325
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:29,310
I had all the analysis and it was OK.

326
00:52:29,830 --> 00:52:33,070
-How many platelets?

327
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:43,060
-I don't know but it was normal. They appear spontaneously.

328
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:47,720
-Without knocking?
-Without.

329
00:52:52,970 --> 00:53:10,970
I have an allergy to wasps, I have constipation which is quite serious.

330
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:36,720
For about 1 year I have a sensation of rawness or some pain in the throat, it's almost permanent,

331
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:48,290
it's like a wound. At the beginning I said it's nothing but now...

332
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:51,640
-Now you see it stays for 1 year.

333
00:53:54,890 --> 00:54:15,290
-Yes. Sometimes I have, you know in my family history it is a lot of cancer and for a while

334
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:22,140
I think too much about this problem.

335
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:40,290
I don't if it is good or bad but sometimes I say, it is too much cancer in my family and it's not a fear,

336
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:42,390
I'm just thinking about it.

337
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:48,880
And that's it.

338
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:56,030
-I want to ask some questions. You said, you quarrel with your boss, what about your husband?

339
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:57,810
-No, it's OK.

340
00:54:57,910 --> 00:54:59,560
-The relationship is good?

341
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:09,160
-Yes, he supports me all the time and he said, I can not imagine how you can resist in such a stress.

342
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:15,960
He supports me a lot.

343
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:26,190
-Something else. Do you have a child or do you want to become pregnant,

344
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:29,540
do you take precautions?
-No, I don't take anything.

345
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:47,780
-In general the temperature of your body has remained the same as before?

346
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:58,880
-It's a little warmer. I didn't realize myself but the others observed that I'm warmer.

347
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:07,780
-Did you have occasions where the warmth even bothered you?

348
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:09,780
-I didn't understand.

349
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,930
-For instance here or when you were in Romania, did you have occasions where the weather

350
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:24,130
was warm, that this bothered you?
-No, I can stay under the sun with no problem.

351
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:27,950
-And the warm does not aggravate you.
-Yes.

352
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:44,250
-Do you take butter?

353
00:56:44,350 --> 00:57:00,750
-No occasionally and cheese also, only fresh cream with sugar but I have no desire for sweets,

354
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:03,610
only for this kind.

355
00:57:08,610 --> 00:57:12,600
-Ice-cream?
-Yes occasionally.

356
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:27,420
-Not something special. Here I have noted before that vinegar aggravated you very much

357
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:33,050
this still stays?
-Yes and it's strong.

358
00:57:34,770 --> 00:57:39,560
-And the ecchymosis was before, it's more now or it's less?

359
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:41,190
-No, it's the same.

360
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:49,310
-You have reported some finger, in the joints of your finger, it's not there?

361
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:50,910
-No.

362
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:56,810
-Also fear of being alone in the night you have reported.

363
00:57:56,910 --> 00:58:00,400
-I don't know now because I'm not alone.

364
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:06,560
-Also you have reported swelling in the eyes, especially in the morning.

365
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:07,660
-No.

366
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:18,910
-Feet cold in bed you have reported.
-Sometimes but it's not so cold.

367
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:26,040
-The leucorrhea you have reported.
-Yes it is and it is a lot.

368
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:29,800
-It is more?
-Yes it is more.

369
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:36,650
-What is its consistence?
-It is yellow and thick.

370
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:50,960
-I want to ask you now how is your sexual desire?
-It's great. I don't want to change.

371
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:59,220
-OK. Also you had reported fear in narrow places.

372
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:16,390
-Yes I have it. I observe that I can not go into elevator; in some I enter but in others no.

373
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:17,480
It depends.

374
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:24,130
-Also you have reported fear from high places, it might still be there?

375
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:25,190
-Yes.

376
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:31,800
-And stitching pain in sternum.
-No this has gone.

377
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:34,300
-Also cramps in legs with stretching.

378
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:43,300
-Yes these are still there and especially in the night and they are more painful.

379
00:59:49,650 --> 01:00:06,980
I observed last week these cramps in the day when I walk, when I stay, it doesn't matter.

380
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:12,060
They are not only in the night, now they are in the day also.

381
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:21,310
-After exertion?
-No, just walk or stay and they appear.

382
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:51,210
-Desire for salt has increased at all?

383
01:00:51,310 --> 01:01:01,560
-No. I can say it appeared but not very strong, the desire for spicy food.

384
01:01:05,350 --> 01:01:09,460
-Your nails are strong?
-No.

385
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:12,810
-They break easily?
-No but they are soft.

386
01:01:42,890 --> 01:01:45,290
What shall we do in this case?

387
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:52,640
-Wait.
-Wait.

388
01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:58,480
-Shall we give Apis? Swelling of ankles?
-No.

389
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:02,410
-Medorrhinum? Swelling of ankles?
-No.

390
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:05,630
-Pulsatilla?
-No.

391
01:02:05,730 --> 01:02:07,730
-Maybe.

392
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:18,710
-Very good, you are learning. Let's see the repertorization. If you go to the repertorization you

393
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:26,720
will see something which is interesting.

394
01:02:29,470 --> 01:02:31,370
-Ah...

395
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:40,460
-Still Calc. carb. is on the top, shall we repeat Calc. carb.?

396
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:52,390
She says, I don't know if it's antidoted, maybe it is antidoted. Shall we repeat Calc. yes or no?

397
01:02:53,130 --> 01:03:00,630
Who says yes, he will justify it, who says no, he will also justify it. Who says no?

398
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:15,030
I also have the impression that there is still a lot of movement in the case, especially on

399
01:03:15,130 --> 01:03:16,910
the mental and emotional level.

400
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:27,030
I think it's a great development that she has the courage to withstand her boss in such a clear,

401
01:03:27,130 --> 01:03:28,650
straight and direct manner.

402
01:03:34,130 --> 01:03:46,310
-You talk Causticum. Hit him, kill him!

403
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:59,260
Any other wants to justify why she should not take Calcarea carb.?

404
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:05,010
-I think if she had antidoted with the coffee, we have to wait for relapse

405
01:04:05,110 --> 01:04:07,360
and now there is no relapse.

406
01:04:12,030 --> 01:04:20,200
-The main reason is very practical, very down-to-earth. Because she is getting warmer.

407
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:28,350
The fact that she is getting warmer and her feet are getting warmer forbids you

408
01:04:28,450 --> 01:04:31,730
from repeating Calc. carb.

409
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:38,090
All other things, even if there is something in process, you still may repeat,

410
01:04:38,190 --> 01:04:45,610
in case she was cold, feet cold, perspiring, you could have repeat it.

411
01:04:46,110 --> 01:04:55,760
The fact that she has become warmer, the feet especially, they are not as cold as before

412
01:04:55,860 --> 01:05:06,930
that is an indication that you must not give Calcarea and all the other symptoms

413
01:05:07,030 --> 01:05:11,780
are not enough to give us a clear picture of another remedy.

414
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:20,440
-I think too the discharges are going worse, it's a sign of no remedy, leucorrhea and swelling.

415
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:25,680
-Exactly, also the fact that it is discharging with leucorrhea quite a lot,

416
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:29,780
you allow it to happen as much as possible.
