1
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,720
-Tell me what happened?
-I have an acute lumbago.

2
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,870
-You had it before?

3
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:45,870
-No, it's started in the noon break. I had little tension and pain since the morning

4
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:51,120
but in the forenoon break, I bowed down to get something from the floor

5
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,870
and it was like a strong shooting pain.

6
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:55,870
-Where exactly?

7
00:00:55,970 --> 00:01:02,470
-In the right side of the lumbar sacral region.

8
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:23,550
-Can you exactly show me where is the pain?
-Here.

9
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:35,830
-You showed a little bit higher than the sacro-iliac junction.

10
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:45,300
Is this the pain?
-No, it's a little bit higher.

11
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:57,780
-Does it extend to the right foot?
-No, not at all.

12
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,320
-It's only on a point?

13
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:09,700
-It's an area but the most pain is to a point, I can localize the pain to a point but

14
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:22,950
the whole area is. Tonight I didn't sleep out of two reasons.

15
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:32,950
One was that I have a strange thing, when I get tired in the evening, I have about 15 min.

16
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:39,800
to go to bed. If I don't do it, it may happen that I don't sleep.

17
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,300
And that happened yesterday.

18
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,720
-Due to the pain?
-No, there was no pain.

19
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,120
-You just did not sleep immediately and therefore you stayed for the whole night.

20
00:02:55,220 --> 00:03:01,720
-Yes, I slept with my wife yesterday and that's why, I overdid it.

21
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:05,720
-And you were excited and you could not sleep?

22
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:17,370
-Yes I was excited for another reason. Yesterday evening my wife told me that a man here

23
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:30,590
had fallen in love with her and I don't know, it bothered me a little bit

24
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:36,130
because I was thinking what shall I do with this situation?

25
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:48,280
My wife is very stable with these things, I don't really worry but he went so far as to ask her

26
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:57,200
to kiss him, so I'm not sure that this is connected but it was strange that

27
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,800
I didn't have this before.

28
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:12,700
My wife she just said that she is confused by the whole thing and a lot of thoughts run through

29
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:32,050
her mind and I was worried how to help her, how to help him because he is in a bad situation also.

30
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:45,800
-And you can not walk now?
-I can walk very carefully.

31
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:51,700
-You can not straighten your body?

32
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,920
-When I rise up like this it hurts and when I go forwards like this it starts hurting also.

33
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:07,360
To the left I can go all the way.

34
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:28,010
-And movement, like keep on walking, makes it worse?

35
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:36,510
-I think it makes it better because in the break I lied down for some time and then getting up

36
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:45,510
was a bit heavy. It was about 10 min. until I went to the toilet and I had to be quite careful

37
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:51,860
how to get up. After a while it was easier but still not very good.

38
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:08,360
-Do you have to turn while you lie?
-No, I better not. Just lie flat...

39
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,610
-It is the most comfortable?
-Yes.

40
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:18,090
-Rising from bed is very heavy?
-Very heavy.

41
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:23,090
I haven't really found out the way to do it because just a very small movement will bring

42
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:29,510
a strong shooting pain again and I really don't know which movement to do,

43
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,110
I haven't found out yet.

44
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:40,510
-Do you feel any hot or cold applications will help?

45
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:48,240
-I don't think so. The only thing that I felt comfortable was when I put my feast and

46
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,830
put pressure on the point here.

47
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,540
-Do you usually take a lot of salt?
-No.

48
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:04,190
-On the contrary you don't like salt?

49
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:13,690
-I can eat salt but when I cook I don't use any salt because I don't need it but I have

50
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:16,540
no problem eating salty things.

51
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:24,290
-Your organism does not need salt.
-No.

52
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,690
-Are you thirsty person?

53
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:34,940
-I can forget to drink the whole day and it doesn't bother me.

54
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:41,700
When I'm working, like also here, I have a bottle and I drink all the time.

55
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,540
-Sips?
-Not just sips.

56
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,940
-So when you work you need liquid.

57
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:58,300
-I like it. I don't really need it, I can stay all day without drinking also.

58
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:07,260
-You are a cold person, a hot person, you are bothered by heat, by cold, by exposure to the sun?

59
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:19,360
-I'm bothered more by the heat, I'm more hot than cold. I can stand cold quite well I think.

60
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,210
-Sun?

61
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:32,610
-I get a sun stroke very easily so I have to wear a cap in the summer always.

62
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,760
-Do you drink milk?
-No, I don't like milk.

63
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:49,860
I eat muesli in the morning with fermented milk, a little bit sour milk but no more milk.

64
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,010
-Never? Never in your life?
-I don't like it.

65
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:59,010
-Do you know why? They gave you too much?

66
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:07,110
-No, I get the connection with the cow. It's disgusting.

67
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:12,680
-There are some people sometimes you don't like?

68
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:19,530
You have an aversion?
-I don't think so.

69
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:32,030
-Which remedy I'm thinking?
-I'm a beginner.

70
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,920
-I want to know if you control the interrogation.

71
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,840
-I am in homeopathic treatment.

72
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,070
-What remedies you have taken?

73
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:02,170
-I don't know the remedy that I'm given since 4 years.

74
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:25,260
-Do you suffer with hemorrhoids?
-Very seldom I have a little bit of blood.

75
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,660
-What remedies you have taken so far?

76
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:44,340
-Right now I'm in treatment since 1995 and I don't know the remedy.

77
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:51,840
I receive one dose about every 5 months but I don't know the remedy.

78
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,260
-Are you German?
-Austrian.

79
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:03,910
Before I was in treatment with the same doctor and he gave me for a long time Pulsatilla,

80
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,290
which helped.

81
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:13,650
He gave me one time in the beginning Tuberculinum but then I don't know what

82
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:26,900
other remedy. I tried Pulsatilla myself once in 1994 and I took it too often

83
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,400
and a autoimmunity disease came out.

84
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:38,450
-What?
-Lichen sclerosus e atrophicus.

85
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:51,320
It's the mucus membrane either oral or genital gets sclerosis and atrophy and shrinks

86
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:57,450
and I have this since 1995. That's why I'm in treatment.

87
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,650
-How is that now?

88
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:10,250
-It's in a standstill and it's not bothering me as much as it did.

89
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:29,400
I have it in my glands in me penic, it's underneath and it's shrinking so much that in the intercourse

90
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:39,670
was very painful and the mucus membrane would split up and was very painful.

91
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:49,070
It has been progressing even during the treatment but there was always aggravation.

92
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:55,320
It would become very hard like a cartilage and then it would become soft again

93
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,600
and I would have no pain.

94
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:05,450
Right now it's in a standstill and I can live with it.

95
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:16,250
-Do you consider yourself as closed, open person?
-Closed.

96
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,510
-Very close?

97
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:29,260
-With people that are intimate to me, good friends I'm open but the second reason that

98
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,860
I'm in treatment is a kind of social phobia .

99
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:41,250
Every time that are more than 2-3 people I get cranked up and I have lodged big problems

100
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:49,600
with that and it's getting a little bit better by the treatment but it's not really satisfactory.

101
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:03,020
-Do you feel fear or you don't know exactly why you have cramps?

102
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:10,570
-I don't know, it's more like a state that comes over me.

103
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:13,490
-It's like timidity.

104
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:25,660
-I was timid since I was a child but then I was 13 this thing started and I begun to shake

105
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:37,070
in front of the class, my neck begun to cramp whenever people's attention was on me.

106
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:49,560
I don't know, maybe this is a long story, I don't know if I should explain this.

107
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,810
This is an acute case.

108
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:03,140
-It's an acute case which if it's correct, it's going to cure you.

109
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,790
You never took Nat. muriat?

110
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:21,370
-No, except the last remedies I don't know what my doctor has been giving me.

111
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,620
-Ignatia you took ever?
-No.

112
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,220
-Do you like fruits?
-I like fruits.

113
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,090
-Sweets?
-Yes, I eat them, I don't need them.

114
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,680
-It's not important.

115
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:47,850
-Milk I can drink but I wouldn't go myself to the fridge and take milk.

116
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:55,850
-But if you have to drink it, will you drink it?
-Yes, I'll be polite and drink it.

117
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:07,500
-What did you study? Are you medical doctor?
-Yes.

118
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,200
-You have a speciality?

119
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:22,160
-I practice as general practitioner since 2 years and in my practice I do only Homeopathy

120
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,510
and I work night shifts.

121
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:31,800
-Are you still used to work a lot?
-Yes, I think so.

122
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:42,180
-Is it possible to urinate in front of other people?

123
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:52,910
-No, that's something that has come up since 1996. It started in Germany, I was in a course

124
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:56,600
and it started there and since then I haven't really tried it.

125
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:02,000
-You haven't tried ever again. It was embarrassing for you?

126
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,180
-Yes.

127
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:16,830
-Do you ever get cracks in your lips?
-No.

128
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:21,430
-Do you get herpes? Blisters?
-No.

129
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:34,110
-When you say easy sun stroke, you mean real sun stroke or some dizziness from the sun

130
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:36,580
and you get headache?

131
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:42,440
-I get dizzy first, then I get nauseous and maybe a headache also.

132
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,430
But mostly dizziness and nausea.

133
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:58,100
-After how long staying under the sun?
-Without cap maybe half an hour under strong sun.

134
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,190
-OK.

135
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:49,440
-That was a quick case for finding his constitutional remedy.

136
00:18:53,690 --> 00:19:05,500
The fact that the first thing he says is, when I put my fist I feel released, I put this

137
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:11,600
hard pressure on the point it is either Rhus tox or Nat. mur.

138
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,240
These two remedies should come to your mind.

139
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:25,340
Then the sensitivity to the sun takes you straight to Nat. mur.

140
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:36,990
Then further the closeness of the person it is more Nat. mur. and I don't know if he is given already

141
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:45,740
Nat. mur., in which case we have to give a very high potency of Nat. mur. in order to cover up

142
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:52,490
in case he is given already Nat. mur. he needs Nat. mur.

143
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:59,990
Plus the fact that he was under some stress, some grief because of the incident with his wife.

144
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:06,600
So all this together makes a case of Nat. mur. 50M. Thank you.

145
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,380
-No problem that he needs no salt?
-No problem.

146
