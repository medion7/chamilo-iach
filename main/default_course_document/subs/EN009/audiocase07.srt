1
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:28,120
I want to present to you now another case of our contemporary disease...

2
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,610
-AIDS

3
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:40,180
-What else? A case of AIDS.

4
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:51,270
-In February 1951, the consultation was on 24th of March 1987,

5
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:56,100
he is diagnosed as having HIV and was infected three years ago;

6
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,350
he had only known it for three months when he came for the first consultation.

7
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:05,850
She noticed that the eyes were very red, his face was very pale.

8
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:10,620
He had never had any venereal disease but possible he had hepatitis B

9
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,350
about two years beforehand, without any symptoms.

10
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:19,100
He had the flu twice four years previously and he had taken penicillin.

11
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,100
He had swelling of the glands in the anus in which he was given antibiotics.

12
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:34,600
The reaction to the HIV diagnosis was over-activity; he felt very much in a hurry

13
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,700
and everything had to be done right now.

14
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,850
-When this happened?

15
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:44,930
-The diagnosis was three months before March this year and when he got the diagnosis

16
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:53,160
he felt he had to do everything now, he has to see all his friends, he has to rush

17
00:01:53,260 --> 00:02:00,510
and do things. He says he feels very restraint because of the diagnosis.

18
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:04,680
He has never had any high ambitions, he said he is an messy type.

19
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:10,430
-He feels he is restraint because they have told him he has AIDS and he cannot...

20
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,260
-I'm not sure what that means.

21
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:30,630
I have to explain to you this practitioner is reading the report of the doctor

22
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:35,620
from another country, this is in London because the doctor has not come

23
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:42,940
and reads the report of the doctor who attended the case first, in another country.

24
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,180
So she is not the direct practitioner.

25
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,330
-He has irregularly eating and living habits and lives a very hectic life style.

26
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:10,210
Desires salt one underline, alcohol one underline, oranges two underlines and dry food,

27
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,580
thirst one underline he has a glass of water on his bedroom table.

28
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:24,180
People see him as being gross and uncompromising one underline, egotistic.

29
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:34,660
He gets very angry when he hears about unfairness, he calls himself a moralist

30
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:49,680
which means he is against conservatism and conventional morals,

31
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:55,160
he is not fastidious, he is rather untidy, he is very seldom cold

32
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:01,410
but lately his feet have  been cold, he always had to sleep in a cold room before

33
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:08,520
but recently he is been leaving a heater at night and he put the cover around himself.

34
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,920
He works in a restaurant and in a local radio station at night,

35
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:18,420
he likes to see the things been done, he is very good at his work,

36
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:24,410
fear of water two underlines, he learned to swim two years ago but he had to force himself

37
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,770
to overcome that fear,

38
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:32,920
he can have some sticking stomach pain and sticking pain from the back,

39
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:40,910
he had swelling of the glands under both ears and in the back of the neck when he went in March

40
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:46,420
and he had some flashes of heat during the night before he had the diagnosis.

41
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,520
He was given Nux vomica 200 and 1M.

42
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:57,420
He telephoned on the 4th of April about a week later and said that after the Nux vomica

43
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,440
he slept for 10 hours, then he was up for 5 hours and then he slept for another 10 hours

44
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:09,670
and he felt more calm and that the pain in his shoulder and neck had gone.

45
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:14,000
After the Nux vomica he developed pain in the tendons of the right heel,

46
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:20,350
which he feels when standing on the foot and he felt an increased desire for fresh air.

47
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:26,750
He came again a month after the Nux vomica and she reported that he looked much better

48
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:31,250
and the redness had gone from around the eyes and the swelling under the ears

49
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:35,440
had also cleared up but he was getting more pains in the glands of the neck

50
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:43,770
and a new symptom that he developed was headache in the occiput, coming and going.

51
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:53,920
He reported that he had two warts on the right first finger which he hadn't notice before,

52
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,850
I don't know if they are knew and also some spots on the finger nails.

53
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:06,690
He hates to get up in the morning and the pain which came after Nux vomica remains.

54
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,640
That's the case.

55
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:13,500
-Did he have examinations from the hospital?
-He didn't send them.

56
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:32,760
This case is under the supervision of the hospital of the country, which is dealing with AIDS cases.

57
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:41,760
-Who diagnosed it?
-This is the Health Authorities of Oslo.

58
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:52,190
-Do you know what kind of examinations they did?
-Blood tests and they found antibodies.

59
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:55,490
They haven't found the virus but they found the antibodies.

60
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:59,330
-What about the lymphocytes?

61
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:08,920
-Yes that was on the examination, they found some irregularities.

62
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:27,240
They found some nodes here and I had read, I was very concerned about this disease

63
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:36,170
and I thought that maybe this is the HIV virus, so I went to the examination and it was.

64
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,170
But that was the only symptoms.

65
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:48,320
-In the blood test they examined the T-lymphocytes, have they given you any information

66
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,340
of how they are?

67
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:57,150
-The only thing I know is that they found the antibodies, that they cannot find

68
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:08,340
any irregularities in my blood, that's all I know. But I have the papers from the laboratories.

69
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,840
What does he think?

70
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:34,090
His look what it tells you?

71
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:55,090
His look in the eyes?
-Doubting.

72
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:01,340
-Critical and challenging.
-Fear.

73
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,340
-The most is fear.

74
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:17,170
Fear about the disease, it's natural you will say but it is depicted in his face the fear.

75
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:34,320
There is an intensity, a fear and an intensity what is going to happen and on a second level

76
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:41,920
there is doubt, suspicion, what you said is correct but the first is fear.

77
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:50,090
What we call severe anxiety about health, it's natural.

78
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,520
It doesn't matter whether it's natural or not, we see it.

79
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:59,620
Because he has AIDS it means that naturally he will have anxiety about health?

80
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:07,020
Do you think that someone because he has AIDS automatically he has anxiety about health?

81
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,890
-No.

82
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:13,280
-No. You can see AIDS people where they don't care.

83
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:33,030
He is a homosexual, as you understood. Who understood he is a homosexual?

84
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:43,780
All the women. He has no signs.

85
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:52,680
-These are not good photocopies. They are not good.

86
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:57,540
You don't have good photocopy machine in Norway?

87
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:05,040
-They don't have much money because of political situations.

88
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:16,460
Do you hear that? I said they are not good copies, I could hardly read them,

89
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,810
I could not understand and what is his comment?

90
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:27,540
They don't have enough money, this country does not have enough money.

91
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:34,040
It is one of the richest countries but what he says is because of political reasons...

92
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,900
That means they don't want to spend money on people.

93
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:44,890
You get the impression? You see his attitude?

94
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:49,800
This bloody government does not want to spend money on people.

95
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:57,290
People are dying, they are very sick and still they are afraid to spend a little money

96
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:12,300
on photocopies. You got it? He had to say that. He has to make a comment.

97
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:17,270
It is not accidental that he makes a comment. It is the type.

98
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:25,020
Lachesis would respond in that way, Stramonium in another way, Belladonna in another way.

99
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,770
He has to make a comment.

100
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:35,760
Do you think that this is a Nat mur case?
-No.

101
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:43,870
-Why not? He looks like Nat mur, he is very sensitive, why not?

102
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,260
-He makes that comment.

103
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:52,260
-Because he makes this comment, a Nat mur will be very difficult to make that comment

104
00:12:52,360 --> 00:13:03,360
and to make these grimaces in front. He has to be somebody who is rather open and communicative.

105
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:16,940
Nat mur, Ignatia, Staphysagria they will not. Phosphoric acid is too tired to talk, Stannum also.

106
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,220
Do you see the differential diagnosis?

107
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:38,580
-I'm here because I've been given money to have this trip covered but I have to make a report

108
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:45,340
of what is going on here. So since they are so many microphones, may I put on my microphone

109
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,020
for this conversation is also taped? I don't have to take notes?

110
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:56,860
-Usually we don't allow this but you can do it.

111
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,860
Do you see? Did you understand?

112
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:12,610
This is not to play game. It says either you cure me or I will report it to the government.

113
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:17,760
He has given money by the government to come to London and to be treated by me.

114
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:23,020
So what he says is you better be serious about it, I don't play around.

115
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:35,430
You got it? he says. It's a mild threat. I represent to him the conservatism.

116
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:45,430
I'm the authority to him, so he threatens but very mildly because he knows how much

117
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:51,950
he depends on me at the same time. I may show him the door out.

118
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,780
-You can do it.
-Thank you.

119
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:12,420
All this is very important for me. For you maybe it would just pass unnoticed but I perceive

120
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:20,370
everything. I see his anxiety, his fear, his intensity, the kind of comment he made.

121
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:27,770
What he says now, how he says it.

122
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:37,600
At a certain moment, as soon as he became aware of the camera, he was a little bit...

123
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,350
but then he came back, it doesn't matter, I'm in front of the camera but it doesn't matter.

124
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:49,850
All this it is registered because I'm aware, I have to find the remedy.

125
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:57,600
Unfortunately in Homeopathy don't expect that it's going to be a routine.

126
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:02,700
Routine you can forget. It is every day, every time a challenge.

127
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:10,010
What is now this case? What is the remedy? That is the fascination about Homeopathy.

128
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:20,110
It will never let you sleep peacefully. You always think what about that case?

129
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:27,110
Is it going to go well? And you always have some cases at stake.

130
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,400
-By whom you have been given the money?

131
00:16:50,500 --> 00:17:03,600
-By a gay organization in Oslo, which has charity concert going on,

132
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:15,780
collecting money for the HIV positive and I've been given the trip to London from that fund.

133
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:26,290
-Can I keep this?
-Of course, it's for you.

134
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:37,690
-You said that the medical report is by Oslo health...

135
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:43,340
-It's the Community Health Department of Oslo.

136
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,030
-The official?
-Yes, it's not the country but the Oslo.

137
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:56,590
-The patient first consulted us on 04-1984 complaining for other discomfort

138
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:59,350
and pains like fatigue and fever.

139
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:10,380
Clinical findings; swollen lymph glands approximately one by 0,5 cm in the anus left side...

140
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,420
of minor glands in both armpits.

141
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:22,350
Colonoscopy showed injected mucus membranes with pus treated as gonorrhoic proctitis.

142
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:29,610
Antibodies positive on hepatitis B, negative on antigens, no history related to hepatitis,

143
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:40,740
no other serious illness. Back in January 87 for HIV antibody test have noticed

144
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:46,240
swollen lymph glands on the left side of neck and slight soreness of throat,

145
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:51,520
clinical findings pea-sized gland left side of neck below ear,

146
00:18:51,620 --> 00:19:04,980
laboratory test showed HIV antibody test positive, on the second test at the 6th of February 87,

147
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:13,060
all other lab findings within normal ranges, retrospective testing of frozen plasma

148
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:22,160
from 1984 shows slight positive reaction of HIV antibodies.

149
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:28,300
He was probably infected before December 84. He is clinically in good health

150
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,410
and coping well with this situation.

151
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:41,480
You see because the report was coming to me it was written clinically he is doing well.

152
00:19:54,730 --> 00:20:01,410
-What I would like you to tell me first is how many times you have been treated in your

153
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,740
life and for what?

154
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:16,730
-I've never been seriously ill. So it depends on what range...

155
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:22,470
-Here it writes that you have been treated for gonorrhoic proctitis.

156
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:28,970
-Oh yes this is the Journal from the Health Department of venereal diseases in Oslo.

157
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,470
-For how long you took antibiotics?

158
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:39,230
-Yes I have taken antibiotics for this in anus, whatever it was.

159
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:52,100
This is the first mentioned, so it is not in the Journal, this disappeared

160
00:20:52,200 --> 00:21:05,200
after I used the antibiotic, which I don't remember the name of.

161
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:17,790
-How long you used the antibiotics?
-It was one. Tablets.

162
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,690
-For how many days?

163
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:26,630
-I don't remember, it was just given, I took it and then it disappeared.

164
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:30,380
-For how many days?
-I don't remember, sorry.

165
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:40,030
-It was the first time that you took antibiotics?
-I have taken antibiotics before.

166
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:46,130
-For what reason?
-For swollen throat, living in Paris.

167
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:53,850
I took twice one winter and what happened in my childhood I'm not able to say

168
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:59,800
but I was often an ill child with often colds.

169
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:09,050
I remember one serious illness from my point of view was when I had a headache.

170
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,690
-Frontal sinusitis?

171
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:23,190
-Yes which I tried to cure with medicine, it didn't help and I went to homeopath at that time

172
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:27,530
and it didn't help either but it just disappeared.

173
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,550
So maybe it was the homeopathy, I know now.

174
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:41,870
-You are now 30?
-36.

175
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,020
-You are homosexual?
-Yes.

176
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:57,620
-At what age you became active?
-About the age of 22-23.

177
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:04,870
-You have been very active sexually?

178
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:15,780
-I don't know what you learned but compared to what they write about 10 the night,

179
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:22,700
not at all, definitely not very active.

180
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:26,710
-Did you have a lot of partners?
-No.

181
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:34,960
-How many?
-A year? Maybe between 5-10.

182
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,710
Different persons.

183
00:23:53,710 --> 00:24:00,460
I'm not morally concerned about this. If I had thousands, I would say.

184
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:08,600
So that's no problem. But that was so strange because they say people are infected

185
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:15,460
by this virus by people who are over active and that's why there are so many in America.

186
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,700
-From your partners was anybody outside of Norway?

187
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:40,530
-Yes. I think a lot about work and my final answer now is that when I was in Paris

188
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:46,270
I had sex relationships with people I didn't know, in the same period in which

189
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:53,300
I was using the antibiotics for the throat.

190
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:56,450
-For how long you were using the antibiotics for the throat?

191
00:24:56,550 --> 00:25:01,440
-It was twice the winter, so it was like I was buying tablets for...

192
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:07,540
-Almost constantly.
-Two weeks each, maybe.

193
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:16,150
-Did you feel that because you were taking antibiotics you were protected from infections?

194
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:20,860
-No, I didn't think that way.

195
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,610
-Just be honest. You didn't think now I'm taking the antibiotics,

196
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:28,860
therefore I do not have anything, it was not like that?

197
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,700
-No it's not like that. Now afterwards I've been thinking I might have been too weak

198
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:39,460
at that time because I was taking the antibiotics, after having read your book for instance.

199
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:50,160
Maybe I was in a weak situation that the virus would attack me.

200
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:54,880
Why I ask this question? What reason do I have to ask this question?

201
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:08,440
-To find out how long really he is taking the antibiotics trying to protect himself from the gonorrhoea.

202
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:13,200
-But what reason do I have to doubt what he is saying?

203
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:28,680
Isn't strange that he remembers that he was having sex in France five years ago

204
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:34,040
during the period he was taking the antibiotics? Isn't strange?

205
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:41,680
Usually you say antibiotics, when did I take it? I can't remember but now he remembers

206
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:47,020
that he took antibios during the period he was having sex in France.

207
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:56,420
What is the explanation? He gave a reason to himself to take antibiotics,

208
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:05,230
I have a sore throat, so he had a reason for taking antibios and at the same time

209
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:13,980
he thinks I better take antibiotics because I'm having some sex with people I don't know.

210
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:19,470
This is the real story behind, according to me.

211
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:26,120
Of course he denies it but the way he denies somewhere in his subconscious

212
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:40,380
there is the same story, I do not want to push him too much but we have to be like detectives

213
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:44,700
and use our logic mind.

214
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:48,040
I have asked thousands of people when did you take antibiotics?

215
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:59,150
Nobody ever told me the time. They say it was a year, what year, not the month.

216
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:02,890
Now he remembers he took it during that period.

217
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:10,650
How this has remained to his mind? Because he had connect it, that's all.

218
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,650
-He tries to find out.

219
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,370
-If he had not connected it in his mind, he would not remember it.

220
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:38,980
The fact that he remembers it, is the fact that gives me... and also his reaction,

221
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:53,660
he says no, no. First he says yes and then words say no. It's not important.

222
00:28:54,150 --> 00:29:02,550
What is important is for you to observe and understand what I'm trying to say,

223
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:09,400
don't just let things go away like that and then you will know many things about the people.

224
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:17,790
You will know how they think, when they doubt, when they believe, when they are angry,

225
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:20,910
when they are going to sue you...

226
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:29,560
They are coming into the office and say here I am and you say oh my god,

227
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:34,150
he is going to sue me in America. You don't have it in Europe so much.

228
00:29:56,150 --> 00:30:03,120
-Maybe I was in a weak situation that the virus would attack me easily,

229
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,900
that's what I'm thinking now.

230
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:12,890
-What year it was?
-This was three years ago.

231
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:18,400
-84? 83?

232
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:23,800
He doesn't even remember the year, you see? He does not remember the year

233
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:27,900
but he remembers that he was taking antibiotics during the time he was having sex.

234
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,900
It's the same story exactly.

235
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:43,900
-Why did you go to Paris?
-I'm in a trip.

236
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:58,910
-Somebody likes to sail, somebody motor bikes, somebody goes for adventures?

237
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:05,960
-These too of course are always part of the game but still I travel a lot

238
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:12,960
because I like other cultures. Paris is not another culture exactly but I had a friend there,

239
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:17,300
I wanted to learn French, I went to school to learn French.

240
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:25,390
-So you had a boyfriend in Norway or in France, he invited you to France?

241
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:32,710
-This is a long story. I had a friend in Paris, I had no boyfriend in Norway.

242
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:37,970
I went to Paris because I wanted to do something else. I didn't have a steady job,

243
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:45,390
so why not to go to Paris, I had money and of course I was sexually active too.

244
00:31:54,320 --> 00:32:01,790
Going to Paris I had gone to many places with the friend in Paris, we went to Asia

245
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:03,900
because I met him there.

246
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:13,140
I'll ask you something else. I do not have a confirmation of what I'm asking you

247
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:18,870
on the video but just for the sake to see your observation.

248
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:23,570
What does he think about himself, about his appearance?

249
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:33,010
Can anybody tell me, is it obvious to you or you don't know?

250
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:45,520
-He likes himself.
-Haughty.

251
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:55,150
-Self-confident.
-Considerate.

252
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,400
-Women are very critical.

253
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:09,070
-He had done mistakes and he thinks about them now.

254
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:14,310
-I said how he thinks about his appearance?

255
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,820
-Content with himself.

256
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:35,780
-You see men are not responding. Women are responding but no one has told me

257
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,630
exactly how he feels.

258
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:49,620
-He is sexually attracted to you.
-To me? I never thought about it.

259
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:08,880
I never understand such implications, whether it's a woman or ...

260
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:20,610
It's a point which I would like to see if anybody can see.

261
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:25,700
If you were observant, you would have understood.

262
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:43,950
-Smiling like an actor.
-Yes, this remedy likes to act.

263
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:59,440
-Insecure.
-He wants to give a good picture of himself.

264
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:03,950
-What does he think about himself as an appearance?

265
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:21,440
-I think he is very good looking but he does not know whether he is good looking.

266
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,190
-I will give you now my observation.

267
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:49,950
This is a man who has a very good idea about his appearance.

268
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:56,280
He says I'm good looking except of one part. Which is that part?

269
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:02,680
Somebody says I'm good looking but I have a bad nose, I'm good looking

270
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:11,270
but I have bad eyebrows, I' m good looking but I would like to have a correction on that area.

271
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,530
Everyone has some idea, what is his problem?

272
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:40,780
-Mouth.
-The problem is his mouth.

273
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:50,770
He feels that he is good looking but his mouth is not good enough. Why?

274
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:57,700
Because you will see how many times he hides it.

275
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:14,170
If you have a part which you want to hide... if we put backwards the video,

276
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:21,900
I will show you how many times he bites his mouth and I don't remember if he will do it further.

277
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,970
Most probably he will do it because he is very conscious about his mouth.

278
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:31,820
Very conscious that his mouth is not perfect, everything else is perfect, he is content.

279
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:42,410
And further can you tell me what it says this kind of mouth?

280
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:55,910
Is it a strong mouth?
-No.

281
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:13,740
-Babyhood, immaturity. This is my observation.

282
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:25,140
I could not ask such questions but it would be interesting if you could take an intimate answer

283
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:29,320
from him to confirm these things.

284
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:36,330
I'm just telling these things to show you the sensitivity with which I'm observing.

285
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:51,810
I do not look at a picture, I look on a live thing and I understand different levels

286
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:53,410
which are existing.

287
00:38:56,410 --> 00:39:01,230
A human being thinks that he is closed and nobody can understand anything and

288
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:04,930
somebody else comes and reads everything and says, I will tell you your life.

289
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:09,790
You have done this, this and that's your life more or less.

290
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:13,790
Everybody understands these.

291
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,940
The only thing is that we don't say, we don't say it to ourselves,

292
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,530
we don't say it to others but everybody...

293
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,680
If I really press you and say, look and tell me, look and tell me,

294
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:29,040
you tell me finally the whole story.

295
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:34,180
Don't project, don't put your mind into explaining anything,

296
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:40,040
just look and tell me and you will see everything without prejudice. Just look.
