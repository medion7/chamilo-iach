1
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,650
-What is the problem?

2
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,470
-They told me that I've got multiple sclerosis.

3
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,090
-Who told you?

4
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:44,970
-At the hospital in Birmingham 14 days ago.

5
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,970
-Do you have a kind of written report?

6
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:51,540
-No.

7
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:51,840
-That was verbally?

8
00:00:51,940 --> 00:01:01,720
-Yes it was verbally because it was one person, they told me that I could expect it.

9
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:10,310
They weren't quite sure.

10
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,130
-Because you are too old for multiple sclerosis almost.

11
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:32,620
-They expect that I had it for 10 years at least.

12
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:39,870
Now it started with a different feeling here.

13
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:50,290
I asked these questions because he said he is 47 and usually the multiple sclerosis

14
00:01:50,390 --> 00:02:14,540
starts at the age of 14,15,16. Even in 15 it's very unusual.

15
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:26,620
-You had a numbed feeling in the inner side of the thighs?

16
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:36,630
-Yes. Then I had prostatitis.

17
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:51,450
-By the first time you had this numbness how long it lasted?

18
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:59,290
-That was 10 years ago and I believe it lasted for 2-3 months and I believe it was

19
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:11,620
something to do with the prostatitis. But they said it had nothing to do with that.

20
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,250
-When it was the prostatitis?

21
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:43,660
-In 1976. It lasted 400 days, more than one year.

22
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,350
-One year and two months.

23
00:03:55,350 --> 00:04:18,390
Here I don't know if you can see that he is dressed very untidy. The way he is dressed reminds me of Sulphur.

24
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:37,840
When he said that he took Sulphur drugs, I'm thinking now the way he dresses...

25
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:49,770
That means Sulphur in mother tincture has helped him but he has taken too much Sulphur.

26
00:04:52,700 --> 00:05:02,680
Most probably we have either to take away the effect of Sulphur drugs or maybe to help him

27
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:09,550
with the condition because the way he is looking...

28
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:21,520
His clothes are quite untidy.

29
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:39,320
I was thinking a perfect Sulphur picture in television is in a play called the 'odd couple' have you seen that play?

30
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:53,490
If you see this play there is a man there which is typical what we describe as Sulphur,

31
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:59,420
it is called the 'odd couple'.

32
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:29,600
Stoop shouldered like that, his friend came and tidy the place, he did not like it,

33
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:35,240
he was so irritated, he started throwing things,

34
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:43,640
he was enjoying life, very extroverted.

35
00:06:51,910 --> 00:07:01,400
Eventually when he orders some food, he says give me that fat, I want fat!

36
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:15,730
I said my god he is a perfect case of Sulphur.

37
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:25,990
It's very interesting if you want to see Sulphur, to see this movie.

38
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:39,810
-During that 10 year period you had not others?

39
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:46,890
-All the time.

40
00:07:51,500 --> 00:08:01,550
I had difficulty to sleep, during sleeping and I was sweating every night...

41
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:37,260
Now I'm almost sure that because he says I have difficulties all these years, I'm a hypochondriac

42
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:47,320
and then he says I'm sleepless. Sulphur is one of the main remedies that are sleepless.

43
00:08:52,070 --> 00:09:03,570
Sweating all night, sleeplessness and sweating, I said myself OK Sulphur but let us see.

44
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:21,450
-So all these years you were feeling awful, pains, sleeplessness, perspiration,

45
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:25,530
psychologically wise?

46
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:46,700
-Ups and downs, I have been happiest as well. I've got a son, it hasn't been that bad

47
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,280
10 years but...

48
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,440
-Health wise were bad.

49
00:09:52,540 --> 00:10:00,770
-Yes but I haven't been away from my job.

50
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:07,140
-What is that you teach?

51
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:16,120
-Mathematics.

52
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:36,600
-What other symptoms do you have in general? Now do you have sleeplessness?

53
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:54,220
-Yes, I get a feeling even in the finger tips that my heart is pumping and in the toes,

54
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,440
the whole body.

55
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:15,570
It started now 1-2 months ago this palpitation.

56
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:20,970
-Do you feel the pulse all over the body and it is mostly in the fingers.

57
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:33,970
-Yes but it changes, sometimes in the fingers, sometimes in the toes, sometimes in the stomach.

58
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:37,640
-Where do you feel numbness?

59
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:55,230
-Numbness in here, in the gums.

60
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,800
-Do you have any difficulty in walking?

61
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,350
-No.

62
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:08,100
-Running?

63
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:19,350
-Not particularly, I have some difficulties down here if I'm tired.

64
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:22,520
-What exactly?

65
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:36,180
-I feel my feet are not strong enough if I'm tired.

66
00:12:51,910 --> 00:13:00,160
Walking in the street sometimes I feel it, not now but I was in Spain for three weeks

67
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,370
and walking in the street I was aching in my legs.

68
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,850
-Other numbness in the face?

69
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,930
-Yes.

70
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,940
-Where?

71
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,770
-It started on the right side but now I got it in the left side as well?

72
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,350
-Is there any disturbance in your vision?

73
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:43,350
-Not now but I had the glasses last year.

74
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:47,970
-But do you have diplopia?

75
00:13:51,710 --> 00:14:00,190
-Not at all, I have been very carefully tested and it is normal.

76
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:07,440
-Except these antibiotics and these Sulphur drugs that you take for long,

77
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:11,310
have you ever taken other drugs for long time?

78
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,720
-Sleeping pills.

79
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:23,040
-How much? Do you take one pill every day?

80
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:42,890
-Oh yes and some years ago I took some anti-depressive but not very much.

81
00:14:45,100 --> 00:15:00,300
-Why?  That time you were going through a difficult period?

82
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,630
I do these questions to explore what happened

83
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:17,900
They have diagnosed multiple sclerosis and why? There must be some stimulus

84
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,060
to have such a serious disease. So I want to know from the pathology point of view.

85
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:34,420
To understand why this has developed.  I still do not question at all homeopathically.

86
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:53,580
To understand the development of the disease what happened historically.

87
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,420
Eventually later on I shall go to the homeopathic questions.

88
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:10,680
Before I understand how deep the disease is, how the pathology has developed

89
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:21,710
I will not go into homeopathic questions but already what do you observe in him?

90
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:33,110
I said from the beginning that this may be a Sulphur case.

91
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:44,560
Already now I have doubt. Why, can anybody tell me?

92
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:58,850
There is something in the character that does not give out Sulphur.

93
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:08,110
What is that element? Can anybody describe it?

94
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:20,110
That can be Sulphur.

95
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:26,940
-He is more modern.

96
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:46,930
-That's a good description, not so much extrovert, he is not coming out.

97
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:55,680
The extroversion of Sulphur even in the Norwegians will be prominent.

98
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:07,870
What do you observe in him?
'Yes' is more.

99
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:32,100
With Sulphur it is not so much 'yes'.What he thinks is right.

100
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:51,710
-What difficulties do you have? With the work, with your relatives?

101
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:58,640
-I was a student first time and then I had this

102
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:12,400
I was afraid that I can protrude my exam, I have perhaps been thinking too much.

103
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:24,320
That period I was a student, I was a happy man, outside.

104
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:33,680
I was around the whole Europe, tourist...

105
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:41,490
-During that period you had a lot of sexual activity also?

106
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:45,070
-Yes.

107
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:47,820
-Have you contracted any time any gonorrhea?

108
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,830
-No.

109
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:52,570
-Before that?

110
00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:07,970
-No. Once I was afraid that I could have and he treated me as I had.

111
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:14,460
-Why you were afraid, because somebody else had the same?

112
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:18,380
-No.

113
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:37,440
You see this information? By this time I was drinking a lot, then drinking Sulphur again.

114
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:42,430
Sulphur desires alcohol. Sulphur is one of the main remedies that you see in the Repertory

115
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:49,520
desires wine, desires beer, likes to drink, Sulphur again.

116
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:59,420
Then he tells me I was a tourist guide.

117
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:13,910
Then I perceive that he would have contact with tourist girls and too much activity,

118
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:19,570
perhaps the gonorrhea, perhaps Medorrhinum.

119
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:34,720
Then I asked him did you have a lot of activity? He says yes. Did you contract gonorrhea? No.

120
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:52,210
Then he said I thought I had gonorrhea but anyhow he asked the doctor to give him

121
00:21:52,310 --> 00:22:03,560
the treatment anyhow because he was afraid.

122
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:15,130
Now all this gives the information Sulphur maybe, Medorrhinum no.

123
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:21,410
Again another remedy which is what?

124
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:36,590
It has come before but I did not pay attention.

125
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:14,740
He says do I have gonorrhea? The doctor says no.

126
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:22,280
Then he is not satisfied and says why don't you treat me anyhow?

127
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:35,020
The doctor because he insisted, gave a series of antibiotics. That indicates a kind of anxiety.

128
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:52,660
Before what indicated that anxiety? What shows this anxiety?

129
00:23:52,760 --> 00:24:02,090
-It shows insecurity.

130
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:20,840
-No. This he does not know.

131
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:29,000
What he says is during the last 10 years I was not feeling well all the time and I was

132
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:38,430
going to the doctors and they could not find anything wrong with me and eventually

133
00:24:38,530 --> 00:25:02,230
I thought that I was hypochondriac, which is again an anxiety about health during these years.

134
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:09,980
So we got some hints now, not Medorrhinum, possibly Sulphur, let us see.

135
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:33,320
-Do you still have desire for alcoholic drinks?

136
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:42,160
-Now I don't think I have desire about. I don't drink now unless it is Saturday and we have

137
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:53,230
good dinner and a glass of wine but not very much. It's more a life style than a need.

138
00:25:53,330 --> 00:26:00,320
Of course I have lived in Kenya about two years and amongst the people I was working

139
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:12,510
there they used to drink more beer, they don't use much wine.

140
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:27,650
Of course it helped me to sleep, once in a while is good to sleep but only one glass it

141
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:33,150
makes me awake.

142
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:36,770
-You stay awake?

143
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:45,570
-Yes. Because I don't drink every day.

144
00:26:52,420 --> 00:27:00,660
What he said is also interesting that one glass will make him awake, one bottle will take him to sleep.

145
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:19,410
Wine gives energy, one glass of wine helps people with energy.

146
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:25,530
One bottle...

147
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:53,820
Why it is important? (?)

148
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:14,970
Why do I think that it is important what he says?

149
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:35,890
He is honest, he wants to be as much as possible accurate.

150
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:47,420
He could have hide the information, he does not hide the information.

151
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:55,590
What is again behind this idea, that he does not hide information?

152
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:59,250
-His anxiety.

153
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:15,020
-His anxiety to tell the truth (?) Therefore in spite of telling things that will not make him to look good,

154
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:21,900
he is honest.

155
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:51,800
In a consultation there is nothing that is left aside. Then eventually you may help him.

156
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:59,490
Otherwise you have information there and there.

157
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:14,730
-What other serious diseases you have gone through?

158
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:24,550
-I don't think I had any serious disease, I had pneumonia when I was a baby,

159
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:36,760
my mother told me and it was probably that occurrence from the lungs that went down

160
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:43,760
to the prostatitis. That infection.

161
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:46,250
-At what age?

162
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:49,920
-28.

163
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:54,830
-Then again or just once?

164
00:30:54,930 --> 00:31:06,610
-I had it for a whole summer. It was very difficult because I wanted to go to the toilet all the time.

165
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:16,450
-And it went away and never appeared?

166
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:26,110
-Then I had a cure with Sulphur again. It was the first time I had it.

167
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:36,860
I think during that summer I had difficult period with Sulphur.

168
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:48,110
-At the age of 28 you had bladder infection and at what age did you have the prostatitis?

169
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:54,710
10 years later?

170
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,040
-Yes. But all that time in between I felt that it was something wrong with this system.

171
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:05,690
-With the genito - urinary system?

172
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:11,060
-Yes. I forgot to tell that...

173
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:36,280
What I'm thinking now is the fact of cystitis was the after effect of having some contact with gonorrhea

174
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:45,620
and then repeated the bladder and then prostate, then Sulphur, Sulphur, Sulphur drugs?

175
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:54,280
Then antibiotics and then the symptoms of multiple sclerosis?

176
00:32:54,380 --> 00:33:08,530
This is what I'm thinking. Also what he said that it was a style the drinking, it was not a need.

177
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:22,070
This is not Sulphur. Sulphur has a need for drinking. It's the body that needs the alcohol.

178
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:29,070
Then he stops eventually. I doubt again the Sulphur.

179
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:34,570
You see all the story goes Sulphur, back to Medorrhinum, back to Sulphur, back to

180
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:43,290
Medorrhinum, back to Sulphur. I'm not ready for the Sulphur.

181
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:13,040
-I forgot to tell you...

182
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:25,740
You see something important. He didn't say something important.

183
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:37,220
Most probably he did not forget, he knows what he is talking about but he was kind of evaluating me,

184
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:44,170
should I say or should I not and then he decided to tell it.

185
00:34:51,670 --> 00:35:02,070
-I forgot to tell that the (?) it's away now.

186
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:05,650
-You don't have erections?

187
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:08,490
-No, very little.

188
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,600
-Desire you have?

189
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,320
-Yes.

190
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,740
-Very strong?

191
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:17,400
-Not very strong.

192
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:31,400
Now it's a new learning in the case, he says he is impotent.

193
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:50,560
Then I remembered that he was saying that these pains and the numbness from right to left

194
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:58,930
then immediately I say to myself is it Lycopodium? Because Lycopodium is impotent

195
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:03,720
and the symptoms start from the right side and go to the left.

196
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:23,140
And hypochondriasis or the anxiety about his health. It starts putting things together.

197
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:41,060
-It has nothing to do with my wife because I checked that.

198
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:47,310
-The desire you say it's not very much but it is there?

199
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:54,140
-Yes, there is attraction.

200
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:06,890
-Did you have a lot of sexual activity before?

201
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:14,880
-Not a lot, I don't think so.

202
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:19,890
-When this potency went down?

203
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:26,060
Do you see what I'm asking actually is do you have a lot of activity?

204
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:37,880
And then because of hyperactivity in sexual sphere you have impotence?This is to confirm Lycopodium.

205
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:45,220
I didn't want to put two questions. You had a lot of activity, you had impotence?

206
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:51,140
I'm just giving the possibility to think and to answer.

207
00:37:51,240 --> 00:38:01,140
Lycopodium can have a lot of activity which is not involving the emotional side,

208
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:13,140
it is just to satisfy the physical need and because of that eventually he becomes impotent

209
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:19,460
because potency comes when the whole person is overtaken by the feeling of affection, to give love.

210
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:38,670
If somebody does it on the physical level all the time, he is detaching in sex,

211
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:50,430
then sure impotency will come. Unless he is a very strong, earthly type person,

212
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:56,200
like the primitive type of person that we see in Africa.

213
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:15,000
-I don't think it started gradually but this winter I started to notice that it was something wrong.

214
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:29,090
If I'm thinking backwards perhaps it started earlier but now I noticed.

215
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:40,400
And I talked about it as well with my wife.

216
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:48,150
-Since last winter you've been taking more sleeping pills?

217
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:54,740
-Yes last winter I had been drinking more sleeping pills but last summer I had

218
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,200
sleeping pills as well.

219
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:07,200
I asked that because if somebody takes sleeping pills or barbiturates that calm down the system,

220
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:16,010
he may have, as side effect, impotency.

221
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:30,490
So when he says gradually, I did not have much activity, I'm not happy with Lycopodium situation here

222
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:41,280
but it is really Lycopodium based that impotency that has come after this (?)

223
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:48,610
-Now do you have to take a pill every night to sleep?

224
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:56,360
-No, I promised myself, last night I didn't take any and I slept for three hours.

225
00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:00,610
-At what time?

226
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:05,280
-I went to bed at 11 or 10.30.

227
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:12,110
-And you slept until 3?

228
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:28,900
-Yes, I had long way to go. I had leaved from home at six o'clock this morning and 100 km...

229
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:42,550
-If you don't take a sleeping pill, you will not be able to fall asleep? That's the pattern?

230
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:46,640
Late falling asleep.

231
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:50,890
-Yes and I get very warm.

232
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:53,910
-Then restless? Warm and restless?

233
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:55,550
-Yes.

234
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:57,380
-Do you uncover then?

235
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,970
-Yes, many times.

236
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:01,470
-You uncover all your body or mostly your feet?

237
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:05,610
-No, all my body.

238
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:11,500
-Was it in previous years that you wanted your feet uncovered?

239
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:17,140
-No, always I've been cold on my feet.

240
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:25,390
You see again the way of Lycopodium? I tried to confirm (?)

241
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:34,720
Sulphur keeps his feet out of cover, it's very warm and sticks his feet out of cover.

242
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:39,300
This is very characteristic of Sulphur. So not being able to confirm Lycopodium,

243
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:44,400
this is a case of Sulphur again, back to Sulphur.

244
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:48,160
And I put a direct question do you stick your feet out of cover?

245
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:53,350
He says no, not only I don't stick my feet but I want my feet covered.

246
00:42:53,450 --> 00:43:00,610
This is very seldom for a Sulphur case. You will see what follows.

247
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:14,700
-My feet have to be covered if I can rest.

248
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:19,690
-In order to rest they have to be covered, they have to be warm?

249
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:21,860
-Yes.

250
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,280
-But if you are warm, they are uncovered?

251
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:29,330
-Not only my feet.

252
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:40,270
-You keep special position in order to go to sleep?

253
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:50,610
-Yes that has changed. I used to be on my side but now I'm sleeping like this,

254
00:43:50,710 --> 00:44:01,860
I don't know why and crossing my legs.

255
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:05,520
Which is the remedy that sleeps in this position?

256
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:10,440
Rhododendron.

257
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:18,480
Again there is no confirmation for Sulphur which sleeps mostly on the side.

258
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:26,520
Most they say I sleep in the side because if I sleep on my back, I get a nightmare.

259
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:31,850
That's a good symptom for Sulphur, that's why I put all these questions and I get an answer

260
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:39,110
of Rhododendron.

261
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:48,590
-In your back?

262
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:56,510
-Yes and that's the way I lie if I want to take a rest on the sofa.

263
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:31,960
-You are a person that generally is aggravated by warm weather?

264
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:40,010
-I like warm weather but the best years of my life I was in Kenya and last year I have been

265
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:43,920
twice in Spain.

266
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:47,680
-And you like this warm weather?

267
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:49,840
-Yes.

268
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:58,510
-I want to stay here, to buy a house but I didn't do it because I have still pain.

269
00:45:58,610 --> 00:46:07,460
The pain has gone but I've been in warm weather.

270
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:16,420
Sulphur is a warm person, as you know, aggravated by warm.

271
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:33,910
And he tells I was best in Kenya. Best in Kenya? He goes to Spain to buy a house

272
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:41,140
because it is warm and he feels best in Kenya.

273
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:55,130
-Then I felt very sorry. I went home again.

274
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:09,710
-When you are in bed, then you become very warm and then you don't like the warm?

275
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:13,300
-Yes.

276
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:29,720
And sometimes if I fall asleep, I wake up wet all over because of perspiration

277
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:43,050
and particularly, if I take one glass of water or wine.

278
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:49,460
-The wine gives you headache or any other problems?

279
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:50,720
-No.

280
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:53,520
-Only this perspiration?

281
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:56,050
-Yes.

282
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:23,940
You see this big pause? Now what? We start all over again.

283
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:32,360
Putting things together again, I look again the case, I look my notes.

284
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:37,020
Now where are we going from here?

285
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:45,280
It's Sulphur, no Medorrhinum, no Sulphur, Medorrhinum, Lycopodium.

286
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:57,310
Why Lycopodium, maybe Sulphur again...This is a problem.

287
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:28,530
If you see his eyes really, he is not happy, he is not satisfied.

288
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:41,110
There is a look there, you feel the doubt.

289
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:52,860
-If the weather is cold and wet or warm and wet, you are affected?

290
00:49:52,960 --> 00:50:05,540
-Yes if it is wet and cold, I don't feel comfortable and I like when it's very warm inside the house.

291
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:16,500
If I'm aching, I fill a bathroom with hot water, as hot as I can, and even more hot water,

292
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:21,330
to get warm.

293
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:36,500
Now I go completely to different remedies; cold and wet aggravates him and very warm

294
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:44,500
bath ameliorates him. Is it Rhus tox, Calcarea carbonica or Dulcamara, Rhododendron?

295
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:49,000
What it is? A new line opinion.

296
00:50:49,100 --> 00:51:00,250
So far I've lost all this and we will have a chance finally but this is how

297
00:51:00,350 --> 02:00:33,520
I feel at the moment. I do not know, I doubt.
