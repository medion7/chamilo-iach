1
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,560
Her main complaint is bronchiectasis  and she is having it since childhood.

2
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:29,980
Her chest was worse in winter, worse in the evening, she has yellow-green catarrh,

3
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,080
she has a...  on the left side, very low energy which is much worse

4
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:40,020
when she is emotionally upset, she passed pneumonia at 18 months,

5
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:45,960
she had a mastoid in the right ear at age three which was treated with bandages

6
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:52,460
for six months, and she is deaf in the right ear now, she had chicken pox at four years

7
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,790
and then her left ear drum burst and so her hearing is now quite poor.

8
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:04,340
She's had catarrh and chest infections continuously with discharging ears.

9
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,790
She had deafness in her teens and they thought she was stupid

10
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:15,790
because it affected her work so much but she worked very hard to prove

11
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:20,390
that she was not stupid. She was not that good.

12
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:28,790
At 20 she had pneumonia and after this time she had several operations to drain her sinuses

13
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:35,780
and then they put local anesthetics to do this and many antibiotics

14
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,140
and finally they diagnosed the bronchiectasis in her early 20's.

15
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:48,780
In 1971 she had a duodenal ulcer which was complicated by...

16
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,030
She had tuberculosis and she caught this from another patient.

17
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:03,770
She was working in the hospital at the time and this was treated with streptomycin,

18
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:11,270
rifampicin and ethambutol for two months and she decided at the end of the two months

19
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,860
to stop the treatment and started taking tissue salts

20
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,480
because they wanted to continue the treatment but she decided to stop.

21
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:26,350
She had too many car accidents and in spite of being so ill she managed to keep her job

22
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:30,950
for 15 years and in spite of being told that she was invalid

23
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:35,290
and recently she had a D&C with fibroids.

24
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:42,450
-What is the D&C?
-Dilation and Curettage

25
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,350
Her relationship to men suffered tremendously due to her health

26
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:55,390
which she was always trying to hide from people, she never wanted anyone to say

27
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:56,110
that she is not well.

28
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,120
People don't know that she is not well.

29
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:10,870
She is very open about her feelings but resenting this for many years of being ill.

30
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,530
She is quite shy in company although she is not shy with me.

31
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:21,110
I think she is shy when she meets new people but not when she has a good contact with someone.

32
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:26,360
She lacks confidence and when she is emotionally upset she feels very ill.

33
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:32,610
-This is the case you took in the beginning or the now the present situation?

34
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:38,460
-The case I took in the beginning is very close and some symptoms were worse.

35
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:47,530
She had more pain in her ribs and more perspiration she had some symptoms a bit worse.

36
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:52,280
She takes everything to heart and very sensitive to external impressions.

37
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:57,200
She always thought time is very short.

38
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:04,350
When she is well, she is all right but she has tremendous anxiety about disease when she

39
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,020
is not feeling well. She has a fear of mice.

40
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,200
She has a fear of failure, she is quite loquacious, she is romantic,

41
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,130
she keeps her problems to herself.

42
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,770
...for relationship with someone but she is not promiscuous.

43
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:26,770
Her sexual energy she says is normal to strong but inside she feels very deep wariness.

44
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:32,520
She feels icy cold generally, cold extremities and at the moment

45
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:37,510
she has numbness in her fingers sometimes are so cold.

46
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,510
She hates the winter and she is generally better from heat.

47
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:50,760
Perspiration, night sweats twice the week now, she is doing treatment, now she is relapsed again.

48
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,360
They can be offensive.

49
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:02,840
The menses heavy bleeding, dark clots, considerate pain of the right ovary,

50
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,770
the bleeding sometimes stops during the day and it's profused at night.

51
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:11,540
This improved about a month, now again she is relapsed.

52
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:26,010
Food; she desires vegetables twice, fish twice, sour fruit twice, lemons twice,

53
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:35,760
onions, garlic, butter, she can eat the crispy fat of meat, sweets not very strong.

54
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:41,010
Very thirsty for water only at night and sometimes she gets up in the night

55
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,940
and she is hungry.

56
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:50,190
Her sleep is 8-10 hours per night, sometimes troubled and she wakes up unrefreshed.

57
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:57,590
The ears are still discharging a yellow, white offensive and sometimes brownish discharge

58
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,170
and it's ringing and humming  noises in the ears.

59
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:03,420
Very sensitive and she began salivating in the beginning of the treatment

60
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,030
and that comes and goes.

61
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:17,430
The first remedy she had was on October the 19th Mercury solubilis 1M and on December the 7th

62
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:21,930
that was repeated and then I went to discuss the case with another homeopath

63
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,330
and he thought Silica.

64
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:28,340
So I was confused how to get to Silica through...  whether I should go straight to Silica

65
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:33,510
or whether I should get through Hepar Sulphur and now what happened is she said

66
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:39,270
she wasn't well after the first remedy and that wasn't clear when I retook the case in December,

67
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,020
she was saying she wasn't well...

68
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,860
So now I'm going confused, there are many remedies I consider for her.

69
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,510
-Hepar Sulphur what has done?

70
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,270
-She was better for a while, she gets better all the time and then she relapses.

71
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,760
She is not as bad as she used to be.

72
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,760
-What are her main symptoms now?

73
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,260
-She has lots of little symptoms, they change all the time George.

74
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:17,270
-There is no difficulty in respiration?
-She is coughing a lot of sputum.

75
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:26,920
-What is the main complaint for her?
-Now she said her hands are numbed.

76
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,020
The numbness in her hands, the ringing in her ears.

77
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,260
-They have diagnosed Raynaud's syndrome?

78
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,750
-In the beginning because the pain in the chest and the weakness and the tiredness,

79
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:42,510
always in the telephone is the weakness and the tiredness and when am I going to be well

80
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:52,360
and I feel terrible and a lot of physical complaints to go with it.

81
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,340
I never have enough energy to cope.

82
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:12,930
-What is her main complaint? You never tried Tuberculinum?

83
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:22,320
-They are confused to look for which one it is, I can say that. Tuberculinum, Phosphorus, Calcarea ...

84
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:38,580
This is a case of bronchiectasis primarily with the main symptomatology

85
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,930
a very deep seated tiredness.

86
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:50,080
There is a very deep feeling of being tired, this is the main thing with the bronchiectasis.

87
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:55,150
She is a woman that has been through tuberculosis, through different hospitals

88
00:08:55,250 --> 00:09:04,420
and she has been treated quite a lot, brought eventually to that state with is great tiredness

89
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:12,810
and the production of the lungs, almost constant bringing up sputum with bronchiectasis,

90
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:17,150
which is X-rayed and which is radiological confirmed.

91
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,250
What you hear here in this case?

92
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:28,600
This case has been treated for a year before with different remedies which were Mercury,

93
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,200
Hepar sulphur, Silica... did you write all the remedies?

94
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:42,580
The impression of the practitioner is that all the time she is getting better but relapses,

95
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,100
getting better, relapses etc.

96
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:50,350
When you hear that story is not a good story.

97
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,010
It may indicate two things.

98
00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:00,250
One is that the prescribing was wrongly all the time, so it gave the impression

99
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:07,250
of an amelioration and then the person comes back without a real progress of the case.

100
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:12,600
The second possibility is that one of these remedies is correct,

101
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:19,750
brings about an amelioration for a short period of time, then it relapses.

102
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:27,750
An immediate amelioration would mean in such severe case which means

103
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:35,240
that the case mostly rather is incurable. You don't like in severe pathology case

104
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,100
an immediate amelioration, you don't like that.

105
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:46,000
And if you hear it, expect that in a short period of time the person will come back

106
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,830
and say I'm back again.

107
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:50,660
You give the same remedy, it does not work, you change the remedy,

108
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:56,590
it works a little bit and back again. Another remedy, works a little bit and back again.

109
00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:02,830
That is a bad observation, it means that the pathology is too deep

110
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:05,330
and most probably it is incurable.

111
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:16,000
Invariably in all the cases I have seen when the practitioner brings the case

112
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,510
and says the person reacted well to that remedy and he remained well for a month,

113
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:25,750
he remained well for 20 days, he remained well for this and this period of time...

114
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:32,250
And he says now I'm confused. You should not be confused,

115
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:37,240
a homeopath should know what is going on and why he should wait one time

116
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:40,490
and why he should not wait another time.

117
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:44,730
When you are going to prescribe, immediately almost the second day or the third day

118
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:49,470
after your prescription, you have to prescribe another remedy,

119
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:54,970
like another case of pneumonia that they brought me, neglected pneumonia

120
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:03,640
and they brought to me at 12 o'clock the case and I prescribed the remedy in America

121
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:09,150
and I said if by tomorrow morning she is not better, we will try another remedy

122
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,480
and then give antibiotics.

123
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:15,490
I mean there is no need to wait there. How long you are going to wait?

124
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:20,080
You cannot because the case is too severe, it has to react immediately.

125
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:24,720
In such severe case the reaction will be immediate.

126
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:31,230
You cannot say I think the remedy something has done and you wait very nicely

127
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:36,410
and if you go to sleep in the night you may wake up with a shock in the morning.

128
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:44,980
So don't come and tell me, George said you wait and wait, no.

129
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:49,830
George did not say you wait and wait. George said you can prescribe after two hours

130
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:55,660
if the person is dying, you are not going to wait next day because she will die tonight.

131
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,320
So your remedy has to act within two hours, it has to act within five hours,

132
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:04,660
it has to act within 20 hours, it has to act because of the severity of the case.

133
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:22,100
In this case we have the practitioner saying we have a little bit amelioration

134
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:28,100
and again back, amelioration and again back. The case is deep pathology

135
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:38,520
and the assessment is most probably the remedies were wrong but we will see now the case

136
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,370
and we will assess if this might be an incurable case.

137
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:57,020
-What are your main symptoms? What you would complain?

138
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:06,690
-My main symptom is my hearing problem. I can't interpret the word,

139
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:19,030
I can't make sense of a sentence. The other is my chest, it's wheezy.

140
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:24,610
-When?
-When I breathe.

141
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,430
-Have you noticed that?

142
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:40,010
I'd like to draw your attention to the question. I said what is your main problem?

143
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:46,600
When you have a case presented to you, the practitioner usually present it

144
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,670
with her own experience...

145
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:52,420
She has so many symptoms, does not know what symptom to give you first...

146
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,780
she gives you a heap of symptoms.

147
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:02,430
Now out of this heap of symptoms what is the most important? Why?

148
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:09,680
Because the remedy has to revolve around this main symptomatology.

149
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:18,010
Therefore as you go along with your study of Materia Medica and the study of our medicines,

150
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:27,520
you will realize that each of our medicines have the capacity and the ability to affect

151
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:35,620
certain areas of the body. Mostly the eyes.

152
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:40,760
If you see a case where most of the symptomatology is around his eyes,

153
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,520
eye problems...

154
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:57,350
your mind will go necessarily to Phystostigma or Ruta or remedies that have an ability

155
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:58,340
to affect the eye.

156
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:06,740
When you see the chest your mind will go to remedies that affect the chest or the liver.

157
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:18,430
I do not say give a remedy that affects the organ, don't misinterpret me

158
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:28,010
but the remedy has the capacity to affect what?

159
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:37,430
If somebody says my liver and my guts, my colon is affected that is a case

160
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:40,680
where you will think of Lycopodium?

161
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:46,760
Not necessarily because it affects both the liver and the colon, Lycopodium.

162
00:16:46,860 --> 00:17:11,910
When a person says my main problem is urinary infections, which is the main remedy

163
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:19,760
which is indicated in cystitis? Sarsaparilla.

164
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:26,160
You get an idea of the remedy in this way, not that Sarsaparilla is going to be the remedy

165
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:29,340
or Lycopodium is going to be the remedy but the idea is there.

166
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:35,330
Unless you think in this way I'm explaining to you, you will not find the remedy in this case.

167
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,620
This person comes and you say what is your main problem?

168
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,920
The practitioner presented the case, you had the case.

169
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:50,580
Now she comes and says my main problems are hearing problems and chest problems.

170
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:56,090
Did you hear that from the practitioner? Did you understand it from the practitioner? No.

171
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:02,410
He said, it's coughing, sputum, numbness, blah, blah, blah.

172
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:06,930
Now she comes and says hearing and chest problems.

173
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:18,180
Now you concentrate, you limit your possibilities a little bit more now on the remedies.

174
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:36,500
-Wheezing and difficulty in respiration?
-No.

175
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,450
-When the wheezing is more? In bed?

176
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:52,000
-If I'm flat and when I have tremendous tiredness.

177
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,580
-When the tiredness is mostly?

178
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:11,600
-If I'm strained with living, with general conditions?

179
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,340
-When you exert yourself physically?

180
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:26,590
-Not necessarily. When I'm in unhappy atmosphere.

181
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:47,550
The tiredness is worse when she is stressed, she is under stress, especially

182
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:54,050
when she is under mental stress, she feels very tired. It is a deep sense of tiredness

183
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:00,300
which you will not see it very frequently described in this way

184
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,140
because she will describe it again and again.

185
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,650
Can you find anything in the Repertory?

186
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:28,620
From mental exertion, weakness in generalities, worse from mental exertion?

187
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:42,370
It is Calcarea, Cuprum, Ferrum picricum, Lachesis  etc.

188
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:54,290
-You sleep 10 hours?
-8 to 10, 8 hours regularly.

189
00:20:54,390 --> 00:21:07,630
But then I need to catch up. But again if I'm very happy...

190
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:14,350
-In bed do you keep a position, left, right?

191
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:21,550
-No...

192
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:34,190
-When you wake up, you are very unrefreshed?
-No very refreshed.

193
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:37,200
-Sometimes unrefreshed?

194
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:48,690
-...I wake up very thirsty, I have to stop myself from a drink.

195
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:54,460
-You have great thirst?
-Yes at night.

196
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,540
-Does it have to be cold?
-Yes cold.

197
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,390
-Do you put ice?
-No ice, never, just cold.

198
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:18,970
-Did you ever have any bleeding on the lungs?

199
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:26,870
-Just before 3 years I think I might have been having in the sputum...

200
00:22:45,800 --> 00:23:10,200
But I get a tremendous cold hands and feet and numbed. I have to shake them.

201
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:14,050
-Both?
-Yes, particularly my right.

202
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:53,380
-I did not understand, did she say the hands become numbed because of the coldness or not?

203
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,370
-What did she say?

204
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:07,260
-She said that she had cold hands that become quite numbed.

205
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,770
-From cold?

206
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:19,200
-She didn't say directly... She has to shake them to become unnumbed.

207
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:27,200
-There is connection between the numbness and the coldness?

208
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:40,850
-Most probably she is a cold person and she is aggravated by cold and we have to understand

209
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:46,110
that this numbness and coldness comes from exposure to cold.

210
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:29,860
-...My eyes are very tired with the contact lenses, I have to take my contact lenses out...

211
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:34,010
-How many years do you wear contact lenses?

212
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:36,610
-Three years...

213
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:51,290
-Do you still have your menses?
-Yes, on and off.

214
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,970
-Menses are irregular?

215
00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:03,290
-They were regular but then I had a lot of bleeding...

216
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:11,720
-When you had your menses before there was a lot of blood?

217
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:18,130
-Yes and clotted...

218
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,970
-You told me it was very profuse.

219
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:36,570
-That was at...  and I had pain in my right ovary.

220
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:53,060
Has anybody thought about the remedy so far?

221
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:59,080
You have any idea about the remedy that maybe indicated?

222
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:22,580
Calcarea, Silica, Lycopodium, Phosphorus, Calcarea carbonica.

223
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:40,800
You have different opinions about the remedy because as we said the case is not clear.

224
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:47,450
So far the case is not clear and therefore if you take certain symptomatology

225
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:55,390
out of that you say Phosphorus, if you take another symptomatology you say Calcarea, Silica etc.

226
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:01,110
But you cannot put together things and say this is the remedy.

227
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:05,710
You can argue for any remedy, it is not clear.

228
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:15,960
It indicates for progressed pathology and difficult cases the remedy is not apparent

229
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:23,570
and you have to be very careful in your first prescribing because we can spoil these cases

230
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,070
by repeating too many remedies, giving too many remedies.

231
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:31,820
And then you can lose the picture all together and you cannot find it

232
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:37,570
and even if a master comes he cannot find it because they are masked,

233
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:39,910
symptoms have changed.

234
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:46,810
This is the most unfortunate situation and this is why we don't like the complex remedies

235
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:51,180
that they suppress symptoms, they cloud the symptoms.

236
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:56,070
That's why we say you have to be careful. If you give 10 remedies here, what is going to happen?

237
00:28:56,170 --> 00:29:01,800
Some of these remedies will affect the symptomatology in one way or another

238
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:05,660
and you will lose the real picture of the case.

239
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:29,950
-Many things but I can't get the right word...

240
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:59,440
-It was full moon, that has an effect to me. I don't know.

241
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:03,700
-That was one time?
-No, every time after few weeks...

242
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:13,380
I begin to wonder if it is tight up with the full moon.

243
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:36,550
I get a pain in the right breast just quite a shock, a hot pain, I feel a hot feeling.

244
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,930
-How do you feel emotionally?

245
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:16,530
-The other day I was... and I got emotional...I'm helpless.

246
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:26,110
-You mean you cried?
-Yes in a way...

247
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:54,110
-Can you describe your character?

248
00:31:54,610 --> 00:32:02,320
-Up and down in a way. How to describe my character?

249
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:08,610
...I can be hard but I can be very sympathetic...

250
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:44,780
I like to be with people and I like uplifting situations and if someone has got a problem...

251
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:53,930
-Do you have a lot of enjoyment? Do you enjoy life?

252
00:32:54,030 --> 00:33:00,670
-I like to... where my limitations are, I can't do much, I wouldn't dare...

253
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:16,110
The same with sports.

254
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:38,610
-The biggest fear that you have what is?
-Fear of mice.

255
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:51,010
-The biggest fear she has is fear of mice, what is the remedy?

256
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:58,610
Calcarea carbonica has fear of mice.

257
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:11,840
Can you tell me so far, what symptoms you have noted down

258
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:17,200
and how you will look so far in the Repertory?

259
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:33,970
-Worse from mental exertion, great thirst.

260
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:37,090
-Thirst underlined perhaps 2-3 times.

261
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:41,440
-Cold.
-Cold underlined two times.

262
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:56,820
-She is very loquacious. She is trying to please you.

263
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,420
-Yes.

264
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:03,340
-Sympathetic maybe.

265
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:07,430
-What about other symptoms?

266
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:24,010
-She does not want people to know that she is not well.

267
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:37,090
-Wheezing.

268
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:57,340
-Bad hearing.
-Both ears are affected.

269
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,510
-Desires company.

270
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:36,260
-Pain in the right ovary during menses and pain on right breast.

271
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:52,240
-She works, she is high spirited or something like that.

272
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:01,990
-Hopeful.
-Cheerful.

273
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:10,240
-Tired in full moon.

274
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:40,750
-Memory weak.
-Refined.

275
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,510
-Why you say refined?
-I have that impression.

276
00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:07,080
-Icy cold hands and feet and numbness.

277
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:20,480
Can you look in your Repertory now if you have enough symptoms?

278
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,530
Can you tell me the remedy now?

279
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,740
Why you cannot tell the remedy?

280
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:46,650
You have enough symptoms already, perhaps quite a lot but you cannot tell the remedy.

281
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:51,220
Why?
-No peculiar symptoms.

282
00:38:51,320 --> 00:39:01,070
-You see here we have symptoms that are not peculiar, we do not have keynotes

283
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:14,990
to be guided and also some of these symptoms are our own subjective observations.

284
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:23,390
Maybe they are not true, maybe some other symptoms we did not hear well

285
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:30,490
and we did not pay attention to what might have been peculiar in that symptom.

286
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:38,490
All these reasons make up for a confusion, that's why the case now is confused.

287
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:48,900
Nobody can tell me the remedy. Does anybody think that because of this,

288
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,980
this and that symptom the remedy is that?

289
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:59,840
If you go to the Repertory and you look, you will see several symptoms, polychrests

290
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,930
but not the remedy.

291
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:13,440
During the interval think about the remedy and when we come back I'm sure you will know it.

292
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,430
Do you see the confusion?

293
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:25,710
She will get one remedy and she is going to have a reaction.

294
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:32,670
It is a big reaction, it is a reaction that you may think it's a wrong reaction,

295
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:41,730
she is getting mentally... bizarre symptoms but you will see the whole class will say now

296
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:44,070
this is the remedy.

297
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:52,740
You will see how much clear the second remedy is going to be that almost the whole class,

298
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:59,490
I don't know your level of excellence but seeing the attention that you pay to all

299
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:03,590
these nonsense I'm talking about that means your level is quite high!

300
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:11,010
Let's see a little bit more because there are some hints.

301
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:15,610
Of course how I prescribed the remedy, it's not intuition, I've put things together.

302
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:23,240
I didn't pay attention to some, I paid attention to some others, I evaluated the case.

303
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:33,080
Also for those people that come for the first time I have to say that I have been accused

304
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:42,010
for being a 'Kentian', they say Vithoulkas is a Kentian, that I follow Kent too much.

305
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:48,010
He is a Kentian, forget him, don't pay attention to him.

306
00:41:50,010 --> 00:42:01,670
And it is true the one who really taught me is Kent. I've learned most I know from Kent.

307
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:09,910
Yet I realized very early that whatever is written here in this book

308
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:16,270
which we call Kent's Repertory is not absolute.

309
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:26,410
That means if I have a remedy, if I have a case and present a symptom like fear of mice

310
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:30,660
but here I see only Calcarea carbonica, this is not absolute.

311
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:37,920
It doesn't mean that I cannot go away from Calcarea carbonica because in fear of mice

312
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:41,170
Calc carbo is the only one which is mentioned here.

313
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:47,080
That means there are some omissions in the Repertory, there are some remedies

314
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:52,340
that have symptoms that have not been recorded here in this Repertory.

315
00:42:53,680 --> 00:43:01,680
And also there are other symptoms which are recorded in a false way,

316
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:06,690
paying too much attention or paying too little attention.

317
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:13,500
So we have to add and to refine the Repertory and if you come

318
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:18,240
and say this is not in the Repertory...Every time I face the same situation.

319
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:23,750
This is not in the Repertory, I say OK that does not mean anything.

320
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:28,980
It means that this remedy that I'm going to give perhaps has also fear of mice

321
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,700
and it is not recorded in the Repertory.

322
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:36,770
That's all it means, if that is going away by the remedy I gave.

323
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:44,660
Or it might mean another thing that underneath the remedy I'm going to prescribe,

324
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:51,010
there is another remedy, maybe Calcarea carbonica, which is coming later on.

325
00:43:52,870 --> 00:44:02,770
So there are some symptoms always that come from...

326
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,960
-Other layer.

327
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:15,450
-What you are interested always is the first layer.

328
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:24,680
The first layer is Ignatia, you have to give Ignatia but in this layer of Ignatia,

329
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:36,400
which underneath has, let us say a symptom here, which is desires salt...

330
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:41,600
Desires salt is the symptom but appears together with the symptoms of Ignatia,

331
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:49,090
it appears desires salt but actually it is the second remedy that we should have been given.

332
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:56,340
But it pops out one or two symptoms of Natrum muriaticum but most are symptoms of Ignatia,

333
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:03,600
give Ignatia first and then Nat mur. If you go the other way around, it's not going to work.

334
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:34,110
-You don't like the cats?
-I don't want to have a cat...

335
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:40,010
-Are you afraid?

336
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:50,510
Do you hear that? What is this? A kind of aversion to cats.

337
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:54,600
What is the remedy?
-Tuberculinum.

338
00:45:57,350 --> 00:46:02,350
-The lungs are affected, Tuberculinum.

339
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:08,580
You see, you have not been thinking of Tuberculinum before.

340
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,580
Now with this information in your mind comes Tuberculinum.

341
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:17,180
You retake the case and you look through the case, does it fit to Tuberculinum?

342
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:20,930
It fits?

343
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:57,430
-I'm not disgusted, I don't like cats. Anything that smells. Membrane...

344
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:09,830
-You are afraid of disease? You are concerned?
-No.

345
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:14,630
-Do you have any fear during thunderstorms?

346
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:16,830
-No I enjoy them.

347
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:29,990
Enjoying thunderstorm, what is the remedy?
-Sepia.

348
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:39,260
-Very good, you know your Repertory quite good. Is this Sepia? Can be Sepia?

349
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:45,990
The physic is like Sepia very much because she is thin. Her physique is like Sepia.

350
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:51,590
Sepia can be affected in the lungs? Yes it can be affected in the lungs.

351
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:58,240
Tuberculinum can be affected in the ear? Not so much, a little bit.

352
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,500
Again the same question.

353
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:07,910
What she tells now, she gives some keynotes the last few times.

354
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:21,910
Tuberculinum, enjoying thunderstorms, I asked for Phosphorus and she comes out

355
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:25,010
with an answer which indicates Sepia.

356
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:33,640
Is this Sepia? Is this Tuberculinum? Is this Calc carbo? This comes to my mind.

357
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:57,840
-You speak very fast, can you speak a little bit more slow because I'm not English.

358
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:59,680
-Sorry.

359
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:22,140
-When you talk, after talking you get tired?
-No.

360
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:30,470
Why did I ask this question?
-Stannum.

361
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:38,480
-If she complains about a deep tiredness and she is a person she had tuberculosis,

362
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:51,000
with the deep tiredness the remedy that has this pathology very much is Stannum.

363
00:49:52,000 --> 00:50:03,250
Stannum is a tubercular remedy with a deep sense of tiredness, with sputum coming out.

364
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:07,480
For years she brings out sputum.

365
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:13,980
In Stannum when the person coughs immediately comes big lumps

366
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:18,330
of mucus comes out and tiredness.

367
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:34,710
But Stannum has tiredness especially when talking, then it gets tired.

368
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:43,960
If this person would say I just talk in the telephone half a minute and I'm exhausted,

369
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:50,300
that becomes a keynote of Stannum and might be a case of Stannum.

370
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:55,400
The answer is no, I don't get tired when I talk.

371
00:50:55,900 --> 00:51:02,790
Also knowing what I know about Stannum, this cannot be a case of Stannum.

372
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:09,550
Stannum is too tired to laugh, too tired to communicate in this.

373
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:14,390
What is this tiredness, what is the peculiar characteristic of this tiredness

374
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:17,390
is that it's a deep seated tiredness.

375
00:51:17,490 --> 00:51:22,810
It's not on the physical level almost, it's a tiredness on the mental level almost.

376
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:36,400
It's a very deep background tiredness that holds her back and she cannot continue to do things.

377
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:40,880
Stannum is not like that, it's more physical.

378
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:45,980
What is the most tired remedy, more than Stannum?

379
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:52,970
-Muriatic acid.
-Picric acid.

380
00:51:53,070 --> 00:52:00,970
-Picric acid on a mental level very tired. Phosphoric acid on an emotional level very tired.

381
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:13,470
When we say emotional, no emotions, inside flatness but physically it will keep on doing things.

382
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:26,880
Picric acid the mind stops, cannot produce thoughts. Picric acid will make a big effort

383
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:32,810
to understand a simple sentence, tremendous tiredness on a mental level.

384
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:45,310
Muriatic acid- I'm talking about the three acids- is a physical tiredness, exhaustion.

385
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:53,880
The emotions may be there acting, the mind in Muriatic acid will work

386
00:52:53,980 --> 00:53:00,140
but the physical part of the human being is so tired.

387
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:06,880
Stannum also is physically tired. There is another remedy which is physically tired,

388
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:11,130
which is Gelsemium.

389
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:16,220
There is a very seldom indicated remedy, which is very tired and especially

390
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:23,810
when they try to move they are producing flushes.

391
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:27,310
-Helonias

392
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:36,130
-Who said Helonias very good. Have you heard it from me?

393
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:38,490
-Yes.

394
00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:42,890
-Very good, he remembers it. Many heard it but they don't remember it.

395
00:53:50,650 --> 00:53:57,050
Now here is again a case of tiredness. This is a new kind of tiredness, see this tiredness,

396
00:53:57,150 --> 00:54:02,380
put it in your mind. Now if you meet it again, you will recognize it

397
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:04,990
in the remedy I'm going to prescribe.

398
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:13,130
-Do you like talking?

399
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:24,740
-Yes sometimes. I realize I repeat myself.

400
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:56,400
I investigated the possibility of Lachesis.

401
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:01,890
-Do you like fish quite a lot?

402
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:19,790
You see the practitioner, if you remember, says desire for fish and that misguided me

403
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:29,300
because if the practitioner says this is this, your mind is not guided properly.

404
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:38,730
But you see I never trust anybody ever.

405
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:47,630
You say yes and I sit back and I think to myself, is this yes? Why it's yes, why it's not?

406
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:56,550
I've learned because of human experience that there are many reasons why we could not trust.

407
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:01,050
Because people do not themselves know what they are talking about,

408
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:06,380
because they want to mislead you, because they think it's better if I tell this and not this,

409
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:12,130
because of many reasons we twist facts.

410
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:24,130
We present facts in a not straightforward manner and what we need here is the language

411
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:28,290
of the defense mechanism which is not the mind.

412
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:35,950
The defense mechanism says give me salt, give me salt and the mind says no salt,

413
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:44,530
no salt. Give me salt, no salt and then the mind put the stamp, it says no salt.

414
00:56:44,630 --> 00:56:52,780
Then he comes to your examining room and you say do you desire salt? No.

415
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:59,290
Do you have an aversion to salt? Yes aversion to salt and then in his yes

416
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:07,360
I see in his memory something is not clear, something bothers him,

417
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:09,110
he does not even understand it.

418
00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:19,620
I say did you decide not to have salt? Yes. Did you use to desire salt? Yes.

419
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:24,210
How much? I take salt and I eat it like that.

420
00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:29,610
And you come to tell me that you have aversion to salt and I write aversion to salt,

421
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:31,460
that's not right.

422
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:36,860
You misguided me completely because your mind decided not to have salt

423
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:41,210
and you managed to do it...

424
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:46,360
Then what shall I take into consideration? The language of the mind

425
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:48,380
or the language of the defense mechanism?

426
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:52,370
I'm interested in the language of the defense mechanism, what is coming forward

427
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:58,460
from an instinctive level, that's what I'm interested. Otherwise I have no way.

428
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:06,450
We can disguise all our symptoms. The stories I have heard about the symptoms...

429
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:10,270
Why this pain is there and not there.

430
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:19,530
That is why you will find it more easy to treat people that come from villages, uneducated.

431
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:29,280
They have strong constitution, fish? Yes I take fish and I eat it, this is the language.

432
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:37,780
Give me sweet or salt yes I take this or I have this pain, it's clear.

433
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:43,940
You get a sophisticated man from town and you are lost. You don't know

434
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:51,700
what he has decided himself and what his organism has decided, it's a mixture of the two

435
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:54,630
and that's why I say I don't trust.

436
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:14,030
-You like fruits?

437
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:21,610
-Yes all fruits, particularly not so much the very sweet.

438
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:23,950
-You prefer the sour?
-Yes.

439
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:26,110
-Do you prefer unripe fruits?

440
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:28,220
-Slightly unripen.

441
00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:49,060
She prefers unripe fruits, is this a case of Calcarea sulphuricum,

442
00:59:49,160 --> 01:00:06,490
is this a case of Medorrhinum, of Veratrum? Sour fruits.

443
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:23,620
-When you drink water you will drink a whole glass or you drink a little bit?

444
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:28,980
-No, a whole glass. I take a jar to bed.

445
01:00:31,470 --> 01:00:35,120
-You drink the whole lot until the morning?

446
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:37,470
-Sometimes yes.

447
01:00:45,630 --> 01:00:56,290
-Do you like salty things?
-Yes. I don't take salt.

448
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:57,790
-Why because it's no good?

449
01:00:57,890 --> 01:01:06,140
-No, no because it takes the flavor of food, I put half of it in herbs.

450
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:16,140
-If it is salty you don't like it?
-I don't enjoy it.

451
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:35,540
If it was Phosphorus this case would she give this answer for salt?

452
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:36,800
-No.

453
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:41,530
-The most probable would be that desire for salt is there for Phosphorus.

454
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:47,400
If she was Calcarea carbonica, most probably desire for salt would be there.

455
01:01:47,890 --> 01:01:50,890
Both desire for salt and desire for sweets.

456
01:01:56,910 --> 01:02:06,290
What I'm struggling here is it Calcarea, Tuberculinum, Phosphorus, Sepia, Stannum

457
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:14,640
what it is? Now I have come to the conclusion what it is. I've shorted it out.

458
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:25,800
It is none of these remedies. You will hear and I believe you will understand what I'm thinking.
